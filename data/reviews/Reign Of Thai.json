{"text":"We ordered to-go last night. Both got chicken pad Thai, mine NOT spicy and his level 3 (of 5). The noodles didn't stick together and it still hot when it got to our house (helped that we were only 2 miles away). He said his delicious but almost too spicy to eat. (And he can normally handle level 3). Mine had almost no flavor and some bites had a weird after taste."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet and was blown away! Not the greatest location, I was a little weary at first.  But, I was proven wrong because the food was out of this world.  I have been to numerous thai places around the valley and this is by FAR the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food for a very reasonable price. I especially recommend their noodle dishes. They encourage BYOB, which makes this warm little restaurant even more appealing!"}
{"text":"Came into town from Utah for a little getaway. We are fans of Thai food and thought we'd check out a local restaurant. I think we chose well. I ordered the red curry at a spice level of 4. 5 is the highest. I think 4 was good for when I want to be a little uncomfortable but still enjoy the meal. Chicken fried rice, pad Thai and red curry (spice level 1) were also at the table. All good, according to the party. Would definitely return but maybe choose spice levels one step down. Most Thai places I've been to in Utah that have a \"native hot\" (tends to be the highest on the scale) designation don't tend to serve food spicier than what I had at Reign."}
{"text":"Pricey for a buffet, and every time we have gone, the meet has been picked out of the dishes, or the dishes are empty....not going back.  There are too many great Thai restaurants in our area that offer good service and food for a great price."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. The food was FABULOUS and the staff was friendly. I ordered the crab puffs as an appetizer and unlike many other places where the puffs are mostly cream cheese and a hint of crab these were equally proportioned and you could actually see and taste the crab! I also ordered the yellow curry with chicken- spice level 1 and it was delicious!! Just the right amount of curry for a fabulous flavor but not so hot that I couldn't eat it.  For my entree, the crab puffs and my soft drink it was $26.30 before the tip but I feel it was worth the price. My whole experience was great, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if you know what good Thai food is, which I think I do, I would Not eat here. Curry I ordered mild was too spicy to taste, the Thai Tea was too sweet and the Pad Thai had too much garlic and I ordered chicken, but the Pad Thai they gave me had Shrimp, I was very disappointed, my husband is allergic to shellfish therefore it was inedible for him."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley. Been here 2-3 times and every time the food quality is amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Food was delicious and spicy like no other. Great customer service and super friendly which made everything that much better. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"One of the best places I have been in a long time  They need to get a better air conditioner but the food is worth the visit"}
{"text":"I go here several times a week. I don't like buffets but the lunch buffet here is top notch. Also great for low carb dieting since it's all you can eat veggies and protein."}
{"text":"I have traveled all over the world, including Thailand.  I have been to Thailand many, many times.  The food here is superb and very authentic!  I love dining there when I am in Arizona!  Love the food!  Do yourself a favor and savor the many fine and diverse flavors of this restaurant.  Make sure you get an order of the spring rolls!  I pity the fool who does not dine there at least once!  WhoooHoooo Tim"}
{"text":"One of the great lunch dining experiences in this impoverished dining region of Phoenix is the Reign of Thai.  Daily, the chef produces a reasonably priced luncheon buffet that is hard to surpass.  A lover curry, there are many offerings.  In fact you have two choices of soups and 12 choices including the popular pad thai. Have taken guests there.  Everyone loves the choices, quality, and price."}
{"text":"Close to the best Thai food I've ever had, definitely the best in the neighborhood. First time trying it last night and I'm glad I did. Found my go-to Thai restaurant! Owner was friendly and genuine, service was spot-on. And the FOOD was delicious. Shrimp Satay with peanut sauce, Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, spice level 2 was about medium, pretty spicy, and I like spice! Mango sweet rice...I thought I couldn't eat another bite after dinner, but could not stop with the addictive mango sweet rice. Great sized portions for reasonable prices. They do not allow BYOB but are working on obtaining their liquor license. Can't wait for that. Regardless, we will be going back soon and often!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. But I always end up trying the same entree. That is why this place is so great. I don't know of any other place that has a Thai food all you can eat buffet. I tried five different Currys, two different noodle dishes, two different soups, and everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Great Lunch Buffet! Must come for dinner also! I'm adding all sorts of words so yelp will make it a review and not a tip. How stupid! My cherrie has been broken!"}
{"text":"Stay away! The food from the buffet is not worth ten dollars...I wouldn't eat it if it was free.As I write this I have a stomach ache after one medium size plate of food."}
{"text":"Great food! Hard location to find. I love the yellow curry here! The spicy food here is great. A lot of flavors to love."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Phoenix. The curries are fragrant and thick, with lots of fresh veggies and the noodle dishes authentic and flavorful. Good portion sizes and Satsay and his staff (family?) are very polite and accommodating. They have a small kitchen and sometimes the wait can be longer than usual, but the food is well worth it. I moved away from Phoenix recently, but whenever work brings me back, this is the first restaurant I visit. Don't be dissuaded by reviews complaining about the wait, otherwise you may miss out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic assortment of Thai favorites. All the typical curries you'd expect and even Panang and Massaman as well. Ginger chicken, eggplant, basil chicken, Tom kah, and so much more.  Great selection, great spice and sauce options, great service.  Wish I had one in my town!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food in either ala carte of buffet format that is available for lunch most days. This was formerly known as Pete's Thai, which was excellent but which used a high spice level not all my friends enjoyed. Now you can use a seasoning bar with a dozen plus items to season to taste. They are friendly, trying hard and using all fresh ingredients they purchase daily or close to it. Definitely worth a try if you like traditional Thai food and really being able to taste all the many fresh herbs and spices in each dish."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Excellent lunch buffet, spring rolls, staff and they have a BYOB option."}
{"text":"We pass this restaurant daily going home, but I was nervous to try it, but the comments on Yelp changed our minds.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because I had to call six times before anyone answered the phone to place our order for pickup.  We ordered the yellow and green curry (level1) and the crab puffs. The food was delicious, my only complaint is that they didn't give enough rice to go with the amount of curry ordered.  Prices were good for the amount of food we received.  Definitely order level 1 if you're not much for spicy as it made my nose run. Anything spicier would have been too much for us.  Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I have been here several times since it changed owners. The food is good. A little less spicy with the new chef.  Service is great!! Great for vegans"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food we have found in the valley.  The Ginger chicken is exquisite with vegetables that are absolutely fresh and not overcooked. I ordered a 1 on the spice scale and it was still more mildly ginger than hot. The cashew chicken is also great. Dakota was our server and made it a great experience.  I don't want this place to be packed all the time so I hesitate to review but it would not be fare to say...Well done!"}
{"text":"Speaking only of the buffet as this is all we experienced, I don't understand the high ratings from previous reviewers. The food lacked flavor which was just wrong. It's Thai food! I even overlooked the lack of heat (spice) because it was buffet. Won't revisit this establishment."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the fact that it's next to a car repair shop. The food is really good, the servings are generous, and the staff are really friendly and have a sense of humor.   Their curries are excellent, as is their pad thai. It's also very vegetarian friendly.   This is my go-to place for Thai food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My last thai restaurant has disappointed twice in a row so I decided to try a new one! I LOVED IT. I got the paneng curry with beef (thai spicy) and the rice paper spring rolls and oh my gosh... never been happier. The curry is in this 32 Oz container and has PLENTY of beef. I was very proud that Thai spicy tasted like how it was supposed taste- firey hot in my tummy. And let me tell you about the spring rolls. That are the length of a burrito!! The shrimp was nice and soft. Delicious all around!"}
{"text":"Super clean, extremely friendly staff, and amazing food. Had the coconut soup, pad Thai, and panang curry and even my two toddlers were licking their plates! Definitely going to try the lunch buffet sometime and next time will bring some wine along bc it's byob."}
{"text":"Totally messed up my to go order. Every dish was wrong. The manager was totally rude and wouldn't redo the dishes. Seriously the worst service I've had at any restaurant in the valley. The only reason I went there is because they never have a wait. I can see why now. Avoid."}
{"text":"We have been here a lot since the first time! We have brought plenty of new customers too! This by far is the best Thai food ever. Very fresh and never had anything bad. Now when we go there we tell them to surprise us and they have! We will try everything on the menu! Customer service is great!! See you all soon!! Good beer and wine too!"}
{"text":"Very good and authentic. Very much worth it if your looking for really great Tai food."}
{"text":"We went here for the lunch buffet yesterday.  I loved the food, the staff was attentive and friendly.  They do a pretty good lunch business and the food was replenished quickly.  It is a small comfortable place with good food, so how can you go wrong.  We ordered from the menu for dessert (coconut ice cream with fried bananas) and it was huge and delicious.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Thai Place in the Valley! We don't live close by but visit regularly because it is sooo worth the drive! The food is delicious, service is perfect and the quality is consistently outstanding! We typically get the yellow chicken curry, green chicken curry and try a new dish each time. We just tried the cashew chicken last night and it was delicious! This is a must try place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So impressed. I have been wanting to try a Thai buffet to sample different curries. This place did not disappoint. Clean and open seating with a great buffet. Really enjoyed the variety of food. Fresh, great veggies, fantastic spice. The curries were delicious, I My favorites were the green and yellow curry . I was less excited about the Pad Thai but also think that a buffet isn't the best for that. . Will be back again. Service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Great food, check your spice level at the door. They can make it hot if you like. Fast friendly service. Not over bearing, yet very attentive. Ott is a very pleasant and will take time to chat with you. He always makes us feel welcome.   Thanks Ott."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and love this restaurant! The food is always fantastic, as are the owners and staff. I feel like family when I come here. Highly recommended, my favorite Thai spot (and I've tried many). I usually get spicy noodles, and when in season the mango sticky rice is incredible."}
{"text":"Love this place. The family is cute and friendly. The good is fantastic and tastes authentic. Highly recommend. Yummy! Now if they could just be open a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great place. The coconut soup is the best. Just give yourself time. The service is not the best but the food makes up for it. It in the aamco parkinglot. The lighting outside is not good. But it is all worth it"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time 2 weeks ago.  Service was great! The owner was taking care of the front bc his server called out sick.  He was so nice and friendly and really cared about making his customers happy.     For that they get an extra star.       It was clean, bright, and decor was nice.  Food was delicious, everything was fresh and nice."}
{"text":"All out 5 stars.  Too bad we waited so long to finally eat here.  We went late on a Sunday night.  We made it in just before they stopped seating according to some rules posted out front.  The staff was very friendly.  We interacted directly with 3 staff members that were present in the dining room.  The buffet was not available as late as we were there, but the menu was extensive.  I had the Spicy Noodles and, when asked about the 1-5 spicy scale, I told them \"as hot as you make it\".  My wife ordered the Crispy Fish at a 2 spicy.  My kids had the Teriake Beef at a 1 spicy and with fried rice.   As we waited for our order, two of the staff let me know that nobody had ordered a 5 all day so they had not called any ambulances.  I like spicy, but they did put a bit of fear into me with those statements.  Alas, the order came.  I tried everybody else's meals prior to tasting my own.  The fish was really good.  I didn't pick up on the spicy, really, but throughout the meal, my wife kept telling me that she coudn't believe I was eating a 5 since hers was so hot (and she likes hot).  The Teriaki Beef with fired rice was OUTSTANDING.  I will be ordering that dish next time, probably at a 3 or 4 spicy so as not to kill the flavor too much.  My Spicy Noodles dish, again, was OUTSTANDING.  Sure, it was hot, but the flavors of the beef and the bell peppers and some other spiced that were present still came through amongst that spice.  I always say that you can add pepper to anything and make it hot, but it takes a talented chef to still allow those other flavors to remain, and Reign of Thai's chef can do that very very well.  We are going back this week.  I have no doubts that we are going to enjoy being regulars here and I recommend that you give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! delicious food!! Great quantity!! Best Thai food ever had!! Must try!! Beautiful ambiance, not typically like in other Thai restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food. Check. Friendly wait staff. Check. Homey feel. Check.  Thoughtfully decorated. Check.  Give this place a visit! :-)"}
{"text":"Reign of Thai is the best Thai food in the valley. The yellow curry is perfect! Everything on the menu is yummy. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I give it a one star because the food was good but the service was extremely poor. We had two different waiters one of them was not so very nice . We had the green curry ( spice level 1) and it was soo spicy. We asked him if it was a level 1 and said it was spicy but he responded with \" Oh it's just naturally spicy .\" Like he didn't want to take it bake remake it. The other guy was nice and said I'm sorry for everything."}
{"text":"I have never seen such a worst buffet restaurant in my life. Very few variety of food with just 2 starters and no dessert.10.99 for this buffet restaurant is just waste of money."}
{"text":"We thought there wasn't any good Thai restaurants in Phoenix after living here for 5 years. Our neighbor told us about Reign of Thai.  Absolutely fantastic!  A must try."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have an excellent lunch buffet and the staff is awesome. One of the owners who is also one of the chefs even came out to talk to us when I had a question about one of their dishes. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house. Thought I'd give it a shot. Restaurant was not that busy and there were three wait staff. Wait staff was very friendly, BUT service was very poor. Prices were also over priced for the portion sizes. Not a terrible place, but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai in the Valley! Do not let the exterior fool you, this place is a hidden gem. It is a family run establishment and Sean, the nephew of the owner, is always there to great you with a smile. Try the Tom Kha (coconut soup), the eggplant and tofu, the Pad Se-ew and any of their curries. They also have a lunch buffet during the week and on Sundays. My wife and I are not fans of buffets but this is not your regular buffet. It is the exact same quality as their regular menu, but you get to eat as much as you want and try different options. One last tip, their food is quite spicy, even at level 0. I don't suggest you go more than 2, 5 you will be crying."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time since new owners to go over a few years ago we didn't know they were new owners or we would've tried sooner but when I explain to the waitress that we were worried because I don't eat spicy at all and I was scared I wouldn't find anything on the buffet she went with me and showed me all the options and how spicy they were and it turned out absolutely awesome and I was thrilled to death with my food it was all very tasty and not spicy in the ones that she showed me my husband who like spicy he was thrilled to death with his which were all very spicy"}
{"text":"Was in the Scottsdale area for a few days and wanted some authentic Thai food. I grew up in Bangkok Thailand so I am very picky and I demand real Thai food. This place is the best of the best. I usually ask for the chef and make sure they are from Thailand. Sama \"Owner/Chef\" came out because we spoke a little Thai and asked for a special Thai dish. Unfortunately this dish need a lot of time preparing but after speaking with her we are convinced this will be real authentic Thai. Ordered a few dishes and let me tell you. It's perfect Thai. Everything we ordered was made exactly as you would have it in Bangkok.   Too bad I live in Philadelphia or I would be there every week."}
{"text":"We went with friends. None of the four of us were very knowledgeable on Thai cuisine. Our server was wonderful offered excellent choices and none of us were sorry with our choices.  Good food and good service very enjoyable for our first time here. Not much from the outside next to an Aamco parking lot but worth the trip here. Will return"}
{"text":"Sufficient for your Thai fix but it's no Sala Thai (32nd St.  just north of Shea Blvd.)  Went there for dinner, so I have not yet tried the lunch buffet. I do plan on giving it a try some time.  They charge for refills after the 1st soda refill, and after the 2nd tea refill. What? That shit costs them almost nothing, you're really going to charge for refills? Seems rather nitpicky and customer-unfriendly.  Decent decor, the food is OK. Spiciness is from 1 to 5 and 3 was a decent amount of heat. I could not have done 4 and 5 must be suicidal. They will bring out a tray of four hot spices if you want to add a dab.  All in all it's... A-OK but I live closer to Sala Thai and I would not drive the extra distance to go here."}
{"text":"Walked in at 7:15 pm on a Friday as a party of two. We were seated promptly, but that was the last human contact. Three parties were seated and had drink and food orders taken while we sat.   Wasn't able to catch anyone's eye and our departure didn't stimulate any comment.  I was really disappointed, it looks like it might be good. The place wasn't overly busy, no line or anything. Not really sure what's going on...."}
{"text":"Excellent! The paennang curry with tofu and vegetables was the best we've had in a long time. The atmosphere is clean but still cozy and the decor is nice as well. One of the owners was our server. He was really helpful, friendly, and informative. We also had a spicy drunken noodle dish, which had lots of fresh vegetables - also really good. The portions were large. We both took home leftovers."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall kind of place with the most delicious lunch buffet I can remember eating. I hate lukewarm buffets, I hate buffets in general, but this one is definitely an exception. The assortment, taste, and price make this one of my favorite little Thai places. The spicy basil chicken and the panang curry were a few of my favs. Highly recommend this little gem of a spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai Buffett in town!, great choices,  great people, great atmosphere! And great food! We will come once a month."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they don't allow byob anymore and still waiting for their liquor license.  We recently tried their calamari pretty darn good"}
{"text":"There is something going on with this restaurant that I am not sure it will eventually survive. We have been here numerous times and the food is excellent but the staffing problem is bad enough that I don't think we are going to go back now. Last night we attempted to go in at six and were told it would be a 40 minute wait before they could even take our order because they had a lot of to go orders and those came first. Talk about poor customer service! I see on here that this happens quite a lot so they may want to look into getting some staff that care about customer service because the ones they have there right now could care less. We ended up at Sala Thai on 32nd and noted that a couple of people that had gone in after us and left ended up here too."}
{"text":"We've been here for the lunch buffet and it's pretty good food. The coconut soup and wantons are worth the price alone, but the rest of the buffet is pretty amazing. My only issue is the service. They're understaffed, and it shows during the lunch rush. I've had to get up and get my own water on more than one occasion, and ask repeatedly for something I've ordered from the menu. There's been a few times I've gone and they have had difficulty restocking their foods. The owner can have a bit of an attitude sometimes. The food is excellent, but the service is just meh."}
{"text":"5 stars for the MOSCATO 5 stars for the papaya salad 5 stars for the Pad Thai 5 stars for the Pad Woon Sen Service = 2 thumbs up!!!  I   Reign of Thai!!!! (\",)"}
{"text":"I'm use to eating at other Thai restaurants in Scottsdale and Tempe, this is a true hidden treasure.  Outstanding food and service.  This is one of my top five in the world now"}
{"text":"Has a really great list of vegetarian options...food was very delicious .. Rightly spiced ... We ordered a Panang curry at a spice level of 2 and it was great... The only thing lacking was prompt service ... They were understaffed or running slower in the kitchen ... In any case the great food made up for it .."}
{"text":"Just visited this excellent establishment, the food was delicious. My husband and I tried the fried rice, pad thai, teriyaki beef and egg rolls. I enjoyed every extremely hot bite of it. The advice of others is accurate, easy on the spice scale. I had a 2 and oiy.  The place is clean and has a neat little paint job on the outside. Don't blink or you might miss it. I highly recommend you give er a try."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, I want to love this place.  Only ordered take- out twice, cute interior, nice people up front.  I've ordered pad thai twice before. 1st time, a 3 on scale of 5 for spicy= WAY TOO SPICY. 2nd time, a 2 scale of 5 for spicy= STILL WAY TOO SPICY.  How can I not get a medium, light spice in my pad thai??? When it is too spicy, it is literally almost inedible. I have another thai place I go to often and I will be going there from now on. They know what a 3 on a scale of 5 for spicy is. I'd rather not have my mouth burn off, thanks"}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday for lunch with my coworkers (about 13 of us) and we were very impressed with their buffet selection. The restaurant isn't very big, but they were able to accommodate large and small parties to the point where there weren't anymore tables left! Very good sign  all I can say is excellent service and food! They continuously had food coming out and kept apologizing for the delay even though there wasn't really one at all. Everyone that worked there was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. We all enjoyed the food, no complaints. Thai tea was authentic and delicious as well. I decided after my first taste that this place will be one of my options for lunch or dinner from now on! Thank you for a great lunch"}
{"text":"If you like your Thai like your summers....hot!!!! Then this is the place for you! They make their food delicious and spicy!!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back as a loyal patron to the original owner who sold the restaurant and recipes to the current owner. The soup is great! Food is pretty good. I dislike how the buffet only has chicken dishes. Literally 10 very different Thai dishes with only chicken. Really annoying. Service is just fair. Now I know the original owner has reopened in central Phoenix, I will no longer be going here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Soup is one of the best Thai coconut tum yum I've ever had. Their noon buffet is to die for. They make small batches so it is always fresh. You may have to wait between batches but WELL worth the wait! Great variety and good heat level A spice tray is available if you care to ramp it up. I can't hardly eat anywhere else in the Phoenix area with out thinking \"We should of gone to Reign of Thai.\" The staff and the chefs ROCK!"}
{"text":"We are from Sedona and once a month we go down to Phoenix to spend the day.  We looked up this restaurant online and we like the reviews we saw. We tried out for ourselves and we absolutely loved this place.  Thai food is one of my favorites and I have been too many Thai restaurants before in Chicago,  Southern California and Sedona, but I must say that Reign of thai is the best one among them.  We arrived right when they started their buffet , 11:30am, and the place was sort of empty. By the time we left, the place was packed.  We tried the pad tai, chicken Panang, spicy basil chicken, the vegetable rolls and the coconut soup and everything tasted so good.  We also ordered fresh shrimp rolls because my wife loves them.  The staff is super friendly and professional.  The place is very clean, and well organized. I recommend this place to anyone that loves Thai food.  My wife and I are definitely coming back here... Well done Reign of Thai !!!"}
{"text":"We were there for the lunch buffet and would recommend it to anyone that loves Thai. There was a great variety of dishes and the flavors were incredible. There were several dishes we tried and enjoyed them all. The spicy basil chicken was excellent as well as the coconut soup and all of the curries, panang, mussaman, red, yellow and green. It was a great meal and we will be back."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  My parents don't tend to get too adventurous with their food selection. But I went there with my parents, husband, and sister and we all LOVED it. We all ordered different dishes and everything was awesome!! I doubt there is anything on the menu that isn't good. I would recommend not going too high on the spice level. Their dishes seem to spicier than other restaurant's spicy dishes."}
{"text":"The area the place is in seems a bit sketchy. Do NOT get the \"fresh rolls\". They are disgusting. It's crappy salad mix with cilantro and mint and shrimp in a rice paper roll. It's literally the worst \"roll\" I've ever eaten in my life.   Service was good though. It seems like a little family owned place.   The shrimp pad Thai was super good. It wasn't too dry or overly saucy. We had it at spice level \"2\" which had a great kick to it. I love spicy food, and it gave me the sniffles from the spice. But it was really good and I would definitely eat here again. I gave them 4 stars bc service was good and I loved the pad Thai. Loved it. Just don't get the \"fresh roll\"."}
{"text":"1PM on Sunday.  Absolutely no employee interaction with customers waiting in line.  They're either massively understaffed or just don't care.  We waited a good ten minutes and then just left as we saw the employees weren't clearing tables after customers left.  What irritated me the most was that there's a massive bar that takes up the entire length of the restaurant that had zero people seating at it.  They literally could have instantly seated the eight people waiting instantly, but are choosing to force customers to wait instead.  Not a well-run business."}
{"text":"The food here is always great. Reign of Thai has been our go to to Thai restaurant in the valley. My friends and I already tried all the food in their menu and everything was flavorful. In terms of the service, expect for some delays during a busy night but other than that my experienced has been pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the pineapple fried rice and have never been disappointed. It's run by a family and some friends and they have always been friendly. I make sure to stop by multiple times whenever I'm in town from college!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place made me doubt my decision to try this place out. It is just not in an area where I would expect a food joint, but I committed and went inside.   This place has the typical kitsch decor, lit with IKEA lantern style lamps. I am not complaining, I am merely saying that these people focus on what works and not pretending to be something they are not.   I had a curry and I ordered to a 3  (out of 5) in spiciness because I didn't feel like sweating this evening, but boy was I mistaken. A 3 was about what I could handle.. while downing ice water and panting like a dog. But it was good. Oh, it was really good. Having been to Thailand, I must say that I have eaten food there that was very similar to what I had here. I was impressed and I will return to this location.   The rest of my party also enjoyed their food a great deal. It does help that it is a family establishment, that runs a skeleton crew. Their product is more the food than the experience, but the experience is the food.   After eating I was heading to my concert, but I really needed a nap.   Tips. * Yes, this is the place. Go inside.  * Remember that if you ask for spicy, you will get it.  #PoundSign"}
{"text":"WOW such a great place for Thai food!  Wonderful. Friend suggested we come here and was definitely not disappointed. My friends and I shared a couple of dishes, and all were wonderful. Would definitely recommend their pad thai -- one of the best I've had to date. Green curry was also great as well!  Parking can be a little difficult because it is in such a small plaza."}
{"text":"Happily surprised by the taste and quality of the buffet!! Several dishes to choose from and everyone I ate was delicious!  The coconut chicken soup was one of the best Thai soups that I have had!!   I really like you can increase the level of spiciness to your dish with the assortment of chili available, because I like mine HOT and my boyfriend doesn't. :)  The staff was very friendly as well.   We will definitely return to Reign of Thai!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic Thai cuisine. On first visit, go with hot #2. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, courteous and mostly attentive staff who really know their product and it's quality. We've been back several times and haven't been disappointed. Made to order, family recipe Thai with a lovely array of spices to kick your dish up 1-10 notches in heat and flavor. Our favorites are the Spicy Basil Noodle, Pad See-Ew, Spicy Eggplant (wow, it one is awesome) and the pineapple fried rice dish. We attempted to order dessert at one visit, and they were out of an ingredient that made up their fried banana & coconut iced cream dish- so we passed. We'll try during our next visit"}
{"text":"Service good and friendly.   Went for lunch and had buffet.   Best Thai food I have had in the valley.   Eggs rolls perfect.   5 different curry dishes to try.   Everything good at good price."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Arizona. Everything that my husband and I have tried have been excellent. The new owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"I can not begin to explain how great this place is!!! I love the yellow curry, it's a must try!!! The lunch buffet is also a must, such a great deal with lots of great choices! I seriously try to come here once a week!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I have gone to this little family own restaurant for quite while, but I have kept feeling guilty not to write a review here for supporting it. We found this nice restaurant on Yelp also. The service is always great because all the servers are helping each other on every table. Sometimes the server A may come to ask you if you need more drinks or anything else. No matter you say yes or no. After the server A left, the server B or C might come over to ask you the same questions again. This is not because the servers aren't communicating with each other, this is showing each of them isn't just care about his or her own table and tips! This what we called the team work to make the service better than others. Let's talk about the food. I only have tried a few dishes so far because I stick with the same certain dishes when I like them. The dish that I usually order is the fresh rolls with shrimp and tofu for appetizer and the fresh ginger with chicken for main entree. They are both yummy! The price isn't too bad at all.  The only thing that we need to get use to is they close in the afternoon for few hours and reopen at 5PM. If you would like to check out their food. You will need to check on their opening hours first."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've found in Phoenix. Only bad thing is it's basically a bar with a bunch of tables. Good food though."}
{"text":"Coconut soup is excellent. Curries are generous and delicious. Everything I have ordered has been outstanding. A #1 or #2 is hot enough for me to taste what I ordered. The servers and staff are friendly and helpful. I"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix!!! Have different spice degree, be careful which one you order. Prices very reasonable, variety menu. Pad Thai, chicken teriyaki  my two favorites, the best. Can get busy on weekends, dine in early or order take out, just as great!!!"}
{"text":"If you love Thai food, you gotta check this place out on Sunday for the buffet! Great value & the food is sooo good! I hate to post this because I don't want to have to wait for a table when all of you try it..haha...but this place deserves a lot of business! The staff is friendly & so welcoming!"}
{"text":"Came here for some curry, ended up getting the lunch buffet. Let me tell ya, you get your money's worth, even if you only eat one plate. The crispy egg rolls, basil chicken ,coconut soup, noodle dieshes, several curry dishes, along with the Thai fry rice and fried wontons...it was amazing.so glad to see a Thai restaurant that still offers a lunch buffet.i will be back"}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good Thai food, this is the answer .. Love discovering hole in the wall places!! Here's what we tried: fish cakes, tom ka soup, Thai basil chicken, pad thai, pad see eww.  First trip and we are hooked! Already planning on coming back to try their buffet on Sunday. 18 delicious choices..wow! Best of all, the owner and staff are simply amazing people."}
{"text":"Great meal, really charming place. Staff was helpful and friendly, and talked me down from ordering a five-star-heat dish. That was definitely for the best. I decided on a four-star drunken noodle and it was HOT. Very tasty meal, everything was fresh, well cooked, and definitely spicy. Waitstaff was attentive, never letting my glass go empty, and checked in frequently to see if I needed anything else.   If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely stop by. I'd love to try a few more items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious, i took my whole family there and it was the best experience.  Friendly service, and a great menu that you can customize.  I'm lucky to have the honor of living right next to it, so I go there all the time.  I wish there were more around town!!"}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for quite some time and finally decided to stop for lunch as I have never been to a Thai Buffet before. I'm usually the guy that orders off the menu and asks for \"Thai Hot\" which is usually followed by \"Thai Hot?\" then my reply is \"Yes, just as you would eat it\" with disbelief on the servers part as my order heads back to the kitchen.  However, this being a lunch buffet, it's obvious to say the spice needs to be palatable for most diners in the establishment. The atmosphere was nice and staff very attentive, just maybe a bit lacking in clearing the plates from the table, but otherwise no issues.   I tried a few different items from the buffet, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry Chicken, Spicy Chicken and Green beans, Spring Roll, and Coconut Chicken Soup. All the dishes were flavorful and had a slight kick to them. I'm sure you could as for extra spice on the side if you needed more, but everything was satisfactory.  I'd recommend it for a good lunch and I will be back to order off the menu at a later date."}
{"text":"So delicious!!!! The food was authentic me the service was fantastic!!!! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Best thai food around (and i looked). They are spicier than most but that's a good thing. Their food is bursting with flavor! I haven't tried anything i don't like on their menu. I've had their coconut soup, pad thai, rad nah, crab puffs & egg rolls. Customer service is amazing, everyone is down to earth."}
{"text":"Omg, so good! The Tom Kha Gah was so flavorful and creamy! The staff is friendly. They do close from 3-5 to get ready for dinner BUT they do not turn away people! The Pad Thai is AMAZING! There is a difference in white man spicy  and Thai spicy. The #5 spice is very spicy! It is, what I call, Thai spicy. It is good! If you can't handle spicy then hey the #1. A great little hole in the wall restaurant, which in my opinion, are the BEST! Don't pass up this place! You are missing a great little gem!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go to this \"secret\" restaurant for \"Friday Thaiday\".  The owners are always friendly, laughing, and welcoming.  The entire family helps out.  The food is delicious...you choose your spice levels for any dish.  The Rad Na (spelling?) noodles, the red or yellow curry, and the coconut soup are outstanding.  5 stars!  You can skip the wontons and the Thai toast appetizers.  We now laugh with the servers about it, but the only negative is that the food takes FOREVER to be served.  It comes out one dish at a time, so if you are with a big group, it is a wonderfully slow dinner.  The soup may be the last dish to appear or the first...you never know.  The inside of this restaurant is unexpected.  Cute and clean.  Bring your own wine or beer and there is no corkage fee.  They will bring you a big ice bucket, corkscrew, whatever you need.  Come when you are not in a hurry.  Come and enjoy this delicious, authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"This was my fiance's and my favorite Thai place. We used to order here all the time and dine in when we lived in the area. We have since moved about 20 minutes away and the last two times we came to order take out the food was so unbelievably spicy that we weren't able to eat it. It's beyond frustrating when a place you've eaten at for over a year suddenly makes a level 1 dish so spicy that it ends up in the trash can. We've wasted over $100 in two trips at this point and I can't justify trying it again. So frustrating. I just don't see what the point in making the lowest spice level on the scale something that is inedible to somebody who can tolerate a little heat."}
{"text":"Something went wrong today.  And when I say, \"Meh. I've experienced Better,\" for my rating, I'm comparing what I had today with what I have had in the past. A lunch buffet that normally scores an A++ served up a C- today. The buffet tables, which are normally well-tended, seemed to be getting ignored since most of our fellow diners were ordering from the menu instead of having the buffet lunch. The made-to-order dishes that the kitchen was turning out looked AMAZING while I was searching various chicken curry dishes on the buffet for CHICKEN.  I'm hoping they were just having a bad day...."}
{"text":"On vacation with four hungry teens. All agreed to Thai. This was within short distance from hotel and ranked well on yelp. It didn't disappoint. The Thom ka gai (coconut soup w chicken) was outstanding with lots of flavor. Everyone asked for more until the pot was empty. Curries were equally tasty. They take your \"hot\" seriously with a 3 out of 5 being fairly generous on the hot.  Thai steak was a T-bone an Inch thick. Pad Thai and chow mein were huge. You could order family Ste a few dishes for 6 and still have leftovers. Highly recommended  this restaurant for its quaintness (hole in the wall) and the owner's attention to service. A wonderful family restaurant run by a family."}
{"text":"While we were seated immediately and served water, we weren't given a menu or even asked for drinks. After that, no other checking in. I guess they assumed we were eating the buffet but since we aren't regulars, we wanted to know choices. Service was very sketchy throughout the entire meal. The food was sub-par. The chicken fried rice had very little flavor and, as another reviewer pointed out, the Pad Thai as well. The buffet had curry and chicken. Good luck finding any beef or any other flavor profile. The coconut chicken soup was just ok. I would not return. This is my first Yelp review which is a testament to how much I didn't care for this place."}
{"text":"This is a small unassuming restaurant from the outside that packs a lot of goodness for a great price.  While Thai buffets are not as prevalent as before here in Arizona such as Pink Pepper, this one offers a lot of variety in entrees, soups, and condiments."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai resturant in the entire Valley. I used to live out in Mesa, and would literally drive all the way up here for dinner. Now, i live much closer so i get to enjoy their food more often. By far my favorite thing about this place is the authenticity and their spice levels. I have been to so many places that I have asked for 5/5 spicy and it wasnt anything to rave about. Here, you better be careful because their spice isnt messing around I can barely get a 2/5 here. I love it though!"}
{"text":"This is THE most legit thai food in AZ.  I have been to all the more well known spots and this straight up blows them away.  They have amazing curries here and the variety of options is nuts.  We have gone several times (6-7) and each time it was on point.  The buffet is really fantastic which I believe is on the weekends (maybe Sunday only) not sure, but totally worth it.    Definitely check this joint out!"}
{"text":"Today we ordered beef jerky ,spicy basil chicken, green curry beef and mango sticky rice for dessert, everything were very delicious  very good service too"}
{"text":"We are from out of the area,  and decided to have Thai food.   We found this place and it looked busy , so we went in.  Very clean,  staff very friendly and accommodating.   My beef with basil was great. The beef salad was interesting,  not a style that I have been exposed to at a dozen other Thai places. Spicy beef alongside coarsely cut cabbage.  Interesting choice,  would not get again.  My wife had teriyaki chicken.  It was decent,  fairly plain.   Good place to hang out, good place for take out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the valley. It's very quaint BUT they have a delicious buffet. All the food was very fresh and very reasonable. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just found this place.  Been driving by for 2 years and finally went in. Great food. We will definitely be back. Good prices but it was the quality of the food and the friendly staff that made this place a winner. Tom Kah soup was great.  Noodles and the eggplant dish were also first rate."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! Family owned & operated. Take your favorite bottle of wine with you as it's a terrific BYOB spot.  We ordered one entree & the ingredients were so fresh & vibrant. The broccoli & broccoli rabe was perfectly cooked & crunchy.  The bean sprouts were large, white & burst with flavor in your mouth.  The chicken plump & perfectly cooked.  They err on the side of hot in their recipes as we had a level 2 & it was a fairly hot flavor. We have both traveled to Thailand & thought we were tough but I caution to get 2 or lower.   We enjoyed our bottle of Chardonnay while we ate.  We enjoyed it so much that we ordered the same recipe to go! As a lighter dessert we got the coconut ice cream with fried bananas. Perfectly delightfully light & sized to share.   The ambience is delicately decorated with Thai artifacts & impeccably clean.  The bathroom was super clean, painted a cool silver & smelled of orchids.  The door to the kitchen was open & I peeked inside & it was clean & everything was in its proper place. I was very happy to see that.     My only question was the audio ambience. There were not many tables occupied & it felt a little desolate that music would fill the vacant space. I remember hearing a little but then it was off.   The only other concern was the clarity of the menu.  My date did all the ordering so I did not browse the menu but he said it was really confusing to the new customer.    We stayed a few hours & by that time there were a few more tables occupied. I was happy to see that.   I highly highly recommend this place.  How we learned about it was on a recommendations from a stranger on a Piestwa  Peak mountain hike.  Thank you kind stranger."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food. It seems that Thai is hard to find in Phoenix but this place gets it fairly well on the mark.   The heat levels range from 1-5 and for once, a place that understands how to rate heat. Some places you can order level 80 heat of 100 and it's not even on the register. (I've never understood that). Here, though, level 5 is \"Thai hot\". (Thank you for that). (Secretly, you can ask for more than level 5 heat, but be prepared!). Lol.   Establishment clean and staff feet friendly.  Food quality is good and portions are large."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My favorites are Tom Kha soup and the yellow curry. The lunch buffet is a great option reasonably priced and you can taste everything. The staff is very friendly, the only negative and is why I'm giving a four star is I prefer booth seating which they don't have. It used to be BYOB but now they serve alcohol.  Over all a great restaurant and one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The secret is out on the place.  Best Sunday brunch buffet around!  The variety of all Thai dishes is impressive."}
{"text":"the coconut soup was most excellent .. great small establishment here on corner of Cave Creek/Thunderbird Rd.  They have fresh (delish) food, friendly staff, and great prices (buffet) .. check this place out."}
{"text":"I seek spice and this place meets expectations! The level 5 spice is hot! If you like your Thai food spicy, this is your spot."}
{"text":"If you want to eat REAL AUTHENTIC THAI, this is your place. I have never been more impressed with a local Thai restaurant. The buffet is highly recommended since you are able to try all their different dishes. If you can't handle spicy, I would err on caution with the buffet dishes and order off the menu first. I love this place so much I am going to go there for lunch. My 2 year old has been eating here with me since she started eating solids... and I dined here throughout my pregnancy. It is soooo goooodddd. Highly recommended if you want thaiiiiiii. P.s. the new owners upped their game. My favorite Thai restaurant in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Beware the spice! I always order a 3 on the spicy scale everywhere I go, but I was only able to eat about half my meal because it was too spicy. A 3 is about what I'm used to a 5 being in other places. Other than that, the food was great! I got a vegetarian pad Thai that was so flavorful and had the perfect amount of peanut. Boyfriend got a curry, he loved it but again it was too spicy to eat it all. The presentation of the food was really nice. And the wait staff is quick and responsive (and attractive!) I'll definitely be going back... I'll just order a 2 in spiciness next time!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious, authentic Thai food with great service, this is the spot!  It's easy to accidentally pass up because from outside it looks very small, sharing a parking lot with an auto repair shop.  However, the inside is surprisingly spacious, with a cute atmosphere.  You can tell the owners put a lot of love and pride into it."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet review.  It's a place that I really wanted to like, but it just fell short.  I arrived at 1 PM during the weekday for the buffet.  What I noticed is that a lot of the curries there had thickened up after being out for so long.  It really changed the texture of the curry to something I couldn't get excited about.  I've seen the picture from others here and the curry I had that day just wasn't the same consistency.  The pad thai was a no-go.  After sitting out for so long the noodles had turned into a soggy mess.  It's just not a dish that you can eat an hour after making.  The food isn't bad, but with each bite I just kept wondering what it would be like as a fresh item ordered from the menu.  I'll probably give it another shot and order direct or arrive for the buffet right as they open.  I felt like I hadn't really gotten this restaurants \"best shot.\"  Nice open design, very friendly staff, nice mix of customers."}
{"text":"I think the guy who is was filling my glass was named Jonathan?  Young kid. He did an amazing job!  I would come back just because he was so great and made us laugh.   Great customer service!  Also the kitchen made my curry 5.5 spicy.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"Like the weekly Yelp, 'Been there, Thai'd That!'. The buffet lunch time and the food items consist of curries, soups, stir fry noodles and rice. And many more. I been dining here several times and I haven't been disappointed yet. The wait staff are friendly and have good customer service. If you like like Thai food this a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is the main reason I have come here in the past, as they have offered a good variety of well prepared dishes at a very good price. I have also come here for regular dinner, which in my experience was even better than the buffet; no surprise there, as that is the general trend in restaurants that offer lunch buffets. After a long hiatus from visiting this restaurant, I tried their  lunch buffets two more times and things have changed. The food is OK but not great, and the variety that was the big draw for me in the past was no longer there. The fried rice is still good, the pad thai (only one kind instead of two from my past visits) was on the bland side, and the remaining dishes were mostly just tofu and chicken - good proteins, definitely, but gone are the mussel and fish dishes that I had enjoyed in the past buffets. I would definitely come here again, but when I do, it will be for the regular (non-buffet) lunch or dinner. Service remains friendly and the buffet price is still good."}
{"text":"I couldn't think of anyone that could eat a level 5 spice here...except Chuck Norris. Or a flame thrower. Or Satan. Unless you are one of the three, caution on the level. Impeccable service, it is a bit slow but we live in such a fast pace world, enjoy it. Maybe ask about how your party's day was like?   Highly recommend Tom yum soup, great presentation and plentiful. The cashew chicken is incredible...we added pineapple to offset the spiciness, the sweet & hot is a nice mixture. The pad Thai, awesome.   We LOVE Thai, but was even warned at a spice 3. HOT, HOT, HOT! But so good. I mastered the art of eating as fast as I could before the pain set in. Anything above, don't forget your nunchucks."}
{"text":"This place has changed names twice in the last 2 years and i was curious about the new arrangement. I must say the decor is improved over the past, and the food, service and thai iced tea are all still excellent! Its still byob as well. Only bummer is no buffet on saturdays!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Good Asian food is hard to find in the Valley. Our neighbor recommended this place and it was everything she promised and more. Best soup I have ever had. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. There were six in our party and each of us ordered a different entree and shares. They were all excellent! Coconut soup was fabulous."}
{"text":"Love this place too much. Great authentic food. Mango sticky rice is to die for. I love that you can bring your own beer. This is my favorite place to take my family!!!"}
{"text":"Best EVER!!!! Highly recommend!  Heavenly soup!  Owner was very nice and informative!"}
{"text":"Loveeed the food!! Definitely hands down my favorite place now for Thai food. Service was great and the food delicious. Tried the Pad Thai and the Green curry both in spicy so if you like spicy they are actually pretty spicy but tastes delicious !!"}
{"text":"Nice relaxing beautifully decorated Thai place Food was great and tasty The two young servers were very kind  Happy I gave it a try"}
{"text":"It doesn't looks like much from the outside but this place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. Excellent service, amazing food and I always end up with leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I really like the food and they are happy to make it vegan. I just wish they would fix up the place. I feel like I'm walking through their storage closet just to enter the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our kids go to school in this area. So we always passed it and never knew how good this place is. The buffet small but the selection is good enough. Thumbs up for us."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 8 times and each time the food is the BOMB!!! Cashew or Garlic Chicken, but never hotter than a 3!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai restaurant I've been to. The food is beyond delicious (went to dinner--haven't had their lunch buffet), the presentation was beautiful and the service was beyond helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who likes Thai food.  It is small, quaint, and I love that you can bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Im going to give 4 stars and not 5 because each time I go the level of spice is not consistent.  If I want a 4 in spice level its really over a 5 and if i want a 2 its like a 4. However, that isn't consistent...sometimes a 2 is a 2. So when they are on they are on, otherwise its frustrating"}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a fancy place this is not it, but if you want to eat at what may be the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix, this is your place. Please do not pass up the flaming coconut soup; its to die for. Now, I like spicy and hot and a 2 heat level worked for me but maybe not for everyone. This place doesn't weaken spice levels. We also got the delicious, sweet chicken skews. For dinner, we got the Penang and beef basil. Everything was outstanding!!  We had enough food, too much, that we had another meal at home the next day. This is authentic Thai cooking at its very best!"}
{"text":"So this review might be a bias because my wife teaches the owners daughter but I am going to write it anyway. The food and service here were excellent. My wife does not like spicy food but I do. So we ordered everything at a 0 spicy and I add hot peppers as needed. We tried the wings, teriyaki chicken with fried rice and the pepper beef.  We enjoyed all of it. We will be back for sure. They are located in a weird area but don't let that fool you. Swing by and check this place out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. They know how to make things hot. I order a 2  on a 1 to 5 scale there.  Other Thai restaurants I order a #4.  The food comes out fast.   Great service.  Family owned with a lunch buffet too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Every dish my wife and I have tried here taste amazing! When you eat the food here you can totally tell the owner makes sure each dish is made perfect. The Thai tea is one of my favorite things to get her along with any of the dessert's. My wife and I really enjoy the egg rolls and teriyaki chicken. The food does take awhile to make but that is because it is made fresh to order with fresh ingredients. If you like Thai food this is the place in Phoenix to get great food!"}
{"text":"When I moved to North Phoenix, I mourned all of the restaurants I left behind in Tempe, but this Thai place makes up for it. It's some of the best Thai I've ever had. Each dish is flavorful and delicious, and I'm personally in love with the décor. Gold paint and glittery floors? Yes please! My parents live in Prescott and they'll purposely find reasons to come visit just to get that Thai food. And it's the only Thai buffet I've found, other than the Pink Pepper. I recommend the Rad Nah and panang curry. Warning though, they don't mess around when it comes to heat. At most Thai places I'll order a 3 level heat and have no problem, the 3 I got at RoT was so hot I could barely eat it (but eat it I did 'cause deliciousness, but my stomach and tongue were NOT happy and it took three meals to eat it all lol)  Def check them out, they're a true hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Should I share this hidden gem with you and run the risk of having to wait for a table the next time we visit? There will most definitely be a next time. I have driven by this place every day for years and for some reason we never stopped but tonight while we were on our way to another local Thai restaurant we decided to give it a shot and I am so glad we did.  The location and exterior are a little rough....it's on a busy corner next to AAMCO. Inside the place is quite charming. We were seated within moments by the owners son and he immediately took our drink orders. I went for the big fresh noodles with chicken and my husband a curry. Luckily they explained the spice level to us when ordering or I never would have survived my meal. My noodles had some serious heat at a 2 but they were delicious. We had ordered an appetizer (Thai toast) but it never showed. Ordinarily I would be seriously annoyed but there was so much food it they probably did us a favor. Despite the hiccup up of the missing appetizer the service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and always checking on us without invading our space.  Don't go here expecting to get in and out in a rush. They warn you everywhere that their kitchen is small so you will need to be patient. It is most definitely worth the wait, so sit back and relax and enjoy!  Two entrees and a soda was just under $30.00."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly service and food quality.  Cost is reasonable give you get plenty to eat.  Be sure to get a large glass of water with medium and above spice level as you will definitely need it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, with a pleasant friendly atmosphere. Service was a little slow, but the staff kept us informed, and were so friendly that it wasn't a problem. Felt like regulars even though it was our first visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a noodle dish at medium spice level which is something I normally do at any Thai restaurant.  The spice level was so high I couldn't taste the flavor of the food and enjoy it.  When I said something to the waiter, he laughed and said their medium is a 1 on a scale of 1-5.  Would've been nice to know before ordering.  If a 1 is medium spice level, then there must not be a mild option?!  Won't go here again.  Besides the lack of being able to taste my food, I waited a long time for a drink refill of iced tea which they do limit the number of refills for iced tea (silly and ridiculous)."}
{"text":"The minute you walk in you are transported to Thailand; the food is authentic and delicious. Spiciness ranges from 1-5; good luck getting past a 3! We've ordered several different soups and entrees and have been satisfied 100%.   If you're looking for authentic Thai food, Reign of Thai is a must!"}
{"text":"Nice food on the \"partial\" buffet, but without salads or desert fare. The beer was cold. There are other Thai restaurants in this zip code that are more complete at much lower prices. Not bad . . ."}
{"text":"The locality might scare off some people. But one finds diamonds in coal mines and gold in river dirt. Amazing food. Loved every bite of it. The pad thai was amazing. So was the sa-tay. Would definitely recommend to other people."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I Love spicy food, and their level 4 makes me sweat! The heat doesn't sacrifice flavor though. The staff remembers you if you come back more than once, and I've been there plenty!!! My husband and I have very sensitive stomachs, so we usually rate a place on how sick we get. This place gets 5 stars because we didn't get sick at all! From the Panang to the Teriyaki to the egg fried rice, this place is awesome! My mouth is watering just writing about it!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Thai food. Beware! Spice level 3 is VERY SPICY! Desserts are 'to die for.'"}
{"text":"My husband and I just got takeout from here. We will surly be back ASAP! We had the pineapple green curry with chicken and pad Thai (as well as crab puffs for my preggo craving) :) Everything we had was a spicy 1 and still had plenty of kick for me without being uncomfortable......and I like spicy! Glad we read the reviews and took it easy on the spicy. I can't wait to go back and try a buffet!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to Thai food, so I finally decided to give this place a try. I had the Pad Thai and it was easily the best I've ever had!  I would recommend this place to anyone and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Everything we had was excellent. They let you pick your level of spice, don't be a hero! 1-2 is plenty. 3-5 and even the spicy food people in our group had running noses and watery eyes."}
{"text":"First time here; went in on a Friday evening.  Parking lot is small and there was one spot left.  Restaurant was very busy, so we sat at the bar.  The sign by the front door said \"now serving beer and wine\", so if you were waiting for that addition, it has arrived.  We ordered the egg rolls, chicken satays, massaman curry, and garlic sauce.  I had 2 glasses of wine, and it was boxed wine, but this isn't a wine cafe so I'm not going to let that get me down.  Bottom line is this: service was excellent, and the food was the best Thai I've had in the valley to date.  I like my food spicy, and this place delivers.  (We ordered a hotness of 4, which is Thai hot).  The only flaw in the entire order of food was one of the larger potato pieces in the massman was undercooked.  But still, I cannot dock a star off the overall experience.  We will definitely be back.  Another positive I feel I should mention is that they have televisions... so now you can go on Sunday and catch some games while you eat :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food in the family that runs it is fantastic. They have a great lunch buffet that's worth every penny. If you have friends who say they don't go for time because they don't know what to order make sure you take him to reign of Thai for lunch it's fantastic and then your friends will get a large variety of things to try"}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Thai food, even on their buffet. I would know since I lived there for 30 years."}
{"text":"We come for the Buffett and never leave disappointed. The curries are awesome and everyone loves the coconut soup. You need this Thai food in your face. Trust me"}
{"text":"Rude staff... We were in the area and decided to stop by. There was still 20min to posted closing time but they refused to seat us since they do not want to be stuck cleaning after 3. They should change posted time to 2:30 since 3 pm is not correct. Would not recommend it to anyone due to bad customer services ."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here at least once a week unless I am out of town. The lunch buffet is delicious, tame enough that people who don't like spice can still enjoy it. Their spice level on menu is a little hotter than most Thai restaurants. The owners and staff work very hard here but they are always really nice."}
{"text":"The service, food, decor, and atmosphere were fantastic.  Food was beautifully presented in good portions with delicious flavor.  Had all you expect of a Thai restaurant as far as choices; I had shrimp spring rolls with coconut pb sauce, and shrimp satay...absolutely wonderful.  Satay had a maple flavor, which was amazing."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm a bit hesitant with \"buffet\" asian food.  The thing I like about it is that it's generally made to order, and right off the heat when it's served.  So seeing something on a buffet line in this situation makes me cautious.    Don't fret - had a great lunch here - much more food than I could have imagined and at a great price.  Lots of options, and well prepared.  It appears they do try to make it in smaller batches so it doesn't sit for a long time... due to that, you'll occasionally see an empty tray - but don't stress - another fresh batch will be out soon.  Service was great.  No complaints.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place during lunch for their buffet. Was disappointed with limited selection which was mostly chicken and vegetable dishes. Though everything I tried was great, I was hoping for more variety. I ended up speaking to one of the very nice servers and expressed my mediocre feelings, and he let me order off the menu without charging me for the one plate I tried from the buffet. I went for the panang curry with beef, and it was delish!  Their Thai iced tea was decent, too. Will try it again during dinner time perhaps with a group so I can try more things."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever eaten. You may not expect it, because of the location, but this place is so tasty. We got the pan naeng, coconut soup (tom kha) and the Pad Thai. Id have to say that the coconut soup and the pad Thai were the real winners. The pan naeng was good but a tiny bit soupier than I'm used too. The service was great and we ordered extra spicy food so she kept the water coming. Oh, the portions are pretty huge too! I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet has a good price and good food. It's a small location but that makes it quaint. The service was good and friendly. I would come back here again. Although not the best, the pad Thai was good and I've found it hard to find good pad Thai in the valley."}
{"text":"My stomach is very happy right now. Love the coconut chicken soup included in the buffet!  Also I'd like to mention that the tap water taste amazing.  I normally hate restaurant water but it actually tasted like high end bottled water."}
{"text":"So delicious! We had great service here and the food was quite amazing. I had the coconut curry soup and the lemongrass and ginger in it made for a very delicious and healing soup. I was having sinus issues when we went to eat here. My hubby loved his food as well and he is a picky one. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. Great meal with friendly and prompt service. Food was excellent and we especially enjoyed it now that we know to dial back the spiciness when we order. They're sure not afraid to turn up the heat here! This will be our first choice for Thai in the future."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant a few times with my wife and friends for dinner and have always had a very good experience. Tried the Sunday luncheon buffet and was not impressed at all. Sadly, anything with pasta (pad Thai and a wide noodle dish) was gummy and stuck together, not edible.   All other protein choices were primarily chicken dishes which all pretty much tasted the same. The mussels were good but again, overall, not much variety. There was a crowd so the food being served disappeared quickly.  Saw the server initially to take a drink order and never saw again. Had to walk over to the register to pay."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a nice atmosphere and friendly service. I got the yellow curry super spicy, and it was delicious. It was served very hot though, and it took a while to cool to a point where I could actually eat it. I also got the Thai tea, which was delicious - very similar to chai tea. I plan on returning to try the $10.99 lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"First time going tonight service was great,food was unbelievable, great atmosphere and we will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Awesome customer service family owned and they all are friendly and very attentive to their customers. First time here and I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the lunch buffet and it did not disappoint.  We came in on a Wednesday right when they opened and there were two fully stocked buffet tables of hot food.  Selection was good and there were more offerings than I had expected.  My favorite buffet items were the pad thai, string beans with chicken, green curry, and the veggie dish.    Service was fine for us but it was maybe not the most professional or organized.  When one of the waiters brought the wrong dish out to the table next to us, he seemed very flustered.  Instead of just apologizing for the mistake, he instead said it wasn't his fault but the fault of the person who took the order.  The people at that table didn't seem to mind, but I just thought it was a strange response by the waiter.  All in all the experience was very good.  As long as they still offer the buffet I will be back again since all-you-can-eat Thai food is such a rare find."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg rolls and the Pad Thai for takeout. When you order they tell you they run a little hotter than most places, and WOW, they weren't kidding. I usually get a 3 at other restaurants but I should have ordered a 1. The Pad Thai was pretty darn good but I wouldn't eat the egg rolls if they were free. Everyone was very chill and place was pretty clean.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! this is one of the most AWESOME buffett that I have been to and the only Thai one EVER IN MY LIFE!!!   Start with the size: deceptive of how big it is from the outside. I was thinking a small place but inside is a full bar and atleast 12-15 four person tables and 2 sets of 8 person tables.   The buffett: homemade taste and heartfilled energy that goes with it. 16 dishes to try from pad thai to currys( red green yellow) tofu diahes too. 2 soups today is coconut chicken with HUGE mushrooms killee flavor but not overpowering heat. The Tam Yum is amazing the base of that soup per my spouse is a sweet carrot tase with the Tam Yum flavor. She said it makes her feel like a little kid and makes her tummy feels good. The steamed rice is dry for me that is not my favorite but for my spouse loves it. I have to admit I like my rice soft and wet or sticky so this rice ia ok but like I said a personal preference.   Drinks: Thai ice tea rocks water at table before we even sat down from getting food off the buffett.  Coke and teas available but didn't get one.   For this level of food for 2 people 21.98,drinks 5.18 and tax 2.34 =29.50 is a great price.   Will be back for sure even if its not for the buffett cause the flavor is that good."}
{"text":"I use to not like Thai food, However I Believe in open-mindedness and willingness. I ate Thai food when i was little (Kindergarten) because I had a care taker that made the best Thai food ever. I could never find any that even cam close,  My husband has been talking about this place for a long time. I now get why...... I found that place that has the best Thai food since I was a little girl...and its  buffet. .whole cow yum yum yum!! The employees treated us as family omg loved it and I dont normally give all stars !!!"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant started out good, with the waiting staff being courteous & prompt.   Our appetizer was the fairly standard fried egg rolls with chicken & vegetables (mostly shredded cabbage). The rolls were hot off the deep fryer. Their taste was typical.   The pad see ew with beef was good but the cook forgot to add chilies to bring the spiciness to medium as ordered. The wait staff realized the mistake but did not offer to take the dish back to the kitchen for correction. Instead, he brought out the tray of chilies so we could add ourselves. Somewhat disappointing behavior in my mind. In spite of the lack of chilies, the pad see ew itself was pretty good.   When the dish of chicken & cashews was brought out, the waiter spilled the sauce on my wife's side of the table. Quite a bit of sauce too. Yes, the full dish was heavy for holding with one hand; he had a large bowl of rice in the other hand. But why did he use a tray & a stand?   The waiter did apologize for the spill. But he did not offer to clean it up. So my wife had to use her napkin to clean up this spill.   The chicken cashew dish was a bit spicer, to my taste, than ordered. Maybe the cook overcompensated for forgetting to add chilies to the previous dish. Again the dish itself was pretty good.   Even though the waiters did check up on us and offered to top off our glasses of water often, their lack of professionalism and the errors of cooking our dishes cause me to give them an overall rating of 3/5."}
{"text":"I love this place. We get take out almost twice a week. I love the red curry chicken and pad Thai. It is spicier than regular restaurants so be cautious... I started at a three and get a five now but I wouldn't start out with a spice level higher than three. Amazing staff... so friendly. We tell everyone to come here."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki was delicious! Level 2 spice is perfect! First Thai restaurant that's actually true to their spice level. Was not impressed by the Tom Yum soup but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the waiter that gave us heads up on the spicy food index. The Pad-Thai was good but missing the flavor along with the Pad-see-ew. The problem was with our twice fried or just old sitting chicken wings. After one bite I was looking for the server. He explained that they may have overcooked them then he went on to say \"well we're really busy now\" WTF! Get more help  So another server comes to our table and tries to explain the reasoning of overcooked wings and that the owner is only willing to deduct half the price since I bit into one.  Long story short and a few  our appetizer was removed from the bill."}
{"text":"Have driven by it several times and commented to myself \"you should try it one day.\" Well today was that day and boy am I kicking myself that it didn't try it sooner. The place was clean, quite and our server was fantastic. I had the chicken pad-see-yew and it was great. The chicken had a nice sear to it and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The dish had some spicy at a level 2 but it wasn't too spicy and it is great that you get to choose how spicy you want your food. My wife had the Mas-Sa-Mum curry which was the hit of the night. I ate more of her curry than I did of my noodles.  Our server, who I believe is one of the owners, encouraged us to come for one of the buffets to try an assortment of different dishes. She explained that the buffet consists of a large portion of the normal menu not a buffet menu. All in all a great dinning experience and will go back"}
{"text":"Wow!  Never been to Thailand but love Thai food. After trying more than a dozen Thai restaurants in the valley, I can say this is the best so far. Been there twice. Service is great. But the food is so flavorful!  Got the Pad Thai at three stars but was too hit for me so I will need to tone it down next time. I enjoyed the Tom Yum goong at three stars and also the Panang chicken and Massaman at the same spice level. Thanks to our friend  Sahra for suggesting this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I will be back frequently, best Thai food ever! If I closed my eyes and toke a bite I would think I died and went to Bangkok!!! The owner is really nice and very informative...there were degrees of spicy foods. Absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix! Love how legit spicy their scale is, and the staff is always super friendly. The lunch buffet is a great deal, but we love coming here even during days/times the buffet isn't happening. The coconut soup is my favorite, but every single dish we've had has been delicious down to the last bite."}
{"text":"I am super into Thai food and I'm always looking for a good place to try, I had bookmarked Reign of Thai a while ago and was super excited to try it this past week. Location seems a little obscure, but that's not an issue haha.  So it wasn't too busy when I first was seated but it picked up pretty quick right after and there was just one server working there. He was doing a great job keeping up with the crowd though! Was always on the move, but still provided us great service. I usually go for red curry with tofu but I ended up getting masaman curry with tofu. It was very tasty and I liked it! The onions in it were nice and sweet. Peanuts added a nice crunch too. I think I would've liked the red curry a little better though. My experience was good, but I felt bad because my boyfriend did not have the same. He enjoyed his food (coconut soup), but ended up feeling very sick from it for the rest of the night :(."}
{"text":"Been here several times now and can say it is our favorite Thai restaurant in town.  It's located in a small and tight location (blink and you'll miss it) with limited parking, but don't let that deter you.  Once inside you will experience a pleasant decor.  Friendly staff, great service and excellent Thai food. Their lunch buffet (Tues - Fri & Sunday.) offers a good selection of house dishes and soups. The dinner menu offers a large variety of traditional Thai dishes cooked to order with fresh ingredients and nice presentation. My favorites are the Papaya Salad appetizer, Red, Green or Mas-Sa-Mun curry's, and their wonderful noodles dishes; Pad-Thai, Pad-See-Yew & Spicy Noodles. If you like your food spicy a 2 or 3 on the Thai spice level will do for most. Any hotter should be eaten at your own risk!  We finish off our meal with a Fried Banana Ice Cream or the Coconut Ice Cream for dessert.  Beverages include Thai Ice tea, soda's a good selection of beer, wine and alcoholic beverages.  FYI, they are CLOSED on Mondays!!!"}

{"text":"Thai Buffet with friendly service.  Good place to eat when you don't know what to eat or just want to try variety of Thai food.  I tend to order the same food over and over again at Thai restaurant but since I wanted to try more different dishes, I came here to try.  I started with Thai tea, always good to have on standby just in case food is too hot. I went back three times to get different dishes and all were consistently good."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Thai food or like food with a spicy hot kick, you need to try Reign of Thai. First impressions when you walk through the door may be a bit off putting. The interior has a bit of an \"unfinished\" feel, but upon being seated at our table and having a look around it takes on a charm of its own. We started with Thai fish cakes that were flavorful with a nice cucumber salad on the side that added a welcome brightness. The food... A word of warning, specify your heat level, Thai food can get rediculously spicy hot! Our server asked us how hot we would like it and I'm a fan of a bit of brow sweat while not over powering heat, so I chose \"medium heat\" which amounts to a Thai heat level of level one! I had the Drunken Noodle with chicken and shrimp, no bell pepper. The flavor was spot on, absolutely wonderful. Four plump shrimp and a proper amount of chicken, making for a satisfying meal. l I almost had to take home leftovers, but it was so tasty I ended up eating it all with no room for dessert! (NOTE: I am compelled to mention an aside on meat portions of \"Asian style foods\" in general. I get tired of reading reviews that complain of not enough meat in their dishes. Sure, we love our 14+ ounce steaks, but where we eat meat as the main ingredient of a plate it is more of a garnish in Asian dishes due to costs and availability in other countries. Now back to the review!) My wife had the Spicy Green Bean with beef. Of course I had to have a taste, the aroma coming off the plate was alluring... Just a great flavored dish! We complimented our meals with a couple of Sapporo and I cannot wait to go back! The menu has something for everyone; vegetarian, fish, meat, rice, noodles... I want to try it all!"}
{"text":"Just do it!   It's amazing! I've never had one bad dish and the laxidasical service doesn't even matter (well, until your  mouth is on fire from #4hot curry) because it's so so good.   Also had the coconut soup, just do this too. So so Good.   If you don't come ure missing out.    P.s. my reviews are normally methodical and thought out....there's no need to think about this place....it's that good."}
{"text":"Ate for dinner - food was okay with very big portions.  For spicy level I normally order 4 or 5 at Thai restaurants, but we played it safe and did 2 since my wife prefers it more mild.  WARNING - the food was waaaay spicier than 2 and the wife couldn't eat more than a couple bites.  It even had me sweating a little - I made a comment to the waiter and he proudly told me they use fresh ground peppers and their 3 was a 5 at other places.  That's great and all - but a little up front warning would be nice since we did say we wanted to keep it mild.  For dishes, we had pad Thai and green pineapple curry.  Quality was good and the curry made for great leftovers.  Still, I felt the food overall was average and didn't come close to unseating Siam as my favorite Thai food in the valley - I suppose I'd give 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Best food ever! The FBI  is to DIE for. I have always had a great experience. The only thing I would caution is that their spice level is a little inconsistent. Love it spicy but the 4 can be uncomfortable sometimes. Also, try the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Good food. If you want a little bit of kick and not a scorched mouth i recommend a 2 on the spice scale."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant... Food was amazing and the service was very friendly and staff was very attentive to our food allergies.  I loved the variety of choices. On our table was a flier that read \"We are a little kitchen and cook with a big heart\", I absolutely agree!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here since I read on Yelp that they have buffet for lunch time. And because I was craving for Thai food so much lol. The restaurant located in Cave Creek, which is a little far from our house.   Food: They have many signatures dishes which is really good, but limited. They have tom kha soup, yellow curry, wonton that I recommend is a must try. However, the pad thai with me is a little bland.   Price: $11.99 I believe so. Overall, it's a reasonable price.  Service: Nice and friendly, no complaints since I'm a picky person with people's attitudes lol  We will most likely return since me and my husband really enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"Although we really enjoyed the food, the service was not good.  It was our 1st time going to this restaurant.  If a restaurant says they close at a certain time, shouldn't they let customers in & serve until that time?  Well, we were not even greeted & were just told, \"You have 30 minutes until we close\".  Our order was taken abruptly, our food came out fast & we were totally rushed.  Once our food was delivered, the server NEVER came back to see how our food was or to refill our waters & drinks.  During our meal, another set of customers were told the same thing as us as they got seated.  15 minutes before the restaurant closed, more customers came in & were told that they couldn't be seated because they closed in 15 minutes & they could only order take-out.  It's a shame that the service was not good considering there are so many competing restaurants & this establishment didn't value their customers.  And, because we had a bad 1st impression, we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was our first tine here and found the food very flavorful and authentic.  My wife is from south east Asia and she enjoyed her food also."}
{"text":"This is definitely a gem in Phoenix. It's been hard to find authentic Thai food and we were so glad to have bumped into this. Food is always fresh, and service is good.  They warn you about the spice levels which has been helpful to me and my colleagues.  They customized options for my Vegan requirements and left the fish sauce off the dish, which was nice of them.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"So I get this notice across Facebook that some of my friends want to go to the Sunday buffet here in about 2-1/2 hours. I really like Thai.   I had to call my help and tell her not to come in and went off to meet Monica, Rand and Norm.  What a lovely place to have lunch, or probably dinner too.  My favorite Thai dish is red curry with chicken and theirs is very good, with the heat level at medium which I like.  I tried several other dishes and liked every one.  The owners are super nice.  Keeping in mind this is a buffet, I know at least three of us tipped in the 18-25% range because of the quality of food and service and the value of the meal."}
{"text":"It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.  Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!  Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.  Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ordered take-out with my mom and sister. The workers were really friendly and offered us water as we waited for our food to be finished. The manager was very helpful and friendly as well. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Not the great Thai food I've had. We ordered chicken red curry spice level 2 and it felt like it was spice level 10. There was barely any chicken pieces and it was mostly veggies, pretty disappointing. Also, the rice to curry ratio was off and we did not have enough rice for the amount of curry we ordered. The place is a bit overpriced compared to other Thai locations. Fried rice is average."}
{"text":"It has a great selection of tasty dishes. Plenty of options. Wish the layout of the tables were a bit more \"logical\" for traffic. Also wish the buffet was a bit bigger, the food seems to be stuffed all together, causing a line to be formed as soon as there are a few hungry patrons. $11.99 for Sunday buffet (drink not included). I hope a server will ask me next time if I needed anything as no one ever stopped by to ask me if I wanted a soft drink. Also, later on I needed a napkin (spicy food), I had to walk up to bar to ask an employee for one. And at some point I needed a spoon and couldn't find any anywhere. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very unique and pleasant.  Food had great flavor and portions were very fair for price and quality.  Fried won tons were inconsistent in filling and soft drinks have no free refills for 2 dollars you should offer refills."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I get take out and it's always super hot and fresh! I love the red curry with chicken I've had other things on the menu as well and it is all top notch!"}
{"text":"We been here recently. The Beef jerky was awesome ordered Thai hot and SURE it is REAL thai hot!!! It is how we love it:) Choo Chee Fish was too watery and not enough flavor. We ordered sake off the drink menu, and it was very nice bottle, by it was a more expensive bottle than on the menu. It's okay to be out of stock, but just would like to know beforehand. Friendly service, Thai atmosphere is authentic but too busy stuff stacked up every where.  Enjoy it and want to try another dishes."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food here. It is one of the best Thai restaurants.... with an incredible buffet! Outside of the buffet is does take a long time to get the food due to a small kitchen but it really is the best in town. The only issue is that the service not good. We would go a lot more often if the staff was more attentive, available, and cared about the customers. They stand at the bar with other ...with their backs facing us as they chat. Not okay.  The owner and chef is very attentive and caring but we have not found another staff member that has allowed us to have a good experience. I think if that was fixed .... there would be lines waiting to get in for the incredible food! Despite the staff issue ....I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I come here for the lunch buffet and it is always fantastic. All staff are courteous and attentive. Love the coconut soup."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai food I have had in a long time and at a buffet no less! I tried their pad thai, panang curry, red curry, thai basil chicken, and flat noodles. The flat noodles and thai basil chicken were probably my favorite. The flat noodles were cooked perfectly and had a slight sweetness to them. The thai basil chicken had a kick that was awesome and went really well with plain rice.   The Panang Curry was deliciously peanut buttery and the red curry was pretty spicy but had a great amount of flavor as well.   Overall, given the price tag combined with the amount of choices provided at Reign of Thai it's a no brainer to 5 star this place.  I will definitely be back and with a bigger appetite so I can try even more of their selection."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. We went there a few times and always fresh and perfect. I had a silky and aromatic  Tom ka Gai soup with coconut milk and mushrooms and bamboo shots that brought more zesty flavors to the note of heart;)) I love Thai cuisine a lot!!:)))))"}
{"text":"I've had the killer lunch buffet here and decided to come here for dinner. Everything is homemade to order and is delicious. If you're a rookie with spice, order without any stars (goes up to 3). They grind their own hot chilis, so even if you like things \"hot,\" I'd still advise 1 star in regards to spice level. I love the pad see yew (flat noodles) and my boyfriend loves their curry. Curry is on the thick side, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great find! Our server Sean was very friendly and attentive. We ordered spicy basil with shrimp and massaman curry with pork. Both dishes were very good. Sean asked if we have been there before. Since it was our first time he explained that their food is spicier than others. I am so grateful he told us. I went with level one hot and it was perfect. I enjoy spice but I enjoy flavor even more. Since it's about a 40 minute ride for us I am wishing they were closer. I do find the Thai restaurants here are more pricey than back in Illinois. I sure miss Thai Smile back in IL."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. While a little disappointed there was no buffet on Saturdays we quickly discovered some of the most delicious Thai food we've eaten in a long time. The owner recommended the yellow curry and it was perfection!  The large scallops were melt in your mouth fresh which is  hard to accomplish in the desert. The pad see yew was equally tasty with just the right amount of heat at level 3. Thai tea was amazing to the last drop!  So happy to finally find a decent Thai restaurant so close to home. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, nothing fancy about inside but food is amazing authentic Thai. Will be returning here again."}
{"text":"The spice at Reign of Thai is like the summer heat in Arizona: hot as hell!! We came to visit for the first time and ordered chicken pad se yew and beef red curry: level 1. We originally said 3, but our waitress warned us that the food is really spicy so we went with 1.   The 1 was HOT!! If you do not have the tolerance for any spicy food, beware. The flavor is there but the spice was so much that I couldn't even really enjoy the food. The Thai tea was really good, but I only managed to eat a few bites of the food before I gave up. There was only one waitress to service the whole restaurant so the service was slow.   Our bill was average to other Thai restaurants. I left having a slight stomachache because my belly couldn't take how spicy the food was. If you're into spicy food, definitely come and check this place out. If not, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dinner and it does not disappoint.  All the choices we had we fantastic - fresh and flavorful.   The spice levels were perfect as some of us liked it hotter than others.  Our go to restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Whether you do the lunch buffet or order by plate, you'll love what you get. No matter what though, you must try the mango with sticky rice. It's perfect!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time we had the all you can eat. It was ok. (The reason I give it 4/5).   However their normal dinner service is amazing. The food is very tasty and the staff was very friendly. The food comes out very quick and has beautiful presentation.   All in all a great place to eat for dinner. Just avoid the buffet."}
{"text":"'Sorry it's a shit show tonight', the greeter said shortly after we were FINALLY acknowledged. That should have been our cue to leave. We walked in the door and waited for at least 3-5 mins before being acknowledged. The staff walked by us several times and didn't even take 15 seconds to say we will be right with you. Instead two of the staff talked amongst themselves about us waiting there and where they could sit us. It wasn't until after this awkward conversation that they actually said they would seat us in a minute. We were seated after about a 10-15 min wait which I think is acceptable.   We were brought water and they took our drink order. Drinks came out quickly but after that moment we didn't have anyone come to our table for at least 45 mins time. At this point we were out of drinks and water. We sat out of water for some time. After what I believed to be nearly an hour I got up to go ask if they had started our food yet or were cooking the rice grain-by-grain (jk). They were obviously having some issues because the counter/bar area was lined with bussed dishes. They said our food was about to come out in just 5 minutes so we decided to wait it out. Food did arrive within 5 mins, however it was not as promised by the sign on the table. The sign said it would be worth the wait, but I feel at least half the dishes left something to be desired. They completely forgot the potatoes in a curry (which was highly disappointing but I wasn't about to wait another hour for a potato to come out of that kitchen) and another dish had noodles that were stuck together like a 'noodle steak'. The flavors were alright, but having eaten at many Thai places it was NOT worth the experience we had. I've been to curry places that serve better tasting curries and you are in and out in 10 mins.   Overall, I could maybe look past the wait time if the food was better. I could also look past the food and the wait time combined if the staff was more professional and accommodating. You could obviously tell they were stressed and frazzled, but having some professionalism and trying to provide good customer service goes a long way.   Given this experience, we won't be back...plus there are plenty of other Thai places in Phoenix where we definitely don't have to wait 2 hours for food, especially when the curry is missing potatoes."}
{"text":"Best coconut soup! This is our go to local restaurant with food that is cooked when you order it and is always fresh. Service is great as well. For our entree we had Big Spicy Noodles with Beef. When you order you also request your spice level of  0-5. If you love Thai food this is your place!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.  Absolutely amazing food.  Great selection and flavorful.  Fair prices with friendly staff many of which are family members.  This place is great.  Be careful with the level of spice though.  They have a scale of 5.  I thought I was pretty tolerant and got a 3.  My eyes were watering, nose running, my mouth burned for the rest of the night.  Don't get me wrong, I loved it but I order a 2 now and just deal with the runny nose.  I have a few friends who pride themselves on their ability to handle hot spicy food.  I'll bring them here next and watch them cry.  Remember, just pop a little white rice in your mouth to absorb the heat.  Or a nice cold Thai Tea will do the trick.  Bet I won't tell my friends that.  It'll be great..."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. It doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you... it's legit. Favorites include all of their curries, specifically masaman curry & yellow curry, and beef padseew (sp?) but everything I have tried has been delicious. Don't miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch on a Sunday. They had a buffet. We were sat down and given two waters. That was it. The waiter didn't address us, talk to us or offer anything. We sat at the table waiting for him to come back but instead he was busy socializing with the girl behind the bar. We wanted a menu and not the buffet. I finally got tired of waiting and walked up and disrupted their conversation to ask for menu where the waiter then told me that we could order from the menu but he wasn't sure when the food might come out. Looking around I could see that other people had ordered from the menu. We gave in and ate the food at the buffet which was was lack luster at best. We will not return to this place, the service was terrible and the food at the buffet wasn't good. We will stick to Tom Yum, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my brother. The service is always top notch. They greet you as soon as you walk in the door. I usually get the same thing everytime, but food is good. Only drawback for me is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been looking all over for a great Thai restaurant and having had some of the best Thai of my life in Seattle for almost 20 years was pleasantly surprised to find this here in Phoenix. I will definitely be back after having had a wonderful lunch buffet today. Thank you so much it's unfortunate it's so far away from my home but I will definitely make the trip at least once or twice a month on my way home"}
{"text":"Holy awesome!! Drive by this place twice a day to and from work and never noticed it! Did a Google for Thai and found it and some good reviews. This is by FAR the BEST Thai I have EVER had!! Staff is super friendly and multiple checked on us to make sure we were okay and that we had enough water. Cause you'll need it!! Very spicy. Did a level 1 and it was almost too much and I love spicy food!! The Tom yum lemongrass was the best I've ever had anywhere and the Spicy Noodles w/basil were excellent! Food takes a while because the kitchen is small but it is worth the wait! Can't say enough. Will be back at least weekly! Very reasonably priced and very good portions. LOVE it!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot. Flavors are on point and the quality is great. I'm addicted to the Tom Kha, especially in the winter.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here on a couple occasions. As other have stated you will want to get your food one notch down on the spice level. First time I ate here I was sweating just getting through the pad Thai"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I can say food is consistently delicious, perhaps the best Thai food in Phoenix. I love their drunken noodles with shrimp and scallops, so delicious. Their food is very, very spicy, so I always go for a spice level 1 (on a scale of 1-5), and it's sufficiently spicy for my taste."}
{"text":"Omg! This food was so delicious. They rate their  spiciness on a scale of 1-10. 3 is like a five at any other restaurant. Anything that has spice you can adjust to your taste. It was amazing! Best Thai food yet."}
{"text":"I liked this place. The food was pretty good.  They get the championship belt for menus. Lots of clear pictures of all (most?) of the dishes.  If you are a noob, point and pick.  I had massaman beef #2 spicy. I had Thom Kha Gai (chicken) #2 spicy.  For dessert, I had mango sticky rice.   I was warned by the server/waitress that they tended to lean spicier than most places and she was absolutely correct. The #2 was between medium and hot at most places I've been to. (It was hotter than most mediums).   The massaman beef was great, it had a nice creamy curry. Large chunks of potatoes. Flap style beef. If they used the chunk style beef like they do at my favorite place, I would probably just eat at Reign of Thai a lot more. But they don't, so I will still go to my #1 spot. And Reign of Thai will be my #2.   The Thom Kha was delicious. also creamy. No BS tomatoes or other garbage. I like it simple.  Probably better here than at my #1.  The mango sticky rice was a fail. The rice tasted weird. The mango wasn't delicious.  The food was really good, so the dessert it is what it is, I'll order something different next time.   Folks mention sweetness in some other reviews. I could for sure see the sweetness, but dude it wasn't like kool-aid or anything. Just enough to note. Not really enough to be aggro about. Plus the food was so spicy that the sweetness was a welcome distraction.   The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and what looked to be like a bar set up.  I suppose it would be a nice hangout spot if you were into that sort of thing.   I'd recommend this place if you are around it. I have a feeling that it would be hard to find a better place in the vicinity. I still have my favorite, but Reign of Thai is a lot closer and in a nicer location, so I look forward to coming back and trying their different dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem, even though it's in the middle of nowhere Phoenix.  Great family owned service, tasty spices in every dish, very cute/quaint setting and affordable menus.  Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants we've tried in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here Saturday night.  We walked in about 20 minutes before closing time.  The server was un phased and was more than welcoming.  The service was spot on the entire time.   The food was just stupid good.  I think this is one of the best Thai places I have ever eaten at.  The coconut soup is a must."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix - hands down! I don't think I have ever had Pad Thai that good before. Even better, they have plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you are anywhere near North Phoenix, check this place out!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I have never had a single complaint and we have been here a countless number of times.   The staff is friendly and professional. They are always welcoming and provide awesome service. They really take pride in their work and are a big reason why we will keep coming back.  Their food is phenomenal! Fresh ingredients, large portions, distinct and flavorful sauces, and SPICE. We always ask for our food to be \"thai hot\" and most places hardly ever give us anything hotter than a 2 or 3. Reign of thai gives you exactly what you ask for, every time. If you can't handle spicy food don't ask for anything higher than a 1 or 2 here.   During their lunch hours they do a buffet. This allowed us to try a variety of the different dishes they have to offer, including their spicy eggplant dish which has become a personal favorite of mine. Another great thing about the buffet is they allow you to take it to-go by charging by the pound. Try not to go too late (right before they close for the afternoon). They are sometimes out of certain dishes by this point, which is to be expected.   We've ordered food to-go here several times as well. We're never left waiting very long for the food to be cooked and it comes out just the way we ordered it each time.  If you are ever looking for a place to eat great thai food in Phoenix don't miss the opportunity to try Reign of Thai. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Haven't had Thai food in a very, very long time and i have to say i was pleasnatly surprised. Looks a little sketch on the outside, but don't let that little building in Phoenix fool you because its nice and clean inside. Had the lunch buffet and it was phenomenal. A good mixture of noodle and rice dishes as well as chicken, beef, tofu, veggie dishes. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonable prices, killer food. Very glad we stopped in and tried this place. Everything was delicious. My only complaint personally was a severely limited beer menu. Reign of Thai gets a regular spot in the rotation now. An easy recommendation."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing decor. We will be back!!! The noodle veggie soup was similar to Phu but better!! Boyfriend had the buffet and was able to try a variety of foods and he was impressed. He's been to Thailand and he loves this place. Good brick walls are a cool touch."}
{"text":"Sometimes a little too hot for my own taste, but this very tiny place really tries.  Good flavor for everything at their buffet with great soups for sure. Pad Thai was sub-par to me, but the chicken with pineapple curry was really good and filling.I did try some ginger chicken but way too hot, and I did keep choking on the lemongrass soup with the red peppers floating in it. The food, tho, is clean and plentiful--just a little hotter than this American taste can handle often. One negative is that there is no dessert at all on the buffet which surprised me, since I don't think I have ever been to a buffet with no offering for dessert.  Something would have been nice. One caveat:  Went on a hot Summer day for about 1.5 hours, and their electricity (lights, fans, etc.) went out about 8 times--but immediately went on again.  They must have someone standing there and flipping the switch at the electric box all the time. This is a good Thai place, tho, and if you like your hot at a 3-5 level you will just love this place. Unfortunately, I don't like it that hot."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Thai food all over the world, and this one ranks right above some of the worst I've ever eaten.  I wanted to try the buffet, so I went on a Sunday right after they opened. Typical Thai  \"most popular\" entrees are offered under heat lamps, like you'd expect, along with two soups, vegetable egg rolls and WonTons wrapped chicken/pork.  The Pad Thai was a disaster, tasting of dried red curry powder and ketchup (ever wonder where the sweetness comes from?), and the Panang Curry was a thick, strangely flavored, heavily red-curry influenced mess with a seemingly total absence of creamy coconut milk.  Some of the other noodle dishes were passable, fried rice was OK and (strangely) the won-tons were the best and freshest thing I had there.  Staff was very nice, and it was busy. I hope for the sake of everyone working there that this was an off-day, otherwise I cannot fathom why this buffet commands such a high rating."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! The flavor is way more mature than the other Thai places I've been to. Their heat scale is 1-5 and they are NOT joking when they say they are on the spicier side. We ordered the noodle soup with a heat scale of two and it had us sweating!! So good! And their fried rice is out of this world. I hear they have a buffet during the week which I havent been to yet but we will have to make a lunch trip for That! Oh and their green tea is awesome, by the way!! This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Great food!! And love the decor. Got the soup, curry, and coconut ice cream. One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to! Watch out for the spice level!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the soups. Out of this world delicious. The Silver Noodle and Tom Kha are spectacular. Deeply flavorful. Hands down some of the best soups I've had in a long time. Clearly I can't recommend Reign of Thai's soups more.   On to the noodles. The Pad Thai is always a good point of comparison, and sadly, Reign of Thai's Pad Thai was a major swing and a miss. It was waaaay too sweet, lacked any kind of complex flavor, and even my kid said it was gross and wouldn't eat it. Yuck.   The Pad See Ew was ok, but nothing special. It was edible, at least.   Larb is one of our very favorite dishes and sadly, this white girl makes a far better larb in her own kitchen. It majorly lacked one of the signature flavors of larb: toasted rice powder. It's like they skimped on it. Not cool.   They also really skimped on the service. Awful. Just awful. Aside from actually carrying our dishes to our table, there was literally no service. He never checked on us which made it difficult to ask where our missing dish was. It also left us very thirsty.  All in all, Reign of Thai offered a good soup experience and I'd come back for those. But only those. Otherwise, it's not worth the trip if you're looking for an authentic, high quality Thai meal."}
{"text":"Just go here. The food is great. Their buffet is out of sight. People line up to go here just before opening.   I live on the other side of town now, but I've been thinking about this place lately! I've got to make a trip back."}
{"text":"Awesome service and the Pad See Ew is the best that I've tasted in the area. The prices are fordable and they have a buffet but I've never actually tried that. A great locally-owned spot with delicious food. Very clean"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. There was a bit of a wait for the food, but well worth it. I got the eggplant entree with tofu. The vegetables were bright, crisp and crunchy. The meal had a perfect amount of spice - I picked 3 out of 5 on the spice gauge. Very tasty with large portions."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Phoenix... Well really the best I've ever had anywhere ever. Pad thai- amazing, panang curry- holy sh*t, fried tofu -yes please!   This place is formally Pete's Thai. The new staff here is really friendly and seem really happy to have you dining at their restaurant.  The food presentation is perfect... The vegetables still are colorful and not over cooked. The waitress knew what was gluten free - which was basically everything on the menu. Oh and the plates they use are adorable. Hand painted white and blue china.   Pretty much every aspect was perfection."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff!  I was visiting family in Phoenix and was treated to a Sunday lunch at Reign of Thai.  It was amazing, but I think what makes this restaurant so great is it's personable staff.  They were quick to take our drink and food orders even though the place was slammed.  They also took pride in their buffet and made sure it was stocked often with fresh and hot food, straight from the kitchen.  Thanks for the incredible lunch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, quality and portions are as expected.  I have eaten here a few times, tonight will be the last.  It was a fairly busy evening, but nothing the wait staff should have had difficulty with. We ordered, my wife's dish came out 5 or so minutes before mine.  After the meal we both waited over 25 minutes for refills that we requested 4 times. The two employees were too busy trying to get us out the door than to actually listen to what we were requesting. We would start asking for more drinks and get interrupted with the same \"small kitchen, we are busy\" explanation. This is especially disappointing at a place that serves spicy food.   Luckily there are plenty of options to explore for Thai food in phoenix."}
{"text":"The service was great the owner and his son were amazing hosts. The atmosphere was awesome.  We came in and were pretty loud and full of vigor to try out some spice on our meals. The loudness and vigor slowly dwindled because two of us tried level 5 Spice (aka the hottest on the menu) on our meals. The spice was like lava, but it was stacked on top of the delicious flavors of the dish. It was a brutal fight, but man Level 5 is a monster, and I would suggest you at least try it once. Its a delicious burn, and you want to eat more but your tongue is like \"please, I want more of that flavor, but no more volcano.\"   It was also my first time at this establishment, and my friends are regulars. They convinced me to try to hottest level, and I wasn't disappointed. I love spicy food, and this was top notch 10/10 would come again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai buffet. Got here 3 minutes before 2pm and they seated me and kept cooking items to keep the buffet topped off for myself and the other guests still enjoying lunch. They had pad thai and spicy basil noodles, 2 kinds of soup, fried rice, jasmine rice, 4-5 different curry entrees, egg plant, and tofu entrees etc. Big selection. The food was hot (temperature) the spiciness was mild but tasted good. The meal was an excellent value when you consider it's all you can eat. I like this buffet better than Pink Pepper."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the wonton and hot and sour soup, as well basil chicken and shrimp. Everything was perfect. Great heat...we ordered the one and two heat level and it was pleasantly hot. Shawn, our server was  terrific!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Even the second time I ordered take out from them, they remembered who I was when I came to pick it up! Love their pineapple red and green curries! Be warned though- if you can't handle hot n' spicy stick to level 1 or 2! I love spicy food, but even their level 3 gets pretty intense! :)"}
{"text":"My best friend and I had been looking at this place for a while and were thrilled to try it. We weren't dissapointed! The lunch buffet is delicious even thought we expected a bit more of variety. The food was hot and had so much flavor. I never had curry before until this place and it was so good! The service was amazing, the manager I believe was very attentive to our water glasses and would take our dirty plates in an instant. I wish i could say that about other places. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is amazingly good. The service is awesome. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So Good! The buffet is excellent, very reasonably priced. My favorites are spicy basil chicken, green curry, ginger chicken, coconut soup and the eggplant."}
{"text":"Best buffet so many different options love it they know me here and try to go once a week."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix! I have been coming here for years and whenever I have an out of town guest this is where I take them. Be careful though, their heat scale is very different. I don't like too much spice - even a 1 can be too hot so if you don't like spicy but want a little spice to go with your food, ask for a .5 and you can't go wrong. The thai coconut soup is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Food was good and authentic. Service was excellent. Giving 4 stars for now because I don't feel it was worth the price. I'm sure I'll go back for the buffet and say the opposite but $50 for two people is a little much and the dishes are on the small side so it's not like you can share. Very spicy but in a good way. I ordered a shrimp dish and there weren't very many shrimp but it has become the norm to skimp on the shrimp these days so I wasn't about to complain.  Egg rolls were very average, nothing special about those. Overall a good place since there's nothing comparable in the area.  When I go back I'll revise my review accordingly."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter are super picky so I don't always trust their recommendations on food; however, they were eating in this restaurant yesterday  and said how good it was and that they were going to bring me some takeout. OMG sometimes you stroll upon an absolute gem. Even though the takeout was cold I had reheated it was absolutely outstanding. I had pad Thai and Thai roles.  I can't say enough about the flavor profiles and how  absolutely delicious iit was. There he level between one and five. I was told that it is a very hot scale and to be conservative so I ordered  1.5. It was plenty hot. Absolute shame that this place is all the way across town from me."}
{"text":"Best THAI in PHX we've found by far. When you ask for spicy - you get spicy. Portions are generous and well executed. The yellow and red curries are out of this world. Great menu with plenty of choices. Very cozy atmosphere and take-out is a breeze. Staff is always warm and friendly. There are a lot of Thai places in Phoenix to consider but not many who can hit the authenticity and overall value Reign of Thai can. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Got take out last night. Food was flavorful and had a good spice to it. Ordered everything medium and it was plenty spicy. I will order again."}
{"text":"It's been really hard for me to find Thai food since I've moved to AZ from MI and the food here is great!! My husband doesn't like Thai as much as I do , but he loves Reign of Thai. I still have yet to find that hidden gem, but this place comes really close!!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! The Panang Curry was great. Things run on the spicy side so keep that in mind! Great place!"}
{"text":"oooh the spice level here is truly thai spicy. people are so friendly and entertaining here. we had red curry and spicy thai basil fried rice. the guy really looked out for us on spice level. we eat pretty spicy hot food and three was just as much hot I could take. so if u don't eat hot spicy stick to one. really happy with our dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Holy monkeys ! Be prepared to have your taste buds burned off ! I was so excited to try them based off of their reviews ! Unfortunately was not warned (and hadn't read) about their spiciness being a little over the top .  I'm one that can normally handle a 4 . But tonight went for a 3 on my pad-se-ew and my mom did a 2 on her pad Thai . I'm glad I went down one ! Mine was barely tolerable and had tears running down my cheeks .. my mom was coughing and gave up a few bites in .  It was a great flavor but disappointing that we could only get a quarter of it down without feeling sick . Definitely would like to have been warned they run on the higher side .  Another downer was we had taken it to go and had ordered their $2 cucumber salad side and it came in a dipping sauce cup . For $2 I feel like you should be getting more .  I'll definitely try them again , just maybe at a 1.5 spiciness !"}
{"text":"Came here to Phoenix for a graduation. Enjoyed all the dishes we had here. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Certainly worth going too for some yummy Thai food"}
{"text":"Excellent service, even better food.  Authentic Thai with just the right spices.  Level 5 is not for the novice.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for awhile. We finally decided to go at lunch, best decision ever! The food was delicious. I loved the open buffet. Must try."}
{"text":"Probably the best thai food I had. When I ordered the server asked how hot I wanted my food,  so I said \"thai hot\" , he said that was about a 4 on a scale to 5. So I asked to get it as hot as possible.  He looked at me like I was crazy,  so I looked at him like he was crazy for thinking I couldn't the heat,  so I asked for a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. The food was so hot I might as well have been eating the peppers,  but it was so good I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":".   If I didn't know the place was there I would have driven right by. The building is old and ugly but once you step inside and experience the food you forget what the building looks like.  We went for the buffet. It is so worth it. If you like Thai this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet that they have Tues - Friday for $9.99/person, $2.50 for drinks. There's also a beer and wine bar.   The food was delicious with a simple yet sufficient menu choices. There were 4 different kinds of curry (the yellow curry was the best in my opinion), 2 kinds of noodle dishes and a few vegetarian options as well (eggplant and tofu was really good). The service was friendly and fast and the price was extremely reasonable. We would definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night at 6. Don't ever make that mistake. Waited 20 minutes after we ordered our drink and left. The guy started taking other orders for people that arrived after us. We, the forgotten and thirsty, decided to give our patronage to another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the metro Phoenix area.  This restaurant offers authentic Thai food and is family owned and run. You go for the food not necessarily the ambiance or elegance. Moderately priced. Wine and beer are offered. Fish cakes are FANTASTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is probably the nastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life.   I'm not a big fan of buffets but I was decide to try this because it was only two hours and it's Thai!   We walked in and weren't acknowledged for like 3 minutes. Then we were seated and given water but no one came and asked about another drink; we have to track someone down. I tried the fried rice, it was sticky and lacked flavor. Then I got the spicy chicken basil, eggplant tofu, and vegetables. I kid you not, every single dish tasted exactly the same with this nasty sweet flavor. I barely touched it. Then I went to get some muscles. They were dry and were nothing special. We barely ate anything.   My friend and I both ended up paying $17 each. I don't mind spending money on food because I love food..but I love good food. I feel like I would have felt more satisfied with  throwing that money into the garbage instead of that food that tastes like garbage."}
{"text":"Hands down the best.  Pro tip:  Order 2 spice levels down from what u would at other spots.  RoT don't mess!  Real deal.  Everything on the menu is bomb.  Personal faves= green curry, noodle soup, pad Thai (out of this world), lemongrass soup, panang."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and it was really, really good.  Had Tom Yum and a peanut curry dish and both were very tasty.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Service is always good here and the food is super tasty. I come here often with my friend when they serve lunch buffets. Today I stopped in 10 mins after they stopped serving their lunch buffet and got something from their regular menu. My friend and I were the only customers and the only reason Im giving them 2 stars is because they (all three servers) acted like we weren't there. They were talking so loud while they were cleaning up the tables and we felt that it was very rude to do it while we were there. Those kind of conversations can be discussed in the back or when there is no one at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. My husband and I literally could not stop eating. It's super flavorful! Stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet on a friend's recommendation. I'ld never been to a Thai buffet and figured it would be a great way to sample all the different curries and Thai dishes I love. The outside of the building is not enticing (hence the 4 stars). Driving by you would probably pass it up because it's located right next to a mechanics garage. Overlook this and give it a try. When you walk inside from the bright sun it seems a bit dark because only one wall had windows. I like lots of natural light and so I asked for a table by the windows. They were a bit reluctant because the only table available was a 5 top and there were only 2 of us. Fortunately we came after the lunch crowd rush so they let us have it. The inside is kind of warehouse industrial with the exposed ceilings. Everything is painted black in the ceiling so it doesn't look unfinished. I've learned in all my years not to judge the food by the decor and also  because it was recommended by a friend.   So glad I kept an open mind because this was a real treat! They had all the curries in the buffet...Massaman, Panang, green, yellow, and coconut. I believe they all had chicken in them if I remember correctly.   My friend is skinny and decided to honor her figure and not do the buffet. In my opinion a Big mistake. She chose the Massaman and that's all she got. I got to savor and enjoy ALL of them and more for the same price! My favorites were the Massaman and yellow. Of course they had Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew and some other stir fried dishes. Think there were 2 different soups. Everything I tried I enjoyed. I soon ran out of room to try anything else. I was over the moon with the curries.  My only disappointment was with the Thai Tea. I wish restaurant owners would stop using their coffee brewers to brew tea and have a designated tea brewer only. You guessed it, my tea also tasted of coffee. I am particularly picky because I am one of few Americans who don't like coffee. Also why I gave 4 stars.   This restaurant is a long way from where I live in the valley but if in the area I would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Authentic Thai food! So delicious! I love finding local places like hidden gems! This place is definitely one!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the Tom Kha soup here. They use real thai peppers and Chili's for their spice which makes it authentically flavorful. The pad thai is also made properly with generous portions! And it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Are you a dare devil? Do you love to turn up the heat? Do your taste buds want to tango with spices? Do you want to experience an out of this world feeling?!?! If you answered yes to at least one of these questions well look no further my friend, this place has you covered! I ordered the Shrimp fried rice with basil, since I'm a dare devil I ordered level 4 on the spicy meter. So you have an option of going all the way to Thai hot which is a 5 in this restaurant. The young lady was nice enough to tell me there level 4 is usually Thai hot for other establishments. Mmmm my mouth gets watery just of the thought of that spiciness! The plate came with 6 decent sized juicy shrimps and the rice was cooked to perfection not too hard and no mushiness here. After couple scoops my mouth was caliente caliente and my heart racing! I proceeded to take a sip of iced, refreshing, sweet Thai tea, so delicious! Brought me back to earth with all the savory spices in the air. Even if your not into the spiciness the flavors alone will have you entering a different world dimension! Don't take my word for it I highly recommend you to try this place for yourself. Hey! While your at it don't forget to invite me I'm more than happy to tag along!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in for a bite to eat during lunch hours on Sunday to try the buffet. To be honest I expected the buffet to be a little bigger than 2 carts in the corner of the room. The food was good I really enjoyed the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"This is the second time I enjoy Thai foods. This spot is a very nice place, very clean and sanitized. We tried Thai basil and chicken, it was delicious and fresh. We also enjoyed fried rice and egg rolls, hmm It's good overall. I'll give them 5 stars next time visit."}
{"text":"We were on a trip from Valencia to Phoenix to help a friend find a new home. We lucked out that the condo we rented was down the street from this restaurant. one evening we drove by and the restaurant was packed! we decided to go the next night and are VERY happy we did. We were immediately warmly greeted when we arrived and ushered to a very nice table. For the dinner serving there is regular menu, no buffet, (which I'd rather have). we were waited on by the owner and his Uncle Ott. they were both very helpful and engaging. we ordered the Pad Thai, and Pad See Yew. both dishes were amazing, and so much food, we couldn't finish the servings. we are in a different state, but when we are in Phoenix, we will return to Reign Of Thai."}
{"text":"First time customer.  We got there at 2:30 Saturday afternoon and their sign yelp said they close at 3pm.  Their website says 12-9.  Upon walking in we were told you \"You cant eat here, we close in a half hour you can only order take out\". No hi or welcome.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and quickly eat since we were in a hurry.  The gentleman told us \"yea, if you don't mind sitting next to these dirty dishes.\" Who says that to a customer? I really wanted to try the food because the reviews here are awesome.  We ordered yellow curry.  Asked how the heat was and he really couldn't explain it.  He was not nice at all, rather annoyed we were here 30 min prior to close. I ordered it medium and waited.  No water was offered while we waited or any beverage order for that matter.  Our food was done at 3 and he proceeded to pack it up to go.   I've never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant in all of my life. We intended on eating out and running errands, but having been forced to take out we took it home.   Curry flavor was delicious but mostly veggies hardly any chicken. Super disappointed in the treatment we received and for that I'm afraid we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We love everything about this place. The food, the owner, the atmosphere inside. We have been here many times and have never been disappointed in the food or service. The Tom Ka Gai is a must have. It is full of flavor and the best I have had. We have tried everything from noodle dishes to curries to the teriyaki and fried rice. Excellent! Freshly prepared. So lucky to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Totally out of the way in an unassuming location, very good Thai food.  Came on the recommendation of a friend and we will be back when we can.  Ordered the tom yum with chicken, beef and basil, papaya salad with dried shrimp, and a pad thai.  They apparently only use Thai chilis so on their 1-5 scale, 2 has enough kick to make it worth your while.  The papaya salad was one of the best we've had.  Good fish sauce balanced with some heat and some sweetness.  It was crunchy, refreshing, and rivaled Lotus of Siam in Vegas.  The tom yum was also pretty good - served family style in a hotpot.  It had a lot of heat, but lacked some traditional sourness.  Might have been trying to accommodate Western tastes, so if you're looking for a particularly sour kick from your tom yum, this is not the place.  BUT, it is tasty here, with heavy notes of lemongrass and ginger.  The beef and basil stir fry was fine.  Nothing really special.  It was tasty, no complaints, nothing to rave about.  The pad thai here is good, with our only complaint being that it is a little tamarind heavy.  The noodles were just a tad overcooked, but we appreciated the general balance of their sauce (with again, just a little too much tamarind.)  But I appreciate that it was not the overly sweet mess that you get at most Thai places here - there was appropriate sourness and saltiness and heat all mixed in, with the sweetness playing second fiddle to the rest.  So an unexpected surprise in the Valley for Thai - and it just MIGHT be the best Thai in town.  Couple other places to go or retry before a final determination, but this place is legit."}
{"text":"Review on the buffet. Food is decent. Spicy dishes not overly spicy but oily. Dishes are flavorful. About 6 different curries to try. Not much stuff inside the curry. They had some steamed veggies that I just added to my curry. Also, they didn't refill their stuff often. So there was supposed to be a fish dish, but they refilled the eggs rolls and the fried wonton like twice instead. So you can see what they want you to stuff yourself up with first.    The flavor of the pad see ew was good, but I just didn't like the overly oilyness. Also, the fried rice was not good. Just hard. The pad thai is okay.   No sweet desserts..."}
{"text":"Bummed!! Tried this place twice now, after reading all these good reviews I figured my first experience must had been a fluke so I went back to give it another try... Unfortunately my second experience was even worse. This place is ran by young kids who are sweet, but very unorganized and careless. Shouting across tables in this tiny restaurant  to ask where the missing food is, and an obvious lack of professionalism, which makes their extra long wait time akward and uncomfortable. There is no music playing or anything to distract you, and sitting under bright fluorescent lights unfortunately just really adds to the akward vibe. Now the important part is, if the food was good I could care less about an akward vibe... But the food is not good. Or fresh :( My vegetables and meat tasted and looked OLD both times I visited. I really wanted to like this place and gave it a second try, hoping the second time would be better than the first. But both times I was beyond let down. If you want fresh quality ingredients,  a clean and nice vibe, this is not your spot."}
{"text":"Pro: good service , authentic Thai food, curry heaven Cons: lunch buffet empty out fast, they can't keep up as they cook in small batches   Kids love the calamari and chicken satay"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try different Thai restaurants around the neighborhood and I've had this one bookmarked for awhile. We finally visited for our first time last week. Thai cuisine is a staple in our family of two...we eat out for it, we cook a lot of it...so we know what we like and how we like it. So of course, we ordered our two favorite dishes - pad see ew and yellow curry. 5/5 on both dishes I have to say. We were able to customize spice level and dietary restrictions. We were able to make the curry vegan and take out the fish sauce! Love how accommodating the chef and servers were! I didn't get a chance to ask about the buffet and whether or not it was veg friendly - but next time we come in for dinner, we'll be inquiring for sure.   Location was interesting. Right off a main road and in an odd shaped parking lot. Didn't stop people from coming in that's for sure. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, probably only seemed prolonged because we were quite hungry.    Also, The spice level is no joke. I initially asked for 3/5 but our server suggested I get a 2. It was definitely more than enough. I probably could've went for a 1/5 to be quite honest. Happy that our server knew what she was feeding us!   We'll be back here pretty soon!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little place. Friendly staff, great service and oh my heat! I like spicy and this place takes it up a notch! They can alter the dish to accommodate gluten-free patrons. I had the spicy noodle with shrimp, which was not overcooked and had some great veggies in there. I had a 2 star and probably should have stuck with a 1 or 1.5. I also had the massaman curry. Very flavorful, lots of sauce, potatoes, bamboo shoots and chicken. There will be a next time for sure as I'd love to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Probably one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've enjoyed... certainly in this part of town.  Have always enjoyed the lunch buffet and dined with friends for dinner several times always a lovely meal. Thanks"}
{"text":"My airbnb host recommended this place when he learned I love Thai food...  Best Thai ever, hands down. Flavorful, spices, and so well made it's mind boggling...but not Thai hot, do don't expect insane awesome spice, but still satisfying (this whole review is about the buffet)  I started with the wontons and rolls, fried rice and noodle dishes on the buffet closest the bar. It was all superb. The best was the spicy chicken noodles and wontons.  Next came the currys...all of them, fantastic. The selections on the buffets are limited to mostly vegetarian and chicken dishes but it's still the best option to satisfy a Thai craving because of all the yummyness...  My only complaint about this place...it's not in Denver!  Eat here. I will be back...oh yes...I will."}
{"text":"Reign of Thai! Taste likes my momma' cooking!! A drive but worth it!!! Delicious! Delicious!"}
{"text":"ASININE PLACE:  I'm lowering my previous 3-star review to 1 star as a result of my most recent experience at this restaurant.  A friend and I popped in for some tom ka gai soup and sweet and sour chicken on a weekday evening.  The soup was first rate, properly spiced, flavorful and full of tender chicken chunks.  The problem was with the sweet and sour chicken stir fry.  The chicken in that dish wasn't stir-fried, rather it appeared to have been deep fried several times over to the point where you could literally break and tooth chewing on it.  When I called it to the waiter's attention he copped on attitude with me, then tried to shame us for sending it back before eventually apologizing and offering to remove it from the bill.  And despite the over-staffing of this small place, the service was atrocious.  We were not greeted at the door when we arrived, and two different employees frowned at us while we were waiting to be seated.  Something's definitely wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this little place tonight and we are so happy we did. I wanted spicy food and this place didn't disappoint. We got the coconut soup which was fantastic, level 2 hot was perfectly hot without being painful. Also, Panang curry with squid and the sticky rice with mango. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"DUDE.   Like DUDE. After one of my foodie AZN home girls told me about an ALL YOU CAN EAT Thai joint, it's been lingering in the back of my head.   One day, after a night of douchebaggery, my AZN brother  Mikey told me that I need to check this out with him. The rest my friends, is HISTORAAYYYY.   Pad Thai, green curry, yellow curry, OH MY!  Tom Yum, basil chicken, pad se yew, OH SHIEEET!   I am the type of eater that likes to try multiple things at once so I was truly in my happy place.   I love this place with a strong, infinite passion."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the service was amazing. The owner was personally refilling our drinks and making sure everything was great. I had the green curry and it became my new favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at Reign of Thai. It started when I asked our waiter to tell me more about one of the dishes and he refused, saying that in all restaurants all waiters are always trained to say every single dish is the most amazing. The wait for our food was very long, and when my Pad See Ew finally came, the noodles were completely overlooked, the scrambled egg was burnt, and there was no sauce whatsoever. When I told the waiter this, he told me \"this is how we make it here.\" (Another person at my table ordered the same thing and had both sauce and not burnt egg...) My husband had ordered an entree with beef that had maybe 1-2 ounces of actual meat in it, and the waiter's response to that was \"we put in five ounces.\" Not \"I'm sorry\" or anything like that, merely a statement indicating that we were lying.  I have two stars because other people at or table had good food; my experience was definitely marred by the waiter's rudeness."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found in Phoenix! Not only is the food amazing, but the service is great and the servers are genuine. They are easy to talk to and will give you honest recommendations on the food and spice level. DEFINITELY check it out!"}
{"text":"we came for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the lunch buffet.  Tried al of the curries and could not decide which one we licked best.  We are looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Bad day at work, lost my brothers drone, first bright spot of the day... Reign of Thai. My family and I have been coming here for the past 5 years. Even with the change of owner, the food is consistently amazing. We refer everyone here and they're never disappointed.  The owner is quick to recognize us and very friendly. Awesome atmosphere and the food is outstanding!!   I highly recommend the cashew nut chicken, pad thai, and the coconut soup!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai food, and Reign of Thai is the best Thai food we've found in the Phoenix area. Having been to Thailand and experiencing authentic Thai cuisine, the food at Reign of Thai is spot on. Their menu is huge and provides many different flavor combinations. If you're a vegetarian like me, you can get most of their dishes prepared with tofu or vegetables instead of meat. Their serving dishes are beautifully shaped and painted. We've never been during buffet hours, but we've heard the buffet is excellent. The value for your money is great considering the quality of the ingredients and healthy portion sizes. When ordering your food, the server always asks what level of spiciness you'd like (1-5). They definitely know spicy food, so anything higher than a 2 is very hot!  I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Satsay, the last time we dined at Reign of Thai. He was very welcoming and spoke with pride about the quality of their food. He and his wife go shopping daily to pick up fresh ingredients from a variety of locations.  Thank you Reign of Thai for providing a consistently great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Really Authentic Thai food. Incredible flavors but watch out for the spice! My favorite starter was the Tom-Kah soup(spice level 2) and the crowd favorite entrée was the garlic beef."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was AWSOME! They have spicier food then most Thai places so watch out for that. The coconut soup was amazing. And fancily displayed. We are defiantly coming back soon. Wait staff was attentive and informative as well as friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down some if the best Thai food I've ever had. Pad see yew was amazing. Will be back"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience at Reign of Thai. My to go order was messed up and instead of making it right, the manager just said too bad. A dish that I asked for no spice was very hot. The manager should have apologized and remade the dishes but he was very rude and just tole me to leave. It was incredibly unprofessional.  I used to be a regular but I am not coming back. There are plenty of good Thai places in town who put customers first."}
{"text":"Genuinely the best Thai I have had in Phoenix. The spice is intense - which the waitress warned us about - and the food was perfectly cooked. I highly recommend this place. Especially the pa-naeng curry!"}
{"text":"We visited Reign of Thai on Sunday for lunch buffet. The restaurant seems popular yet not too crowded. There are a relatively large variety of choices, including several types of curry (from non-spicy to moderate spicy), seafood (like mussels and fish), main food (like pad thai, fried rice, wontons), and assorted veggies. They don't look very fancy, but are just tasty, which also gives you a hint of a real Thai flavor. Services are ok and kind of efficient. The only thing I would suggest is that the Thai tea is a little too sweet even with lots of ice. For $11.99 per person, it is really worth the money and the time you spend there with friends and family. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Decent food. They definitely know how to make their food spicy. However, none of their dishes had fish sauce or lime. How can you serve Thai food without either of them?"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco and was so beyond stoked to visit this spot. Incredibly delicious and wonderful service. I will be coming back here every time I visit. I've been to Thai spots in a lot of cities....this is one of the best!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffett. Had two tables with several dishes to choose from. Really liked the mussels. Would go back."}
{"text":"I've tried the lunch buffet and it is really good.  The food is fresh and there is a good variety to choose from.  The service is helpful and friendly.  I have not tried dinner off the menu yet, but that is next!"}
{"text":"Reign of Thai is right on Thunderbird and Cave Creek, the restaurant from the street may look sketchy, but don't judge a book by the cover.   Food; Probably the best tasting Thai food I have had, the Red Curry Chicken medium level was amazing, the taste was perfect along with the heat level.  My Mother got the Orange Chicken, which was crispy and delicious.  Service; Michelle was AMAZING she was so patient with my Mother that is a difficult customer.  She was very outgoing and friendly."}
{"text":"Good buffet! We ate way too much! Great noodles and soup and eggplant. Curry was a bit bland but not horrible. If we are in the area again, will be back. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was AWESOME. Perfectly cooked vegetables, everything was piping hot and super fresh, topped with tasty seasonings. Lots of curries, veggie-heavy dishes, and a few good choices for vegetarians. Two of us eat gluten free, and we had at least a dozen choices."}
{"text":"Walked in wasn't that busy, waited about 3 minutes to get sat down at a table with cracked glass. Ordered Tom Kah and a Thai iced tea. The Thai iced tea we got right away and was phenomenal, the tom Kah didn't come out until AFTER our very spicy Pad see Ew (we ordered a 1). Our Tom Kah finally came and it tasted like a 10 on their 5 scale.  Took over 10 minutes for a server to come by and we never got any refills. Was excited to try a new place and after reading the reviews thought it would be good. Unfortunately this placed missed the mark. A gentlemen agreed to take the Tom Kah off our bill after we asked hence the reason for 3 stars instead of 1"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it's been delicious! Finally was able to come for their weekday lunch buffet... and it was so worth ~$10. I love their coconut chicken soup with a hint of spice, pad thai, fat noodles, and spicy basil chicken.... others tasted good as well but I forgot what they were called... the staff were very nice and attentive. The decor was beautiful and felt authentic. I'm definitely coming back!  (Note: parking lot is a bit awkward to get into, but worked)"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai spot. I was hooked the first time i came, and came back 3 other times because i was so excited to show each friend this place! The greatest part is this location is walking distance from my house. At first, the place looked a little iffy on the outside, but on the inside it's very nice, cute, and the food is amazing! I love the glasses they use for water and the fish shaped dishes they use for the pad thai plates. I ordered the tofu coconut soup, shrimp pad Thai, and Thai tea. I recommend trying all of them!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food in North Phoenix!!!  This is my new favorite go-to for Thai for sure!   We came here on a Wednesday night - we were seated right away and the service was very friendly and attentive.    The atmosphere is nothing fancy but is colorful and happy and you can actually hear yourself talk.  If you are into sports they even have TVs at the bar to catch a game.  We ordered the egg rolls - crispy and flavorful with an amazing sweet and sour sauce. I would have eaten a whole platter. For a starter I would get 2 per person as they are on the smaller side.  The we got the plain fried rice (level 1 hot) - amazing!!! Huge chunks of tender chicken, crisp green beans, yum!   We also got the green pineapple curry - with chicken (level 2 hot). Really good. With bamboo, peppers, etc. The sauce was nice and thin and fresh - perfect for drizzling over the white rice it comes with.   There were two of us and we had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.   Amazing!!!!   But beware of their spice levels and go with their recommendations!  I wouldn't go higher than level 2 and I like hot! Lol."}
{"text":"Best thai in Phoenix !!  Lunch buffet is awesome. I recently went for dinner to see how the quality was off the menu versus the buffet. Surprisingly they were both great.   This place is a can't miss -you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place tucked into a nice, private area. It's definitely a sit down place with a nice bar though. The prices are expected, but due to that I won't come by often and will only for more formal occasions. Other than that, they're food is phenomenally good and authentic. Additionally, the waiters are very customer service oriented and informative."}
{"text":"We had the lunch buffet for $10. Totally worth it.  There were 2 types of soup, including my favorite...coconut chicken.  The buffet also included 5 different types of curry, which were all delicious....yeah...i tried them all.  I half expected this place to be mediocre because it's buffet but it was superb. It's. A great place for someone new to Thia food because they have so much to choose from. My belly is full and happy."}
{"text":"I don't know, but I think it was just my luck. All the food was cold at the buffet, and a little sweet for my taste. Server was really nice and apologetic, but you thing that they would give you a discout. Nope!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending the ISC UYE here a couple weekends back and was pleasantly surprised by the Thai buffet offerings. This place has a legit buffet with dish after dish of fresh Thai foods (and the employees continuously brought out fresh food). They had a tasty lemongrass soup, a delicious spicy chicken dish, and several tasty curries. Additionally, their eggplant was tender and perfect. They had all types of meat, noodles, tofu, soups, curries, and even vegetarian spring rolls... huge range. This place is fairly far from my house, but If I were craving a Thai buffet, I would certainly return!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for Thai food.  I have not had a bad dish from this place.  Just when you think it could not get any better, you see that they do a lunch buffet (even on the weekends).  The owners are very friendly and wiling to help you make the right choice when it comes to the expansive menu.    Appetizer recommendations: Thai Toast Chicken Satay  Entrée recommendations: Big Fresh Noodles (Choose a meat, I go with chicken.) Pad See eew Pad Thai Yellow Curry (Can't remember the Thai name).  Don't forget to try the Thai Tea as well!  Be warned, the food does run spicy here.  When in doubt of how spicy, order it at 1."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Thai ! Everything is made fresh to order! Delicious! From the outside it looks tiny but it is spacious and cozy Thai atmosphere. The yellow curry is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this restaurant is rated so high. I felt that the buffet was overpriced for the amount of food that was available.  No dessert choices. Giving 2 stars since the service was good."}
{"text":"Really good food and nice service. It was buffet style for lunch and all the food was clean, warm and refilled fast. We never waited for anything. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place with delicious food and most importantly the staff were very nice, helpful and did their best to accommodate our lil 2 yr old. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"The Sunday buffet was excellent. The food was fresh and just the right amount of spicy, not too hot not too mild."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town! We have been getting takeout for quite sometime and it always is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was recently in the mood for Thai and stumbled upon this place on Yelp, which happened to be the only place that I found that has a lunch buffet. Since it was Sunday, it was $11.99 per person instead of the weekday pricing of $10.99.  Since I didn't want to spend the rest of the day suffering from food coma, I chose to do the take-out per pound. I got about $16 worth of Thai food which lasted an amazing 4 meals! Talk about getting bang for your buck! What's great about the take-out is that they have different types of containers so you can separate your dry stuff (noodles) from the wet stuff (curries). Being the stereotypical Asian that I am, I skipped the rice (hey, rice is cheap and you can make that at home) and went straight for the entrees.  For the curries, I tried the panang and massaman, the latter of which was better. Loved the peanut flavor in combination with the potatoes and chicken. I also tried to the flat broad noodle (I believe it was their version of Pad See Ew) which was OK and didn't have much in it aside from the noodles themselves. Perhaps it was towards the end of that batch and everyone else had taken the meat and veggies - who knows? I also tried the eggplant with tofu and the fish - both of which were pretty good. As opposed to other Thai restaurants that I've tried, they've definitely toned down the spiciness of the buffet options which is understandable considering they're catering towards a much larger crowd - just something to keep in mind in case you like ridiculously spicy Thai food. You may want to order a la carte if that's the case.  I enjoyed the food here and would come here again as prices as very reasonable - it's just too bad that it's 20 something minutes away from where I live!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed at Reign of Thai was a notice posted on each table. It's asking for patience while your meals are being prepared. This tells me that they are either understaffed or really popular. Either case, you have been forewarned so can't complain later.   We decided to order pad Thai, beef/vegetable garlic sauce and chicken yellow curry with choice of 1 to 5 spice levels in each of the dishes. 1 is not mild. The waitress recommend 0.5 if we wanted mild and she was right. 0.5 was still bit spicy. Level 3 on our curry dish was very spicy.   We started off with lemon grass chicken soup. This was really good and the lemon grass gave good flavor in the broth. I noticed as the soup cooled, the saltier the broth became.   The beef and vegetables with garlic sauce was really good. I just wished it was less sweet and more garlicky.  Other than that, the ingredients were fresh, beef was tender, and good flavor.  The best part of the chicken curry was the potatoes. It was really tasty and the portion was huge; enough for leftovers.  Th pad Thai was really good too. Next time, I would spice down because 3 was really spicy.   Overall very nice meal. Just remember to go when you are not in a hurry. Or opt for their lunch buffet which I'm looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!  The food is fantastic. Everything we've ordered, usually take-out, has been flavorful and just the right amount of spice (we do medium, three chilies I think ). We stop at the bar and have a glass of wine while waiting (I had a nice red blend) and the staff are friendly and personable.  For those that know the history of the building it's nice to see someone's finally making it work."}
{"text":"La comida excelente, sabores bien definidos con  ingredientes frescos y con muy buena sazón, pero el Buffet aunque tiene platillos bien seleccionados no se está rellenando constantemente, su buffet es de 11:30 a 2 pm y cuando llegamos a las 12:40 pm ya no había casi la mitad de los platos, arroz thai, curries de pollo, el verde, rollitos etc. Hasta la 1:40 pm comenzaron a rellenar algunos, después de la queja de un cliente.  Fue decepcionante, después de meses queriendo conocer este restaurante a la hora del lunch. La próxima vez pediremos a la carta."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Thai restaurant.  The staff is great and the food is absolutely wonderful. It's spicy the way I like it and a great variety of dishes are on the menu. I recommend the red chicken curry and Thai toast. There is also a great lunch buffet which is also a favorite time of mine to go. This is a must go to place if you're looking for great food, great service, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice. When I ordered my curry at a level 3 spice for takeout,  I couldn't even eat it. Thankfully I came back and dined in. The server was very helpful and adviced me that they skip \"mild\" and go straight to medium on their heat scale  (which is a 1). I ordered my tom kha at a level one and I'm so glad i did. It had the perfect amount of kick to it. The only thing I wish the server did for me was tell me that the tom kha served 4 people and was $16.00. I came here to eat by myself and ended up with this GIANT thing of soup. I had to invite a friend to come eat it with me. But the soup was the best tom kha I've ever had. The broth was coconuty and creamy and you could taste the lemon grass and all the flavors. Yes ,  the service is slow. But the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious. Quaint & Family Owned. I had actually had very little experience with Thai food before I went to eat here. I asked for a recommendation from the server with reserve and she did not disappoint; I now get the same thing everytime I go!  Since going to Reign of Thai, I've tried a few different Thai Spots around town... this one has been my favorite thus far. I have yet to come to their buffets; which are only available on certain nights. I should go though, as then I can try some new stuff! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Went here for the first time about a week ago. Ordered the Tom Kha soup, delicious, and the pad thai which was also very good.  We also had the papaya salad which was very yummy.  If i could make one suggestion however it would be that i wished their to go containers were not styrofoam. I am considered somewhat of a \"tree hugger\" haha so I always like to see companies who avoid plastics  (this means straws too! Those things are terrible and not necessary) and styrofoam. But as far as the food is concerned, it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"5 star rating for their pad thai and spiciness! Very authentic flavors. I enjoy other noodle dishes such as pad see ew and drunken noodles, but I definitely think their pad thai is much better than the other noodle dishes on the menu. Curries and soups are always delicious too! Of the 3 or 4 Thai restaurants in the block, this is my favorite when I'm craving pad thai. One portion size of this will feed a small family of four or one gluttonous foodie."}
{"text":"My soul left my freaking body. You heard me, I had an out of body experience going here. It's delicious.  Two buds and I went here for a quick meal, and we   ended up having numerous courses and orders. Great job."}
