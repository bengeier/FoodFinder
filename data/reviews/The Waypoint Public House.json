{"text":"SERVICE: Service here is very good. Attentive and courteous. 
FOOD: We've been here several times for brunch and a couple of times for dinner. Food has always been fantastic, but we prefer the brunch. Their breakfast burger and pork belly sandwich are outstanding.  
DRINKS: Well-stocked bar with extensive tap selection. Brunch cocktails are a must. Would recommend the salty dog or the eye opener.
ATMOSPHERE: Spacious. Outdoor seating for nicer days. Very large venue so even when it's crowded I don't feel packed in. Can be a little hard to find for first timers since it's located in an apartment complex, but well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! i am a vegetarian - my boyfriend is not - they offer lots of options for both of us! My boyfriend got the caesar salad with the tenderloin and loved it! I have a few of the veggie sandwiches and all have been wonderful.

Friendly service and great mixed drinks as well - the parking lot is a bit odd but its worth the trek even in the cold!"}
{"text":"Nice tap beer selection ranging from the typical Spotted Cow to better microbrews and imports. Deviled eggs were great. Poutin, although not the traditional Quebec preparation, was very good. Atmosphere is a little bland, but service seems fine. We'll go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Solid. Burger was delicious, fries were average, beer selection was great. Nice atmosphere, albeit it's kind of out of the way and difficult to find on the side of the building. Food is worth the walk though, and they also bring in food from local sources. Great place to grab lunch or have a beer with some tasty apps."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner there last Friday. We arrived about 9pm and asked to be seated outside. We waiting for at least five minutes and saw several servers before one came over. I was about to go back to the host stand to ask when she did. Her name was Andrea and she really saved this review. She said that we weren't assigned to her but she saw us sitting there and wanted to make sure we were taken care of. We told her we appreciated it. My fiancé ordered a bourbon on the rocks and I had their specialty rum punch. It was pretty good but I can't say I'd order it again.

We ordered the pub chips and quesadilla appetizers. They were delicious and left us too full to get any more food. I'd warn that you should not get the pub chips if you are not a garlic fan but we are so enjoyed them.

I would definitely go back for the food and the atmosphere. I think they will definitely do well and offer something different in the monona area."}
{"text":"Nice range of appetizers, salads and sandwiches complemented by a solid selection of craft beers and whiskeys - all served with an overlook of the waterfront and E-Way. Reasonable prices and some inspired cocktails round out the package. Definitely going back for the lightly dressed kale, deviled eggs and Brie burgers."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service and nice location. 
I went here today, had cheese curds an Oktoberfest beer, and the tilapia tacos! Seriously delicious! Great seasonings (not for people who cannot take spicyish food) on the tacos and I got house made potato chips too, also tasted great! My boyfriend had the 14 hour pulled pork sandwich and French fries. I had a bite of his sandwich and it was fantastic, it had pickeled onions on it and usually I really hate onions but the way they pickeled them tasted so delicious especially with the seasonings of the pulled pork. I also really loved that spinach was on the sandwich too, it's a healthier option than lettuce which is not nutritional at all. 
The staff was very attentive and no one stood around gabbing. Everyone was motivated and hard working and looked professional. 
They have a great beer menu and a pretty sizeable wine menu and quite a few different whiskey's and vodkas I was surprised about. 
We will definitely be going back, it's our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Hit the Friday fish a few weeks back, so just getting to the review.  My wife and I were seated right away, and it was crowded!  With the lack luster fish fry options around Madison, my expectations were rather low.  Pleasantly surprised, the baked fish was great.  Ordered fries and they were wonderful as well.  Just enough, both of us were happy.  I'm sort of a beer snob, didn't care for my Founders IPA coming in a mason jar.  I expect either a pint glass for the mid-level beer selection or the obvious smaller goblet for the 10oz high zoot offerings.  We will be back."}
{"text":"With a less than impressive view Waypoint Public House is a nice place for dinner and cocktails. The bar is large and plenty of room to accommodate their happy hour crowd. The craft cocktail list is not stellar, but bartenders do offer a decent seasonal variety on the drinks. Well I do enjoy the beer list, it changes in frequently. Regarding the food, it's pretty much standard gastro pub fare. Not quite bar food but not quite spectacular either. Now, with that being said, I am going to back track a bit and say that this is probably hands down the best place in Monona."}
{"text":"High quality beer list is what sells me on this place.  There's nobody else in the neighborhood with a tap list like this.  I'd even be impressed with this list downtown.  Prices for beer were excellent considering the high quality.  5-6 bucks for a limited release microbrew is a bargain, so I don't know why somebody else criticized the beer prices.  That said,  I'm sure they'll have their work cut out for them when Mr Brews opens up across the street this fall.
Had dinner here and the food wasn't quite as good as the beer.  Sandwiches were good and the Batch Bakehouse buns/breads were a great choice.  That said, the bread on the ABLT was overly buttered/oiled when it was toasted, leaving fingers covered in grease and distracting from the fact that the bread itself was really excellent.  The avocado in the ABLT and the veggie burger was a little underripe, but still tasty.  Kettle chips were excellent.  Folks around us seemed happy with their food and the nachos looked pretty impressive.
Décor was solid; nothing too exciting or dramatic, but it was sharp and clean.  Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the waterfront side of the restaurant so I can't speak to the view.  Noise level was surprisingly high, though the restaurant was pretty full."}
{"text":"This brand new place is a bit difficult to find, but it is worth looking for. Look for the new construction on the south side of Broadway next to Rutabaga.

The bar is spacious and bright. The woodwork is beautiful, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  There is a large, sunlit deck outside. Too bad you ignore the sounds of the cars whizzing by on the Beltline.  The food is typical bar sandwiches, but they are prepared very well and good portions.  We will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"I finally got the chace to try this place and was really excited about it only to be let down. The service was one of the worst I've come acrossed. Not sure of our waiter's name because he didn't introduce himself. The guy was unprofessional from his attitude to his choice of clothing. I wouldn't expect a server to wear a John Deer hat backwards. This guy made me feel like I was work for him.  He finally took our order and tables that came in after us were served before us. When we asked about our food he started walking away and said soon. When the bill came, he took our cards and didn't come back for 10 mins. No greeting, no smile, no care to give us great service.  I'm guessing he doesn't want return customers."}
{"text":"The selection of beer is great! They change out beers on tap about every 2-3 weeks. I used to live in the apartments above the restaurant, so it was perfect if I didn't feel like driving anywhere and to gather with friends. Their fried cheese curds are probably the best I've had in the area, and their view of the lake is nice on a warm summer evening. Bartenders and waitstaff are more than friendly, but I gave 4 instead of 5 because their entrees aren't all that good. Great place for friends to come together for some beers!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times came out a little disappointed. Mainly the food is mediocre.  The beer is great; plenty of taps and great Belgium imports."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. Amazing selection of beers & booze. But the wait staff...needs improvement!!!! Why is it so difficult to find quality waiters & waitresses in Madison? It's joy rocket science, people. I am giving 4 stars because I love the outdoors deck when the weather cooperates. And the indoor dining area has lots of nice touches. The drink options are impressive. I've had a few different entrees & haven't been disappointed yet (love the BLTA!). But there has got to be a way to find a qualified wait staff. Slow & inattentive is the standard here."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Waypoint from several friends. So on a recent sunny Friday afternoon, I found myself sitting at an outside table, taking in a spectacular view of the south Beltline. (Yes, that was sarcasm. There really is nothing to see here.) 

I started with what was billed as a rhubarb Collins. It was a nice drink, but there was no discernible rhubarb. Does the drink actually contain rhubarb? If not (rhubarb is out of season in September), either don't call it that - or take it off the menu. It was disappointing.

I followed my friends' recommendations on the food - tenderloin poutine and the Friday walleye special. Now, I'm a bit of a poutine slut, so it's hard to go wrong there. The base (fries, gravy and cheese) was great, the tenderloin on top, less so. It was a generous portion, but the slices were unevenly cooked (some rare, some well done). And the smoke! I know it's grilled, but I am not a fan of such heavy char. They could back off a bit on that and have a better dish. Also, please serve this with a steak knife. Just sayin'.

The fried walleye, on the other hand, was unreservedly excellent. The beer batter was super crisp and nicely seasoned, the fish was nicely cooked, and the fries were matchsticks of perfection. I would order this again in a heartbeat.

The outdoor seating experience was nice (the \"view\" is what it is), but would be enhanced by coming up with some better shade options. We were okay at our table, but others weren't. Maybe some larger - or adjustable - umbrellas? And put them on all tables.

Kudos to our server (Joe) for his friendly and efficient service.

If it were possible, I'd probably give Waypoint 3 1/2 stars. A couple of small, easily remedied misfires, but I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the most consistently outstanding dining experiences I have had in the last few years. The ingredients and preparation are always perfect. The salad greens seem like they come straight from the garden. I first had poutine in Montreal about 7 years ago and frankly I didn't get it until I had it at Waypoint. The tenderloin melts in your mouth and the curds blend perfectly with their gravy. I have never had a meal there less than excellent."}
{"text":"If I could separate out this rating for beer versus food, the beer would get 5 stars.   28 beers on tap the evening I was there.   As others have mentioned, the staff behind the bar were very helpful and friendly.
The atmosphere was also great; a little noisy but a cozy atmosphere overlooking the bay.   It would be a great place to take a date for a drink, especially during the warmer months when you can sit outside.
That being said, the food was not so great.  My friend and I both got the fish fry; she got the fried cod and I got grilled walleye.   The walleye fillet was small and over-seasoned.   The sweet potato fries were nothing spectacular.  The saving grace was the coleslaw...it tasted fresh and home-made.   For $17.45, I would have expected more for the walleye.  My friend's dish (fried cod) was average for a fish fry, so she tells me."}
{"text":"We stopped here after an afternoon of boating on Monona. In the Yaharra near the beltline. We started with the jalapeño poppers. Fresh not fried and spectacular spin on the appetizer. We all ordered a different dish and all was very good on taste and presentation. I ordered the Kale salad and it is amazing!! The taste of citrus and walnuts with the fresh kale was out of this world. I've been there twice in the last two weeks and the second time I added a salmon to the salad. It was a large piece of meat cooked to perfection.  We sat outside. They have lights and music to create a nice ambiance.  All the servers seem to love their job and take your orders and requests with a smile. We had the host come and clear some plates. Great to see teamwork as our server was really busy. We he a table of 5 and our food was out within 20 minutes. They even brought out my sons meal before hand which was sweet. I'm happy with the quality of food and happy that there's a nice place to stop by for a bite while out all day on our boat. My only concern is enough pier space for boats during the busy summer months. They also need to dredge one side of where the pier is to accommodate space for boats to tie up. Looking forward to more stops at this place."}
{"text":"I've visited Waypoint twice. Our first time was good. No complaints. The second time we didn't even make it to the food. My wife and I were enjoying a date night, stopped in for dinner. We were seated promptly and then our waitress got our waters immediately. Unfortunately we never saw her again after over 20 minutes of waiting we just walked out. They were not even busy so I have no idea what happened. Very disappointed. A one star experience the second visit and a four star experience the first visit equals out to a Two."}
{"text":"Pretty quiet. Food was ok. I'm sure it will be much better to enjoy in the summertime."}
{"text":"Location: nice place to hangout specially when u sit outside on the deck you get the lake view.
Staff: staff are friendly and welcoming. Service is good but do not expect much when it is crowded.
Food: had the tilapia tacos and was very good. Crispy, nice flavours and the sweet potato fries were just amazing. Need to try other stuff too.
Price: a bit pricey but what the hell. I live to eat"}
{"text":"We went over to The Waypoint for a friend's birthday tonight after hearing some good things. Beautiful atmosphere and decor! It's on the smaller side but not too crowded. All of the service was very friendly and our waitress checked in a few times to check on us with a big smile every time. I wasn't blown away by the food, although it did arrive pretty fast which was nice. I had a grilled chicken cheese sandwhich with their specialty flavors. The bun on the sandwich I had was pretty soggy and was falling apart and there wasn't much flavor to it. There were a ton of fries which were great though. My friend loved her burger and the unique fruit flavor addition so I'd definitely  recommend looking over the burger menu if you come in, it's got a nice variety. I've heard brunch is good so I might come back for that but probably not dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been to Waypoint a number of times now. We live in McFarland and it is nice to know that we don't have to travel downtown every time we want a yummy dinner. McFarland is great place to live but the food options are pretty minimal unless you want fast food or a super club atmosphere. Waypoint is just a short 5 minute drive for us and the reason we frequent so often. 

The food is always fantastic and the beer selection is great.  I've tried half the menu and never had a complaint. The patio is also great for those nice fall/summer Wisconsin days. 

The only issue I have is the service can lead you to desire more. Like I said, we've been there at least 8 times now and at least half of those times the servers and or bartenders are not as friendly or quick as you'd hope for. No one should have to sit at the bar for over five minutes before they get served with both bartenders walking by multiple times. Especially when the bar is only half full! You could at least stop by and say, 'hey folks, I will be back in a few minutes here is a menu to look at while you wait.'

If they can get the servers to be more attentive this place would definitely deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Good for groups. Food is solid. The patio is so nice on a sunny day or evening for sunset. Family-oriented; I always see cute babies when I go here... Love their appetizers. Staff is friendly and attentive. Good choice for an evening meal!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Waypoint. It's the only place like it in the area, so I really appreciate its presence in what I consider a dead zone for good, local (non-chain especially!) restaurants. My husband and I have been too many times to count for this exact reason. I like the ambiance/vibe and sitting at the bar is our favorite. Table service has been hit or miss in our experience but we've always been very happy with the bartenders. They have a great beer list and you can sample anything you'd like. It's definitely a super cozy spot for a cold beer! The food, like the service, is hit or miss. Some things have become favorites.. the Buffalo cauliflower bites and the tilapia tacos especially. Other winners are the lamb burger, chicken gyros, pub chips, nachos (we don't love the pulled pork so never add it) the avocado salad and the beet salad. Things I would avoid are the buffalo chicken wrap and the ABLT (love the sound of this sandwich but it didn't live up). We have been here with very big groups and our kids... it's a great spot for both of those, too!"}
{"text":"We tried Waypoint out for the first time tonight. My only complaint is that it was slightly hard to find. They would benefit from better signage (to where they are in the condo building. The restaurant itself was great. It had a nice ambience. There is an area of seating with nice water views. Our food was delivered fast, and our sandwiches were prepared exactly as requested. I had a Brie burger and it was fantastic. My stepson had a bacon chicken sandwich, which he also enjoyed. I was very pleased to find such a great place so close to home in Monona. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. They had my heart when I looked at the long draft beer list and then ordered the pork quesadilla, which is the best quesadilla I've ever tasted. Steak tacos, ABLT and the brisket Mac and cheese are all to die for. Seriously, if you're in Monona, check this place out. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but we were disappointed on a few fronts. My wife and I were seated at a group table despite numerous 2-tops being available. Nobody mentioned any of the specials advertised at the front of the restaurant . Our server made Dr. Ben Carson look like a coked-up cheerleader. The poutine was decent and we were able to get it with gravy on the side so as not to make the fries too soggy. The melted cheese curds were fresh and tasty but the gravy tasted somewhere between smoky and charred. The pieces of tenderloin were really chewy. Not great.  I'm reserving judgment on the Reuben  as I decided to take it home. My wife said the pulled pork sandwich she ordered was so wet and unpleasant that it reminded her of her mother's cooking. Not even a hint of smoke. Does the label 14 hour pork reflect how long the meat spent in the oven? Because that's not what we're hoping for. Most disappointing and hard to believe was the fact that both my wife's french fries and my pub chips arrived to the table completely unseasoned.  We will be coming back, only because I have to try the brie burger."}
{"text":"Things that are great about Waypoint: the outdoor patio right on lake Monona, the string lights on the patio, the beer selection, the pub chips with cheese and homemade ranch, the casual atmosphere. 

Things that could use improvement: we asked our waiter 3 times before we got our waters, the cheese to chip ratio was really skewed toward too much cheese, there were a ton of jalapeños on the nachos but hardly any other topping (other than cheese). Our server put the check out on our table after we clearly told him that we weren't ready to check out. The restaurant wasn't closing for another hour, but we felt pressured to leave. 

Minus our waiter, which I'll give the benefit of the doubt for being young and new, the rest of the staff was super friendly! My friends and I played Settlers of Catan, and the wait staff was really cool about it. Some of them came over and asked and chit chatted with us. All in all, some minor service changes and edits to appetizers would go a long way in making this an awesome summer spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for what we though was going to be lunch while out and about around the East Side.  When we arrived, we learned they were only serving brunch (it was Sunday around 1 PM).  After deciding that was okay, we sat at the bar to watch the Viking/Seahawks game that was going on.  
For my meal, I had the Pink Lemonade (Tito's vodka and pink lemonade) and the Huevos Rancheros.  I was not a fan of the black bean pico, but that's because I'm not a fan of beans in general.  The rest of the meal was spot on.  The brunch potatoes are superb, especially if you like your brunch with a kick.  They were crispy, cheesy and spicy-yum!  
Husband had the french toast with pecans and maple syrup.  He liked it, but it didn't seem to be anything spectacular to me.  He's not an egg fan, so that was pretty much the only thing on the menu that didn't have eggs.  I do wish they had a slightly expanded brunch menu, or at least served lunch as well so 'picky' people had options.
Their beer menu and liquor selection is expansive.  They have drinks for every taste.
I loved the decor as well; their bar is what I'd like in my basement some day!

I'll be back, I'm hoping to check out the after-work menu sometime with a co-worker!"}
{"text":"This place gets almost a failing grade from me. The servers are very friendly and nice. The food was far worst than my home cooked meals. My burger was cold and lacked flavor. The only other thing this place has going for it is the location. Get it together Wayside!"}
{"text":"First off, come for the beer and cocktail selection, then stay for the food.  The beer selection is 24 taps of high quality craft and import beer that changes regularly.  I've been here a handful of times and have always been able to have something I haven't had before.  Waypoint also has a huge selection of spirits which are mainly whiskeys and scotches, but there are also many different rums and tequilas.  The food is delicious.  The best thing is the 14-hour pulled pork which comes in its own sandwhich and quesdilla, on the namesake Waypoint burger, and available on the nachos.  House made pub chips topped with parmesan is a good choice for snacking.  The tenderloin poutine is a steak ontop fries smothered in gravy and cheese and is very shareable.  The burgers are made with ingredients from local suppliers.  I've had the Waypoint burger which, although good, had too much going on.  Its like, \"Hey, why don't we put all of our house specialties on one burger?\"  The Tex-Mex burger was very good.  Even though it had a lot going on also, it all worked together.

The place is a modern gastropub and has a couple table for larger groups.  There is an outdoor patio overlooking the Yahara River with a boat ramp right next door."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The service was sub-par. They kept walking away from me every time I tried to order anything. It wasnt busy and is not a good sign for a young business to have such under experienced people working on a Friday night. The cheese curd are some of the worst I have had since I moved to Madison. They seem to be breaded in store bought italian breadcrumbs and horribly over seasoned. The burger was over seasoned as well. Its hard to ruin hamburgers, but they did. Its too bad. Its a great location and a well run restaurant could easily do very well there. Im slowly getting used to the lackadaisical attitude when it comes to service in Madison, and that bums me out."}
{"text":"Went to the waypoint for lunch,very pleasant outdoor seating still under construction so I can't judge them for that. The best wedge salad my partner ever had and my Italian sandwich was excellent, large bar area with lots of brewski's . had the rhubarb Collins , it was not to sweet with a good pour a very good sipping drink. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested the Waypoint House for brunch this past Saturday. The vibe is super cool. We were seated overlooking the water. He had the pulled pork sandwich (which he was thrilled with) and pub chips (these were really average at best). I had the grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup. The soup was actually the highlight of meal. The sandwich did not have very much flavor at all, let alone tasting the cheese. Also, overall, the sandwich was not warm. Maybe, that is just a personal preference? When i want a grilled cheese, i want it hot...even the veggies. I would come back if someone really wanted to come here, but it would never be a \"go to\" for me. Overall, an alright place to come."}
{"text":"Went at the tail end of a Friday evening rush. First time, so our expectations were cautious; being fairly new, I expected the service to be spotty. We were trilled with our experience, and glad there's good option in the Monona area. The creativity from the kitchen was impressive, for example I ordered the jalapeno poppers, which were cut in half, broiled and crusty with an tasty sauce. Both our entrees were great--well above our bar-food expectations. And the beer choices were outstanding--had a Six Point, which is a Brooklyn beer brewed by a gZuy from Madison. The place was busy, which bodes well for long future. Service went flawlessly, something I would expect from a well-established restaurant. Welcome to Monona! Only Four stars? Seating arrangements are awkward and needs tweaking, especially from the entrance past the bar."}
{"text":"I recently visited Waypoint for brunch. The service was fine, but the drinks (had a salty dog) were ok and food was meh. The brunch menu was small. I had the Benedict and the sauce was thin and the english muffin was tough. My potatoes (which are deep fried) tasted charred. I told my server about this and she agreed they did seem overdone, but then did nothing about it. I will give it another shot to try out the patio on the water, but definitely was not impressed."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a couple beers. Seemed like a cool place with some nice views. The bartender at the time was either new or just not a real beer person but he was friendly and tried to do what he could to help. I'd be interested to try the food when in the area.

**UPDATE**
I stopped in again with my wife and a couple friends. The beer menu is still very good and the wait staff is friendly. I had the special which was pork tacos and they were excellent. We also got cheese curds for the table and they were awesome. The prices are reasonable and it's just a cool place with a nice view. I would recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"The tenders and everyone who works here (that I have met) are supper nice and informed.  Beer selection is unmatched with constantly changing and evolving variety.   The food menu is innovative and reminiscent of North Woods fare and altogether great.  Great place to enjoy a cold, clever, well crafted beer and nice company.   Would be five stars but ... face it I am a food snob."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Waypoint, and there was no turning back!

It's our little group's favorite go-to spot for drinks and relaxation. The drinks and the food are great, but it's truly the staff that keeps us going back. It's awesome that the staff remembers our fun nicknames, and they take the time to chat with us whenever they can. The atmosphere is welcoming, and while it gets a little noisy at times, it's never too overwhelmingly busy that makes people think twice about going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Is this a gastropub? Who cares!

Waypoint is one of the best casual places to get a good meal on the east end of the Beltine.

You'll probably notice the sign for Treysta on the high-rise building at this address...the restaurant is down the walkway on the right side as you face the building from the road. 

The restaurant is spacious, with plenty of seating at the bar, in the dining room, throughout an open space adjacent to the bar, and the patio overlooking the Yahara River. At peak times, the interior lends itself to making the space somewhat noisy, but that can probably be offset by requesting a table in the dining area near the entrance, or by sitting outside. 

The go-to appetizer for bigger groups when I visit has been the Poutine, which features beef tenderloin and a generous portion of cheese curds. Two people could take down an order, but it's easily enough for four to share considering the size of the entrees. 

Over a dozen or so visits in the last two years, my wife and I have tried the Reuben, ABLT, Classic Burger, Salmon Dinner, Fish Fry, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Bacon Chicken Sandwich, and Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Pretty much everything we've tried has been very good, as the food comes out hot, and without an excessive wait. 

The sides are all adequate, though the chips and fried potatoes are seasoned pretty heavily, so  those who prefer a more mild option should probably stick to the regular fries or greens. 

The tap list runs at least 20 deep, changes frequently, and features craft offerings from quality breweries around the world. 

We've never had room for dessert, so I'll leave that to the other reviewers who are better about saving room for it. 

TL;DR: Waypoint has good service, a nice atmosphere, plenty of strong items on the menu, and a deep selection of beers."}
{"text":"Really bummed I couldn't give this 5 stars, because my food was great! I had cheese curds as an appetizer and they were some of the best I've ever had. For the entree, I had a bun-less salmon burger. The aioli was delicious as was the salmon. However, our service was very poor. When asking what beers they had on tap our waitress simply said \"I don't know, look at the menu?\" We also didn't receive plates for our appetizer, and never even received a smile! I have never had such a bad experience with a waitress. Hoping this isn't a common occurrence, just someone having a bad day, because the food was great."}
{"text":"The WPH has been here for a few years, but for some reason we have never eaten here... until recently. We didn't wait long for our second trip to try the fish fry-

We sat at a table that was across the room from the fireplace, which made the room warm and cozy on a cold winters night. Both my wife and I went all in and both ordered the fried walleye. We don't usually do this, we typically like to share for more variety. Glad we didn't this time- I didn't want to share this succulent piece of crusty goodness!

The fish- it's flakey and perfectly encapsulates the large fillet with a fried cracker-ish crust that was seasoned quite well.   The accompanying tarter had a little kick that tastes like it has both horseradish and a touch of Sriracha... it's yummy!

The coleslaw was creamy- wish there were a little more on the plate. 

I got salad- vinaigrette dressing over mixed greens. 

Bonnie L got the sweet potato fries. They were not bad, but with how good everything else
Is, they could do better here

The beer selection is pretty legit here. I got a Duchesse de Bourgogne in the proper glass!!!  Only in Belgium have I been able to drink this on tap.  If you like sour beers, this is one of the best!

If you haven't been here- check it out!"}
{"text":"Really great for brunch. Corn beef hash is the best around. Not a huge fan of the cream sauce on the breakfast potatoes but I appreciate they tell you about it when ordering. The beer selection is really great. Will go again."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and always look for local spots over corporate food so this was good find. Great patio. Menu had several options we were interested in. The nachos were easy to share with our group, had fresh toppings (no jarred Jalepanos)  and weren't coated in cheese sauce (thank you! Too many places think this is a good idea). Kale salad was good, salmon was a little under cooked. Large selection of local beers. We will be back next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is fast. The food is very good. I like the salmon sandwich and the breakfast burger. The drinks are excellent. I wish that they would serve food later, however. It would be profitable, I think."}
{"text":"We live nearby and come here about once a month. Food is always fantastic (try the fish tacos, rueben, or avocado BLT). Prices are decent, staff is friendly and there's a great selection of local, domestic, and imported beers. Patio on the lake also is nice when the weather is accommodating."}
{"text":"Review as a restaurant  not a bar.  I really wanted  to love the tenderloin poutine, but the gravy was odd and the steak precooked.  But the really offputting part, was just how damn salty the dish was overall.  

Branch has been better and I especially like the breakfast steak with aoili potatoes and chimichurri sauce."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Great food and, always, friendly service! I'm so sorry for not getting name right, but Gina, Jenny, Geanie, g something....makes awesome chocolate martinis! Anyways, fun atmosphere and always busy. :)"}
{"text":"Came for brunch with my family. A limited menu, but excellently prepared. Order with absolute confidence from the menu. Walleye, French toast, and juevos rancheros all got good reviews from us. Good Bloody Mary as well. Service was attentive and friendly. Decor is a bit suburban, but that's personal taste I suppose. Would be excellent for large groups for brunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a handful of times now and think this place is pretty good. I have tried several of their appetizers and they never disappoint. The main menu needs a bit more variety in my opinion. I've succumbed to the idea that the pulled pork sandwich has become my go-to due to the lack of variety. The bottom of the batch bun tends to get a big soggy and falls apart to the point that I think it is downright dry, but the meat is delicious!  The coleslaw and fries are very good side dishes. The people that I have gone with have always enjoyed their entrees. I feel like the menu is just upscale bar food, which may be what they're going for, but not what I was expecting.  The restaurant has a great location, appears very clean, and has very cool decor and set up."}
{"text":"Good beer menu, but nothing on Dextors or Masons. Not much in the way of great food. Not bad but as most Wisconsin bars it is geared around the beep fryer. If you like deep fried and bacon this is your place. Be prepared for $11 dollar burgers and 12 dollar pork quesadillia!"}
{"text":"Nice setting except for the highway noise.  Lots of gluten free options, but the cheese platter is disappointing. Way overpriced for what you get. Management took $$ off for it and that was nice.  Deviled eggs were awesome. Great selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last Friday around 5:30 and were seated right away. The place is huge and pretty loud. I had the 3-piece cod fish fry and my boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich. Neither of us were terribly impressed. My sweet potato fries were very thin, more like shoe string potatoes. His pulled pork was pretty chewy, and I have a hard time believing it'd been cooked for 14 hours (it's called the 14-hour pulled pork, or something like that). The waitress brought him the wrong beer and I noticed I paid for the wrong stuff on final bill ($6 instead of the $4.50 for what he wanted) but I didn't bother trying to correct it. The menu had a lot of other interesting sandwiches I wouldn't mind trying if we come back. Maybe for lunch another time when it's cooler out and we can sit outside. The decor in the building was interesting, and I think they'd benefit from installing some sort of baffling (foam under the chairs or tables) to absorb some of the sound."}
{"text":"I just moved into the building and heard from multiple people that helped me move in that this place was great! So I was shocked to see that it has only been given a 3.5 star rating. 

I came here with a friend and we ordered the cheese curds and salmon sandwich. We sat at the bar and were promptly served our drinks as well as had them constantly refilled throughout our meal. The cheese curds i have to say, and my friend agrees, is one of, if not the best cheese curds in Madison. So it is a must try. The cheese is local and the batter thy put it in is amazing. Perfectly fried and ridiculously flavorful. The salmon sandwich is cooked medium which is awesome. It was juicy and their aioli was the perfect combination. I was surprised by the size of the sandwich when it came out and even more surprised when the bread was super soft! It's a definite must try especially if you love salmon and even more if you love sashimi since it is cooked medium so just be aware. 

Again to summarize, TLDR, this place is great. I read some of the other reviews and it seemed like people we're being hypercritical about the staff( which don't get me wrong is important, but I had great service) as the decor. But if you're talking about the food, everything was great and I'll definitely be back! 

9.7.16 Update on the review. I lowered my rating a bit because the last I went the food wasn't that great. The two aforementioned are still my absolute favorites and are definitely 5 stars, add on the veggie chili and you're solid. but i had the steak dinner and it was just okay. Same with the wallaye poboy. nothing too too special,but the staff is still wonderful and the environment is great.

CHEESE CURDS ARE STILL ON POINT. 

EAT AND ORDER LOTS :D"}
{"text":"I have been here two times now and I'm not very impressed with the food so far.
First time was for beers (good selection) but I ordered some pub chips as a snack. Oily, burnt, and unappetizing. The pepper flakes just made me feel ill.

The second time we had lunch. Two burgers and pork quesadilla. None of the meat seemed to be seasoned. Tex mex Burger was bland. The pork was well cooked and extremely tender, but lacked flavor. Our thought was that no or very little salt was used. The meal was definitely not worth the $50 spent. The burger alone was $13 and felt like a complete rip off.

They get 3 stars because the beer selection and staff have been nice."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and my whole family agrees this is a nice, independent addition to Monona's restaurant scene.  

We've tried the pulled pork sandwich, and the walleye sandwich, and both were really awesome, and huge.  The second time we stopped in on a Friday before heading to a show and we all got fish fries, two cod and one walleye.  And all three of us agreed they were the best fish fries we've had in the Madison area for a long time, and I'm a south side of Milwaukee fish fry snob.

The beer list is very well curated, with a lot of variety and constantly rotating taps.  They're also doing featured breweries which is fun.  I encourage you to take advantage of their sampling policy, I've found some awesome beers this way.

The space is really well done, very urban but also well blended with the waterfront surroundings.  The only thing I'd love to change is the view of the Beltline.  Ah well, can't have it all.

Try it, you'll enjoy it, an excellent interpretation of upscale bar food with an amazing bar.  

But I'll warn you, the sign is easy to spot off of Broadway in Monona, but it's not obvious that the restaurant is on the other side of the building, on the water, so once in the parking lot you have to wind your way down along the Treysta, right by the water's edge.  Lovely walk.  Hope they offer a place for kayakers to moor in the summer."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on our way through Madison.  It is not far off hwy151.  It was tucked in the back of an apartment building which was a little difficult to find.  We had to call the hostess to help find the place.

Once we were there the atmosphere was a bit noisy but the food and beer selection were above average."}
{"text":"First impression of Waypoint is somewhat mixed.  

Just finding the actual restaurant is a bit of a chore.  You can't even see the establishment from the parking lot, having to walk all the way down a sidewalk.  I understand that they wanted the outdoor seating area by the water. I get it. It also gets nice visibility from the Beltline.  But by getting that gorgeous view of traffic buzzing down the Beltline, it definitely made things a bit awkward.

Otherwise the interior is quite nice, with the exception of some questionable design choices.  That painted plywood with art tacked to it is, well, tacky.  There is hardwood everywhere in this place, and those benches are awesome.  I also like the lighting.  The bar is gigantic!  The outdoor seating is fine, but the view of the Beltline isn't ideal.  Positioning the restaurant near the parking lot with a quieter outdoor area would have made more sense.

The food we tried was very greasy.  I also feel like everything was over-charred.  A greasy burger that's been charred to death isn't exactly the awesomest.  A requested medium-rare Brie Burger was pretty overcooked.  My Sautéed Mushroom Sandwich was very greasy, and that bread was simply burnt.  It had a good mushroom flavor going on, but nothing else.  Instead of brie, goat cheese would work better.  The mushroom sandwich was just okay, and I'm not hurrying back for another.

You do get a side with your meal.  If you choose fries, you get a quite generous portion.  The prices were fair.

Service was okay.  The server tried really hard, but seemed a little unexperienced.  Slight mistake with giving my companion regular fries, when he ordered sweet potato fries.

They do have a good beer list, and that bar looks well-stocked.

The bathrooms are nice, but small considering how large this restaurant is.

The dinner menu seems safe and uninspired, but has the standards people want.  The brunch menu looks pretty good, and I'll probably check that out in the near future."}
{"text":"First visit to the Waypoint Public House.  Excellent food, great beer & drink selections. Family style tables, great atmosphere. Friendly wait staff.  The Garden Pesto Sandwich was excellent.  Homemade Pesto, grilled zucchini, tomato, and goat cheese... Served on grilled multi grain Batch House bread.  Hearty, flavorful without being greasy. Served with choice of fries, kettle chips or house salad.  The fries are excellent.   This is a great place to go with it group, or just stop by for lunch.

The only critique/suggestion that I would offer, would that they add better signage to help identify and direct patrons to the entrance... Had I not been meeting a group that had been here before, I may have just left... And that my friends, would have been a shame...  ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! This is usually dim lit and has a very comfortable vibe. Wide selection of craft brews and cocktails. I've been there 10-15 times and have always been pleased with their food. Tilapia tacos, cheese curds, and their poutine are definitely my favorites"}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming. The deviled eggs were good, but the sriracha was weirdly splattered about the plate. We ended up putting them on the eggs from the bottle.

Our sandwiches were just okay. They were lukewarm and nothing was that special about them. One of them came missing a main ingredient. (It's actually in the name of the sandwich, so this was kind of lame.) Our server brought out the missing element on a plate and we threw it in the sandwich. It was a little odd. It would have been better if they just made a new sandwich properly.

Service was good - friendly, attentive server."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a spot like Waypoint in our neighborhood!  I would call my husband and myself 'regulars' up until I got pregnant last year!  We've still been back for a couple drinks, and breakfast a few times - I am especially a fan of their Tenderloin Poutine - but honestly, I really haven't had anything bad there yet!  The service is time and time again above my expectations, especially for how busy they can get!  We loved going to this place so much, that after our wedding at the Capitol - we dragged our friends and family there for lunch!  Yes, there's so many wonderful places to eat downtown, but we really wanted to show off this new gem (2015 at the time) in our neck of the woods - it was such a breath of fresh air after feeling for years that there were really limited options in the Monona area, unless you wanted to visit a chain.  It seems like they really started a trend of bringing lots of great dining options to the area!  When we do still get to visit...we like to go early because it gets crazy in there!"}
{"text":"Stopped for eat prior to driving back to Minnesota. Sunday Brunch was on the menu which was delicious across the board. No kids menu but the waitress said they would make whatever we requested for the little one.

Coffee is served with sugar cubes and cream. The breakfast potatoes are delicious. 

Atmosphere was lovely and relaxing. Plenty of space. Portions were generous and everyone left with a smile on their face and a full stomach."}
{"text":"I've been dying to find a cool restaurant on the water and this one makes the cut!

The ambiance is amazing, and it has the coolest wrap-around bar I have ever seen. We weren't able to sit outdoors, but the patio is gorgeous! It's located right over the lake so you can watch all the fishermen and kayaks go out on their journeys! 

We went for brunch and got their Yahara Bay Bloody Mary and the Salty Dog - both were delicious! For food, we got the veggie benedict and huevos rancheros. Both of the meals were decent, but were a little cold when they came out. 

Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fairly priced meal on the water!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place - great location (for me at least), lots of taps - but our first visit here had some bumps, and I hope by posting them, maybe things will improve. Went last Tuesday to meet family to celebrate a birthday. We were the 2nd of three groups to arrive. The first already had drinks. We joined them and sat for about 15 minutes before anyone came by and got our drink order. I thought \"maybe they were busier than they could handle.\" Waitress was very nice. Everyone else arrived, we ordered food. The menu looked very interesting - lots of good options - I got the Hot Italian Sandwich. It sounded so much better than it tasted. Had no balance, all you could taste was the pepperoni (maybe it was the salami) - spicy meat, which I love, but it needed ham or tomato or something. Again my drink was empty, and their was a long wait before anyone came back. Shouldn't have been that way on a Tuesday night when they weren't that full. 

That said, I got the feeling that I would eventually like the place. Nice bar area, nice open dining area, nice outdoor patio. Lots of other menu items to try. The staff seemed really nice - maybe they are just working out the process or someone called in that night. I will definitely come back and try again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Beautiful location on the water! I got the steak tacos and it was a TON of food and very delicious. My friend also really enjoyed his burger. It was a weekday so not very busy and we got quick service. They seemed to have a fun drink menu and bar but couldn't try it out today. Will have to come back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch during spring. Has a great outdoor patio and was able to accommodate our larger group (~7 people). Food and drinks were good. Service was attentive but not overbearing. Our orders took slightly longer than expected but could have been due to our large group or some custom orders. Overall would go back again, especially on a nice day."}
{"text":"BEST CHEESE CURDS IN MADISON!!!  (Monona counts)

The rest of the menu is hit or miss, which often happens with a diverse menu.  Veggie chili was good, a little sweet for my taste, but I would order again (especially at $3/cup $5/bowl).  The veggie pesto sandwich was only grilled on one side, leaving the shredded, bagged cheese unmelted and cold.  The side of tossed greens didn't have enough dressing.  I also tried the cole slaw (average) and sweet potato fries (above average).  I welcome the challenge of finding the \"order again\" items off of the menu."}
{"text":"I come here very frequently, and my family members come here even more. Staff behind the bar is super nice and very attentive and knowledgeable. I love tap list at the Waypoint. It is one thing to have a lot of beers on tap, but it is quite another thing to have a good VARIETY of good beers on tap - the Waypoint accomplishes all of these things. I've never liked the food here, unfortunately. Owners have plenty of restaurants in the area that do incredible food, but something about the Waypoint's food is simply underwhelming (with the exception of the cheese curds! They rival those of the Old Fashioned for sure). I've certainly eaten here plenty of times, but it is simply not my choice if the main reason I'm going out is for food. That said, definitely come for the beer, the atmosphere, and the service. Very neat interior space and a great outdoor space looking out on the water. A good spot for groups and going solo. 

Wheelchair accessible (entrance, eating area, bathrooms) although parking can be a challenge if you need disabled parking. Definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Good food.  Lots of brunch potatoes that were yummy.  Side salad had a very light and fresh dressing.  Bloody Maria was very tasty.  Not a fan of the shared seating."}
{"text":"A solid place to go with co-workers for a drink/bite after work. Good menu options and the view of the lake doesn't hurt. I went when they weren't even too busy yet but it took 10 minutes for the server to take my initial order. The atmosphere isn't unique enough to want to take good friends or family."}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry
Clam chowder was tasty, but too peppery, solid clam chunks (largest ever) with potatoes and carrots. Fried cod was tasty and cooked perfect. French fries were thin and great. Others with me enjoyed the sweet potato fries and the baked cod. The beer sampling was nice, quite a variety."}
{"text":"From Arizona went out for Friday fish fry awesome walleye beautiful atmosphere food perfect I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"The food was incredible! The service was even better. What a great experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it is consistently good.  We have tried many items on the menu and have all been very good.  I recently had the fish tacos and while they were good, I probably wouldn't order them again.  Only because I have had better fish tacos elsewhere.  I love their veggie burger.  It is the perfect amount of hot and has good flavor.  The fries are delicious as well.  They have a great beer selection and an interesting cocktail menu.  Full bar for getting your \"usual\" if desired.  Great outdoor seating area in the summer and the inside is very nice too."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  Nice ambiance and good drink/beer selection. The deviled egg sandwich is highly recommended, and both the regular and sweet potato fries were decent. The walleye sandwich looked just fabulous, but it definitely wasn't. The walleye had no walleye flavor whatsoever.  It could have been anything deep fried and thrown on that sandwich. Will probably come again to hang at the bar."}
{"text":"Who would know there is a restaurant here? There isn't much signage and you really can't see it from the road but it's a great place. It's next to the Rutabaga  paddle shop in that big apartment complex. The boat launch is on the right side of it. Nice view of the water way and a comfortable bright bar area. The bar, is a huge L shaped one that has plenty of room. The dining area is fairly big too. The sandwiches are very good and lots of beers on tap.I had never heard of the place until this week and plan to return. Stop in if you are on the belt line. Just look for the boat launch, which can be seen from the bar area once you're in there. Just a small glass door with a sign, thats it. Don't miss."}
{"text":"The Waypoint Public House is wonderful. The view from the back patio is spectacular. The food is very delicious and flavorful. My reason for a 4-star instead of 5 is because the sangria had mint in it which made it a little hard to drink. The server was very accommodating to my dietary needs. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every Time I go here I love it more! Service is spot on, food is crazy good, and beer beer beer! Not sure about the low stars, they deserve 5. Love the pulled pork quesadilla, buffalo chicken wrap, the walleye is out of this world, and the cheese curds are the best in the city. Yes, the best. Great gem to Monona!"}
{"text":"Been there several times for drinks after work.  Great bar - bartenders are top flight - can get rather noisy but good overall buzz.  Had some apps last night and the shredded pork quesadillas were terrific!  More like a meal so share!"}
{"text":"Food is a solid 3.5 for this great neighborhood spot. Water views and great service made this a great stop after a paddle at Rutabega. Poutine with pork ternderloin was  great. House made potato chips are spicy but good. Solid list of beers on tap with many local choices."}
{"text":"Taps!  East side!  Perfect.

I was super excited that this place was opening since I just relocated to the east side from Fitchburg and was experiencing withdrawal from the Flying Hound.  I've been here several times now and the bartenders and staff have always been very friendly and helpful.  They will give you multiple samples so you can find something you love.  They have the Duchesse and Tripel Karmeleit on tap, and always have some dark options for folks like me.  The bar area is spacious.  

Their food menu isn't extensive, but they do have some treats like Tenderloin Poutine.  Cheese curds have a tasty, black pepper-y batter.  Tilapia tacos are great.  Portion sizes are reasonable and food has always arrived quickly.

Very pleased with Waypoint so far!"}
{"text":"Great pub, ENORMOUS beverage lists for wine, beer, cocktails. Several big screens for watching the game. Good food...limited but tasty menu
. Great service..friendly, engaging waitresses. Took us quite a while and couple of calls to locate the bar after we got into the parking lot...there's a sign on the marquee but none we could see on the building. down the walk beside the apartment building facing the Water."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant/pub for lunch on Sunday.  First thing we noticed - it was very noisy both outside because of the belt line and inside because of the high ceiling, metal chairs and families with kids.
I had the Mexican egg dish and it was not good.  The tortillas were swimming in grease and mushy.  It was topped with about a cup of sour cream and a sliced avocado.  Way too much sour cream.  The salsa was pretty tasteless.
My husband had the eggs Benedict and wasn't empressed.  Potatoes were too spicy.  The mgr did not charge for my dinner.  
I was scouting for a lunch place for a group of ladies, but we won't be going here."}
{"text":"Offspring #2 and I popped in one rainy late afternoon after a titch of difficulty finding this nifty \"hidden\" gem! The location is on the ground level of Treysta on the Water, with the entrance nearest the water's edge. Added note: park in the lot to the left, after exiting Monona Drive. We came because of the excellent recommendation I'd gotten on the craft beer selection: Offspring ordered the Lake Louie Milk Stout, I ordered the O'Hara's Irish Stout...niiiiice! We ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and WOW! They packed a heated punch (Offspring tells me I'm weak, as he was not as affected by it)!! Offspring had the Steak Taco with an order of sweet potatoe fries and I ordered the Tilapia Taco. The Steak Taco had good flavor and was plentiful in size, the fries were tastey enough and too many to finish. The Tilapia Taco was good but I've yet to find the \"perfect\" fish taco...I realize this might only be found in my head, but I'm still on the quest. Service was fair for not many patrons. I'm curious about the patio as the traffic from the Beltline was quite visible, which seems like it could detract from the overall coolness of sitting at the water's edge...which only means, I'll be back to sample that with a cold beer in-hand!!"}
{"text":"We came in for brunch. I was a little disappointed in the menu. They didn't have a kids menu or at least something simple the kids would enjoy. Thankfully they agreed to just make some scrambled eggs and a side of toast. 
The wait for food was absolutely ridiculous. Over an hour, and with 4 kids it was pretty miserable. Our only saving grace was the weather was nice so they could go outside by the water. 
The food tasted really good. I had the French toast and bacon (the bacon could have been cooked a little longer though) and the breakfast potatoes were really good. 
I'm really impressed with the waiter, he gave us 50% off of our bill because of the long wait which is why I'm going this place a 4 instead of the 2 or maybe 3 i would have given because of the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 9:45 last night for food. The server politely informed us the kitchen was closing at 10. As someone who worked in a restaurant for years I know how frustrating last minute food orders can be but the server gave no pressure and I appreciated that. Wasn't too hungry so just had the tomato basil soup and it was delicious. Creamy, fresh, chunky and flavorful but not overly salty. If I lived In the area I would definitely be back to try the spinach and artichoke burger, it sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great! First time here and I'd def go back! Awesome rustic decor and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews of this place....... Subpar food with a spectacular  craft beer list.  We had high hopes because McFarland and surrounding has few decent restaurants.  We were hoping for a Gates and Brovi like location, or at least a Great Dane, but felt it was more like the food was an afterthought put out to justify calling it a public house.

We had the Reuben which had good bread but was otherwise pre-processed and unimpressive, a salad that was very basic and the Wayfair Parmesan chips, which were surprisingly good.  Our daughter had the kids' chicken tenders and fries which were good as well but what you can get at any restaurant.  They didn't even have the kids' menu printed so we had to ask and they said they have the usual stuff on a kids menu, no further explanation.  The service was slow and obviously our waiter was distracted.  The menu overall was unimpressive bar food consisting of sandwiches, burgers and salads, with a huge drink menu.  

If you are going for a drink, I highly recommend it, but for dinner steer clear.  Madison is chock full of great places to eat, but this isn't one of them.  We won't return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, I love the atmosphere, service and voice of food, and not to mention the great beer selection with their out door seating!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for brunch. The main negative was that it wasn't well-marked where the restaurant actually is from where you park (it's on the first floor of one of the apartment buildings). We ended up walking the wrong way at first by Rutabaga and then looked on google maps to course correct. 

The food was very good. I got the huevos rancheros - maybe my new favorite huevos rancheros in Madison! Everything tasted very fresh - the peppers, pico, etc. My avocado was perfectly ripe and it was at least half an avocado. Personally I think they should either leave the shredded cheese off or melt it. Breakfast potatoes were also delicious (though I ended up taking most home because the huevos were so filling!). My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and said it was good, nothing special but it's a pretty standard option. Coffee was only okay. Another thing we appreciated was the giant water glasses!

We sat on the patio; nice spot. Inside also seemed nice. I'm excited to come back to try dinner here some time!"}
{"text":"Since our first 3 star visit we've been back 4 times (and we plan to visit again on Father's Day).   We've tried different dishes every time.   We've visited with friends and with family at lunch and at dinner time.  Our guests have been satisfied.    We've sat indoors and outdoors.   Our experience has been good every time.   Food has been consistently good and service has been fine.   The rotating beer list is always interesting.   The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing.   Waypoint will be on our short list when we're going out."}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for four days and we've been here twice, so there must be something good about it. 

The first time was convenience. We arrived fairly late from MSN and needed a beer after one of those annoying travel days. They stop serving dinner at 10pm, but they have a fairly decent late-night food menu that they serve until closing. The beer list is excellent, and the bartender was helpful in selecting a brew that would help us forget the travel disasters we had already encountered. They have a nice selection with a good variety of breweries and types. 

We ordered the nachos, cheese curds, and deviled eggs. While the deviled eggs were delicious and the cheese curds were pretty good, the nachos were terrible. I might not go so far as to say the worst nachos I've ever had, but definitely in the running. However, it really was my mistake for ordering nachos so far from Mexico. 

The second time we came back with a friend and had the deviled egg sandwich, burger, and ABLT. All were really tasty, the fries were crispy, and everything tasted fresh and delicious. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to deal with several special requests and substitutions (and everything came out right!). 

I'm only here for a few more days and I try not to duplicate restaurants while traveling, but I can't promise anything."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying finally, something a little upscale in Monona! I love my craft beer, Way point has a great selection that rotates. Now their Friday fish fry blew my mind. I had a \"best in town\" fish fry joint not to far from there heading toward McFarland, most people know which establishment I'm referring to, but Way point trumped them. I look forward to going this friday to hit up some craft and some fish!!"}
{"text":"BEST CHEESE CURDS IN MADISON!!!

I walked into this place, and I was not expecting what I got. Generally, I find care attached to apartment complexes to be general run-of-the-mill style restaurants. The Waypoint Public House sure surprised me! The atmosphere is spot-on, and often my crowded (although that's bound to change soon enough). Additionally, the cheese curds here are truly something to go out of your way for. With the right amount of cheese-bread ratio AND a spectacular dipping sauce, I would come back here again and again. Don't pass this one up!"}
{"text":"I'm on a few food spirit quests at the moment. You know, as one does...  One quest is to find the best veggie burger in town. 

We have a contender!

The Five Bean Veggie Burger, let's talk about it:
Homemade veggie patty- These are tricky, so lets start with the critiques- Needed more flavor in general. Something more acid and savory would really liven it up. Call me crazy, but yeast extracts might do this wonders- mess around with adding some marmite. Overall, good texture. Did not fall apart immediately. Toppings paired well and weren't too slidey (you know when you get a sandwich that just slides around, that's the worst, this was not that). Good construction and very yummy to eat.

And included: avocado (nature's mayo) + jalapeno cream (Nature's other mayo. flavorful, but not too spicy) + arugula (the king of the lettuces) + tomato + pickled onion (it's like onion but extra) + Batch bun (soft, but sturdy)

The restaurant may be on the bottom floor of a high-rise apartment, but it's very open and has lots of windows and natural light. They also have a huge and cool bar. I would come back."}
{"text":"My experience with Waypoint was good - I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but the food didn't leave me excited enough to recommend it next time we're hunting for a dinner spot.

We went on a rainy and cold May night. While we did snag a decent parking space, you still have to walk around almost to the opposite side of the building to get to the Waypoint entrance. Bring an umbrella if it's raining or drop off anyone with mobility issues at the curb. 

We were able to be seated immediately and got a booth near the entrance. From the little bit of the restaurant I could see decorations looked nice. Our booth was high-backed so you've got some privacy, but you are quite close to the booth across the walkway. They keep the lighting very, very dim, so that helps create more of a feeling that you aren't dining with the people across the way - there's maybe three to four feet between the rows.

The beer list had some really good finds, but unfortunately the beer that rang my bell (a nitro red velvet) had blown and wasn't available. There were a couple others that sounded fun but they were super high ABVs and almost as pricy as my dinner so I decided to forego a second choice. They do allow you to taste anything before you order a full glass which I appreciate. 

For my meal I went for the 14-Hour Pulled Pork sandwich. The pork itself had a good flavor, but it was lost in the balloon of bun. I love Batch and I usually prefer less meat than more, but the ratio was just off. At first I didn't know how I felt about the arugula but it actually added a nice contrasting texture. The Carolina sauce was very runny - after cutting into my sandwich it pooled on the plate. I was expecting a mustard sauce but it was more vinegar based. The fries were average. 

Since I struck out on the beer we were considering dessert but there wasn't any listed on the menu and the server didn't mention it as an option when picking up our dishes. Service overall was good but having multiple servers walk up the row of booths darting their heads back and forth every 3-5 minutes made me anxious. Upside: if we had needed anything it would have been easy to flag someone.

A fine experience all around that's worth giving it another go when the weather warms up.

Things I will have to go back for: patio seating, cheese curds, and the red velvet nitro if they get it back on the line."}
{"text":"extremely rude. No service. Ignored..  treated poorly.  Not a large selection of food."}
{"text":"We had just finished running a relay from Chicago to Madison and needed to eat!  We picked Waypoint Public House based on the Yelp reviews and were NOT disappointed.  This was the perfect spot for us!

We were a party of 15, and the wait was short and they easily handled our large party with collecting our orders timely, getting our food delivered correctly, and refilling our drinks and condiments quickly!  And we even had a waterfront view.  

We tried several different appetizers, salads and sandwiches.  Everyone left stuffed and happy with their choices.  I had the poutine, the avocado salad and the buffalo cauliflower.  So good!  I also tried the artichoke dip which was amazing!    The nachos with the brisket were fantastic!  Overall, nothing was just average.  It was all tasty!

We were driving a huge 15 passenger van, and we found parking quickly that was convenient to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the very best! My husband and I live nearby and enjoy eating here often. Yummy Pork Quesadillas. Pork is also good on the sandwich. Always great service and the atmosphere is really cool. Outside seating when it is nice outside, right off the water, is special. Enjoyable and relaxing and worth every penny and drink and drop :)"}
{"text":"Five stars for beer list, atmosphere and service, two stars for the food.  I really liked the layout of the place, and always love a restaurant with outside seating.  Hard to beat the beer list, and it looks like they are adding more to their selection soon.  Would be a great spot to meet friends for drinks if you're in Monona.

The food, I did not enjoy.  I am going to try their salads if I return, because they did look good.  I split the walleye sandwich and sauteed mushroom sandwich with my dad.  The mushroom sandwich was just sauteed mushrooms thrown in between two slices of very buttered/greasy bread.  Not very inspiring and would not order again.  They need to make it a more flavorful dish, not just buttered mushrooms (which is all I tasted).  The walleye sandwich was really greasy and just not very good flavor.  I did not like the sauce that was served with it, either.  My dad really liked the kettle chips, but I didn't try them.  

Kind of bummed I didn't like the food, because the menu looked so fantastic. But I would still recommend checking this place out, and will hopefully go back and order a salad."}
{"text":"Solid brunch choice. Started out with a few cocktails. They were more than generous on the pour. Had eggs Benedict which was pretty good. Only complaint was the eggs were slightly overdone. But I was still satisfied with the dish. Breakfast potatoes were delicious. Girlfriend enjoyed the pork belly sandwich. All in all it was a good experience. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Yes, it was our first time.  Not sure your adding any ingredients to deep fried chicken tenders.  Those come off the Sysco truck just like the fries and pineapple juice.  You don't have a kids menu so we didn't know we were going to get soaked $9.00 for 2 burnt chicken tenders, 18 fires, and 3 oz of pineapple juice until we got the bill.  I can pay the same for food at Graze and be blown away.  Your food was just meh."}
{"text":"The cocktails were really just fruit juice or soda, I am convinced they left out the alcohol.  The pub chips were cooked too much and there was an abundance of cheese in the middle of the pub chips. I also want to add that there are straight up chili flakes in the cheese so be careful if you do not like a lot of spice.  I ordered the grilled cheese which came with tomato soup.  I don't know if there was too much cheese in my sandwich but it was also cold and greasy.  The first couple bites were good, but then it just got to be too much.  The tomato soup was super chunky, not bad tasting, but an odd texture for tomato soup.  I ended up just eating half the sandwich and having a few spoonfuls of the soup.  The location is on the water with a clear view of the freeway.  We sat inside because there were no seats outside and it gets loud inside. It was almost too loud to have a conversation without straining to talk and hear your tablemate.  Waypoint is a nice restaurant to check out if you are in the area but the food/service/atmosphere isn't spectacular."}
{"text":"We love this place!  No idea why it doesn't have 5 stars - I think others may be over-critiquing the place.  It is really one of a kind in Monona area.  Things I love:

The draught beer list - amazing
Pulled pork Mac and cheese - get it.
The summer cocktails - salted coconut daiquiri!!
Chicken avocado salad - so fresh and all the right ingredients 
Fish sandwich was also good
Burgers - very good

We've been maybe 6-8 times already because we're so glad they're in the neighborhood.  You can watch the games, but the tvs are not overbearing like at sports bars.  The atmosphere is vintage modern: love the lighting and decor.  Servers have been learning, but well trained and attentive.  We've brought our newborn in a few times and they're very courteous having a baby there (where not many babies seem to go). It's mostly a young adult scene.

The only thing I was not a fan of was the jalapeño poppers.  They are interesting, but not fried like we expected.  Just not my thing.  

Everything else is good and we hope they stay in business a long time!"}
{"text":"We got hungry while boating and decided to try waypoint. The food was great and very reasonable price points. I had the Brie burger, so delicious! If you are a fan of spicy try the jalapeño appetizer. 
I would love to come back here for dinner and sit out on the patio! It's a nice addition to the neighborhood and perfect for enjoying the scenery."}
{"text":"Great place. Stopped in this summer for a couple of beers and have been wanting to come back for a meal. We did that today and so glad we did! Great beer selection. The decor and atmosphere is wonderful. Had the Badger game on and they were winning, so that always helps!

The food was great! We started with an order of cheese curds and they were outstanding. A nice light and well seasoned breading. One of our friends with us said they just became his favorite curds. Husband and I both had the special of the day: pulled pork tacos. The tacos were overfilled with delicious smoked pulled pork, pickled onions, pineapple salsa and a cream sauce drizzle. So tasty! 

We'll be back for sure. Want to try more from the menu and maybe one of their craft cocktails. Get here now!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I love Waypoint, it's one of our favorite spots! The serving staff are amazing and very engaging with the customers. You can tell as a patron that the servers are friends and really enjoy working together. 

They have a great drink selection and a fabulous sangria! They also have specialty drinks from time to time like spicy pepper margaritas on cinco de mayo!

The food is delicious, steak tacos were amazing and we have tried sandwiches, salads, and appetizers here too, it's always great food. They've got a nice patio to sit outside and relax in the summer and we love the atmosphere. We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all.

First came here when it first opened. Literally everything that came out of the kitchen was wrong. Burger underdone, wrong side, wrong everything. They were very nice and corrected it. Took a while... but corrected the order. Food was so so.. nothing special. Service was slow but they corrected everything. Gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were new and working out kinks so gave them another try a few months later.

This time around our server seemed to be running around with her head cut off. Short staffed? New? Not sure... but it was ugly. She rushed to get our order from us and seemed annoyed. Not a good impression. The food came out very quickly and was meh... I got the brisket sandwich which was very dry. My side of fries were ice cold. I didn't complain because I didn't want to piss off our server even more. 

Overall, I won't be back.

Good luck."}
{"text":"This is a great place on Lake Monona. It overlooks the beltline, but somehow the noise of the traffic becomes background noise while you are dining on their nice patio area. It was fun to sit out on their patio on a sunny day watching the kayaks and boats venturing to and fro. The patio was quite full and they were able to accommodate some larger groups as well as a lot of smaller tables. This was Sunday, so they serve their Sunday brunch items (special menu) until 2pm. Then their kitchen is closed until the normal menu starts up at 3pm. We were mostly there for the view, so we opted for drinks on the patio with a view. The plates coming out to other tables looked really good though. I will need to stop back for some food next time. This is conveniently located so I'm sure I'll be back to eat. The prices for both food and drinks were pretty affordable and the portion sizes looked good. This would be a great place to order a couple things off the menu and then share with your dining companion(s)."}
{"text":"I've been to Waypoint Public House (WPH) several times now and while I have some minor gripes, I have no problem recommending the place for a drink (or two) and a meal.  I'm a fan of the generally well-prepared meals, the cordial service and I appreciate a new local option for waterfront dining.

While WPH is easy to spot from the Beltline, it is rather inconspicuous when attempting to access the restaurant from West Broadway.  It also is a long walk from the parking lot to the back of the building complex that houses WPH.  It's not bad when the weather is pleasant, but less enjoyable during inclement weather.

When you enter the restaurant, the ginormous three sided bar immediately catches your eye.  In addition to the 30 craft beers on tap, the bar also features an extensive selection of Scotch, bourbon, rum, rye and scotch.  The interior features a mix of rustic looking woods and more modern looking stainless steel.  The interior can get extremely loud when the place fills up due to the concrete floor that does little to absorb the sound. There also is an outdoor seating area along the edge of the Yahara River, though that view is somewhat dominated by the bridge spanning Mud Lake.

I've encountered efficient and generally friendly service during my various visits to WPH.  Orders are taken in a timely manner, wait times for the food are minimal and the check is always delivered as the meal is winding down.  My only service gripe is the host stand, which rarely seems to be occupied.  I've encountered times where I waited over five minutes for the host to come and escort me to a table.

The menu offers a variety of appetizer, burgers, sandwiches and a handful of entrees.  The hand breaded cheese curds tasted fresh, but were a tad greasy.  The poutine was just OK, I enjoyed the robust gravy, but I was less enthused with the generic yellow mustard added to the beef tenderloin.  The tenderloin was well prepared, but to portions were too large to comfortably chew.

I've had better success with the sandwich menu.  WPH gets a big thumbs up for using bread from Batch Bakehouse, so the bread component is always spot on.  For those that need gluten free sandwich options, WPH offers Silly Yak gluten free bread for a $2 upcharge.  All sandwiches come with a choice of French fries, house kettle chips, coleslaw, or tossed greens.

The Hot Italian Sandwich (pancetta, prosciutto, pepperoni, salami, Swiss, tomato, pickled onion, pepperoncini, Italian dressing, Batch baguette) was a treat to eat.  The kitchen up a wonderful sear on the meat and the added pepper provided a delightful crunch.  My kitchen also deserves props for obtaining that perfect balance between the bread and the contents.
During another visit, I ordered the grilled cheese with sautéed mushrooms and spinach.  The deeply browned bread offered a pleasing crunch with every bite.  With a plethora of cheeses available in the heart of America's Dairyland, I thought the use of a plain Jane American and Pepper jack cheese were an odd choice.  Fortunately, the sautéed mushrooms saved the day, providing a mouthful of flavor in every bite.  The sandwich also benefited from the rustic roasted vegetable soup that accompanied my meal and served as a fantastic dipping sauce.  The chunky soup featured a dash of heat and balanced flavors. 

Despite some minor flaws, WPH is another fine addition to the Madison dining scene.  While I don't get there as often as I would like, I have always come away from my visits satisfied with the pub food and the efficient service."}
{"text":"Is it a 3 or 4 star? IDK. Service was ok -- we had 4 different people bringing us drinks and food. On an evening when, by the host's own assessment they were \"not that busy,\" we waited 10 minutes for drinks but only another 5 for the food. And my cider came in a bottle -- I had to ask for a glass. Nothing against those of you who like to drink from a bottle, for sure. But if I'm paying $5 for a cider, at least ask me if I'd like a glass. Food was good, solid 4 out of 5. Total bill we was $40 for two of us, as usual. Glad to know it's here. Won't rush back but wouldn't avoid it, either."}
{"text":"This place would have a Great Lake  view \"in theory\" however, you are staring at the beltline the whole time. No matter, the service is great, always with a smile, and food is delicious! Try the popular Deviled Egg sandwich. Yes it's $10, however the bread is excellent, the flavors that mash together just make a high quality, filling sandwich. Definitely opt for a dipping sauce for fries or chips when offered!"}
{"text":"Probably the best food on the water! Slips are extremely shallow that's the only negative :-)"}
{"text":"As nearby Monona residents We have been meaning to visit.....finally got our chance today (7/16).  It was everything we were hoping for in a Monona restaurant......great decor, simple yet enticing menu and a great beer and liquor selection. hacker pschorr hefe weisse and buffalo trace bourbon kept the adults occupied until dinner arrived.

Our dinner was for two adults and a 5 year old....the adults had the ABLT and the fish tacos (both would be ordered again). The 5 year old had the cheeseburger (all topping on the side) and he ate it all.   Everyone left with full bellies and a desire to return.  So happy to have you in town. 

We will definitely be back and encourage our neighbors and friends to visit.."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and man is this place hard to find. Signage could be much improved. So could the welcome--hostess was peeved for no apparent reason. Sorry lady--not everyone likes the high tops. But the service, once seated, and the food, was excellent. I had the pulled pork quesadilla and friend had a Reuben and we shared cheese curds. The curds are 10 of 10. Only complaint about environment is the noise level. Will be so glad when restaurant designers get over this idea that a happenin' place has to be NOISY."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! Love the outdoor seating, delicious drinks and we were both pleased with our meals. We had the Salmon Sandwich which the coleslaw and the tilapia tacos with a salad. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Like the other reviews have said, it is a little bit of a pain to get there, but if you know that ahead of time and plan for it, it's really not too bad. We went on a Saturday night a little after 6 and were seated right away on the patio- although when we were leaving the place was MUCH more crowded- in fact, there was quite the jam up at the door with all of the people coming in crowded around the hostess stand while others were trying to leave.  They definitely need to do a little re-arranging in this area. The decor is nice- definitely the typical metal/wood industrial look with a huge bar. As a previous reviewer noted, the painted plywood walls with unframed art tacked on was the only thing that really didn't fit- it makes the place look unfinished. 

So we ate on the outdoor patio, which was extremely loud, both due to traffic noise from the beltline and the people around us all shouting to be heard over it. Plus the tables/chairs/umbrella base combo on the outdoor tables force you to have to sit really far back from the table (because there is nowhere to put your feet/legs underneath and the chairs lean pretty far back), so I think people were all talking loudly because they were so far from their dinner companions.  Because of the construction, parts of the Yahara were blocked off, which led to a giant stagnant, disgusting pool of water with a THICK layer of gunk on top- not especially appetizing to look at while you're eating. Hopefully this will be better once the construction is done, but I think I would try dining indoors next time. 

Anyway, on to the food.  They have a great selection of beers on tap, and the cheese curds were pretty decent. My husband had the walleye po' boy and really liked it. I had the Pressed Pesto and it was also very good.  We both had the fries, which were greasy, but also very tasty.  Service was decent and the prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Waypoint a number of times as it's close to work. Most visits I'd say are about three stars; the food is usually subpar and leaves me craving something else. However, I was here just last night and can't rave about the food enough! 

Oh boy, let's start with their spinach artichoke dip. It's now at the top of the list, just behind Luigi's. Then, let's move on to their five bean vegetarian burger. First of all, anytime I get a vegetarian burger that's homemade, I'm happy. But this burger was homemade and great. The arugula and jalapeño cream sauce was delicious on top. Finally, the crispy, crunch fries were hard to put down. Yes, yes, yes to everything! 

On top of great food, we had a super nice waitress. I believe her name was Sage. She was super friendly and took off our tasty appetizer simply because it came out too close to our meal. (We didn't even notice!) 

I'll definitely be back and will gladly give the restaurant five stars as soon as I know this tasty meal wasn't a fluke or that my tastebuds were being over zealous from eating nothing but broccoli the whole day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our date night last weekend and the food was amazing!!!! We had the poutine which is fries gravy and cheese, it was also topped with slices of tenderloin, the atmosphere was very laid back, we will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We visited this spot for a fundraiser recently, but it wasn't our first time. We ordered a couple of their breakfast cocktails: the Bloody Mary and the Eye Opener. Both were great and I'd recommend them. The bloody was not thick (which I prefer) and had a touch of heat and tang that I suspect came from pickle juice or citrus, possibly both. They have a really nice tap beer selection as well. Then we ordered 2 appetizers (cheese curds & poppers-not deep fried!) and split a burger. We both agreed everything was really good and would be back again sooner if it wasn't so far from where we live. In the past we've ordered their brunch steak & eggs and their pork belly sandwiches- outstanding! Also one of the few places in town (oddly enough) where you can sit on the water."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time the other night and the service was terrible. I had to ask about getting a glass of water 3 times. My burger was under cooked and the service was just not up to par. The only saving grace was the server asked what we were out celebrating and bought my drink. I don't know if I will go back."}
{"text":"I'd do 3.5 stars if I could. Loved the Malbec at $7. My man loves the massive tap beer selection. Food is just a click above average. We had the veg chili which had some heat to it and perhaps was a bit too think and mushy, as though it sat cooking too long. The steak tacos left us looking for the meat. What I don't get and hurt the experience for both of us was all the TVs with Viceland for our viewing pleasure. Some of the images were disturbing (numerous automatic weapons and people with gunshot wounds) and the female characters were portrayed as weak, naive objects. Lots of dudes here and there will be more with this atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing! They have great breakfast options and also large portions."}
{"text":"Hard to find its in the 1st floor of apartment complex. Quick service and food came out fast. Fish tacos and veggie burger were good. Lots of beer options. Sat outside on patio and had a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"while the menu is interesting, the policy for seating is absolutely ridiculous. You have customers wanting to order food and drinks, a party of 7 happy hour ladies, 4 of us standing around, plenty of open tables and told that there is not the possibility for us to sit down and order anything until the entire party is here. Do they understand the beltline traffic during the week? Just lost our business!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view, even inside, as plenty of windows allow for lots of light. A varied, yet reasonably priced tap selection. Very good cheese curds - lightly battered and well seasoned. The Batch bakery buns are a plus, and their smashed/breakfast potatoes are a standout."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. Owner was nice and attentive. Poutine was delicious, as well as the walleye sandwich. Decent beer tap selection. Would go again and recommend!"}
{"text":"I'd give Waypoint a 3.5 if I could. Came in for lunch. My friend and I did a mix & match with our sandwiches so I got half of the egg salad sandwich and half of the walleye po boy. 

The egg salad was delicious. Very flavorful and fresh. They had a nice multi-grain bread that was lightly toasted. Top it off with a piece of bacon, how could you go wrong. My only issue is there wasn't very much egg salad on the sandwich. I did not enjoy the walleye po boy as much. The fish was bland and had no flavor. The bread wasn't crispy, like you'd expect in a po boy. It was also dry and didn't have any aioli or other sauce to bring everything to life. And I did get a couple bones in the walleye, which was unpleasant. 

Overall, it was a decent lunch. I'll be back but will be cautious about what I order."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I don't know how you can screw up a fish fry in Wisconsin but waypoint found a way. Tasteless walleye with tasteless sauce. My wife's brisket tacos had a peanut sauce that made them unpalatable. Drinks were unsurprisingly poor. The seared tuna appetizer was subpar and saved only by the brined cucumber. The only shining light is the service which was excellent. The only reason for any stars at all."}
{"text":"Great view. Service was good. But the food was hit or miss. Cheese curds were good. The charred jalapeño poppers were a miss. The cream cheese was bland and the jalapeños were really hot. I like hot food, I'm from Arizona! But we did not enjoy them. We ordered 2 different margaritas and didn't really enjoy them either. I ordered the honey chile and didn't taste either flavor. Our sandwiches were a hit. We ordered a grilled cheese, the Italian and the walleye poboy. Fries were decent. I had the salad instead of the fries. It came dressed with a house dressing. I couldn't  decide what kind though. I would go back for the sandwiches and the view."}
{"text":"Overall, I loved my food and we had great service. I really wanted Waypoint to be 5 stars because of its gastropub feel, but it missed the mark on a few things that made it seem tacky.

We went for brunch on Sunday and were happy to score a high-top table near the bar to watch some tennis that was on the TV. The space is inviting and overlooks the water, with the beltline in the background. They have an outdoor seating area that I would imagine is pretty cozy in the summer.

The bar area is cute in some ways (the actual bar itself, wooden chairs that look artisan) and unorganized in others (3 different kinds of high top chairs, drinks in huge Coca Cola tumblers). For bigger events and weekend nights, I bet this place brings in a fun crowd.

Our waitress, Tia, was excellent and around just enough without smothering us. She also helped us decide on our entrees, Huevos Rancheros for me and French Toast for my friend. The Huevos were great! I got the salsa on the side because it said it was spicy, but I ended up using the whole cup. Most entrees come with a salad or potatoes and the salads are quite big with a really tasty champagne dressing. They also have some interesting entrees for brunch like Walleye and Eggs.

Overall, we had a pretty great breakfast and I would try it again for dinner (hopefully sitting outside). I think this place could be a real gem with a few cosmetic changes."}
{"text":"Love their Reubens!!! The jalapeño poppers are unlike any I've had. Great beer selection. 
Love the patio in the summer!
Get the cheese curds! Yum."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out this restaurant for some time. Finally had lunch there on Tuesday, July 4th. The hostess asked if we preferred \"in\" or outside on the deck. She assured us that it was pleasant with the table umbrella up, and she was so right! So out we went. Since it was Taco Tuesday there were several TexMex choices, and a special of Shrimp Tacos. I tried the Shrimp Tacos and my mate had their BBQ Pork sandwich with housemade chips. The 3 shrimp tacos came with tortilla chips and salsa. The shrimp were lightly breaded and fried, with a tiny bit of cheese and touch of pico. I've had better shrimp tacos, frankly. My mates bbq sandwich had a generous amount of meat. He thought it was a bit dry, but decent. The housemade potato chips were great. Was happy with views and the  friendly service."}
{"text":"So glad I found Waypoint! I was staying at the Country Inn & Suites next door and happened to see the restaurant while driving back to the hotel one evening. It sits on the bottom floor of an apartment complex so it's not exactly easy to see. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Metal bar stools, exposed brick, retro teardrop lights and wooden booths. It was cozy and casual. 

I started out with a Krombacher Pilsener, which was light and refreshing. There were so many options on the menu which sounded good so I recruited our waitress to help me decide, and that she did! I ordered the tilapia tacos with sweet potato fries. Our waitress ended up persuading us into trying the jalapeno poppers. Which I am so glad she did! These were different from any popper I have had, and they had just the right kick! The tliapia and aioli in the tacos was great. My only complaint is that the pineapple salsa overpowered the fish. 

Quick tip: parking is not available on the side of the building so there is a short walk. Avoid resident only spots! 

Be sure to try this place out. Great food, decent prices, and good service!"}
{"text":"Despite their misguided insistence that every wall have at least one flatscreen tv displaying some kind of sportsball, we like this place. The food and cocktails are lovely, and if you can avoid sitting in the echo chamber that is their main seating area, a pleasant dining experience can be had. I really do wish they'd make a choice--either you're a gastro-pub, or you're a sportsball bar. The twain shall never meet, in my mind. They seem to want to be both, and for us that is a barrier to being regulars.
However, every time we've had a meal here, the service has been stellar. Everyone who has waited on our table has been friendly to us and has taken great care of us. We've been here for brunch (do NOT order the yogurt and granola bowl, no matter how much you may want to. It's weird) and for dinner and lunch, and they do make sure to take the best care they can of a table.
Cocktails are well-made. The bartenders do know what they're about when they pick up a shaker. THE Manhattan is my favorite. The husband had the apricot whiskey sour, and while he enjoyed it, the stolen sips I had were especially delicious.
The food is well-prepared, and the quality has never wavered. Favorites include the deviled eggs (hold the bacon), the nachos (everything seems to be fresh. No can-openers, here) and their veggie burger--house made, bean-based, eats like a burger! These folks know how to French a fry of the shoestring variety. We're told the buffalo chicken mac 'n' cheese is quite tasty, and not too hot. Based on the yummy noises, they must make a fine meat burger as well.
Do check this place out. You won't be disappointed or hungry upon exiting."}
{"text":"First experience was great! Just finished a birthday week brunch with my family and really enjoyed the \"Pink Lemonade\" drink and \"Steak and Eggs\" meal. Our server was pleasant and really knowledgeable of the menu. Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. 
I had the tenderloin poutine, hubby had the hot Italian sandwich. Sammie was good, but the tenderloin poutine was absolutely outstanding! I would have a hard time ordering anything else, now that I've had this. But, we do want to go back, to try some of their other items. Hubby and I both agree, that they probably have an outstanding burger. Only one way to find out!
I very much like the fact that they are sourcing from local places. 
We were quite pleased with the final bill as well. Very reasonable.
Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best potatoes ever with brunch- some sort of chipotle cream sauce on double cooked potatoes. Come here and get these!"}
