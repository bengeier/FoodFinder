{"text":"My one and only place to go for fresh baked breads and natas! Place is cozy and staff are incredible."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Bought a box full of desserts, served them when we got home and guests all complained they were very stale. Tastes like they were sitting for days. Even the cream in the cannoli is hard and crusted."}
{"text":"I happened to find this little spot when I was in the area and I'm glad I did.

The ressois are delicious (chicken being my favourite). 
The cherry on my sundae was the nata. It was definitely one of the best Portuguese custard tarts I've ever had. The pastry being perfectly flaky and soft, yet crunchy and the custard was fresh and had the perfect sweetness. 

Both ladies working were very pleasant and I couldn't expect more out of the customer service. 

Overall, I had a great experience and I cannot wait to try more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this bakery/ cafe. It's tucked away in a mini community by a walk in clinic, pharmacy, and dry cleaner. It's close to a lot of residential area so it gives it a very homey vibe. 

They sell sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries. Thus are known for their Portuguese egg tarts, which is what I ended up purchasing. They did have a variety of other baked goods for sale that day too which I do have to go back for. They sell the single or half a dozen or a dozen. I did buy a dozen and enjoyed them all! 

They do serve breakfast and lunch, which I do also want to try. I noticed that they also deliver through Uber eats, which is what I'll probably do next time. They don't have a parking lot, but there is lots of street parking. I would recommend avoid school hours because it is close to a few schools and parking may be harder during pick up and drop off."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the area. Lovely cafe filled with various pastries and meal options. Staff is also one of the friendliest I've encountered. I was in need of a cake and they were very patient as I was deciding. If you ever stop by, their tarts are a must and an absolute gem. The place is nice, very cozy with a couple seats. A nice place to hangout with a friend or catch up on some work."}
{"text":"Cute bakery and cafe in Markham. They have fresh baked bread and natas. The natas are legit. We went to Portugal last year and these are the real thing!! They also serve breakfast and sandwiches which I will be sure to come back and try. The workers there are very friendly. Definitely give this local business a try."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery and cafe! The staff are amazing and take great care of their clients. The food is delicious and the treats are to die for!"}
{"text":"Another cute and quaint cafe in Greensborough! Not too busy during weekday lunch, it's a seat yourself kinda establishment with a cute deli counter. They offer an array of pastas, paninis, and baked goods. I was super pleased with my salami pesto panini which was warmed perfectly, stuffed with their fresh house made pesto and tons of salami. The BLT also was full of bacon and lettuce! Notably, they use the bread that they bake in store for the sandwiches and the freshness comes through. As for their desserts; there's a lot! Their specialty donuts are moist and have unique toppings. Having tried the tiramisu and a traditional Portugese layered cake, both were really good! Neither were too sweet and both were true to their flavours. Definitely worth checking out in the neighbourhood for a nice casual sit down cafe experience for lunch and pastries after!"}
{"text":"Dear local Markham fan,

We are delighted to try a Saturday brunch in a local baker's store.  A cute store at a corner of the townhouses set. It looked small from outside but it gives a very warm and homey impression when we walked in.  

A rainbow heart sign and free WiFi sign post right at the door. It is a LGBT and tech friendly environment in our initial observation.  

It takes a while to take order in a busy Sat breakfast hour around 10 am. Breakfast menu shows up on the ordering bench and it was a waste of time when we could have decide what to order we were lining up. There is also the menu written up on the board but it is not the same with what we were provided at the ordering bench.  Therefore, thing can be improved in term of ordering process.  

It is a local baker store, the owner named Anna and we were told that the owner and husband bake fresh goods daily from 4am.  Their signatures are fresh baked sourdough bread and Natas (tarts).    

We ordered an omelette + spinach + cheese
and buttermilk pancakes. There seems not enough communication between kitchen and the front worker.  We were told that they don't have any pancakes today after payment and awaiting.  We were fine with French toasts (that's what they were having) . The omelette is just perfectly cooked and met my cheese substitution request. Breads are absolutely great here!!!

The food presentation and plate organization both looked neat and attractive. To be very honest, their bread quality are absolutely fresh. You definitely know the freshness when you taste it. This is no regret to give in our original pancakes and tried their French toasts.  Overall, 3 scores out of 5 from my opinion. 1 score goes to service attitude, 1 score goes to food freshness, 1 score goes to store cleanliness and decor. 

Two scores are lost because of missing a complete breakfast menu and table service disorganization. We missed coffee stirring spoon, cutlery when they brought over our Americano coffees and plates. These can be improved accordingly.  Quality of the Americano coffee are average to me. I tried Americano from other similar cafe, is stronger and better in my opinion. 

Impressively, the owner chef brought the food over herself.  It was a pleasure to meet the owner who cooked our breakfast and able to see the chef in person.   

We love the decor and cleanliness inside the store. Artist paintings are exhibiting on the walls inside the store which are on sale.  We enjoyed the paintings around us during breakfast. 

We feel welcomed in this local baker and spent well to get start our days.  We look forward to experience a 5 out of 5 experience in the near future.

Kind Regards to the happy owner and cheerful staffs,

Yelper Wendy Lady :)"}
{"text":"so sweet ?nice coffe?i love the feel you can get.rest after ur hose work ...sun . nice waiter. love when i go Home i can buy a cake for my family  .make me happy .nice people. nice food .nice drink. how a  wonderful place"}
{"text":"This place is close to my home, staff are friendly, coffee is good and a nice selection of pastries!  Really a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This wonderful bakery opened up close to my house. Bonus, that I can walk there if i have a craving for something sweet. It is a fantastic cafe nestled in a large residential neighbourhood close to 2-3 elementary schools. The very first time i walked through the doors, i received a warm welcome from the owner & staff. And everything i purchased was fresh and if it was homemade, they let me know.

Some of their must try specialties that we love:

Pizzas made fresh
Homemade Rissol - huge hit in my house! Tiny croquettes filled with beef or chicken that are deep fried. Not oily at all, seasoned perfectly and i dare you to just eat 1!
Chocolate coconut cake - don't ask, just go get one, you won't be disappointed!
Homemade donuts - same as the cake - super delish! My fav is the chocolate glazed or sugared donut

Coffee/cappuccino/espresso/tea, fresh pastries, cakes, cupcakes & cookies, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, Portuguese custard tarts. They also have great pricing with their kids menu.

A nice little addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  The food is amazing.  The price is more than reasonable and they have the friendliest staff.  The baked goodies are delish but the sandwiches and pasta very good too.  The place is cozy and good for meeting up for coffee and dessert.  The Natas(custard) are now a staple for our family parties,  I always have to bring it or else I wont be welcome. Go try it out and you'll love it too."}
{"text":"Always come here when I go for a walk with my two young boys. Service is always great and we always go in for a treat for the kids and myself. Latte's taste great and pastries as well. We tried the cheese pizza today which they said they make fresh each morning and both my boys loved it. I tried a bit and it did really taste freshly made. Today the lady behind the counter went the extra mile by giving my toddler some Cars stickers and it really made his day! They are always friendly but these little things really make the place shine. Happy there's a bakery in the area that is walking distance. Also must add that all their Portuguese baked goods are delicious!"}
{"text":"Came back to have breakfast two weeks after my first visit at around 1pm. I'm a little upset that the quality is inconsistent with our previous visit. I ordered the ham and cheese croissant breakfast combo and an omelette breakfast combo (comes with salad, potatoes and coffee) again at the counter before paying and seating ourselves. The only waiter taking our order was very inexperienced and as such, not too knowledgeable on their limited menu. He ended up undercharging us and then asking if we'd take substitutions because they'd run out of croissants. Salad from the combo was crossed off their menu because they didn't have that either. 

We sat patiently but our coffees never came until we went to the counter to ask. Our meals came but there were no utensils. My \"meal\" became just a sandwich. The potatoes in my boyfriend's combo were dry and hard and half the portion compared to last week. There were probably 8 tiny pieces of potato. The omelette looked nothing like what we had the last week, but was still pretty good. While we were eating, two more waitresses showed up. I asked one if they'd forgotten the potatoes. She said she'd find out. She came back and told us we'd been undercharged but it's okay, they won't ask us for more money... Said the sandwich I'd gotten was worth more than the croissant. (On the menu, it says they are both $6.50 though). 

We're still working on our meals and another waiter comes up and asks if we're done. By this point, I'm done with more than just my food. I really wanted to like this place. It's hard to find a local neighbourhood gem but our second visit was super disappointing."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed when the previous bakery closed down.  However, when driving by a few weeks ago, we saw The Lucky 20 and made it our mission to try it.  Great decision!  We haven't had the meals yet.  We've had the strawberry cheesecake, carrot cake (my son's favourite), the natas (good grief goodness!), giant cookies and rissois (addictive).  The nata's go FAST!  If you want those, you need to get there early as that seems to be the hot product.

Most recently, we took some rissois and natas when visiting friends and they loved them!  Those kids went to town on the rissois.  The mama really enjoyed the natas.

The customer service has always been beyond reproach.

Please support this small local business.  We need a place like this in our neighbourhood.  I can see us spending a lot of time there in the summer especially.

I'm reserving 1 star until I try the meals but I haven't seen any reason why I won't bump them up."}
{"text":"We had the grilled chicken panini and the grilled pork sandwich.
I love how they are made with fresh bread they bake in house.
We also had the potato bacon soup, it was made in house but a bit bland.
The best was the portugese tarts. Must try those when you come here."}
{"text":"Happened to discover this place while driving down BurOak and it was very different to what we were expecting!  A lovely little café with a large variety of dessert and Portuguese tarts.  The custard tarts are SO good and the coffee was really good.

Very friendly staff!  They serve breakfast as well as a variety of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Delicious find!  Love the decor.  Seating though not abundant are roomy and cosy feel.  Store owners are lovely and explains the pastries if you are not sure what is what.

Will definitely go back to try their breakfast and lunch menu"}
{"text":"So happy that a bakery has reopened here. We have tried the Natas and they are hands down the best I have ever had. They are always fresh. Crispy shell and a nice smooth filling. We recently discovered the Rosca de coco ( may have spelled that wrong).  It's a large danish type ring with custard filling and toasted coconut topping. This is amazing! We have to come back for breakfast one morning. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I walked into this spacious cafe after seeing some pictures on instagram. I was surprised at how much space they had inside to sit. 

I was greeted by a friendly woman when I walked in. She mentioned a few of the things that they sell and let me browse the displays. I would have taken some pictures but I had sadly forgotten my phone. 

I am addicted to custard. I would have it all day everyday if possible. I was ready to buy a bunch of their Portuguese custard tarts which I had been seeing a lot of on instagram. Unfortunately, that is when I found out that they don't take credit. I was utterly disappointed at that moment (hence 4 stars and not 5). I decided on one at the time since I somehow had cash on me (I NEVER have cash on me and don't use debit for safety). Thankfully I had the cash, but I probably still would have returned one day, with cash. Unfortunately because of this, I could not try any other foods. 

I tried the custard tart and I was immediately in heaven. It was perfectly flakey and gooey and creamy and just. Plain. DELICIOUS . 

I think I've found my new go-to treat that is so much better than a cupcake and so fulfilling. Thank goodness that they make pills for the lactose-intolerant like me, or I would not have survived if I couldn't eat this tart. 

I highly recommend coming here (with cash) and try these tarts. If you like custard or creamy desserts then you will love this tart. I can't believe I've written such a long review about a tart but it's THAT good! I will be back, but not as often as I'd like. I would really like it if they took credit and maybe have a minimum spend if that's what is stopping them. I would buy a dozen every time. Yum."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery shop nestled in amongst suburbia. Odd to get to as it's a one way half moon street, but you can park along it. Great place to go if you live in area or pick up, but way hidden to main traffic. There's a park and benches in middle of half moon drive. 

Clean and pretty cafe, 4-6 tables, good choices of sandwiches to desserts. What sets them apart here is their Natas(Portuguese tarts) are really Really good! It's like a heavier version of creme brûlée set in a flaky pastry shell, flamed on top but no sugar crust. Had ordered 12 but then wanted more but they had sold out right after that, they had pre orders of 40 and 100 in that same day.
The owner was nice enough to explain they are quick to make but needs over an hour to cool down, otherwise it's hot molten lava and they will not let you leave the store with that dangerous goodness sloshing around. So be warned if you need these one day- PREORDER! 
Would check back again for more sweet soon."}
{"text":"Lucky 20 is located in the Greensborough community of Markham. It used to be Caldense Bakery and they some of the same foods & Portuguese products, but when i asked i didn't get a clear answer as to if they were the same owners or not - oh well no biggie!

I've tried their baked goods, rissoles and food they prepare. I was REALLY disappointed when i found that almost all of their baked goods are not even made in house and come from various suppliers. Weekends there is not much selection and cakes with phyllo or cream visibly don't look fresh. When i inquired i was told that deliveries are made Tuesday's or Wednesday's. Not a reliable place to stop into if you're looking for weekend dessert for guests or parties. Maybe just close on the weekends?

A few items we've bought have been a bit on the dry/stale side. I gave them 3 stars for their fresh baked bread & natas. Otherwise they would've received 1 star less. I feel as though the bakery was run better when the owner was always behind the counter. She was great with customers and would check in the back if they were ever out of something. Which almost never happens now.

Staff for the most part is friendly. Except for 1-2 that are only overly friendly with regulars but not the general public. Any way, i've tried them out a few times now, but doubt i will be back."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

The Lucky 20 is a nice neighbourhood cafe. Great as a meetup place for friends or just to chill over a cup of coffee.

The staff here is super friendly and nice. 

Pastéis de Nata ($1.55) and Americano ($2.00) 

Portugal Egg Custard Tart is fresh and with a nice flaky shell. The custard can be a little smoother but still pretty good. Americano was so so...

Worth checking out if you live in the hood and support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Cakes are delicious and their price is good too. Should drop by some time during the day to enjoy their brewed coffee and a piece of cake."}
{"text":"Great Pasteis de Nata!!! Some of the best I have ever had. I also got shrimp rissios which was also very good. The manager was very pleasant and even gave me an extra rissios because they were a little smaller than normal. 

I will definitely return! Portuguese is hard to find in Markham."}
