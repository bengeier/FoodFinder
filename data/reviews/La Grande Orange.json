{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place...food is fabulous, staff is fabulous! I can't get enough of their peanut butter cookies and Thai chicken salad...yum!!!"}
{"text":"I would agree that the food and pastries here are above average, but when I walk into a small, crowded, noisy place and don't know where to go for a simple beverage and no employee seems to notice my perplexity or to care, I come away feeling the place is pretentious, snobby, confusing and out of my league. Which is too bad, because it's right in my neighborhood. I sense that if you're a regular here, then probably you feel welcome and the employees chat you up all time. But not all of us can afford to be regulars here. This is at least the third time that La Grande Orange's uppity ambience has annoyed me, so I don't feel guilty about the poor review."}
{"text":"Been here many times for breakfast, the place is a zoo, but it is sort of a controlled chaos, but tonight it was just a write off. I don't know if they were short staffed, but a quick coffee, turned into 20 minutes, then we were told to go stand in line again (10 deep) at 7pm?!?  Extremely slow service, so if you want a quick coffee in the evening go somewhere else, but they seem to have morning coffee figured out!  Of course the parking is the usual :("}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade. My favorite neighborhood spot! My faves are the hot pressed tuna sandwich, the commuter, and the spicy tuna sushi. Never been disappointed on a visit. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Excited to have this local gem in the airport. No secret it has some ah-mazing food/beverages. Only issue is it's not so easy to see where the line forms to order and it bottle necks and results in several \"are you next\" questions to be asked to all the other patrons standing around you. Hope they can work on signage to streamline the issue. Glad to see LGO in the airport where it will gain stong visibility."}
{"text":"The parking sucks, its kind of pricey, and there is generally a long line....  but it is ALL worth it and I still give it five stars.  I never come to Phoenix without visiting La Grande Orange. Amazing food and ambiance, amazing pastries and so much fun stuff to buy!"}
{"text":"I agree with the poster who says it has gone down hill in the last year. We used to go every Saturday for a muffin and coffee. Currently I will not even eat a muffin there because they keep them out on the counter, uncovered, right by the cash registers for anyone to touch, sneeze on, drop money on, etc. Maybe I'm a little obsessive,  but I have to imagine there are other OCDs that feel the same. Last weekend we were there and people paying for their meals hover directly over the muffins and croissants, talking over them and brushing up against them. I wonder how much spit spray ends up on those by the end of the day? I asked if they had any muffins on trays in the back, but they were all up front. Gross! Plus the muffins are much smaller than they used to be."}
{"text":"Well I just keep loving LGO! I blame the baked goods that always seem to entice me when I go. Just when I think I'm done placing an order, I look over in the display at the pastries that seem to call out to me and say \"Dani, look at me! Eat me! I'm yummy!\" I'm making my way through their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Well I'm not counting the time where I found that they stopped serving chilaquiles, I'm meaning taste wise."}
{"text":"Gave LGO another shot and they have forever won back our business. Our servers name was Lindsey and she made our night a perfect experience. Thank you LGO for making it right!"}
{"text":"So far, I've only had their salads, sushi and of course, pizza and I really adore this place!  When I feel like pizza, this is the place to go to. Make sure to stop by the Grateful Spoon next door for a yummy gelato!  The fact that this place is dog friendly makes it an extra bonus!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that give Phoenix more of an artsy, independent feel and less of a city of Super-Walmart-Target-Sam's-Club strip mall attractions. The food is homemade and fresh and the ambience is fun."}
{"text":"Their OJ is to white Bronco run for. (Reference too old?)  LGO had a great atmosphere. Very European. I was seated outside and it was, for lack of a better word, pleasant. Very relaxing. Everybody seemed to be really happy there- except the people who weren't sitting. There just isn't enough outdoor seating so people would be floating around like hawks. Learn to ignore them and all will be well.   I had their French 'Pancakes' which honestly is American for crepes. Seeing it written this way on the menu reminded me Ricky Bobby: Talledega Nights. \"Those thin pancakes? I LOVE THOSE!\"   They're not too sweet so if you're expecting IHOP-like sweetness you'll be very disappointed. Everything here, I believe, is fresh including the fruit; it means that it's not always going to be super sweet.   \"The Big Orange\" is also a grocery store and from what I could gather, you had to bring your own bags. Remember, if the groceries don't fit acquit!  Someone needs to shoot me. With a review this bad I'm getting away with murder :)"}
{"text":"In a sea of restaurant possibilities, La Grande Orange stands out. When I think of the ONE THING I want to eat after breaking a diet, running a half marathon or just sitting on my computer all day, it has to be the Commuter Sandwich with Smoked Salmon paired with an LGO Arnold Palmer. The Commuter is so simple but perfectly executed with their amazing ingredients.   If I'm feeling really saucy, I'll add their Green Chile Mac n' Cheese. It is the creamiest Mac n' Cheese I've ever eaten and has a subtle kick from the chilies.   Besides the food, I love checking out their collection of nick-nacks and the old school candy collection. It's also a great place to bring my dogs and sit in their shady garden area.   LGO Grocery is just a fun, laid back place to get some great food."}
{"text":"I have yet to hit up this place for lunch, but it's already a favorite because their desserts are out of this world. Their sea salt chocolate chip cookie changed my world. Seriously."}
{"text":"I love LGO! It is such a great place to hang out on a Saturday or Sunday and get breakfast, brunch or lunch. There is a great atmosphere and lots of delicious food. The salted chocolate chip cookies are to die for. Love the croque madame too. YUM!"}
{"text":"Best Reuben Sandwich I have ever had. It is a bit pricey but tasted great."}
{"text":"Commuter sandwich on homemade English muffin? Check. The best bran muffin EVER? Check. Tammie Coe coconut cupcake? Check. Fresh carrot/apple juice? Check.   Been making the trek over here ever since it opened and have never been disappointed. And every guest we've brought has always asked us to bring them again the next time they're in town. Note: My single friends swear LGO has some of the best eye candy around. I'll have to take their word for it; I haven't noticed. ;-)  The valet option has pretty much resolved the parking crisis and there are always new goodies to bring home. Just received an LGO hat as a gift -- even THAT is perfect. I heart LGO.  Next time I swear I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"Had the open faced breakfast sandwich with ham, Gruyere cheese, egg, tomato and I think avocado. On grilled bread. Wow! Was unexpectedly delicious! Probably way too many calories and fat grams and a tad bit greasy but it was worth it! Highly recommend this place for breakfast. Coffee was so-so."}
{"text":"Love the salads! Just wish they could make them fresh so I don't have to eat them out of a plastic box!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for years, and finally being able to get a parking spot close by, I decided to try it. But low and behold the pizzeria was full so I was directed to a very cluttered and crowded market with the same menu. Besides the uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere, it was frustrating finding a spot to wait for my food without being pushed in a corner or up against a display. And sorry, the food was good but those had to be magic avocados for the price I paid for that personal pizza."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I drive across town to come here on Sundays, we love it! Super fresh ingredients, great vibe....just a little crowded though. Working your way through the crowds are worth every last morsel!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in PHX. Its that good. Also, to whoever your buyer is that makes the call on the products you sell in the grocer--props to them. Love everything."}
{"text":"One of the best places in PHX. Its that good. Also, to whoever your buyer is that makes the call on the products you sell in the grocer--props to them. Love everything."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Try the commuter sandwich, or the gourmet giant cookies.  Fast service for such quality food."}
{"text":"This place has it going on.  A little pricey for a small portion.  But oh what a portion it is.   I have never been here when its not packed to the brim.   A little yuppy for my taste, but I like the same foods yuppies eat, so I have no choice."}
{"text":"Great grocer and lunch spot. The only drawback is parking. If you can beat the noon hour parking is not bad. There is a lot on the north side of Campbell that usually has spots.   On to the food. If the summer rolls are in the cold case, then they are a must.  The veggie burger is very good - a little mushy, but great flavor and a killer bun. If you are splurging, add on fries.  The Tammie Coe sweets are always sure to satisfy. My personal favorite is the red velvet cake and my wife loves the brownie fingers. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with anything with their signature English muffins and they have great coffee.   Pizzas are a must, but I've reviewed under the LGO Pizzeria page.   The grocery store itself has neat gifts and gadgets for the kitchen and sometimes the office. Stroll around while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually go to LGO at about 4:00PM on weekdays, when most of the ridiculous \"see and be seen\" crowd is gone.  The Commuter Sandwich is good, as is the Cubano.  Luckily, we live close enough to walk...Parking here is tough, I would imagine.  Although it is called a \"Grocery\", I think \"gift shop\" would be more appropriate.  They do have a decent cheese display, although overpriced.  Just don't arrive here thinking that you'll be able to buy actual ingredients for everyday cooking.  If you can walk here, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Yep, I heart LGO too. I have been know to drive from Tempe to satisfy my ceasar salad craving. Theirs really is the best I've had. Also, the tasty morsels they have in the front glass case are a huge hit wherever I bring them. The cupcakes from Tammie Coe (best birthday cakes .......also does wedding cakes etc and can make them look like your favorite Chanel bag or Jimmy Choos ...(WHO CAN DO IT? Tammie CAN!!) My boyfriend said that Tammie Coe is the only woman he'd leave me for.....not Jessica Alba or Gisele. (Maybe I should write a separate review of Tammie Coe Cakes) Anyway, LGO staffers, always efficient, friendly and willing to make your day!"}
{"text":"I love the food and coffee here (although I would double dog dare anyone to actually commute anywhere while trying to eat the commuter breakfast sandwich). Long lines? I can deal with those. But for food/coffee this expensive why... WHY are there tip jars out? Please explain to me why I need to tip... for someone to call out my name? Really? Are you not paying your employees enough? It's ridiculous. I hate tip jars. But the service is always good so I feel like a jerk for not tipping, which results in fewer visits here. Seriously, your price+tip=way too much for what you get.  Also, what's up with the disappearance of the small yogurt granola? It's not on the menu and missing from the refrigerated case the last couple of times I've been in there. Boo."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up some dessert and was helped by a cute redhead who answered all my questions and was quick & efficient. Good job. Even though the place was busy and crowded, I got great service and great pastries. Thanks for the suggestions."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Always a great vibe. Food is always the same, yet predictably great. I highly suggest it.. Just remember there is typically a line at lunch so get there early"}
{"text":"Home of my favorite salad ever:  Kale and Quinoa with shredded chicken, grapes, red bell pepper and Champagne vinaigrette.  All fresh and wonderful ingredients, but the one that puts it overt the top is the addition of preserved Meyer lemon.  When I fly west, I choose Phoenix as the layover so that I can get his salad.  That is how good it is.  Just the right mix of fresh, high quality ingredients plus the wonderful preserved Meyer lemon. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"I had an hour before my flight and needed something to eat. This place looked quick. They have an extensive menu so there will hopefully be something you'll like. I got the guacamole BLT. What a perfect combination of flavors and textures;  e.g. -the crispiness of the bacon and the toasted bread -the freshness of the lettuce and tomatoes -and dat powerful punch from the holy guacamole  Not a bad choice for eating at the airport."}
{"text":"Lots of character. Great buzz and atmosphere.  Go here at least once per week. Need better coffee though."}
{"text":"Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I have dined here a couple times.. I first took my wife there in late November for a birthday lunch after a trip the Phx Art Museum. I had stopped by there previously to pick-up some of the coconut cupcakes made by Tammy Coe also located in the same center.. Anyways, I tried the BLT with avocado and some fresh fruit. Very good, bacon is crispy and the sourdough is great..   If your looking for a good small wine selection, check it out. I like they have some hard to find Shiraz which normally retail for $20-$30 bux elsewhere!  The cupcakes are all very good.. I like the red velvet and the coconut.."}
{"text":"A great place with impossible parking.  Just  a minor hurdle on my way to a cute neighborhood hang out place in a neighborhood that I don't live in.    Good sandwich, better pizzas and best vibe for a little cafe-like place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been to LGO twice now, and neither time been overly impressed, but please know I want to like it. The layout of the store is great, the food items all sounds amazing, and I like the valet parking. Unfortunately, everything I have ordered (the pizza salad and a tuna sandwich) have sounded better than they actually tasted, the service is also really slow even in the middle of the day and both times they have been out of my first selection. I will give it another shot and certainly hope it improves..."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange---La Confusing. When I walked in I felt totally disoriented trying to figure out where I was supposed to go. It was nice I met someone here who had been before. He showed me the ropes.   Ordered the San Danielle Sandwich - simple grilled type of sandwich. Nothing spectacular, but was satisfying for the most part. The outside, which was most likely sprayed with the butter crap was way toooooo salty for my tastes.  The people were pretty nice, a nice play to sit and have a conversation.  I guess that's all I have to say about it. Wish I had more passion for the place...."}
{"text":"Parker was the most amazing server I have had if not ever, at least the best in a very long time. He made great suggestions from food to drink and I am not always impressed when servers make suggestions. Parker was attentive but not needy. The other staff members well very delightful, kind and willing to help. The little shop was awesome, great for gifts, not cheap quick fixes but very thoughtful and cute. Sonoma salad was grand, especially for a salad. I will be back and its worth the drive for me. I also had rhe wings but I dont care for spice that much, I wasnt ready for the kick. Could have been a bit more tender."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on how I feel about LGO now.   I had been going to LGO for over 3 years. We used to go there pretty much every weekend. The daygrinder, french crepes, commuter, yogurt parfait, vegatable sandwich were all favorites.   For some reason now, the portions are smaller and not as good. It's not just one time, but the past three times I have gone, I have been mildly disappointed with the quality of the food. For example, the yogurt parfait used to have loads of strawberries and fruit. Now, they hardly provide much fruit The daygrinder is almost 3/4 the size they used to make it. The vegetable sandwish was filled with vegetables; now, it's a disappointment.   I'm glad I went to this place when there was no line and the food was good. Now the lines are long and the quality has, unfortunately, fell by the wayside. It's a shame. I'll still hold out hope that they turn back to the LGO I enjoyed going to a couple years ago.   For now, I saw au revoir LGO."}
{"text":"This place has more hype than actual delivery! Frankly I didn't like their turkey snadwich at all. I was mediocre at best! Their store sells some pretty cool stuff, but what's the point if the food ain't good. I know many other smaller, cheaper places that make a better sandwich."}
{"text":"It is the coolest neighborhood joint I have ever been in!  I stop by nearly daily bc the atmosphere is cool and laid back, and the food is yummy!  I never go wrong with take out salads, a quick breakfast granola parfait, or spending the evening socializing with some friends over a one-of-a-kind, sourdough pizza!   The noise can be loud but its part of the fun!  Parking can also be challenging so I recommend biking or walking, if local.  If not, its well worth the headache of finding parking to enjoy the LGO experience.   Don't forget my favorite dessert --the salted chocolate chip cookie!  You won't find it anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I needed Gluten Free for an allergy, the make a five star Gluten Free pizza and the staff is kind. Allow 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I love LGO and Ingo's! One of my favorite places to go and has everything I would ever want: pizza, burgers, salad, sushi, baked goods, sandwiches, breakfast, smoothies, gelato, etc. YUM.  Now I am going to have to make a pit stop in their handy To Go parking spots because I just thought of all their delicious food."}
{"text":"Favorite. I've been a customer for years. A review is long overdue.   Best parts: The pizzeria makes great pizza. I like LGO pizza, The Parlor, and Pizzeria Bianco and I feel like they're all in the same neighborhood of enjoyment for me. LGO pizza is less expensive than other options that I like less.   The gelato is some of the best in town, creamy and delicious.   The breakfast items are a good value - the roasted potato yanks are routinely crispy, cooked to perfection, and expertly seasoned with paprika. The commuter breakfast - an Lgo English muffin with egg (and additional salmon, for me) is a classic.   Parts I don't like as much: Sometimes the music is too loud and when they're playing something I don't like at high volume, that gets in the way of my enjoyment. It happens infrequently.   Also, lately the french fries have been soggy. And the employees know it and have warned me away from them.  Chef - please note - no one likes soggy fries."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything that has not already been said. This place is fun, funky, and delicious. My go to sandwich is the Croque Madame. The egg on top is always cooked perfectly and its a big sandwich for your $$ ! I have yet to order here and NOT get a desert ( I can't help myself!!).... you really can't go wrong. I love all the cookies but the last few times I have been sucked in by the cupcakes..... banana bread cupcake with toasted coconut frosting... DONE! So moist and the frosting was killer ( but there is a lot of it)  I love all the quirky gifts you can buy in here, and a lot of it is by local artists! I always get all my stocking stuffers here! My most recent purchase was a LGO hot/cold cup .... so much cooler than the Starbucks ones :)   Love everything about this place! I really do... its my favorite place to stop after a hike up Camelback! ... really its just my favorite place to stop period. :)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait in line, store has tons of things to buy after eating.  Had hash that was added to menu and was great taste and perfect amount."}
{"text":"The Commuter Sandwich with turkey was amazing. The turkey was so fresh and flavorful, juicy and splendid. On top of that the Bear Claw pastry looking thing was crispy, sweet and delightful!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the gladiator pizza.  Not a big fan of the salted chocolate chip cookie--maybe an acquired taste.  Would go back for other desserts."}
{"text":"This restraunt only gets 4 stars because it is so ridiculously busy(and apparently so all the time). However...people this place is AMAZING! I had the Avacado pizza and would have eaten the entire thing myself, had I not had a little self control. The ice tea here is also really good. Definitely check it out if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I love the tammie Coe cupcakes and their bakery but the espresso drinks are horrible! I have only been there in the evening so maybe it's just the people that work nights but I don't even get one anymore because it is so gross. I love the brand of espresso they use so not sure what the problem is. Otherwise it's great there. Love the store."}
{"text":"the best wings in town...baked not deep fried...pizza is good...sandwich with chiebatta bread with smoked salmon, delicious...recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Lively, a bit different, diverse menu.  Commuter sandwich has to be my fav."}
{"text":"Hi, may I have the Cuban please? Very rudely, \"Uhhh, you mean The Cubano?\"  Oh, not a good way to start our little transaction here.  Well let me tell you that your little Cubano is horrible. I'm pretty sure if I owned a George Foreman Grill, had some miracle whip (CUBANS DON'T HAVE MAYO!!), Oscar Meyer ham, Vlasic pickles, and week old stale bread, I could still whip up a better sandwich than you served me. And probably quicker than in the 10 minutes it took you to make it.  I definitely won't be returning here.  Rude service, terrible sandwich, and too long of a wait, especially in an airport location."}
{"text":"Usually I go to the Pasadena, California, restaurant, but since I was in the Phoenix area, I wanted to pick up their English Muffins to have with breakfast.  Our group of guys were staying the weekend in Phoenix, and everybody thought the muffins were great.  So when in town, have LGO mufins to go.  The bakery at the store looked really good."}
{"text":"NOT FRENCH IN ANY WAY! Why in that category? The sandwiches were mediocre (yellow mustard, grocery store bread?). Atmosphere was chaotic. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Crowd and wait can be tough at dinner.  Lunch is usually quick, especially if you order at the counter.  Parking can be awful.  You will enjoy this place so much more on \"off hours\".    Pizzas:  the way to go, for sure."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait for food, this is definitely the best place to eat for gates C and D!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the waiting. Takes 15-20 minutes for a pizza and about 10 minutes for a sandwich but other than that it is great!  Very good food for an airport and even on its own!!"}
{"text":"This place is so busy - it is most definitely not a hidden gem, although it sits back in the neighborhood.  The food and coffee are good - but most of all, I like that I can walk my dog here to get coffee and the newspaper on the weekend.  I wish that there were more places that allowed pets outside.   The parking can be a pain and the ordering and picking up of food can be chaotic.  But, once you get settled - this is a good place to visit."}
{"text":"Impossible to park. (Small lot and a helluva walk from non-permit streets. No meters: it's Phoenix.)  Decent food and drinks.  Service can be OK...or towards the rude/don't care side. Depends on who is serving. A very young staff will often yield this result.  Too many employees behind the main counter not doing anything. Not a manager-heavy environment.  ONE employee at the coffee bar making espresso-based drinks; a counter which is usually backlogged.  Too much crap/displays littering the register/order area. Confusing layout, no signage and no line ropes to help form orderly queues.  Seating area tables and chairs (in the big room with the grills) often not properly wiped down; crumby.  An expensive-ish modern American/gastro-pizza pub-ish menu.  Dessert case = a step above Fry's/store-bought.  Mostly a scene. Not about a quality dining experience.  People go here mainly to say \"Let's go to LGO!\" I'm convinced if it wasn't for the snappy acronym, business would drop 39%.  Super-fancy building exterior and interior decorating though!  No thanks."}
{"text":"Would be a 4-star in normal circumstances, but compared to most fast airport fare, this is a 5-star.  I have eaten meals here twice and stopped here several times for coffee and a treat.  Each time has been quite good.  For food, I've tried a burger and also a hot sandwich, and each were good.    I enjoy the cold-brewed iced coffee very much, so that's my recommendation if you're not traveling at mealtime.  Get yourself an iced coffee with two $.75 mini-cookies, pour in some half-and-half and you have an excellent snack before hopping on your plane.    If you arrive in terminal D, grab an iced coffee to go and drag it out of the terminal on to your rental car bus.  It is a great pick-me-up to nurse for the whole day."}
{"text":"I love the pastries - The pasty chef is amazing! I love that he stays true to his craft and makes items that look and taste homemade. They are not overdone or over decorated. Real food done real well!  I love the atmosphere! Tons of energy - The gift buyer has impeccable taste! They hire the best in their respected fields."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to love...  It's rare to find a place that's so unusual in the middle of Phoenix.   Everything is good and they have these french pancakes that I can't resist getting each time I go. That's a problem because their pizza is so good... So now I figure I'll still get the french pancakes and take a pizza home for dinner.  I just like the whole atmosphere. Very city like with tight cramped rows of grocery items and gifts along with tables scattered about to sit and enjoy the weather.   Sandwiches, Breakfast, Pizza and don't forget the most beautiful decorated cakes I've ever seen. I have yet to try them because they appear dangerous to my thighs."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian sandwich!  Staff was courteous, timely, and the food was reasonably priced.  For a quick bite between flights, this restaurant was quite good."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite at LGO, especially very early when there is still seating and parking. This morning reading my paper over poached eggs, I realized the crowd is starting to wear on me - some guy at the next table was loudly pontificating about \" and then Senator So-And-So told me...\", while the hard body bikers glided past, and a couple of Angelina Jolie clones with tousled just-out-of-bed hair, pucci-style (or real?) sundresses slinked in...if you look like like me in the morning (a poor schlump lucky to get her shirt on right side out - maybe), definitely gird your self-esteem before braving the LGO morning crowd.  Ok, I still love the food, the outdoor seating, and the cool knickknacks; so being rather thick skinned about my schlumpiness, I continue to go. But jeez I'm gonna puke if I hear any more Senator So-and-So conversations."}
{"text":"cool place, great vibe, yummy cubano sandwich."}
{"text":"Clean is at the top of my list and this passes on that first point.  First timers be prepared to ask about the ordering process.  They don't make it clear and have so many regulars. As you are feeling relief from having just scored a parking spot, you walk in not quite prepared for the process of ordering. I told the cashier I was new to their restaurant and asked several questions the first two times: Where do I pick up my order? What cold teas do you offer? May I sit anywhere? How do I access the wi-fi? May I park across the street? Where can I get a re-fill? First cashier was a bit annoyed, but second was very helpful.   I have regularly returned for the consistent good food since moving to the Biltmore area. My husband has commented on the portion size, but he likes his breakfasts hearty.  LGO has certainly carved out a niche with the locals and I will continue to enjoy it for what it is - a neighborhood gathering spot that serves a consistent menu of quality choices."}
{"text":"I go to LGO any chance I get for breakfast. I love love it!! The coffee, lemonade and the french pancakes (well any of their pancakes) are soooo good.  Besides, you can browse the shop for unique gifts.  I only bought a plant once. But, they have neat things if you ever need it..."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is one of those fantastically energetic smallish neighbor markets that offers an ever shifting and marvelous menagerie of breakfast, take home, and baked items. For years it has successfully maintained a well deserved reputation as a local favorite for numerous meals, the only downside to this quirky Phoenix favorite is that it can become absolutely overrun during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast is my personal favorite meal at LGO but don't leave without a salted chocolate chip cookie, I'm absolutely sure that patrons could easily come to blows over ridiculously large sweet and salty treats."}
{"text":"I loooove LGO grocery, and I go there every single time I visit Phoenix. However, the food at this airport LGO just doesn't taste the same. The english muffin for the Commuter Sandwich was stale, and the mayo in it was different. Normally, the mayo sauce is very tasty and is dripping when you eat the sandwich. The Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie was definitely not fresh because it was dry and crumbly.    I definitely support LGO, but if you had a choice, go to the real LGO grocery and not the airport one."}
{"text":"Avocado pizza??? are you high? guess not, it was fantastic.  strongly recommend this place.    [this was meant for the pizzeria not grocery]"}
{"text":"went for the giant salted chocolate chip cookie, An it is the best cookie you'll have, big chunks of chocolate chips, Parking is No bueno and the place was Packed! need to try the food next time...."}
{"text":"11 bucks for a cheeseburger would almost be acceptable if the cheeseburger were exceptional. The burgers served here are not. It's an airport with few options for food so I suppose they are taking advantage of a captive audience. On the plus side, the service is good and it looked like the folks who ordered the pizza were happy. Next time I'll try that instead."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for an airport. After a week of traveling, I was ready for a light fare, and the Shangri-La vegetarian burger fit the bill. The great part was that it was fresh made, not just a frozen veggie pattie warmed up."}
{"text":"My flight got delayed so I decided to stop here and grab something to eat. I ended up getting a turkey sandwich and cheese pizza. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Biltmore/Arcadia area. This place is hippie and full of energy. The food served here is very fresh. The staff always happy and ready to help.   I had ordered things from the menu and they were all very tasty....Don't forget to try their fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"I heart La Grande Orange Grocery.  I think we ended up here or at one of the LGO Hospitality restaurants everyday of our trip.  I had the pastrami and potato omelette for breakfast twice.  The black-bottom cupcake is incredible - one of the best that I've ever had.  It's a trio of french chocolates, baked into the center.  There is a a teeny bit of super rich chocolate frosting on the top.  They have salads-to-go and sushi-to-go.  It's always busy and hectic but I love the environment.  The grocery store part of it sells wine, fresh-baked breads, artisan meats and cheeses and assorted gourmet food items.  They also stock gifts and stationery - lots of French Bull items.  I wish we had something like LGO on the east coast."}
{"text":"I love love love the Havana latte...I live in Colorado and every time I visit Phoenix this is a must stop for me...why oh why won't they come to Colorado =( sigh"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in the English muffins now. They used to be hand made so delicious. Now they taste awful. So bummed!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times since I moved into the area. Each time the staff seemed to have an attititude. It's as if they were looking down on me. The food and the tea were good, but not good enough for me to return. I will spend my cash at places with more personable staff members."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and frequent this place. The food is always good.  I recommend the Thai chicken salad, the pizzeria chopped salad, and the avocado pizza. They also sometimes have special salads in the case, like cucumber and wild rice. Those are usually pretty good too.  They also have an impressive dessert case. I've tried a lot of the these treats and I have no complaints. The old time cupcakes are good and I was surprised how much I liked the butterscotch oatmeal cookie.  The only bad thing about this place is the parking. Its truly a nightmare. I usually just ride my bike to avoid it. Seriously, I have no interest in valeting my car to go in and get something to go. They do have curbside to go and that works well if you call in an order, but sometimes I just want to stop in and the lack of parking makes this quite difficult."}
{"text":"This is a good place if you like loud music (so loud that the cashier can't hear you and you can't hear them!) and a store that is PACKED so that one person can get around the store at a time.  They sell lots of little items and it appears more like a tourist trap than a grocery store.  I wasn't thrilled with the store at all, small parking, small inside and packed with stuff!  However, we did leave with a few English muffins (which are huge!) - they are really really good, I would stop by and get them again.  Also had an old fashioned cake, like a hostess chocolate cake, which was also really good - but they didn't make it.    Great place to take friends for a once experience, not great for eating there often or for large groups."}
{"text":"Love love love you, LGO.  Your tasty pies, your 4 cent sangria, your celery plate for the little one.  Your cheese plate, your super funky super hip soundtrack.  Your super cool grocery with books and mugs and coffee.  Oh that you were near me, I would patronize you 3x per week - but alas, at 400 miles from home, ours will always be a long distance relationship."}
{"text":"I've always have gone to LGO after Postino and to get a dessert. I finally can now say I've had food that wasn't sweet.  The commuter sandwich was great. The muffin is awesome and the meet, egg and avocado really makes this a great sandwich for breakfast or brunch.  The one down side is the parking and trying to secure a table because of the popularity and good food being served here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, a huge variety of food/drinks and trinkets in addition to awesome food. The service was great, with a greeter at the door directing us where the ordering window was, and our food came out very fast. Defiantly a new favorite."}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered 3 dishes - all great. Blueberry muffins and the press tuna sandwich is to die for. I'm digging this place - perhaps my top 3 breakfast joint worldwide."}
{"text":"Walk here if you can. Ha! Phoenix is a totally car-oriented town. So La Grande Orange Grocery sort of shoots itself in the foot by having minimal parking. Minimal in relation to the grocery/deli/pizzeria capacity.   Be that as it may, I love the food at the deli here. Sandwiches are very delicious, well crafted and have great ingredients. Breakfast things served until 4 pm. Then the Pizzeria opens, and you have to order from the tables. The grocery side has all kinds of kitchen gadgets that the wanna be Julia Child or Emeril LaGasse just has to have. They also have interesting spices and teas for sale. Plenty of stuff to help separate you from your money and make you feel great at the same time."}
{"text":"Went for brunch/lunch on a Sunday - wow, it was packed and with good reason!  The store and food was fabulous!  I had the Jersey Girl Omelette along with the green tea - pastrami, potatoes, fruit, toast...done to perfection and very tasty.  We even found a seat - next to impossible there.  I will definitely be back to try their pizza and other dishes that they had available.  4 stars as opposed to 5 because of the parking and long lines - but it was definitely worth it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I completely love the atmosphere here! It has a quaint vibe and manages to have a homemade feel even if it isn't. The desserts are amazing. I cannot get enough of the lemon bars. They have a really good selection of fresh food too. I haven't tried the pizza yet but based on the food I have tried, I'm sure I would like it. I actually really enjoy the fact that it has small gifts throughout the store. I enjoy looking at the selection while I wait on food or decide what to eat. And although the food is moderately priced, the souvenirs, books, candles, etc. are really pricey. In fact I have yet to buy any of the shop items despite my multiple visits/temptations. I think the place should price their items so that it is more on the level of their food pricing. At least they would sell more items that way. I feel like the prices are what you would find at a high end boutique, which doesn't really make sense in such a laid back, easy going atmosphere. But at least the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Better start with a disclaimer: LGO is my absolute FAVORITE spot in the Phoenix area. Next, the caveat: I LOVE it in the mornings, and as it gets more crowded into later AM I move toward liking it less, to the point where, depending on season, I truly dislike it when it is overrun with tourists and other mouth breathers.  When it is at it's best (early morning to mid-morning weekdays, and early mornings weekends), it's got a great, urbane energy, is filled with attractive, interesting people, the food comes out fairly quickly, and it is the ONLY slice of NorCal energy I have found in the metro Phoenix area.  My faves include the double cappuccino (BEST in town!), french pancakes (with everything!), Croque Madame (GOTTA do the ham), the scones (very unusual variety), the Daybreaker (if I'm feeling like being healthy), any and all chased with a bottle of San Pellegrino water from the cold case. The fresh squeezed OJ is good but VERY pulpy. OH - and the new 'side', mac 'n cheese (w/jalepeno), is AMAZING. OMG SO creamy and delicious. If you have only ONE thing, seriously, this has to be it!  A warning......when they are not over busy the place is awesome, and you don't have to hover by the counter waiting for your cap or food to come out, and it's good, and hot. However, when the place is swarming, idiotic people who don't check the ticket for their name (food comes out and your name is called, but then it sits waiting), will walk off with your stuff, and/or the quality is just not as good at the these super-busy times, so I would encourage you to come when it's not slammed, or go elsewhere if it is."}
{"text":"While I have been a fan for LGO for years now, Cole and his pastry team have made me a true LGO fan for life. I first met Cole when working with him to create 2 custom cakes for my wedding last year, which turned out so great, and still edible and tasty after freezing a slice for a year. Then we found out that we were expecting a little one and who else could we turn to, to make us a gender reveal cake, but Cole again! We gave him free reign for flavor, d√©cor, etc. and I have to say that his vanilla bean coconut cream cheese toasted pecan cake was one of the best cakes I have ever tasted, not to mention special because it held the secret to our baby's gender (not to mention the 6 hour turn around time). Cannot wait to celebrate many more milestones with LGO and company. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is so dang good! I could rave about everything from breakfast to the pastry case but then this review would become ridiculous.   Coffee and tea are also delish. I'm telling you its all good!  We heard Jay-z playing today (Sunday), way to be hip LGO. :)"}
{"text":"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with \"it's just how we do things\" and \"there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little\". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner \"really doesn't care\". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Coffee is amazing. Try the Havana or the Mayan.   For the food, their \"I love you brooklin\" and their heirloom rice bowl is fantastic.  It doesn't hurt that people are always friendly and greet you with a warm smile."}
{"text":"Usually I love me some LGO but today I received the worst service I have had in a long time. I took some new Lgo-ers here after convincing them that they have the best salads and nice friendly staff. To begin...the cashier was very rude when one of the salads was asked to be made without cheese. Then after waiting over 25 minutes for our 3 salads there were no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long. The worst part of it all is when we complained about the wait, the manager was standing right there and said nothing!"}
{"text":"I work close to La Grande and yes it is very convenient however I have given up on going inside just because no matter what I feel like I am in the way and no I am never going to find a seat.    Yay breakfast until 5 Boo burnt coffee"}
{"text":"It was a little crazy during the morning rush.   - Cubano was tasty.  Bread was nicely toasted. Good proportion of mustard, ham, pickle, and cheese. Price was a little high for the amount of sandwich though.  - 9 Grain Tuna was  delicious.  Good amount of sweetness from the pickles and golden raisins.  Moist enough, but not soggy.  The green apples and cucumbers gave it a nice crunch. - PB&J was alright. Bread was a little dry and they were a little heavy handed with the jelly.   - Blackberry Dumpling was really tasty. You get a flaky crescent-like pastry with a blackberry base."}
{"text":"Food is good but expensive and very slow if something needs to be cooked. Cook very disinterested which is a shame. A better place with friendlier people would make a killing."}
{"text":"We LOVE LGO for breakfast! Their homemade English Muffin breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal. And their coffee is great. Perfect thing for my husband and I after an exhausting morning hike. We've also had some cupcakes and a red velvet cake from LGO and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that has an awesome lunch menu, a great selection of hard to find wines, a great selection of specialty drinks, awesome nick nacks, the best desserts in town (baked in house), and a great selection of specialty cheeses and salami, you have found nirvana!    I come to LGO at least once a week (on most occasions 3 times a week) and always walk out with a bottle of wine or some sort of cheese or baked good.  Their gelato, dare I say it, is better than Gelato Spot.   Overall great spot to come and enjoy lunch.    One complaint though: parking is a nightmare most times.  I hope they expand to a larger location with ample parking."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is one of my favorite breakfast places. I always try to make a stop here whenver I'm in the Valley. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a view of Camelback Mountain. The place always seems to be packed whenever I go, but that just shows how good it is. You order at the counter and can sit in the market, the pizzeria, or outside (be warned, seating is hard to find at peak times). There are two places to get coffee, one inside the market and one in the outdoor seating area. On top of serving good food, they have a small gourmet market that sells all sorts of things related to food. I had the daybreaker the last time I was here. It is an egg white omelet with turkey and tomato-avocado salsa on top. It is really good. It has a very fresh taste to it and it feels healthy, yet satisfying. I had bacon on the side, which was excellent. It was nice and crispy, as well as full of grease, the way bacon should be. Overall, if you're looking for a great breakfast place in Phoenix, head to LGO. I have yet to eat lunch or dinner here, but I hope I can next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so-so service too many pretty blonde Barbie dolls working, would love to see a little diversity especially in this day of age. Hate the parking, love the food totally cool store inside. Worth while, I believe so but not to often, don't want to support rich stuck up snobs."}
{"text":"Especially for airport options, thank god for LGO at Sky Harbor! The delicious margherita pizza was a tad heavy on the mozz, but better to have too much than too little! The pizzeria chop is lovely as well, with a nice balance of healthy veggies and savory (not so healthy) elements. (Hubby and I shared everything and def feel satiated.) Service is quick and informative. As far as airport food goes, this exceeds expectations. Who wants fast food crap when you can wait 10 min for relish real food?   Oh...and $5 glasses of house wine are also a bargain at PHX!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! They use fresh ingredients and the pizza is absolutely amazing. I have never been disappointed with anything I have eaten here. The atmospher is nice but depending on the day and time it can get pretty crowded. The price is a little expensive, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? This place amazing In every way shape and form!"}
{"text":"I got a gift certificate to this place. The food was ok. The place is disorganized. I'm giving this place a 2 mostly because of the snotty service. It was all teenage girls taking orders and repeating \"like\" and acting snotty. When I asked for an ice coffee refill, I was told it was $2.44. I said no thank you, and got the roll of the eyes. Also, the food is way over priced."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Mother Earth pizza. I wanted something plant based/vegan so I requested no cheese. The chef came out and asked me if I would like marinara sauce, since this pizza is usually not made with sauce. I said yes and thanked him for the suggestion. The pizza was so flavorful and had a variety of fresh vegetables. Best meal I've had in an airport in a long time!"}
{"text":"Seriously impressed. I had the vegetarian sandwich and it was full of flavor (and veggies!). Atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but that is because it is in the airport, which you've already forgotten because the food is so darn good you can't possibly be in an airport."}
{"text":"It only loses a star for always being way too crowded. I know, that's a crappy way to lose a star, but if I can't park and always have to wait in line you don't get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. A bit trendy, but they have take out if you want to avoid the pretentious/posers. The only reason I am not giving five stars is because parking is ridiculous! We love the food here, especially the Ruben sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, best cheeseburger and fries I've ever had in my life. The treats from the bakery are always fantastic. Will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat! A friend and I were visiting Scottsdale and this came as a recommendation from another friend. We were very pleasantly surprised at how good his recommendation was! We ordered the Parisian Toast (basically French Toast made with delicious crepes), Huevos Rancheros and a side of roasted potatoes to share. The Parisian Toast was so good, complete with creme anglaise and fresh berries. The Huevos Rancheros was also delicious and came with the most amazing, homemade English muffin I have ever had. I think that is what a cloud from Heaven must taste like. They do have packs of these slices of Heaven to take home! The roasted potatoes were nice, big chunks of potatoes that were perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I had an Arnold Palmer that was made with freshly-squeezed lemons. So good! We also got two cookies to go. I would highly recommend the French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie!  After we finished our amazing brunch, we did some shopping among LGO's grocery. From LGO-logoed gear and bottles of delicious wine to unique gifts/housewares and children's games, this grocery has something for everyone.   The only hard part about our LGO visit was the limited parking.  Even though you may have to wait for a spot, it is totally worth it!  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here all the time! Great food (complete with several vegetarian options) and fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"We're definitely going back. Be sure to order their English muffins and a pizza.  Thin and crispy and fresh! Excellent! We went on saturday morning for brunch and it was quite crowded. Luckily we got a space to sit. Looks like its a favorite of a lot of people! and for good reason."}
{"text":"LGO serves excellent food and interesting products. I remain disappointed every time with what can only be described as less than mediocre service.  They have more servers than most establishments but consistently make errors in orders and provide sloooow service.  I'd suggest that management do an efficiency study.  I realize that LGO's unique offerings makes it popular but I feel cheated in the remainder of the equation, service, whenever I brave the chaos."}
{"text":"When the parking lot's not full, the southwest corner of 40th and Campbell feels like a warm hug. La Grande Orange is such a cute little eatery/grocery, and it is nothing like I've ever seen in the Phoenix area (granted, I've been away for quite awhile so I'm clearly no expert).  I wished we hadn't been deterred by the $3 valet the day before, because when we stopped by the next day (with no valet in sight), I didn't want to leave. Everything smelled wonderful and I wanted to eat it all.  They also carry specialty beverages, wine, and the coolest little gift items for yourself or someone else.  To eat, I got the chocolate banana cupcake, which was delicious - still cool from the refrigerated display case, the cake was firm, yet very moist. I would love to go back for breakfast (which they serve till 5pm!), but alas, that won't be till the next time I visit Phoenix.  Also, I liked the bathroom. It is clean and well stocked with t.p. and paper towels. However, it did take me a sec to figure out the deceptively discreet flusher."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed again! I gotta get a better job....I actually miss sitting in traffic going to work instead of this flying for business. But we all gotta make a living.  So I had a couple of hours to spare and I figured by the time I get to my destination and hotel everything would be closed and I would end up up putting the feed bag on at the snack machine.  I found this place La Grange Orange. I think there another one in town. So I gave it a whirl. I had the BLT. Great!    Pros The food tasted great and was satisfying.  Staff was courteous and pleasant.  The bill was not expensive compared to most airport eateries.  The atmosphere felt like any eatery out in town. It didn't feel like a airport eatery.    Cons  No cons.    ."}
{"text":"Where to start. I will first say that these guys know what they are doing, and know their customer. The place works in Arcadia, would work in Brentwood, CA, would work on the upper east side of NYC. Would not work in Venice,CA, would not work anywhere else in NYC. Just way too Martha Stewart, boring, cute and safe. The music says it all to me. Always some Putayamo Cd playing some world music that all the soccer moms can tap their feet to. Everyone in the most expensive workout clothing, coming and going from a local yoga class, or a workout at The Village. Yuck. Yes, they know their customer, I am just not one of them.  Yea, I know that I am the minority, but this place just has no soul, nothing that makes you think, nothing outside the box. Its the kind of warm, cute, fuzzy place that makes me want to puke. For instance all the merchandising. A bunch of overly cute stuff that no one needs, and of course they put a big sign over it saying \"useful stuff\". Really? Can't you just leave something to the imagination guys? Is your customer really that brain dead creatively that you have to guide them through every step of your cuteness?  The crowd that hangs out here are just that, white, pretentious cattle. No artistic, creative types, no thinkers, no one that thinks outside the box.  No risk here. Very safe, and yawn, very boring. I was so uncomfortable hanging out there in that  bland, pretentious energy that I actually grabbed my food and ate it out in the car. Yep, thats the last time for me. Just not my kind of place. I do not buy artwork to match the color of my couch, and I do not need to eat a a place that tries way too hard to be cute and safe and makes me want to hurl. It is too bad though, because the food is very good."}
{"text":"This place is great but not if you have kids.  It mentioned on yelp that it is kids friendly, but they don't even have a table changer in their bathrooms.  I was there with my 2 year nephew and had to take him to the car to change his dirty diaper.  If you call a place kids friendly, you might think about accomodating and have a table changer in your bathrooms both in Potino and LGO."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. I love the store portion, lots of cute unique items. The food is freaking delicious. The desserts are amazing. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is it is a teeeensy bit over priced. Ok not so teensy. It is overpriced. We paid A LOT for 2 english muffin sandwiches(Which we loved and still dream about) But jeez louise! Its an english muffin sandwich! It didn't come with any sides or anything! This is a good place for a date, maybe a good place if you want to splurge a little bit for a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I recommend a few items in particular:  The Commuter breakfast sandwich -- the very best breakfast sandwich I have ever had, anywhere in the world. Eggs, bacon, fresh tomato, cheese, on a fresh-baked English muffin. I can't describe the taste -- it's just really, really good.  Mia's pancakes -- they're going light on the cream lately for reasons unknown, but it's still an excellent breakfast.  Chocolate raspberry muffin."}
{"text":"Best breakfast at sky harbor.  Quick with four registers open. The commuter sandwich is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I wish they could make me personal breakfast every morning !! The french pancakes are soo soo good.   The pizza I didn't really like that much. The crust turned me off.  Stick with the breakfast food!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I love this place! The food, the service and ambiance is fantastic. I do have a complaint however...I feel that management does not listen to customer feedback. Since menu changes seem to be regular it's tough on consumers that fall in love with menu items and expect what they've had before. Since I've been going to LGO they discontinued the white chocolate macadamia cookie, they also stooped making the chocolate chip walnut cookie, and changed the bread for the Cubano Hot Press sandwich to a ciabatta which does not do that sandwich justice from the sour dough they used to have. These are just a few things that I have repeatedly asked about and I get the same reply from the staff, they totally agree and tell me they hear that a lot. Sooooo....you would think something would change but nothing ever does. :("}
{"text":"Amendment to my original review: the flow of traffic throughout this entire space is bad and that's including parking.  Lines in several different locations in the restaurant cut the space and make it difficult to traverse throughout the restaurant.  The tuna filet sandwich (not the tuna salad mind you) with a side of fries makes it so worth it though."}
{"text":"The ice cream is phenomenal! They use natural ingredients instead of the flavorings. Their strawberry flavor has quite a refreshing taste and I personally love their chocolate since it's rich and has more of a savory flavor."}
{"text":"Get there early or in off hours, because this place - from what I observed- can get insanely busy. I just happened to come on a Sunday morning when there was a sort of \"lull\" but that quickly changed. We ordered our breakfast at the counter and found what may have been the last 2 seat table left. I ordered the eggs rancheros. The eggs came with shaved Parmesan cheese and ranchero sauce, fruit and an english muffin. It was the best english muffin that I have ever had in my life. Homemade, delicious, and soft...it was to die for! I have to go back and buy a package of them to bring home. The food was ready in about 6 minutes. We got our coffee from a different counter. It can be confusing in there and very hard to hear when they call your name (we missed hearing our names called for our coffee so they sat on the counter for a long time) and the small isles make it tricky to navigate around people...but people do it...daily...because it is just that good."}
{"text":"In Terminal 4, Gate D. For airport food, this is the best I've had! You can't really compare airport food to outside food because, really, who WANTS to eat at the airport?! You eat at the airport because you're stuck there.  This place deserves the extra stars because I would actually eat at this place even if it wasn't in the airport, which I can't say about any other airport restaurant, except maybe one. I've spent  A LOT of times in airports! Trust me on this one. The food tastes extremely fresh and they have healthy options. I had the MOTHER EARTH PIZZA (full of delicious veggies), the mini cookies (they recommended the sea salt chocolate chip one, but the CHOCOLATE COOKIE was much better!!), the homemade english muffins (good, but not worth the $9 for 6), and the cute little ding dong things (good).  Definitely top 5 airport restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"I or someone I have been with has gotten food poisoning 3 times from this grocery/pizzeria.  That's 3 separate occasions, I have stopped going here at all!"}
{"text":"Ordered the burger.  Very tasty with a soft and light sesame bun.  Fresh shaved cheddar is served on the side, along with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and dill pickle slices. Fries are shoestring size with skin on and served in a paper bag.  Expensive (but tasty!) airport burger - $14."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for coffee and to get lost in books they have for sale. I am completely shocked that not only is it a coffee shop but it's mixed in with a grocery, gelato, pizzeria and almost Urban Outfitters vibe all mixed into one. Only down side is that if you just want coffee you have to order in the main line which could get busy as well as parking is a headache mostly every time I've been. Otherwise I've had their mocha and their breakfast burrito substitute the tofu for bacon cause I'm a meat eater and both were AMAZING!!! Also love their candles!"}
{"text":"New Guatemalan blend is my favorite. :-D  Mmmm!   I'm here way too often, but I like it."}
{"text":"How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable \"grocery\" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)  After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!   The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.  I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Phoenix for less than two weeks and LGO has already become our go-to. Their bircher muesli, blueberry muffins, sour cream coffee cake, homemade nut milk lattes, and chocolate chip sea salt cookies are worth writing home about. Not only is their food top notch, the environment keeps me coming back. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Long time patron from the beginning . I have not been in awhile.. that being said, was disappointed tonight . Great server , but the $14 burgers and fries were a miss. BUrgers were small, were not Pink / Medium as requested , and fries were too saturated in oil and soggy .. in fairness to LGO , they offered to comp deserts , but we had already walked over and bought them. Will try again and stick with pizza , but for driving 25 mins , was a miss"}
{"text":"I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day, Christmas and \"just because\" cards and notes."}
{"text":"Great food and have been going there since it opened.  The Pizza is really good and the Commuter hits the spot for breakfast.  I recommend LGO to everyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten majority of their menu and haven't found anything that I haven't liked.  It's a great place for any meal.  My boyfriend is more a breakfast person and I'm more of a lunch person so this place is perfect for us.  I love their avocado pizza - we did it with proscuitto once and it was fantastic.  The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer.  The white sangria is probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  For dessert, the red velvet cupcake is unbelievable - the frosting is the best part.  The parking kinda stinks but you can always park across the street at arcadia room and walk to LGO.  Can't say how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Never had a bad meal from here. My favorites are the commuter sandwich, the avocado pizza and the sea salt chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place, only food i have tried is the pizza and was very good. some neat stuff in the market area.   was very cramped, long lines and was a pain to get seated. not to mention parking was slim and none.   its one of those places was glad to check out once but thats about it for me."}
{"text":"I love this place, and I love introducing it to friends! The pizza is amazing!!! So good, you have to try the margarita pizza, loaded with fresh basil, they aren't stingy  Great atmosphere, and the bakery....yum."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit LGO often ...maybe TOO often! But I just can't get enough of this little place. If you're looking for a trendy place for a lunch with friends, or even a dinner date, this is it. My favorites are the commuter with salmon and avocado, and the cheeseburgers. The cheeseburgers are amazing...and I don't even LIKE cheeseburgers. I also enjoy their Arnold Palmer's! Hands down, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Love the neighborhood vibe!  I'd recommend skipping the gelato though."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is a Phoenix foodie institution...simple fare and baked goods done to perfection is a cool, artsy setting. everything is fresh and flavorful and it is fun to browse the market while waiting. Absolutely charming."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Super duper friendly and kids are welcome . Service is awesome .denfinaly should go there"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger medium rare and it came out well done.  Terrible.  They have a limited menu after 5pm. Fries are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Loved having La Grand Orange sponsor our Phoenix Workshop with their delicious pastries! Best way to start off our mornings!"}
{"text":"Great Place! Order the cheeseburger! It's perfectly juicy, crispy, cheesy and with it's crisp cut fries it's the best burger I've had!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good.  You can bring pets.  That's about it.   Don't go on the weekend for breakfast the place is a zoo and SUCH a hassle.  You have to wait for your order to be called out, carry your food through masses of people, and find a seat in the loud dining area or usually messy patio.    I'll give it another try, but I like a RELAXING breakfast. Not a \"popular\", hip place with a large quantity of annoying people and limited parking."}
{"text":"This rating is solely for the chocolate, gluten free cookie!   Not the chocolate chip! Just the cookie that is completely brown like a brownie!  This is the love baby conceived by a cookie and a brownie. The shape is, of course, a cookie. But the texture is chewy like a brownie, has a crackly top like a brownie. There's even walnuts like a brownie. It's the best cookie I've ever encountered, and believe me I've had my fair share of cookies!   And if this should be categorized as a brownie, it's the best brownie I've ever encountered, and I've also had my fair share!   I often book flights with connections in PHX, just to get this cookie! I'll walk from any terminal, just to get this cookie!!   BELIEVE ME!! I think it's Gluten Free too and I'm not even about that life!   They have it in the large size and also baby sizes. Both are equally good!  The place also offers sea salt chocolate chip cookies, butterscotch cookies, etc.  All are really good but none compare to the chocolate cookie.  Next time I'm in PHX, I'll edit this review with pictures too! :)  In terminal 4 or D"}
{"text":"Highly unorganized. Servers too busy and stressed to help first timers. Staff bitching at a customers for parking in to-go parking even when they were picking up to-go orders?? Negative energy all the way around. Even some customers were getting frustrated at the service. Chemistry was just off avoid. I highly recommend places like the original Chop Shop in Scottsdale or Modern Market Eatery for similar menus. Every time I'm in one of those places people are happy and enjoying themselves. Good energy"}
{"text":"My husband loves, loves, loves the smoked salmon salad. When ever we are down from flagstaff we have to stop here. Outdoor seating not great but at least there is some."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  They have the best Chicken salad sandwich i've ever had in my life! If you're in a hurry this isnt the place to go. It's always packed but thats a good thing! it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Cream of mushroom soup = to die for Seared ahi bowl = great dinner  Housemade Chai Gelato afterwards.  I had all of the above the other evening and I was a happy bunny. :)"}
{"text":"Man, I *love* this place!!! Great atmosphere & crowd. And I just heart the Venice Beach Burrito (sans tofu) with a delicious croissant for weekend breakfast with Earl Grey lavender tea or a decaf Americano.  Good vibes always on the overhead. I was able to bask in the sun at an outdoor table, enjoy a leisurely meal, write in my journal, and take in all the people (& dogs!!!).   Totally dig this place!!!"}
{"text":"Lah Grand Orange?  Lah Gran-day Orange?  Lah Grann Or-hange?  I still don't know how to pronounce this place but whatever.  LGO it is.  The point is that I totally didn't expect to find pizza of this caliber at an airport.    Yelp said there was pizza here and that's all I needed to know to make the (loooong) walk from Concourse A to Concourse D.  I figured it would be one of those places where you point to a pre-made slice (sunning under a heat lamp for who knows how long) and wait for them to reheat it in the oven.    Instead there was a guy behind the counter flinging crusts with flour all over his apron.  They did have a display of pre-made pizzas but since they were out of cheese, they made our pizza fresh to order.  It took about ten minutes for it to come out.  It was a thin crust pie...nice and cheesy without being oily.  I got a stack of napkins to blot oil off the top but didn't even need to use them.  There were tiny chunks of tomato in the sauce and the sourdough crust had a satisfying crunch.  The pie was large enough for us to split but only because we were saving room for gelato.   The Mint Chunck (their spelling, not mine) was delicious too.  I was expecting a mint toothpaste flavor but instead it was earthy.  Bits of real mint were mixed in with broken slabs of chocolate (stracciatella style) and it was surprisingly good.  Again...not what I expected in an airport.    My only complaint about LGO was the lack of seating.  They had a cute caf√© area out front but every seat was taken...too many of them by people who weren't even eating...reading newspapers, typing away on laptops, watching phone videos.  Fortunately, there were two open seats at one table and the people sitting there invited us to join them.    That aside, it was an enjoyable meal.  We'll be back to LGO on our way back through.  If we can find a place to sit next time, I will bump to five stars."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. It's a zoo! I'm originally from New York so that's fine with me. If you can't handle crowds, this place is not going to be the place for you. I went and had lunch with my family the first time and the food was great. There are so many vegetarian options. I had a kale salad. It was really good. The second time I went, I just had desert. It was awesome. We had the lemon bar, a salted chocolate chip cookie and gelato. It was heaven. The lemon bar was super tart. The cookie had a lot of salt and that brought out the chocolate and the gelato was very creamy. They also sell a lot of fun chachkis and books. I liked looking around the store."}
{"text":"Things seems to have gone downhill. In the morning this place is disorganized and wait times for food can be too slow. I find the food to just okay and nothing like their restaurant in Arcadia. I now only come here if I am desperate."}
{"text":"This is one of the best quaint  \"morning energy\" spots Arizona has to offer. 5 Stars for bringing this market style vibe to one of the nicer communities in Arizona--Arcadia. I love the Rueben, but not all the food is equal to the price. But here's the point: It doesn't matter. It's a great community hotspot (not a far stretch to say up and coming landmark)  that sets itself above most all other choices. Set up your Wi Fi, enjoy the music, the aromatic sense of entrepreneurship, thriving families and a laid back regal approach to your morning brew."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is great. Had breakfast and the 2nd visit a burger. The atmosphere is really cool too. Here on business would come back."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite breakfast places near Tempe. Although it is a little frustrating when it is super busy(which is majority of the time) it is well worth it. And for a college student, it a little out of budget so I only go here when the parents visit or to treat myself!   I am obsessed with the chocolate pumpkin muffins.  My only thing is I feel like I see people that have ordered really cool dishes yet I never see them on the menu? Am I missing something?  Great food, entertaining atmosphere, couldn't ask for more"}
{"text":"Cool local place to grab a breakfast sandwich, coffee, something for lunch, bottle of wine, or a cookie.  Lots of neat gifts and books.  Staff is friendly and service is great even if it seems a little chaotic.  Borderline overpriced but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Their wings... oh, those WINGS. So good! The pizza is stellar, too. Can't say I've tried anything from the grocery section (like sandwiches 'n stuff) but those homemade english muffins look incredible! Friends have said that the yogurt parfait dealies are crazy good, too.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date, with friends, whatever - it works! BUT, parking can be tricky at night. Haven't done the whole valet thing, but I'd prefer to park the car myself. I'd probably bike there if I lived in the area.  The attached grocery is bizarre at first (grocery, wtf?) but totally awesome. The small space is packed with unique products, retro items from your childhood, wine that you can bring into the restaurant (or order from) w/o corkage fee, and overseas stuff, too (like Haribo Frogs which can be hard to find here). It's fun to peruse after (or before) sitting down in the restaurant.  The Grateful Spoon gelato, right next door, is also fantastic. Only complaint was the waffle cone was stale, but the gelato itself was nice.  Overall, when we make a trip from the East, we usually end up here."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE place, and I have been coming here for years (although I should mention I always stick to breakfast foods...I like the items I get too much to branch out). As a self-proclaimed muffin connoisseur, the blackberry bran muffin is my favorite muffin of all time. That being said, the other muffins are typically marginal at best, so if you are in the mood for a lighter breakfast, I would suggest the brioche bread or go with one of their english muffins. Mia's French Pancakes are delicious and I also really like the granola and yogurt. Since switching their coffee brand, the coffee is pretty great, and I suggest the iced coffee.   As others have mentioned, parking is really limited and can ruin your experience. Avoid typical lunch hours (you will def. have to valet), ad weekends tend to be crowded too."}
{"text":"I've flown through Phoenix several times and never would have given this place a second look if I hadn't spotted all of the great reviews on Yelp. I got a gluten free Mother Earth pizza (easily large enough to share if you're traveling in pairs), a cup of fresh fruit, and an iced tea for a little under 30 dollars. The pizza crust is great and the produce tastes fresh. Great place to stop if you have an hour or so to spare between flights- like others have mentioned, it's not a place to grab a speedy snack."}
{"text":"Frequent LGO-er. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Parking continues to be an issue, but the proprietors have made strides in improving the experience for drivers. Ideal for neighbors within walking, biking distance (thank goodness!). Whether breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee or dessert -- LGO is an easy choice. Chef Cole Turner's desserts are A-MAZING. Try the peanut butter pie."}
{"text":"Interesting place, crazy busy in the morning. I had the jersey girl omelett. I had to go online and look at the menu to remember what I ordered. In looking at the menu I just realized I didn't get the toast it's supposed to come with! Well, check your order, other than that, decent breakfast. Tries pretty hard to be trendy."}
{"text":"I like the food okay but the service--geez, very rude girl at bakery counter!  If I hadn't wanted the AZ cookie so badly I would've just walked out.  There's better (and closer) bakeries than this one."}
{"text":"So Sorry U decided to change bakers.Your dbl choc choc chip cookie was the BEST. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING you have now compares to it.Please see if you can bring it back. We also love Chelseas kitchen. we R usually there 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"This is another great place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The parking is quite difficult."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give it such a high rating but I truly cannot find a reason not to.  I started visiting just to pick up the Tammie Coe coconut cupcakes (amazing), then would get espresso - very nice - huge cups for a little drink (fun). Finally I ordered a sandwich to go. The Turkey Stack. Wow, delish! The bread was wonderful, turkey great, perfect avocado, havarti and mayo/mustard was a great combo. I look forward to returning and trying breakfast.  Parking is a nightmare. My kids love the old fashioned Cupcake that looks like a hostess cupcake. The gift store is very cool.  Great wine store.  Nice patio for pooches.  I wish I lived in Arcadia."}
{"text":"I'M SO HAPPY!!! To have La Grande Orange in terminal 4! I had a wonderful green chile cheese burger and craft beer. The boys had lovely pizzas. Makes those pre-flight jitters so much easier to handle. Looking forward to breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything from here.  I have been here over 20 times and everything has been top notch. I could seriously eat every meal of the day here."}
{"text":"Great salads and unbelievable pizzas. I spend a lot of time in airports and it's very rare to have the same quality food and service at an airport location as the original restaurant. Definitely worth the walk to D gates."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange has the best food! I got a Mother Earth pizza and I added chicken! Best idea ever! My cashier was very friendly and helpful, thank you David! The manager, Naomi came by and personally checked on us, we chatted about our trip and she offered our son a sample of their gelato, Great customer service and great food makes this the best restaurant in Sky Harbor"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best for Breakfast...and cant beat the Tuna Melt for lunch"}
{"text":"We loved this gem of a restaurant!  What a great concept for this type eating establishment located in one of the busiest airports.  Lots of healthy options with a great selection of (not so healthy) yummy baked goods."}
{"text":"Whether its their sandwiches, salads, pizza, sushi, breakfast, brunch items, pastries, iced tea, smoothies or just the english muffin with their house jelly, you cannot go wrong with anything that you order here. I have tried most of their items on their menu (sometimes just for a change) and have I been satisfied every single time. Since I travel for work, I am glad they are now open at PHX Sky Harbor in Terminal 4, Gate D. This place is surely as good as it gets !"}
{"text":"love the casual atmosphere and light food, great coffees"}
{"text":"I bought a cake for my husband's birthday and it was one of the BEST cakes I have ever had! The pastry chef there is one of the best! Also since I am a last minute planner I called the morning I needed to pick up the cake and they made it no problem for me to pick up at 4pm. I will be definitely getting all my desserts from here!"}
{"text":"I start my day here, and sometimes end it here too. Great service, great food and drinks and wonderful place to be with community. #lifeisbetterhere"}
{"text":"My husband and I love having breakfast here.  Such a cute place with delicious food keeps us coming back.  The atmosphere is lively and  it's a nice way to start the day."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch before spending the afternoon at the Desert Botanical Gardens. Crowded, but didn't take too long to order. The wait for the sandwiches was at least 20 minutes, standing in a very crowded store. I loved the ambience and feeling of the place, but the food service was slow, and the (homemade) veggie burger kind of fell apart upon eating.  But a cool place nonetheless, would love to try the pizza sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.  My staple is the veggie sandwich - it's fabulous, and the pickles they serve on the side are divine!  Only 2 negatives for me here - the noise factor (they play music really loud, plus lots of people), and the crowd/parking issue.  This place is popular (for a reason!) and parking is always an issue.  I usually just call ahead and do the car pick up for this reason, but I wish I could park easily and stay and linger.  They have a really fun shop with pretty unique items, and I do enjoy browsing there and hanging out.  But parking is so difficult that I just content myself with the food to go."}
{"text":"Though it sucks to have a layover on a relatively short flight from LA to Albuquerque, this restaurant made the layover in Phoenix more than tolerable.   Thanks to Yelpers, I chose this place over several other seemingly attractive options and found a very unlikely food option in an airport. The place was a bakery, pizza spot and sandwich spot all rolled into one. At times, this can be bothersome, as specialization is key, but again, it's in an airport.   My wife and I were in sandwich mode and looking for something hot and we both found good options. I chose the Cubano hot pressed panini and my wife the hot pressed tuna sandwich. The prices were more reasonable than I'm used to from airports at about $7.50, so this provided some comfort.   When the food came, my cubano looked delicious and the taste did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I'd say a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles would be a more accurate description. My wife too liked her sandwich.   We had some cookies too and found them good, albeit sweet as all hell.   I'd seek this place out again if stuck in Phoenix in the future."}
{"text":"So you're flying out of PHX and after passing thru security you see La Grande Orange.  Guess what, you win!  La Grande Orange at PHX is a staple in the valley between the Tammy Coe cupcakes and the awesome pizzas and salads this place comes up a winner.  Jump in and be grateful your gate is here.  Have a safe flight!"}
{"text":"Great place for meeting friends.  Good eats.  The english muffins are amazing!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast, although it gets pretty crowded and parking can be a nightmare.   Solid kitchen, good dish selection, all in all a great place.  Why 4 stars? A little too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Had a great  experience last night at the LGO in the airport.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.   The manager was courteous and efficient as we were ordering oir food.  Great experience.   Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Any time we need a connecting flight to the West Coast, I'm picking Phoenix. Because this place has the best gluten free pizza I've ever had. They need to patent their recipe and sell it to all the other restaurants that are trying to make GF pizza. DH says his regular pizza was darned good too.  Be warned, the GF pizza takes a while. It is not something you can order and get while your airplane is boarding!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Wednesday.  The parking lot was packed, but I was on my motorcycle so parking wasn't a problem.  BTW there is free valet parking at lunch time for the car folks.  There are two entrances one in the front and the other through the kitchen.  The kitchen is organized mayhem.  several cooks and a small army of helpers cooking, cleaning, and serving the delicious dishes.  I like that they expose the kitchen where patrons can see their food being prepared.  You know it is a clean environment,  the ingredients are fresh, and prepared with an inventive sense of style.    This is a busy place.  I was apprehensive at the long line of automobiles in front, and anticipated a long line for to order my lunch, along with a long wait to eat.  I was surprised at every turn.  The grocery  store was interesting with some offerings from local artists presented in a humorous fashion, a little wine store with really pretty wine bottles and no price tags.  I perused the menu, placed my order with a friendly cashier who explained the process,  was seated at a small table  and eating in around 10 minutes.    The menu offers vegetarian, vegan and gluten free food.  I ordered the Guacamole BLT.  The sandwich was served with a pineapple slice and sliced pickles.  The guacamole raised an otherwise run of the mill BLT to a new level.  I think I'll try the Venice Beach Burrito on my next visit.  Who wouldn't want to try tofu chorizo after all?  The grocery store opens at 6:00am then at around 4:00pm the place magically turns into a full service pizza place."}
{"text":"I'm a little befuddled as to why I haven't reviewed LGO yet. There must be a reason. It's not like I haven't been here yet. As a matter of fact, it's the opposite. I've been here many, many times. But still not inspired to write something. That strikes me as a little odd.   Anyway.  This is reviewing just the grocery/cafe part of LGO - the pizzeria deserves its own review some other time. Now, if any of you are familiar with San Francisco, there's a small upscale grocery mart near Dolores Park called Bi-Rite, which is right by the pizzeria for Delfina, which in turn is right by the Tartine French bakery (and also the Dolores Park Cafe). I don't know exactly when LGO opened here in Phoenix, but it seems to have mushed all these concepts together and came up with this establishment. When I first walked in here 18 months ago, I thought, \"This is odd. It reminds me more of home than Phoenix.\" Varied wine selection, high end pasta and sauces, open chaotic kitchen, the list goes on. Except for the bit where they sell useless candy (marshmellow Peeps are and ALWAYS have been nasty ass) and dumb books on how to name your dog or cat (I mean, come on, if you really need a book on how to name your dog, should you even have a dog in the first place?).   But on the flip side, playing great CDs from the Putamayo record label over the soundsystem is very Bay Area, and when I came across some San Francentric books - cookbooks for the aforementioned Tartine and Delfina as well as Chez Panisse and the SF Farmers Market), as well as SF's 7x7 Magazine, I became even more suspicious about where these guys were getting their ideas from.   Up until this point, I've just described what it's like walking in here. Eating here is another story. There's a small side patio which fills up pronto around weekend breakfast time. No misters over the summer though so I guess people just bake outside, since there's only a tiny smattering of two-tops inside and a couple more out the front door. If you're here for weekend brunch, the line is usually out the door and someone will come by to take your order. A decent selection of dishes, from croque monsieur to healthy all egg-white omelettes, but nothing I've eaten here has ever been out of this world (sometimes bordering on bland). I've never had the sandwiches for lunch, though, and I'm going to guess that they're better than breakfast, but I'll cross that bridge (and maybe edit my review) when I get there.   That said about the food, the coffee is pretty damn good, I'll hand them that much. However, there is a sense of chaos in the place when you have to pick up your food order from one counter and your coffee order from another.   As for the scene, well, much can be made of it. LGO is located smack in the middle of Arcadia, and sure you get some uppity folks driving in their Mercedes convertibles, and this seems to be the reputation that LGO is saddled with (for better or worse) - but by and large almost everyone who eats there is just regular and unpretentious (otherwise I would have never returned after that first time).   In the end, though, I'd say this about LGO: it's a pleasant place to sit outside on a weekend once in a while (if you're lucky enough to nab a table, that is, and it's not too hot). Inside, the store is stocked with a lot of interesting and upscale and sometimes useless stuff you'll probably never buy. The breakfast food is fine, but for me not worth all the effort of the wait and the table/parking sharking. The coffee, though, is excellent, including their famous Spanish lattes.   However, since LGO seems to be one of a kind in the Phoenix metro, many people just keep coming here by default, and I do find there's a lot of unjustified hype about this place. Maybe it gives off a certain \"aura\". Who knows. I just know the next time I go back to LGO, it will be on a random day at 3 in the afternoon, with a parking space waiting (hell, MANY parking spaces waiting for me), no line of people whatsoever inside, an open table indoors, a leftover but complete Sunday New York Times, and an excellent sandwich which is destined for my mouth.  Oh, and no Peeps on display. Especially those pink ones. Because they're nasty.  But I'm in no hurry to be back. There's still the rest of Phoenix metro to explore...  3 stars,"}
{"text":"Monday Morning - take out  Room for improvement -  - same curt, terse service - too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale - food was average, but not worth all the fuss this place requires.  + I like the food for the most part and you can't go too wrong with a red velvet cupcake...can you?  This place is all fuss and hippity dippity so i surmise that is the situation with the crowds.    I am sure I will be dragged there again by another friend in that neigborhood so I will try to look with new eyes.  :)"}
{"text":"Sure, you could hate on LGO for: -the difficulty of finding a parking spot (although people are always coming and going, wait 2 minutes and someone will vacate a spot or there is ALWAYS parking across the street) -the crowd or occasional snobby worker (more often than not, the people are friendly and I don't wait more than 5 min to order even though the line looks daunting) -the \"our dishes are good and we know it\" high prices BUT, if we're basing the review of LGO on food & experience: 5 stars.    My biggest complaint would be the vegetarian sandwich, but I lived and I learned and I don't order it anymore.  Looking for something veg?  The sweet potatoe sushi roll, vegetarian breakfast burrito, and the mother earth pizza (which can be made vegan and/or gluten free) are all great choices!    Other highlights: the commuter sandwich with turkey, the AMAZING pizza, and their splendid iced green tea (or anything else from the coffee bar).    But finally, I dare you to taste a Tammie Coe pastry that doesn't blow your mind.  The best is the Ooey Gooey cupcake - don't be led astray by how good the red velvet looks, just get the Ooey Gooey, TRUST ME!  If you're feeling dangerous, the Old Fashioned (which looks like a hostess cupcake) is wonderful, as are the cookies and cakes.  If you're not a confection kind of person and you can resist the pastry shelves, move due south within the restaurant to the Gelato shop where the ice cream is equally as delicious as the rest of the food!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I know the Arcadians love LGO, but I just don't get it.  Average food,  horrible parking,  distracted and aloof staff.  Ingos and Chelsea's are so much better.  Better food,  better choices, better hospitality."}
{"text":"Oh the English muffins. So good.  The way English muffins should be; soft a little sour and buttery. Not at all dry like you get at the grocery store.  I also had the orange juice, which was very fresh and very delicious and the French pancakes a.k.a. Crepes.  The crepes were pretty good but nothing special.  The fresh fruit is strawberries which are very fresh and it goes well with the creme fraiche.  Beware of crowds on the weekend.  Good thing the offer complimentary valet because parking was crazy."}
{"text":"Besides the frustrating parking situation, it's a cool little place. They have \"hard to find\" trinkets from your younger days.  There are some unique gifts to shop for. As far as the food goes, I had the Roasted Corn pizza (really good but burnt on the edges, hard to chew) and the chopped pizzeria salad. The salad was made with (white, iceberg lettuce & a LITTLE pepperoni & artichokes, 4 grape tomatoes & maybe 3 olives). Seriously, with an organic/fresh/Heath promoting place ... WHITE ICEBERG LETTUCE!?!???   And by the way ... TWELVE DOLLARS FOR THAT ICEBERG LETTUCE!"}
{"text":"Parking SUCKS. Everything is over priced.   It took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I wouldn't have minded the wait if someone had acknowledged my presence and given the polite \"I'll be with you as soon as possible\" report. Clearly, that was too much to ask for.  But if you happen to go when it's not busy (i'm not sure when this is...) I'm fairly certain the ambiance would be delightful. It's an interesting concept. Also, the spaces are WAY too tight for the type of traffic they have in there.  The gelato on the South side of the building is really bland and boring. I'd rather eat store brand ice cream. Their Pizza is really awesome, though.  Great idea - mediocre execution."}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast place.  I've never had something here that I didn't love. For breakfast I recommend the eggs any style with fruit and toast (the fruit is always fresh and amazing, also add the bacon, they give you a TON and it's perfectly cooked everytime), the commuter sandwich (but you must add cheese, avocado, & bacon AND get it hot pressed), and the french pancakes are phenomenal if you're feeling something sweet.  For lunch I recommend the kale & quinoa salad, the vegetable sushi roll with goat cheese and sauteed veggies instead of raw fish, the Reuben (AMAZING!), and the burger. You can't forget an iced coffee and sea salt chocolate chip cookie to top of the meal... It's an unbeatable combo. The staff here is really friendly and there always seems to be cute dogs hanging outside, definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"My friend Kelly and I met at LGO last night for dinner.  I've heard of their wonderous pizza, and was excited to try.  I had the feeling that I was going to be traipsing into another restaurant haunted by the annoying hipster/emo crowd.  And I was right.  I saw a 45+ year old woman carrying a metal lunchbox purse.  Need I say more?  Good people watching, but stay and eat while you gawk!  Ok, first of all, if you haven't tried the sangria, you really should.  It was light and very refreshing.  They have white sangria in the summer and red in the winter-ish months.  We started with the shrimp ceviche, which was a delight to the senses -- reminded me of the Moroccan gazpacho from Pita Jungle -- but just a CRAPLOAD more expensive -- $13.  It's served with hot sauce (which really made this a killer) and tortilla chips.    For dinner Kelly and I split their pizza special -- it had heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh mozzerella with a balsmaic reduction.  Pretty much a caprezze salad on pizza.  It was HEAVENLY.    The service was pretty solid -- just maybe not as attentive as I'd like.    I agree with some of the other posters that the parking sitch can be a little tenuous.  It's a tiny parking lot, with tons of people trying to get in, so be warned.  The grocery was absolutely charming, but rather overpriced.  If you love funky candles, this would be a great place to look -- tons of choices, but again, they're a little pricey.  All in all, this would be an ideal place to take friends or family that are visiting.  LGO is just the kind of place you WISH you had in every neighborhood!"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!  I come to get one salad every single time I go, the kale and quinoa salad. Well they ALWAYS mess it up when I order it to go, and then I get home and don't want to go back. So, I decided to give their pick-up service another chance. Well..now I am just mad. When I am dining inside it's always on point, but the quality of food and service for the drive up to-go is seriously lacking!!!   Just spoke to Blaire who was so helpful and professional! I will be back"}
{"text":"Have you ever moved somewhere and then looked around at the surrounding communities and wished that you had selected the next street over?  Or the next town, closer to work, etc.?  I've been very fortunate since arriving in Arizona.  Phoenix, AZ 85018 has always been my neighborhood.    My ex picked a condo near 36th and Camelback 6 years ago.  Then I lived in a funky, cool condo community near Campbell and 44th.  And now I reside within a minute walk of La Grande Orange Grocery (pronounce it LGO, much easier) and the original Postino Wine Cafe.  I purchased my home 3 years ago because of the community, the location, the possibilities of what the lot/home had to offer AND because of LGO.  The idea to have my business located here, Space Massage Studio,  came about after living here for a year or so.  That's another story for another time.  I appreciate the uniqueness that La Grande Orange offers to the neighborhood.  When radio Milano was open (now the Arcadia Room), it was my favorite for noshing because of it's ambiance, service and location.  It's amusing to hear/read of so many people that drive here from Glendale, Chandler or even Scottsdale and are frustrated that they cannot find a parking spot, on a Saturday!  Really?  This is a neighborhood, meant for biking & walking.  LGO is not a mall.  I will say that if you find a spot within a 2-3 minute walk away, it's worth it.  Slow down, enjoy the stroll."}
{"text":"It's like a non-country, trendier version of Cracker-Barrel. Cute, cozy, filled with nicknack's and plenty of charm. On the downside, it can get a bit crowded, and there is not much parking, but overall- it's a nice local spot  with plenty of delicious goodies to try.   Tip- lots of good wine to choose from!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!!! I have had pizzas that were great!! The green chile burger is to die for....and oh-so-yummy sangria.  Love their cute little market too.  Con:parking can be pretty crappy and it gets really busy during peak times....expect to wait......  Oh....and do yourself a favor!!! Get a bag of their hand-made english muffins...wow!"}
{"text":"Just about anytime I'm flying on Southwest, I make a point of dining here. Don't judge an airport establishment by its management. When I'm looking for something lighter, I'll go for one of their salads which offer the added benefit of not creating a cloud of odor should you take the leftovers on the plane with you. If the salad is not your thing, try one of their burgers. And make sure you have it served on one of LGO's fresh baked English muffins. The one an only time that I had an issue with the food that had been served, the manager himself brought me the rectified order, apologized for the mistake, and offered me a bakery item. In short, even though this particular LGO is managed by HMS, you can expect the same food that you would expect from La Grand Orange in Pasadena and almost the same level of service."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's been our go to place for some time now. Realized I had not reviewed it. The food is always delicious and made fresh with high quality ingredients. Everything here is excellent- we went today for breakfast and it is so good that I always neglect to take a picture this the half eaten meals! Also later in the day they offer pizza and burgers that are really delicious!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to eat. Need to post pictures later but it's sooo delish, I forget to take a picture. This is my treat every trip, I'm a flight attendant. I love THE COMMUTER sandwich anytime of day. The bacon is so crispy and they are NOT stingy!!!! I also love the CHEESEBURGER- I choose to get it on an English muffin. Mmmmmm. The salads are also exceptional. The TURKEY salad, is amazing! The Kale (add chicken) salad is a flight attendant favorite. It's good but I love the other stuff too much.  IT IS PRICEY, but worth every penny ;) They also have a stamp card, for $10 off after every 10 purchases. Basically a FREE meal if you frequent often"}
{"text":"I used to go everyday and get their Kale Salad with Quinoa.  It is very tasty but the main problem is that when I want to add protein to it in the form of chicken, it tastes like crap.  Their chicken is stringy and has that gross chicken taste.  So I usually will get the boiled egg on the salad but prefer to have chicken.  If only they would grill some chicken that they could add to their salads.  Also the thai chicken salad which has a delish dressing would be good except their chicken on it tastes like crap.  Not sure why they have this problem.  Also, for health conscious people like myself and a lot of Arizonians, we like to know what we are eating (calories, fat content etc) and they refuse to provide this info.  When I asked for it, they said that if they provided it people would stop eating the food.  Their coffee is still amazing and the pizzas are great if you feel like the calories.  But healthy/organic is not their concern, so I go to Flower Child up the street now instead!"}
{"text":"Five. Fat. Stars.  LGO (as I learned it's called in PHX) is just about one of the cutest spots I've ever been on my various trips to Phoenix. Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!  It's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here.   Racks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!  There's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste!   I especially loved the reversible shopping totes! The fabric so so gorgeous on both sides that your real dilemma is not about when to use the tote but which side to feature!"}
{"text":"Love the food, key lime pie is delicious not to mention the pecan pie.  Alexis in the coffee bar is a fantastic  employee, very attentive, cordial and full of good suggestions."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Coming here makes me feel like I am in a real city. I love being able to buy all those rare drinks, waters, wines and little trinkets. The restaurant is just as amazing as well and the customer service is always above and beyond."}
{"text":"Heartbroken the roasted corn pizza is gone. Not a good decision. Bring it back plllleeeeeeezeee!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything is delicious. My favorite breakfast place! I came here today for a rotisserie chicken sandwich which was amazing & I can't ever leave without an A to Z cookie. Great energy & vibe every time I come. It's worth driving out of your way to this place!!! For breakfast my 2 top picks are: The Croque madame or the French pancakes."}
{"text":"I only come to La Grande Orange for my red velvet cupcakes. They are the best! I always judge a bakery's abilities on how well they can make a red velvet cake. There's a thin line between red velvet and tasting like chocolate and so many ones fail. But la grande orange has mastered this art! I always recommend this place for sweet treats and everyone has loved them. I can't speak on much else in the store or restaurant but the staff is very friendly and there's a lot of neat stuff to look at inside."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the guacamole BLT. You won't regret it! There's about a pound of bacon in this sandwich making it well worth the price. The cold brew coffee is delicious as well. Parking is a bit of a nightmare sometimes but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza's are made fresh and they will make you forget that you are in an airport!  Sea Salt Chcolate Chip Cookie is HUGE for the price and you must come here if you want a cheap bottle of water.  Everything is very affordable, especially for airport food!"}
{"text":"Kale and quinoa  salad at the airport???? Yes please!  The helpful Southwest agent recommended that I run down to Terminal D to grab a healthy lunch. Apparently I don't strike people as the Pizza Hut personal pan pizza type. I digress.  The helpful staff patiently answered my OCD ingredient questions. My kale and quinoa salad was made with fresh sheeps cheese, sunflower seeds, red pepper, grapes and a lemon-pepper vinaigrette.  SO GOOD!  The vegetarian sandwich with harvati and goat cheese also looked delicious, as did a number of other menu items. I will DEFINITELY be back the next time I'm flying through Phoenix!   Ready to sit through my three hour flight with my belly satisfied rather than about to throw up from a greasy food overload. I arrived at my destination feeling healthy and light!  Oh, and it's worth the walk down to terminal D  for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy shit...the first bite of my burrito filled my mouth with the most incredible flavor! Omg this breakfast burrito is delicious!! Add Cheese its perfect!  Probably the best burrito I've ever tasted and I've had a lot on my 22 years of living in PHX. Geez I gotta go this burrito is off the hook, it cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh and they use high quality ingredients.  Their pizzas are really good.  They have great gelato."}
{"text":"Good place go grab a bite to eat at Phoenix airport.  This is a small chain (mainly in So Cal).  Place can be crazy though since there are not many dining options at the SW gates..."}
{"text":"Corn pizza, pizzeria chopped salad, wings, kale salad. Everything is so good! Just lower your prices for the store - they are WAY too expensive."}
{"text":"I go to LGO Grocery EVERY time I go to PHX.  It has a very special place in my heart.  The breakfast food is spot-on, every time.  The French Pancakes, which I never get but always get a few bites, are quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten for breakfast.  With the fresh cream and honey, they're near perfection.  I always get the eggs and bacon, because they prepare them so well, I'm never disappointed and I pair that with a fresh-made english muffin, that will absolutely make you question your assumptions about carbs - because you'll never be able to pass one up, once you try it.  The place isn't inexpensive, but you do get a lot of food for your $$$, so it's worth it.  I have been literally dozens of times over the last year + and it has been great every time.  I love this place.  The service is always friendly, it's a GREAT hang-out, especially after a nice quick hike up Camelback.  The bathrooms are clean, and very spacious, the parking is sometimes a pain, but it's worth paying for valet if you have to.  Whatever it take, just go."}
{"text":"Because 169 reviews just isn't enough...   We all hate the parking though it's nice that they at least offer complimentary valet behind the store. Sure you still have to tip but that's easier than the headache you'll get from trying to find a spot.   Obviously this place is well loved. I live just up the street from LGO and it is one of my favorite lunch spots. It's a little cramped and slightly overstimulating but that's what I love about it. It's always fun to browse the shelves and stands to see what new loot they have in for the upcoming holiday. It's also great for people watching.   My favorite menu item is the Reuben. Wow, I didn't even know I could like Reuben sandwiches until I tried LGO's. I constantly crave it and it's so filling I can eat half for lunch and half for dinner. It also comes with a small side of fruit, usually strawberries and diced apples.   I recently tried the commuter sandwich with smoked salmon and avocado. I truly love their English muffins. They are really well done and fresh. I have to say I wasn't overly impressed by the sandwich but was still satisfied.   P.S. They have toffee dishes out right now with free samples. It's good stuff. After watching several people put their hands in the bowl though it seemed a little less appetizing. Still worth the risk."}
{"text":"Chickpea lettuce wraps were good, but also VERY spicy. I also got a latte with soy milk which was delicious. 4 stars just because I was not prepared for the level of spicy that the chickpeas lettuce wraps were and they were almost impossible to pick up and eat. I ended up eating them like a salad. Definitely better than the average airport meal."}
{"text":"The pizza here is top shelf. My brother actually slings the pies at LGO on the weekends, so I'm a little biased. If you're feeling adventurous, ask him to throw an egg or two on your pizza. It takes a little longer, but it adds an awesome little extra protein fix."}
{"text":"Food - 3 Price - About right Service - 3 Cleanliness - 4  This is obviously a very popular establishment with a strong following.  Overall a very cool concept and a place that I would frequent if I lived in the area.  I wasn't too happy with one of the cashiers but whatever, she seemed irritated that I lined up from the side as opposed to in front of the cash register and she wasn't very helpful especially given that I was obviously here for the first time.  I just walked away from her and got back in line.  I don't care for attitude while on vacation.    The second time around was better.... first of all, who waits til 4pm to serve burgers?  WTF?  So we got a few of their pre-made salads and some breakfast food.  Overall the food was very good quality and tasty.    I also had the Havana Latte... sounded good but their espresso is kinda weak so it didn't complement the drink.  In any case, it seems like a solid establishment."}
{"text":"This is a huge staple of mine every time I am in town. I quickly order a vanilla latte, and blueberry muffin if I'm just finishing a hike, or if I am in for breakfast, poached eggs! it is simple the best I have ever had! They also have the most amazing sea salt chocolate chip cookie that simply CANNOT be over looked. I have had dinner here as well and the pizza is superb, love the sourdough crust, and enjoyed the avocado and prosciutto pizza. Great beers on tap, and quick, happy servers. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"I have never had an english muffin like theirs! Absolutely amazing.  The food is high quality and you can tell the difference.  The only problem is finding seating."}
{"text":"Well... good ol' Gabi K took me here for lunch a few months ago (THANKS GABI) and I've been back for lunch several times since. It's the kind of place I want to hate just because I want to hate hip, cool, yuppy crack dens. And La Grande Orange is totally a yuppy version of a crack den! Think about it. What type of stuff  = crack for wealthy suburban white people? Here is a list:  Gelato Cupcakes 2 Hour lunches on a Tuesday Green Tea Crap with Fennel Gourmet Pizza 3 hour lunches on a Tuesday Multi-Grain Bread Avocados lunch dates tuna parking lots full of hybrid cars lunch (in general)  So because I am a self-loathing suburban white chick - I friggin' love this place!!!  Now who wants to have lunch?"}
{"text":"My first trip to AZ was a real treat when I was taken to La Grande Orange Grocery. Charming from the moment you start driving past it! Lets get the not so cool things about this place out of the way first...  Cons: -Parking lot is silly small for how popular (and amazing) this place is. Although, this well NEVER deter me from going here. Even if its just to grab a quick coffee.  Ok.. now that I really sit and think about it, that is the only Con to this delightful establishment. Walking through the shop you can find the most darling and useful items including: funny/witty random items, coffee mugs, to go cups for iced drinks (a MUST in AZ), t-shirts, books, art, calendars, magazines, etc... You can also purchase cold beverages outside of the restaurant or coffee bar and they also have a huge selection of wine for a small store. I purchased a darling La Grande Orange to-go coffee mug and if an art piece my boyfriend loves is still there when I arrive next friday.. I will be getting that for him.  The coffee bar smells amazing and even though I have only had one  iced toddy (AZ friends, i'm catching on ;))  from them, I am in love. The barista was super knowledgable and friendly and guess what ? She managed to not screw up something as simply as an iced beverage. I also purchased a bag of their Organic Ethiopian coffee. It is sitting in the apartment in AZ just waiting for me to come back! They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant. They offer lots of quick fast goodies to take on the go as well as breakfast options for all of us loungey-coffee/brunch/patio-with-our-laptops people. ME.   While I was there I dined in the restaurant and our experience was great. We ordered cocktails while we waited for our table and they were fresh and delicious! So nice to have a real drink outside of UT. We were seated quickly and our server was very helpful, friendly but also very laid back which I love. We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing, a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks. As we finished up our dinner we walked around the shop one more time to take in all the amazing random stuff they sell all while a great AZ storm was starting to brew outside.   This place is amazing. If you live in Phoenix you should be addicted and if you are visiting, you better make a special trip. Or two."}
{"text":"The salted chocolate cookies are the most fabulous things I have ever had. I could eat them everyday! They have tammy coe cakes which are jst as beautiful as they taste.  I love their french pancakes they ate sweetened with honey and strawberries and topped with creme fraiche delicious!!!!!! When I step into this place its like going to a french cafe.  I used to live there so I remember what those places were like.  I live a block away so I go a couple times a week its just fabulous!!!! The wine selection there is wonderful...the staff is friendly.  Its nice because they have curbside pick up if you want to enjoy your goodies at home...you can also stay and enjoy at nice little table inside or on their cute patio.  Its nestled in the heart of arcadia you cannot get much better!!! Try it you will become addicted!!!"}
{"text":"LGO is usually always a 5 star rating for me. It's my home away from home. It's been a love of mine since my teenage years in my beloved Arcadia neighborhood. This 2 star rating is for one reason and one reason only. The reason: 2 words, ROASTED. CORN.   Why, why, WHY has LGO ripped my heart out by ripping the roasted corn off the menu?! Not in season?! This is AMERICA! CORN isn't even a part of the dirty dozen! There's plenty of CORN in the U.S. to please the masses and bring back our beloved roasted corn pizza. I'm pregnant and all I'm craving is a sweet, savory, buttery, delicious roasted corn pizza. I call every week, ask, then hang up when they tell me the roasted corn isn't back yet. It hurts. Last night I was forced to go to Flower Child (bc still... no roasted corn) and it wasn't very good. It never really is. I miss LGO but I have to stay strong and boycott until they bring back the all mighty roasted corn. Every Saturday, when I go to the grocery store and walk by the LOADS OF CORN (corn that would go so beautifully on an LGO pizza), I weep, fall to my knees, and yell, WHHHYYYYY?!!!!!!! Damn you LGO. DAMN YOUUUU!!!!  Yesterday, after I ate my crappy flower child wrap, I posted on my Facebook about the roasted corn pizza saying, \"WHERE ARE YOU ROASTED CORN PIZZA\" and, YEP, you guessed it, an influx of comments and likes came pouring in about how THEY TOO are up in arms over the kidnapping of our precious roasted corn pizza. 40 likes and 17 comments to date.   So tell me LGO hospitality, WHYYYYY?!!!   Until we meet again, roasted corn. I will be dreaming of you. And calling LGO every week, along with the 16 friends I've rallied on Facebook who are equally devastated.   And like Mumford and Sons say oh so perfectly to our unique and heart-wrenching situation, \"I Will Wait, I Will Wait for you...\"  With love, Your adoring fan, Nicole Smith"}
{"text":"ate here thursday, chopped turkey salad was bomb.  big, fresh and good.  nice dressing   great service and quick.  tables are clean with charger plug.  nice prices are good and they have everything you would want - sandwiches, pizza, burgers, soups, salads, wraps, baked stuff  only thing bad here are the cookies - the cookies look amazing but taste like crap - dry, crumbly, too salty, just not good - and I am a fat guy who loves his cookies - i seriously bought every flavor of the big cookies at $2.75 each - they all sucked, took a bite of each and threw them all in the trash  bummer all else good though"}
{"text":"Rude, greasy,  asked how big burgers, regular, not 1/4 pounds, 1/2 pound nothing...REALLY. Asked what kind of beers... not 2 on tap and cans of bottles over there or list them... NO... REALLY So $23 bucks later, greasy burger, beer and the fries real with skin, pretty good.  BTW, if I had seen pre-made sandwiches I would have gone with that!!!  Airport food sucks, if your gonna rape my credit card make it good!!!"}
{"text":"Best sea salt chocolate chip cookies ever!"}
{"text":"I'll just add my 2 cents on how fun, happening, and great this place is. The coffee totally awesome. The bakery items impossible to choose. I had a very very good tuna sandwich then noticed the pizza's on other tables and had to try it. Had the margehrita and it was spectacular. Gooey cheese, chewey crust, superior ingredients. The staff here from the pizza guy to the counter people to the clean up crew......very friendly, real, and beyond efficient.   The atmosphere here is just real comfortable and fun. A wide variety of seating styles......from indoor table , to community table, bar,outdoors garden, oudoors sidewalk, indoors amongst the grocery shoppers......  A very cool place.....can be difficult to park there sometimes but just presevere."}
{"text":"LGO is by far my favorite place for breakfast in the valley. LGO is the reason I live in the neighborhood! The only down side is the tiny parking lot fills up quickly, weekend mornings and most evenings for dinner. One reason I chose to move near LGO was so I could walk or ride my bike to breakfast. I have had almost everything on the breakfast menu, and loved everything. The muffins from Tammy Coe are to die for. I always stop in the Grocery to grab bread or cheese for nice dinners or even a picnic lunch.  Stopping by after work for pizza and gelato has also become a bi-monthly occurance in our house. The pizza is light, crispy with amazingly fresh ingredients (if you eat breakfast there, you will see the chefs chopping and preparing the fresh veggies, pepperoni, salami, etc. in anticipation of the evenings pizza and salad orders). I recommend LGO to everyone I meet, and it is always my dinner suggestion and favorite place to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"LGO has great pastries and cookies. Some of the best. I haven't tried the pizza yet but that is next on the list. Now this review has a big but. Sir Mix A Lot would love this review because of it's big but. I can not lie. I went here for the August Breakfast Club UYE. The breakfast sandwich I had was as good as I thought it was going to be. Their sourdough English muffins are great. Add bacon, egg and cheese to that and it is even better. Now here comes that big but I was talking about. They do not to breakfast service well here. It fact they don't do it at all. There is no service at breakfast. You can order breakfast sandwiches and stuff but then you have to go next door, stake out a table, go get your order when it is ready, then get your own silverware and water and coffee. After you are done they want you to bus your own dishes. The funny thing was that some people weren't picking up there food so someone would bring it over and track them down it give it to them. Hmmmm that sounds like maybe something they should do all the time. Probably a crazy idea. So I will come back for more baked goods and to try the pizza but I don't think I will stop for breakfast again. Maybe without a large group it wouldn't be so bad but still they need to have some kind of service at breakfast or close off the dinning room. Something needs to change."}
{"text":"I am stuck in the airport so I decided to have dinner. I have to say that I never expected a pizza to be good at the airport. This one was really good. They use local items and I was pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"LGO is definitely a staple in Phoenix, especially if you enjoy the Arcadia side of town.  Friday night was my 2nd visit to Le Grande, and I have decided that it is where self-proclaimed BOHEMIANS and HIPSTERS alike can come to UNITE!  We (my boyfriend + his brother's girlfriend + myself) waited about 30 minutes for our table, which is on-par for no reservations on a Friday at 8pm anywhere... no big deal.  While you wait, check out the GROCERY STORE!  (Think Urban Outfitters' quirky gifts meets baked goods at Bertha's Cafe... and let's not forget the fine selection of Vino from around the world) :)  :)  Needless to say, that kept three of us occupied until our table was ready.  The Gladiator Pizza is great for all you men too afraid to put anything green in your mouths -meat galore- .  The Avocado Pizza is what I ordered during my first visit, and it was just as simple, tasty, and amazing as I remember... Ladies and gentleman: the perfect amount of cheese, avocados, proscuitto, fresh basil, and lemon zest. Mmmm..  Two pizzas were more than enough for the 3 of us and we did a bottle of Malbec to complement it all.  Our server was very helpful with a great wine recommendation, and we even ordered Red Velvet Cake to top it off.  Maybe we just weren't expecting such a rich taste, but the Red Velvet was not something to go back for, or ever order again, in that case.  However, the gelato (suggested on the menu to complement the cake) was phenomenal.. it was Almond flavored with a tart raspberry? swirled in and a hint of lemon zest.  By the way, they make their own gelato in-house and you can even stop into the shop and grab some if you're not looking for dinner or groceries.   All in all, LGO has a great Portland/San Fran vibe to it and food/wine/dessert/merchandise to boot!  So stop reading and GO!!!"}
{"text":"This was always a great place to get lunch, when i was working at Skye Harbor Airport. It was a hike for me coming from the US Airways A gates; all the way over to La Grande Orange which is at the very end of the concourse.(by South West airlines). But it was so worth it.My go to choices were \" the commuter breakfast sandwhich\" ,  the \"kale quinoa salad\" or the chickpea salad.  The commuter sandwhich has egg tomatoe onion and a little bit of mayo. You can add salmon or meat, your choice. It comes on their house made english muffins which are huge.(the way an enlish muffin should be) if your hungry this is the sandwhich for you; its filling and delicious. The 2 salads are both vegan and delcious. And surprisingly the salad portion is sufficient. If your not ravneously hungry one or two  of the salads will make you happy. They also have a whole bunch of bakery items and some are vegan and a few are whole grain and healthy. All the food is made at the moment you order it. You can see the chefs moving about in the kitchen doing their  best whipping up some yummy food. They also make delicious pizza, which is also freshly prepared right in front of you. La Grande Orange is a little pricey. But if your particular about what you eat. Like myself and you want to avoid crap fast food. Take the time while your at Skye Harbor and cheque out La Grande Orange. They have got a little bit of some thing for everybody. And its all scruptious and filling."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee and food. Lines can be annoying and occasionally the music (although good) is waaayyyy too loud. Like nightclub loud and you can't have a conversation. Asked a staff person if they could turn it down a bit and she was totally rude about it and blew us off. Parking sucks but there is valet. Pizza is awesome. The place might be getting a little full of itself however. They need to realize there are growing alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"My fiance and I arrived on a Saturday around 10:30am.  This place was swamped.  I attempted to enter a door and found out it led to the kitchen... awkward... so we meandered to the side.   There is no method to the madness here.  It's more of a \"I really hope I'm in line to order some food\".  We finally make it to the counter, place our order and then walk to another counter that has a bunch of people standing around.  This must be where I get my food.   There are people walking around grocery shopping, getting silverware, ordering drinks from a second stand.  I peak into the other room and there is a sushi chef slicing up some tuna, I also see a pizza menu.  I'm laughing at this point, thinking that if I ever do get my food, we might just have to eat it in the car.  For some reason though, the stars lined up that morning.  My name was called, I grabbed my silverware, and walk to a newly available table (the only table available in the pace).  I sit down, exhale, sip my espresso, and dig in to the most delicious and simple breakfast.  Poached eggs with prosciutto on english muffins.  So simple, so well executed.  Perfectly cooked.  It was like the madness was in slow motion at this point.  I look up at my fiance and tell her \"I really like this place, we'll be back.\"  She agreed with me and we are making plans to come back for pizza and dessert."}
{"text":"Not into the long drawn out reviews. This place is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE JOINT in town. You can eat anything from a great pizza, to sushi or the best omelette n town. The daybreaker is the bomb and so is the spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"Their pizza and salads are some of the best that I have ever had. I have had their pepperoni pizza, the margarita pizza, tomato and italian sausage pizza. I have tried all of their salads and they awesome! I make a stop into this tasty terrific joint ever few months. Best time to go is a little before 5 to avoid the dinner crowd which can give a wait upwards of 25 minutes. I do not recommend the Sangria as it has no flavor! There is a small gelato parlor that is connected to the restaurant for a sweet treat after dinner if you have space in your belly."}
{"text":"I go to La Grande Orange almost every day to get a green tea I also occasionally get their quinoa bowls. Love the atmosphere and staff too."}
{"text":"What do the Fallen Angel, Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie and Chips and Dip appetizer all have in common? They are all amazing and best of breed. I'm glad I don't live close enough to go here every day, or I would. LGO is the best pizza in town and the best bakery in town, hands down."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of LGO and what they put out so I was super happy to see the one opened in Sky Harbor. It was breakfast, but I wanted a sandwich. i got the stacked turkey sandwich that came with avocado and bacon, and it did not disappoint. the sandwich was stacked super high with quality ingredients, I was a happy camper. It was to be expected though, since I'm a super fan of LGO's pizza and other goods at their regular locations. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Gift shop, sandwiches, salads, incredible baked goods, coffee bar, pizza (evenings only), breakfast and gelato. Too many choices to pick from."}
{"text":"Oh yum... The green chili hamburger is sooo tasty and served with French fries! Now to indulge in the decadent chocolate brownie!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on my birthday for Sunday brunch - talk about diving right into the deep end! It was busy. Buuuusssy. But, food was good, coffee - delicous, the pricing was slightly high for my budget (so not an everyday place).. the only downside really was the chaos that is ordering/paying/waiting for your food during a peak time. So just be prepared for that & a lack of parking."}
{"text":"This place definitely doesn't need my help, but I have to support my neighborhood go-to, LGO. It's a bike ride away and very dependable. I love the crepes and my boyfriend loves the Commuter, and we choose this as our breakfast destination because no matter what day of the week--the food is consistently fantastic.   I have also returned in the evenings and tried the pizza which is another success. I'd say the only thing I didn't love was their sangria. It was a little sweet for my liking, so I like to opt for the generous bloody mary instead.  ALSO--cutest shopping selection in the \"grocery\" part of the restaurant. This is the place I go when I need to pick up a gift, but don't know what to get. Simple and unique.  The curb side service is a nice, convenient touch as well."}
{"text":"Ok, let me first start by saying that this place is truly a gem. The pizza's are absolutely delicious and the service was so Friendly!!! Yes it deserves the emphasis of the capital \"F\"! I had the Roasted Corn Pizza, which was so good, it had roasted corn (obviously) goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, and Fresh basil. It was truly divine! The two other people I was with had sandwiches, they too declared satisfaction...The boutique style market is very quaint, but did seem spendy so I avoided it...The dessert's looked beautiful, but I did not buy...Visually they looked dreamy....The iced tea did have free refills which was also a positive (considering the $2 price tag)...so here is the reason it only got four starts....the parking lot is absolutely horrifying there are 20 spots (maybe)!!! And to be honest $13 for a relatively small pizza is a lot IMO...the sandwiches were also pricy...but of a once in a while visit I think I could justify it."}
{"text":"Love this place! They've got great food and ambience - just a perfect place to sit outside, grab one of their honey lattes, and anything to nosh on. Love the Tammie Coe offerings! Favorite salad here, their Nicoise. Favorite sandwich, their Croque Madame. Favorite breakfast, their Birchemuesli. Also love the little knick-knacks they've got goin' on everywhere, just adds to the funness. Pet peeve - ocassionally coffee is not consistent, does get ridiculously crowded - and parking's a real hassle. But if you're in walking distance, then you're all set!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome... it makes me forget that I'm in Phoenix sometimes.  While I can't review the whole menu, I know their yogurt, orange juice, and coffee is awesome!  Service is usually really good and friendly, and the fact that you see a lot of the same people there a lot means that they're probably keeping more than just me happy.  Check it out next time you're in the area... driving, cycling, or walking."}
{"text":"I could have just gotten lucky, but I just seriously got the best damn burger and best fries I've ever eaten at an airport. What a pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"I know that saying something negative about this place is like calling your baby ugly. With that said, I think we may have an ugly baby here. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming factors here, but for the most part I think that there might be a bit more hype than anything going on these days at La Grande.  I went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as \"phoenix\" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read \"LGO now open in Santa Monica.\" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.  While I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.  I know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a hodge podge of different things, all of which are wonderful. There is a store front with t-shirts, home goods, beauty, etc. Additionally, La Grande Orange is also a pizza place and good for salads and sandwiches as well. I really love their tuna Ni√ßoise salad. The desserts are also very good. Try the camelback bars or the old timer. The tropical iced green tea is also really good and refreshing on a warm day."}
{"text":"Cash registers went down and the staff all of a sudden became clueless.. The kitchen was halted with no orders. It took over 10 mins for someone to figure out that you can still take an order by writing it down...  And the \"manager\" ahem, totally useless and unfriendly to all of us customers that were patiently waiting for 20 minutes..."}
{"text":"Morning OJ?? Yes please!! I wish I would've had an appetite for something else. However, next time I will definitely make La Grande Orange my breakfast at the airport spot!! Just remember its past Security Check!!  Oh and I must mention that they always deliver AMAZING Service!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE LA GRANDE!!! It's a love that will last forever and Ever!!      -I know, kind of crazy, but true :)  This place hold many great memories, from high school times, till now. This is the perfect hot spot to meet up and then wait for the pizzeria to open!  For their ever soo deliciously great sangria!!      -However, My love is mostly for their style, service, products, Tammie Coe baked goodies, coffee, chai, sushi rolls, wine, salads!!  EVERYTHING this place has to offer!!  The view, oh the view, while a bit obstructed, but still visible Camelback Mountain beauty and the overall ambiance of this place. So magically jolly yet calm and enjoyful!!  A MUST visit when close to this area!! I sometimes stop in after a hike, and don't get any weird looks or anything if wearing my workout clothes!  Yes, they offer take-out too, but the best part is being there to enjoy it all fully in its full state!"}
{"text":"Pizza usually takes 10-15 mins to make but it's fresh & hot. Love the kale salad and gotta order an mini AtoZ cookie for dessert! I love that this is location in Terminal D at Sky Harbor. There are always lines here so if you're in a rush to connect to your flight, watch out. It could take 10-15 minutes since most items are made to order.   The grapefruit sunrise bevy is fresh and tart. But the small is a bit pricey for $3.00."}
{"text":"This is a very interested restaurant/grocery.  You can order food TO-GO, order a latte at the coffee bar or go right next door and eat a nice dinner. It's also a grocery store where you can pick up dinner or pre-packaged lunch options. They only serve sandwiches until 5pm.  I saw an array of desserts too, but wasn't able to try them.   The bread here is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"such a neat spot. consistently great food... try the hot wings, gelato, & cheese pizza"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan dalai lama to go at this grocery shop/pizzeria. It was really good pizza, loved the cashew cheese, the mix of toppings and flavors they combined and the crust was really well done. They have walk in pick up or curb side pick up options. I chose walk in since the grocery store seemed like a cool spot to check out. I looked around for a bit. They have cards and boutique type fare and they also have a coffee shop and gelato/pastries counter. Was not impressed by the service here. I stood at the counter in front of the gelato/pastry case for over 5 minutes trying to get someone's attention and no one offered to assist me. Finally I started looking around and a barrista at the coffee counter noticed me and asked if I'd been helped. I had been eyeing some sorbet flavors and a vegan apple cookie but since I got pulled over to the coffee shop I just asked to pick up my pizza. Over all not the best experience in the store but the pizza was excellent and I'm really happy I tried it. I'm not sure how their pizzeria restaurant service is."}
{"text":"Ok--It's airport food! You sort of expect it to be grossly overpriced, nasty tasting and surly service.   If that's your expectation, you're going to be disappointed.   Good food, moderate prices, and very friendly customer service. We got a chance to visit with Chauncy, who interrupted his lunch break to make sure our order was progressing properly. He's VERY proud of his place and justifiably so.   Green chili burger is PERFECT!  Just the right amount of heat and seasoning. Hot, crispy fries, all cooked to order.  All in all, excellent experience."}
{"text":"Cute down to earth grocery store/cafe & bakery. =)  It has a bunch of interesting books, wines, gadgets and whimsical little things to check out. They're a bit expensive as expected...   I was going to come here to buy a cupcake but there were only a few and looked like they had been refrigerated for awhile... so I was thinking they wouldn't be so great and didn't get them. Cupcakes were about $3-$4 depending on the type.   They also have a pizza cafe attached to them... which serves happens to serve some gluten free pizza!   Plenty of parking in their lot.  They also have parking space side pick up service with a smile. =)   Oh! And free wi-fi! Code wasn't required."}
{"text":"I love this place, and the wait is well worth it. If you are not a fan of waits, crowds or good nosh or novelty food, then La Grande Orange is not for you. But those among you with a versatile and educated palate will enjoy all they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to La Grande Orange, and it was wonderful. Seriously some of the best food to the most friendly and helpful staff. I had a great time, and forsee being this a usual dining spot now."}
{"text":"Their breakfast menu is awesome. It's a great place to go for good food and not spend too much money!"}
{"text":"BEST RED VELVET CAKE IN THE WORLD! The store is crowded and always busy but the food is worth the drive and hassle."}
{"text":"After eating here we both made a charge for the toilet!  The place was packed and parking was limited (valet parking is offered later during the day). But the food looked fresh and the staff was super friendly and helpful. The atmosphere there was very nice because you could feel the positive energy from the customers.  We ordered the hash and burrito. Soy lattes and 2 OJs (of course). The food was okay. When they called my name the chicken hash was missing so I had to wait for them to make another one (they claimed another customer might have mistakenly taken it). The chicken hash came in a bowl and the chicken did not taste fresh. It tasted like it was old meat -- like they shredded the chicken the prior day to prepare for the rush. Also, the yellow pepper tasted rotten .. like it was bruised and rotting but they just cut it up anyway and served it.  Then, it got worse. As we're driving home, we both felt a bout of diarrhea was coming. Something we just ate was not right.  This was the whole reason why I go to places like LGO -- for fresh products and cleanliness -- because I have worked in a restaurant kitchen before and I've seen all sorts of gross things that go on back there.   I pay extra to go to places like LGO, hoping that I would be served nutritious food on clean plates. I may go back to LGO for the drinks but will definitely avoid the food."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite brunch spots.  My husband and I just met some friends here for brunch, and as always, we ate delicious food.  I had the commuter sandwich with bacon, gruyere and avocado - DELISH!  My husband had an english muffin.  The coffee bar here is also very tasty, and their iced teas are delicious.  The only downside is that it is always very crowded, and parking is always difficult.  They have valet, but I tend to resent being forced into valet.    Don't forget to try the delicious Tammie Coe baked goods while you are here!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling on business and stopped in for lunch. Heard about this place from Phoenix New Times - Best of Phoenix. Great neighborhood hang spot everything on the menu looks good. Looking to come back and try some other items.  I did come back after 4:00pm to try the so called best chicken wings in Phoenix according to the New Times. Really, those are the best chicken wings. Those were just BBQ'D wings. Need to fry those babys to get that crispy skin. I did like the sauce, very tasty."}
{"text":"I have only been there once, but can't wait to go back there again and again!!! I had a delicious honey almond milk iced latte, turkey sandwich, and delicious cucumber salad!!!!  Everything looks delicious, and the staff are very friendly and make the lines move quickly!  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes tasty, health food!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with LGO. The breakfast/grocery store/dining room/bar layout is very interesting and a bit odd. The complimentary valet is considerate because, parking is extremely difficult in the small, front parking spaces. The white sangria I ordered was good, but small. The flatbread was not good.  I've heard the breakfast is phenomenal and I would be willing to go back in the morning. But I won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Ok, so mostly we just go to LGO to have brunch or lunch and it's awesome for that with a couple of important notes. First, be prepared to wait and feel crowded for a WHILE till you can escape to the outside with your foods and drinks. Once outside, finding a good table to enjoy at may be somewhat challenging or....just not possible. I've never tried to eat inside to my recollection. It seems pointless to eat in LGO where its wall to wall products and people when you could go outside and enjoy the weather. The food is always delicious. The menu is inspired but accessible and reasonably priced. On a side note, LGO is a great place to stop and pick up quality treats like breads, cakes, cookies, specialty sodas, beers, wines, cheeses etc. It's like a boutique convenience store for foodies and that is always handy. Too bad about the too cool for school crowd but I generally don't let them bother me. To be clear this review is on LGO Grocery only. Although it is adjoining and affiliated with LGO Pizzeria, I am treating it as its own separate entity."}
{"text":"I love Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. I fly out of here pretty regularly, and I'm always amazed at the variety of legitimately good local restaurant options here, as opposed to other airports where you're limited to fast food chains.   I'm a huge fan of LGO. Their sourdough English muffins are what dreams are made of; I highly recommend getting your burger on one of those bad boys. Life changing.  I had a 5:55 am flight out of PHX this morning, and luckily for me this location opens at 5 am sharp. I had the commuter sandwich with turkey and avocado ($9.55 + 0.50 to add avocado) and it definitely hit the spot. I ordered at the counter and it was out in less than 5 minutes. For those of you who love spice, they have a condiment bar with Sriracha and Tapatio and a variety of other hot sauces. The large cold brew ($5) is about 20 ounces of smoooooth strong (in a good way!) deliciousness. They have a ton of \"patio\" tables as well as a couple big communal tables with power sockets if you plan to hang out for a while. If you get a regular coffee - free refills. I didn't have any of their pastries today, but their cupcakes are amazing too :)"}
{"text":"Was their during lunch time, the place is self service till 4pm.  Got a turkey salad that was per-prepared and a ice tea totaling $11.   Nice environment."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite grocery/restaurants. But I recently heard that the kitchen workers wear no gloves when handling food! Very concerned about this."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I ate a Tammie Coe Black Velvet cupcake and it was so amazingly good that it's been all I've thought about since.  Today I ventured back in to LGO trying to recreate the heavenly experience but alas..NO BLACK VELVET CUPCAKES! Son of a bitch. I went with the Toffee Vanilla instead. Meh. Frosting too hard, cake was slightly stale. For that I take away two stars.  Lucky for me, LGO is about two blocks from where I work so I have every opportunity to stake it out until my beloved Black Velvet is back in that pasty case. Preeeecioussssss.....  Don't even think about coming here for lunch. Parking is a total bastard."}
{"text":"i always love coming here coffee is always good, and the grocer is always fun prices on items can be a little steep and parking is tricky! come early with the parking in mind  the food is always tasty and it is a great spot to find glutenfree and vegan desserts i can not say anything about the pizza as i have never tried it, but i hear it is very good when i come i usally by my procuitto and a few other items,  along with a delicious moca coffee they do offer curbside order so if you are in a hurry that is fantastic !"}
{"text":"We were at LGO this morning and as usual had great food and coffee. We have never sat on the patio due to the many dogs and being allergic. To my surprise we saw a wonderful sign on dog etiquette. I love it!! What a great idea and I wish all restaurants followed rules. Too many dogs are usually all over the tables licking everything, nothing gets cleaned and yes the staff always touch the animals. Ick... Hats off to LGO!!!"}
{"text":"Got the egg white and turkey omlet with the avocado/tomato salsa. It was awesome that they used a real egg. Everything looks like it was made today, not brought over pre-made in a Sysco truck. Good service. Good food. It was a little bit on the salty side, but for airport food, solid."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. The breakfast is great, they have an amazing stacked turkey sandwich, and tuna sandwich for lunch. The pizza is delicious and their chocolate walnut cookie is the best I have ever had! Friendly service and very good green tea!"}
{"text":"Love this classic Arcadia eatery, store, pizzeria concept. Food is consistent, items in the store are always changing for the seasons and they have really cute things. Now it does get crowded and they can get a little unorganized, but for the amount of people they serve, they do a great job. My one complaint about this great place is cleanliness. when you get your food you have to grab your own cutlery, fill your ice tea, get your own coffee Etc, This station is always dirty. When I was there yesterday,I literally had to sort through the cutlery to find a clean fork and knife. They were washed but no polished and there were chucks of old food on them."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great food and an incredible atmosphere. If I lived in this city I'd be here on a regular basis. It's a little pricy for the amount of food you get but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went again because this place is still A.MAZE.ING!!  Got the chick pea sandwich and was NOT disappointed. I ate the whole thing with barely even offering the Boyfriend a bite. He he he. He got a small bite.  YUM! Definitely going back the next time I'm in town ... again."}
{"text":"Nice service.  Has all the LGO faves.  Definitely a new fave for when I travel and thank goodness it's located in the SWA terminal!"}
{"text":"Love coming here.  Great service, neat little grocery area (more eclectic stuff than actual groceries), and the food is awesome (simple menu but delicious)."}
{"text":"Eating healthy is hard.   These guys had good turkey sandwich with avocado.  Large sandwich for the dollar considering airport overhead costs.   $10."}
{"text":"I've been here hundreds of times since it opened, and the non-pizza side is really going down hill!! Had my old fav, the croque madame, and as shown in the pic... thinnest bread that's not called a wrap I've ever seen. The pickle was thicker!!    My friend got a very dry tuna sandwich (how could a tuna sandwich be dry?!) The apples in it still had their stickers on... hoping they were at least washed!!  I wouldn't have posted this if the manager on shift this morning didn't brush it off and say casually that she would remake, if needed. If I was managing, I'd apologize profusely... comp the meals, and remake them to a satisfactory level. Guess we define customer service differently!!"}
{"text":"All of the pizzas are so good. The burger is great. My favorite salad is the kale and quinoa and if your going for breakfast try the commuter sandwich and a potato. One of my favorite places to eat. Everything is so good."}
{"text":"This is nothing like the LGO in Phoenix.  The food is typical food service airport faire.  Awful.  It is a shame they use the LGO name.  You would be better of eating at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, but when your employees are freaking rude and discourteous... I'm taking. My daily habit of eating out somewhere else. Please teach your employees how to talk to people especially the ones that do ur curb side service. . . Especially when it was done in front of other people .. people at your establishment need to learn some manners.  Ps create more parking."}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of being able to relax a few mornings away here recently.   Definitely a little piece of New York in Arcadia - it has the feel of the many gourmet micro-grocery stores there.  I don't go here as much as I should, so I reluctantly recommend it to the rest...   * loud and busy in the morning and lunch times * a very cool incognito back-door entrance * very brunchy menu selections (incl. a great croque madame, sandwiches, omelettes, muffins and tarts) * jazz, Gipsy Kings, and Al Green classics wafting over the loud speakers * grocery stocked with knick knacks, cookbooks, imported pasta, fine wine, freshly made sushi, and of course, The New York Times  And, yes, the Spanish latte is every bit as incredibly and sweetly decadent as described."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find the vegan apple pie-cookie hybrid. I have never seen anything like it - it combines the best of an apple pie with the best of a cookie. It was delicious, I wish I had bought more of them. I'd love if they had even more vegan options (I think the spicy chickpea lettuce wraps were also vegan) but I will be back hoping they regularly serve the apple pie-cookie treat!"}
{"text":"I love La Grande Orange. I recently moved to Phoenix and was delighted to find this place in my new neighborhood. Their 24-hour cold brewed coffee is refreshing and flavorful... not watered down even as the ice melts. I am excited to work my way through the many coffees, sandwiches, pizzas, and other menu items - - there are plenty vegetarian options! (They even keep vegans in mind and offer adjustments/alternatives on their menu.) I tried their signature english muffins for breakfast one day, on recommendation of many Yelpers, and they were amazing. I wouldn't pay the price for them every day, but they are a great treat to enjoy with a coffee out on the patio. Downsides: The prices are high. The service is inconsistent... I've been at the barista counter several times and waited for someone to acknowledge my presence. Luckily, when they do, they are nice and my order is up on the counter quickly. It is crazy chaotic most of the day, and gets difficult to navigate through the store without bumping into someone. Luckily, as you weave through the store, you get to look at all of the unique merchandise LGO has to offer, from the perfect handmade greeting card, the small but significant selection of beer, or the coffee table book you never knew you needed."}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance this morning after management reached out to me following my last review. BTW...that was very much appreciated. Thank you!!  From 1* to 4*!! The biggest difference this time was the crowd. Much better help ordering with less customers this morning. The food we ordered came out HOT and quick and tasted awesome. I'm still not a huge fan of the layout...a little crowded (even with less people) around the counters.   I will keep coming back if this experience is repeated."}
{"text":"Solid brunch/lunch spot. Their immediate presentation is a little overwhelming because everything looks good. Pastries are showcased front & center, with fresh baked goods and cheese to the left. Definitely reminiscent of Southern California. Menu black boards hang above the counter.   Went with a couple friends and did it up semi-family style. Highlights were the organic Ethiopian coffee (superifical, but really liked the built in heat sleeve coffee cup), namesake orange juice, jersey girl omelette, commuter sandwich with bacon & avacado, croque madame & french pancakes. All in all, made for a nice mix of sweet & savory in healthy but not excessive portions. Only slight disappointment was the chorizo breakfast burrito, which required lots of extra salt. Bonus was the celebrity sighting of Grant Hill (even though I hate Duke)."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting LGO and couldn't be more happy! I tried the vegan apple cookie and have to say that was the best cookie I've ever tasted! As I went up to order, they came right out of the oven so I got to score one while they were still warm. If you want to make sure that you get one of these, visit LGO at 8am as that's when the first batch is fresh (and they sell out pretty fast!). Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Edited - I am still in love with their sourdough pizzas and I am so glad they are also at the airport so that I can indulge there as well. When we went this weekend the valet service was much easier to navigate, and the service was very helpful. The caesar salad was delicious and my husband would not stop raving about his BBQ chicken sandwich (\"best sandwich I've ever eaten\")!  Just a few things to keep in mind: 1) Valet park. There is no other option. Bring a few bucks to tip. 2) Grab a menu and sit down, think about it, then go up to purchase (San Tan flat style if you know what I mean) 3) Purchase your food in the main area and wait to pick it up there, except if you're getting a pizza, then you'll pick that up on the other side (dining area). 4) Alcohol can be purchased from the bar and brought into the dining area. 5) Enjoy :-)  Loss of star simply because I think this could be better laid out for customers. There is a very small sign near the bar that says \"Welcome\" and gives sort of a rundown of what I said above, but it's still confusing. I'd also recommend putting the menus somewhere a little more accessible. This would help newbies, which I still consider myself.   Overall, wonderful food and friendly staff. Just prepare to be sensory overloaded by all the trinkets, huge menus, glimmering dessert case, etc - Be strong and prepare for a delicious meal!   *I was given compensation to try the restaurant again in response to my first review. The review above is 100% my own opinion and was not influenced in any way."}
{"text":"Had their red velvet cupcakes (the ones from LGO, not from the cake shop), and they're amazing!!! I had to bring some home back to CA with me. Really wanted to eat here too but the place was pretty packed Sunday morning. Will have to come back and try their food next time."}
{"text":"The english muffins are amazing. My usual order is the commuter with salmon. The sea salted chocolate chip cookies are to die for..."}
{"text":"Urban cafe - fresh, delicious breakfast. English muffins are rave-worthy. Had the Commuter Sandwich with smoked salmon and avocado - eggs were perfectly fluffy, and the sandwich was meal unto itself. Salads are fresh, on the lighter side. Staff is very fun and friendly.   The cafe also has a well-curated gift store with plenty of unique, fetching items - definitely worth a stop-in. As prior reviewers warn, lot parking is extremely limited at this popular spot. Free wifi and bar seating has a few outlets. Great music ranging from triphop to 40s, never a dull moment."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets.  Cute mash up of market, bakery, and pizzeria.  Best bakery in town.  As an out-of-towner, every year I make sure to stop in for a \"Commuter\" on croissant with a  vanilla latte.  The market includes local artist and unique gift shop items.   atmosphere, check wifi, check, friendly staff, check timeliness, check delicious, check  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. (Unless they run out of croissants before you get one ;)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you're feeling like something nice and facy, but not terribly expensive. I'm pretty sure this is one of the cutest little places and it's tucked away on a residential street right off of Camelback, too! Good sandwiches, soups, and breakfast items; Le Grande Orange also offers specialty bottled beverages, coffee and teas, fresh squeezed juices, and ready-made sushi. Very vegetarian friendly and within the same plaza as a wonderful Pizzarra (of same ownership), a gelato place (connected to the restaurant), and a Tammy Coe Cakes. I highly suggest getting something with fresh avocados since I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have ordered with it. Good for groups, dates, and taking your mother out on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The California.  The fries are delicious.  The staff and cashiers were really friendly too."}
{"text":"I recently moved away from Phoenix, Arizona. Now I reside In Dallas, Texas. This is the one place in all of Phoenix I truly miss the most. I lived within walking distance to Chelsea's kitchen, literally across the street. Same owners as LGO, a little further down the road, still in walking distance. I actually moved to the worst apartment complex in Arcadia just for this place!  I cannot describe my love for this place. When I try, it all comes down to that cold, ready to go salad case.  For 1 year I ate the shredded kale,evil princess Thai and tuna Ni√ßoise salad 5x a week on average.  The champaign dressing on the shredded kale salad is the best dressing I've ever had. During morning hours they'd even do a breakfast kale, hard boils egg addition To the grapes, red pepper, sunflower seeds, and Manchego cheese. The Thai salad has an  incredible dressing as well, fish sauce based, yum! The chicken is minced to get into every bite equally, the lettuce is perfect size, w/ red pepper, lemon grass, red onion. The whole salad comes together exactly how a salad should, you could eat it with a spoon. The tuna Ni√ßoise doesn't miss either.   Contains all the proper Ni√ßoise ingredients! Potatoes, green beans, capers, Kalamata olives, tomatoes.     Ok, so let's get on to those home-made English muffins. They are all the rage for a reason. Unbelievable. My favorite thing to do with them was to make a sandwich  with them using their perfect chicken salad they sometimes have in the salad case. They use their in house rotisserie chickens from Chelsea's kitchen and add the perfect amount of mayo, grapes, and spring mix. Small amount of the best dressing ever and a toasted English muffin, mouth orgasm.  The ginormous peanut butter cookie is ridiculously amazing. Never found a better one.   They have soup de jour, my favorite was the mushroom or New England clam chowder.   Everyone loves the breakfast, personally for me it wasn't their strong suit. I had almost everything but I cannot rave about any of it like I can with the salads. Still, I ate it a lot. The jersey girl omelette not on the menu was my favorite, it's like a pastrami sandwich in an omelette. The croque Monsieur was my favorite breakfast item featured on the hot menu. Open faced, grain toast, ham, egg and gruyere cheese with Dijon and bread n butter pickles. Side of fruit, Fresh squeezed o.j. Mmmmm..     Dinner: Besides the pizza, reviews in LGO pizzeria..  If available due to limited quantities, the rotisserie chicken melts in your mouth and tastes nothing like a grocery store. Half is $6 whole is $12. Get some sides du jour and dinner is ready and impressive!  This places motto should be, \"what recession?\" If you have never been here and want to fit in, come in work out clothes on Saturday or Sunday for brunch. Lol, it's like everyone's stop after a run or bike trip.   Even though the parking lot is tiny, hard to find parking, and easy to get hit (I was there like everyday, bound to happen, not my fault!.) the call ahead curbside service is great. I abused it.  The girls are great though, never had any problems with them, always cheerful and gracious of tips.    I miss you LGO!,"}
{"text":"The food is good. I tried an array of items from sandwiches to a variety of baked goods. The food was good quality, but a little on the pricey side.  Not enough that I wouldn't return. The only negative was the limited parking and the packed restaurant. The first time I went during what I would consider the late lunch hours and the place was packed. I lucked out with finding parking. The next time I went early figuring I would miss the crowds. I didn't.  The lines are a little confusing because the registers wrap around the store.  Overall, it's definitely worth a visit; good food and customer service, but I don't think I loved it as much as the hype around it."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok, probably should try the sammies next time or the burgers. There aren't a lot of options but I guess it wasn't bad, with water it costs 18 bucks though."}
{"text":"Usually, Southwest Airlines' gates have boring food, especially if you have an early morning flight. I was delighted to see that good ol' La Grande Orange has a huge restaurant/shop here. It's not a sit down restaurant so you can just purchase your stuff, wait to be called, and then find a random table.   It was early, so I only ordered a pastry and chocolate gelato. The morning bun $3.30 was warmed upon my request and it was sugary and good. The flavor of the chocolate gelato $3.50 was good, but there were too many ice chucks. They seem to have a good variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options."}
{"text":"Holy cow, sensory overload.  We stopped in for breakfast since we had to go to Postino that day (another story entirely...)  Do I want to get a shirt?  A knick knack? A notebook?  Order some cake?  Some breakfast? Perhaps a pizza?  What about a bottle of wine? Coffee?  Fresh squeezed juice?  And nevermind the fact we were there at 11am when they started offering pizza....people started to lose their minds.   There is a LOT going on in here.  Almost too much.  But to their credit, they definitely have their act together.  It could have easily been chaos but ordering and receiving our food went smoothly.  Once I recovered from the initial \"oh my god, what is going on here?\" shock, I ordered the Jersey girl.  It was decent, slightly watery, and for some reason it came with cabbage in it which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu and was a little odd.  My husband ordered the Zuni burrito which he found to be good.  I have to be honest, none of the food was mind blowing.  It wasn't bad....it just wasn't mouth watering or savory.    The coffee was satisfactory, the orange juice surprisingly good, unlike at other places here where I have had fresh squeezed oj, but $3.75 is a tad ridiculous for juice.   I have to say that I really wished they had other offerings for breakfast, while everything looked good, it wasn't anything I can't make myself or find elsewhere.  (Some of the options sounded just like what I make for breakfast every day)    I will probably drop back in some time to try the pizza out but I'm not in any real hurry to get back.   When I go out for breakfast or brunch I prefer it to be more leisurely than the LGO experience  3.5 for now until I can sample further menu items."}
{"text":"I went there again for breakfast recently and I'm afraid that I must downgrade my rating.  We were in line to order and only had two people ahead of us, one of the LGO girls approached us and recommended that we go outside and place our order with the barrista (AKA coffee lady) because it would be 'faster'.  So we did and ended up waiting for another almost 10 mins just to place our order.  Maybe she meant it would piss me off 'faster'.    The breakfast I received was barely room temperature.  The eggs were supposed to be accompanied with avocado which (technically) I suppose they were, however, I assumed that this meant more than 3 dice sized pieces of avocado.  I felt like Gulliver; was I growing or was my food just getting smaller?    I asked one of the girls who work at LGO if the three ultra-mini cubes of avocado was considered to be a normal portion, she just looked at me like she was coming down off a pot binge and said she wasn't sure and that if I was 'OK with it', I should just go ahead and eat it.  Duh...ya think?  I'm thinking she didn't quite make the cut when they were recruiting at NASA.   Then I went to the guy at the pizza oven and showed him my mini food and he just laughed out loud and asked someone to throw some more avocado on my plate.  Anyway, I finally ate my now almost cold and fairly flavorless breakfast and must say that LGO seems to be resting on its laurels.  The food quality is just so-so.    I think this place is just another case of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' with people thinking 'Everybody else is in orgasmic rapture over this place, I guess that means that I should be too'.  Well, I'm here to say that the emperor is buck naked."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. It is rather good food for airport food. While the items themselves aren't that memorable (burgers, sandwiches, etc.) the ingredients seem really excellent and the quality is high. If I need to eat at the Phoenix airport, this is where I'll go."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch. Very disappointed. Ordered caesar salad which was lacking in lettuce and cheese and for the price not worth it. Easier make it better or cheaper. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I love everything about La Grand Orange!!!!  I would like to review both the grocery and the pizzeria together since it was the entire experience that makes it perfect. I've been here a handful of times now and have been impressed every time!   First time visiting: I stumbled across the place so I decided to come in. I love the grocery area and the fun gifts. I bought some birthday cards and took home some Spicy Tuna Maki. The Tuna Maki was fabulous and I knew I was going to come back.   2nd time visiting: Went with my husband for breakfast. He had the burrito and I had the Daybreaker and we both shared an order of potatoes. All was good and tasted very fresh. The best part was my coffee drink, the Havana! Something about condensed sweetened milk makes any drink  tastes good.  My husband that is hard to pleas enjoyed the items in the grocery store too. He bought a few nik naks there during our visit.   3rd time visiting: Tried their pizza for dinner and OMG!!!! I swore on that day that it was the best pizza I've EVER had! We had the Magrherita and it was just divine. The buttery crust was the right level of crispiness and the mozzarella was gooey and perfectly melted. I am not a big salad person, but even the orange fennel salad that I had before the pizza was delicious!   We've also taken visiting family members here and they loved it too. I would like to find more places like this in Phoenix. So yummy and what a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I usually find a way to finagle a stop at LGO whenever I'm in Phoenix. It's those damn amazing english muffins. And the wine selections. Carbs and booze, they will always be my downfall.  Food wise, there's something delicious for me at every meal which is nice as a vegetarian. The spicy chickpea wraps are especially good since they are tasty and a little more virtuous than a regular sandwich. Back in my meat eating days, I devoured the cobb salad and tuna salad sandwich. In fact, I now have an expensive addition to Bubbies pickles solely because of LGO.  My sweet tooth is always very happy at LGO. The gelato case has lots of great flavors and usually many of them are dairy free. During the holidays, we had an apple cider sorbet that was out of this world. The baked goods are so sinful. A drug rep learned about my love of their pastries and cookies, and she started bringing boxes of the stuff to our office. And, well, I had to quit my job just to stave off obesity. (ok, not really)  I love their retail section too. Their marionberry jam is double what I would normally pay for a jam, but I'll be damned if it doesn't taste amazing with their english muffins The wine section is where most of my dollars go. They have a cool selection, and their prices are comparable to total wine. Staff is very helpful with suggestions, and I know I can get something off the beaten path when I go there."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! I love that they have so many vegetarian options. And their cupcakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"We ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner for about 3 month while our house was being renovated. They kept us healthy and happy and it's still a goto spot even after eating there so much. Love this place."}
{"text":"LGO recipe: combine equal parts wine bar and coffee bar, add a lunch counter and an Urban Outfitters gifts and trinkets section, mix in one gelato case, stir in patio seating, garnish with a dash of hipster, and serve with a side of pizza. Toss in a couple of dogs for good measure.   All jokes aside, LGO was one of the few places in Phoenix that lived up the hype. My guy and a I stopped by on our way out of town and spent a couple of hours here sampling different foods, browsing the shop area, and hanging out. Despite the confusion about ordering/seating and the massive line snaking out the door at 11AM, service  was quick and everything we tried was tasty- especially the chocolate-cinnamon latte and the pistachio-cherry gelato! The salmon toast is even tinier than the $6 price would lead you to expect, and the side of potato yanks is a must- douse it with sriracha for best results.    With wine, coffee, gelato, and full meals available, there's never a bad time to stop in and everyone is bound to find something they like.  Even if you find yourself here between meals, there is a refrigerated case with salads and sandwiches to grab and go."}
{"text":"Have you ever  dreamed about a restaurant you visited,, and wanted to go back no matter that it was 2000+ miles away? This is one of those. I want to go back, NOW. The pastry, the orange juice, the eggs. yum. you need to go and try it. I believe it's worth the money ( not cheep).  The only big down side is the lack of parking and line."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, healthy and fresh ingredients.."}
{"text":"It's often hard to find healthy choices for dinner in airports around the country but I found this place and had an outstanding shredded kale and quinoa salad.  At first glance in the glass displays, I wasn't positive how I felt about ordering a pre-made salad. Usually pre-made means it's been sitting there getting soggy for three days- but no way! It was fresh, delicious, and filling."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Have not had anything on the menu that was not delicious.  Favorite is the pizza, especially the avocado and prosciutto   Love the salsa and pimento cheese appetizer!  We had lunch there as well. Food was top notch although not understanding how to order in one room and sit in another was a little weird. Crouque madam was out of this world tasty.  Service even when busy is pretty good. Only reason not to give 5 stars is the lack of parking although they are getting better at figuring it out   Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza!!!! I also loved their gluten free double chocolate chip cookies!!!! Amazing!!! I wish I lived closer to them but it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2008. This place never disappoints. Great healthy choices everyday all day. Check out my Daybreaker egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms in the pic :) Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love that LGO is at the airport!  Great coffee and pastries.  Perfect for early flights!"}
{"text":"awesome place for everything. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert-- all superb here. The grocery side is also very unique and accomodating. This is a great place to bring a date or the family."}
{"text":"Great Food and great atmosphare!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, especially the cheeses:) The cold brew is also pretty good most of the time.  The place is pretty adorable. I really enjoy coming here, but the parking sucks big time.  There is \"free\" valet in the back, but of course you should tip.  I mean, does this place really need valet?? Also, I avoid this place on weekend afternoons."}
{"text":"Airport food. Nothing like getting heart burn before a long flight, eh? But, this place wasn't too bad! Had a burger and fries, cooked to order, and it was pretty good. OK... I've now officially written an airport food review. Wonders never cease."}
{"text":"The Commuter sandwich is excellent. This place always seems to be busy whenever the time or day, I'm in town. They have pretty good dessert and their black iced tea is really good. The delicious homemade english muffins are also sold in a bag so you can take them home and enjoy them.   The store is adorable, they have all these really cool tchotchkes. I once found a little lego like puzzle with teeny tiny pieces which when assembled made a 3D violin.  The service isn't super great, I gave it 4 stars mainly because of the food."}
{"text":"This is the most horse crap place I've ever been to.  The employees are very uninviting, food is crap and the service is a complete joke for an airport eatery.  Bottomline. Don't spend your money here and hopefully the manager of the place will be kick out on his/her ass"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews for airport eateries but this place is Good! I was really hungry after a disastrous eating experience in ABQ so I headed straight for La Grande Orange when I got off my Southwest flight.  I ordered pizza and was really surprised how great their crust and toppings are! The Mother Earth has olives, artichokes, roasted peppers, broccolini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fennel, onion, and cheese AND IT'S DELICIOUS! It's made to order so expect to wait about 7-10 minutes but it's so worth it and some of the best pizza I've had (airport or otherwise)."}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast with my wife after hearing great things.  The process to order was a bit confusing, but once we connected with one of the cashiers, we figured it all out.  It was a bit of a free for all in the dining room, but we were able to find a seat pretty quickly on a Sunday morning (10:30amish).    The food was incredible...seriously.  I ordered the Commuter Sandwich (egg, bacon, tomato on a fresh-baked English Muffin)...it was fresh and it the spot.  My wife ordered the chicken sandwich...very similar experience.    Ordered a specialty latte as well...very sweet but tasty.    Trendy place, the music was loud, but we enjoyed ourselves and got out of there in under 45 minutes...even though we took our time.    I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to grab a bite in terminal 4.  Great breakfast, lunch or dinner options.  Healthy, fresh and tasty.  I always grab a honey latte and a breakfast burrito as I board my flight...never disappoints.  The commuter sandwich is crazy good, eggs are cooked perfectly.  The airport versions are typically not nearly as good as the original restaurants, but La Grande Orange has done an admirable job when it comes to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I used to live across from LGO in Arcadia and went daily (literally).  I am as so excited to land at terminal D to stop!  What a disappointment. We got the cheese pizza.  Although it seemed busy, I'm sure this was sitting out all day (after being overlooked and rock hard on top). $14 for a terrible pizza?!  Any frozen pizza or sabaro beats this any day.  This is NOT LGO.  Overpriced and terrible. Skip it and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"While shopping around Scottsdale Fashion Square I asked a kind woman helping me where I should go to get some work done. Without hesitation she told me to come here. After, I saw some of my friends had glowing reviews for this spot, I adventured my way over.  Parking was a struggle (but hey, when isn't it for me in a rental car?) but it was well worth it. You know those moments when you walk into a place so cool and eclectic you just have to walk around and find your bearings before you can sit? That's what my wide-eyed happy self did when I walked through the front door.   There are a few patio spots, but I nestled right in a cozy two person table by the front door to hammer out some work. I went to the front to order a drink and felt like I met some new friends. Everyone was kind and so helpful which gave me a lovely home-ee feeling. I went to the wall cooler and grabbed a beer and needless to say, my productivity soared.   I kept smelling intriguing pizza so I had to grab a couple to-go when I left. And... some cupcakes. I got a cheese  and roasted corn with goat cheese pizza and they tasted as good as they smelled. It wasn't a greasy pizza and it had just the right amount of flavor to make each bite beautiful. Been to CPK? The pizzas are about that size. Want to be completely stuffed? Order one for yourself or have a great meal for two. The S'more cupcake was out of this world bursting with goodness. Not too sweet, not too cakey, but jjjuuussssstttt right."}
{"text":"I would love this place alot more if i could ever figure out where to order or where to pick up my food.  Super disorganize layout.  The food is average for the aiport, but decent coffee.  Its definitely a better than the  taco joint next door.  However, your best bet at sky harbor is to eat on the main concourse in terminal 4.  Once you get past security the selection of food drastically narrows."}
{"text":"Wow! I am hooked my friend took me there for brunch and I had the tastiest most fresh omelette ever! And I'm a picky eater! Also had their freshly squeezed orange juice... My goodness I was in awe at how delicious the food was This is my new spot! Will be eating there A LOT!  Only negatives are that parking is a real pain and how busy the store gets which is understandable because everyone wants a piece of it!"}
{"text":"Parking is really tight. If you order ahead you can pick up curbside, and they have spots right out front.   Yesterday I ran in to grab one of my favorites on their menu the heirloom brown rice bowl. It's very flavorful when you add the harissa. Just add it a little at a time because it's spicy.   I like parking and going into the store because they have lots of cute stuff. I did buy a flower bouquet  that I wasn't happy with it at all! I wish I would've unwrapped it a bit before purchasing it for $25 it was not worth what I got, and won't do that again!"}
{"text":"Horrible baked/grilled wings. I like my chicken wings to be crispy and the fat rendered out. I hate soft rubbery chicken skin. It's the worst. But the sauce/flavor was good. Now they still get 4 stars because I won't let one crappy menu item ruin the entire experience. Their salads and pizza were super bomb!  I love the grocery side. They also satisfy my snobby water tastes as well."}
{"text":"So appalling!  It was a beautiful night and we have been here several times for ice cream at this hour!  Tried to pull up in the To Go lane and an arrogant man and his partner would not move. They then went in and got some worker who rudely told us to move our car!  The worst part was that there were cars in every other single to - go - spot but ours!  I WILL never go back there!  The arrogance of the people patronizing this establishment made me realize they are not worth $$!  Ended up at Creamistry!  Lots of parking and the ice cream was made to order!  AND it was fabulous!  Not to mention everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Order a pizza or a kale salad with salmon. Actual order anything here and you'll be a happy camper. This is a must stop food option in the D Terminal at Sky Harbor. If you're a local Phoenician and have never been to their restaurant in the Phoenix area...it's also very cool.   Traveller Tip: The airport ordering feels a little crazy at times when they're busy. The flow isn't quite clear unless they have an employee handing out menus. Pizzas take 15ish & are enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, a coffee, or lunch.  Nice atmosphere, good place for meeting people or hanging out.  On a negative side, parking can be a hassle (unless if you are picking up a togo order-they have several spots right in front for that)."}
{"text":"Been here many times. So many delicious things. The pizzas are delicious. The breakfast sandwich is amazing. They have the best English muffins I have ever had and we often buy some for home. The chocolate chip cookies are some of my favorite ever. It's fun to wander around the store and look at trinkets while waiting for your food, and I often wind up buying some cute little thing.  I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. There are a few great people that work there, but far too often I feel like whoever is at the register is just not really interested in working."}
{"text":"Not in the least bit impressed. Dozens of employees moving at a snail's pace behind the counter but nary a customer being helped or served. Had trouble making eye contact, get greeted of have one of the staff take my order even thought I was standing right in front of the register under the order sign. Employees seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves. The apparent manager was complaining to another employee about a previous customer. Decorum & professionalism, please! That's just bad form. Waited 5 minutes for the blandest, crappiest & most expensive egg sandwich I've ever had. I guess when you have a captive market, brand standards, customer service and quality don't matter. Bad move LGO PHX Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Its very cute and they have a nice selection of stuff. (Food and non-food items.)  I love that everything is fresh and the breads/pastries etc are all made on site.   Had the yogurt with fruit and granola. Yummers!!  Also had a muffin of some sort... I think it was like blueberry white chocolate. Super yummy!  Note: The place isnt all that big and its crammed with stuff. It can get really busy and very crowded with people inside.   Parking is also a bit of a pain...  But its all worth it. Go here!!"}
{"text":"LGO= perfect.   Their gladiator pizza is amazing. The sausage on it is tasty!   The burgers are big and juicy and they have the best ranch EVER! It's homemade!   Their Ruben sandwich is sooooooo good!   Last but not least, they have dessert! They have baked goods and gelato!  It's no wonder why this place is packed EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"After the initial shit show as you walk in to order, the food is fantastic.  Very good stuff. I had the fried eggs and they were very very good. The food was extremely fresh and the employees were very helpful.  Some how need to work the line/order/pick up process and it will be a 5.  Tough to find a seat, but that is expected the place is always crowded."}
{"text":"What a treat to find a delicious and healthy place to eat in an airport. First time eating lunch here .... And it did not disappoint.  The chopped Thai salad is delish!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only tried their bakery items. The cookies and brownies are so yummy. I'll come from Mesa anytime for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"It all started when I was at the new Sinclair Gas Station on the NW corner of 40th and Camelback that I knew I had to write this review. It was a Saturday morning and I was driving on fumes and had to stop for gas. While sitting there, a stranger approached me with an \"Excuse me, can you tell me where I might find a decent breakfast place?\" I looked at him and said \"Welcome to Phoenix, today is your lucky day and you're in the perfect spot.\"  We are on the corner of all corners - and it's Saturday - which means abundant options! So, I go through my favorite three options: Vincent's Farmer's Market, LGO and Over Easy.  I gave him a brief description of each and when it came time to give my rant about LGO, it went a little something like this....  \"La Grande Orange! Oh my gosh, you'll never see anything like it...Look for all the cars and the full staff of parking attendants. Look for the line going out the door. Even more fun, go through the back door and say hi to the kitchen staff (very Durant-ish).  Have the French Pancakes, The Commuter Sandwich, a croissant, or an English Muffin. Go look for great cheeses, fig spread, or affordable, small production wine options, buy your next birthday card or something you don't need there. Look at all the cute families, dogs and have a double cappuccino.\"  He looked at me realizing that I've probably already had one too many double-capps that day and as I said goodbye, and we both pulled out of the gas station, I couldn't help but wonder which of the options he and his family would choose. The parking attendant gave them the spot underneath the 19-minute sign out front..."}
{"text":"First time coming here to meet up with some friends for lunch. Reminds me of Luci's in uptown Phoenix but much more food and beverage options. The open faced chicken salad sandwich was delicious. Actual rotisserie chicken pieces in it with apples. Line was long to order but didn't wait more than 5-10 minutes. Food came out even quicker. Coffee bar, wine and beer bar too. Lots of dessert choices. Cool little grocery shop with tons of hipster stuff/gifts and wine to purchase. Prices are reasonable too. Cool place."}
{"text":"I've been to La Grande Orange (or LGO as Gabi seems to refer to it) more times than any other business in Phoenix! I even ate here twice yesterday and have to admit I'm thinking about going back before I leave town today!  I've learned that La Grande does more than make a mean sandwich- they also have some of the best yogurt/granola I've ever had and have decent sushi for being a grocery (I recommend the spicy tuna).  But my favorite part of LGO- the curbside checkout! We called to place our order, pulled up, and a lovely gentleman brought the food to our car.  Now, that's good service! I need that in Chicago to get me thru the winter!!"}
{"text":"Food looked tasty, especially the pizza, but I ended up having the burger. It was tasty. The beef really good. I give it a four because I would have preferred a fountain drinks versus bottled and not enough seating available. However I do recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this gourmet grocery store and bistro.  We had the croque madam  which was toasted multigrain bread, melted gruyere, tomato, mustard w/an over easy egg on top.  yummy!  After reading other reviews, I decided to try the blackberry bran muffin.  I would never order a bran muffin - EVER!  This was by far the best muffin I have ever had.  It was super moist and flavorful - it didn't even taste like bran.  The lattes are good as well.  We also bought the homemade english muffins that are huge!  We haven't tried them yet but the other reviews were very positive."}
{"text":"LGO is one of my favorite airport food spots with a plethora of grab-and-go options. The kale salad is a definite winner and it's reasonably priced for airport food. The quinoa in it makes it a tad heartier than your typical meatless salad, and the kale is julienned so it's easy to eat. Their champagne vinaigrette is amazing with the parmigiano reggiano cheese and the salad pops with the addition of a handful of red grapes. If you're ever at PHX, it's worth the detour if you have a bit of extra time to spare!"}
{"text":"Kale and quinoa salad. Whoa. Dark leafy greens in an airport?!   This was my favorite airport meal ever, and one of the best salads I've had out in awhile. The produce is fresh; the dressing is bright and flavorful, and the quinoa is perfectly cooked. Yes!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like LGO. I go here very often as I have my monthly RD meetings here. I have only been for breakfast/lunch and would like to go to the pizzeria at night. I love the ambiance of this place. It's so cute and trendy and warm. Everything I have ate there so far has been amazing. The roasted chicken is soooooooo good. Things you have to get there- the english muffins and the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. I don't even like english muffins and LGO's are unbelievable. Don't even get me started on the cookie. I have to get it everytime I go. It is the BEST chocolate chip cookie in the world- and I've had many a chocolate chip cookie in my day. Make sure you specifically ask for the LGO sea salt cookie. One time one of my friends got the \"healthy\" Tammy cookie on accident and from what she said it was not good."}
{"text":"I second the Spanish latte, best coffee drink I've had so far - it's sweetened with condensed milk.  What I like about this place is that it has the feel of a bigger-than-phoenix downtwon coffee bar, even though this place isn't downtown.  Browsing the shop is a good way to pass time while you drink your coffee.  The pizza next door is great (as good as Bianco I think) and the service is excellent (much better than Bianco)."}
{"text":"Pizza, gelato, tasty deli fixin's, wine, gift baskets...  I could easily and very contently live off of this little \"grocery\". There is so much to offer! I ordered the Stacked Turkey on nine grain and it came with a little side of fresh fruit. Bliss! The avocado was so fa-resh-- I felt like I was in Cali. I also snuck a bite of my friend's Tuna Salad and savored the tuna/tomato/apple/cucumber dance party in muh mouth.  The parking in the teeny lot was a bit obnoxious. Regardless, I'd kill to have a deli like this in Chicago. Panera just doesn't cut it for me now that I've been spoiled and hold higher standards!"}
{"text":"Ok, so you bake the English Muffins..we get it, but are they really worth 10 bucks for 6 of them? This is the theme of this Arcadia joint. The prices for stuff at dinner are unreasonable. It is at least 14 bucks for a burger on a very limited menu after 5pm. The sandwiches at lunch seem tastier and are better priced, so why not serve them all day, plus you cannot find a parking spot during the day either. They also own the fancy pizza place and some joint across the street as well. I ended up with a $3.25 Gluten free Chocolate chip cookie and it was big and gooey and had a bunch of nuts. Not too bad for a cookie in that category. Break the bank at dinner and watch all the lovely Arcadia types wander into this family friendly domain."}
{"text":"This place cracks me up.  Full of wanna-be Californians :D  Good food, but over priced.  Good tea.  Nice neighborhood.  Parking sucks.  Pretentious vibe / service."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we eat here.  Great for gluten free eaters with a crispy and tasty pizza crust.  House wine is yummy plus reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, everything is super fresh and tasty. I would definitely recommend their salted chocolate brownie if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I come by PHX often and it's nice that Southwest terminal has lots of food options.  Line is always long but service is fast and friendly. I always get great pastries and their honey latte is to die for.   I went in for lunch today, had their tortilla soup which was very fresh and had chunks of chicken and avocado. I also ordered their tuna Ni√ßoise salad which was ok. When it comes to tuna Ni√ßoise I have a very particular idea in my head and this is more Americanized Ni√ßoise salad. The tuna was way too sweet with raisins in it. Big chunks though which was great. Not a big fan but the salad was fresh and the hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked. The dressing was light and just had the right tanginess. Had the tuna been lemon based, it would be perfect.   I'm still a fan and will come by this place whenever I'm in the Terminal D."}
{"text":"With so many reviews, I'll simply say this.... Gladiator Pizza and Orange/Fennel Salad  Lastly.... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back the grilled lemon cake!!!! PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE!!!"}
{"text":"You can find me here every Wednesday morning for breakfast.  I am a fan of their simple breakfast.  Scrambled eggs breakfast (comes with fruit and toast) with a side of bacon.  It's just a basic breakfast, but they do a great job with it.  I may also enjoy the daybreaker, a pastry, or the granola.  My mother is a fan of the french pancakes, and the croque madame.  The staff is very nice early in the morning, and over the past year or so we have gotten to know them well enough that they know what I am going to order.  They even know that my mother likes her latte without a lid because the foam costs 2 dollars (her logic is that milk is free and espresso costs $2, so $2 must be going to the foam).  They recently have changed their methods, and have properly trained their baristas, of making espresso.  It has improved tremendously.  I look forward to my breakfast every Wednesday, and a great way to start my day and enjoy the AZ mornings."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel for yuppies, that basically sums it up. Really horrible environment with random trinkets for sale everywhere....really every possible inch of this place is crammed full of cutesy clutter for sale! The food was fairly good, but nothing ground  breaking.Great place to see a trust funder in a BMW fist fight someone for a parking spot !"}
{"text":"Shockingly delicious airport food - made me happy I was delayed and came over to the D terminal looking for something decent. Had a mushroom and fennel pizza that I wish I'd had time to get again on my way home. The eating area is a nice little oasis in the mess that is PHX."}
{"text":"after two years of going to postino's and thinking every time, 'i have to try this place soon,' i finally lost my or-ange (pronounced \"oar-ahnj\"; i didn't know either until i caught one of their chefs on a morning news show, and i figured she would know) virginity on easter of all days.  on a side note, is it sacriligious to say \"virginity\" and \"easter\" in the same sentence?  i met a friend there at about 10:30 on easter morning, and, always timid about where i can and can't park in this DeMarco mecca, i circled around the back and got a spot close to the post office. despite being at the back of the long stretch that makes up the grocery, dining and gelato shops, i abided by a giant blue and white sign there in the back that tempted me to \"Come In Here!\" complete with an arrow. i pulled open the door and was greeted by busy, sweaty cooks in the kitchen, whom stared back at me. huh. i closed the door and read the sign again, making sure i didn't misread *deliveries* come in here. nope. confused and mildly annoyed and walked around to the main entrance.  the mini cafe/coffee bar patio was full and there were tons of cruisers parked along the sidewalk (no racks or locks, if you're planning on dining inside). seemed to be Wildflower style, as in order at the counter and try to fight for a table. my dining companion was an old pro and pretty much walked me through the whole thing (getting my attention to order when the girl came out to us in line way before we got to the counter [i was busy checking out a sweet vintage cruiser], picking up our food since they don't bring it to you or call out a number when it's ready, i couldn't even find the trash when it was time to bus our table). all in all i was very disoriented, and i blame it all on that sign! mentirosa!  now, on the important stuff, food was pretty good. all egg white omelette with avocado and fresh pico-style salsa was nice and light (not sure what happened to the side of fruit that was suppposed to come with it).  i got a bit of a funny/offended look from my dining companion for comparing the oar-anj to wildflower as far as clientle (which is the only reason i knock a star off). the best explaination i could offer his defensiveness at the time was that it was all the same kind of attitude, save for the upscale-ness of the oar-anj elicited a more \"cool baby\" snob crowd, while WF is more \"suburbia\" snob. basically, you just trade in the SUV soccer-brat taxis for a hummer or lexus or mercedes s class...all of which were lined up in a neat little row out front .  now that i've said all that, none of the above will stop me from returning. i think i would like the place better as a dinner/drinks spot than breakfast. the uber-tans and blonde streaks (sported by both men and women at this joint) were all too much to bear by the light of day. or i'm maybe i'm just still harboring resentment over that damn sign."}
{"text":"Well...  I was told to go to this place by none other than Gabi M., because I am a philistine and I had no idea it existed.  But I didn't go right away.  Which was my loss, because this place is phenomenal.  I finally ended up here somewhat fortuitously because a student of mine suggested it.  Anyway...  I've been doing this phoenix biggest loser thing because my wife says I'm the biggest loser in phoenix, so when Amber W. started up a competition with the same name I figured hell, I can win that.  Turns out it's about weight loss and so that pretty much means I'm screwed on the $25 entry fee.  Well I wasn't until I went here.  My diet was doing very well, thank you, *until* I went to LGO.  As soon as I walked in I was met with a tsunami of poor health choices and didn't know just how to hold it together.  Pumpkin-chocolate chunk muffin? Blackberry bran muffin? (Which I ordered because bran=fiber=healthy, der!) Strawberry muffin? Cream cheese coffee cake?!?! and a million more delightful delicacies which tempted me for forty seconds before I gave in.  Well not really.  Here's how it went down: I held firm and got oatmeal with bananas, strawberries, and raisins.  Spare me the nutritionist's take, I'm confident that was the best I could do.  So I was pretty proud of myself.  But I *did* have to bring home a muffin to my wife because that story about her saying I was a big loser was a lie and she's actually pretty great.  So I paid for the strawberry muffin but at the last minute changed to blackberry bran at an employee's recommendation and GOD DAMN i am glad i did because that is probably the best muffin I ever had.  Note: Since the charming Gabi M. decided to laugh at me for my food choices *all night* at the OYE I will point out that I ate only 3/7 of the muffin.  That's it!  that's like, um, a 57% healthy choice based on my math.  Anyway my student had an english muffin with avocado and smoked salmon that I was looking lustily at so she told me that I *must* have an english muffin.  She bought a pack and gave me two (I'm a good tutor evidently) and so of COURSE I HAD to eat one.  I say that defensively because Gabi laughed at me for the english muffin too.  I'm scarred.  Anyway.... I know this review is dragging because my wife is now watching Lifetime which means that her head is being filled with all sort of anti-man propaganda as I type.  So I'll wrap it up:   Today we went there and I had a croque madame which is a whole grain open face deal with ham and tomato and mustard and a sunny side up egg.  Pretty damn good.  But we also had the strawberry muffin which was a little disappointing: not moist enough and not strawberry-y enough.  So I give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and I don't think I could eat everything I wanted to eat there if I went in for 14 days straight.  I loved it.  And for the acting on Lifetime, one star.  And the writing: \"I love billy, but I love you more.\" \"Really?\" \"Really.\"  Pulitzer prize stuff, that."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange or LGO is where I take each and every one of my out of town visitors.  Why you might ask? The environment is chill, the food presentation and quality is exceptional and the staff is friendly.  I probably should get paid for all the free word of mouth advertising I do for LGO but it's well deserved.  The Commuter Sandwich (sub may for goat cheese) appears in my dreams from time to time -- it's really THAT good.  I also appreciate the eggwhites/turkey :Daybreaker for my health nut days.  I promise you won't be left unhappy after visiting this incredible establishment!"}
{"text":"Please come to downtown Phoenix!!!! This place is consistently fantastic."}
{"text":"Holy moly the Sweet Basil sorbet and the Chocolate Hazelnut cheesecake are incredible! The Sweet Basil sorbet is the perfect marriage of basil and sugar as a frozen delight. It reminded me of absinthe since it's herbal and poured over sugar cubes before it's served. And the Chocolate Cheesecake was very rich and decadent!   We also ordered the Chocolate Walnut Cookie and the Red Velvet Cake but both were not memorable. The Chocolate Walnut cookie was hard on the outside but had a molten chocolate center, maybe it's for some, but not for me, I prefer an overall soft cookie. The Red Velvet did not have the distinct Red Velvet flavor which is usually comprised of cocoa powder, vinegar, and buttermilk. The flavor just tasted like a generic white cake.  The building is wonderful. There's a pizzeria at one end, and at the other is the grocery store which has coffee, gelato, baked goods, among things you can buy for the home.   Outside, they even have marble picnic tables in case you want to eat outside. Lovely set up.  I will be back to try the pizzeria, and to order the Sweet Basil sorbet again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed frequenting La Grande Orange when I lived right up the street. Now that I live further away, I find myself very uninterested in making a special trip for it. It has little to do with the food - although they've gotten my husband's \"well-done poached eggs\" order wrong 9 out of 10 times - and more to do with, well, everything else.   The parking situation is beyond ridiculous. The seating situation is the same. They play groovy tunes, but need to dial back the volume. Great wine selection, but you can't drink it there (unless you're in the pizza side at night, I think).   They used to have more specialty food items in the grocery section and fewer chochkies. I love the chopped turkey salad, but last time I got it - a few months ago - it was missing some key ingredients. I felt cheated, quite frankly.  The best reason to visit is the Tammy Coe baked goods. If you see bread pudding under the counter, buy it immediately and hoard as many as you can - it is heaven in a takeout bucket. That would make me want to make a special trip!"}
{"text":"After writing my first review the customer service management sent a voucher to retry the food. We went for dinner this time. The pizza was actually really good. I think better then pizza bianca.  The service still sucked. When we walked in the girls were all talking. After a few minutes I had to interrupt and ask if we just sit anywhere.  The seats and table were dirty."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are good. Really good. The server said we have a wine special for 5 bucks we ordered it. Then we ordered it again for a second round. OK good deal. Now we all enjoyed the meal no issues at all with that. The bill came 7 bucks each for the 5 buck wine special. I asked about it...I was given a tongue tripping BS answer...ok whatever. Hokey business practices...good food..you decide."}
{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal. We had the Gladiator. Sausage and sauce are spot on. My wife and I were amazed that we just ate a fantastic pizza in an airport!  Alexis rang us up and she was friendly and polite. Great job Alexis!"}
{"text":"Yum! Picked up the commuter sandwich on my way out of the airport and it was the perfect breakfast sandwich after a 2 hour flight. Pretty expensive though at $7 and the 2 bananas coming out to $3.50 or $4.00 but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience at an airport.  I will come back here if I have to fly through Phoenix again!  -Hungry Hungry Pongy"}
{"text":"Get the bakery brownies, go now and don't hesitate, you will not be sorry. They have sea salt and sans salt, I get without because the salt is overpowering. A good brownie is tough to find and LGO has it. Buttery and rich."}
{"text":"Big fan of LGO! Love the food and grocery store. Been here for most everything. Commuter sandwich is my favorite breakfast item and you can go wrong with pizza or rotisserie food here."}
{"text":"Laid back, fun, marketplace atmosphere with great food. The service was friendly and fast. We went early enough so it wasn't too crowded and were able to snatch a good parking spot.   Tried the breakfast sandwich with avacado and bacon as well as the potatoes to share. The portions were generous. Bacon not too oily with a good stuffing to english muffin ratio. I especially appreciated the fact that the eggs were cooked perfectly - still moist and yet not funny in the middle. We will definitely have to return for some of their lunch items!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat when you have time before your flight or to just grab a sandwich (and maybe a cookie) on the go.  We had a layover in Phoenix, so we grabbed some lunch here.  We ordered turkey sandwiches and a sea salt chocolate chip cookie.  The sandwiches were made on a soft high quality bread, a generous stack of sliced turkey breast, and fresh produce.  It was a large sandwich, which kept us full through our following flight.  After the sandwich we shared the cookie, and it was truly the best cookie I ever ate.  It was big and soft, yet it had slightly crispy edges, and was loaded with chocolate chips and sprinkled with sea salt. It had a lovely contrast of sweet and savory, and it was buttery and chocolaty.  This was the first time I had a cookie with sea salt, and I am totally hooked!  If I ever fly through Phoenix again, I will make sure to make at pit stop here!   Also next time I want to try pizzas, as they looked and smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"LGO has been a favorite of mine for years. I enjoyed it much more when you could actually find a parking space and get in and out more easily, but even the best kept secrets eventually become public.  We enjoyed a nice brunch and were able to find a large table inside to enjoy our food n drinks. There was also plenty of parking for bikes which I would suggest if you are nearby since the parking lot is small and always packed. The English muffins are amazing. We also enjoyed the commuter sandwich and an amazing turkey stack.  Cold brew was great as well.  This place is consistently good and always packed. Tip: try their desserts if you have a sweet tooth!   Great service!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb dot com.   If you love Whole Foods then you'll love this mini-version. It's a cafe, coffee shop, pastry shop, and grocer that sells anything from fresh greens and post cards to hot sauces and wine.  Gabi K brought me here for a small pre-flight brunch. We walked directly up to the counter and ordered from the menu. Like what I saw: lots of health-conscious entrees. Everything looked so delish, especially those breakfast plates they were flinging across the counter with egg whites so artfully laid out alongside fresh fruit and multi-grain toast.   After placing our order, we snagged a very small table near the bottled wine. There I spot various jams; particularly the mimosa jam caught my eye, made with oranges and Champagne. I bought that for a future birthday brunch we're planning at the lake, along with some peanut butter dog treats for my little schmoopie.   When our food finally came out, just minutes later, my seared ahi tuna sandwich (new to the menu) with avocado, greens and tangy sauce was soon just an empty plate with a few bread crumbs and a watermelon slice. It was a large serving stuffed with so many fresh goods, but even more delectable I devoured it before I could even ask Miss Gabi how she was enjoying her Commuter breakfast taco. Also a popular item.  Love the vibe here, It's lively, friendly, local and smells fabulous with that coffee/cafe aroma. And they have free wi-fi too. Wouldn't mind sitting around for a few hours and get some work done. Til next time La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"Order a freshly made, plated salad at the register to save a few bucks for the exact same thing served at the restaurant next door. The girl at the register today was giving me difficulty, saying I need to just grab pre-packaged ones in the fridge. I've been here many times and never had problems before. I stood my ground and eventually received my nicely plated salad :). Smoked salmon salad is my favorite menu item. The tuna ni√ßoise was also very good. You can pick up a nice bottle of wine and eat on the side picnic tables. I forget her name but, on a previous visit, there's a wonderful woman who helped us choose vino and brought us some wine glasses to drink outside. The occasional guests here are of the snooty variety and need to have their privilege checked. But they make for GREAT people watching and it's one of the reasons why my friends and I will linger around after a meal."}
{"text":"A quickie version of one of my favorite restaurants. Smoked salmon salad is still the way to go if you have the discipline of avoiding their carb-loaded goodies: pizza, pastries, gelato, etc. etc.  I hung around for some beers before a delayed flight. I'd avoid the red wine though; it was corky and pretty terrible. Small disappointment in an otherwise great airport option."}
{"text":"Fresh, local food.  Great little spot with assorted creative trinkets.  Little pricey.  Enjoyed the pumpkin spice latte and the breakfast commuter sandwich.  The egg white omelette was probably better for me healthwise but didn't have as much flavor/hot sauce I wanted (ie compared to commuter)... Can be difficult to stay out of the way of people as a little chaotic with small lanes between displays."}
{"text":"After a wonderful meal over at LGO Pizzeria, my group and I wandered over the grocer that's attached to the restaurant.  I believe I may have actually been floored by just how cool and fun this little grocery shop/bakery/cafe was.  It didn't really matter that it was after 7pm and many of the baked goods were half off, they all just looked absolutely amazing.  Even my non-sweet tooth itched to try those truly seductive red velvet cupcakes or the decadent peanut butter chocolate cake.  Even the cookies looked soft, chewy, and delicious.  (Yeah, this is all coming from someone who can't walk in to most ice cream parlors as they simply smell too sugary.)  The place is charming but very tiny.  Just like the cripplingly small parking lot.  Even so, it's easy to find yourself wandering about in search of some hidden treasure, consumable or not, because you know they're there.  It's just that type of place."}
{"text":"Where does one begin to describe the love I have for LGO?  Things I love: 1. Music. Music sets the scene, it determines the vibe. LGO does a great job at picking the perfect music. I'm such a fan of the jazz on Saturday mornings and then Gramatik for that mid morning groove. 2. Trendy. All their employees dress so cute and trendy. Legit I had a nightmare I got a job at LGO and then got fired because I didn't dress trendy enough ( thank god it was just a dream). 3. PASTRIES. Let's get real their baked goods is the real reason I go to LGO. That brown paper bag filled with a sweet treat is more exhilarating than getting a little turquoise box.  My ultimate favorites: hazelnut chocolate cake, sea salt chocolate chip cookie & cheesecake.  4. The Zuni burrito. My God does that burrito make each taste bud smile. I've tried everything on the breakfast menu but I get the Zuni every time.  5. Their salads are bomb.com. Like ALL of them. LGO salads challenge the stereotype that salads are boring. Round of applause for making every single one of your salads taste delish! 6. PIZZA: k guys I know what you're thinking.. how does the list keep going?! Well it does. Pizza is bae. But LGO pizza? I'm drooling. I am a huge fan of the fact that they offer gluten free crusts at no additional cost! My go to is the gladiator. 7. Their hummus is really yummy too guys. 8. Coffee bar- their homemade almond milk is the perf addition to any coffee drink. I usually stick with their iced tea.   This place is perfect for every occasion. I'm probably LGO's biggest fan. I've legit had everything on the menu and not once have I been unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Were it not for the absurd airport prices, La Grande Orange would be five-stars-worthy. I really like everything I have ever gotten there.   This is the first time I have had it in the airport, but I am fairly confident this is as good or better than anything else you could get nearby. Plus it's a Phoenix staple so if you have a layover and can't go into the city, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty hyped heading into our first visit. Unique and cool with some novelty features (annex \"grocery\" store, secluded bar, pizza grille open to the restaurant).   Located in the trendy Arcadia area, definitely noticed a trendy crowd. But the restaurant doesn't try too hard. There's a nice ambience (a bit loud) and a solid vibe.   The menus are lackluster so if you're looking for variety, look elsewhere. Courteous staff, especially the bartendtress tonight who didn't penalize me for ordering the wrong wine!"}
{"text":"I read about this place on a blog coincidentally right before I went to Phoenix to visit friends, so I suggested it to them and we hit it up for lunch one day!  The store itself is super cute. Lots of awesome stuff to gape at while you're waiting for your food.   The food- delicious! I had the Shredded Kale Salad & Quinoa. I was looking for a light, healthy lunch and this fit the bill. I also had some super delicious iced green tea.   We ate outside at a picnic table. Parking was tough, though. We parked in the neighborhood a block and a half away. There's not much else around except this little plaza- it's smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  If you're visiting the Phoenix area, it's worth a visit to La Grande Orange!"}
{"text":"I have been to Postinos a million times, and live just down the road, so I was surprised I had never actually been here. Boy, was I missing out. The pizza is aaaaamazing, the pastry treats are delicious, and the shop is filled with the CUTEST stuff!! They will also do curb-side take-away if you can't go inside (or can't find parking, more likely, if you're trying to run inside really quick and don't want to utilize the valet). Why had nobody told me how amazing this place was? Maybe they were trying to keep it a secret for themselves..."}
{"text":"Early one morning on our way through the lobby of the swanky resort where we were staying, we asked the young concierge if she had a recommendation for a good take out place where we could pick something up to bring back to eat at the end of what was planned to be a long day of exploring Scottsdale. She looked both of us up and down for a moment then said, \"I think you two would get this place. La Grande Orange.\"   We thanked her for the recommendation, then chuckled and asked ourselves \"What did her comment mean, exactly, about \"you two\" and \"getting this\"?\" I guess folks who stay at swanky resorts (this was our first time springing for such a place) eat different food? LOL.   \"Get it\" we did!   We ordered a pizza to go from the adjoining pizzeria and while we waited on it we had a chance to shop for wine, pastries, salads and other take out from this charming little grocery. Parking is a bear during peak times and the lines at the counter are long but it is all worth it.   We're headed back to Scottsdale in a couple of weeks and we'll visit La Grande Orange again, this time for breakfast. And if that same concierge is working at the resort, where we will once again stay, we'll seek out her good advice again. After all, since we're spending a good chunk of our vacation change on great accommodations, take out for meals will be part of the plan!"}
{"text":"Coffee was great, the girl who checked me out wasn't overly friendly but it might be because they were extremely busy. You can never go wrong with a drink, snack or meal at LGO!"}
{"text":"LGO grocery is a great little place, it reminds me of a high class, artsy Cracker Barrel. They have alot of really cute stuff you can't find anywhere else including knick knacks, specialty candies, and accessories. It's also tied into the restaurant and you place your order on the grocery side so it gets pretty crowded, if you head down there try to go during non peak hours, unless you like being packed in like a sardine ^_-"}
{"text":"I love the food here, been coming for at least 10 years. GF pizza, delicious Gelato, Breakfast served until 4pm!!! Can't get better than that!!! Also a market so really fun and different gift ideas and great wine selection"}
{"text":"Ah, LGO you are a Hodge podge of confusion. It's a store, it's a restaurant, it's confusing. I understand of having a store of food based items and then having a dining area in it, like the Queen Creek Olive Mill, is a great example of this, but I don't understand how you can have a restaurant, have a beer cooler, and have kids toys for sale next to beer, ha ha. They have some really cool items for sale but there is no continuity of items for sale, IMO.  My friend and I ordered the classic Margherita pizza. I am a complete pizza snob, so I'm never really convinced on people's opinions of pizza until I actually consume it. All I have to say is that this pizza is pretty solid. Definitely not the best pizza I have ever had, but in no way was it the worst. I would go back here for pizza and not have any difficulty about it. LGO has a really relaxed vibe to it which I find appealing. If I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely come back, but I won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"The La Grand Orange Grocery has an outstanding selection of pastry items which are all delicious.  I also really enjoyed looking through the market items for sale and couldn't help but leave with a few fun items for my home."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place had an excellent pizza and salad bar! I had the \"Mother Earth\" pizza w broccolitini  shrooms. Onions, tomatoes artichokes and more = YUM - fresh oven baked thin crust , just the way I like it!  Also had the shredded kale and quinoa salad and w the house dressing = really good!  This is not solely vegetarian;  You can also get burgers etc , plus your coffees / espressos."}
{"text":"Always Fresh, healthy, upbeat.  Great iced drinks, sandwhiches, etc. Kid friendly, clean, and nice market inside.  Decent vegan menu."}
{"text":"I didn't really get a chance to try out much here.  I walked in during the evening hoping to grab a sandwich and apparently they don't serve sandwiches after 5pm...which I think is strange. Well, I had a cucumber, avocado salad with tomatoes, calamata olives, and feta cheese with a light lemon dressing.  It was SUPER TASTY! Hope to try more next time I visit AZ"}
{"text":"My visit to LGO was great as always!  I love this place!  My biggest issue with this place is that they need to do something about how fast people drive in front of the restaurant.  I was sitting inside and timing cars going by.  They we're going in excess of 50 miles an hour.  One lady was smoking and looking at her laptop.  I really think that LGO should try to go to the state and have a police officer stationed on the road so that they can stop all of this craziness going on while I eat.  At the stop light I surveyed some of the people and I was all like.  Why you going so fast while I'm trying to eat at LGO.  And there all like.... what?... then I was all like.  Yeah I thought so.  Go to LGO its the bomb!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my best airport finds ever! For a moment, I thought I wasn't in an airport. The things I loved:  - variety - lots of different options ranging from ready made salads - think exotic, i got a kale, quinoa, parmesan, grape salad with a lemon vingette drizzle for about $9. huge box, big portion! Also some ready made sandwiches. You can order a more sit down meal as well. They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - price - amazed that I wasn't ripped off. I got a huge salad full of quality products, its not junk for your money. -fast: you can run in there like a mad storm, grab food and hop on your plane.  Overall, wish I flew through phoenix more often so I could eat here!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting, and La Grande Orange was recommended.  We ate 3 meals there in a 24 hour period:  breakfast, dinner (pizza), and breakfast again.  Cleaning and inviting spot.  Wonderful, unique details throughout the business.   What a treasure!"}
{"text":"perfect way to start my day ....ANY DAY !  as FRESH as it can get for breakfast,  staff is awesome, !  quick efficient expedited service by Blair , who is always on target !  Freshness is key here.. although packed for breakfast , no matter what day of the week it is, the staff gets it right and with a smile !  FRESH coffee FRESH Juice  FRESH Pastries.... need anything else ?  nope , just another visit to Le Grande Orange !"}
{"text":"A bit of madness on a Saturday... but it's a cool place with good food. We ducked out back to get lunch at the Italian place owned by LGO, but picked up an iced coffee and salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out.  Lots of good stuff to buy here."}
{"text":"I came here at 2 pm on Wednesday and there was a line out the door. My first thought was \"doesn't anyone work anymore?\" or do they all work nights like me?  I ordered the stacked turkey sandwich, the line moved pretty quickly and the girl at the counter was friendly. The next problem I encountered was finding a place to eat my sandwich. Here is hint: Remove all the pretentious crap (what they call \"grocery\") and put some more tables in the place. Focus on the food and the customers.  Now to the sandwich. What is the Cardinal Sin in sandwich making? The wrong bread, and yep, they did it. They used thin, flimsy 9 grain bread to hold together a stacked turkey sandwich, and after one bite, it all fell apart. So I was left to eat all the ingredients of the sandwich a la carte like a Thanksgiving meal. That's too bad, because it was obvious everything was great quality, and had they used Italian, French, Ciabatta, etc.,  I would not be giving this a 2 star review.  I may possibly return (am in no hurry)  for the treats, or a cappuccino and breakfast. The sandwich experience was too irritating to give another try, especially when a few blocks away The Vig is serving the best damn sandwiches in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just like the 40th street location....the good and the bad.  The process is high maintenance to get good food with fresh ingredients, but how much hassle does a veggie wrap or sundried tomato salad really require?  Not worth it.  The food is good but a pain to acquire."}
{"text":"Affectionately known by neighborhood entrepreneurs as Conference Room A, for its popularity as a place to come with the laptop for a social change of scenery from the dining room table.  Because it's right around the corner, I know I will always bump into someone I know.  I do relate to the comments of some of the other reviewers as I have witnessed some of that pretentiousness.  But when I come I mostly come to work and eat and thus block that out.  And hopefully diversify the audience a bit for the other patrons.  Foodwise, everything is great!  I especially love their Arnold Palmers on a hot afternoon.  For breakfast I'd have to pick the Venice Burrito.  Music can be a little bit loud but if the weather's nice just sit outside at the picnic tables and enjoy the ambience."}
{"text":"I had the best cookie ever. Peanut Butter Butterscotch! OMG. I wish I could order them online!"}
{"text":"An extremely busy airport restaurant, but for good reason!  It has the LGO quality that we all crave, with fresh, local ingredients. It is truly a taste of home away from home, which makes traveling seem less sterile and dull. At breakfast, I recommend the commuter sandwich, it is easy to eat while you are sitting and waiting at the gate, and the english muffins are amazingly good. LGO is revolutionizing the airport food industry, and giving the Phoenix airport a good rap in the process. Take note, other airports! Real food is possible!"}
{"text":"Quick plane change at Phoenix and the closest food spot near Southwest was La Grande Orange. I didn't eat that morning so I was pretty hungry but I didn't want something terribly unhealthy because my friend and I had a big night out later that evening.  There were so many choices here... do I get a sandwich? A wrap? Sushi? Pizza? Pastries (which looks super delicious?!?) Then I saw the \"Zuni burrito\" which pretty much looked like a healthy breakfast burrito.  WOW! This was the best healthy breakfast burrito I ever had in my life! It had potatoes, tofu, greens, and great seasoning. I was pleasantly surprised with each bite. WOW!  What a great highlight in my many stops in the Phoenix airport! Haha."}
{"text":"Met the group for a long run on the canal, then enjoyed a refreshing lemonade and a commuter sandwich with smoked salmon. I love this place. I wish I had one near my house. I would eat lunch here every day and order something different off the menu each time."}
{"text":"The iced coffee on tap is unreal. Please do yourself a favor and get some..."}
{"text":"LGO is a great little brunch/lunch spot and they are pet friendly on their patio, which I and my Sparkle love! :-)  I would like to start with the food, after all, that is what Yelp is actually for, right? LGO has great salads and sandwiches and I like their friday night free wine tastings. My favorite salad is the kale salad (however I have noticed the amount of actual kale over the last several months has gotten smaller) but very fresh, delicious and nutritious. Their Ruben is really good too! :-) Also, if your in for a sweet treat, their sugar cookies are fabulosity, really, just take my word for it! On to the actual ambiance and um, I guess you can call it customer service. Very hipster/ California vibe (which is to be expected since the original started in CA). As for the people that work there... I must say if you are going somewhere to get stellar service or to get a warm hearted hello or welcome, or really even be treated like a human, 95% chance that will NOT happen at LGO. I go there a lot and have a lot of friends that do and we all agree on one thing thing, great food but nasty, mean, bitchy employees that treat you as though you are an inconvenience for even being there. I have actually turned around and left before, and have avoided going there because I didn't feel like being treated as a 12th class citizen. If they could fix that issue, it would make the whole experience much more enjoyable. But hey,  you can always call ahead and get it to go. All in all though, good place :-)"}
{"text":"Well, I have to admit, i'm a regular here. But most of the time it is a quick grab and go situation. This time, my boyfriend and I decided to have full blown breakfast and boy, it was amazing!!! I got the Daybreaker omelet {Egg whites, roasted turkey breast and tomato/avocado salsa} ...Healthy and really just perfection. What wasn't so healthy were the side of roasted potato yanks, but OMG they were TO DIE FOR. I have been craving them every day since. I'm also a BIG fan of their iced tea. I love you LGO & will most definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast, lunch, or dinner spot. Also, my favorite stop for last minute gifts. I can't express my love of the relaxed atmosphere, amazing food, and adorable merch at this hot spot. La Grande is also home to the best honey latte I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I love that its tucked away in Arcadia. I love that they have every possible little knick-knack your heart could desire. The grocery/novelty section is dangerous for my wallet. I absolutely LOVE the big mural of the lemon kissing the orange. I have been here to eat several times, and we always get the gladiator pizza, which is a little greasy but delicious! And one last thing....the LGO english muffins. GET THEM."}
{"text":"I just want everyone to know that I am nearing the end of a 3 week business trip abroad, muscling my way through the stint in India, and all I can think about is how I'm going to eat a commuter sandwich when I get home.   Is this wrong? Do I need help? Maybe. Or maybe it is that good ...   LGO, making people salivate all over the world. I'm coming home soon, my little English muffin!!!  (Ok, yes, I do need help. And a gym.)"}
{"text":"Well, I tried to get my LGO fix before I left Phoenix. I made the mistake of thinking the airport version was the same as the flagship location in Arcadia. I have been to the flagship store over 100 times, and the food quality is always consistent & excellent. Their pizza is amazing yes, but so is their green chile burger. It's a generous beef patty made with never-frozen grass-fed beef. Now for the airport version of the green-chile burger that doesn't belong in the same universe: the beef patty was not the same weight, it was a thin, dry McDonald's quality patty. It lacked flavor and was just old & tired. Also I asked for it to be cooked medium & it was well-done. I don't think the English muffin was from LGO. There was no Russian dressing. The green chiles were soggy & disgusting to the point I took them off. I didn't have time to bring it back since I had to board a plane. If you are looking for a top-notch restaurant in Phoenix give LGO in Arcadia a try. Skip the airport location which is bringing down their brand that they have been trying to establish for many years."}
{"text":"Love love love this spot! Oh how I wish there was one much closer to me. They're a one-stop shop for cute, quaint, quirky gifts, a sweet treat and a drink."}
{"text":"I had a personal pizza, pepperoni. In terms of my experience with this pizza only, I thought the pics was not tasty at all, compared with little Cesar or cpk. Just salty and oily. The cook cut the pizza apparently doesn't really care that he is in an airport with travelers as the main customer base. The pizzas are cut very carelessly, and some like mine has one cut on the very edge and another one at the other edge not even close to the middle, and if course the cuts barely cut through the cheese and not the dough. For $15 even at an airport it was overpriced."}
{"text":"I love this place! My second visit here while visiting family. Their food is so fresh and healthy for the most part. I've had breakfast and lunch and looking forward to going again soon.I had the chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the Thai Chicken Salad and we shared. I loved both but would try something new on my next visit. The desserts look amazing..but I am trying to be good, so maybe next time. They have something that looks like a Hostess Cupcake..looking forward to trying that. I would recommend to anyone In the area..plenty of seating inside and out as well..and valet parking."}
{"text":"I ordered the guacamole BLT in between my flights and it was delicious! Of course, I was starving so maybe I'm a little biased but it hit the spot. It was pricey for what it was, but that is to be expected for airport food. The service with quick and friendly. If I'm ever back in the Phoenix airport flying Southwest and need a meal, I'll come back."}
{"text":"Great place.... comsmopolitan combined with quaint. LOVE the pizza & red velvet! Not together. So good it gets crowded..... only downfall."}
{"text":"It's nice to swing by grab a $2 beer and sit on the patio, and chat with friends while all the pretty Arcadian locals come in to grab their superior breads and cakes.  I would expect a beer at a place like this to cost $5.  Nope.  It is only $2, while my own pretty little wife with her affluent proclivities finds, thinks, postulates and debates which bread will best suit our upcoming party.  I can sit back and have a reasonable drink for only $2 at a truly pleasant setting."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best pizza I've ever had the crust is amazing. The store had so many cute little things I wanted to buy it all. Definitely recommend getting gelato after as well. my server Gina was super helpful and friendly too!"}
{"text":"The fresh MJ breads and Tammie Coe cakes/pastries are the best on the west coast.  The communter sandwich is my favorite breakfast food.  The to go salads are fresh and more than you can eat. It is a very popular place, so be prepared to wait in line, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the amount of of choices ! There are a lot of sandwiches (hot and cold), burgers, soups salads, pizza and other things.   I ordered a cheeseburger with pickles and fries. It took about 10 minutes to make, which really wasn't too bad. The burger was $13, so a little pricey but what else do you expect from an airport... However, it was tasty. The meat was extremely juicy, but the bottom bun was soggy mid way through. French fries were ok, not my favorite. Their ranch was not the business. My coworker got the margarita pizza and said it was really good.  The soups an salads looked good.   The person working the cash register was a sweetie and very attentive to all of the customers. :)"}
{"text":"My visiting daughter from Montana took us here following a hike up Echo Canyon at Camelback Mtn. We were completely impressed. Had the cubano panini and it was delicious!  Very hipster location with a nostalgic candy section, interesting books ala Urban Outfitters, and wonderful freshly squeezed lemonade. We'll definitely be back! Great value and incredible food."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Complimentary valet parking. Whoot!! Came here for an early date night dinner and ordered some of their baked wings for an appetizer.. I don't like BBQ and these wings had some homemade BBQ sauce with some hot sauce. Which I clearly didn't see in the menu. So when they arrived I could literally smell the BBQ on them so I asked the waitress and she told me it was mixed in I told her I don't eat BBQ and she kindly took them back and brought some hot baked wings instead. The wings were good but in some areas they were burnt and i didn't like that taste but my BF did. Lol the wings also didn't have much sauce but the waitress brought us extra without asking. Score!  Our pizza... Was delicious! It's a must try. The crust is just right ugh mouthwatering. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"We always love this place - the food is consistently great (my favorite is breakfast here - Croque Madame sandwich is awesome), the people are all pretty and fun to watch, and the merchandise is interesting and ever changing.   I will say that that ordering and finding a place to sit are sometimes a cluster and who needs the extra stress around breakfast-time?  Because of the popularity, this place is sometimes slammed...a good problem to have probably.  (Don't get me started on the parking situation...).  Overall though, it is always worth the effort."}
{"text":"This place had tons of on the go options! I bought a pre made turkey sandwich and it was super yummy. They also have tables with plugs which is nice! Friendly staff and great airport food!"}
{"text":"Excellent Margarita pizza! We look forward to it when in Phoenix airport. Try it; you'll like it!"}
{"text":"My favorite item is the blackberry bran muffin, it's Amazing. Weekends it can be fierce, parking, waiting in line, and then on top of that seating is like musical chairs. But other then that it's definately worth it. Wish I lived closer because i would be there everyday."}
{"text":"i am begining to think they don't sell anything short of amazing.  french pancakes- stellar turkey stacked sandwhich- stellar choco pudding- beyond stellar  they even have curb side which i love when i swing by during my lunch break.    i just love this place!"}
{"text":"So as you don't miss your next layover, I'll keep it quick and concise:  Fries that come with the burgers are actually pretty good. Burgers are small as heck for $13something, but hey, i t s a i r p o r t f o o d. Price aside, I ordered my BBQ Bacon burger cooked medium, and I think they did a pretty good job getting it right. I have no clue if I'll ever rate an airport restaurant 5 stars, but I think this one is above average. Pretty good."}
{"text":"So.... I have been here many, many times and agree that peak hours might not be the time to come if you are in a hurry or don't want to stalk someone to find a table, but it is the perfect place to come if you come during off hours or want to people watch.  I would have to say that the French Pancakes w/fruit and creme fraiche and organic coffee are my staple.  My main complaint was by the time I pick up my food and get settled at my table, they were cold or warm at best.    My bf came in from North Carolina for a visit and she wanted to revisit her fave bfast spot so we made it up to LGO around 9:30 on a Monday.  To my pleasant surprise they had changed their plasti-ware/plate service to the real thing!  Oh... how I love an unexpected surprise especially of the non-plastic nature.  We ordered French Pancakes, Croque Madame, Pumpkin/choco muffin, Almond croissant and coffee.  All yummy and perfectly hot for our dining pleasure.    As always, browsing through their supply of fun and funky stuff in the \"maybe I can't live without this trinket\" section leaves you wanting to buy that special something for yourself.  I wonder if I can ever get past this evil LGO marketing technique.  So.... come in and enjoy during off hours and miss the table stalking and parking nightmare.  It is definitely a good value and good food."}
{"text":"This is a solid place.  We have come here for lunch, dinner and today for breakfast.  I love their english muffins, they are so different, maybe because they are grilled cooked.  Their pizzas are very good, as well as their salads.  I had the I love Brooklyn english muffin with smoked salmon, onion, tomato and scrambled egg.  It was huge.  I also had the monkey bread muffin, so decadent.  Their cookies as spectacular, specially the one with the chocolate chips and sea salt.  I love walking around the store and looking at the stuff they have for sale.  Today I bought a funky pair of socks for my little girl.  Great place!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix.  I return regularly  definitely not Denny's'. The Eggs Benedict are like none other"}
{"text":"Its 4:30am and I am at the airport reconsidering many life decisions (primarily why am I  at the airport at 4:30am?). As  enter the D gate I see Petes' coffee setting up and in a distance a large orange sign. I look at Petes, I look at LGO. I do that for about 5 mins (because I'm not a decisive person at 4:30am) and head on to LGO to try their stuff.  My mind is very temped to buy the Havana Latte (A latte with sweetened Condensed Milk in lieu of plane-jane-milk) but my thighs and the few few miles I ran yesterday told me to get my shit together. Okay. Regular Latte it is. BUT I'M GETTING A CROISSANT. Because I'm worth it, damnit!! Or something about being awake longer hours and burning more calories. I'm not quite sure, my logic also fails me at this hour of the day.  Since they didn't have the pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissant), I got a regular one and they heated it up and stuffed it with jelly for me. The jelly was abundant and my poor-man's-sandwich tasted decent. My coffee was also good, despite lacking the delicious sweetened condensed milk that I used to drink out-of-the-can in my younger years.  Who knew, the airports' getting faaaaancy,"}
{"text":"Would have given 3.5 stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do a 4-star review on this place.  I've been getting takeout from here for a few years and at first would rate them a 5* for service, quality and food. Now, they've dropped in all those categories.   Used to be, you would call in your order and they would make it for you on the spot. It would be ready for pickup within 10-15 minutes or so, and their special parking for curbside pickup was super convenient. Food was fresh and delicious (my fave is the Evil Princess Thai Salad).   NOW it's certainly not the experience it used to be. Here's what happened today when I ordered lunch - what has happened every time I've ordered in the past 6-9 months or so....  I call in my order (EPT Salad with extra peanuts) and the girl on the phone says \"We don't have any salads made yet.\" Ummmm... so, why not just go ahead and make one? BECAUSE they don't do made-to-order salads anymore. I am asked to wait 30 minutes because by that time all the EPT salads will be done. Even though this is an inconvenience (and pretty ridiculous really) I am willing to wait. She confirms my order and I remind her... extra peanuts please.  (Oh and BTW my associate's Pizzeria Chop Salad is ready anytime- so is that from yesterday then?)  And despite requesting extra peanuts from all three people at LGO I've dealt with today (including the girl bringing out my order) - no extra peanuts. *sigh*  My coworkers and I used to order from them weekly. So now instead every 4-5 months i hope to give them another chance but am just disappointed every time.   PS - they no longer carry Tammy Coe cupcakes (which are heavenly), even though the bakery is literally 3 doors down from them. They have subbed them with their own (again mediocre) baked items."}
{"text":"Snagging a meal before a flight can often be a pain, because the food is often overpriced, low-quality or both. Luckily, La Grande Orange offers a variety of pizzas, salads, and sandwiches at (relatively) reasonable prices. I grabbed a kale salad between flights, and it was pretty good! The pizza also looked quite tasty, but takes more time because you have to wait for it to bake.   There is a fair amount of seating, which makes this place a particularly convenient stop if you have a Phoenix layover."}
{"text":"I love their food. However, their service is absolutely terrible. I've been coming here for over a year and I can honestly say that I have NEVER came across a nice employee here. If it weren't for my addiction to their Thai chicken salad, I would not visit this place due to the lack of courtesy the employees show. I've read some other reviews with the same complaint. I suggest maybe getting your employees some training in customer service!!"}
{"text":"great airport food! affordable & good quality - similar to grande orange on 40th st. also, lots of outlets!"}
{"text":"Typically, I'm here about twice a week. I've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I am yet to have been disappointed. It's always popping especially during dinner so I suggest getting there early because they don't take reservations. Breakfast is great. All the salads I've gotten on the menu are tasty and their pizzas are delicious. Mother earth pizza is my favorite. If you haven't gone you should!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how good this was! I'm giving the rare five stars to an airport grab-and-go for quality and value. I had two scrambled eggs, two slices of sourdough toast, a little fruit and a small drip coffee for $9.50. The eggs were surprisingly delicious -¬†not your standard, rubbery, cheap restaurant eggs. The toast was also wonderful, and came with seedless blackberry jam and two pats of butter. I would have liked more fruit, but the slice of cantaloupe I did have was great.   I would have paid more for this, but I'm glad I didn't have to. They told me it would take ten minutes to prep, which would have been totally fine, but it was more like five. Plenty of seating and a well-stocked extras bar nearby helped me get my coffee ready. This is exactly what you need when you come to the airport, it was the perfect fuel for my travel day!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, trying something different each time and I've NEVER been disappointed. My boyfriend and I split a California roll out of the case and it was some of the best sushi we've had. The open-faced Croque Madame is a must try as well!"}
{"text":"I am sitting here now, at La Grande Orange, enjoying myself. Reminiscing, looking at my blog and being in love with their Quinoa/Kale salad which is divinity.   The music was very loud when I came in an hour ago. This I loved, but the ancients  started complaining so they turned it down..   Ive come to expect this in Phoenix.   When will oldies just die already? Just kidding."}
{"text":"Could there be a cuter store?? I mean really, could there be? I think not!   This place is stupendous. It's a foodie's wet dream. It's a brunch-goer's happy place. It's a latte lover's paradise and why, oh why, can't it be in MY hometown. Seriously, I would live here just for the gourmet goodies alone and then add the stellar menu of deelish goodies like croque madammes, fig pizza, creamy yummy oatmeal and a latte with liquid raw sugar! AWESOME.  You have a loyal Los Angeles fan La Grande Orange and I will be back, oh yes, I will! :)"}
{"text":"Or referred to as \"LGO\" for short was where I ate lunch on Thursday. Bringing my laptop as my date, I took advantage of their free Wi-Fi service to create some clever rap review, but hit a road block. NOTHING rhymes with \"orange!\" Sure, I could've came up with something more clever, but I found myself easily distracted with this new tidbit and had to share it! :)  Okay, okay...now back to LGO. I grabbed a fresh smoked salmon chopped salad ($8.25), which had bits of asparagus, sunflower seeds, couscous, tomatoes, craisens, and a side of champagne vinegerette dressing on a bed of romaine lettuce. Not being a fan of the dressing, I was more impressed with the generous amount of fresh smoked salmon, which was delivered at the right temperature mixed with the fun texture of couscous. Adding a bottle of water, it was the perfect and delicate lunch to balance the heavy, 98 degree weather. The portions at LGO don't look large, but they always fill me up. Maybe it has to do with the backdrop of super attractive, earthy, trendy looking people in sunglasses, chic capris, yoga wear, and sandals that keep my appetite in check? Either way, LGO is a great place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner with their casual menu. I'm slowly becoming a fan of their pizza as I'm getting use to the taste of sourdough crust, but love, love, love their array of freshly baked pastries, muffins, cookies, cakes, etc. Many slices of heaven await my eager and grubby hands as I fog up the glass case, while admiring their perfection. The price points are a tad high, but considering they use fresh ingredients and bake in-house, it's quite reasonable. When the weather is cooler, the patio is a great place to seat and catch up with friends. A lot of bikes are usually parked along the brick wall, adding a bit more flair and color to the place. The music is always on point with an eclectic mix of Jay-Z, Kings of Leon, indie pop, or electro-often making me want to bottle pop from their large selections of wine. Not only do they carry an array of vino from the floor to the ceiling, they also have a classic candy isle with modern day pricing, pet and kiddy goods and treats, a coffee bar (not a fan of it personally) and lots of other unique trinkets and gift items to browse through while you wait to order.  Which now brings me to the only 2 things I dislike about LGO: The California-like traffic in their parking lot and grocery store/restaurant/pizzeria/coffee bar and...that nasty coffee. If you come during rush hour, you should expect to fight for a parking spot or be cautious of someone backing out (hopefully, not into you), and those randoms (don't assume they're  all Asian :P) driving the wrong way. If you survive that, you'll be entering into a mess of people browsing up at the menu, with those that are annoyed because they know what they want, with the \"regulars\" who are actually in \"line\" to order, to the people frozen in place looking at the pastries, in-between the \"pick up\" area where people are actually picking up their orders, standing next to those who are still waiting to pick up their order, while getting in the way of the people in line at the coffee bar who just want to order their damn coffee and OJ, and the rest are now just trying to grab their silverware and napkins to eat. Just remember to breath...and breath. Kundalini. Some how, some way, you do end up with a seat somewhere and actually enjoying your meal. Otherwise, come in at an off beat time where the place is yours for the taking :) As for their coffee...have ordered it 3 different times and still hate it. They rank 2nd to Pita Jungle when it comes to the worse coffee I've ever ordered, which is too bad since the open air ambiance would perfectly compliment a great cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the commuter? I didn't give it a 5 because the staff is usually rude (understandable since they are always so busy) and when ordering, you are always in the way! Until you find a seat, the experience is stressful. But, after the first bite into a commuter, you forget all about the overwhelming experience of ordering."}
{"text":"I found this gluten free spot from the phx website skyharbor.com. I ordered a gluten free Mother Earth pizza that was quite delicious! The crust was a little crunchy like flatbread but the cheese and toppings made up for it big time! The food was also prepared professionally and quickly! The pizza person was extremely helpful and friendly. I now know where to get good grub in the airport. And the price was quite alright at $13 for a small gluten free with like 10 toppings!"}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich was very fresh and excellent as was the tropical tea. I appreciated that the fruit side didn't have melons but apples, grapes and pineapple. The best part was great service from Xavier. As a semi-frequent traveler, his friendliness was wonderful. I'll be back! (The 4 instead of 5 was the pre-formed burger patty on my husbands burger)."}
{"text":"After stopping by here several times to buy bread on Sunday, because Pane Bianco is closed, I had the opportunity to have breakfast here several times; amazing food and grocery area. Very glad they have a complimentary valet these days but seating can be chaotic. Love the strawberry brioche, pizza, and daybreaker sammie sans meat!  Buy the reuseable cups for cheap iced tea refills which are necessary in PHX during the hot summers."}
{"text":"Fantastic red velvet cup-cakes. Pricey but worth it. Parking is very limited. Salads were good, but overpriced. Pizzas were good."}
{"text":"oh wow, this place is amazing! It's like a modern Cracker Barrell (no offense, I like Cracker Barrell) however, this place had a younger, more hip twist to it. Pet friendly patio, picnic benches in the back, and complimentary valet. I could get used to this!"}
{"text":"Cold ham on the breakfast sandwich just like a deli sandwich with lunch meat.   Very disappointing. Menu says it comes with avocado yet they are out but still charge you full price?!? Come on... Bread isn't toasted? Is this even a breakfast sandwich? No such thing as light mayo can be ordered.  I wouldn't come here again. Over priced for what you get. BYOS bring your our sandwhich! It's probably better."}
{"text":"Great food - at an airport!! Who knew this was possible? I ordered the chopped turkey salad. It was delicious. Fresh ingredients and a tasty combination of flavors. Just what I needed."}
{"text":"I finally got over to this place and I am so glad that I did.  I took the advice of reviewers and went at an odd hour and we had no problem with parking or with getting a table.  I can't really say anything new about this place except that they sell Orbee dog toys, which I have not been able to find anywhere else in the Valley.  What dog doesn't need a chew toy shaped like an eggplant?  I suppose more people care about food than dog toys, so lets get back to that.  I got some sushi from the refrigerator case and my boyfriend ordered the BLT which was dressed with guacamole instead of the usual mayo.  He loved it.  I will definitely be going back here, even just to get a glass of the iced green tea."}
{"text":"I recently moved and live really close to LGO and I'm feeling really lucky! In the last week I have had the rotisserie chicken sandwich - a stacked turkey sandwich, a croque madame (which, if you dont know what it is, just get it.) and probably the best blueberry muffin I've ever had...oh and gelato, an incredible chocolate chip cookie (sea salt!) and coffee.. I'm guessing I'll find an excuse to get there tomorrow! Also the pizza...WOW!"}
{"text":"My family's favorite breakfast restaurant.  We live in Tempe and still would drive 15-20 mins here for breakfast.  When we came the first time, it was kind of confusing.  Now the weekend rush is just part of the charm.  Great pastry but don't show up too late.  Runs out by 8-9am.  Great coffee and ice tea.  Breakfast entrees are typically very tasty.  Can't go wrong with the Chocolate cookie and cake either.  Pizza for lunch is typically great as well.  We learned to not add any more toppings to standard menu because it can make the food a bit too salty.  Besides La Grande, Pomo is the only other Pizza place we frequent."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm departing from the D gate this is my go to coffee stop. My drink is the Havana Latte and by no meals is it healthy ...BUT...for a guilty pleasure drink that always does the trick you won't be disappointed!   Not the biggest fan of the food but it's all made to order and tastes good...but it's just not my jam."}
{"text":"English muffin for Commuter Sandwich is closer to a Bialy or Roll.   Friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"Always a bit crowded but worth the wait.  I've only gone here for breakfast, but it's always been superb.  The Coffee is outstanding, and the apple oatmeal cookies are worth killing for, should you ever be put in that situation."}
{"text":"I had the bbq bacon cheeseburger and it was quite tasty.  The cookies are huge and delicious!  Try the A-Z cookie for something unique (variety of nuts, chocolate chips and cornflakes).  The sea salt chocolate chip cookie also looked quite good, and they have a few gluten-free cookies too"}
{"text":"SO glad I was able to get food from here instead of my usual muffin & crappy cup of coffee from Starbucks.  It was about 530am & they were extremely busy but very helpful.  I ordered an english muffin, a honey latte & some sea salt chocolate chip cookies to take to my family back home.  My order came out quickly & the english muffin was huge, very fluffy.  The star of the show was the honey latte...mmm. No bitter, burnt taste, just smooth yummy coffee! My family & I loved the chocolate chip cookies! I'm a sucker for anything salted! I will be visiting their other location to try out more of their food. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Today was my first trip to LGO, the place is hyped on Instagram and by Phoenicians in general. I was a little less than impressed. It is very crowded inside when there is a line and you're stuck between the cooler filled with salads and juices, merchandise shelves and the door. And then being called to get your food you have to barge back through people ordering coffee and the other patrons waiting for food. My tuna sandwich was really good. I did enjoy it, however I ordered a side of spinach and there was a beetle in it. I thought it was a folded up spinach leaf but no, green beetle. It's not a huge deal, because fresh produce often has bugs but it was disappointing that LGO doesn't throughly wash and inspect their produce.  Overall, if I go again it'll be at an off hour (probably mid afternoon) and it'll be for take out."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to try something new, but was very disappointed. On Yelp it says Vegetarians love this place. Being a vegetarian, I decided to try something simple like the veggie sandwich. First off, it was basically all just leafy greens with soggy tomato. I also asked for the pineapple salsa that the cashier highly recommended. I got a slice of pineapple, but no salsa? Over all, I believe this place to be highly overrated. Might go back and try desert, but definitely not food."}
{"text":"Kudos to LGO for the neighborhood dynamics. I am pretty loyal to this grocery due to their consistent quality, except... What is changing with the English Muffins? The Commuter Sandwich isn't that awesome flavor without the heavy cornmealed, slightly oily English Muffin. The one this morn tasted more like a roll than a muffin and is unfortunately the 2nd in the last few months that has been below their usual quality. Meh."}
{"text":"As people have stated it's a unique place in a neighbourhood (arcadia) that has a lot of good restaurants. The parking situation is a bit ridiculous but just get into the parking lot and before you know it someone will be leaving and you'll be fine. It's all part of the experience. The food is really good. I love the GF pizza. Best in town. Got a case of food poisoning from it last month and called the manager but have not heard back from them since. Most food poisoning's come from improper hand washing.  Otherwise have always had good service here with great food. You can sit inside. You can bring your dog and sit outside.  It takes a couple of months before you learn all the nuance's of this place but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick salad while waiting for a connecting flight.  Prices are what you'd expect in an airport, but quality was pretty good.  I had some kind of a pizza salad - complete with olives, pepperoni and a light dressing.  Hit the spot."}
{"text":"Really LGO?! I quit going to my neighborhood spot because of all the \"affliction wearing douche's\" that have over run every area of my neighborhood. A friend invited yesterday for lunch,so we jammed on our cruisers..well, you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday. I was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months..months I tell you. I order from a chipper little gal...I asked if I could have it open faced. She didn't think it would be a problem...wrong answer! The kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before..oh yes they have and use to get it right..guess the new peeps from down south didn't get the how to memo.  The 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top...Really?? I took it back..a different girl said what's wrong with that? Apparently everything you nit wit! So, they remade it, check my photo..this is what I got back..except I added the zig zag of color just so I could choke it down. The \"manager type\" person actually handed this to me and said, \"your remake\" Really? But I was so hungry and frustrated, I took it..not even any fruit..so for $7.50 I got a plate of tuna poop. 3 bites later, it hit the trash receptacle. Don't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over..cuz it just ain't happening right. I was here a couple of months ago, ordered potato leek soup, came out curdled and cold..an employee walking by my table said, \"wow that doesn't look right, gross\" wouldn't take it off the bill and was like, \"glad I'm not eating it\". And I'm glad I'm not eating here anymore and that Bertha's and Acacia Cafe have moved into the neighborhood. The people watching may not be the same, but the food is great, service outstanding and even better prices. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.  I really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.  HOWEVER.....  EVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.  Anyway, everything is top notch."}
{"text":"Quick airport food really can't get any better.  Everything is top notch here. Great burger!"}
{"text":"Their orange juice is delicious, but for $16, this is by far, without a doubt, the most mediocre pizza I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Awesomeness! So smart but It's a bit confusing for a fist timer. Them muffins are great wish they put more sandwiches and breakfasts on them. The place is so rules free I hope people do not take advantage because they give the customer the benefit of the doubt.     Pizza was nice, love to have tried the sweets but as it was January I was already way over my careful calorie count. The rockin tunes added so much though I am sure the format appeals to mostly a younger crowd.     Some Details, Counter Service until 4. Pizza day time only weekends. Sandwiches are picked up at a different counter than, pizza and burgers. There is a white bucket for your dishes."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange has a little bit of everything, giving you quality, freshly prepared dishes quickly and at reasonable prices.    It's compact but there are lots of different food stations. You can order breakfast sandwiches at one cashier, pizza at another, salads, sandwiches, cookies, juices and more. They have a modern menu with healthy choice options like Kale and Quinoa salads, Veggie Burgers, Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, along with all your more \"normal\" food items.   Commuter Sandwich (Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Tomato, Mayo, add Avocado on an English Muffin) - I was really impressed with the freshness of my breakfast sandwich. For the main item, I could have had bacon, ham, turkey, smoked salmon or avocado. I went with bacon and they only charged me an extra dollar to add avocado. I would totally order this again.    They have so much stuff to choose from here that everyone in your party should be able to find something to eat for breakfast or lunch. If you are in a hurry, you can pick up food to go quickly here, or you can sit down and eat after you order and pay as it's a fast casual spot. One of the guys working at the airport Starbucks suggested this place to me and I'm glad they did!"}
{"text":"Love that LGO is at the PHX airport - great place to stop in for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  I dropped in yesterday on my way to Orange County and got a mint tea and the 7th heaven muffin - delicious way to kick off an early morning!"}
{"text":"Awese Cuban sandwich with gruyere cheese! Lemonade was really good (ingredients were lemon juice, sugar, water and egg whites) cause it was super sour and yummy! I Would have given this place 5 stars, however I first ordered a honey latte, didn't like it, and they wouldn't let me exchange it. But go figure for airport food, right?"}
{"text":"The commuter sandwich is a great way to start off a Saturday or Sunday morning. I get mine with bacon, havarti, and avocado. It is consistently great. Everyone I go with is a fan of whatever they get. The only thing that I have ordered that I was not a huge fan of was the guacamole BLT. The atmosphere and vibe can't be beat and there is always great people watching.  I recently just tried dinner at LGO for the first time. I have always appreciated their breakfast but now I am a giant fan of their dinner as well. Quite possibly even more so than the breakfast which is saying a lot. I got the avocado pizza with prosciutto. After completely devouring it, I must say it was one of the better things that I have ever tried. We also had the quinoa and kale salad that they split onto two plates for us without asking which was really nice. The salad was very tasty top it off with a bottle of wine and great ambiance. It was a really nice evening."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to find good quality and/or healthy choices at an airport. They offer a wide variety of foods from sandwiches to burgers to pizza. I had the Stacked Turkey Sandwich and I was shocked it was very good and it came with a lot of meat. Included with the sandwich were pickles and fruit. The prices are very reasonable, especially for an airport location. One gripe I have with the place is the order pickup. I can't entirely blame the workers because there are just so many people, both patient and impatient, ordering food. The workers are completely lost on orders and can't keep up calling the order numbers. If you can look past the questionable pickup, I definitely recommend this place if you have time and need food at the PHX airport (located at Terminal 4)."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza and the smoked salmon salad are fantastic. Great vibe. Can be a bit confusing if you go during the day."}
{"text":"Amazing curbside service.  Nice job! Took me three minutes from phone order to order received! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Yummy kale quinoa salad!  Excellent options, friendly service and delicious.  Did not try the pastries as I'm eating gluten free these days, but they looked really good!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is expensive, but if you frequent airports and you want something that tastes good and isn't greasy you will like La Grande Orange. I randomly tried this place a few months ago and I was pleasantly surprised that my English muffin breakfast sandwich wasn't greasy at all. The fresh squeezed orange juice is some of the best that I have had anywhere. I wish there was a place like La Grande Orange in every terminal of every airport. This one is located in Terminal D, I have on multiple occasions made the trip from Terminal C to D and back just to get breakfast here. If there was a way to order online while I was in line for security that would make it even better."}
{"text":"Good healthy choices at this establishment.  Fresh baked goods are offered as well. They have gluten free, non dairy choices. They have a great selection of salads and pizza & burgers. Not your typical airport fare.  Also available are prepackaged food & ready to go if you're in a rush to catch your flight.  A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"So fun, and so crowed. The cactus sugar cookie is delicious! Very good service and quick despite the crowds."}
{"text":"Food is good, great for a quick grab and go too.  However, typical for HMS, service typically sucks.  If these people hate their jobs so much that they can't smile, say hello and thank you, they just need to stay home.   If it weren't for the staffing issues, they would have much a better rating.   The \"real\" location in town is great, if visiting, check it out."}
{"text":"I only love this place for getting together on lazy sundays with my girls! Im NOT crazy about the atmosphere nor counter service.. The breakfast/brunch choices are good..Im always into the poached eggs with proscuitto on english muffin.. we always get coffee and chase it with a bottle of good wine! WHICH, you can buy in the store and they will open / cork it for you.. but NOT serve you...which is fine! Ive had the Sonoma Salad.. Im not into that its in the refrigerator there as 'premade'.. but good for the grab/go.. Im just into 'fresh built'.. :-)"}
{"text":"Love LGO. Trendy, fast and a cute little breakfasty, brunchy joint on the weekends. Love all the coffee selections. The fact that you can even grab a Reisling from the refrigerator and hang out at the table and share! Tammie Coe cakes is also the baker of little fattening delicacies for the person you may have left home! Pizzas are yummy.. Salads even yummier and packaged to go, say if your a girl like me.. on the go.. on the fly! Parking is awful. Literally you may have to wait and mame to get a place on the weekends! Park up the street and walk!"}
{"text":"Yes we have been fans for years.  However a couple of things that I am tired of and hopefully the ownership will do something about it.  In 2016 we spent over $ 3,400 here at LGO.  First inform your female staff that they are not why people come there. They stand and talk to each other and just ignore the people in line.  Smug & snotty has become the norm and there are days that I think we have to be nuts for accepting it. I have heard it from so many locals that have moved on to a newer area restaurant.Second, turn the music down!  Come on man there is no reason to have the music at concert level..  Think about it, do people ever come to your place to listen to loud music.  Once again we have talked to so many locals that no longer meet there to yell at one another while trying to eat and talk."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  Excellent food, superior iced tea and a fabulous environment.  The only problem .... is the parking. It is next to impossible! Usually I just valet but sometimes I am lucky to find a spot (depending on what time of day and what day of the week it is!)  I highly recommend the Cubano sandwich, the Padre pizza and their iced tea (w/ an orange and one Equal, mmm, it's delish.)  And if you have to wait in line for 10-15 mins, trust me.. it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  Airport food at its finest.  When at the PHX airport, skip the typical fast food options--this place is a must!  With an emphasis on high-quality, fresh, and interesting, this little hotspot in Terminal D has a global undercurrent.  The food is amazing -- burgers, sandwiches,  salads, pizza, gelato, desserts, and beer/wine.  Funky, euro music, ample seating, and quick service."}
{"text":"Who woulda thought that the best Margherita Pizza I would ever have was here at the airport in Phoenix.  This is almost worth a separate trip!  It looks like they also do burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, and even sushi.    I'll have to stop by again and try the other menu items. Don't miss out if you are passing through!  I know I won't."}
{"text":"OK.  This place is really good and you should give it a try but you should also know what to expect as there is a lot going on.  Inside this \"grocery\" are very few groceries!  It does sell a lot of neat but expensive candles, lotions, etc...  The food is really good!  I had the Reuben sandwich but everything I saw looked good.  There is no table service.  You will place an order and then wait for your food at the counter.  There are a couple of bars in the grocery as well so you will be able to get an adult beverage with your meal if you so choose.  A great and unique place but like I said.  There is a lot going on and it takes a minute to figure out how everything works.  Don't let that scare you though.  All first timers here seem to have that reaction."}
{"text":"First off, amazing orange juice.  Though, if you messed that up and called yourself \"The Big Orange,\" full stop.  Drop out now.  No need to, though, because this tasted freshly squeezed with the perfect flavor and texture.  The Zuni breakfast burrito I had was very good as well.  Not mind blowing, but solid for airport food.  Speaking of which, LGO is a great alternative to your typical airport fare.  With a wide variety of menu items for virtually any time of day, this was a pleasant departure from most terminal grub."}
{"text":"Cute \"gift shop,\" superb food, awesome location, great aesthetic and amazing cookies."}
{"text":"I travel every week and hope to get the D gates at PHX so I can get my gluten free cookie from LGO.  The variety of food and baked goods is great for an airport.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that sometimes the wait times for food is a little long for the busy/always late traveler."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here even though I've driven by it several times.  Lots of people but well worth the wait. For now I just tried an iced coffee with a pastry which was absolutely delicious. They have lots of knickknacks, books etc for sale! As people walk by I saw their plates in the breakfast look absolutely delicious everything made fresh! I will be going back very soon to try out their meals :-)"}
{"text":"LGO - I love and trust you but today you let me down.  Running lye for a flight and willing to pay $12 for a BLT since you usually rock it.  Now I'm stuck on a plane with a slimy tomato, paper thin bacon, and just enough green spread on the bun to give the illusion of guacamole. The lettuce was extraordinary in quality and quantity.  You dropped the ball today. :-("}
{"text":"Awesome idea!  We stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar.  We saw a couple drinking a six pack at the grocery store's outdoor seating and thought - we're so there!  Not only is it a quaint local grocery store but they also serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique.  We tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily.  We also shared their hostess like cupcake - so good.  And of course beer!  I'd love to come back for breakfast as their english muffins are fresh and to die for."}
{"text":"This place is really fun, I love the cafe/grocery/marketplace combination :) there's not much room to move around since it's so crowded, but we were able to find a table. Amazing chicken salad and pretty good bakery items too! :)   A good thing to know is that there's extra parking for LGO less than a mile down the street...parking in the main lot in front is hard to get!"}
{"text":"I come to LGO daily for coffee and usually on the weekends for breakfast. The service is always wonderful. I'm impressed at the staff's ability to handle the crowd and always get things right. I was there this weekend and ate outside and had an incident with a bird swooping down and taking my eggs. I took it in and offered to pay for another and the chef took my receipt and refused to let me pay. To top it off, he brought my order outside to me. I'm always satisfied when I eat there but I was really impressed at the extra effort. I live walking distance and will continue to come daily."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions. $14 for a tiny kale and chicken salad. Crazy! Customer service mediocre. They are not what they used to be. So disappointing for the Chelsea's Family Restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to spend my afternoons. I nanny in the area, and while the kids are at dance, I always head over to LGO. I love the atmosphere, the food (especially the treats! Salty chocolate chip cookie anyone?) and the selection of books/clothes/gifts etc. They have great wine and cheese too! And to wrap it all up, they have free wifi, so I can do some homework while I enjoy my afternoon snack."}
{"text":"WOW!  While it is a bit chaotic, and my order took about 20 minutes (they gave me 2 free breakfasts for the wait), their breakfast was the BOMB!!!  I had a large coffee (delicious Viennese blend) and the Croque Madame.  Un-freakin-believable! They threw some grilled tomatoes into the mix of this fantastic dish. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the toast stayed crisp (soggy bread with a crooque madame suck). I had a couple of bites of my wife's commuter sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, tomatoes on fresh baked English Muffins) which was also delicious!  Again, if I ever find myself in the desert again, I'll hit this up each and every morning for wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey!"}
{"text":"Fun brunch atmosphere, romantic dinner atmosphere. Great location, service and wonderful food. They always have a few (super delicious) gluten free baked goods to choose from that go great with their amazing coffees in the morning. Great gluten free pizza and salads. Very fun place to eat, great for a date! Amazing gelato too. I don't know anyone that doesn't love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the people that work there are amazing. But I have to say, if you're ordering the spicy chickpeas lettuce wrap and just love the taste of pure chili powder, then order it. If not, steer clear."}
{"text":"The only thing I can think of while I was eating my soup was what was I thinking. I should've just save my appetite till I came home.  I would have been starving, but I rather be starving than had eaten that disgusting soup.  I could have saved my five dollars for this disgusting, salty, chicken vegetable soup."}
{"text":"Great little place to wait for you plane in Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. I found a corner with a table and an outlet to plug in my laptop to enjoy a latte and catch up on some work. The sandwiches are good. I saw some people with pizzas, pastas and salads. Not your normal airport food."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever. Toast was not toasted and omelet had RUNNY EGGS. OMLETS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE RUNNY EGGS!!!! OMLETS was watery and greasey. $16.25 for this garbage. It's not like they were busy either. They could have taken their time... I will not be coming back here again.   Update: got a refund. Changed to two stars."}

{"text":"Valet parking for groceries and a sandwich?  I don't get it.  I finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers. First parking was a real issue and I hate having to valet my car.  Once we were inside there was a very long line, with a less than inspired menu of sandwiches salads and a few burgers.  I went with  a veggie sandwich, the ingredients may have been local and organic but who cares when its small and not tasty.  If you want to seem emo  trendy and impress a girl and go to a locals only joint then check it out, otherwise don't bother.  Also the whole grocery part escapes me unless you can live on birdseed and condiments."}
{"text":"There's a big part of me that want to talk a lot of smack about the trendy hipster vibe of this place... but bottom-line they have great food, and a wonderful wine, bubbly, and beer selection.  Are the owners from California because it totally seems like it....  Fresh kale salad, the best red velet cake ever (this is not a compliment I dole out lightly,) and I love their vegan pizza.  Fresh pesto heaped with veggies. So. good. There's actually some left over in my fridge right now.  It's a shit-show on Saturday mornings- packed with terrible parking.  I'd say the prices are slightly high and the girls that work the front counter can act 'too cool' but its great place to watch awkward first dates, men in sleeveless shirts, and girls in lululemon riding fixies.  The to-go ordering is really efficient and delicious. Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"My friend had a bad experience at LGO a couple of weeks ago. She wrote a 2 star review about her experience and the business invited her back for an opportunity to make things right. She invited us to join her for an impromptu breakfast. We were walked to the back of the kitchen where Chef Cole was kind enough to pack up some freshly baked brownies for us. He also hooked us up with whatever we wanted at no cost. Wow... I mean they went out of their way to make things right! My boyfriend and I shared the commuter - our protein of choice was bacon. It was packed with bacon between the english muffin - the best english muffin ever. They make it fresh and from scratch. We also shared the chai latte which was good but we are smitten with the extra sweet chai latte at Starbucks. We did try a couple of bites of the brownie there - I thought it was too sweet but the boyfriends really liked it. Apparently Italians love their sweets. Go figure! lol  Anyway, they have definitely won me over with going above and beyond their duty to make things right. I would come back to try some of their other sandwiches and sweets."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit, a delicious dessert, or something fun from the the store!"}
{"text":"Great energy and tasty food.  If you can find parking and a seat, it's a great place to come and grub on a lazy Sunday.  Had the Thai Chicken Salad, and the spicy ahi, while the wife had the veggie burger.  Great place.  I've eaten here twice in the last week.  I see  what the obsession is all about.  You just feel cool when you eat here."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ALL HYPE. I have eaten here a few times. The lines are long and the crowd totally pretentious and obnoxious!! Most come in in there workout gear and have not eveb broke a sweat. The rest are a bunch of snotty tool bags. The food. Mediocre at best. The commuter was tasteless, no wait it tasted greasy!! It was disgusting. The egg white omelet was flavorless crap! The croq. was a joke! I can melt ham and cheese on bread with an egg and it would taste less greasy and have 10 times the flavor, not to mention be a lot cheaper than this garbage. I have had lunch here too and the sandwiches are something I can make at home. I've tried to like this place. It seems cute, it seems like they put out good food due the massive crowds but to be honest it's a joke. I am from California and this is just a hyped up place that people with no taste for food love and flock too. I have had way way better food at places with plates not more expensive than $4.00. These people are making money of folks with no pallet! I e-mailed LGO to let them know my last meal there and service was awful and that I would never return due to the crappy food. I never recieved an answer to this day. It's been 6 months. I am sure they could careless as they are just laughing at all you numb tongued folk returning day after day for their bad food and to be seen while flaunting your new workout gear! Trust me, this place is a joke. I will never return. Never! I rather make my own breakfast or lunch than spend a dime on tasteless food. The pizza sucks too BTW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love you, your cookies, your cupcakes and your goods. That is all."}
{"text":"Normally \"airport food\" and \"good\" don't go together, but La Grande Orange at Phoenix Sky Harbor is your best bet for airport dining.  They stress quality in their food, using more natural ingredients and providing healthier options.  They make their pizzas from scratch which are made to order in their wood fired oven, unless you want to pick one up already made and heated.  They also have an array of pre-made salads and sandwiches, as well as a menu where you can order something freshly made.  Lots of variety.  Vegetarian and vegan friendly too.  Breakfast served until 5:00PM.  Service is fast.  There is a seating area out front but hard to find a table.  Yes, it is quite pricey, but what can you expect from being trapped in an airport.  At least spend it on good quality food."}
{"text":"Any place that makes a BLT with avocado is tops in my book because bacon and avocado might possibly be my favorite two food groups. (Yes, they are their own food group.)  Beyond that this place is super charming. I loved everything about it. From the novelty candies to the delicious dessert case to the kitschy toys to the kitchen items. I actually thought this place was initially called \"La Garage\" because it was such a mish-mash of cool stuff.  I imagine if I lived in Phoenix I'd be here quite often."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I've been a Yelper for three years and have not made it down here before.  LGO is an eccelctic place with cute-kitchy things to buy, delicious coffee options, and a fantastic menu. I have only been here for breakfast, but I have to say that I was impressed. Ok, so I was not that impressed when it arrived- it was one of those times when my dish looked small but was actually extremely tasty and filling. I ordered the Venice Beach Burrito. Another friend had the Jersey Girl Omelet (it was very entertaining to watch a large Russian man order this). Hubski had the commuter with salmon. It should be noted that The Commuter sandwich came with a veritable ton of salmon. The lox was bright pink, cut in thick slices and piled on.  The pizza looked delicious, so we'll be back for that. I was alo interested in getting one of the many Tammy Coe pastry options, but I was just too damned full. LGO, I'll be back."}
{"text":"O B S E S S E D  Terminal D. Go out of your way to eat here when you are in the airport.  My personal favorite:  kale and quinoa salad.  It is adorned with parmesean cheese, grapes, sunflower seeds and lemon zest.  The dressing perfectly compliments this grouping and always leaves me satisfied! The fruit tarts are amazing- no jellies, just fruit and an amazing pastry crust!  And something I NEVER would have tried, but they sampled one day:  the gluten free walnut, chocolate chip cookie!  It is almost gooey in the center with a brownie-like taste.  It is just amazing! The pizzas are also fantastic and the veggie burger goes a long way when I have a few extra minutes to wait for them to make me something or I'm feeling like veggin' out. All I know is that I don't miss getting something from here when I am in this airport and you will thank me for this!"}
{"text":"Have to go.. it's a great experience fun and stylish I think it's a treat for the senses"}
{"text":"My addiction started with neighboring Misfit in Santa Monica. I had no idea LGO was a small group of restaurants originally started in Phoenix. After many, many excellent Misfit meals I decided to eat my way through each of their unique dining experiences back to the original which I believe is LGO Grocery.   Here, my favorite Kale salad with the awesome grapes sits in a plastic container to go for only $7.50. It doesn't look happy, so I snag one along with an ahi sandwich to share. Eating here could be an adventure, but we missed the lunch rush. Choices are the floor of the grocery, (bad idea), the restaurant which isn't open yet or the 96 degree beautiful day. Hmmm.....the empty restaurant seems logical. Here, I find china, silverware, drinks, glasses, ice, etc and I'm able to correct the presentation of the wonderful kale salad which makes it taste much better!   The ahi sandwich is a first---I've never seen in in the Pasadena LGO (a completely different concept), or the Luggage Room (also in Pasadena).  LGO Grocery also sells Italian recipe authentic homemade gelato. Incredible! Oh, and did I mention there's a coffee bar with great coffees and a knowledgeable barista!   Wow, the only thing I missed was the cookies, but the raspberry and espresso gelatos were wonderful as was the entire experience.  As for the store, cute stuff, nice food items and an excellent wine selection. There was a lot of rare Northwest Pinot Noirs, Red Blend and other favorites. Apparently, free corkage during happy hour, too!  Now, I understand the genesis of Misfit and next stop is Chelsea's Kitchen.  Food 5 star Ambiance 5 star Staff 5+ star"}
{"text":"Good food. Good coffee. Friendly service. Had the breakfast burrito & a small drip coffee. A little pricey at $11, but better than the alternatives without having to walk too far from Concourse D in Term 4."}
{"text":"Healthy lunch option in the airport. Got a delish kale quinoa salad before my flight that I really enjoyed! Lots of sandwiches and salads to choose from along with baked goods should you desire. Serves breakfast food until 5 pm. Check it out if you're in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"The customer service was great! The food was just as good! I had the breakfast with eggs and toast. Simple but good!"}
{"text":"Coffee and the red velvet cake were good. The place is really tight and hard to bring in a wheelchair. I ran into everything. Only complaint :)"}
{"text":"I moved from L.A. to Phoenix a few years ago and missed the little cool small shop restaurant places with character.  Le Grande Orange made me feel at home, and now that I'm back in L.A. I'm super psyched to find out there seems to be a new one opening in Pasadena.  Does anyone know if this is the same owners?  Looks like it.  I HOPE SO!!!"}
{"text":"Had our last lunch here and it was so delicious!!! I had the Ricky Martin (I added avocado) and I was impressed! I wish we had this spot in Dallas. Very good food, service was perfect, and the freshly squeezed orange juice...just yes! I wish I could've ordered everything off the menu, but we had a flight to catch. I forgot the name of what my husband ordered, but it was a breakfast burrito of some sort and he shared his fries with me, which were also delicious. Great place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a family favourite  because they have it all! Delicious pizza, huge selection of beers/cocktails, a tap room, baked goods, coffee,  a shop that sells all the cute little items that you don't need but want!   I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Their zuni breakfast burrito is a favorite, also tried their iced honey latte and I am hooked! I have pretty much tried every single pizza on their menu and they were all excellent. We usually stuff our bellies with the pizza and make the short walk over to the bakery, get dessert and coffee and enjoy it on one of their many outside tables!   Overall, this place will somehow cater to everyone in your group! If they don't like the food, which is unlikely, they can definitely spend their money on some organic candles, a Paulo Coelho inspirational calendar and what not!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants/businesses in the valley for so many reasons - since there are already a couple hundred reviews I'll try to keep my review somewhat original!    One: I love the location.  I don't even mind that there is a parking issue most of the time, I mean how can you blame them for that? It's in a great neighbosrhood and I think they have made the most of the parking space they have - I've never really viewed the popularity of this place as a negative.    Two: For such a busy place, I think they do a great job with customer service.  Because of the nature of the restaurant (ordering at a counter, picking up your food when they call your name) you don't get a lot of chances for one-on-one rapport building and encounters with the staff are pretty brief, but always pleasant.  I love that it's efficient and on the rare occasions I already know what I want to order the staff behind the register can somehow quickly sense my determination and call me to the front.  If, like yesterday , I want to peruse the menu, there are usually girls walking through the line handing out menus so you don't have to stare up at the chalk board.  I originally grabbed a salad out of the cold case and brought it up to the register. I asked if I could have it without cheese and extra beets, they made me a fresh to-go salad in no time and were super friendly about my requests.    Three: Every single thing I've had here has been delicious.  I try to get different things every once in a while and I've never been disappointed! Yesterday I had the Sonoma chop salad which is amazing and also grabbed a thai chicken salad for a friend and it's my new favorite thing.    I hope people will continue to patronize this beautiful little eatery that we are so lucky to have in Arcadia.  If you are new to LGO, keep an open mind and I think you will find that the great things about it absolutely outweigh the \"bad.\""}
{"text":"LGO has just gone down a million notches for me. I am so sorely disappointed to find out they no longer carry Tammie Coe baked goods, which were the main reason I chose to visit in the mornings for a muffin or after dinner for a delicious sweet ending.   When I asked the front cashier about it, she said they wanted to take on the baking responsibilities themselves, which I understood, so I gave them a chance. The Princess Cupcake was *so* god awful flavorless with a horrible texture that I ended up giving it away. Seriously, who makes an awful cupcake?!   I also tried a new muffin- slice of heaven-which was good, and an oatmeal raisin vegan cookie, and the butterscotch oatmeal cookie. The butterscotch one was good, but all else fell short of expectations. I am sad to say, I think I need to find a new favorite place.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I've had in the valley. It tasted even better than Pizzeria Bianco. Giving it 4 stars only because the pizza was greasy to the point that it was soggy within minutes."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood grocery store.  The have more of the specialty items... it's not like you can get everything here.  They do have a good Sandwich bar and also make great pizza's and salads at the restaurant end of the store."}
{"text":"Taking airport food to a higher level Granted they get almost $8 for a pair of eggs but youll also get chicken sausage, a fruit cup and and some funky toast. The free fudge while you wait isn't bad either"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is great. I go at least twice a week. Ashley is one of the waitresses and she is Amazing, and is one of the reason I keep coming back. I can't get enough of this place. They have yummy appetizers like the ceviche or chip platter trio. The roasted corn pizza is also amazing. Don't forget to try desert, the warm sea salted brownie with a scoop of vanilla gelato is too die for. Definitely one of the best places in the city. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall, I found this place disappointing. Despite the name and orange theme, orange flavored dishes, even orange juice, are not on the menu. The entrance is surrounded by bottled water, evidently the most high margin item. The food itself was simply shameful, flaccid, damp, bitter French fries, unceremoniously shoved in a paper bag without napkins, grease seeping through easily. The green chillie burger was just a sloppy mess, served with unmelted, shredded cheddar. Go elsewhere.  Edit: LGO, to their credit, reimbursed the cost of my meal after reading this review. Thank you."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.  I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else says, this places is auhhhmazzzinngg. I have never ever ever had a bad meal here. They have everything that you can ever imagine. I mean if I am feeling for an omelet, I can get one of the many that they serve all day- mmhmm my breakfast cravings can always be fulfilled. If breakfast foods aren't your thing, there are plenty of salads, sandwiches, pizzas and daily specialties. (It's always so hard to choose!) I think the best selection is on the weekends but you are going to have to risk the crowds.    Normally I get one of their salads, but this time I got a gluten free pizza. (their new specialty) Um yummy!! I want to make it clear how hard it is to have delicious gluten free pizza. Normally GF pizza is hard and dry- and bland uck!. It was ooey gooey goodness with more of a cracker thin crust- fine by me, I have another yummy pizza place on my list! I was literally dancing in my seat because I had found another place place to go out to.  (My mother finds it quite funny when I do my \"Happy Dance\")  Try Tammie Coe's cupcakes and cakes, I mean yes they are expensive but if you want a celebration in your mouth fork over the 3 bucks, it will be well worth it. If you are a true friend buy your comrade a birthday cake here, they will be indebted to you forever.   You may wonder, why did this girl give only three stars? She must be crazy and have outrageous expectations. (I really don't I promise) I mean if I was only rating the food, sure I would give it five out of five stars in a heartbeat. But seriously, there is NO parking, I mean none at all. It is beyond frustrating to drive a bit to come to this delectable haven only to find yourself without a parking spot. Once in a while there is valet, but I don't rely on it because I have been there a couple of times and have to search for a good twenty minutes to get a smig of a spot. (I sometimes have to get creative) And the confusion continues when you walk inside. Yes the grocery is cute but it's a traffic jam just to order. I always seem to find myself running into the cute little nick nacks or into another customer. I like my space and always feel crammed when ordering. And I NEVER go during peak hours, if you do you will never find a seat. I will have to be sneaky and search around the dining room eyeing who may be done with their meal and nonchalantly wait for the table. It's like a game, but it seems that I can never win at.  Okay yelpers, don't cross this place off your list, it really is delicious and I always have an enjoyable time. Just be prepared to work a little to have a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the feel and the food selection at this place!  Beat gluten free pizza .. amazing for the airport"}
{"text":"Had the chick pea lettuce wrap. As a vegan, I greatly appreciated the option. Super favorable and maybe a touch more spicy than I would want."}
{"text":"Cubano hot sandwich is really good!!  Ham, pickles & Cheese.  FAST & FRIENDLY STAFF......just what you need when you're in a rush to catch a flight ."}
{"text":"I really wasn't that impressed. I had a Turkey sandwich and they really don't have a great option of breads. I was forced to eat here waiting for a connecting flight because it seemed like the only decent place around. I'd be interested in their breakfast.  Very Average meal that of course because it's in a restaurant I paid a price for. i'd give it another try, they would really have to impress me to get any more stars."}
{"text":"A great place to go for lunch and a wonderful array of sweet treats. The best thing to get are they English muffins which are super delicious. I get them for gifts and freeze them since I'm rarely in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at LGO very often but when I have I am always pleased with the food there. They seem a bit short-staffed whenever I do go and if you are trying to have a business meeting be prepared for very loud music. If you are there to just take advantage of the free WiFi and good food then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had 2 quick layovers for my trip to and from Miami and I'm really glad that they stopped in Phoenix both times. It's not often you find decent airport food but La Grande Orange definitely altered my mindset on that. For those not as into sandwiches as I am, there are also pizzas, burgers, salads, omelettes, gelato soups, etc.   My girlfriend and I got the Stacked Turkey Sandwich both times and they were equally as amazing. I'm also a lover of all sandwiches, but this was unlike any airport food I've ever had. The contents were super fresh and they didn't skim on anything. It's a really great spot to grab a quick meal and the prices aren't terrible as well. They do stop making fresh sandwiches quite early, but the cooked foods are available until closing. Highly recommend if you have a stop in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Four stars ONLY due to lack of convenience.  Must schedule trips around \"rush hour\" to prevent searching for a parking spot and waiting in long lines.  The place is crowded for a reason.  Must have items include chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with sea salt, the dressing on the caesar salad and the coffee served for breakfast.  Service is great...staff always very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night with a sweet tooth and the place was pretty busy. We were promptly greeted when walked in, and we were immediately drawn to the case full of baked goods.  I had the Peanut butter pie, OHMYGOD. Stupid good.   We also have done cookies, cupcakes, and the old fashioned cupcake (like a hostess cupcake)   Literally everything is good, the service, the decor, the wine and beer selection, and the bakery (obvi)   Just go here, pretty much every chance you get. Skinny doesn't feel as good as this stuff tastes."}
{"text":"Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?  When you \"drool a little bit\" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.  I went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!  If it weren't for the \"Drool Event\" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.  I shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.  My son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.  The \"Olive Oil Cake\" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \"oilier\" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \"Oh My God!\" good.  Now for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.  It was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \"to go\" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.  Great.  Decision.  I don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.  I just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.  Not too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.  I WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!  You get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!  I mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)  Yes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.  We love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy."}
{"text":"Close friends of mine live right across the street so we walked to La Grande for brunch one morning-- actually it was after lunch time, but hell, to us, it was brunch.  Anyhow, I walked in and saw what appeared to be a pizza joint.  A pizza joint?  They didn't tell me we were going to get pizza.  Then we ventured to the other side of the store, and there was food everywhere!  On the shelves, behind the counter, up on the walls-- everywhere!  It was like a grocery store of ready-made food!  Anyhow the meal we had of sushi, salad and a BLT sandwich was absolutely delicious, the crowd very much like our group-- hungover and hungry.  Self-seating, self-buying, sandwiches made to order, pizza made to order-- perfect for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Quick review here because everyone and their dog has reviewed them....  Highlights: -An eclectic menu in the main shop, from healthy breakfast options to Sushi..they have it covered -Dogs....DOGS EVERYWHERE! Bring your pooch, they are dog friendly -They have an amazing gelato selection. I love gelato. You should too -The coffee is amazing. My dad said that...he drinks drip each and every day. He is 72. He knows his coffee. Enjoy the coffee -They have great knickknacks which reminds me of Duck and Decanter -The pizza is OK....nothing to write home about. Its basic pizza in my mind -Their English Muffins are outstanding. They sell them individually. Get some -The wine selection is great and all...but why not just go to Total Wine? -The parking situation is just that: a situation...c'mon guys! -The girl outside manning the coffee station...she was a blonde...she was horrible. If you are out there on a Sat/Sun and she is there, beware -They need more tables...where are all the outside tables? TABLES! TABLES!  4 stars goes to La Grande for consistently amazing food, wide variety of options, generally good service, and all located in a great location next to two other community staples (Postinos Arcadia & Ingos). They lose a star for poor parking and lack of tablespace for all of us groups looking to hangity hang."}
{"text":"Very good food! Fresh vegetables, fresh breads! Amazing! I was visiting AZ and a friend recommended I check it out and I was soooo pleased with the environment, cleanliness, and quality of everything. I had a goat cheese pizza with cherry tomatoes and basil that was soo delicious.  I also, recommend the smoked bacon apple tuna sandwich and seriously took tuna to another level! Their desserts!! Where do I begin!! .. from the chocolate chunk sea salt cookie to the red velvet cake! I couldn't leave without taking more home for everyone. I cant wait to go back to AZ for another visit!"}
{"text":"There's a problem I have with Yelp*. Mind you, overall I have a very healthy, satisfying relationship with Yelp but here's the thing: I'm either prematurely turned off to what may be perfectly wonderful (or perfectly wonderful to me) places due to poor reviews - or I'm completely revved up and expecting the seas to part upon entering a heavily-favoured Yelpdefreakinglicious joint.  And then I walk in and it's sensory overkill, overrated central, packed to the brim, the turkey I was assured was carved was in actuality pressed, the sandwich was overly greasy and lukewarm, and the pricetag left me pondering the meal I had on a styrofoam plate quite thoroughly.  Such was my experience with La Grande. But see, it wasn't horrible. It wasn't even bad. It just wasn't as good as I had expected. Because it wasn't as good as it had been Yelped. So I think it's a 3-star venue. I think.  *I also find I can have this problem with \"reviews\" in general and also \"advice.\""}
{"text":"Such a cool alternative to the standard food at an airport.  Excellent coffee and the pastries are INSANE!  Make sure you walk past Peete's if you want coffee, this place is way better.  Not my favorite for actual meals like sandwiches and stuff, but they handle it for breakfast"}
{"text":"First time here and heard this place was great and was in need of coffee. Couldn't talk myself out of a breakfast sandwich and it was incredible. Chicken sausage on the most amazing English muffin. Coffee was great too and the staff was perfect! Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab something quick while we waited to board our flight home to California and this was the only place that looked decent in our terminal. The seating area was packed with people and their luggage but I table opened up and we snagged it. I got in line to get our food and was handed a menu. There were a lot of options but it was mainly different combinations of the same thing. I ended up ordered a BLT, which took forever to make. and a breakfast burrito, which was the quickest. If Peets was closer to us (we were dead tired from Spring Training) then I would have just gone there and spent less money for better coffee and breakfast.   The BLT had a lot of avocado and bacon on it but it was not worth $9+ and the breakfast burrito, from what my boyfriend said, was okay.   I don't think I'd go back to this place unless it was the only option."}
{"text":"Come here on a Sunday when you're hungover. Pick a table in the center of the dining room, and stare out the window wondering why, between Mastro's last night and El Santo all day Saturday you spent, oh wait, and the Candy Store was in there someplace, over 700 bucks this weekend.  This place is pretty eclectic with its high energy young crowd adorned in yoga pants, and, its older hipsters, also wearing yoga pants.It would appear this place is some kind of Mecca for yoga pants aficionados. The music is cool too. A friend recently spent the day here working, Shazam'ing the entire time, saying; \"You can find the same music on Pandora's 'Lumineers' station.\"  Anyway, I ate a chopped turkey salad, or at least a part of it while pensively gazing out the windows, as If trying to come up with a cure for cancer or something.  The salad and a soda was ten bucks.  This is a great move, staring out of windows. Others will think you're an eccentric genius or something as you stare directly through them, mindlessly revisiting your bonehead moves from the weekend, chuckling to yourself every now and again as you think about  that stripper showing off her false teeth for a dollar. Who does that?   As I said, this is a great place to feel good about yourself when you get a load of the granny hipsters in their unfulfilled (pancake butt) yoga pants that oddly enough, manage to telegraph the outline of an equally loose fitting thong.  Eeew, and double eeew. (Eeew)   I yakked up the salad afterwards, but it had nothing to do with the food or the ill-fated thongs. I think it was the egg and my hellacious hangover. The thong visual was pretty messed up though."}
{"text":"I used to sware by this place but now that you have to valet I am over it.  The parking situation is the fucking worst thing ever, and don't think you can park on the street and get away with it. The cops hover like flys on shit to pass out parking tickets here. The spanish latte is killer. The commuter sandwich is yummy. All the food is good as well as the sweet stuff. I have never found a bad bottle of wine here, whomever is doing the ordering has a god palete. So if you can battle it out in the parking lot, once you get inside good things happen!"}
{"text":"Ordered a smoked salmon commuter sandwich with harvarti cheese and avocado. The sandwich was superb. The freshly made English mifflin was definitely a nice touch.  The only thing to complain about was that it was hard to keep things from falling out of the sandwich. Perhaps more toothpicks?"}
{"text":"Yay for healthier airport food! I admittedly didn't love what I had but they had options that I loved so I'm still giving them 3 stars. I had the egg white omelet with turkey, and then fresh salsa with cherry tomatoes and avocado on the side. The salsa was great, the omelet was greasy and needed salt. However, when do you get an airport restaurant that offers eggs and breakfast food all day? I was just happy to see something besides burgers, bars and pre-made sandwiches. So I can't complain. Plus they had a great selection of healthy desserts on display. (Depends on what your definition of healthy is I guess- gluten free, things like that)"}
{"text":"If you go to LGO Grocery on a Sunday morning for breakfast or brunch and you see the parking lot is full and there is a line out the door, please don't turn around and go some where else, please! You will not be disappointed with the wait! Or just pass it by so there is one less person in front of ME!!!   The quality of food is untouchable! Okay, really their homemade english muffins are what is untouchable! Try the commuter sandwich, yes it is on one of their AMAZING homemade english muffins. If you have been to LGO next door for a meal, then you know the quality of the food is top notch, well there is nothing disappointing about their Grocery!  Oh and please don't forget to pick up a Tammy Coe Red Velvet Cupcake, they are the best I have had to date! The cupcakes can be found in the glass case below the menus. And they are full of the most divine treats you will come across.  LGO Grocery you are truly amazing and addictive. I find myself making excuses to pass by, just so I can stop in for some tasty treats."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! I'm here  2-3 a week! My boyfriend and I are going to moving and we are basing our location around LGO. Thats how much we love this place! The food is so stinking good and fresh and local!! I have had almost everything on that menu including the beverages. My new favorite sandwich Is the Hot-pressed tuna. My other favs are the tuna steak sandwich, and hot-pressed cubano! And don't worry u vegetarians they have wonderful and oh-so delicious dishes for you too!   And if you are a celiac like a couple of my good friends their gluten free pizza's are ridiculously yummy!! I actually prefer the gluten-free over the regular crust however the regular crust melts in your mouth!  I have never had one bad thing to eat here. I highly recommend bring yourself,friends and family members here. And if you just finished an exciting hike on camelback mountain immediately get her for a cocoanut water to rehydrate, then refresh with a beer and sandwich sit outside and take it all in. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Quick layover in AZ. I grabbed a scrambled eggs, toast, bacon meal and my daughter had the turkey avocado sandwich. Both were delicious. Ordering and receiving was a little confusing. There were lines of people waiting to pickup their food and people would walk up to order their food and stand behind them. Cashier was available. This could be fixed I think. Food was great and so was the service. If I'm ever hungry and in the AZ airport I will stop here again:)"}
{"text":"The commuter sandwich with avocado was amazing.  I enjoyed the eclectic decor and impressive wine offerings.  Great vibe overall.  Tons of amazing looking things were coming out of the open kitchen."}
{"text":"The Good - food, shopping for worthless  tchotchkes, nice patio, dog friendly.  The Bad - overcrowded, listening to the boring yuppie a-holes is unavoidable, dogs everywhere."}
{"text":"Ordered the scrambled eggs, fruit, and toast. I should've know better. Crappy eggs, a hunk of not ripe pineapple, and cold dry toast. Not worth the almost $7. Learned my lesson...  Upgraded to 3 stars because they reached out to me based on my review and seem to genuinely care. I appreciate their time and effort to improve."}
{"text":"Pizza was average, salads come in a to-go box. The bakery was pretty disappointing as well, the macarons were warm. They should be room temperature or chilled.  To get the attention of waiting customers, the Kitchen and servers will shout out names at the top of their lungs to pick up their food. This happened a few times when we were at the counter ordering, actually left ringing in my ears for a moment . There could probably be a better system that just shouting at your customers. I guess this could be a cool spot if you're nearby and like eating average food but there's plenty of other great places nearby so I say skip."}
{"text":"A fun and tasty menu in an adorable shop tucked into a super cute little area.  A wonderful selection of breads to take home (among which are their famous giant English muffins), breakfast, sandwiches and salads, delectable desserts at reasonable prices.  Lots of patio seating, and super busy just about any time (weekends most of all), with spotty service.    FOOD: If you're breakfasting here, the commuter is incredible! Try it with salmon and avocado, but be sure to leave room for dessert!  The French pancakes are swell, and so is everything else I've tried, but the commuter is far and away the winner, whether you add any kind of meat or not.  If you're going for healthy, get the mayo on the side.  Red velvet anything is great here, as is the key lime pie.    SHOP: The odds-n-ends shop is my favorite eclectic collection around - I measure other cute shops by their yard stick (e.g. \"this place is kinda cute in a La Grande Orange kind of way\" - but no other place quite measures up).  I've bought kitchen supplies, clothing, jewelry, books, dog toys...I could go on.  Everything is at least a little bit interesting!  I highly recommend the Out of Print and Yoganastix clothing brands - I've bought both from here and they've stayed soft and nice with much wear.     SERVICE: To be honest, the service is spotty to poor.  For a while, I had orders mixed up almost as often as correct - with no apologetic attitude, to boot - and I stopped going.  My last few visits have been pretty great (aside from overhearing a woman who had terrible service getting no help at all to make it better).  It's definitely a risk.  It's so popular that the counter employees don't seem concerned with customer service at all (the servers in the main restaurant are great, if you come for a sit-down dinner, but that's a different Yelp listing)."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, sandwiches, and hamburgers. All came out in a timely manner and tasted pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I think their Kale & Quinoa salad is the best salad I've ever had in an airport. Might be one of the best salads I've had, period! Kale is so chock-full of vitamins, but sometimes it's so darn tough. This kale was  tender and thinly shredded; topped w/ nutty quinoa, chopped red bell pepper, sunflower seeds, grapes, shredded Reggio cheese, and a tangy, lemony-garlicky dressing. Very generous portion, too.  I was at the farthest possible gate away (A-30), but had an hour between flights, so took a brisk walk through Terminals A, B, and C until I finally got to D. My FitBit clocked it at 1 mile each way, but totally worth it. Got 2 miles of Excercise AND an amazing salad. Can I create this salad at home? I'm going to try!  They have other great-sounding salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, desserts, coffee, drinks, wine and beer, too. This will be a must-stop on any future trips through the Phoenix airport!"}
{"text":"All of you that love this place, seriously?  I've been to the airport location a number of times and always disappointing or bad.  If you want a water, a bag of English muffins, or maybe a cup of fruit then it's fine.  I just ordered eggs, sausage, fruit, and an English muffin.  They weren't scrambled but just one flat thin overcooked egg.  The sausage was disgusting.  So overcooked and hard it clearly came from early early this morning and sat or from yesterday and was warmed.  The fruit cup, different than the prepackaged fruit they sell separately, was dark brown around all the edges.  Look at my other reviews and you'll find that I am always consistent with reviews and give places a second chance.  I've been to their main Phoenix location and the market was great. The food we had their was mildly disappointing to average.  I will not spend another dollar here.  When you leave a review try to forget your perception of the place and how awesome their reputation alone is.  Judge it on the experience.  This place sucks and after multiple times I've solidified that fact.   Colleagues have told me the same but they don't yelp.  Many of these popular local restaurants that have airport locations use airport employees because it's cheaper.  The exception that I'm aware of is Cartel Coffee.  They employ their own employees that have been properly trained and care about the end product.  This place just isn't worth the great tasty muffins."}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods, lunch items, coffee, and fun products! Everything cool all under one roof!  Loved their little LGO t-shirts, eco-friendly goods, fun kids items, specialty dog accessories, and even their signature mug was something special. I love unique stores like these that put a local stamp on their wares.  And I love things like homemade english muffins (HUGE!) and smores scones. DELISH. The fun cakes in their window display are from the cake shop in the same shopping center. Not to mention that they are connected to the pizzeria and gelateria so it's an easy walk through to everything.  La Grande Orange is one of those cute and cool local shops that you just cannot miss!"}
{"text":"I've stopped by the shop before but never got anything so this morning after 2 hikes I decided to come in for a cup of coffee before hiking Camelbak.  There were many employees and I was waiting at the coffee counter for about 4 minutes with no one to help me, which I don't mind so much.. I don't know if I was supposed to wait in the other line where the food was being served?  The coffee dispensers were in the other room then the regular coffee was dry.. I guess it's just bad timing.  I waited some more but at least I got a fresh hot coffee.  I would go here instead of starbucks anyday!  I'll have to return to go next door to the pizza place someday."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to enjoy tea and catch up on life with friends.  This place is super busy but so worth it! Parking is literally a nightmare but with a little luck, you just might find a good spot! ;)"}
{"text":"First, let me say that the food really is quite good, including the coffee (and I am a snob).  The staff are always friendly. That said, here are my issues: The parking is HORRIBLE with a lot out front that is very limited and I don't like valets getting in my car (nothing personal).  During peak times, the place is difficult to move around and feels very cluttered.  If you can go here during off hours and you are not in a hurry give it a try."}
{"text":"This is Arizona's best kept secret.  When I bring friends and family visiting from out of town to LGO, they all tend to marvel.  And that makes me feel like a proud resident of AZ even though I'm a fairly new transplant and still feel like an \"alien\" out here.  I love the crepe, french pancake.  However, it's annoying that they always look at me crazy when I order it and say it like the French, especially cause I speak French.    I love the music, food, vibe and ambiance.  It's a happy place."}
{"text":"Best desserts in the desert! The old timer makes me so happy! The macaroons are divine! I love the peanut butter/chocolate macaroons! With your dessert, you can have an excellent cup of coffee! This place is excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is great and healthy... and it's in an airport! Five stars for the food and three stars for the confusing ordering (nobody knew where to stand to get in line or where to wait for food). I had the kale and quinoa salad, which was great and fresh. At first, I was nervous because the salad was pre-made and self serve from a fridge; that turned out to be no problem (though I was there at the end of lunch time so perhaps the salads taste less fresh at other times). My husband had the guacamole BLT and he liked it; it was nicely toasted and there was a decent amount of bacon. If I am back in this airport, I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I happened to go here on the first day it opened, 10/6. For an airport place, for a first day, and for a duplicate of a place with quite a reputation, for once I was not disappointed!  I was a little frantic and running late for my flight, so I could not get a cooked meal. Rest assured, the friendly staff pointed me to the very well stocked cold case and I was able to get a tasty side of mixed fruit with creme fraiche for $3. There were fresh strawberries, grapes and something else, I forgot already, oops. There were definitely other choices in that cold case that I will be back for next time. The line was quick, smiles all around, and for once I got to eat something I didn't regret before flying! I have a feeling next visit will give me enough of an experience to merit the 5th star. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for breakfast. The line is not that long, and is always worth it!! I walk in feeling like it's a friends restaurant even though I don't know anyone. I leave with a smile. Get the Daybreaker. I've never liked any breakfast item more. The food is so fresh! Great selection of beverages too, since it is a Grocery as well as cafe. You can eat cheap if you want, or you can go moderate."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught this place on a bad day? I was not impressed in the least.  First of all, the organization was awful. 2 registers but so many people just standing around waiting for their food that I couldn't tell if they were in line or just waiting. The prepared salads seemed WAY overpriced for the amount of salad you actually got. Also, when asking what type of bakery was in the case, the cashier had to guess for some items which really turned me off from buying a mystery pastry.   I finally ended up with a egg sandwich on an English muffin with avocado. It was tasty, but at 8 bucks, my pockets were not pleased with my choice.  This stop was better than eating at a fast food place, but it was a clustered mess and the prices were way too high for my liking."}
{"text":"Back in the day when I was a Montreal Expos Fan, Le Grande Orange was the nickname for the red haired Rusty Staub. The Sky Harbor Airport version is more feminine (La instead of Le) and a pleasent surprise for captive eating between flights. I had the Breakfast Burrito which was really tasty and with a nice kick, despite its overall messiness. Best of all, it filled me up and lasted all the way to a late dinner tonight in Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"Airport food typically sucks, but there are a few airports that are starting to let in local credible eateries.  La Grande Orange provided me one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had.  I had to pinch myself that I found this place in an airport."}
{"text":"Condescending scottsdale-type vibe. Catty hipster staff and sleazy managers. Prepare to battle Arcadia/Scottsdale mothers and the two strollers they have clogging the tiny space while in this clutter. Pastries and food not worth the stress and anxiety I get from coming in this place. Still wondering when you guys are going to realize the parking situation is dumb and get over yourselves."}
{"text":"In town for just a few days, we came here for a Saturday breakfast, based on the recommendation of a friend (and former Phoenix resident). After we finally got a parking spot, and navigated the crowded interior... Perhaps we had high expectations, but we were really disappointed. We wanted to like it. We really wanted to like it. We were told to come back to the counter to get our food in 10 minutes. It was definitely longer than 10 minutes. While the orange juice was really great, it was unfortunately the best part of the meal. When the food was finally ready, the french pancakes seemed to have the potential to be amazing, but they were kind of cold and ended up just ok. The commuter sandwich, though good, was very oily. All in all, maybe we didn't order well, or maybe we didn't order enough, but we left pretty unsatisfied. As far as we are concerned, not good value, and not worth the chaos."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that one of the best salads I've had in a long time would be in the Phoenix airport?    The kale and quinoa salad is a must-order for anybody craving vegetables and looking for something to take on a long flight toward the east coast.  The kale and other sturdy vegetables stand up well to sitting in a plastic clamshell without getting soggy.  The quinoa adds an incredibly pleasant nuttiness and crunch.  The dressing is tangy and rounds out the dish.  Over a week later, I am still thinking about how to replicate this salad, and I can't think of the last time I've felt that way about airport food.  (I didn't care for the grapes and thought the salad would have been better without them-- but I'm not docking this review to four stars, because IT WAS AN AIRPORT.)"}
{"text":"Parking at this place is atrocious.  I think that there is valet, but running in for a quick breakfast is not worthy of valet.  Service was great, everyone was super friendly.  The grocery store has fun, cute, expensive items that you can check out while you wait for you food. With that being said, this place it high up on the trendy scale, which doesn't equate to quality.  After trolling for a place to sit for a couple minutes we wound up at a tiny patio table outside in the sun.  The chocolate croissant was pretty tasty, not overly sweet, very similar to pan dulce.  The caramel macchiato scrumptious, but the main course, the breakfast burrito, was less than stellar.  Small portions for a hefty price tag, and nothing special about the contents in the tortilla.  With all the amazing breakfast places in the Valley, this is a last resort, and coincidently it was our last resort when another breakfast place that we love was closed for the holiday."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The evening staff is INCREDIBLE!!! So personal and friendly! And went over the top for my custom last minute order! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Stepping foot into LGO makes me want to move to the Arcadia area immediately! It is absolute madness inside, filled with Lululemon clad young professionals, the smell of yummy breakfast in the air (perhaps with a hint of Michael Kors \"Very Hollywood\" ;)), smiles from all of the employees, and super cute season appropriate trinkets.   Every time I have gone it has been PACKED, but so worth the wait! A friend & I went on a Sunday morning after an intense bootcamp session to refuel with egg white omelettes, mine with avacado, hers with Veggies. Perfect AM protein fix! I've only been for breakfast, but I am dying to hit the pizzeria for dinner. Absolutely darling."}
{"text":"Whenever I step inside LGO, I feel like I've been transported to a small village in the South of France. I forget there's a cactus population down the road and a desert mountain out the window. All I can think of is how treatfully delicious their larger-than-life muffins are, how scrumptious their cookies are and how wonderfully filling their selections like the tuna melt and wood fire pizza are. Whether I'm in the mood for a cup of coffee, a full breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, a sweet tooth craving, a delicious pizza or a bottle of wine; LGO is my go-to spot.   So my suggestion is to visit LGO if you  ...Like good food  ...Like a good atmosphere ...Are looking for a place to relax and read the newspaper or magazine  ...Are looking for a place to do some off-site work during the day ...Are looking for a family-friendly and reasonably priced spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  ...Want a cup of coffee ...Want an afternoon snack  ... Are hungry   And when you do find an excuse to make your way to LGO, here are some of my top suggestions:  - Commuter Sandwich  - Crepes  - Tuna Melt  - Tuna Sandwich  - Turkey Sandwich  - Pizza  - Chelsea Kitchen Burger  - Homemade English muffins - Any cookie (my favorite is the apple one...I believe it's seasonal)  Note: If you go during lunchtime, or on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, be prepared to go on the hunt for parking and a seat once you get inside. But don't let it dissuade you from your visit. It's worth it, I promise!"}
{"text":"It's not secret that I love LGO and the fact that now I can enjoy a commuter breakfast sandwich while waiting for my flight is amazing! This is LGO airport-edition so it lacks the charm that the actual LGO has, but it has much more charm than an airport restaurant should! The food tastes exactly the same, the prices are the same, the service is the same and they are very fast!   I visited for breakfast and enjoyed the commuter sandwich but noticed that they have a wood-fired oven to make their well-known pizzas and they have a full menu of LGO favorites including all their breakfast, lunch and dinner offerings. They also have the cookies, baked goods and pre-made sandwiches.   LGO is located at gate D and it's worth visiting regardless of your location in Terminal Four!"}
{"text":"Got a salad to go. Not bad, kinda hard to go wrong with a salad. Maybe just the price could be a little lower"}
{"text":"This place makes such great food and the store is fun to shop in while you wait. They make their own English muffins, which are so freakin good, you'll wonder why no other bakery has ever made them."}
{"text":"Parking can be difficult at lunch time but worth the extra effort.  Wide choice of salads, sandwiches and homemade specialty breads. The Sonoma salad with mangos, goat cheese and poppy-seed dressing makes an excellent selection along with a generous freshly toasted BLT on thick whole grain bread.  Easily enough to share and eat on the patio.  Wide selection of specialty sauces and wines."}
{"text":"The croissants tasted weird. I should have went back to get my money back but didnt want to miss my flight."}
{"text":"Very friendly folks, wings are spot on, grilled to perfection, good pizza and bakery items, wanted to try English muffins, but not willing to pay 9.00 for half a dozen. I will return for gelato alone, it's amazing even though it's an hour from home. Sunday afternoon lots of parking in front, confirmed with gals ok to park there, no valets in sight. Very kid friendly, but also very tight seating"}
{"text":"Can you ever had a 5 star experience in an airport?  I'm not sure, but the food here comes darn close.  We tried a roast beef sandwich and the chickpea / roasted tomato / lettuce wrap. Both items were very flavorful.  There was a several minute wait for the roast beef sandwich, but it was worthwhile.  The chickpea lettuce wrap had really good flavor, and it was wonderful to eat something that was 1) healthy and 2) vegetarian while in an airport.  It would have been impossible to eat as a wrap without making a giant mess, but I used a fork and knife and it worked out great.  As for the ordering & dining experience... There were several registers scattered around the various counters and they were all staffed, but the throngs of people everywhere made getting to the registers a bit difficult.  I would recommend some crowd control stanchions in front of each register to organize things a bit more (think of the line guides you see at Noodles & Co) and perhaps have some printed out menus as people wait in line.   A sign that says \"Any item may be ordered at any register\" would be good too - some people were insisting on waiting by the register that was near a \"pizza\" sign simply because they thought they had to be in that line to order that item, when that wasn't true.   My other comment was that it was hard to find seating - many of the small tables had been combined to form large tables - which in an airport, isn't necessarily a bad thing - given the carry-ons, purses, coats, etc that most people are schlepping around.  We just asked a twosome sitting at a table for 8 if they minded some company.  They didn't, so it wasn't a problem at all.  A couple of other points: -the food was very reasonably priced (given that you're in an airport!) -you can get non-breakfast items in the morning.  I don't know about you, but I don't always want eggs at 10 am...especially if I've been up for 6 hours at that point; that's when I'm looking for lunch.  Le Grande Orange had a great selection of breakfast and lunch items, and all were available to be ordered at 10 am.  The food was 5 star.  The ordering experience (the day that I was there) was a 3 star experience, so it averages to 4 stars.  However, the ordering issues are small logistics problems that can be fixed easily, so I'm not worried about it and I would deal with the hassles again in order the tasty food.  At the end of the day, I will absolutely come to a Le Grande Orange when I'm looking for a good healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast in airport is typically a nasty affair.   But this has to be one of the top places to get a breakfast at an airport.  Fresh eggs to order with bacon? Fresh toast? Real fruit to accompany it?   Yes please.  Is it the best breakfast EVER? No. But it doesn't need to be. It's airport food. And quite good at that. Definitely worth seeking out when you're waiting for your flight. Well worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in any airport in the U.S.! La Grande Orange has a little bit of everything. I always make a beeline for this place, which is about 3 times a month. I am in love with their kale, quinoa salad! Their chickpea salad is also very good and extremely healthy. Their pizzas and sandwiches are also excellent choices. Their dessert options are something to admire; they offer mini ding dongs and also mini cookies for those of us that are watching our weight, but still want to indulge a little. The ingredients are always fresh and the prices are very reasonable. While there are other tasty options in PHX SkyHarbor Airport, nothing is as good as La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"So fancy and so good. Pizza, wines, notebooks, cupcakes, coffee.  Everything your yuppies heart needs.  Along with some free wi-fi, you can see why all the folks and their yoga mats were hanging out here."}
{"text":"I went here while on vacation. Beautiful cakes in the display case! Neato gift items.   Yummy  food.  I was very happy that they were able to remake my salad without cheese. I loved every bit of this place."}
{"text":"great place to eat. haven't been here in ages, mainly because the parking is so aggravating. not many places can you go where people sit for extended periods of time in their running vehicle waiting for a spot...or honk their horn....or look at you with loathe when you take an extra 30 seconds to put on your seatbelt/take down the sunshade...  what hasn't been said about this uber popular local establishment? the food is great. my veggie sandwich was thick on veggies and came with a large slice of watermelon. coffee is on the high side, but you can refill it as many times as you want. and they have stevia!  the pizza's smelled delicious and all the salads look super healthy. prices are average and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"eww....delicious burrito......until i pulled a 12 inch long black hair from it! gross. and couldnt return it because we were already at another gate. normally super tasty burrito but not today."}
{"text":"I love LGO so much! Seriously the best cold brew coffee I have ever had! It's so incredibly smooth and rich and it's not watered down like a lot of other cold brews out there! If you enjoy cold brews or just like coffee in general then you need to go to LGO right after reading this for that cold brew coffee. Their desserts are so delicious as well. Everything I've tried has been amazing by my favorite dessert by far is the camelback trail bar. It has the perfect balance of sweet and savory and it's definitely in my top 5 favorite desserts.   I just really love LGO overall for so many different reasons but the cold brew and the camelback trail bar is a must have every time I come!"}
{"text":"For the past four years, I have been visiting LGO on a regular basis.  I've met groups of friends there, went there for the occasional date, enjoyed catching up with a long-lost friend, or even had plenty of study sessions there.  LGO is simply a place you can go to with anyone for any reason.    While the parking initially seemed to be a hassle for me as there are very limited spaces in the parking lot on the east side (front) of LGO, I later learned that there is available complimentary valet parking on the west side (back).  Readers of this review should realize that should there not be parking on the front, rest assured that valet is the way to go!    The grocery has some of the most fun and random items that are great for any special occasion.  The food itself is very good whether it be the breakfast specials, sandwiches, desserts, pizzeria, or coffee.  By getting on their e-mail list, you're also sent a gift certificate to use for your birthday each year."}
{"text":"Cute store! Reminds me of the awesome little french bakeries in NYC. Part knick knack store, part breakfast/sweets. I bought an item off the sale/day old rack and it was quite good."}
{"text":"This is always a highlight of my business trips to Phoenix.  There is a location in PHX in the Southwest terminal but it just does not compare.  Every time I come here the parking lot is full and the staff is slammed.  The couple in front of me literally ordered $300+ worth of food/wine to be delivered when this isn't a 5-star restaurant.    I always manage to find so many things to buy in their small ecclectic shopping area....cute stationary, luggage tags, scarves, Voluspa candles...the list could go on.    Everything is freshly made and there are many vegetarian options.  Plus the desserts are abound...I couldn't choose just one yesterday so I bought two!  Campfire brownie (think S'more on top of a darkish chocolate brownie) & old fashioned chocolate pudding with whipped cream and chocolate chips.  You'd think my pudding was my entree as I gorged myself to the point of rolling out of the place."}
{"text":"Gotta try this place, the food is great and you feel at home. They have a shop and the best candles, so great for your home. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"More miss than hit...  Coconut cupcake: 0/5 Horrible. cake part has no flavor, icing on top tastes like 95% butter and 5% cream cheese... YUCK!   Blackberry & Almond Dumpling: 1/5 The flavor of the 10% that had any blackberry and almond (which as only on the very bottom) was perfect... but that left 90% of the pastry that was simply bread with no flavor.  Strawberry Crostada: 1/5 took one bite, stopped there. tasked bad  Apple Crostada: 3/5 Very good flavor, needs 2x the apples in it to make it enjoyable  Blueberry Crostada: 5/5 FINALLY something I thought was worth buying, and I enjoyed it!  I could taste blueberry the whole time and there were enough actual blueberries!"}
{"text":"After years of being told I need to try this place I finally did.  I gotta say I was turned off before I even walked in the door.   The food was delicious and the music selection was good.  This was however overshadowed by the fact that I couldn't figure out what the hell to do after ordering my food and waiting for my coffee.  This place was SO PACKED it was impossible for my brunch mate and I to have a relaxing conversation.  It was too much.  After getting our food we had to carry it through crowds of people to find a place to sit.    On top of that the \"grocery\" was unimpressive.  I don't really understand what makes this place a \"grocery.\"  It looked as if they had taken items from all the cute little downtown Phoenix boutiques I've been seeing for years and crammed them into a small overcrowded space along with wine, cupcakes, and brunch.   This place is as trendy as hiking Camelback Mountain. I felt the majority of the customers and staff were pretentious snobs.  Not all of course, there was one fellow customer who helped me clean up my mess after I spilled my coffee and there was \"one\" staff member who was friendly-the rest seemed to be annoyed and short on patience (I would be too if I worked there). I prefer many Downtown/Central Phoenix brunch spots to this where I can actually sit and wait for my food to be delivered to me while having a pleasant conversation with a friend without having to feel that I'm being rushed out of there."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! It's always packed and has so many menu items to choose from. I love that you can shop a little bit while you're waiting in line or waiting for your food. We got chicken salad and a blondie, which were both very good! I do think they should advertise their additional parking a little better, though. We were about to go somewhere else because parking was such a nightmare and only found the extra parking lot on accident!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited LGO a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal. The WINGS were by far the best I have ever tasted. Our pizza was great, we had the pepperoni and ricotta. It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didn't buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO."}
{"text":"LGO is always popular!  Especially a good place for brunch, grabbing a salad for lunch, or grabbing coffee/tea and a treat!  The sea salt French brownie is incredible, and you can't go wrong with a classic Arnold Palmer.  Browse the random knick knacks while you wait for your food or drink, some fun local things, like MAME candles are mixed in.  Parking and finding seating is a pain, especially on the weekend at peak hours, try to go off peak if possible."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I'm already a fan. Didn't get a chance to meander through the shop, but honestly, I wasn't there to shop.   We parked in the back and basically walked through the kitchen (which is in the shop) and the shop to get to the pizza place. There are far too many entrances. We had to walk through 3 doors, and then walk to the other end of the restaurant, just so the hostess could see us, and walk us back the way we came to seat us at a table. Kind of felt like I was walking in circles. Not so good if you go hungry. But all that can be overlooked because the food is fantastic!  We got the avocado pizza and added prosciutto and spicy chilies. Now, let me preface this with the fact that I'm not really a pizza person, unless i make it myself. Generally the crust is just blah and there's too much sauce. I am now a LGO pizza person! the pizza was just big enough for the two of us, the crust was thin, hand-made and perfect. The toppings were fresh, and you could tell. I didn't have a problem with the topping ratio, either. Usually I find that there's too much of one thing, not enough of another, but this was not the case. Avocado, 4 cheeses, prosciutto, tomatoes, spinach and chillies. No red sauce. Right off the bat, that made me happy. The flavours were perfect, the crust was perfect, it was pretty much a perfect pizza.   One issue I had with the meal: no refills on sodas. They give you a can, a short glass and 2 (yes, really) ice cubes. Kind of a let down. Stick with iced tea, or remember to ask for a large glass with ice.   Dessert. it was my birthday dinner, so of course dessert was a must. Our friends (who got the same pizza as we did, sans chillies) got the million layer red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. I got what they call the Old Timer, which is essentially a homemade Hostess cupcake.... on crack! I'm a fan of red velvet cake, but i'm super picky about it. This was moist and perfectly done, and the frosting was finger-licking good. My Old Timer was just ridiculous. Cream filled devils food cake with chocolate ganache all around the outside. The cake was perfect; moist but not mushy, the ganache was rich but not so rich you couldn't eat it and the cream was fresh.   I can't wait to go back for a date night and try an appetiser, maybe a different pizza and a different dessert. I'd love to go for brunch, try a pastry, mosey around the store..."}
{"text":"We were headed back to Pizzeria Bianco & saw this place on Yelp as another option too. We didn't have a chance to visit the actual restaurant of either when we were in Phoenix so when we were at the airport & saw this place we were so excited!   It was so delicious!!!! We got the fallen angel and the sonoma salad and they were both amazing. Definitely not cheap but to get gourmet food at the airport was totally worth it versus same price at some other place!  Crust, toppings and cheese were amazing! The salad was fresh and had a great mix of ingredients!  We will be back for sure to this or the main location!"}
{"text":"The smoked salmon commuter sandwich is outstanding. I look forward to eating here every time I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This appears to be a very popular place. They were very busy. Their food was delicious. I had their shredded kale and quinoa salad. Their service was fast and friendly. The salads are premade and available from a refrigerator case but fresh. Sandwiches and other items are made to order. Customers order at a counter. When selections are ready, there is a large dining area for those choosing to eat in. They have a beverage bar where customers can order specialty drinks. I had a cold brewed, ice coffee. Although I only had a salad, I saw many people eating breakfast items and sandwiches that looked very good. The breakfast selections involving English muffins use the real thing, muffins from England.  The one negative is the parking. One day there was a line of cars backed into the street. The dining area is too big for their parking area. However, there are several nearby locations for overflow parking. If I lived in the area, I suspect that I would frequently visit the LGO."}
{"text":"I piss on this place.  Not because the food isn't great - it is. Not because the coffee's bad - it isn't. It sucks compared to coffee in Australia but then only Italy does coffee like Australia.  No, I piss on this place because it embodies all that is wrong and twisted with the American Dream.  Why 4 stars then? Because, well my friends, this is the best food and coffee in a wide area around \"Arcadia,\" in Phoenix. \"Arcadia,\" the neighborhood this mecca-of-breast-implants is in, is actually just \"Phoenix,\" and was quite the lower-middle-class HELL HOLE just a decade or so ago. (Has it been even longer now?)  Some real estate whore must have come up with the name so collagen-lipped medusas from LA would pay $750,000 to $1,000,000 for places that were only worth about $80. By the time you read this the nearby real estate price range may be more like $1.5 M to $2 M.  So, come here for the excellent (yes) food and pretty good coffee if you must. The food really is great. Their breakfast menu ranges from the best bacon & eggs with euro-dainties to awesome burgers & pizza at lunch and dinner. There are great vegetarian options, sandwiches, etc., all done with a Euro flair. Ingredients are top quality. Basically, all the food is pretty amazing. Whatever.  But - your sense of common decency will be continuously assaulted by the gold-Rolex con Gucci crowd that infests this signpost for the death of Arizona as we knew it. Facelifts, tacky Ralph Lauren Polo everything, sockless Bally loafers, hair extensions, wealthy foreigners and worst of all: People from New York (me) and LA (also me, in the past!)  Everything that has gone wrong with America is on display here from morning until night, day after day, night after night. Endless parades of gorgeous nubiles flaunting their latest \"Yoga\" wear and the over-tanned 40-50 somethings who court them from this restaurant directly to the latest plastic surgeon.   Friendly staff and a bit pricey. Parking is a BEYATCH and they actually have valet parking to move your car 10 feet from where you drive up.   Always packed with the beautiful people, if you're looking for that, FYI.   Wear that fake Rolex you got on Canal Street, Bitches!"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  Came for brunch, lines out the door as we anticipated.  No big deal, as it moved quickly.  I ordered eggs and bacon and hubby the pancakes. Unfortunately by the time it got to the table everything was stone cold.  Coffee was really strong (end of the batch??) then when we went for a second cup they were out and had to wait ten minutes for a fresh brew.  Not the best experience, shame I really wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I had the margarita pizza and really enjoyed it.  My wife had the cheese pizza. For her that bottom was a little burnt. This is a problem with these stone baked pizzas from time to time.   The setup of this place in the airport had its high points and low points. Trying to get in a get food from the 3 different areas (burgers, bakery, pizza) in the place was odd even when there were few people. The tables were nice though. There are tables that have plug-ins for your devices.   I would certainly go here again if I am in the Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday around 12:30pm.  Was packed, which I expected from the great things I have heard of this place...but this was insane.  Had to valet park next door at Postinos, and there almost wasn't enough room.  Had gazpacho and grilled cheese- was very good.  The shop inside has super cute, though slightly expensive gifty items  as well as food items.  The place is bigger than it looks. I will try to go at a less busy time next time and get a better feel for the place."}
{"text":"Scotty hands down is the best pizza maker. I'm a pizza nut that can eat pizza every day, but good pizza. I'm love the Rocketman it has veggies and the way Cory makes is unreal - LGO is my favorite PIzza - there are some great other places but I keep coming back to LGO"}
{"text":"This place is pure heaven!  It is a combo restaurant (wait-staff for dinner, casual for breakfast and lunch), market, coffee shop, gelateria, wine shop, bakery . . . basically all things good!  They have an amazing fig pizza, delicious looking sushi, and one of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted (it's called the \"Better\" cookie, with oatmeal, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate).  The music is fun and hip.  The market features gourmet goodies, kitchen accessories, magazines, wine and wine stuff, even toys for kids and pets.  As a San Franciscan, I have high expectations when it comes to food places.  Le Grande Orange surpasses them 10 fold.  I am so happy to have found it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. White sangria is very refreshing too! Excellent service and atmosphere in the bar area."}
{"text":"I did not know there was a La Grande Orange location in the airport until last week! I had never been there before, but always wanted to try. I love that there is so much variety, so many healthy options, and so many vegetarian options! The pizza sounded pretty great, I'll have to try it sometime, but I wasn't super hungry so I went for a salad. I got the Kale Quinoa Salad without cheese, and it was very good. Sometimes kale has an odd taste, or the taste is just overpowering, but I really enjoyed it in this salad. It also came with a lemon vinegarette which was also good. My sister and mom split a burger and chicken ceasar salad, and they both really enjoyed their food as well. Their only complaint was that they did not like one of the dressings, luckily they had it on the side. For dessert we tried an array of cookies! The chocolate chip sea salt was good, but there was too much salt on them. The butterscotch oat cookies were probably my favorite, I love butterscotch. We also tried the A to Z cookie, which was okay, and the peanut butter cookie, which was much better than we had expected it to be! Next time I'm hungry and in terminal D, I will be making a return. Also hope to check out the original La Grande Orange location in the near future!"}
{"text":"Parking is horrible, but the place is charming.  I love the ecclectic mix of gifts (books, soaps, candles, candies and stuffed animals) along with food products and wine.  The prices are high.  You are paying for the charm and the convenience of being in Arcardia.  I will say however this is often were I come for my dessert fix.  They carry tammie coe cupcakes which are sweet and delicious.  I always pop in when i'm grabbing a pizza, over at Postinos or jonesing for some gelato next door.  Great place to grab some coffee or a quick breakfast on the weekend.  Real neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"I've been to La Grande Orange a few times and adore the venue, grocery and store. However, I have been less than impressed with the food. The first time I went for breakfast and had the Jersey Girl Omelet. It was good but not great. The next timeI had the mushroom pizza. It was so greasy that I had to go through multiple napkins and could only eat 1-2 small pieces before I gave it all to my friends.  To sum it up, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out, people watch and do some small gift shopping it is a great place but don't do there for the food."}
{"text":"LGO is a classic place to get a quick bite that's going to be quality.  Here are my favorites:  -Iced Coffee -poached eggs and english muffins -any of the salads, burgers or pizzas/wings  The Reuben sandwich is great too!"}
{"text":"Great place! (Even if it wasn't in an airport)  Will definitely stop by again if I fly thru PHX."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how busy this place was for Monday at 10 am.!  This was my second time eating here and both times the food and service have been terrific. I went here with my sister and nephews. I usually don't go out to eat with kids but this place was great for kids because of the sitting area outside. I had the commuter sandwich with smoked salmon and it was amazing! The homemade english muffin is what made the sandwich. My sister had mia's french pancakes. I tried a bite and they were also very tasty. This place can get really hectic and yes the parking sucks but the people who work here are unbelievably nice and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"LGO is my second home. I go 1,2, and sometimes 3 or 4 times in one day. Everyone their from liana and Ashley at the coffee bar to Ali in the retail portion all remember my name and what I get. Just recently I was on vacation for a week and my first stop when I got home was LGO. Everyone working commented on how it had been so long since they'd seen me and asked where i had gone. This is truly a one of kind place whether I'm their for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, gelato, or a trinket, card, or candle I know it will be the best. As long as I live in Arizona I won't move within more than 5 minutes of this place and who knows what sort of withdrawals I would have if I ever left the state! If you live in Arizona and haven't been get out from under your rock and if you're visiting it's a must go."}
{"text":"Hot spot. Hotspot. H o t s p o t. You will love it. Don't think about it, just go! You will love the fun hidden secret vibe of this place. I call this a phx best !!"}
{"text":"Worst espresso I've had in years. Ordered a double, and it barely cornered the bottom of the cup. Very, very bitter.   Purchased a kale salad to take on the flight; it was tasty and nutritious."}
{"text":"I went here on a morning with my wife and kids.  We left a large resort and were on our way out of town headed to the Grand Canyon.  Perhaps the service leaves something to be desired because it is a grocery that has a kitchen, but the food is out of this world.  My daughter was disappointed in the pancakes because they were more like crapes, but I loved them and my older kids loved it all.  It did not matter since she ate half of my wife's egg white omelet.  We all shared and I would go back every week if I could.  Certainly all the locals seem to be doing that."}
{"text":"Disappointed.. ordered. a burger.. seemed over cooked for med well and bun was stale and dry."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery is always good to me. I love the baked goods especially the old timer cupcake and slice of red velvet cake! I have yet to have anything here that doesn't make my taste buds sing. The folks that prepare food at La Grande Orange are consistently putting out great food. Breakfast, lunch and dinner it doesn't matter, the rich coffee drinks and commuter sandwich and in the morning on their homemade English muffins.    The beautiful salads and scrumptious sandwiches for lunch and for dinner their delicious pizzas and burgers and don't forget their perfect sangria that will sneak up on you by the second glass; you win with whatever you choose. I have learned going early or around 5pm I don't have too much trouble with parking and when the front lot is full then their is always the valet option. , When I want great food LGO is the place I go! Ooh and don't forget to save room for the gelato"}
{"text":"Great staff, great store and great desserts. My wife and daughter had no problems finding stuff to buy here while we waited for our pizzas being made next door. Both gals found little gifts and my wife mentioned this store being a great place for finding gifts for others. Now for me, I bought three desserts (red velvet cake, nutty bar, and old timer) for later and all were good. Red velvet was probably the favorite but all were yummy."}
{"text":"I LOVE stopping by LGO in the morning for coffee on the way to work. This is a charming little place where you can pick up coffee, or a good fresh breakfast. They also have great sandwiches and salads. And did I mention gelatto?  My favorite though HAS to be the French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookies. Sweet and savoury and just a little buttery all at the same time. There's only one other thing that can make my eyes roll back in my head they're THAT good! I now pop in here and pick up a dozen for any party because everyone LOVES them.   You can also pick up a nice bottle of wine, some artisan cheese or bread and some interesting knick knacks not at all related to food. Think of it as part high end market/deli/cafe/wine shop/bakery/coffee shop/etc.  The only thing that sucks is the parking but the valet guys can usually work something out for you."}
{"text":"the food here is deeee-licious. i like the decor, the ambiance, the menu, the waitstaff. however, i hate the feeling that i'm being some trendy little scottsdale frou-frou by eating here.  the salads are totally inventive and yummy, but a little on the sweet side. i loooooooooooove that you can add an egg (genius!!!) and fresh garlic to your pizza. i adore the fresh and homemade ingredients, and i really like the cute little neighborhood-eatery feel. eating here makes me feel as if i'm in a bigger city than phx.   LGO is on the pricey side, and definitely caters to those who want to eat gourmet/designer pizza. however, taste wins out with all the fantastic and fresh toppings. and if you ever get sick of franchise restaurants a la CPK, LGO is a great alternative."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing! I usually grab a bite here when I pass through the Phoenix airport because they offer healthy good food choices. The last time I was passing through, I didn't think I'd have time. I asked at the air carrier desk and was told boarding was delayed by 40 minutes so I went and placed an order. While waiting, they started boarding my flight (air carrier was mixed up and referenced wrong flight), so when I asked how quick it would be ready, Ski (?) told me just to board and they'd deliver my food. Found this hard to believe as they were very busy, but I trusted him. Before the plane closed the door, the flight attendant came to me with a bag from La Grande Orange withy meal - a veggie panini sandwich that was delicious! I think they need to start promoting that service of meal delivery on the runway. It was an awesome experience and so impressed with Ski's degree of customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's probably the best thing that has happened to an airport. Just imagine a great place for food, not expensive, and inside an airport... Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.  There's already an LGO \"intersection\" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.  I love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!  The food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery, known as simply LGO to locals and its coffee shop set up is simply on point. It's a bit boutique-ish but the food and coffee doesn't lie, they serve good stuff, as well as having a solid selection of cheese and wine. If you're from out of town, eat at any of the LGO spots (the pizza place next door, or Ingo's across the way...) you will know why it's buzzin' with local Phoenicians.  Why go there: The coffees are incredibly well done, they are served at a good temperature and the baristas are not shy of suggesting some of their latest, fun creations. You can also grab a quick pre-packed salad, baked good, some locally made house wine and imported cheeses.  Look at the kitchen back there, things are rockin' behind that open kitchen... good, local goodies are made here with love.  Don't miss: The breakfast goods and a well crafted coffees."}
{"text":"I've been going here since before I moved to Arizona 5 years ago. The food is so high quality and fresh, it's continued to be one of my favorite places in the valley. I just so happen to work right down the street now, so I probably go here a good 1-2 times a week minimum.  My favorite has to be the Ahi tuna sandwhich. It's cooked perfect everytime. I swap out the aolil for some champagne viniagarette and add avocado. Amazing! The baked goods are dangerously good, I'm trying to diet so I won't think too long about them. I recommend this place to everyone I know and they all come back and thank me."}
{"text":"Sat in bar area while waiting for another guest.  Took a while for staff to come to us in bar.  Great food though!  Lots of interesting items in the store as well"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get a Havana Latte and any one of their pizzas.    You can thank me later."}
{"text":"$14.25 Pepporoni Pizza was not made to order (kept warm by a heat lamp). High hopes for this place as it is one of the best yelp reviewed but was super disappointed when cashier went and grabbed it off the heat lamp table. Pizza would have been fabulous if it was fresh.  The layout, seating and cleanliness of the place was amazing though"}
{"text":"Yesterday I purchased a \"brownie\" from the cafe. It was not described any other way but simply \"brownie\". It was the most un-enjoyable brownie I've ever had.   It's kind of dry and chewy, with a strong alcohol flavor that's not matched well with whatever chocolate they use. They also top it with salt, and the brownie is not sweet enough to counter the salt flavor. So what you basically end up with is an offensive bitter square with a boozy salty flavor. It's not yummy and I would trash the recipe and start over.   If I could get my money back I would."}
{"text":"If your a tourist this is a great local place to grab breakfast or lunch at. They offer very affordable options that are very good and have a decent variety.  -The pancakes are the thin kind, very delicious with a cream topping with strawberry. -I love you Brooklyn salmon bagel is with scrambled egg, a nice touch to a classic. -The dessert bar is awesome, loved the cheese cake and macaroons.  This place is a sure fire bet for a great meal."}
{"text":"DESSERTS ARE AMAZING! I have gotten addicted to Tammy Co cupcakes thanks to LGO! I keep coming back! Knowing that their staff is going to greet me with a smile and always ready to aid me and answer my questions is another reason I keep coming back.   You ABSOLUTELY HAVE to try their Tammy Co red velvet cupcakes. They are to DIE for!  You will find yourself day dreaming about them. Their other desserts have also been tasty and their cakes so cute, crafty and UNIQUE! If you're looking for an artsy cake in a unique design THIS IS YOUR PLACE!  Its always fun wandering around and finding random little nick nacks for yourself, friends and family!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food is pretty good; service is awful. The first time I was there it was very crowded. I was just getting a pre-made salad and a drink and apparently was in the \"wrong\" line. After waiting my turn and finally getting to the cashier, she rudely told me I was in the wrong line and wouldn't ring me up. SORRY. Did not know that, being my first time.   I had a similar experience with snotty cashiers the 2nd time I went. It's always over-crowded but I guess the yuppie a-holes love this place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The LGO grocery is so cool, they have really neat and eclectic gifts and specialty items. I like to hop over here after enjoying a pizza to browse all of their fun items!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is so great! They have a delicious vegan pizza that can also be made gluten-free, which satisfied my gluten-free and dairy-free diet. Also, their salads are fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic. Omg. We had the rocket man along with a few other pizzas for the kiddos and I didn't expect greatness.... But greatness it was.  I wish we had this place where I live so I can have the pizza again!!   The shop attached to the restaurant is awesome. So much fun to look thru and so much to want to buy.  The cookies were soooo big and the cake we got was so tasty.   My only boo about this place was that it was super loud music. :/"}
{"text":"This is a fun place, although it's usually pretty crowded parking can be difficult overall this is a fun place to visit and check out."}
{"text":"Seeing that my last review was in December 2007, I figure it's about time that I write a quick update!  I'm still a huge fan of LGO... as a matter of fact, I'm still a regular!  Mostly I go for breakfast and lunch.  I've never been disappointed with my order there.  My latest favorite item is the commuter sandwich on a whole wheat tortilla.  I get it with egg whites and avocado and it is delicious!  I love the iced tea, and I also love the fun retail items on sale at LGO.    It's best to go during non-prime hours so you don't have to fight the crowds or the parking situation...  I am a forever fan of LGO - I cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"LGO at the airport? Yes please!  I'd heard that LGO had an airport location, but due to the fact that I typically fly US Airways, I never had an opportunity to visit... that is - until yesterday!  I flew Southwest back from New Orleans and to my pleasant surprise, LGO was located right next to the gate that I exited from.  I was so excited to see it, and so impressed with the appearance, that I ended up grabbing a bite and sitting down to eat and do some work rather than rushing home like I usually do!  They did a great job duplicating LGO in it's airport location.  The menu surprisingly offers *almost* everything that the original location at 40th Street and Campbell offers.  (I believe they are just missing the sushi.)  The airport has an LGO Bakeshop... don't miss the butterscotch oatmeal and chocolate chip with sea salt cookies!  And they have a Grateful Spoon gelato area too...  friendly service to boot!  After eating my way through Nola, I passed on dessert this time around, but I went for the Thai Chicken Salad and it tasted just as great as it usually does; I guess they didn't compromise on quality at all!  Now that I know this location exists, I may have to head to the airport a little earlier from now on... cheers to great local options at PHX for travelers!"}
{"text":"A must do when in PHX.   LGO has great pre- made salads and on the go food in addition to tasty desserts as well.   I definitely suggest ordering an Arnold Palmer if you're there and definitely take a peak around if you have some time and extra $$ for gifts.   My goto's here include - the turkey sandwich on a wrap as well as any of their salads!   If you're in a rush, you can order to go and pick up your food in one of their pick up parking spots as well.   This is also a great place for dinner with family and kids. Tons of options, lots of bacon and amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Busy nice airport food.  Nice to be able to get a healthy meal in an airport and if after hours a glass of wine too boot!  I had the Kale salad which tasted pretty good, a shot of espresso (pick me up) and a sandwich all worked out well.  The only problem is the wait and getting seated.  If you have a group more than 4 probably not worth it."}
{"text":"Interesting little place here! We didn't try any of the pizzas or salad but the coffee was really good and the deserts were awesome I don't like chocolate chip cookies but I was tempted... Their salted chocolate chip cookies were outstanding.  Possibly the best chocolate chip cookie on the planet??"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here on my whirlwind visit to Phoenix, crowning LGO as serving the best ice cream in the city. While I cannot vouch for best (not having tried any others), the mint chocolate chip ice cream is THE BEST mint ice cream I have ever tasted.  This rendition is REALLY minty, with actual bites of mint leaves, with big chunks of chocolate embedded in the ice cream. It is so refreshing and hits the spot after a hot day."}
{"text":"I ordered a rotisserie chicken sandwich to go last night and was very disappointed. It should have been called \"chicken parts, gristle and rubbery skin\" sandwich. I threw it out and went to subway. Not what I expected from La Grande Orange. Do better!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the convenient order and pick up parking -- although I hate their parking lot. Their kale and quinoa salad is probably my favorite salad ever. Their iced tea is the best. I drink a lot of black iced tea and theirs is hands down my favorite. Their new salted iced tea latte is a fantastic afternoon pick me up. The gluten free cookie is one of the best cookies I have ever had - put it in the ring against any cookie gluten free or not and its coming out on top. And of course their sea salt chocolate chip cookie is great too. They have amazing English muffins, the commuter breakfast sandwich with avocado is so good! In short, never had a bad thing there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekend hangout spots! The mood is just right.  It's a hip and trendy place with a touch of spirituality and wellness vibe. Whether you are looking to chill with your Kindle or relax with a cup of latte by yourself or with a crowd, this place is set up just perfect for individuals and groups. They have limited parking in their small lot considering how crowded this place can get, but you can park a block away and walk over. Both times I've been here I haven't had any issues luckily and always at the front of the line when I arrive. But I've been told by regulars of the parking situation.   Great music, ambience is just perfect (lively, great dark flooring), high quality merchandise/ products with better ingredients than most places and well packaged, even their branded bags are well made and designed, cute knick knacks! Their staff is friendly.  My cashier didn't rush me at all and offered up great suggestions my second time here.   I ordered one of their sandwiches the first time I was here after my hike at Camelback mountain. It's close by and great stop on the way back from the hike. They have a great selection of teas. I hear their berry hibiscus tea is great. Their pizza is amazing! My friend says their sourdough crust is to die for! Had a half and half. One side Margherita pizza with goat cheese and the other was like a meat lovers with sausage and cashew cheese. Finished the entire thing by myself. The crust is thin just the way I like it. After you order your food wait near by to the left of the register where your food gets called out for you to pick up. They have some clearly labeled signs. Chalkboard can be hard to read but they have a printed menu by the register in case you are nearsighted like me. Will definitely be back here. So worth the drive.   They have a coffee stand inside to the left side. On my to try list."}
{"text":"Ate at La Grande Orange at the Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and was completely impressed.  For an airport cafe the food was \"real\", delicious and well prepared.  The service was very quick and the staff was pleasant and efficient. I asked for a different variation on the sandwich I ordered and they had no problem making the change.   I couldn't have had a better experience---and at an airport that makes it even more impressive."}
{"text":"I can always count on LGO for a great meal. The pizzeria is great, but this time I opted for the brown rice bowl. Since I can't have enough greens I also ordered a kale salad (heavy kale) to mix in a few more greens into my bowl. :) the bowl is LGO's take on the Korean dish, Bibimbap.... need I say more than awesome flavors. This version has brown rice, quinoa, saut√©ed greens, black beans, sprinkled feta and pistachios with a side of harissa. Fantastic dish with delicious flavors, very filling and vegetarian friendly. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The Caesar was perfect, crispy croutons and a creamy and delicious dressing with awesome cheese. The wings have a great smoky flavor and just enough heat and are paired with an amazing blue cheese, pretty pungent but delish! The pizza has a nice pull to it and the meats, cheese, and sauce have the best flavors! The valet parking makes it easy and the service is top notch. The dessert, next door, is plentiful and delicious! The old fashion is my favorite but this time I had the chocolate hazelnut cake, very very rich."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for 2 weeks and this was not only the worst meal, but all around experience.  The \"self serve\" parking lot is minuscule and if you can't find a spot there (you won't) then you go around back where there are many parking spaces, however, they are blocked by cones. Because they are reserved for the Valet service, which is about as necessary as wearing a bathing suit in Antartica. If I am expected to order my meal at the counter, pick it up and bring it to an empty table, how am I not capable of parking my car?  My car was about 10 feet from the Valet stand as I waited for my car all I could think about was how below average the meal was. And how I wish I calculated the 5 minute valet wait into my drive back to the hotel.  I mean seriously, I could have crawled to my car from the store exit.  I'm not at a world class steak house, let me handle parking my car in one of the many openings right next to the building.   The ordering experience might be worse.  Might be.  The line builds up right near the prepared meals refrigerator so it's a cluster trying to figure out whose in line and whose looking at possible salad choices. It's a maze trying to navigate your way through the store since the layout resembles your grandmas garage sale that she has every 10 years, so yeah there is crap everywhere (understatement). I guess if you want a mediocre lunch, a stuffed animal, a key chain and want to feel high class with Valet service then this place may be for you."}
{"text":"We were nervous bringing a group since they don't take reservations, but had no problem on a Monday night. The tall community table was perfect for our group of 8. While other places frown upon holding seats (ahem, B&T), the waitstaff immediately put out water glasses to hold places until the rest of our friends arrived. Cocktails at happy hour are a smoking deal! $5 for a fabulous Greenpoint- generous pour, nice glass, single big cube. Our server had the kitchen split the yummy salad that B and I shared onto two plates (nice touch!). We also shared the \"Mother Earth\" pizza. Good amount of veggie toppings, but needed a little salt and spice for me. Our server was really amazing. She explained the HH deals multiple times, helped us get in one more round before it ended, and then split a very complicated itemized bill between 4 parties. She went above and beyond! Parking is limited, but the complimentary valet is speedy."}
{"text":"I still really love coming to LGO...especially to relax on their patio with some good food and good drink. I love that LGO sells Framboise and I love the hectic and busy atmosphere.   HOWEVER, the time has come for me to drop a star. I am a regular fixture at LGO and lately have noticed that they seem to be running out of some of my favorite items on a regular basis. For example, the MJ Cookie...it is one of the few items that makes my mouth water at just the thought of it. It's like a brownie and cookie rolled into one. So heavenly. Unfortunately, LGO has been out of the MJ Cookie 4 out of my last 5 visits. And these visits are at all different times of the day/week. I know they get busy and I know a restaurant can run out, but it seems to happen so frequently and every time it's a big, BIG let down. And sadly, the cookie is not the only item that they run out of regularly. Lately, I've had a hard time finding the pre-made salads that I like too.  My other issue just occurred and I cannot seem to pull myself out of the depression that it has caused. They no longer serve the green chile mac and cheese! Seriously. When I stopped in recently for lunch, I was so disappointed that this has been removed from the menu that I thought about walking out. I know that seems like a silly reaction to macaroni and cheese, but their green chile mac and cheese was by far one of the best items I found on their menu.   Their sandwiches are tasty, but almost impossible to hold together. Their pizzas have great fresh ingredients, but always seem to be lacking something. And now this...no more mac and cheese. And they're always out of MJ cookies! It is a sad sad day at LGO. =("}
{"text":"LGO is a great, feel good place to spend an afternoon.  I've never brought someone who didn't find something to like about this place!    A tip: Pull into the Postino's parking lot & valet your car!  It is free (with gratuity, of course) and much easier than trying to find parking in the front.  Then, you can walk around to the front of the store or cut through the back entrance.  There are some small tables in the grocery store portion as well as plenty of tables in the restaurant portion.  During the day, you order in the grocery store, find a table, and wait for your food to be served.  In the evenings, you are seated in the restaurant portion and have a server to help with the ordering.  There isn't much I don't like about this place.  There are cute trinkets to look at while you are waiting for your food (or if you want to hang around after).  There is a dog-friendly patio out back.  All of the food is pretty much stellar - this is NOT going to be the MOST amazing meal of your life, but its pretty darn good for brunch.  Their pizzas are some of my favorite in the valley!  I highly recommend!  You can also pick out beer or bottles of wine from the grocery store to accompany your meal.    Note: There is an LGO at the airport as well - this is my MOST frequented airport meal because it is AWESOME for airport food.  As a vegetarian with many meat-eating family/friends, this place has a great selection for all types of eaters!"}
{"text":"I first used La Grande Orange to provide sandwiches for a meeting I was organizing in that area so it worked out. At first I kind of balked art the price but then when they found out it was for a non-profit, boom - got a nice discount!  I've been eating sandwiches there ever since. Great location especially if you live in the Arcadia district which is where I'm planning to move soon.  PS - MMMMMMM...Green Chile Burger........"}
{"text":"I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.  I need to come back and get the pizza!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread, beer, wine and cheeses.  i was very impressed with the quality of their food, espresso and cleanliness of their store.  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat.  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts, cards and books and other unique stuff.   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices, this place is very hard to beat.  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is my second home. You will find me here most weeekdays with my laptop enjoying the free WIFI and some yummy food. This place tends to confuse people, so here is the deal. La Grande Orange is owned by the ever so easy on the eyes Craig DeMarco. He also owns Postino Wine Cafe (2 locations), La Grande Orange Pizzeria and Radio Milano in the valley in addition to a few in California.  First of all the Grocery or LGO is not really a Grocery. It is a self-serve restaurant featuring Breakfast and Lunch all day. In addition they sell lots of Wine, Specialty Grocery items and lots of stuff you never knew you needed. Once you get your food you may sit outside or at the few inside tables or you may also sit in the Pizzeria side till 4pm. This is where it gets fuzzy. On Fridays you can also order Pizza in the Grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the Pizzeria until 4pm. At 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. Confusing to newbies, but it works.   This place is full of regulars. Mostly business types, Self Employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. They have WIFI and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. It is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill. My only beef is they don't serve Breakfast Alcoholic drinks like Bloody Marys or Mimosas, but I would never leave if they did, so all is well, Try their Havana Latte, Croque Madame, San Danielle Special Sandwich, any Salad... You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Another great lunch picked up curbside from 2of LGO's best, Ashley and Emily!! Thanks girls!!"}
{"text":"After a flight from Seattle, we had about 2 hours until our flight to El Paso, so we grabbed some food at La Grande Orange.  My wife, who had dined here before, had a tuna salad sandwich which she said was delicious.  I had the Cubano which was equally tasty.  When we have a stop in Phoenix, I know where there is some good food."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  I had the chickpea lettuce wraps, huge and awesome, plus better yet the kale & quinoa salad.  That is to die for.  I am in airports multiple times a week this place is the best."}
{"text":"Was in Terminal 4 and only had limited time to pick something up for dinner to munch on the plane, and after wondering around trying to figure out what I wanted (Yes terminal 4 has plenty to choose from, but also once you past the security check ins, go check out the other gates, they too have plenty to choose from as well) I saw that La Grande Orange was in my area, now I have been wanting to try them for a while now, so I thought this must be a sign to try them out now!  I ordered this Thai Princess Chicken Salad (not sure if that is the correct name, but remembered that it does have the word Princess in it) that had mixed greens, red onions, cilantro (my fav ingredient in the world) spicy peanut dressing/sauce, tender diced/sliced chicken breast, diced red peppers. OMG this salad was amazing! Loved it! Wanted more!  Can't wait to try La Grande Orange in the valley now!"}
{"text":"LGO was the place that was picked for August's Breakfast Club UYE, on paper it sounded like a great idea, but the reality, not so much. Thank you everyone to attended though and went with the flow!!!  LGO is not the place to go with a huge group for breakfast.   Now with that said, I love LGO, I am a FAN of this place!! When I knew that we were going to LGO I knew right away I wanted a breakfast sandwich on one of those amazing English muffins! And that's exactly what I got it.  It had egg, bacon!!!!, cheese, tomato, avocado all mushed between 2 soft pillows of the English muffin. It was as amazing as I had thought it to be!! Loved it! I also got a side of potatoes, I am an Irish girl and love me some spuds! The potatoes where not the best I have had, nor where they the worst, I think next time I will just skip them.  Glad to have tried LGO out for breakfast and their amazing breakfast sandwiches. Omg like I needed another reason to love this place so!! Yep I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've officially written this place off. And after reading all the one-star reviews it looks like I'm not the only one with these experiences. The women that work the coffee counter are the rudest, meanest, most hostile group of women I've ever encountered anywhere in my life. Called in curbside at 9AM to order an Americano. Pulled up at 9:15 to pick up by food and drink. Americano still not made. So I walk to counter. I politely ask about my drink. They forgot to make it. So I patiently wait. The girl makes my drink at 9:20am right in front of me and yells my name at the top of her lungs when it's ready while never once making eye contact. Then she has the audacity to say \"sorry if I just yelled in your face\". GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing. I LOVE their \"rocket man\" pizza and kale salad! Definitely recommend it for take out or a casual dinner atmosphere. I like to sit at the bar and the bartenders always friendly & delightful."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were relieved to have a delicious food option while waiting in between flights. Here are my strong recommendations for you to try when ordering:  1) Kale and Quinoa salad 2) Avocado pizza (must try if you like margarita pizzas and avocado- good combination!) 3) Gladiator pizza (red sauce is okay but the meat is good).  A 5/5 experience. Customer service was impressive. Upbeat attitude at the register and when we were finished with our food, we had an attendant who took away our pizza racks right away. Wow! Very happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"The worse pepperoni pizza I had tried.....bad taste, terrible after taste, and too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I have been driving by over and over, never thought to stop.  Until a friend told me they have awesome cakes.  I buy one and brought it to my in-laws.  They thought it was fantask.  The presentation was beautiful and tasted like sin.    So I returned to try their breakfast.  OMG!  I should have gone sooner!!  I loved the Commuter Sandwich with turkey.  YUMMY!  The LGO organic oatmeal was so decilious.  Need to go back to try the pancakes.  They looks and smelled so good.    Just thinking about it make me want to drool...."}
{"text":"Sensory overload here!!! Too many choices and everything looks amazing! They have a bakery, sushi, breakfast, pizza, sandwiches, barista, and fresh juice! You can sit outside , such a cute place! Really really busy"}
{"text":"Definitely a must have in the morning for ice coffee mocha with an extra shot of expresso!!   Their pastrami Ruben is excellent and my friend had the turkey Ruben.   This morning they were out of pastrami until 10am, so I ordered the Sammy Boy, which has turkey, pesto and prosciutto (add avocado) grilled with gruyere cheese."}
{"text":"Quick + Fresh + Vegan (super cheap) options!  Had spicy chickpea wrap + kale salad for $16 at the AIRPORT!   Would love to see this at LAX!!"}
{"text":"If you are a self employed person the bar side scene is gold. Great way to meet other quality people and naturally network. Decent food."}
{"text":"I have walked past LGO a dozen times because I thought it was just a coffee and snack place.  As it turns out, they have an impressive selection of fresh, green, and healthy creations ready for takeout for the hurried business traveler.  And for those in less of a hurry you've got sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and more cooked to order. I had the spicy chick pea lettuce wraps - I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but to my great surprise this dish not only tasted good, but actually filled me up too.    The layout of the joint was a bit confusing and the general flow of foot traffic needs improvement. I'll swing by for another bite next time I'm in this wing of the airport, especially considering the only other food option here is the less-than-average Mexican restaurant next door."}
{"text":"You guys just lost $20.00 in Business by not opening ON TIME at 5 AM!!  We had a flight to catch, and had to leave!!  We even knocked on the glass, but your staff could care less!!  I guess it's a good thing, because your overpriced Kale Salad is getting Smaller & Smaller!!"}
{"text":"I didn't have much time to enjoy. Just a quick bite/salad before my flight. It was a good tide-me-over till I get home. Tasty!!"}
{"text":"Date of Visit:  11.26.16            My first visit to LGO and it was simply awesome!  It was very busy and I felt sort of like a bull in a china shop in the grocery/gift shop area - very tight maneuvering around other shoppers and merchandise.  There is a great selection of unique foods, wines and gift items.  Orders are placed at the main counter and then, depending on the item ordered, there are different 'paths'.  If ordering a pizza, you can proceed to the pizza area (seat yourself) and wait for your name to be called.  For other items, you wait at the opposite end of the counter for you order and then take to the pizza area.  There is plenty of outdoor eating spaces.  A community table/bar is located in the pizza area with a couple of televisions.  I ordered the Gladiator pizza - very, very delicious - especially the crust which had a slightly chewy, sourdough taste.  My dining partner had The Garden sandwich and was impressed with the flavors.  It was a great experience and I'll be back soon....."}
{"text":"This place is great and they have something for everyone! We had the key lime pie and our gelato was 50% off for having a piece of pie. The taste of real cream on the pie was to die for. It was worth every penny. The gelato flavor I had was browned butter pecan. It was buttery and delicious. I highly recommend this place for a dessert if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have eaten some of the food in the grocery area, including the summer salad rolls, cupcakes, and one of the famous English Muffins.  My friend ordered a sandwich which appeared huge (probably for two meals!)  I should have ordered the sandwich; the summer salad rolls had some sort of mayo in them (I didn't realize this), and I hate mayo.  Besides that, I enjoyed my fat English muffin with delicious grape jelly. I took home a red velvet cupcake to last me a few days, and it was wonderfully moist with cream cheese icing.    The atmosphere seemed to be a fun chill vibe with somewhat friendly employees. Some were friendly, others seemed to have a bit of an attitude or just a bit aloof/rude.  While we were there, I heard about four The Decemberists songs, and that is always a plus for me!   The only problem I had was finding parking. I did not realize valet is complimentary (well free + tip).  I drove around forever, and it was crazy with cars everywhere. The residential areas within a 1-mile radius require a residential permit, or the car gets towed. So, beware of this prior to going!   Also, the prices are a bit more than I thought, but then again, it seems to be a typical trendy funky place near more pricey restaurants, so I should have known."}
{"text":"After a few visits here I can safely say LGO is tops on my places to eat in Phoenix. My friend who I stay with when I visit lives just down the road, so every time I visit him I know I'll stop in here for breakfast.   This last visit was no different. I came in here three different times over the course of a long weekend. My favorite is the French pancakes (more like crepes) and the Ricky Martin breakfast wrap. The fresh squeezed OJ and baked goods and gelato are perfect any time of the day as well.   I would actually take up residence in here if it was allowed. I love LGO that much. Can't wait to come back upon my next Phoenix visit!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if parking were more readily available - parking here is a nightmare which is why I don't come more often.  After having dinner next door at the pizzeria we headed over for some desserts, and got them to go. Delish!   With their popularity they really need to look into a second location or a bigger location to accommodate the demand."}
{"text":"Went to this place once and have gone back 3 more times. The gluten free chocolate cookies are amazing! Super gooey and chocolatey! A must try!"}
{"text":"Okay, now that I've been here three times, I feel comfortable with a 4 star review.  Went for breakfast once and lunch twice. Everything I've had was deelish and the prices are very reasonable. The Croque Madame was a great satisfying breakfast sandwich (open face) that was a bit tricky to cut/eat but the Gruyere, Ham and tomato on whole-grain is top-notch. A sunny-side-up egg tops it off and you won't be hungry for a few hours... ...too bad because you'll want to save room for any one of the amazing cookies, bars, cakes and scones in their enticing bakery case. I highly recommend the red velvet bar and the old-fashioned chocolate cupcake (with white curly q's ala hostess).  The chicken salad sandwich is moist and tasty and served open-faced, while the hot pressed Cuban sandwich is wonderful on a cool day. Served with fresh pineapple on the side, each item is in the $7 range (very good for the serving size, IMO).  About the only downers were lack of parking and having to wait for a seat (when it's busy, which is pretty much ALL the time)."}
{"text":"The turkey salad is delicious but the reuben sandwich was amazing. I usually don't even like reuben sandwiches, that's how good it was."}
{"text":"I come from a city where Brunch is taken uber seriously. In fact Brunch in all of its forms (breakfast and lunch) are a way of life where I live. On my visit to LGO I was introduced to what Phx has to offer in the way of \"brunch\" The food was ok...but I've had better. I went with the commuter Sandwich. I was happy with my choice but I wasn't thinking...wow this is the best think I've eaten. I just thought it was...well..O.K. Nothing stood out about this place to me but my lovely friend seems to enjoy the place. I thought...well it looks like a boutique grocery store that serves food. We have these and older ones that are run by Italian families in my city. I wasn't taken back but I can see how this place can be charming. Like I said its ok..I'd suggest you go...you may love it but one thing I know for sure..no one will hate this place..they'll just shrug and say its not bad."}
{"text":"The parking is HORRIBLE!  The setup for ordering is confusing and disorganized.  I can totally look past all that though with one bite of the pressed tuna sandwich.  Sheer deliciousness!!  I also ordered two dessert bites: a small red velvet cupcake and a mini chocolate cupcake.  I wished I hadn't ordered them in the mini size.  One bite was just not enough!  They were so moist with just the right sweetness.  If I can suck it up and get in a zen mood to deal with the parking and the crazy ordering line, I will absolutely be back!    If you are planning on having a nice conversation with a friend, eat outside.  I could barely hear myself think!"}
{"text":"Passing thru on my way to L.A. And I JD to have some coffee. I went for the Carmel latte and it is delicious. Don't hesitate when stopping in Phoenix, Arizona Airport."}
{"text":"I don't leave Downtown often (read: ever) because there isn't much I can't find between 19th Ave & 16th St.  However, there are a few notable exceptions, one being the Commuter sandwich. Sometimes I wake up thinking about it, and my only option to clear my mind is to find the quickest way to Arcadia.  Fluffy scrambled eggs, tomato, mayo & filling of choice (I generally opt for the bacon or avocado) on a huge, warm, homemade English muffin. t is simple.. yet exquisite to my taste buds. I usually get a Tammie Coe cupcake to go for later consumption, but today I got a Halloween-themed chocolate & orange cupcake from the LGO Bake Shop, and it was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had..& I've had a lot of cupcakes in my day.  There is always a line but unless you're in a hurry it's not so bad since there is so much to look at while waiting. There are always new, random knickknacks and cute greeting cards. Today I checked out a cell phone holder that hoists your phone while it charges.. interesting.. The shop tends to be pretty pricey, but I guess that doesn't bother me so much since I keep going back. I really do hate trying to park though."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! If I lived here, I'd eat here once a week. Everything is delicious. They have things like croque-monsieur sammys, soups, baked goods, pizzas, & brunch style foods.  In addition to really good food, I remember they made a really tasty key lime pie dessert and a very good lemonade.  Parking here was really difficult but definitely worth it.  p.s. I hear it is now open in Pasadena!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Both for breakfast (mostly healthy fare with stoopidly delicious muffins in case you just hiked to the top of Camelback the long way and have totally earned it...) and their pizzas are the best I've had outside Naples.  The atmosphere makes me feel like I've left my life and wandered onto a movie set where everything is under control and much cooler than IRL.  And it's so Arcadia - but old school Arcadia where citrus still matters and it's much more about community and a real gathering place and not so much about the mega mansions and range rovers...  Parking sucks, but you can park across the street or in Postino's lot safely.  And you can drink coffee and eat outside under the shade trees - and life really does just slow down for a few minutes.  Need a little gift for someone?  Whoever is curating their merchandise is  world class.  I don't get to Phoenix that much anymore but I never leave without seriously enjoying looking at everything and crossing many upcoming birthday, Mother's Day, anniversary etc to dos off my list .  Love this place to its core.  If you haven't, I promise you'll not regret checking it out!"}
{"text":"Always seems crowded and overpriced, but great food and a favorite of the locals."}
{"text":"This pains me to write this review and I am giving 2 stars out of fairness and previously solid history with LGO as I live a few blocks away.  I have been there hundreds of times previously.  I have had many wonderful experiences previously and have referred dozens of friends to LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen, Postino, etc.    So, it's this past Sunday morning and I run in real quick for a few breakfast items, those being English muffins and a regular iced mocha latte.  The place was packed as usual but seemed more so because of far too much merchandise and no where for people to wait or even stand.  The service was friendly.  In case you haven't tried the English muffins, they come in a 5 pack and they are very tasty-a must have and great toasted.    My heart burn on this visit begins at the register.  Two two items together totaled $18.02.  I was shocked so I asked the girl at the coffee bar register if she rang it in right and she assured me she did. She was very nice about it but OMG WTF?  I paid and came home.  The mocha was way too sweet and not even comparable to Starbuck's(which I do not like for the record).  So, essentially, I paid $18.02 for a pack of English muffins.  Ridiculous!  Will I go back?  Most assuredly I will but it will be a bit before I do."}
{"text":"Eew!!! A salad with shredded iceberg lettuce and a few measly specks of bell pepper topped with disgustingly shredded chicken. Dressing was way too oily. The whole experience was less than mediocre. Fortunately I'm not in Phoenix too often in the D Terminal. Will eat somewhere else next time!!"}
{"text":"Got it on my flight out. I ordered the green chili burger. The server was very nice, but the place was a cluster. There was no line and people just standing around.   After about 30 min I asked how much longer, I was told it would be 15 min when I ordered. They looked at my receipt and didn't even have it at their window. The guy had the cook make one in 3 min. I ordered it medium, so warm pink center, but I got it still somewhat raw in the middle. It still tasted decent but was expensive. I would not return to here, but their pizza looked good."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed.  I drove past several \"real\" restaurants to get to the airport early because a Phoenix local said they were excellent. Not sure what I was expecting, but it sure wasn't this. The California burger was just passable.  The counter person emphasized how they cook their patties medium.  Mine was medium well PLUS.  No moisture left in the meat and it was nothing more than an $11 slider.  The sea salt brownie was inedible. The texture was supposed to be fudgy but came off as undercooked.  Tables are basically on the concourse so after settling diwn you have to pick up your things and try to balance it all with your plate of food.  A juggling act for the lone traveler.  The one bright spot was the hand cut well seasoned fries. Brought back memories of pre-franchise Chili's in the 70s or early 80s.  Two stars is probably generous."}
{"text":"The vibe and environment of LGO is definitely a great place - open space, lovely people, friendly staff, plenty of seatings, etc. all good stuff. A minus on the parking on a busy weekend afternoon.   As for the food, the sandwich menu is great. I tried the Reuben today. Simply delicious. We also had the pizza, more specifically the fallen angel. It was fine. Decent pizza. Nothing to write home about. Regarding the salad: the menu looked really good until I found out it was pre-made and in a plastic box sitting to be picked up in the fridge-like storage space by the door. Definitely a disappointment.   Overall a good space for coffee, a sandwich and a meet up point. It's 3 miles from the house. I can see myself running there for lunch and maybe run home. I'll come back again. Definitely worth a try and a return.   -- Keep eatin'"}
{"text":"Five stars- no question about it!  LGO is one if my phx faves. I love that they focus on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, eco friendly goods and of course a true focus on making delicious food!   Head there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This cozy spot packs in so much charm its amazing! You'll have sensory overload upon walking in as you set your eyes in wine racks, shelved lined with gifts for all- from books to candles, candy kids toys and seriously so much more. Everything is clearly thoughtfully selected. You'll want to buy everything!   Ready made salads, sandwiches, fresh juices and more will make for a difficult decision, but you can't go wrong with anything here. And be sure to save room for dessert or take some to go! It's simply gorgeous.   LGO is upbeat and refreshing. This place can get packed but they manage crowds well and with a smile! Parking is tight, so avoiding peak hours is key.   LGO- come to Tucson!"}
{"text":"I have not been to LGO since late last year and we decided to try their new gluten free pizza yesterday for Sunday lunch.  Going to LGO - it's kinda like a scanvengar hunt! Now, I am no newbie to this place, but I completely forgot how it all works since I haven't been since last year - I just got so confused!    Now, parking is a little tough around these neighborhoods - you have a small parking lot in the front of LGO, parking lot in Postinos, and a small lot across the street by the burger joint.  I'm guessing there is another parking lot as I saw signs.  We did find a spot so first move - cleared.  First off, we walk into the restaurant side - and i'm thinking you get seated by a hostess, but I guess you don't. There is so much people eating their food.  It can get quite crowded. So where do we go next? We decided to walk to the grocery store side.  The place kinda reminds me of a hoarded grocery store/restaurant - people, unorganized clutter of shopping items, signs everywhere that you don't really know how the process of ordering and getting your food is, etc. Once you get to the grocery side, you go to the cashier (by the pastries) and order your food from the chalking board menu - there are several boards I must add. Sometimes you can read the board and sometimes you think you know what it says so you guess in your head.  There are several items right next to you (salads, other one off items that I guess you can look at before you walk up to order). You then order - 1) Avocado pizza with gluten free crust 2) Two gluten free chocolate walnut cookies.    Ok. then what?  Then the cashier gives you your cookies and you go somewhere on the left to find some water you can pour for yourself.  Ok!  I found the water - It's back by the restaurant side - cleared.  Oh, you also have to find some napkins and utencils too. Found it - cleared.  Then you find a seat and you wait for your name to be called - some guy from the restaurant side calls out and we get our food.  Done.  What an adventure!  On to the food tasting.  Pizza was good - the combination of cheese, tomato, avocado and proscuitto was pretty good, however the gluten free crust was \"eh\".  The gf chocolate walnut cookies were pretty big cookies and they were pretty amazing.  We ended  up having leftovers so again, had to go find the to-go containers.  This time, it wasn't so hard anymore.   We walk out and we made it!  Woo!"}
{"text":"When co-workers suggested that we meet here for Coffee one morning, I thought they were nuts.  Coffee at a grocery store?  Well, I guess judging by the long lines of people, it's a very popular joint.  We ordered some Coffee, Muffins, and some other sweet stuff (I don't know what it was, they ordered it).  I had a Blueberry Muffin, which was awesome.  The Coffee was some kind of Organic Ethiopian blend...it had a distinct, sharp flavor to it and was pretty strong, but very good.  The store part of the place was very busy and so was the dining/sitting area.  We sat in a large booth which was comfortable for 4 of us.  The absolute worse part of visiting this place is the parking.  The parking lot simply cannot handle their volume.  I had to park across the street, which is a pretty busy street.....sounds like a petty thing, but I wouldn't want to do it in the Summer when temps are 115+ and you have to wait for the crosswalk light.  5 Stars for the Food/Coffee, 1 Star for the parking.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced -- a great trifecta! Add in fast, and you've got a winner. Right after my arrival into PHX, Gabi K. brought me here, one of her favorite places for lunch.  I knew she had good taste!  I grabbed an avocado BLT, and I couldn't even believe how generous they were with the bacon -- there must have been 6-8 slices piled onto that sandwich, and it was just the right crispness. Bacon is to credit and blame for my fall from 12 years of vegetarianism, so this much bacon still feels truly indulgent!   They have a great assortment of salads, sushi, and beverages.  They also have loads of specialty foods, including jams and spreads, as well as some gift items. On the gift side of things, I admired some cool and colorful re-purposed magazines that were made into decorative vessels.   It really seemed like a wonderful one-stop place to have in the neighborhood. I like the idea of being able to pick up a quality sandwich, some groceries, and a present for someone, all at once!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner in the bar area, which is open seating and full service. I had a glass of their red blend wine, which I really enjoyed. For dinner, we spilt the kale and quinoa salad and the fallen angel pizza! I loved both! The salad was light and fresh, with little dressing, yet still extremely flavorful due to the fresh Parmesan. I appreciated that they spilt the salad on two plates for us. The pizza was topped with sausage and peppers, and cooked perfectly. I was disappointed that they were out of my first two dessert picks. But we ended up ordering the salted chocolate chip cookie, which was delicious. The sea salt that tops the cookie really enhances and balances the sweet flavor."}
{"text":"Used to be a fantastic place to go but for the past few months the customer service at the counter and in the market have thoroughly gone down hill.  If your ok with customer service with an appalling annoyed attitude this is the place for you during most mornings. The restaurant staff in the evening and the food is still top notch but avoid the counter service and curbside staff during the day."}
{"text":"Wow!  This was really good food.  No not just really good food for an airport.  But really good food for a restaurant.        Quantities are huge especially for what I got.  The vegan spicy chickpea lettuce wraps.  Massive scoops of spicy chickpeas on half a lettuce wedge with fresh avocado and sun dried tomatoes.  My wife enjoyed her tuna melt.  My daughter had a kid grilled cheese with some french fries that were really crispy and delicious.  She topped it off with some chocolate ice cream.       Great place to grab a bite at the Phoenix Airport.  Lots of options.  Sandwiches, breakfast, salads, pizzas, ice cream and snacks."}
{"text":"So awesome that La Grande Orange is at terminal 4.  I love that terminal 4 has the best of the best of PHX local restaurants.  What an awesome surprise.  I have always enjoyed La Grange Orange their great salads, sandwiches, great pizza selections and reasonably prices on beer and wine.  You can't go wrong grabbing something great to eat prior to catching your flight.    LGO -great food & great service!"}
{"text":"Passport Blend iced tea = the nectar of the gods. They'll even fill a growler of it for you!  I love LGO and have loved it since they first opened and no one was there. I've noticed their counter service slipping over the past few years, as well as the quality of the food overall, but then they'll change my perception of all that with amazing new cookies and salads/breakfast dishes.   Can't miss place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the best spot in the Phoenix airport if you're looking for a creative menu. Everything is fresh and tastes good. You can stick to your diet here without having to settle for the usual yogurt cup or pathetic, overpriced salad. They're vegetarian friendly too! I had the tomato soup this time and it was excellent. Everything I've had here has been good."}
{"text":"The strawberry sorbet tastes like middle school... Sounds super weird but once you try it, you'll understand."}
{"text":"I had a layover in PHX and this place was literally right next to the gate for my next flight. By far and large the best food I have ever had at an airport in my life and rivals some of the best pizza I've had anywhere. What a find! I had the margherita pizza and it had perfect crust, perfect cheese, perfect tomatos, perfect everything. I also shared the kale and quinoa salad which was a wonderful mix of flavors (I am not a salad person). I also had the chocolate chip sea salt cookie and some chocolate pastry that looked a bit like a hostess cupcake. Both were amazing! The only thing that wasn't amazing was the honey latte (too much sweet, not enough espresso) but that's just my taste.  Seriously if I ever find myself in Phoenix, airport or town, I'm vlining for this place."}
{"text":"I love La Grande, they have made improvements to their eatery and their pizza is awesome. Love all the cheeses and wines and pesto in their market. The setting is great in a neighborhood instead of some busy transit street. Parking can be difficult but as in any place, go at the right time and be patient, someone is bound to leave soon so you can park. I give it all Fingers up!"}
{"text":"I live super close to LGO, and come here regularly for coffee and sometimes breakfast. This place has a great vibe and super good coffee (there are lots of fair trade and organic options). The grapefruit sunrise juice (grapefruit and pomegranate) is also amazing. So for food and coffee, LGO gets 5 stars.  Downside: on the weekends, this place gets PACKED. Because there is so much merchandise inside, it is almost impossible to move between all the people and stuff. The staff gets cranky, too. I mean, a smile would be nice!   The coffee cart outside is a great option if you know what you want to order and want to avoid the crowds. There are even some cute picnic tables by the cart if you want to stick around to enjoy your food, and the servers outside are always super pleasant.   Before you leave, check out the wine area. I love to peruse a cute wine shop, and LGO has a fun selection."}
{"text":"I have always like this place when I'm in PHX airport. I always buy their Kale Quinoa salad. It taste good. They have good customer service too. At least every person who helped me here are nice. They have variety of pastries and they all look good too. I haven't really tried all the entree in their menu, but they all look yummy."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference meeting and yelped my heart out to find a really great breakfast place...and behold my yelper friends you have delivered once again!!  I was a little confused and didn't know how to order my Sunday breakfast, first we had to find seating, from there get in line, order and then apparently you go pick up your own food inside when they call your name!  Whew!  We both ordered the Commuter Sandwich, I ordered w/ bacon and avocado and my hubby ordered it w/ ham and avocado.  Holy cow!!  This is the best english muffin sandwich I've ever eaten!  Sorry Mickey D's!  The bacon was salty and crispy, the egg was fluffy and the avocados were just ripe enough!!    I wish I lived in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Nice little cozy neighborhood market.  I was in the area and decided to drop by to check out what was fresh and get a drink.  From reading the other reviews I would've love to try their pizza.  The place reminds me of Dean & Deluca in a smaller package.  I usually don't eat sushi from markets but even their sushi looked appetizing."}
{"text":"Airport and Pizza.  Two words that seemingly don't go together.  Who hasn't experienced scary airport food at one time or another?  Well, thanks to the new LGO in the airport, that is a thing of the past.  Airport + LGO Pizza = YUM!  :)  While I am aware that LGO has plenty of other great things besides pizza, (breakfast, sandwiches, burgers...) once I saw the wood-fired oven I knew I had to have one.  I chose the basic cheese pizza, which was anything but plain.  Perfectly cooked with a crisp yet somewhat chewy crust and a blend of bubbling savory cheeses.  Large enough to share, but I am not ashamed to say I ate every last bite!  Really?  A wood-fired oven in the airport?  I may have to travel more often..."}
{"text":"How refreshing to eat some good airport food.  Great turkey salad and awesome Marg pizza. Not sure what the \"premium cheese\" is but it's divine. Yum.  Would have gotten 5 stars if tables were cleaned.  You're almost there!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. It seems like Phoenix holds so many of these cool little coffee shop/food places, but this by far has been one of my favorites. I got the commuter sandwich, basically a souped up breakfast sandwich. But they let you add anything you want to it and really personalize it. For me, I got egg whites, avocado, and extra bacon.Killer. I also got a chai latte and it was very good.   They have a really unique selection of wine and beer, flanking the back walls in the grocery section. And they have so many neat notebooks, candles, greeting cards, and other unique items you wouldn't really see too many places.   They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but just a tip! I went during week day prime time (between 9am and 10am) and it was a little bit hard finding a place to sit! Luckily, some spots cleared up.  And bonus! They serve both lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in the valley. My husband and I largely eat gluten free and therefore believe that they have a fantastic gluten free pizza. They have a decent wine selection. We love grabbing a bottle and a pizza and sitting on the picnic tables on a cool night."}
{"text":"Girls love this place. (Including my girlfriend, who suggested that sentence.)  It has the makings of a great lunch spot: very good sandwiches, newspapers of every variety, good service, and nice decor.   There are a number of problems that are developing here though, including the ongoing parking problem, and the women that think they still look really fly in velour jumpsuits.   If you can work around those, drop by and get one of the egg sandwiches for lunch and try to snag a table."}
{"text":"Pizza and sandwiches are awesome. Wine is delicious as well. It can have a long wait and ordering can be tricky for your first time. You gotta do yourself a favor and check out the store. It has some of the cutest items and apparel. Think a food version of urban outfitters.. Super cute ad trendy. The wines are from all over! Loved the commuter sandwich for breakfast. Parking can be rough at times."}
{"text":"Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I love this little market. Everything is made fresh and in house. Fresh salads, sandwiches, pastries, and breakfast items are all very well done without being too fussy. I was really impressed when I ordered my dirty chai and asked for almond milk to find out they make their own. Also, I'm typically not a big fan of english muffins but theirs are amazing. They are worth the $9 for the pack! And if the key lime pie is in the case, get a slice! I'm obsessed with figuring out what's in the crust. I would be so very happy if a location opened up in San Diego because Phoenix is a bit of a drive for English Muffins."}
{"text":"I first heard of La Grande about 2 or 3 years ago. I stopped by on a weekend afternoon and had a difficult time locating parking; being naive of the place, I didn't realize additional parking was available about 2 blocks away, as well as behind La Grande; between La Grande and Postino's. This is currently my favorite place to eat. It's a grocery store and a Pizzeria next door. At first it seems compact when walking in through the grocery store. They definitely utilize every inch of space they can muster up to display their goods. The food offerings are wide and are displayed above the counter/employee area from one end of the store to almost the other. The selection appears to be a mixture of French and Italian. I've been a regular for about 2 months now (as of the writing of this review) and frequent at least once each weekend; sometimes twice.   There's so much to choose from and I've just barely scratched the surface. I've definitely picked out some favorites that I'm having difficulty swaying away from; thus, preventing me from trying something new. I totally love the Coconut Samoan Latte. The small & large are apparently the same volume, which confused me when I ordered the large and my companion ordered the small; the difference between the two is that the large has an extra shot of espresso. I also love the Fresh Fish Club Sandwich, which comes with a side. I've had it with fries and with a mix of vegetables, which appeared steamed. I'm not sure what La Grande called the veggies or if it's a regular side offering (it had a really long name). They have muffins made in the original French-style that I highly recommend. It comes in a bag of 6 for $9. You also need to go for the Avocado Pizza with Prosciutto. The prosciutto is an extra $3, but is so worth it. I had Easter Sunday breakfast here and had a muffin sandwich with eggs, sausage, and cheese. It sounds simple, but tasted soooooo good. I think the butter made it taste so good. And desert....DON'T FORGET DESERT!!! I love the peanut butter pie.  Remember, this is a grocery so there are a number of other items to look through, which makes visiting all the more fun. There's a refrigerated area with all kinds of beer and non-alcoholic beverages. There's also an area with ready-made foods packed in plastic to-go boxes. A coffee bar is located towards the left as you come in. A grill is located outside. I'm not sure when the grill is used. I think it's used in the mornings. There are also a wide selection of wines. Further into it, there are a large number of non-food items such as shirts, scented candles, specialty soaps, books, etc.   The place has high traffic and as aforementioned uses all it's space, but there's plenty of room to sit both inside and outside. I love how wooden picnic tables are offered in the north of the grocery store. The neighboring La Grande Orange Pizzeria also offers plenty of seating for patrons of the Grocery Store. Outside seating is also located at the front of the store.  This place is definitely not boring and I tried to cover as much of what I've noticed and experienced so far. I highly recommend visiting if you haven't already, as you'll probably get hooked too. This corner of 40th St & Campbell (or at least I think it's Campbell) has much to offer to the food-lover with Ingo's to the north and Postino's to the west. I can't to wait to stop by again next weekend!"}
{"text":"I've decided that I must yelp review some of my all time favorite places across the country.  La Grand Orange (LGO) is one of them.  LGO has that ambiance that instantly makes you feel warm and happy inside. People are friendly, the food is delightful, music is wonderful, and everything combines to make you have one of those moments where you look around and realize \"I'm so happy!\"  It's a sensory overload, and it's so great that you don't even notice the long lines and prices.   I could also do without the merchandise, although I would really love to replace my LGO mug that I lost.  What I can't live without is the Havana Latte.  Picture this: whole milk, sweetened condense milk, espresso...it is heaven in your mouth. I want to insert a million expletives just to show my passion for it.  Need food to go with your drink? The Jersey Omelette is delish. Really anything is awesome.  And! You're welcome to bring in your laptop and do whatever.   LGO is one of the only things I miss about Phoenix. If I could've packed it up, I would have taken it with me."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm. Delicious home made almond milk for our almond milk lattes. Wish we had this super cute, tasty spot down in Hermosa Beach. See you next time we're in AZ!"}
{"text":"the parking sucks no matter when you go.  okay, i had to get that out of they way.  onto the good stuff.  the food here is heaven!!!!  i have tried the salads, reuben, tuna sandwich, red velvet cake and they are all great.  i love the green chile burger!  it's the best i have ever had!  damn now i'm hungry.  the fries are great.  oh and this is the best place for an arnold palmer.  the best damn place ever."}
{"text":"Five star every time! Every time!!!! The pizzas are fantastic. We ordered the margarita and pepperoni pizzas and they arrived so hot I had to blow on it before taking a bite, how often does that happen when you out out? Insane, the favors were insane!!!"}
{"text":"Too much hype about this place, really.  The menu is creative and it has a good concept but I think they are resting on their laurels.  We had the Orange Fennel Salad and the Margarita Pizza.  The salad was fresh and heavily dressed, good stuff.  The pizza was some of the worst I've had.  Very arrogant and unappreciative staff, except for the busboy/waiter that they bossed around, he was nice.  One note, I had heard that Phx can be a pretty vapid place, full of plastic people who are out of touch with reality.  Living in Tempe and spending time in downtown Phx, I had no contact with this side of Phx really.  Enter Le Grande Orange."}
{"text":"Best airport restaurant that I have ever seen.  Something for everyone, my wife had an awesome salad, I had a Cuban sandwich, while my son had a wood-fired pizza.  Clean, affordable, and inexpensive.  They made a mistake on my Cuban and gave us a free red velvet cupcake.  An airport establishment that is concerned with customer service???  What a pleasant surprise.  If you are in this terminal, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast sandwiches, but very odd layout and super loud music. Arcadia fixture that has been here forever. This place just seems like it can't make up its mind. I want to be a little shop and sell soap and candles! No wait I want to be a shop and sell wine and gourmet picnic food and chocolate, no wait I'm a restaurant, no wait I'm a order over the counter and seat yourself place...then walk way over to the other dining room where they sell pizza to sit down. Confused. Wait till you get here. The back entrance takes you through the kitchen! Too much going on here but at least the food is good."}
{"text":"I have never been to a LGO. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. They made some great suggestions and made sure I knew all of the options. The dining room staff member seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, kept all the tables clean and worked very fast and efficiently. The cookies are HUGE and tasted great and fresh. The burger is more of a slider when it comes to size. So you may consider getting a side. Most of the guests I saw in the dining area ordered freshly made pizzas that looked outstanding! I would stop by here again when visiting the airport!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Bustling for breakfast. Lots of healthy and exciting options to choose from. Well executed! Great beer, wine, and cheese selection! Outdoor seating! A little hectic, but just expect it an you'll enjoy it. Fun place with great food. Good place for kids too. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable. It's perfect for lunch. They have a little shop with an assortment of things - from notecards and miscellaneous to drinks and food and snacks. You can also order off their menu from the counter. Seriously, you can't go wrong here. The food is always great, the drinks are tasty and when the weather's nice you can grab a little table outside and just enjoy it."}
{"text":"Neat place, could spend awhile browsing while waiting for food.  Tried the French pancakes (crepes) with everyone on it.  Also good and not nearly as heavy as I thought they'd be.  Really want to go back and try some of their lunch items."}
{"text":"LGO is such a great place to grab brekkie, lunch, dinner, or to hangout and get some work done! Their lattes are SO good. I took my mom here for breakfast and we each got two lattes then came back the next day. Great food and atmosphere. Definitely a must see. I've been here for dinner (awesome pizza) and breakfast and lunch. All are delicious! The egg salad open sandwich was unreal. If you're in town, a must see!"}
{"text":"The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is da bomb!! It was SOOO good!! It is also a very big cookie, so I was able to enjoy the cookie for two days.   The atmosphere seemed cool, I really want to try their rotisserie chicken, it looked very good.  We went to find a christmas gift. They have a lot of unique things so we had fun looking around, but they were all very expensive. We ended up getting the foodie fight game as a gift.   I would so go back for another one of their cookies!!"}
{"text":"They have some really great foods. They also offer some gluten free options, however they keep the gluten free stuff next to all of the gluten products.   The worst part about this place is the staff. There are a few great employees here but most in the front are really really bratty teenagers that are not trained in customer service.   I've been in several times and heard them taking bad about their schedules and other girls in the restaurant. It's really off putting, especially when yo are hungry and there is a line. I've said something a couple times but the employee or mgr who is on the ball always apologizes and then doesn't do anything to correct the i"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here several times and i always get the zuni burrito which is tofu chorizo. Im not vegan but i like it. The wait today was ridiculous though. Normally i get my food in a reasonable amount of time but thus time...  Fortunately, i was just dropping my son off and was not in a rush."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of LGO.  My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.  The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold.   The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.  The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.  LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly."}
{"text":"Love LGO! It reminds of a combination of Anthropologie meets a hipster coffee joint + farmers market.  Not only do I love their food, but I love their shop - they have the best gifts that make for tons of entertainment while waiting for your food.  I've had several items on their menu, though I love their tuna salad the best.  It's got a few unusual items mixed in, and it's wonderful.  It's a little on the sweet side, definitely a unique twist on a standard lunch item.  It's great on a sandwich or atop mixed greens.  The parking here is pretty crappy, which is the only reason I didn't give this place a fifth star.  The lot is teeny tiny, and because LGO is so good, it's always packed.  They do have 'complimentary valet,' but who has cash to tip them? I don't, and so valeting, while convenient, is always a pain.  I highly recommend going here for breakfast or lunch - their food/pastries are amazing, their coffee/chai tea/green tea are awesome, and they have a huge dining area, with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's super busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait in long lines in the restaurant as well as outside in the parking area. They serve up pizzas, gourmet salads, gourmet sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, freshly squeezed juices and all sorts of other things, all made to order. You order everything upfront at the counter and then pick it up once its made. Good luck with finding a table in their huge dining area...so if you want to experience the la grande orange cafe then go early or after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is one of my favorite spots to eat.  The environment mixed with the amazing food, is a huge plus for me.  This is not your average dining experience.  The restaurant is set up in an eclectic manner, with the flow of the line that goes through a cute boutique.  The food is absolutely amazing! I've eaten both breakfast and lunch here, and I've never been disappointed.  You can tell the creations are unique, handmade, and I often feel like the cooks are looking to top themselves. The environment is clean, refreshing (outside dining available) and fun.  I always take visitors to Az to La Grande Orange for the experience alone. Yes, try the orange juice...that is even good."}
{"text":"I had the best seasalt chocolate chip cookie of my life at La Grande Orange during a recent layover in Phoenix. I live in California and do not have access to these incredible cookies on a regular basis.I am seriously considering going to Phoenix, just so I can get my hands on more of them!!"}
{"text":"I love how vegan friendly the market is! I went today to get one of their delicious vegan apple cookies. They are delightful! I like how chewy they are, and they are huge!   However, I noticed a vegan peanut butter sandwich cookie on the menu today. I decided to give it a try as well. It was basically two crackers with peanut butter between them. Somewhat lame! The cookie is worth the parking lot battles though. I haven't tried their homemade vegan cheese yet, but have heard that it's good.  Tip: have someone drop you off and circle."}
{"text":"Had dinner here couple weeks ago for the 1st time and had the best white sangria. We were in big group and had few pizza and it was excellent! The staffs were super nice, we love this place! Unfortunately I forgot to take some pictures.  Parking is very limited."}
{"text":"Love it except its such a cluster inside-between all the store items for sale and people waiting for there orders and employees squeezing by to work.  Had the commuter  which was a homeade english muff with mayo, egg tomato and your choice of meat or avocado.  Soooo good!  The menu has such a variety-pizza, sushi, breakfast, lunch.  Saw some hot pressed tuna sandwiches that looked amazing as well.    I wish I could come here more often but its a little out of the way.  Also, I'd be 50 pounds heavier lol."}
{"text":"Avocado pizza was decent. The shop next store is very cute and a nice way to pass time while you wait for a table. Or if you go for breakfast its a nice way to pass a few mins.  I was disappointed the last time I was in as my order was completely lost and I patiently waited for about 30 mins and had to go up and reorder. But they did comp my meal so I'll let it slide this time :) But the breakfast I had was simple and healthy. Exactly what I was looking for that day."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to go out for dinner and drinks tonight. We picked La Grande Orange because we had never been there before. When we got there, there was a wait so I decided to go to the bar to get a glass of wine in the meantime. I asked the bartender for a glass of Pinot Noir. Considering all of the wines on the menu posted above the bar were around $6.00 to $8.00, I figured my drink would be about the same price. However when she gave me my glass of wine, I was shocked to see it was $14.00. When we finally got seated, we were handed an actual drink menu from the waitress. To my surprise, the Pinot Noir BOTTLES of wine they had available were between $9.00 and $20.00.. I expressed my disbelief that I just paid $14.00 for one glass when an entire bottle was sold there for less. The waitress basically told me that I had been ripped off by the bartender. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because our waitress was honest and straightforward, and the food was very good. However, I can't get over the fact that the brunette bartender who works Friday night would secretly serve me one of the most expensive glasses of wine at the bar. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"A ton of great bakery options, even late in the day. I got a giant s'mores cupcake (~$4), a mini red velvet cupcake with edible glitter (~$2), and a \"Mayan latte\" (latte with cinnamon, ~$4). I also got to finish off my friend's strawberry and lemon gelato and they were super fresh and refreshing after the heavy chocolate cake. Everything was delicious!  The store/grocery part itself had a lot more gift items than food, but there was plenty of wine and beer to choose from (though at slightly higher prices than a large chain liquor store). Tons of cute novelty things that were fun to look at before ordering dessert.  There are about three different \"locations\" inside the one room - LGO Bakery, LGO Grocery, a gelato shop (Grateful Spoon), and then it's connected to the pizzeria. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Healthy choices, delicious food, and friendly staff makes for a pleasant long layover experience. Very pleased that I Yelped this place. I walked the concourse from the other side of the airport to get to this place and was pretty happy with my decision. Lots of options to choose from here including burgers, pizza, sandwiches,and salads to name a few. The dessert counter also looked quite tempting. You can either grab a meal to go or order and sit down on one of the many tables they have here. Plenty of space to plop open your laptop and to grab a quick bite to eat.   Big plus: They carry sriracha (rooster) hot sauce here as a condiment!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Grocery store has some cool original items but can be a bit too pricey. The Pizza is awesome my favorite over all the pizza spots in town. Great atmosphere. Parking can be a pain at busy hours but you can also order pizza to pick up and there are open spots to pull up and they will bring out pizza to your car. Prices are good too. Great coffee. breakfast is good too."}
{"text":"Love this place.   They have a bunch of great little kitchy gifts, sweet-arabilia (candies from \"yester years\"), some great wines, and a great deli counter.  A few of my faves to leave w/, or find a table to enjoy at outside if I can, their hot pressed cubano and a coconut cupcake. De-e-a-licious.  Its always crowded here, but if you wait out the line, youll see why."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery (and the next door Restaurant): what a find (destination) in PHX!   It is worth the short from downtown or Scottsdale to experience this very cool establishment.  When you're shopping, have a glass of wine in the wine bar adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was good and fast even when it was crowded. the vegetarian sandwiche is awesome"}
{"text":"The place has tasty, fresh and natural food. But the 3 stars goes because service is a big chaos!. The self service doesn't work with the place stuffed with shelf after shelf of products. They have ppl \"working\" there, but no one seems to do much, and when ever you are waiting for your order, the question \"what are you waiting?\" won't make your order faster. Parking? the free valet parking is just an illusion. Other than that...the best is the gelato place next to them."}
{"text":"It is so nice being able to have GOOD food at the airport instead of standard fast food junk. I've enjoyed dinner on the go from LGO the last two times I've flown. I love that the salads are quick and ready to go. The smoked salmon salad is delicious and filling. It doesn't look like a lot when you first open the container but it's bigger than you think.  Their pizza is also very good but head's up - it's not premade so it takes about 15 minutes. Make sure you have enough time to wait. Their bakery items are also really yummy.  The set-up seems a little confusing for people but the staff is friendly. This place definitely makes airport food not only bearable but actually enjoyable."}
{"text":"With a fairly large selection of dynamite sandwiches and sugary baked goods, LGO has become a pretty regular staple for me at lunchtime. It has an open and relaxing atmosphere with lots of windows and natural lighting, a solid beer and even solider wine selection, and a grocery store with cute little knick knacks that's fun to peruse. This place is great."}
{"text":"The cookies here are fantastic.  Big, thick, and delicious.  The employees who work here are typical airport employees though.  overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Our department ordered \"take-out\" this afternoon to celebrate one of our colleague's resignation, and I offered to drive and pick up all orders using their Curbside Pick-Up. Prior to leaving my office, I called each order in and the lady even repeated them back to me carefully for accuracy - great!  I found them easily and loved their designated Curbside spaces marked with bright signs. I was immediately addressed and was asked to sit tight for everything to be completed. Okay - no prob. I had my A/C flowing, jams were going, and I could mindlessly surf on my iPhone.   I waited maybe 7-10min and 2 ladies brought out 2 large shopping bags of the orders. One offered to put them in my back seat which I welcomed with open arms. Bill was paid, tip was left, and I was on my way back to my hungry coworkers.  Since I'm OCD-Rainman, I organized all orders and put post-its on each order for simplicity. I stopped dead in my tracks when the colleague who's leaving us (lunch is in her honor) did not have any pizza or slice of Red Velvet. None. Not one crumb. I started to grind my molars.   The matter was quickly remedied as another peer offered to drive back for me and pick up the missing order while I called them. Was pissed bc they charged my debit for both items! Of course, I didn't check the bags to do a quick inventory before leaving, but I feel like I shouldn't have to at this type of place. McD's maybe, but not LGO. Holly answered my call and was very apologetic. She credited my debit card for the 2 items and promised when my coworker arrived, it wld be remade and hot/ready.   Co worker came back with the promised items in hand as well as a nice $20 gift card for me.  Things worked out nicely. I'm not going to hold this against them. BTW: My salmon (raw) salad was a very solid choice - ingredients worked well together!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at noon = AWESOME!!!  EVEN MORE AWESOME?  Front flipping row parking, ha!!!    Had the Daybreaker - egg white omelet with roasted turkey breast, topped w/ tomato-avocado salsa!  Absolutely fantastically wonderfully DELICIOUS!!!  It was light & flavorful & quite a bit of turkey, good turkey, not the pressed processed stuff claiming to be turkey :-)  Love their ice tea, mmm mmmm mm!!!"}
{"text":"This review will be short and sweet. I don't spend a lot of time here. It is just my morning coffee stop. The service is awesome, super friendly batistas every morning that make delicious coffee.   2 problems: parking (not enough of it) and the market is cramped and difficult to maneuver. However, I can totally overlook these things to get good coffee for cheap (if you have a tumbler to get refilled, that is)."}
{"text":"Dopetastic gluten-free, roasted corn pizza!  I went here with a friend of mine who has Celiac's Disease, so she can't eat wheat based foods.  So gluten free is her go to.  We got a couple of different pizza's here, and while the other one is not worth reviewing, the roasted corn pizza topped with laura chenel goat cheese, corn, roasted tomatoes and basil was exquisite and would make even the tone deaf's taste buds sing!  It was really good, and I didn't see that coming at all.   The vibe is pretty chill in there, there are a lot of patrons, but you can still have a good conversation, and the staff is pretty friendly and provides good to very good service.    I'm definitely going to go back and get that pizza again and try some of the other things on their pretty vast menu."}
{"text":"Pros: This airport is amazing! When I found out they had a LGO here, I had to stop by even though I had just been to the original location yesterday. Fresh squeeze orange juice and an English muffin.   Cons: no merchandise? That's my favorite part of the LGO experience."}
{"text":"So this is a place that you take your own plates to the trash. But Morgan such a kind person always seems to grab our stuff and takes it for us. It's great here I love this place. Makes my mornings better!"}
{"text":"The center of a mini-empire at 40th St. and Campbell. Good place to relax over breakfast or lunch. Try the Spanish latte. Service in the grocery is uneven (watch out for some prodigious yawning from behind the counter). Great wine selection and lots of fun things to try, though.  LGO Pizzeria next door is swell; nice to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"It's Airport food, but it is definitely above average. Very creative and delicious salads. Fast, convenient, and a nice assortment of healthy choices."}
{"text":"Boutique market, prepared foods to go, bottle shop, breakfast stop, pizza/sushi sit down dinner, sandwich shop - Well, which is it? It's all of these and more.  I've been to LGO at least 50 times and loved every different visit.   I'll have their home made granola, yogurt & fruit, before I run into work. The granola is amazing tasty fresh.  The grilled tuna and turkey sandwiches are really good, always with a side of sliced fresh fruit.  The vibe is high energy, comfortable. This staff is very well managed & efficient, everyone seems to be self directed and team oriented,  in keeping this place running like clock work. The workers have a healthy/casual glow which seems to mirror clientele - all makes for great people watching.  Every time I'm in, they have unique items to shop for,  fun packaging & vivid colors.  Really like the music mix, which is an LGO private collection. You're not going to hear this selection anywhere else.  Always a top stop, when I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Writing this review primarily to declare my love for the vegetarian sandwich. There are so many items I love at LGO, but this is my most repeated order. Soft focaccia bread holds a generous slice of havarti, roasted tomatoes, roasted yellow peppers, avocado, thin sliced cucumbers, field greens, and herbed goat cheese. This sandwich is a serious slice of veggie heaven. They serve it with a nice big hunk of pineapple. I've had it 3 times in the last week or so, and that is saying a lot since LGO is kinda a haul from my office.   Other LGO loves include the commuter sandwich with avocado. Watch out, it's ginormous. Probably could share it with someone if you don't have a huge breakfast appetite. The Tammie Coe pastry offerings are incredible. My most recent discovery is the Caramel bar.......wow. The only thing I would pass on is the brownie. Too much frosting and generally too fudgy for me...I prefer a more cake-like brownie.  The great thing about LGO since we all know the parking situation sucks... is you can call ahead and do curbside pickup. I highly recommend it, no waiting!"}
{"text":"Deli, mini grocery store, bakery, dessert, and coffee/smoothie drinks. This store has a little bit of everything, from sandwiches to sushi to breakfast food and even crepes.  Here's how it worked: order at the counter, get your receipt, walk outside or to the next room for a seat, and go back to the counter to get your order.   - Hot-pressed tuna sandwich: tuna salad on whole wheat with cheddar and a pickle on the side. YUM! Warm, tasty, and healthy too. - Lemonade: SUPER tart, it pretty much tasted like no sugar was added to it. I doused it with packs of sugar, which didn't make my meal so healthy after all.  - Red velvet cake: surprisingly moist with delicious cream cheese frosting.   Parking is limited. Food took a while to come out, but that was because it was during lunch time. Dessert crepes that some patrons ordered looked really good, so I'll have to try it the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"ughh......Ive been an LGO promoter for 10 years....no longer.  they had an excellent product when they featured tammie coe bakery goods.  the new internally baked products are just not to the same standard.......continuing the downward slide."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my niece who used to live here and an awesome recommendation it was. From the outside it looks like a little take out place but there's a restaurant and bar on the other side of the take out side. We had a Mother Earth pizza with olives, artichokes, roasted peppers, broccolini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fennel, onion and cheese and a The Rocket Man with spicy red Fresno chilis, brocollini, roasted peppers, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes. Both were awesome with plenty of toppings on a thin, crispy amazing crust.  They also have a nice wine, beer and craft cocktail selection. We didn't get to try any appetizers, salads or burgers but what we saw coming from the kitchen looked yummy. My co-worker even wants to come back every night we're here to try more from their yummy sounding menu."}
{"text":"Even in the chaos, the LGO always comes through!   I've never had anything but the french pancakes with EVERYTHING on them! So yummy, though I noticed the last couple times I have gone in they have gotten a bit stingy with the creme, honey and fruit...for the price, pile a tiny bit more on please :)   The hubs usually gets the commuter sandwich and never has any complaints. They have great OJ and iced tea!   I've never gone here to shop, I've only bought MJ potato rolls from here during the holidays, it was first come first served and I was told they would start selling them at 9 a.m. so there I was promptly at 9. When I asked the girl who was standing around handing out menus where I could find the rolls, she was clueless. She tried to give me English muffins. I told her again that I was looking for the MJ/tammie Coe dinner rolls. I get a blank stair. Then the hubs spies them in the corner behind the cheese case and just went back there and grabbed 2 dozen for us. Those rolls are a huge hit with our family!   The parking is a big fat fail.   Its a fun place, great atmosphere and tasty breakfasts!   Their pizza's are pretty fabulous as well!"}
{"text":"I'm so bummed out about this place. It used to be my favorite restaraunt in terminal 4 at sky harbor  I would walk from the A gates to the D gates just to get the mouth watering salmon salad or the Croque Monsieur sandwich. But after today I won't come back. I've walked the distance the last few times and each time being disappointed with the menu items. Apparently they have changed the items and now it's a bunch of chicken and tuna salad whatever, sandwich, salads etc. Ho hum. I still give it a three star because the service is fast and the items they do serve are ok."}
{"text":"Love this place! My absolute favorite stop to satisfy my sweet tooth. But service is a hit or miss at the counter.  Sometimes I get very nice and helpful service and sometimes I don't.  Tonight for example, I don't think it was very nice or helpful when I asked the girl helping me, what kind of cake is in the outside case and told in return that it has a label on the side, even though I held it up to show her. A simple answer of the product La Grande Orange sells would have sufficed and earned a tip."}
{"text":"Everything about the restaurant and market are delightful.  It has a euro feel with the narrow market quarters and glassed selections of baked goods and other tasty morsels.  I've stopped in several times before but never had a chance to enjoy a dinner service.  A friend and I decided to dine and were quite happy with everything.  We got a kale and quinoa salad that was enjoyed to every last bit.  We then followed up with a pizza which was so amazing it left me wondering what I actually got because I was so happy with it!  We enjoyed wine with each plate and the selection is broad for regions and open for varietals.  Basically something for everyone.  Service was spot on even though she was a new server she was prompt with responses, cordial and observant.  I'll be back most definitely!"}
{"text":"Too crowded, too trendy, food and coffee were just okay. Service was nothing special. Would have no desire to come back."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here! Funny thing is, I was in the neighborhood hiking Camelback mountain that morning and I came here later. A friend recommended it for our breakfast and it was easy to find. I got lucky with finding a parking spot and I waited for her outside the grocery entrance. It's a confusing place, at least it was for me visiting for the first time. The grocery part is fairly crowded with people ordering, shoppers and workers stocking the area. There was plenty of seating in the pizzeria side but it was all occupied. My friend and I ordered and waited in the aisle of the store. Once our food was ready, we couldn't find a table inside so we went outside, where there were quite a few. Our drinks were ready a few minutes later.  I ordered the Zuni burrito and loved it! I'm not a breakfast burrito fan, but this was great. It has tofu, potatoes, spinach, corn eggs and a side of tomato salsa. My honey latte was good too, not too much caffeine which my body appreciates. Service was friendly and fairly quick, just wish the place was bigger. I just read a tip about their gelato happy hour (half off) so I'd like to come back for that!"}
{"text":"I LOVE it here. The grocery area of LGO has so many fun, interesting little things to look and buy while you're waiting in the long line to get breakfast. I've bought several cards and little gifts for people here. Though I have come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, my favorite thing to come here for is breakfast. Be forewarned though, on weekend mornings it is ALWAYS packed. It is going to be LOUD and CROWDED and you are going to have to STAND and WAIT for a while. AKA- don't go here when you're hungover or bring a hungover individual because they will NOT enjoy it (too much hustle and bustle when you're feeling weak/sick). It reminds me of some cafes/groceries I've been to in Europe which I think makes me like it even more. All of the breakfast items are delicious. The commuter sandwich is yummy. I like it with avocado, lox, or turkey, it's good no matter which way you get it because of their amazing English muffins. The day breaker and eggs to order are other faves of mine. I like to snag a picnic table outside and eat out there. Their iced tea is also really good and they serve it with an orange slice instead of a lemon slice.. YUM. They have a great wine section too with lots of different options. And HUGE plus...they are always playing GREAT music....namely Minus the Bear...my favorite band!"}
{"text":"The reuben sandwich has a fresh bread, crisp sauerkraut, and a pretty great salty corned beef. Pizza is made on the spot with a crispy crust and fresh mozzarella. Everything I tried here has great flavor and came out tasting fresh and piping hot."}
{"text":"Great place for a bite in the airport! Food is fresh and the oatmeal power bar is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Thanks SkyHarbor for putting a great quick place like this in the airport.   It was packed as usual and La Grande Orange has the same great english muffins and homemade jams as the location on 40th and Campbell.      Nice friendly staff and a great selection.    It was the busiest place in the airport and worth the limited wait."}
{"text":"Expensive and slow..  the first time I ordered a gluten free Margherita pizza with pepperoni and it was just alright.  Second time at this airport I ordered the green Chile burger.  I asked for it cooked medium.  I was in a rush to get to my plane so I grabbed it and ran once they called my name.  Got to the airplane and went to eat my burger and the patty was so raw the middle was falling apart and my bun was soaked in blood... blood and oil was also pooling in the bottom of my box and soaking into the fries.  Wish I took a picture.  I was starving so I ate the fries that weren't touching it... I won't say don't eat here because you have limited options but have time to sit and eat or at least check your food before running off.  They also have items that don't require cooking which may be a better option and what I should have done."}
{"text":"4* only because i'll probably search for the next 10 years to find something better. sandwiches are great but i particularly love the genuine english muffins. none of that thomas's anymore. very comfortable layout too. sometimes tight but always cool"}
{"text":"I went here with my family, it was pretty good, definitely not what i was expecting as in order and get your food and grab a seat type deal. Thought there was more table service, BUT it is good how it is.  I really did like all the options and customizability (think i just made that up), for the pizzas.  This place easily could have been a 5 star for me, but the pizza didn't hit out of the park. It was a nice triple, but no home run.   Still it is one of the better pizza places in town i have visited, but not enough to overthrow the crown.   Fun place to come in the afternoon for a lunch with some friends. Very casual feel.   I like how they have a guy directing traffic in the parking lot. if not it'd be a mad house."}
{"text":"I have been to LGO a few times now and every time it's a fun and delicious experience. LGO has grown and expanded over the years including pizza next door, breakfast staples, and a fantastic bakery. My favorite things are the Havana latte and their freshly made English muffins. (The muffins just melt in your mouth - it's like nothing I've had before!) Their bakery items are fantastic as well - especially the cookies. I've ordered a birthday cake from here and it was a decadent delight. The only downside is the parking is extremely limited and it's like a madhouse trying to get in or out. Recently they implemented valet parking, which is heaven sent. Otherwise, if I lived closer, I'd be here every morning! I would definitely recommend checking LGO out."}
{"text":"I had been dreading coming to the airport and finding out that LGO had a location made me feel better. While our flight wasn't in section D, we had enough time to kill so we scrambled on down. I ordered the commuter sandwich and the Havana latte. My latte was divine - sweet and tasty.  The sandwich was so large we could have shared. Their homemade English muffins are to die for and I could have just eaten that.   My husband ordered a Caesar salad. The salad was meh. There were tons of to-go salads in the display case and my husband figured that's what they were - to-go salads. Since we were sitting down and eating he thought they would make the salad fresh and bring it out on a plate. Nope. The employee grabbed a box and handed it to my husband. There wasn't a lot of salad in the large box and the crotons were soggy from being inside the box.   Overall, the freshly made items were delicious and the bakery case was full of tempting treats. If I come back through the airport, I'll definitely be grabbing a latte and sweet treat."}
{"text":"Breakfast, you gotta have the Jersey girl omlette. Lunch, you gotta have the seared ahi tuna sandwich, but on an english muffin, not toast.  This lunch sandwich is the BEST in the city.   I could eat it every day.  Only available until 4pm though."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery, not to be confused with La Grande Orange Pizzeria, is a cool little shop that has always had its fair share of fans over the years.  Admittedly, most times I'm here because I'm waiting for a table at the nearby pizzeria and just browsing to kill time. The shop features lots of knick knacks, books, soaps, and candles. They all remind me of things that I'd buy for someone that I don't really know very well. Some items are overpriced, but that's to be expected.  Their bakery offers up some very good sweets, including their sea salt chocolate chip cookie. My girlfriend threatens violence upon me if we don't order it during our dinner visits. Their gelato, which is technically a separate company-owned brand (with their own separate Yelp account), is also pretty decent from the few times I've sampled it.  We did breakfast here once and while I didn't really like the \"order at the counter\" setup, the food was up to the quality that you'd expect from LGO - including the coffee.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent. They have a lot of options here. They have pizza, sandwiches, omelets and more. They have grab and go pre-made stuff but also have fresh, made-to-eat food that is fresh and good. I had eggs over easy with turkey and toast. I could have chosen from several other meat options. There was also a healthy slice of musk melon. Not bad for about $10.  I would go back."}
{"text":"The food for the most part is pretty good; smtimes there may be a slight variation bc they have a ton of cooks working at one time n that will mess w the consistency. What can be annoying is that after you order you have to stand around the very crowded front area wait for you name to be called or grab a table in the back and than walk back up front when you think your order is ready .. They do not bring your food to you .. I never understood that. They have curbside or car service and employees everywhere, yet customers are left standing around waiting for their orders to be called."}
{"text":"Cute little place which serves really nice sandwiches and salads. We ordered mimosas and turkey sandwiches. Crowd is hip and ambience is casual. Offers a wide range brunch and lunch dishes. Crowded on Sundays but I enjoyed my brunch date here :)"}
{"text":"Sea salt chocolate chip was better than the butterscotch oatmeal. Both were still pretty good.  The smaller cookies are $1.50 each and is a yummy snack or dessert."}
{"text":"The best margarita pizza I've ever had. Super fresh ingredients! Thin crust pizza with the perfect amount of toppings. We also enjoyed their chips and dip appetizer with salsa, cheese dip, and guacamole. If you haven't tried their wings; you need too. They are crispy with a little spice. So good! Their guacamole was amazing! This restaurant cooks with fresh ingredients leaving you happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot.  I get the croque Madame and iced tea.  Love sitting outside when the weather is nice- picnic tables in the shade.  Dog friendly, popular place after a hike up Camelback or a run along the canal.  Parking situation greatly improved when the LGO management office opened a block north of the restaurant-parking in their business lot is encouraged for restaurant guests.  I love the market- items are expensive but very unique."}
{"text":"I LOVE LGO! The place has been around for years now and it is always consistently good! The shop it's self is beyond adorable and has some great stuff that would be great gifts or a nice little something for yourself!  I have tried a little bit of everything from their menu. My favorites are the  *Smoked Salmon Salad that comes with baby spinach, arugula, basil, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, cous cous, house vinaigrette, its addictive and different and only $8.50.  *Guacamole BLT - Which has amazing thick cut bacon, fresh tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole. It's perfect and super filling. $7.25  but my serious all time favorite is their Croque Madame - broiled open-faced w/ ham, tomato, sunny-side egg, spicy mustard sauce and gruyere and a steal for $7.50!  They have insane freshly baked good - Try their homemade english muffins! You will never want to go back and and buy Thomas' English Muffins again, you will be permanently ruined! It's a great place to check out for Breakfast or lunch. It can be kinda busy at times and parking is a pain but trust me it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and loved it for a long time, but just recently the realization hit me: it's pretty mediocre. Yeah the environs are about as inviting and cutesy arcadia as they can be, and the staff and service are usually very friendly, but the food itself is unremarkable. The pizzas are either dry or overly greasy (never the happy medium), the salads are bland (a Caesar is supposed to have a little flavor beyond just \"wet\"), and the burgers often come out over cooked and dry. The breakfasts and baked goods are great, but priced high. In fact the whole thing is priced way too high for what you get. I still like the place, but cannot rave about it. And a multitude of poor food experiences over the last year or so has me looking elsewhere in the 'hood."}
{"text":"As always another great meal at LGO  great pizza chips and dips The place is so cool love coming here breakfast, lunch or dinner doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I absolutely despise really hot weather, but I would entertain the idea of moving to Phoenix just so I could eat at La Grande Orange every day. Just went to Phoenix for a business trip, and that's what I did - ate at La Grande Orange every day. The breakfast options - commuter sandwich, daybreaker omelet, granola and yogurt, cinamon rolss - were all fantastic. They know how to make a serious English muffin from scratch. Also ordered the kale and quinoa salad from lunch - perfect balance of healthy components, but I recommend adding artichokes, sundried tomatoes, and avocado to make a true meal of it. But save room for dessert -  I highly recommend the \"makes you wanna slap your momma\" carrot cake. At least LGO should consider changing the name to that. The store also has a super cute 'grocery' section to peruse - well-curated trinkets, wine, and don't even get me started on the bread."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to hit up, it's airport prices that kind of throw me off from the food. But if you come here, get the California burger, it's a pretty perfect burger from an airport food service. Fries are alright, and they don't have any fountain drinks. But other than that, it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"My first time at La Grande Orange and I really enjoyed it! I totally agree with all the other Yelpers about the parking and pricing but also that it's so worth it once you get in there and see all the cool stuff they have while you wait for your food. I just tried the new LGO Chicken Salad sandwich and it was amazing!! I'll definitely be going back for more!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Scottsdale and it's fantastic selection of gourmet fare. The mornings here bustle with the business attired crowd, yogis, and people in hospital scrubs as they wait to pick up their healthy breakfast fare.   I had the heirloom brown rice bowl which featured a soft boiled egg over a bed of rice, quinoa and kale. A smear of chili sambal type paste adorned a corner of my bowl. I also couldn't resist their blueberry scone. The free samples they give out in the morning are fantastic at enticing one to buy one of their well made pastries."}
{"text":"Good but a little overhyped. I had the commuter sandwich which would have been just ok other than the bomb homemade English muffin, which was so good I bought a pack to take home. Desserts are delicious, especially the Ooey Gooey cupcake. I'd go back for the cupcake, complimentary valet, and the awesome view of Camelback."}
{"text":"Good brews, good pizza, great cupcakes, great prices. Friendly.  We broke out the beach cruisers and rode down the Arizona canal. Great ending to a good ride. Friendly. Cool atmosphere. Always a good spot."}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised to see LGO at the Southwest Terminal at Sky Harbor.    The only thing that was an issue was where to line up to order and pay for your food. The space isn't large and what free space is left over is mostly taken up by displays; add in travelers with carry on luggage and it easily gets crowded.  Everyone seemed to congregate at the middle register. I avoided waiting in line by walking up to the clerk at the far left (empty) register to ask if it was open, which she was. Keep in mind there were 3 registers open, but the clerks at the 2 side registers weren't proactively assisting in clearing out the group of waiting customers nor were fellow customers aware that there were 2 other open registers *sigh*  Anyway after a weekend of non-stop weekend I wanted something healthy. I ordered the Zuni burrito: whole wheat tortilla with tofu chorizo; corn; spinach; potato; egg whites; and charred tomato salsa. YUM!  My favorite of all the ingredients was the charred tomato salsa. If they packaged and sold this in a bottle, I'd buy it!"}
{"text":"**La Grande Orange Grocery is attached to La Grande Orange Pizzeria**  LGO Grocery isn't your average grocery where you can stop in and get some milk and paper towels on your way home. It's more of a funky gift shop meets a specialty food store.  After me and my friend were done eating our pizza from LGO Pizzeria, we perused through the grocery. There were knick knacks (scented candles; bath products; children's toys; stationary; etc). There were refrigerated displays with specialty salads, sandwiches, cheeses, and meats.  There were the gelato counter and pastries counter and behind that was the actual kitchen where they were busy preparing food orders, other than the pizzas.   LGO Grocery offers breakfast items (pancakes, granola, eggs) along with salads and sandwiches.  My friend bought a pack of their english muffins. If I wasn't too full from the pizza I would've ordered an english muffin to try on the spot. They looked like fluffy white discs :)   The space to move about at LGO Grocery is very limited due to the counters, displays, and people in line to pay for their food orders or purchases; but other than that, the whole concept is awesome: a funky gift shop/specialty food store with an attached pizzeria offering good eats and unique gifts without any of the pretentiousness you might encounter at similar places."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a farm to table kind of vibe then look no further. I recently came here with my family. We found parking pretty easily behind the place.  We had a party of 10 plus 2 kids. We were seared promptly and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes.   The staff was very accommodating to our children. We notice that there were quite a few tables that had babies with them like us. The atmosphere was pretty loud so if the kids got a little loud you couldn't really hear them.  We ordered 3 chips with cheese and guac. The quac could've used more salt. But it was good.  We ordered 4 pizzas. One was the one with basil I think it is the margarita. I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The basil was so fresh and the flavors were so good.   We also ordered a cheese pizza with sausage added on. Again it was pretty fresh tasting. The sausage seemed to be homemade.   I didn't try any of the other pizzas.   If you are looking for a casual fresh family friendly place to eat this would be a great option."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO expensive. I couldn't believe how much a burger costs and a pizza.  I mean they were good but really, I could feel my entire army of kids with 1/3 of what we paid for both of these meals.  To make matters worse, I didn't know where the heck to pick up the pizza we ordered.  There weren't any signs or anything.  We stayed on the left side near the fridge because we ordered on that side.  We received our drinks and our burger on that side but when I asked about our pizza, the workers were looking at me oddly and then treated me horribly like I was supposed to know to pick up the pizza on the other side.  Really people.  I want to give this place even less stars but the food was actually good.  Boo to getting food at the airport and rude people."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurant options in the entire Airport. The pizza is thin crust and very very yummy. I wouldnt be able to tell that my pizza came from an airport restaurant.   Will be coming back here during my PHX layovers."}
{"text":"RE: Employee Joshua 322446's customer service skills suck. He was working the cash register on April 10th taking orders. We walked up and did not get a welcomed greeting which is basic customer service in any establishment. Instead we received a stale faced employee who obviously hates his job. He should be working the bathrooms instead of the cashier.   Besides the above, food here is great!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza, game watching, and studying. Food is awesome. Im going to nibble on this mushroom and pepperoni pizza all day."}
{"text":"Beware. Lousy food at a high price!!! What do you expect for airport food hu?  The burger was Raw, the chicken wrap turned out to be a \"chickpea\" wrap????  Ugggghh. And the fries have pepper on them. Thanks but no thanks I can do it my self IF I WANTED stupid PEPPER on them!"}
{"text":"It was an ok experience.  There was a line to order my drink.  Plenty of employees working and looking busy.  Coffee station was a bit dirty, but it was also a busy spot and a lot of people were getting coffee.  The nice thing about it was that you can go back and refill your coffee (since it was self serve)."}
{"text":"I have nothing but the best to say about LGO.  I have dined here many times and have always been pleased with my dining experience. One of my faviorite meals to get is the pizza and the salmon chopped salad.  This is a great place to meet friends and family at where you know anything you order is going to taste great."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza which was tasty but a bit greasy. The service was fast, though, which is what I wanted from an airport place. Looked to be a broad selection of menu items. I'd definitely return if I travel through PHX."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here and it was delicious!! I can't believe I didn't try this sooner. It was for a work party and boy am I glad we decided to come here! The pizza was so flavorful and simply delicious!   My only concern was the service, over all it was great but the waitress did forget my water... I asked twice, and it wasn't until our dessert that I finally got the water.."}
{"text":"The environment when you walk in is simply impressive. I had the Thai salad deliver to me at work before and loved it so I decided to go check out the place in person.   I'm the type of awkward introvert that doesn't know what to do while waiting for food after you order but I felt comfortable here because there are so many things to look at while waiting. (Cracker Barrel style shop)   Probably going back there for lunch more often now."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll be honest. I've been an LGO hater for years now. As far as I was concerned it was an over-hyped, overpriced, chi chi trinket store for people with way too much money to blow on crap they don't need. Oh, and they had some food too, but not nearly as much as they did $19 candy. And who doesn't love $19 candy??  Now, all of my previous sentiments are still exactly the same. I still think it is all those things that I did before, but they have at least upped a place in my heart (stomach) due to the best freakin BLT I've ever had. For real. Their Avocado BLT is to die for. Glorious slice of bacon stacked on top of glorious slice of bacon on top of more and more bacon. For miles. And goooood bacon. Fresh avocados, tomatoes and lettuce as well to boot. Also came with a delicious slice of pineapple on the side which was one of the ripest I've had out here in a while, so kudos to that as well.  So while I don't see myself patroning the establishment on my own terribly often, next time my boss wants to spend an exorbitant amount of money on my lunch again. I'm comin' for my BLT with open arms."}
{"text":"Every business has situations or miscommunications or whatever you wish to call it.. I don't know about you, but I rate the success or the value of a business, by its effective communication & pro-customer satisfaction style. Had a terrible sore-throat coming on & needed some soup.. Good healthy home-made soup..with quality ingredients, no GMO & all that good organic stuff .. You know...like your grandma used to make? Anyways the details of the 'situation' became quickly overshadowed by the excellent manager Casse. With her \"hand out to shake my hand, & her infectious warm smile she wanted to make me happy...100% happy. Within 5 minutes we were pals and she offered me some hot tea for my on-coming cold. Now that's how a Great Business truly helps define itself with leaders like Casse & great  people loving, craft savvy folks like Mattie & Preston just to name a few.... BTW; I had a sugar craving today while fighting my full-throttle-cold.. I chose the Key Lime... Instead of the Vanilla-bean, macadamia crusted cheese cake.. Now I'm in trouble.. 2 for 2 uh oh---check out LGO---find out why it's number-1..."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  Did take out chopped salad was not worth $11.00.  Small portion and the pizza was ice cold and was like as thin as a piece of paper maybe 3 pieces of the schrieners chicken sausage on it.  Pathetic.  $30 for that meal Are you kidding me. My girlfriend and I arent even full.  We had to go get more food.  Never ever go back.  Get your shit together!!"}
{"text":"Super good pizza! I got the avocado pizza with the cashew cheese. It was so rich and creamy, even with the cashew cheese. And the avocado was so good. My boyfriend got the one with the Fresno chiles, it was super good also. And the sour dough crust!"}
{"text":"You walk into this joint and its old school like paisa style tiendita, piled hight with nicknacks to the ceiling. Horder style hard core. Love it! There is something for everyone. Of course the Buddha want's the biggest chocolate milk he can find the the coolers and a bag of chocolate coins... Seasonal.   Oh and just in case you are wondering this spotty is Frenchie... its La Grande Orange not La Naranja Grande okay!   Breakfast here is pretty damn delish! I love eggs cooked properly and served with a hearty side of meat. LGO brought it! The english muffin that came with was so soft and delicious! Probably the best english muffin I've ever had. Note to self: grab a bag to bring home next time I'm here...  French pancakes, wow, just yum. Soft and sweet and covered in fresh strawberries. I was an instant fan.   There are a ton of treats and sweets on the menu I am killin to try. There's one sandwich i want to grub on too. Everyone raves.   They whip up a mean latte too...    Said this in my other review also, but.... If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your food on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one.   Definitely a fan of LGO Grocery."}
{"text":"I took the family here to meet up with some old college pals that I hadn't seen in some years on a recent weekend.  The visit started out strongly when we got a parking space right in front.  Score!  Timing was also good as our friends were just ahead of us in line.  We all ordered quickly and were able to find a table in the pizza area to accommodate the six of us.    This would have been a great time for us to start reminiscing and catching up, right?  Right?  Uh, except that there is no microphone/announcing system to tell you when your food is ready.  In the words of the cashier when I asked her if we would hear our names if we weren't next the food counter, 'it's not likely'.  So, unfortunately, half of us waited for the food, while the other half of us waited back at the table.  I'm certainly not asking for table service, but maybe a PA system so those eating next door or outside might be able to relax at their table before their food arrives.  Eventually, the food came out.  (Seemed like it took awhile, but I'm guessing that's partly because I was hovering around the counter).  It was...okay.  Nothing special about it, and my sandwich (turkey/cheese/avocado/etc.) did not do a very good job of staying together, it was sliding all over the place.    The highlight of the visit was that I had a faux-celebrity sighting of someone who used to be on MTV.  When that is the highlight, you sure aren't getting more than three stars..."}
{"text":"I am an LGO breakfast regular & can be found there 2-3 mornings a week most weeks. (Some weeks I am even there more.) First, I must say that when strawberries are in season, their pancakes are wonderful. When strawberries are out of season, they get a little mushy but you can always get the pancakes without strawberries & they are still really good. Also, during the Phoenix summers, their iced tea really hits the spot.   On the good side- LGO is a great place to go during the day to get work done. The internet is free. Generally, it isn't too noisy. & overall, the restaurant is pretty comfortable. The food is good & not too pricey.   On the bad side- Other people have said it before, but parking is completely inadequate. The only other negative I have is that the menu is a little limited, but I am there too much so I may be a little biased on that one."}
{"text":"Over priced and they forgot my friends pizza order, so I had to wait while mine got cold until theirs came.  Took way too long to get my drink refills."}
{"text":"This is easily the best airport food I've ever had. The kale salad was fresh, well-balanced, delicious, and filling. I could barely even believe it. If you have to get a meal in the airport, make the trek from whatever terminal you're in over to La Grande Orange!"}
{"text":"Two other women chose LGO for a business lunch last week. I was expecting something completely different. I showed up around 11:45am on a Wednesday and the place was PACKED. I had to park across the street.  The grocery area is where you order lunch. It was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons, most professionally dressed. I don't really see the appeal of coming here on your lunch hour squeezed in with everyone else.   I chose a Caesar salad from the case as I was in line. I asked the girl at the counter if I could add chicken to the salad and was told she had turkey breast. But it was sliced, lunch meat style turkey. \"No thanks\" I told her. I would have thought they would carry grilled meat to add to the salads.   Now to find a table..ugh. I snagged one as a group was leaving, I felt like a lurker. So we are there to chat with our client and eventually talk business. The techno music was so loud, I could barely hear myself or my client. Gosh, I feel like a Grandma here, but it was just not a conducive place to have a business lunch.   Props do need to go to the dessert case.  That thing was packed with amazing treats, some from Tammie Coe.  I had a mini cupcake, a white cake with a cream cheese frosting with shredded coconut on top.  It was AMAZING!  I would give LGO another chance, possibly for the pizza everyone says is so fabulous. The manager contacted me the day I went to LGO. I had sent a fellow Yelper a comment about his experience at LGO (similar to mine). She must have seen my comment and was trying to intervene before I wrote my review. I find this in poor taste. As if contacting me prior to my review will change my mind about my experience there? Sorry, no.   So many people have raved to me about LGO, maybe I went in with too high of expectations?"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of the recent T4 restaurant overhaul, and LGO is one of my favorite additions.  I grabbed dinner here before a flight last week and decided on the chickpea lettuce wraps.  My meal cost around $8 and came with two healthy and fresh wraps filled with a chickpea salad, sundried tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado slices.  Other menu options include creative salads (like the shredded kale and quinoa), fresh fruit and healthy sandwiches.    Service was both expeditious and friendly, which was a nice change from the typical surly attitude you get at airport establishments.  In my mind, this is \"as good as it gets\" at the airport - 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Decent food but the value of the product doesn't match the price. I understand it's at the airport but a take out breakfast sandwich has no business being 10.00"}
{"text":"You'd be hard pressed to find a better place that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner! Amazing food, and selection. Always alive and energy filled inside and relaxed and low key on the picnic benches outside. A must visit."}
{"text":"Came here for the Breakfast Club UYE back in August.   I had the Huevos Rancheros, and honestly wasn't very impressed. The sauce didn't have that spicy kick this dish is known for, and the eggs were cooked to the max and certainly not medium.   The English Muffin, however, was as heavenly as everyone made them out to be! Probably a good thing I didn't take a pack home.   Also, I don't see why everyone has their panties in a wad about having to listen for your name, getting up to get your plate, saving a table, etc.   Sure, I can see how this wasn't the best place for a large group. Yes, I know it's nice to be waited on. Yet, it's totally OK for us to get off our asses every now and then.   If you're claustrophobic, this might not be the place for you. It's cozy, and packed with all kinds of wine knick-knacks, books, etc. And I looove it!   Parking situation: They do complimentary valet. I was lucky enough to score a curbside spot this particular morning.   It's no secret that LGO has AMAZING pastries. Was happy to finally try one of those French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies. SO. FRIGGIN'. GOOD. Just the right combo of sweet and salty, yet buttery. Had every intention of saving half of it . . . but ate it on the way to my second training session of the day. :)   I hear the Roasted Corn Pizza is where it's at - Will definitely have to return to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood \"go to\" place, so I'm generally there at least once a week . I Stopped in to grab a loaf of bread and WOW! The bake shop has had a make-over! I was happy to see MJB take over from Tammy Coe but this approaching holiday season they are really kicking it up a notch.  New cookies, bars, cupcakes-lemon bars that are gluten free. I can't wait to find an excuse to indulge!"}
{"text":"First stop off the plane - brunch at La Grande Orange! Love that they serve breakfast all day, and there are plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Got there around 11am on a weekday, easy parking in the back.  We had the steel-cut oatmeal and stacked turkey sandwich.  The oatmeal was fine, but skimpy on the flaxseed. I asked for the brown sugar on the side. The turkey sandwich comes with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, and havarti cheese. Good, but nothing spectacular. It came with a piece of fruit. Probably should have ordered one of the infamous English muffins.  The freshly squeezed orange juice was awesome though.  Cute place, but definitely could be more organized. Stay close to the counter or you might miss hearing your number called."}
{"text":"Good food ordered the flame broiled cheese burger with fries and the guacamole BLT. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially the main location in Arcadia by Postino.   great gelato, and everything else!!  defiantly a lunch spot all day long!"}
{"text":"After an early morning mountain hikes, stopping here for fresh squeezed juice, hot-out-the-oven baked goods, and an espresso, make me a happy hiker.  Even better than all that are the gelato S here.  ...coconut or mango great on hotter days"}
{"text":"Felt sick when I ate half of a brownie yesterday after a swim.  Took a nap before work and felt ill immediately after I got out of bed to get ready for work.  For brunch today, I heated up an almond croissant and a few pieces of brownie (a piece leftover from yesterday, and broke off an edge of another.  (I also had my usual breakfast at home, organic oatmeal with almond butter and condensed milk!)  Just grabbed the corner piece and broke it apart and felt all of these  hair strands.  Decided to look for more hair in that brownie that the edge piece came from, and found more! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=NMgizfOSga2srjKRJ_PGRw  Thanks for the invite back and the \"complimentary\" brownies fresh-from-the-oven!  I've notified my friends to check their brownie slices, too..."}
{"text":"Time for an update on one of my favorite Phoenix places to eat, grab a bottle of vino or a clever gift!   This last trip I did two out of the three!  I had a delicious lunch and grabbed some gifts.  I have to say that if I owned a restaurant, it would be just like LGO.  I love this place and am always happy to be in LGO, whether perusing the wine or the groovy items in the store.  I am the MOST happy when I am eating some yummy food.  For years, I have been mildly obsessed (my friends will know I am underplaying my obsession) with the commuter sandwich.  It is so very good.  Pretty much perfection. The delicious English muffin, the eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo.  It rocks my world!   This trip, I tried something new (gasp!).  I was also so happy I did and will now have some debating to do when I am having a bite to eat at LGO.  This time I had the brown rice bowl.  I was opting for something on the healthy side.  This dish was some seriously tasty ingredients combined in a bowl.  Such great flavor!  As usual, I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix and my visit to LGO!"}
{"text":"Cute fun little place but manager/owner needs to tell the staff in the grocery section to be a little friendlier - all the women behind the counter never smiled and I seriously saw one roll her eyes at another when a women asked a question about one of their desserts! They didn't say hello or thank you just what do you want"}
{"text":"Vegetarian sandwich on sourdough. Best sandwich ever. Same taste as other location. Only thing is I like it on ciabatta bread but sourdough was good. Airport food has stepped up!"}
{"text":"As my wife and I plan our third major event (1.gender reveal, 2. baby shower, 3. BIG family b-day party), I wanted to share my absolute delight for Cole Turner, and his bake team at LGO.  As we are HUGE fans of LGOs Key Lime pie, we had hoped that they would be able to craft a gender reveal pie for us to celebrate our pregnancy. However, we weren't exactly sure what we wanted or how to make our random ideas work. Cole listened to our suggestions, and ultimately created a beautiful marriage of what he knew would be successful, from a Pastry Chef's perspective, with what we wanted our guests to experience. His ability to relate to how special we wanted this moment to be and find any way to make it work, was outstanding. When we cut into the pie, it was exactly as he described it would be, it was delicious, and it was the centerpiece to a wonderful holiday celebration.  When it came time for the baby shower, we knew exactly who to call. This time around, I gave Cole extremely short notice, and asked for dozens of miniature versions of their classic pastries. Assuming that we would be out of luck, he and his team found a way to make it work. Cole appreciated having our repeat business, and ultimately thanked us for our loyalty to LGO. But remember, we were the one's giving him the smallest of windows from which to work. I couldn't believe his dedication to the customer and their ultimate satisfaction. Once again, the desserts were 100% on point and the talk of the party. In fact, they pretty much stole the show.   As months pass between each request for their delicious baked goods, Cole is still my #1 contact for any desserts that I need catered. And each time I contact him, he remembers my name, asks about how my family is doing, and makes me feel valued. Customer service is the end-all-be-all in my book, and the bake team at LGO, led by Cole Turner gets my highest recommendation. Give them a call for your next gathering!"}
{"text":"Disorderly despite medium amount of customers. Staff give no direction over lines, bring customers in front of others with no explanation to next in line."}
{"text":"Ugh. I want to like LGO, I really do. But I've been here enough now where the hipness of the place has worn off, and all that's left is decent food at outrageous prices and a crowd like a motherf-er.   I like to order the pizzas to go, and the consistency on the time they're ready is all over the map. They say 25 minutes, I show up in 25 minutes, and the pizza has obviously been sitting there and is cold. They say 30 minutes, I show up at 20, I am chastised for showing up \"early\", then I sit for another 30 waiting for the goddam pizza. This is late nite too and totally ridiculous.  We walked over there the other day for coffee and the crowd was a nightmare. At this point, I'm just sick of it. It is actually a negative that I live around the corner and can go whenever. It would be better if it were further away and therefore an \"event\" for us to check it out.   Anyway, it's a cool place sure. I like the \"co-op\" feel and they sell some really cool beers. But it's over priced and waaaaay too hectic. I'm just over it....."}
{"text":"The Sky Harbor has many great options for food and this place is no exception. They do pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and salads. I was feeling pizza and I ordered the \"Fallen Angel\". It came with sausage, fennel, onions, mozarella and red sauce. The pizza was well cooked with a nice chew and the pizzas are single serving. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Great for odd juices and European treats. Their salads are top notch and the baked goods are delish. It's just always so darn crowded in there and it's hard to get the attention of the sometimes flippant counter staff. Great people watching. I don't see how this place has been voted good for groups, unless they're ordering out?"}
{"text":"Like this place needs another amazing review...but I'll do my due diligence.  When I go out of town my favorite thing to do is seek out the best of the best foods of that city.   Best of Phoenix gave this place the best cookie award for their sea salt chocolate chip cookie...first bite impression: Sweet n savory. Can we say delicious and best of both worlds in one ginormous cookie?!?! While waiting to ring up we saw one of the employees slice up their red velvet cake...we couldn't take our eyes off it so we asked for a piece to go, which was the best decision we made! The cake was one of the best red velvet cakes I've tasted if not THE best. The cake part was moist n soft and the icing was not too sweet...just right. The piece of cake just melts in your mouth...it was like a food orgasm! So good I said to myself I must come back everyday for a piece before I head back to the East Coast. The place is very cute and quaint and not only has bake goods and pastries but filled with neat knick knacks."}
{"text":"Had an hour in between connections.  We like Paradise better.  Ordered the cubano and it was pipping hot but the flavor is okay.  Cookies were big (peanut butter, butterscotch oatmeal) but they were not chewy."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants are usually hit or miss...but this place is a hit for me.  A simple deli style, no server cafe that serves burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches, breakfast and a variety of desserts. I got myself a California Burger (angus beef, havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions).  My first impression was that it is definitely smaller than the usual burgers served at other restaurants, but I guess that is to be expected in an airport.  With that being said, the burger was actually just the right size, very juicy and full of flavor. It also comes with  hearty side of fries. Airport priced, but well worth it.   The only thing I did not like about this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks...only bottled, and those cost $2.79 each . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for the day on business and landed around breakfast time, feeling a bit famished (the peanuts on my two-hour Sourhwest flight from Oakland were a bit inadequate). A quick glance at my Yelp app while standing in front of the first restaurant I came across - La Grande Orange - happily revealed that the very same establishment came highly recommended! \"What luck,\" I thought to myself.   I ordered a Zuni Burrito off the breakfast options helpfully put up on a board behind the counter, and waited about 10 minutes for my food, eagerly anticipating the tofu \"chorizo\" and charred tomato salsa (among other things like mushrooms, corn, potatoes, egg whites and spinach) my Zuni was meant to be filled with.   I opened up my burrito and the wrapper came apart. I have never had a burrito be served to me so badly wrapped. Never. Re-wrapping it up myself, I took my first bite, getting huge chunks of potato and bland tofu, but little else. This continued as I worked my way through this sorry excuse for a breakfast burrito, vainly searching for all the ingredients which were promised, letting out small grunts of satisfaction when I found a kernel of corn or a bit of spinach or mushroom. But it was mostly a mass of potato and tofu.   Filling, yes. Tasty, no. So if you decide to breakfast here, do yourself a favor and order something else. Not the Zuni Burrito."}
{"text":"Staff can be a bit snobby, but overall they have a delicious menu for breakfast! Definitely a cute neighborhood spot for the weekends."}
{"text":"Awesome food and if you go for breakfast I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. Expect the place to be absolutely packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner, sat at the community table and felt like our waitress was super attentive. The pimento dip and chips was amazing, and our pizza came out with a crispy, thin crust. The gelato looked so good but we were too full! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I still haven't been to the \"regular\" LGO location in Phoenix, but I liked the one in the airport.  In general, terminal 4 at Sky Harbor has developed some good restaurants, but this might be the best one once you get past security. I like that there's several options including salads, pizza, sandwiches, and even breakfast.   I had a chopped salad and really liked everything in it. It's always a little annoying to have to mix dressing (which the vinegarette here is really good!) in those plastic containers w/the salad contents, but what are you gonna do when you grab and go at the airport? I saw a woman behind the counter putting salads together so it looks like they put fresh ones out pretty often. I also snuck a piece of cheese pizza from my mom and it tasted good.   They have a couple beers on tap & a few wines to choose from. The food here seems pretty comparable in price to the regular restaurant, but alcohol is a little more (as the airport does).   I also tried the cookie with \"everything\" in it (forget what it's called) and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to grab a quick lunch on a short layover after a 4 hour flight.  After doing a quick search on where to eat inside the secure areas at PHX, I walked by to see the place was poppin with activity, and I could see people at the tables enjoying some good looking sandwiches.  What drew me in though was the alluring case pastries!  This is one of those times I wish could just pack boxes of food into my carry on luggage.  They also make pizza!!  Anyway, I got myself the Cubano sandwich...delicious!  It had a good balance of ham, pickle, cheese and the right level of toast on the bread.  Service was pretty quick considering how busy the place was especially on a prime travel day (Friday afternoon, was 5th in line to order, I was in and out in maybe 5-6 minutes...Pro tip: they have multiple registers open, look around and don't get stuck in the longer line).  Prices were about on par with other airports.  I also got a cookie for the gf picking me up at my destination.  Ate some of that, and now I wish I had gotten one for myself!"}
{"text":"Love LGO! Everything is absolutely delicious...EVERYTHING! Staff is always attentive, their key lime pie is my favorite! (And I've been to Key West just to try the original)....pizzas are so good! Can't say enough, such a great spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best tuna sandwiches I've ever had.  The bread was superb, and nicely toasted.  There was a heaping pile of tuna salad in the sandwich, with a perfect combo of tomato, baby greens, apple, and cucumber.  The tuna salad itself was divine.  The sandwich came with a gigantic slice of melon and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the sliced pickles it came with were the sweet bread-and-butter type.    While the sandwich was divine, parking was another matter.  I know you can get complimentary valet parking, but I'm never a big fan of using the valet since I'd rather just park on my own. I ended up using the curbside pickup and received friendly and speedy service.    This is definitely a new favorite of mine if I'm in the Arcadia area!  Tuna salad sandwich: $7.25  EDIT: After hearing from one of the managers, apparently there's some more self-parking spots at their accounting office one block up.  Good to know!"}
{"text":"My omelet was cold and not much to look at.   Muffin and coffee were good. Parking is limited.   Not sure I like the idea of going to a restaurant to eat and feel the pressure to buy all the merchandize they put in front of you as you walk in."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange has a great vibe and a the decor is beautiful. Service was good, i had higher expectations for the food. It wasn't bad by any means. I wasn't impressed nothing special. The little market on the side has a great selection of items. Cute place. Might return"}
{"text":"I love going to LGO after a hike...I am pretty sure I have had everything on the menu. But my go to is always the Commuter sandwich or Rotisserie Chicken sandwich, the only things I haven't tried are the sweets and I'm sure I'm missing out.   I typically order an iced tea but I needed a little more of a kick so I got a dirty Chai and boy was that a mistake! I have never had such a foul tasting Chai tea. It tasted burnt and left a bad taste in my mouth. Sam approached my table and asked if she could take anything away, I told her about the Chai and she gladly took it and replaced it with a vanilla latte (which was much better than that bitter Chai).   Sam was so sweet to go out of her way and help me and she really made a bad experience (with the Chai) a great one!   So, heads up if you love Chai (like I do) don't get it from LGO."}
{"text":"I no longer live in Phoenix, but this is one of my favorite places to eat! I am currently daydreaming about their summer corn pizza, which was a seasonal special last time we ate there. That sourdough crust is AMAZING. Also, go for the salted chocolate chip cookies! Mmmm..."}
{"text":"LGO makes the VERY BEST MOCA! I would just think the moca would be average because the food is incredible, but I now go for the moca!  The set up their is always a cluster of confusion. The service is not spectacular, although they are super friendly. I never know where to get things, silverware, cups, napkins, etc... I think if I go a few more times, I'll be giving LGO 5 stars for really amazing pizza as well as yummy deserts. And of course, my fav moca!"}
{"text":"i love breakfast. i love random general stores. I have this strange adoration for general stores. if I lived in the wild west, I would totally be the general store owner.    back to my point, not only is LGO a super awesome grocery/gadget/general store, but they have totally yummy breakfasts (and I'd imagine lunches as well!) shop a little, eat a little, it's not a bad way to spend a weekend morning!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Daybreaker- egg white omelet with roasted turkey (deli meat) and served with a side of mild salsa, diced avocado and halved cherry tomatoes. You dress the omelet yourself. $10 and a drip coffee $2.50 for a regular size- love that they allow you to refill your coffee; great when your flight is delayed, as mine happens to be!  Nothing over-the-top in flavor here, but it's a nice healthy option at the airport!"}
{"text":"Cute, hip, and with healthy options, La Grande Orange offers the hungry, tired traveller some good eats away from home.   What I was most impressed about by this place (aside from the fact it is not only a pizzeria, sandwich shop, bakery, grill, and gelato shop!!!) is that they offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options on their menu. They are well staffed and speedy.  I got their spicy chickpea lettuce wrap, which was chickpea, avocado, and sundried tomato on lettuce wraps since I was craving something filling, but healthy and not too heavy for my slightly upset tummy. Was very pleased with the size of it for the price, especially since it came with a little fruit salad! Cost me right around $8.   While waiting, I eyed other people's pizzas, burgers and fries, and baked goodies. All quality items!! Of note were their huge cookies, like the sea salt chocolate chip cookie.   Overall an amazing airport place. Would hit this place up even if it were not in an airport. Considering the prices, you wouldn't guess it to be airport food!"}
{"text":"The food is great, especially for fast food at the airport. The salad was so fresh. The lines were long but worth the weight. I think they do a great job representing the LGO. So you should go if you are in the airport."}
{"text":"Can I photoshop on 3 extra stars and give LGO Grocery 8 out of 5 stars?  This little spot was one of the highlights of our visit to Phoenix.  We visited 3 times and for 3 different experiences.  Just be prepared for some peak crowd times because this business is certainly no secret.    1.  We were on a long walk and dove in for some quick drinks.  They have an excellent assortment of options that are sure to meet your needs!  I grabbed my first swing at charcoal juice.  Interesting to say the least and my friends enjoyed everything they had too!  2.  We came in at another time for coffee!  Yep, nailed that too!  They do a fantastic job with A+ drip options or wonderful coffee options like our Mocha and Cappuccino!   3.  Saving the best for last here.... Listen closely.  Order a Salmon/Egg/Avocado/Tomato breakfast sandwich on the English Muffin.  *insert mind blown sound*  Yep, one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever eaten.  Silly good.  Next time I find myself in Phoenix, I will be visiting again for sure!"}
{"text":"I pulled into the parking lot and parked out front of the restaurant in the to go parking... immediately an employee ran over and told me I could not park there I had to go out and around the restaurant to park. I said to her but this is the to go section. She explained that it was only for online orders. There was zero cars parked in this section mind you. She was very rude and adamant that I move my car so I told her I was going to go in and order my food. I went in and ordered my food and told the cashier about the lady outside in the parking lot and she told me to just park there it was not busy and that the food would be ready in 20 minutes. So I went back out to my car and this woman came up to me again telling me I had to move and all the time the to go parking never once filled up tons of open spaces. So she tells me she is going to get her manager I said ok. So the manager comes out and tells me that the parking is only for online orders and I asked her what is the difference they r all to go orders. And she said she did not want to argue with me that I could park there. I am a customer I car spent my money same as the rest of the customers why were these ppl being so rude. So I waited and waited it ended up taking 30 minutes for my food and all during my wait I was being glared at, ppl were rolling their eyes at me. And in general just being rude and haughty. Is this the way u treat all my customers and how do u have a business. During my wait I noticed that the girl outside who was my initial rude person seemed to be flirty and al over this man which I thought was weird since she was at work, and then I saw this man come out the door. He said my name and I said yes. He said here is your food and please don't come back bcuz you r disrespectful and don't obey the rules. I was completely aghast... so he has a thing for this young woman, this man and I'm assuming some sort of manager. I have never had anyone any group of ppl be so rude. I spend so much money in restaurants every day. And I never yelp if I could have given them a zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options from healthy to decadent. I love the ginger cookies here. They are chewy and a lot of real ginger flavor. Great coffee and lots of choices to try. They have a croissant with ham and cheese baked inside they way you can get in France.  This place switches over to a pizzeria at night. I have to go back and try that."}
{"text":"Get the English Muffin!  Freshly baked and amazing!  Get anything with an English Muffin and you'll be happy.  If you happen to be allergic to wheat or gluten, don't get it- it will make you feel bad.  Get something else instead."}
{"text":"I've only been to the regular one once, but the one at the airport, multiple times. This place is a great solid choice for almost any type of person, regardless how picky they are.  Very popular local choice!   I'll be back again next week!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.  I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.  I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."}
{"text":"I worked with Cole in creating a GF dessert spread for an event held last weekend. The entire process - from the initial order, through editing to delivery was smooth and professional. Not only did he deliver personally, but he brought along the Chef. Desserts exceeded our expectations, and we will absolutely be using and recommending their catering services in the future."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try LGO for some time now, and made plans to have it for dinner before I flew out last week. I found it at Gate D and was pleased at all of the stations and options they have - I'm pretty sure they offer their full menu, or pretty darn most of it. I had a glass of wine and the Gladiator pizza, and I grabbed a cookie for the flight. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to be ready and I had to wait for it to cool down since it was piping. I really enjoyed it and their sourdough crust is a unique touch. My experience makes me definitely want to make it out to their restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the best experience at the airport LGO....far superior than the 50+ experiences I've had at the 40th street location.  The staff at this location are amazing, very attentive and provided excellent customer service...specifically Steve who made sure my order was just right after I made a request at the register.  It's hard to make an airport experience great, but they did it!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 3/5  This place is really cool. They have counter service where you can order sandwiches and breakfast items (the turkey sandwich is fantastic), a pizza and sandwich restaurant (the pizza is absolutely delicious), roast chicken (whole or half), a coffee bar, an alcohol bar, and some pastries and gelatos. So whether you're in the mood to sit down, bring a chicken home, or just grab a quick bite or beer, La Grande has got you covered. I also HIGHLY recommend the pizza with chicken sausage.  The negatives are as follows: (1) the portions are very small for the price. The chickens are bursting with flavor, but easily the smallest roast chickens I have bought. The pizza also really feeds only one person, but is in the mid-teens per pizza.  (2) Parking. I typically disdain Yelpers that focus on parking, but it is so extraordinarily bad here that I have to bring it up. There are roughly 25 spaces and no street parking. A lot of these spaces are also short-term parking, which makes it extremely difficult when you want to do the pizza restaurant. They occasionally offer valet - but there is no seeming rhyme or reason for when they do or don't. And there are two small parking lots that don't share access, so you have to constantly enter and exit busy streets to go between them whilst looking for parking. For as popular as this place is, they really need to come up with a better solution to parking."}
{"text":"Finally, I had gotten a chance to have dinner here.  The valet parking has always detoured me from going to LGO.  I have the cheese pizza and tried the kale salad.  The cheese pizza had a lot of flavor, there wasn't a ton of sauce but it was really tasty and the crust was crispy.  It took awhile to get our food but the service was good and having good conversation with friends made it worth the wait.    I will have to come back for breakfast.  i do love your muffins!"}
{"text":"Get the Commuter Sandwich!!! SOO GOOD!  I love this place- it's always busy, but they move quickly and the staff are always friendly.  I got really excited when I saw that they are opening an LGO at the PHX airport!"}
{"text":"Yum! Cute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. One of my favorite concepts. You can buy cards here, shirts, salads, wine, cheese, soda, gelato, pizza, cookies, sandwiches, coffee, kids toys, beer, and gemstones. The epitome of Arcadia yuppie hangout, I aspire to be able to eat here every day and wear more lululemon at the same time."}
{"text":"Ooo yes, me likey.  After a super long flight and arriving in hot and steamy Phoenix, Gabi whisked me away to La Grande Orange Grocery, and I must say her decision was spot on. I had no idea what to order from their expansive menu (I never know whether to order breakfast food or lunch food at places like this!) but once I saw a croque madame it became the only option.   Things were bustling around this cute little spot, selling various wares to whoever might really feel the need for a cute whisk or a new card game. I witnessed a woman making fresh grapefruit juice, and despite not liking grapefruit I was tempted to order some for myself. I was quite pleased with my sandwich, secretly happy it was lighter than some of the other croque madames of my past; slathered in various types of sauce and piled high with meat and cheese. No, this portion was perfection: filling and certainly sinful without being over the top."}
{"text":"What can I add this place rocks for so many reasons...  If you are a vegetarian get the Zuni burrito (whole wheat tortilla filled with tofu \"chorizo\", corn, spinach, egg and served with salsa) it is delicious!  The French pancakes w/ honey, fresh fruit and cr√®me fra√Æche are fantastic (think crepes)!  Order at the coffee counter, it will save you a ton of time.  Sipping a latte and people watching absolutely rules here."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this restaurant. The pizza is amazing. Oh and the Kale salad to die for. There is an attached shop with baked goods and the salted chocolate chip cookie is delish. Must try."}
{"text":"I don't really need to say much...just a really cool Arcadia staple that has a little of everything.  It's pretty busy every day all day so obviously people are continuing to go for a reason"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST tuna salad in the Salad Nicoise that I have EVER tasted!!  And possibly the best airplane meal I have ever experienced.  This is no tuna from a can - its in nice big pieces with just the right amount of creaminess.  I loved the added golden raisins and the dressing.  The salad comes with kalamata olives, par-boiled green beans, tomatoes, half a (perfectly cooked) hard-boiled egg and a side of green leaf lettuce.  This salad along with a glass of red wine ordered on the flight and I was in heaven!  Great for taking on the plane too - its so fresh, no one will know you are eating tuna and its not at all messy.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow,it's been over a year since I have come here.  What in the world was I thinking?  I forgot how much I liked the unique and tastey sandwiches here.  After a long grueling Camelback Mtn hike my friend said we should come here for a bite.  Glad I agreed to and that part.  My muscles everywhere on my body were hurting, but that sandwich made me forget all about them as we sat on the patio.  I know parking is a nightmare on this corner in Arcadia, but who cares about that.  Great place to people watch and enjoy great food at the same time.  I definitely won't wait another year until my next visit."}
{"text":"Had the Zuni burrito, which is a vegetarian burrito with tofu, spinach, potatoes, and eggs and it was delicious. Their salsa is mild and fresh. I really liked the taste of all of it. I would recommend this is you are at the airport traveling. Their service was nice and received my food fast."}
{"text":"Obnoxious establishment with no parking, lines out the door, overpriced iced tea and snotty staff. I go here because my daughter begs me.   And so we go. On three separate occasions my go to Sonoma salad actually smelled. Rank. Disgusting. I can still taste it.   So now the only food item I can find as a \"go to\" or as a \"to go\" is the tuna salad. I really like it. But the increased price and decreased amount in the container make the only thing left of any value at LGO unaffordable.   So if you have plenty of time and money and don't care about value you might want to try LGO's tuna."}
{"text":"LGO used to be our go-to spot on weekends for coffee and a light breakfast.  Over the last year or so the place has changed.  They no longer carry the good pastries (Tammie Coe) and the portions are smaller and not that great.  The prices however are still way high."}
{"text":"Look, this is just fine as a great neighborhood family spot, but it clearly fails as a destination (see parking complaints).  A friend and I used to go here on Saturdays/Sundays after hiking Camelback because he lived in the area.  While I would never travel from afar to go here, I have to admit that I want one near me.  They absolutely get it right, handling a huge volume of brunch orders on weekends and keeping it all moving relatively smoothly with always good food.  Nothing exciting, but good.  Note: the core demographic seems to be shifting to more and more young parents like ourselves.  So I wouldn't advise bringing your hangover here to encounter the screaming babies.  Also, please don't glare at me over the rim of your paper coffee cup because I look like I just went hiking.  It's a freakin' grocery store with a cafe in it!  Get over yourself."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the portion size was way off for the price. It was a small hamburger and it was $12 and I mean a small hamburger. Don't get the burgers there. You'd be better off with one of their sandwiches. I suspect it will be prepared faster than the burger which took 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza... Corn, veggie, avocado?! How do I choose!?!? Amazing crust. Amazing pesto. Amazing quinoa salad. Amazing !!!! Nutella gelato. 4 stars because the service. It's well known the girls on the order side don't have the best ...er...customer service. But I will eat their attitudes and lack of menu knowledge with an avocado pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Happy faces. Positive vibe. If you have any bit of a sweet tooth you will love the baked goods. The rotisserie chicken is unreal. The coffee is stellar. Parking sucks, but once you find a spot it'll have been worth the wait. The adjoining pizza spot is awesome. Nothing bad to say about this place, they always treat me well and I have never left unhappy."}
{"text":"Super neat place. My first visit was quite impressive. A little quirky, this place has a little bit of everything. Met some friends for lunch at 11:30 and it was already busy. They have FREE valet parking and inside & outside seating. Breakfast all day, coffee bar, fresh pastries and MORE! Also some neat and unusual gifts are available. NICE!"}
{"text":"LGO is definitely my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. Oh who am I kidding...dinner and dessert as well! My favorite thing to do is to come in on a Sunday morning after the hectic activities of the weekend, and enjoy a delicious breakfast in their trendy atmosphere. Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!  I love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.  LGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for your order, as the lines as always very long on the weekends. It's a fun place to grab some unique gifts for your friends!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots.  Excellent place for a business meetings.  Love the fresh squeezed grapefruits."}
{"text":"The best cappuccino EVER! It has a wonderful full flavor espresso that's perfect. You can also purchase beans from Mr. Espresso and Roc.  The store is super cute with all types of gift ideas, and the list of fun food is endless: English muffins, ginger cookies, key lime pie--to name a few on the top of my list. Foodies, you will be in heaven here.  The parking might be a little annoying but the place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My all time fav place! Great , fun place. Want beer , wine ,and dessert to go?! Food has always been outstanding huge fan of the roasted corn pizza ADD avocado! I like the option of dine in or out ! Fun time for first date or ladies night ."}
{"text":"Holy -god damn it - batman - rock n' roll I love LGO.   Even when this bish is rocking hard on a Saturday morning and I'm yanked cause parking here is an absolute cluster (not their fault they kick ass and everyone wants to mow here) I find it feasible to commandeer a table, get coffee/hot chocolate and get my scrumdiddliuptious nummers nom nom'd.   I highly recommend eating a Tammie Coe pastry while waiting for your food.  She makes a crumb bun that will make you weep.  The thing is a religious experience, I swear.    FYI there is no waiter service till 4:00PM."}
{"text":"Not your typical nasty airport food, great quality, fresh ingredients really amazing, delicious food."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quinoa and chopped kale salad.   It's already in a plastic to go container, so you can grab and take if you don't have time.   They do have Siracha hot sauce and Tabasco on the way out if you want to spice it up.   My salad with tax was $10.29."}
{"text":"I came to this trendy marketplace/restaurant after an incredibly unsatisfying meal. It did the trick in satisfying my hunger but was far from perfect.  The servers were all extremely friendly and were accommodating as I ordered a lettuce-wrapped green chile burger and subbed green beans as my side. The burger itself was average and the chiles didn't pack much flavor other than intense heat. I didn't hate it but it wasn't anything to call home about. The green beans were tossed in garlic olive oil and were outstanding - win for Team Orange!  Needless to say, I ordered a drink to accompany my entree and went with the a tasty $7.25 house IPA the server recommended. When I initially asked the server what drinks they had she told me about their beer selection. I only found out *after* paying for my IPA that they had $5 glasses of wine. When I politely (I promise, I was nice) brought it up with her she said, \"oh, I just don't like wine myself so I don't really think to tell people about it.\" I didn't think a drink selection could be so complicated. I know that this is a small gripe, but it's annoying for a penny-pincher like me.  Overall, I'd be willing to give La Grande Orange one more go if I'm back in the PHX terminal."}
{"text":"Great food, but minus a star for the staff. The cashiers here are lazy, if you're in one line and it is long ask if someone idle can help you, you can order from all registers, they won't flag you down."}
{"text":"I like the idea of it, I like the brunch. They are two seperate entities crammed together, though. I feel that maybe showcasing some specialty cheeses in a dish or two, having a more seasonal menu, etc would totally improve the experience.   The \"stuff\" they sell is also a bit unrelated, a bit more sophisticated than a Spencer's or perhaps Urban Outfitter's table of funny junk and coffee table stuff. I half-expect to see a bobble-head Jesus next time I go in. Everything plays to a niche. It seems theirs is yuppie parents who revel in the novel aspect of wooden toys from France, and paying full-price for hardcover books for their toddlers.    I was excited about the Honeysuckle soap they had out the first few times I went in, but I falsely assumed they restocked stuff like that, thus missed out. It was actually the only reason I dragged my friend in the last time. At 10+ dollars, perhaps it was a blessing that it really is nothing like a grocer at all.  My friend also pointed out that the breads would be really interesting/a possible future purchase if they were not stored in open air baskets next to the food pickup area."}
{"text":"This place it cool!  I stopped here for the first time last Saturday with my husband to grab some lunch.  It was a little overwhelming at first.  Parking was a bit confusing since valet seems to have claimed a majority of the lot, but after idling around for a few moments I was able to grab a prime spot right in front.  It was very busy!  There was a line of people trickling out the door, waiting to place their orders... but before we reached the counter our order was taken by a woman with a clipboard.  It was a bit rushed so we didn't feel like we had enough time to fully look over the menu.  I decided on the French pancakes (crepes) with fresh cream, honey and fruit and my husband ordered a pizza (which is tossed up next door).  My food was ready almost immediately so I grabbed my plate and we sat next door in the pizzeria.  It took a little while for the pizza to cook (which is expected) but by then I was nearly done with my meal... still, it was delicious.   We'll be back soon, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich for my husband (the Cuban) and I had a perfect salad. I have lots of food allergies and the gal who took my order even turned around and made sure the other lady that was going to make my salad did it correct. Perfectly fresh and fast. Very appreciative!!"}
{"text":"It's airport food - but better than other options. The OG is obviously WAY better but compared to the ones around it, it's a 5 star. Pizza, sandwiches, not many \"kid friendly\" options but there is Mommy Juice {aka wine} which makes travel days with littles more bearable."}
{"text":"I had a flight delay and wandered around until the pastry case caught my eye. I ordered the smoked salmon salad. It was pre arranged. I was shocked at how amazingly delicious it was. I want to fly back just to eat it again.  I got two cupcakes for dessert (because that's how I roll) and they were not as impressive. I had red velvet and coconut and both were bland and dry.  Next time I will try a scoop of gelato. I miss you salad...."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic piece of red velvet cake from here the other day! I love the store and the unique selection of items. While it is a little pricey, the quality and taste is amazing. I have also had their english muffins and highly recommend you grab some for home! So glad yelp introduced me to this place. I will be back to try more goodies and some pizza. The girl at the service counter was very nice and quick in getting our order."}
{"text":"I had the green chile burger and my folks split a couple pizzas just this evening at le grande orange.  The pizzas were great and I love having mirror pond pale ale on tap.  The burger unfortunately did not live up to the hype.  Having just read an article about how this burger was the number two \"gourmet burger\" in town I came in with high hopes which were not reached.  I do not like burgers that fall apart and by about the third or fourth bite I was struggling to keep the thing together.  I had the freshly made english muffin for a bun and that may have been the mistake.  While the muffin is probably fantasic with some jam and butter, it did not work for the burger.    On my way out I grabbed a couple cookies and a strawberry cheesecake.  Both make up for any trouble I had with the burger.  I will be back to this place again, just not for the burger."}
{"text":"Airport food can be so hit or miss.  This place was a hit!  I went with the green chile burger.  When I received the burger, it seemed a little small.  But at the end of the meal it was the perfect size.  The chipotle aioli was delicious.  I even got an extra side to dip my fries.  If you get stuck in the PHX airport, this place will solve your hunger."}
{"text":"Note to self: GO HERE the next time I'm peckish and waiting out a hellish Phoenix layover. La Grande Orange offers fresh food, lots of veggie options, and a friendly, efficient staff. There's also great seating for people watching, and a fantastic beer list that offers various local choices."}
{"text":"Stupid a layout for coffee . All they do is sell u an empty cup and then point you to a corner to fill it Only room for 2 people and if they decide to mix it there, you are acrewed. Stupid stupid stupid"}
{"text":"My favorite airport restaurant, and I work for the airlines. Get the kale quinoa salad and the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. Pizza here is also delicious."}
{"text":"Love that I can enjoy the awesome food even at the airport, but it is not as tasty as the restaurant in the city"}
{"text":"The west entry has you walking through the kitchen and watching all the food being made, which is a really cool experience. It feels very cheers-like and welcoming. The front store is host to a wide array of niknaks and goodies. The menu is HUGE with salads, sandwiches, pizza, sushi, dessert and a slew of other goodies. There is literally something for everyone. I am a huge fan of their premade salads and if this place were closer I could easily pop in everyday for one. One downfall is the parking, it is a bit tight and if you go during a busy time you may have to valet or park further down the street and walk. All in all this place is an easy favorite."}
{"text":"I use to enjoy coming here, but it seems like the food has gone down hill slightly for the price.  The english muffins are great if you don't have the time/patience to make them at home, good for a quick fix.  The last time I stopped in the pastry was dried out and the coconut cupcake was partially frozen.  Also the coffee wasn't hot and the bar girl had an attitude when I asked if she had any newly brewed.  Nothing verbal just a snippy push of an airpot in my direction.  They have tried to improve service, still some mistakes on take away, ie; wrong pastries.  Parking is insane as it has been for several years.  I think they should get rid of one of the retail displays and allow just a tad more room in front of the coffee bar.  I thought a fight would erupt one day recently when the place was packed and there was a girl waiting to get coffee and her friend asked if she was ready, she replied that if she would be if people would stop hogging the coffee bar.  I thought she was being funny and must know the guy in front of her, but by his look when he turned to look at her, I realized they weren't together.  I waited for the verbal burst of profanity, but none came and I applaud his patience with the uppity little wannabee.  I've had better, but I am here and there aren't too many other alternatives for counter service.  One suggestion for LGO, please use biodegradable take-away containers."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I had the pizza for the first time...  OH MY  GOD ....  Generally I try and stay away from :hype: items, but their pizza is KILLER. Like, just the cheese... was AH-MAY-ZINGGGG!!!  Also, the iced tea is so freaking good. I love that they put oranges in it, and you can actually get the loose leaf tea they use while you are shopping!   On a Sunday evening, the place was busy but I was able to find parking and they were taking orders at three different counters, so it was much more efficient than usual :)"}
{"text":"Significant issues today.  Busy restaurant with low staffing. Lack of any organization.  At some point regulars won't wait or come back."}
{"text":"We attempt to hit LGO up whenever we are in Phoenix for an extended stay. We are obsessed with their Commuter sandwich that has lox, egg, and tomato on their incredible, made in house, English muffins. I've never had a better English muffin. You can buy a sleeve of them (I rarely do, only because i know I'll eat the entire sleeve in a week by myself!)   On our most recent visit we shared some French pancakes, which were  crepes with a fresh creme and syrup topped with strawberries. They were savory with the perfect amount of sweet, not over the top.  I also grabbed a carrot cake to go. Yum. Reminded me of an Ina Garten recipe I've tried which includes pineapple! Attention carrot cake fans- try it!   The atmosphere is always loud and bustling, but our food surprisingly doesn't ever take that long to get. And we always manage to find a table. Staff are on top of it with the table bussing.   Service is friendly and patient. Atmosphere is hip and casual. The gift shop items are adorable, great place to bring out of state guests for good food and a great spot to pick up souvenirs."}
{"text":"Oh La Grande.. je t'aime.  This is almost a weekly Saturday morning ritual for \"The Better Half\" and I. Wondering why she's my better half? Because she introduced me to breakfast at LGO of course. The perfect place to sit and enjoy your morning, if you are lucky to find a seat. Since were talking rituals we practically order the same thing every single time. Not that everything else doesn't look amazing but because what we order is so damn good to deviate from.  * The Commuter Sandwich - Seriously the most heavenly breakfast sandwich known to man. Eggs, Tomatoes, Cheese loaded on LGO fresh made english muffins. Side note: If they served english muffins in heaven, they would be catered by LGO.  * Chilaquiles - I know what you're thinking...\"Chilli-who?\" This is a traditional Mexican breakfast dish with a lil LGO flair. Don't make the mistake of passing up this dish. Do your palate a huge favor.  * Havana Cafe - This latte makes my tummy cry tears of joy!  My only complaint is the parking. Which seems to be common among the area. On Saturdays you might find yourself circling the area to find a spot. Don't let it stop you!"}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich is fabulous!!! Definitely visit this place!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally reviewed this restaurant instead of their airport location. The airport location was amazing and delicious with a ton of vegan, gluten free options. If I'm ever in Arizona, I will definitely check out the regular restaurant."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite airport simply because of this cafe. I didn't think I would find both vegan and gluten free options at an airport but this place has it all. The food was delicious, reasonable prices, great service and so many options. It was such a blessing to be able to sit down and enjoy a nice, hot meal.   I had the Zuni burrito (no egg, no tortilla). It had tofu, potatoes, spinach and mushrooms. It was hot and scrumptious and only $7.75. I also decided to try the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wrap which had two pretty big sized lettuce wraps topped with mashed garbanzo beans made with olive oil, red onions, celery, red bell pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. It was all topped with fresh avocado and sundries tomatoes. It was only $7.50.   I also loved that this place had lots of sit down seating. You just get in line to order, then they call your name. There were several lines with different options. There was a pizza station (with vegan and gluten free pizza!), a sandwich/ salad line, breakfast food/burgers and this place even had a coffee bar with specialty drinks and baked goods (I didn't see vegan/ gluten free baked goods). I will definitely try to get more layovers at this airport so that I can eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"Best airport food ever located in the D Gates for Southwest. If you have time, it's worth the walk.   I've been to the La Grande Orange restaurant in Pasadena and it was amazing.   This airport version was just as good. The Kale and Quinoa Salad is sooooooo good!   And their juices are fresh too!   Couldn't say anything more awesome.   The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Good place. They have fresh made and off the shelf options. Got a tuna melt and a veg sandwich: both were good and had unique flavors, like the pungent herbed goat cheese on the veg and the strong pickle in the tuna salad. Nice atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"This place could standalone as a great breakfast/brunch spot, but the adjoining pizzeria and self-contained grocery store send it over the top!  It was as if I never left Seattle walking in.  A coffee stand to the left, pre packaged salads and sandwiches in a to-go area on the right, and a huge wall to wall menuboard full of breakfast, brunch, salad, drink, and bakery goodies!  I ordered the croque madame with prosciutto and thought it was very good.  The egg white on the over easy egg was a little undercooked, but the prosciutto was really the standout of the dish.  Thicker than normal cuts with great flavor added the much needed salt to the open faced sandwich.  I really enjoyed the sweet pickles accompanying the sandwich.  The parking situation is pretty rough, especially on a weekend.  I was able to snag the last spot in a \"25 minute\" area knowing I'd pretty much be in and out.  They also have several spots in the front of the store for a \"drive-in\" type service.  You park, somebody comes out to take your order, delivers your goodies, takes your payment, and sends you on your merry way.  Cool concept for those on the go!  They had a check-in offer to receive 50% off a scoop of their gelato that looked delicious, but I already had plans for a frozen treat following LGO."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever! Ive only ever really ordered the pizza and it's amazing!! One of the best vegan cheeses on a pizza you can find around town. Most places use the same old vegan cheese brands but LGO actually makes their own cashew cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to wonder, has LGO devolved into mediocrity?  It seems as though they are resting on their laurels, but their laurels are starting to get a little faded and worn.  I probably visit here more than a lot of people, as I live in the neighborhood.  I've been witness to the gradual decline of LGO from their past greatness for many years.  Oh, sure, they no doubt have more life left, but unless somebody wakes up down there, I see failure in their future.  A long-drawn out decline until people start saying \"LGO?  That's so 2000, nobody wants to be seen there anymore..\"    So, anyway, they have a great little garden patio that is perfect for sharing a growler with a friend while you people watch. Just drag your growler into the bar, get a couple of glasses and set yerself up.  There are tables along the front, but I would avoid them as the people picking up pizza and pulling in, headlights glaring can't be bothered to turn them off, or even shut the engine off.  They are too busy texting or something.  Head for the garden and grab a table.  You can even bring your well-behaved dog.   I like to order the wings to go with my growler, and in the past, I've been known to judge other wings against this gold standard.  These wings are always big, meaty and slathered in a delicious spicy barbecue sauce.  Last night I was tremendously disappointed.  When I picked up the wings, yes, they looked wonderful as always.  When I sat down to eat, though, they were cold.  Not sitting in the window cold, but cold inside.  It was quite evident from the lack of char or grill marks that these wings only made a cursory stop at the grill before being slathered in sauce and sent to the window.  I'm not sure I could even try it again.  If the kitchen thinks it's more convenient to pre-cook the wings, and send them out still cold from the refrigerator then more power to them.  I can't begin to tell you what an offense to these poor birds that have sacrificed so much this is.  Dry.  Chewy.  Cold. lame.  And please.  Don't message me and say how sorry you are and invite me back for free wings.  I don't think I could even.  Now, if you could tell me that you will change your preparation, I might be able to reconsider.  If you told me that  you pre-cook for the day's service only and subsequently allow these wings the luxury to gain the crispy, burnt-edge char that comes from enough time basking on the grill, bathing in that delicious. spicy barbecue sauce, I might be able to reconsider.  If you could tell me that those 6.5 chickens that sacrificed their limbs for my dining have not done so in vain, but that you indeed honor and respect the sacrifice they have made and you fully intend to be worthy of bestowing that respect and honor, I might be able to reconsider.  Your call.  On a high note, though, the Growler is still a kick-ass deal filled with a great microbrew."}
{"text":"After listening to a co-worker rave about the huge salted chocolate chip cookies for weeks, I decided I had to make the voyage. Convinced a friend to meet me there for lunch where we split a tuna nicoise salad (really excellent, super tasty tuna salad) and mushroom pizza (better than average). As we were eating, we noticed several patrons walking by with large cups of iced green tea that looked like they would make a good companion to the real mission of our voyage, the BAKED GOODs.  Accompanying our perfectly brewed tropical iced green teas we inhaled the salted chocolate chip cookie and Camelback bars. To take home: I got a bag of mini cookies (snickerdoodle, peanut butter and mini salted chocolate chip) and a slice of red velvet cake. She got a few macarons including a white Foxberry macaron! All scrumptious.  Next we will try the gelato and brunch offerings."}
{"text":"It's a little overrated - but as another reviewer wrote, it's very much like something you would find in California... with a pizza joint attached. I actually think their sandwiches are shitty in the grocery section and their prices suck, but it's nice to have something like this place in town. It keeps the people it attracts from wherever I like to go - kinda like fly paper for yuppie scumbags.   Actually I think they did a pretty good job with it and I wish it wasn't so packed all the time. I can see why it's so popular. Parking is a nightmare and waiting in line blows. There's nothing I could say that hasn't already been said, but I just wanted to post my score and add my 2 cents."}
{"text":"I just love that there is an LGO in the airport now. I always get the day breaker omelet. Delicious every time! And even though this place is always slammed busy they push the food out pretty quick. Good coffee too.  Bathroom is right next door in case you need to make a pit stop before the flight. Last note, the larger tables have outlets in one or two of the corners so you can charge up while you eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my weekly treat, a Rotisserie Turkey Salad. I live for this salad. I got home and   realized it was missing a few of the showstopping ingredients: avocado and bleu crumbles. I emailed them to let them know the salad was delicious as usual but sadly missing a couple of things. Within MINUTES of that email they reached out to me and sent me a lovely coupon to use on my next visit.  This place is so delicious they could have done nothing and I still would have been a loyal patron but I really appreciate this level of customer love. I'm LGO for life."}
{"text":"During my 5 day stay in Phoenix where I ate in 15 places that ranged from dives to 5 star restaurants, my lunch at La Grande Orange was the favorite.   The bustling lunch crowd, the tight quarters, the booming sound system, the servers screaming out orders, the merchandise displays all cause sensory overload.   This place has more than a mere deli counter could possibly provide.  Like: sandwiches, sushi, salads, fresh made pizzas, pastries, beer & wine, etc...  I ordered 5 different items and all were absolutely delicious.  I'm a 5th generation NY'er from Manhattan.  Snide about food.  And I'd rather eat here at La Grande Orange than 120 year old Katz Deli on the lower east side.  Yeah La grande orange is that good."}
{"text":"A must eat in Phoenix, not just for the food, but the experience. It's a grocery store slash dinner or delicatessen (lunch) and a gelato shop in 1! And it's all so good. Their wings are to die for. Not breaded, baked in a delicious sauce and then you can smother it with your favorite dressing. I prefer blue cheese. Their oven baked pizzas are really good too! The best part of LGO is the gelato. All of their favors are delicious and made fresh at the store. The best part is its really affordable compared to the chain gelato shops in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The only reason why this is a 4 star and not a 5 for me is during lunch they become more of a sandwich shop. Their delicious pizzas and wings are only served at dinner."}
{"text":"I will give this place it's props.    A lot of healthy options.     We got the chicken Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza.    The pizza was awesome.    The salad was great.   Fast and on the spot service.     Expensive though."}
{"text":"I love this place.  From breakfast to lunch everything I have tried I would get again.  Burgers, pizza, bagels and eggs.  All good.  Fun atmosphere but crowded.  Just the way I like it.   Good people watching.  Not a place to take the old folks.    I have been back 2 times."}
{"text":"The quality of the product put out by La Grande Orange in the last few months has gone steadily down hill. At least a few times a month I stop in for a morning bun most often or other pastry or dessert but they've either got a new baker, changed their recipes or have a new food vendor because the final product doesn't taste the same or look the same. It's very disappointing. I got a morning bun again this morning and it tastes terrible, the bottom fell off in my hand, doesn't taste like cinnamon, and was not light and flaky like the morning buns of the past. I got married in early April and we spent a lot of time and money at LGO and we had multiple food items come out out wrong or cold, I had the croquet Madame one morning with our guest and it came out so cold the cheese looked almost transparent from being melted and then cooled again. So my guests ate and then I ate alone once my food arrived again, this time with just one egg when the first one had 2. Our guests also commented that while they LOVED the place and the ambience the music was simply too loud for a morning gathering. Overall, while this place is truly wonderful and has great employees the lack of consistency and loud music are what give it such a low rating. Hope that it eventually improves but for now I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"After a lull in service and food quality, I think LGO is back on target!  Some of my favorites are the commuter with ham (add cheddar), tuna nicoise salad and the tuna salad sandwich. I use the curb-side service weekly to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast in the valley.  All the food tastes great as well as the coffee and fresh juices.  I would recommend the place to anyone who has some time to spare for a long breakfast since there could be a little wait to get your food they are usually really busy but friendly service.  They have a shop in the front where you can browse through food, wine, cloths, and gifts.  Its a cool place try it out!"}
{"text":"I purchased the yogurt parfait with granola while awaiting a flight. I have eaten numerous parfaits over the years, and this had to be the best. The yogurt was neither sweet nor tart, the fruit was abundant and fresh, and the granola had great texture and crunch. It really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Was in serious pizza mode last Thursday night after a light lunch with clients, so I probably could have wolfed down two Gladiator Pizzas! The crust was lightly buttered, flaky, crispy and not at all burnt. The cheese was warm, gooey and the sausage was seasoned to perfection. It was a Sicilian symphony in my mouth!   Gladiator ready!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It reminds me of what a local cafe x Whole Foods x gift shop back home would be like if they melded and this was the end product.  My mother and I were looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast and LGO was actually recommended by a fellow Arizonian. Plus, this place has rave reviews about pizza and I am all about that! Unfortunately, they don't do pizza until later in the day so we decided on some French pancakes, fresh juice and I got the cucumber salad.  -Cucumber salad was refreshing, light and so yummy! Really simple but fresh ingredients made for a great, light meal. Comes with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives, avocado, chives, goat cheese and a lemon/black pepper dressing.  -The juices were pulp filled and fresh!  -The french pancakes were lovely, you get about 4 crepes filled with creme fraiche, honey and topped with strawberries that are lightly sweetened.  This place has souvenirs, wine selection, pre-made salads, juices, pastries/desserts, pizzas, gelato, coffee ... literally if I keep going I'm going to make this my priority destination once I'm back in Phoenix.   Such a cute spot to read the paper, eat good food, share a communal table with friends and enjoy the free AC. The workers were nice and cleared plates quickly. It's customers ranged from families, businessmen and women and the like. Definitely going to come back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun little store filled with all the hipster goods your heart desires. My wife and I usually get a pizza and salad. The pizza has a sour dough crust and mozzarella is always on point. We love the margarita and the Gladiator. The gelato is delicious as well. It is a very fun casual environment. Parking is a nightmare though but I believe they offer valet if you go behind by Postinos."}
{"text":"Love chillin on the patio @ LGO after a long week. Mirror Pond Pale Ale, Margarita pizza, tortilla soup and Red Velvet cake!  Boom!  You can select whatever beer, wine or soda you want to drink right out of the market coolers. Then just ask for LGO to open your beer or wine and enjoy it right on the patio.  The pizza is hand made and only fresh ingredients are used.  It takes a little while to get your pizza so have plenty of drink and conversation going.  Tortilla soup was served in a good size bowl and properly topped off with plenty of tortilla strips!   Go ahead and pick your favorite cookie, cup cake or piece of cake from the fresh baked items.  You can't miss on dessert.  Be prepared to be patient with the valet because this place and next door Postino's are always popping off.  This is truly a one of a kind place for PHX.    ~ el Bouj"}
{"text":"Lgo used to be our favorite and in the last year customer service has become SO AWFUL that it's not worth it. There are so many more restaurant options now that you would think they wouldn't start dropping the ball but that is not the case. The employees often act bothered or like I am inconveniencing them. Terrible attitudes! And when they mess up they show no care and again act like I'm the one with an issue! I can't stand it anymore. Peace out LGO."}
{"text":"I always go to this place when I visit Phoenix since I have friends that live nearby and I love it for breakfast.  It's a great meeting spot to visit with friends.  I love their breakfast sandwiches and I have had their salads for lunch which are good as well. The only downside is that it's not that big so there is always a line but the food comes up quickly.  You can walk around and shop while you wait and they have lots of cute trinkets to buy.  The quality is decent for the price. The staff is not the friendliest all the time but I haven't had any bad experiences.  I wouldn't go our of your way for it but if you are nearby it's a cute place to stop and eat.  It's super casual and first come first serve to find a table.  You order at the counter inside the store which by the way is not a grocery store, and then can sit next door in the seating area."}
{"text":"I've only been to La Grande Orange for pizza, but I plan to come back for breakfast or lunch some time soon since its so close to home. The pizza was pretty darn good, we ordered half gladiator and half fallen angel with all of the free add ons! This includes garlic, fresno peppers, onions and an egg!! The trick that one of the staff recommended to us (that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time) was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most. I personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel. We also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table (of course we decided to keep it for am extra $12). It is such a uniquely shaped growler! Super cute, reminds me of a genie bottle! The ambiance was very romantic with dim candle lighting and all of the staff was so friendly and helpful! I am so excited to go here for breakfast or lunch and check out the grocery store!"}
{"text":"The highlight of my visit to PHX terminal 4. Seriously the best baked goodies ever. This place is always packed and for good reason. My 1st time here was a mini personal pizza that will blow away any MOD, Pieology or Blaze. The crust is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and offers a great menu, but after the remodel the prices went up and the portions went down significantly."}
{"text":"Perhaps this is just the cutest place ever? I love the cupcakes here.  Why they're so good, I'll never know but I am addicted.  I had a coconut one that was just amazing. And a chocolately one that I can't think about without getting a tear in my eye. Really.  They're that good.  The sandwiches are great.  The coffee drinks are good.  It's just a really cool lunch spot to hang out with friends or to people watch alone.  I like to bring a book and hang out for a bit or grab the old computer and get a drink and do a little work. Such a great place!"}
{"text":"Such a cute store! I was visiting Phoenix, and my boyfriend found this place for breakfast one morning. Vibrant atmosphere. Cool gifts. Amazing coffee. Delish food. I had a cookie (salted chocolate chip, I believe) that sustained me through a long flight home. Can't wait to go back when we move to Scottsdale in 2 days!   Great intro to the pheonix area. Way to represent!"}
{"text":"Staff was prompt and helpful even making a salad custom for me.   Very reasonable prices especially at the airport terminal.  A great addition."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab breakfast or lunch in the Arcadia neighborhood.  Recommend trying the Cubano sandwich (not listed on the menu) and the bacon potato salad in the single serving deli area."}
{"text":"If I lived in Phoenix (which I'm highly considering after experiencing the 70 degree weather in the middle of winter) I would come to LGO at least a few times a week for lunch and a laptop work session. My time here today has been made up of one beautiful discovery after another!  Walking in, it was really crowded and there were tons of cute little knick-knacks for sale, so I couldn't really figure out how it was a restaurant... that was until I saw the counter and the giant menu of items they offer! After some deliberation I went with the reuben (always my top choice) and a glass of iced tea. I was needing a pick-me-up meal, and this seriously got the job done. The reuben was huge and was piled high with juicy corned beef and a layer of delicious cole slaw, and was on some of the softest marble bread I've ever had. I was amazed! As if the glorious sandwich creation wasn't enough, it came with some sweet pickles and a big slice of pineapple. I couldn't believe how perfect this lunch was! It had me full and back to life in no time. And don't even get me started on the iced tea.  The atmosphere here rocks and is totally conducive to knocking out some work projects. Today it was a mix of biz professionals, groups of friends, and a couple of families. Gabi M. and I started at a round table and then moved to the community work table... the height was better for working on laptops, and there are plenty of outlets!  After Gabi left and Lindsey F. showed up, I was debating going for one of the ridiculously large cookies they have at the front counter. Lindsey told me to do it (she REALLY twisted my arm) and loads of calories later, I was satisfied by a chocolate chip cookie close to the size of my head.   One other awesome detail... they play great music! Get your Shazam app ready, 'cause you're going to want to know the titles/artist names of every song that comes through the speakers.  (P.S. I was just joking about moving to Phoenix. You know my heart is in St. Louis!)"}
{"text":"I liked the hustle and bustle going down in here, coming from other metro areas there just isn't enough of that feel for me in Phoenix.  My espresso drink was good.  I sniffed the cheeses.  I have nothing else informative to add on La Grande Orange.  Bonne journ√©e @LGOGrocery"}
{"text":"Love their Turkey Chopped Salad, Pizza, Wings, and Iced Tea... Very good food but the no servers or full service restaurant before 4pm kind of bugs me"}
{"text":"I would guess Mother Nature opened up this store.  A Camelback East urban neighborhood hang, where you can get healthy eats or simple pleasures with a relaxed very sweet staff. And I don't necessarily need to bring up the sexy people that shop here but c'mon.  I have done coffee in the morning and sandwiches at lunch. The Barista outside does a fine cup of coffee. The lunches I have had, tuna salad, tuna steak and pizza salad. All of these meals are man size and especially pleasing. They even have a wide variety of beverages to wash down those tasty bites. Sturdy neighborhood staples by my standard.   If I might recommend a product that would fit, look into water that comes in a paper carton to sell alongside the plastic bottles. There are indoor tables and as I'm eating, I see some of the merchandise in which LGO stocks. A small but excellent offering as far as I can tell. There are outdoor tables and benches that yield old-school homey aesthetics.   This is a fun place to eat. When I'm in the area, I will be back."}
{"text":"Its one of these places, where everybody tells you how cool it is and how good the food is. But the food is average, quite often cold (as calling the client names is very inefficient) and the food is far away from the supposedly organic/healthy image this place has."}
{"text":"I had a 2:30 flight out of Phoenix and was pressed for time so I didn't have a chance to stop for lunch before heading to the airport. Once I managed to get through security, I headed to my gate to look at my options and they really were limited so I selected La Grande Orange since they had a pretty diverse selection and seemed somewhat reasonably priced.  My biggest complaint with La Grande Orange was the layout. There are several stations, one for pizza another for the bakery and another for sandwiches however there are four registers spaced out. I assumed that you could only order near the station you were ordering from, I was wrong so was everyone else and it caused a bit of confusion. The process is pretty simple once you get to a register, you place your order and will be called when your order is ready. I and ordered a pizza, which at $12 it was was reasonably priced considering many other options. I waited about 15+ minutes for my pizza which wasn't too bad since the terminal was pretty crowded.  Overall it was a decent option, but nothing to go crazy about."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I chose this place for a pre-flight meal. Out of their extensive menu, I chose the margherita pizza and waited the 10 minutes the cashier said the pizza would take.  The pizza was delicious! Super fresh and straight out of the pizza oven visible from the counter. It was super fresh and tasted homemade-an unexpected and pleasant surprise inside of an airport.  The biggest con is the extremely limited seating. Although to be expected, I had to make a mad dash at the first sign of someone starting to clean up and leave, and even then a woman gave me a snarky look and took the table I was waiting for."}
{"text":"I came in a couple of weeks ago and ordered their specialty Honey Latte (iced) with a breakfast burrito. I was actually surprised by the burrito having egg whites - it was quite delicious, but what REALLY got me was the honey latte... omg! I ordered it with their Housemade Nut Milk -- THE BEST coffee ever. I'm not sure how much sugar is actually in it, and that kind of shys me away from getting it too often, but holy moly ... If I could, I would drink that EVERY DAY. Fantastic cute little place. I really need to try the pizzeria soon even though I shouldn't eat dairy ;)"}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs like rubber. Cheapest generic bacon money can buy. They can't even toast bread. It was raw. Did I mention it was expensive!? I fell for this twice. Same exact result. I always wonder how its possible to have a business and produce such crappy food!? Wish I could give them zero stars! Go to Paradise."}
{"text":"Loved my bbq bacon burger and draft Stella beer.  Came on a fresh brioche bun and the bacon was soft and tasty.  Fries were crisp, salty and fresh. Couldn't have been better!!"}
{"text":"I'm lucky cause LGO is in my neighborhood. This little spot has the best ready-made sushi rolls around and the atmosphere is unmatched -- great energy with a mish-mash of different kinds of people. LGO attracts everyone and for good reason -- they've got a great selection of sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, and beverages at reasonable prices coupled with a laid-back vibe that you just can't find just anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know that everyone has wrote a review about this place  It took me a while to get up to try this quaint little gem out, but it was well worth the wait. I went up on Sunday afternoon (12/1/08) for brunch with my friend Jamie. Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside.   First we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks.   For how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!)   While we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees.   I was very impressed with the style and uniqueness of this quaint little gem."}
{"text":"LGO is amazing!! Coffee, breakfast, lunch, dessert, whatever you're looking for! Their food is delicious, whether its for there or to go. The staff is always upbeat and friendly, and the whole experience is five stars. There's a reason this place is always so packed. There are tons of books, gifts, and miscellaneous nick-nacks to browse while you wait, and let me just say...it's worth the wait.  Overall, head to LGO. Try the open face chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"This may be more of a tip than review, but I am here.   The food is pretty good.  They make fresh sandwiches and have a to order menu,  go with the fresh salads and sandwiches, this helps a lot,  Wine are meh.  Airport food but certainly edible. Seating is a premium mostly because of the tight seating at the gates."}
{"text":"While headed to work every morning I come in and order the day breaker, a salad for lunch from the grab and go, a coffee and refill my go green cup.. The girls are wonderful if I am not in a rush I will have my yummy egg whites there..   BEST OJ in town!!   I have been fighting a cold and been getting one every morning.. Grapefruit juice is also wonderful..   Try the havana with almond milk!   All the people here are great. Parking can get a little crazy.   They are opening up the jndigo too soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is not even a sushi place but it pretty much has the best sushi around for around 8 dollars and I always second think about buying a small sized 8 dollar salad and then I eat it and it does not disappoint with how fresh and delicious everything is. BEST DESSERTS, CUTE STORE! LOVE!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The bar in the back is the jam, best bartenders and staff. Gabby, the manager, went WAY above and beyond to make my experience epic. Highly recommend LGO for any mean, and any occasion. AND, I hope one day they add a fish dip to the menu like their sister company, Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Commuter sandwich is delicious. Great coffee. Fun atmosphere with a lot to look at. Wish we lived in Phoenix so we could go more often."}
{"text":"I agree that La Grande Orange is overly corporate. I also agree that the parking sucks. Hell--if you have a complaint about La Grande Orange, I probably agree with it. If I didn't work just a mile away, I probably would never make the trek to this place.   However, I'd still probably give \"LGO\" three stars for two reasons:   1. The sandwiches - all that I've tried are solidly good and not too expensive given similarly priced sandwiches elsewhere in the area 2. The great selection of artisan products and unique gifts - back in December, I found some amazing stuff over lunch to give to some of my friends and family for Christmas  If you are any of the following I'd recommend checking LGO out:  -Coming in from out of town and looking for a breakfast or lunch spot that's more of a destination -A local resident that wants a place to hang out on a lazy weekend morning -Someone who works nearby and has the opportunity to take a leisurely lunch   If not, skip the drive and look for a local place that isn't as overhyped or crowded."}
{"text":"I enter the airport and get done going through security. It's about 30 mins before my plane departs. I run to Gates D because I know La Grange Orange is there. I LOVE the salads so much here, I have one of those punch cards.  I run here, order my faves: 1. Smoked Turkey Salad 2. Cobb Salad 3. Kale and Quinoa Salad   I don't care if each salad is about $10. I'll order two of then because they are done so well! This place has made me picky about quality of my salads.   In the last couple of months I've been cutting it close getting to board my plane because I gotta run to Gates D to get to La Grande Orange, then board my plane in Gates C. Today, I was ready. I had my Brooks running shoes on, and in my work out gear. I ran to get 2 salads then ran to board my plane. I was a happy camper on my flight and ready to jet off to my destination!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of this place at the Phoenix Airport! I usually don't like airport food, but this is one of my exceptions!   Kale & Quiona Shredded Salad - 5/5. Delish and refreshing! This one has no meat, but tastes incredibly healthy! Instead of croutons, there are grapes, which I will have to try to add in to my salads at home. Kale & quinoa are some examples of super foods and I'm so glad they have it here!  Thai Chicken Salad - 3.5/5. I ordered this because one of the employees recommended. It was A-OK, but nothing spectacular. I would not get this again.   The airport site also has gelato! I like the pistachio samples!   This is my favorite restaurant at the Phoenix Airport!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is one of those places that I like so much yet due to so many others liking it forces a strain on my ability to like it.  Allow me to explain. Everything on the menu and in the store is a solid quality product. If it is something to be eaten then it is delicious. If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.  The area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long. The parking lot is ridiculously small and fills up fast and is almost always full with one or two cars already camping out for a spot.  That said, my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on.  I have been living in Dallas, TX most recently and have thought about how nice it would be to have a La Grande Orange out here. With all of the people recently relocating to the Dallas area maybe those who run LGO should consider placing a location out here."}
{"text":"I salute you, Mr. Hard to Find Parking and Impossible to Get Help grocery store. You have enviable prowess in providing cramped spaces both out front, inside, and even around the neighborhood in which you reside. You make a mean pot of coffee, and you have a glorious array of sandwiches. If you were a Gerbil, you'd be the king of all gerbils in the kingdom. For that, I salute you.  LGO has been a family favorite for years ever since they opened. We used to go for lunch every week, and I'd eat the BLT every time, not because I'm not adventureous, but because it is THAT good. Whole wheat toast, a heaping pile of fresh bacon, and avocados. No BLT I've ever had, even ones at home, can touch it. The Commuter Sandwich with smoked salmon always hits the spot at 7 in the morning with my hot cup of Ethiopian Dark Roast. For dinner, you can't beat their pizza with anything other than a Chris Bianco pie. Yes, that's right, I said it, one of the best pizzas in town.   So why, after raving about all of these items, is LGO a four star establishment? Service inconsistencies, pricing, and parking. Numerous times, I've been annoyed by the LGO police, girls who think they have as much authority as a mall cop, because they work there. Get over yourself, you make $7 an hour to slang beans and sandwiches. You ain't no Vice Lord. It's a rare occurance, but it doe happen from time to time. LGO, just like your girls who work there, you need to realize the products you're pimpin aint hoes and crack. $9 for a breakfast burrito with no sides, $3 for a bottle of water, and $12 for a note book is obnoxious. I can go to Kmart and buy the same note book, sans the \"made locally\" stamp, for 99 cents. Parking is A to the trocious. You can't help that, minus .003 stars. Last but not least, please for the love of all that is holy, offer a bigger size for your iced tea. I'll gladly pay for it. Ask Luci, her healthy marketplace has an iced tea fit for a king."}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to go here and expect things to change. I've had the pizza here once and it was great. Breakfast however is entirely different.  They can't cook eggs !!!  Always runny and under cooked. The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food. Really disappointed as I live only a block away.  They might want to send some of there cooks to the Breakfast Club for a refresher course."}
{"text":"the food was really good but the flow of traffic in that place is stupid. I am not a big fan of the LA wannabes either, it's a place to eat so knock it off."}
{"text":"This place gets really packed during the mornings o weekends. The food is pretty good, their bacon is my favorite.   The only bone I have to pick with LGO is how the process of ordering and picking up your drink and coffee can get a little 1. Cramped 2. Confusing.   The line meanders through a retail space so I'm always terrified that if I'm carrying a larger purse that I will knock down a cookbook or a stack of candles. The registers where you order are along the kitchen but the coffee stations are to the left and it gets a little confusing where you're supposed to pick up what. Also the area in which people wait to pick up their food is in the middle of the registers and the coffee area which makes it a tight squeeze.   However I digress, the food and coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"Parking - Lot or residential parking.  I think the lot may be valet only, but they allowed us to park our cars there that day. Ambiance - Very Los Angelesish.  Everything is whole wheat, organic, antioxidant, fresh.  Love the garden feel and outside tables.  Order at the counter, pick up your food and find a table type place.  Price - A bit pricey, but well worth it. Reservations - N/A  There is a line out the door, but it dissipates pretty quickly.    Crowd - Eclectic Location - Google map had us drive through residential areas.  This place is on the corner in a small lot in the middle of residential areas.  Total gem. Food -  1. Guacamole BLT - Looked amazing.  My friend gave it two thumbs up.  Thin layer of guacamole, lettuce, bright red tomato slices, lots of bacon on whole wheat.  Came with a slice of sweet cantaloupe and sweet bread butter pickles.  2. San Danielle Special - Good but a bit salty.  Looks like a club sandwich.  The pesto looking sauce was very good and had added a great burst of basil flavor.  The prosciutto and turkey was very fresh.  The first couple of bites were amazing, but you should eat it when it's still hot.  After it cools down, the sandwich is a bit salty.  Again, came with a slice of sweet cantaloupe and sweet bread butter pickles.  3. Croque Madame - Came recommended by a local and the girl taking my order.  Amazingly good.  Melted gruyere was to die for.  Tomato provided a refreshing burst of flavor and juiciness to the sandwich.  The yolk of the egg provided some creaminess.  Highly recommended.  Saw many people order this. 4. Cranberry muffin - Not overly sweet although it had a sugary crust.  Super moist inside although they could have added more cranberries. 5. OJ and Grapefruit/Pomegranate Juice-  Everything is freshly squeezed and has tons of pulp which I love.  A bit expensive at $3.50 for a very small cup, but fresh and sweet without added sugar.   It is a bit daunting when we first arrived.  There's so much to see and the menu is big.  There's a juice bar, bakery, mini store, wine store, etc.  Therefore, plan to spend some time just milling around.   We all loved this place.  I even bought a mug, some orange blossom honey and their branding of white wine.    The baked goods looked amazing!  The cakes were colorful and the red velvet slices looked moist with thick cream cheese layers.  I wished I had tried one!"}
{"text":"LGO has earned it's stellar reputation. I loved my BLT with guac, and Amy almost passed out when she tasted her open face chicken salad sandwich. This is a fun and lively place to grab lunch - we will be back to try the pizza. Don't bother trying to park - just use the valet."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though! The atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY) The staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants. So here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL! Mia's French Pancakes Croque Madam Commuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great) Jersey Girl Omelete The Cubano Sandwich The Rueben Guacamole BLT I forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!  I also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good! The Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I am from Newport Beach, CA Visiting family. My family took me to the la grand orange for lunch today. I  love the la grand orange concept and the customer service. I was so impressed by the menu, shop and selection of fine wines! The girl who checked us out, mariah, was friendly and very knowledgeable when answering my questions. The food was impeccable, I had a margarita pizza and a chopped turkey salad.  I would love too see this restaurant concept in Newport! I am thoroughly impressed and thank you for making my trip well worth the flight out!"}
{"text":"should have thought it over a little bit more before I tried this place. it was busy so that was a good sign.  as I walked in there was a lady with a half eaten kale salad so I thought that would be a healthy lunch.  I pick up the kale salad that costs $11.  cashier wasn't friendly at all.  it looked tasty but it wasn't.  no taste and I didn't finish most of it.  I thought about the lady I saw with her half eaten kale salad and I think it was half eaten because she didn't like it either.   never again."}
{"text":"We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts, delicious homemade English muffins (can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich w/ avocado and bacon). They sell a great bottle of inexpensive wine- Klee. And always revolving retail area w/ unique gifts. Great place to eat, shop & relax."}
{"text":"The La Grande Orange on Campbell set the curve on grading the airports location. Just doesn't have the same quality and the service is obviously  different. Hey, I would definitely say this is better than the fast food shit you would normally see on concourses. The set up of this restaurant leaves a lot of people confused as well. No one knows where to order and pickup. That could be that I had to put my order in at the pickup counter.   Still a great place to pickup those muffins and latte before your flight."}
{"text":"Love the healthy food options at this place, much better than most of the things you can get at an airport.   Food (breakfast) was good, service was quick, coffee was flavorful, and the menu had a good variety. Definitely a great place for someone to go to if they are spending a lot of time in an airport and don't always have access to tasty healthy food.  I ordered the Daybreaker, which it a turkey egg white omelette, but what makes it tasty was the avocado salsa that came with it.  Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here....this time. Why review them then? I've eaten here before and work up the street. The food is great, if you can get any service!  Today I called to place a carryout order, they asked me to hold. No problem. Then someone else comes on, I ask to place an order the say hold on and I don't get to say a thing. After that someone else picked up and hung up on me.  I REALLY wanted to eat here, but to no avail. When I called back and asked to place an order they asked to place me on hold again. Forget it, this place is too busy for their own good. No sandwich is worth that!  Acacia Cafe is just a few short blocks away, they really care about their customers, the food is GREAT, the parking is much better and the service is EXCELLENT.   Wanna know where lunch is coming from today?"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now. Looked at the menu and everything sounded so good but the line was pretty long, so decided to go get coffee and the red velvet cake. The Havana iced coffee was pretty good and the red velvet was delicious! It's pretty tight in there so it was kind of difficult to move around, but would like to come back and give some of their food a try!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange reminds me of Crepevine or Squat & Gobble (local SF spots). Gotta say that La Grande Orange is extremely better!!! The food is fresh, some ingredients are organic. Most importantly, the food portions are appropriate- not super sized so that you go into a food coma. I love the casual environment. The bonus is their bakery!"}
{"text":"Really impressive Phoenix restaurant, love to come late mornings for brunch! Pizza was fresh and the service keeps up with the line that eventually goes out the door. Great local favorite, would recommend for light eats and meal worth the wait.   Anytime good eats, but get there early to limit wait time - 4.90 Stars"}
{"text":"Love this place.  So cute for ordering a sandwich and picking up a bottle of wine.  Parking is a challenge thought"}
{"text":"What in the world. Eating here makes you forget you are at the airport. If you are a foodie looking for a decent spot for a salad, pizza, burger, or pastry I would highly recommend this place.   They are working on the confusion that other reviewers noted about where to order and where to pick up. The cashier specified where I should wait for my items.   TIP: The Thai chicken salad is amazingly fresh and flavorful, even without the dressing! I was very impressed. The pizza is actually made in a coal oven (you can see it) and was very good with a chewy perfectly doughy (yet crispy) crust."}
{"text":"Don't go here!  Stopped to buy ice cream for our granddaughter and some guy ran into the store to complain that we were in the wrong spot.  A very rude employee showed up and said that we had to leave.  She said she could not take our order to go, even though she said the only people allowed to park in our spot were people taking food to go.  I don't care how popular they are, or how good their food may be, it isn't worth going to a place that tells  you to leave as you are trying to buy their products.  It was a good opportunity to teach our granddaughter how NOT to ever treat your customers"}
{"text":"English Muffin with Blackberry Preserves: Not technically a muffin like those above, but perhaps LGO's most famous muffin (can be shipped worldwide by the dozen) this moist and doughy take on the classic is probably pretty good from your home toaster, but what makes it worth the $2 on site is the treatment - butter lacquered and cooked on the stovetop providing the outside a crisp bite that gives way to the pillow within.  A bag of these and a jar of local honey, preserves, or pretty much any topping sold at LGO Grocery would make for a lovely start to Sunday breakfast at home.  Blackberry Almond Dumpling:  If this is available at LGO you should do yourself a favor and buy two.  Powder sugar dusted and crispy like a croissant on its exterior with a wispy pull-apart interior somewhere between the aforementioned croissant and a cinnamon roll this 'dumpling' was rife with frangipane and fresh blackberries, but more so with butter.  Served warm and well-endowed to make a substantial mess of clothing both black and white I would recommend this one only as a fork and knife pastry, though any mess you make will be worth it.  Pistachio Chocolate Cream Puff:  A cream puff per LGO but a dressed up Paris Brest to me this wheel of choux was perhaps not as texturally sound or traditional as some of the hazelnut versions of France and elsewhere but with crackling pastry topped with a cocoa shell and crunchy pistachios plus an interior of pistachio tinged pastry cream it would be hard to be disappointed by this one.  Every bit as unique as Dominique Ansel's Paris/NY but not quite as decadent I personally loved the sweet meets savory aspects of this one but would definitely go early as the shell was starting to get a bit moist by the time I enjoyed this around noon.  Cr√®me Fraiche Coffee Cake:  I'll totally admit to being a sucker for coffee cake, and even more for butter cake - but prior to entering La Grande Orange that Saturday morning I had no idea there was cr√®me fraiche cake.  With the traditional style obviously focused on sour cream, or in the rare case cream cheese, this take would up the ante in the savories department and with sours nicely balanced by cinnamon and what I swear was cardamom and maybe even rosemary I could have eaten a whole loaf of this if LGO had provided me jam.  With a fine crumb and delicately sweet this went great with coffee but I could see it equally well suited alongside afternoon tea and sandwiches or cheese.  Old Timer Cupcake:  Having already enjoyed the Red Velvet cupcake on a prior visit (as well as the Red Velvet Cake from LGO at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier that day) I decided to try the Old Timer on my most recent visit to LGO and while I'm not sure if you can call it a cupcake since it is covered top to bottom with a crunchy dark chocolate shell and therefore more like a Ding Dong (or King Don for you Midwesterners) it is still quite delicious as the dark chocolate shell, airy chocolate angel food cake, and light cream all come together much like the classic Hostess version, but with a bit less of the artificial sweetness.  Great with a cup of coffee there is really nothing 'special' here, just a really good piece of chocolate cake that goes nicely with a cup of coffee (or a big glass of milk.)  AtoZ Cookie and French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie:  Two more things that go great with milk or coffee, these half pound cookies are without a doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Two choices amongst a daily half-dozen or so each of these decadent creations sets a high standard for texture with the outer rim slightly crisp while the interior falls just short of 'set' but where they truly excel are the ingredients - the former a sort of kitchen sink concoction of corn flakes, caramel, oats, toffee, and who knows what else while the second is simply a perfect dark chocolate chunk cookie heavily garnished with a hefty shake of fresh flaked fleur de sel.  Go early when they're warm - and before they sell out.  Campfire Smores Brownie:  In a word, decadent and in another, intense; for the chocolate lover this is an absolute must (but even then it is probably best shared.)  Dense, moist, and rife with dark chocolate while house made marshmallows and graham crackers attempt to add some levity this certainly isn't an everyday treat but as a capper to a an LGO pizza it worked quite nicely."}
{"text":"I defy you to find a better dining option in any airport - seriously.  While I'm an unabashed fan of LGO I have to say I'm shocked to see how well the quality carries over to this location and as a frequent traveler I only wish other airports maintained such high standards for their dining options.  Had the Red Velvet Cupcake, Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookie, and Giandujia Croissant this time around and as usual everything was high quality while service is every bit up to snuff with the original location.  The best part?  No price hike for the airport location."}
{"text":"I want to thank the LGO management team for stepping up to correct the situation and making sure that things were taken care of in the kitchen at LGO PHX.  I'll stop by again during my next trip to PHX.  It's rare to see management actually read and respond to Yelp review - way to go LGO!"}
{"text":"This place is so neat! The Tuna Steak sandwich is fantastic and the cold brew coffee is a tasty treat to energize you! The store also has lots of nifty little gifts that you can't say no to buying."}
{"text":"Leaving Indy is always bittersweet. I had a great time with my co-workers, but it was time to return to reality. Thankfully, it helped to have a positive experience during my layover in PHX. My flight from IND to PHX was delayed so I thought it was going to miss the connecting flight. Good thing that was delayed too.  This gave me time to grab a quick bite to eat. It was late at night, but La Grande Orange was still open. Hallelujah! Probably wouldn't have eaten dinner otherwise. And the cashiers were so nice, which means a lot to a disgruntled traveler waiting for a delayed flight.  I got the chopped turkey salad, which was a good size and super cheesy. Yum! I took this to eat at a gate adjacent to mine since the shop was obviously closing down. I couldn't finish the whole salad but ate as much as my tired self could stomach. It was satisfying and saved me from hunger going home. If I had a layover in PHX again, I would totally come here, and it looks like many fellow Yelpers feel the same way!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review being I f_cking love this place and they have been on point lately w/ my Nut Mylk lattes! I seriously am always here, the Nut Mylk is so delicious and it's what keeps me coming back a few times a week! YES!"}
{"text":"A foodie friend brought me here for lunch on a Friday. Valet parking was free and though the place was busy, it wasn't ridiculous. I meandered though the odd and eclectic selection of wine, cheese, candies, candles, note-cards and other such things while deciding on what to eat. I wound up with a stacked turkey sandwich (they had me at 9 grain bread, Havarti and avocado) and a mango tea. I found and held the table while my friend waited for the food to come out. Seating was not too hard to find, even though the place was busy. Everything was fresh and tasty. Ambiance was good and the clientele was not obnoxious (nobody sneered at the 2 fat lesbians enjoying a meal or anything  - and in my hometown, the hipsters everyone complains about - they sneer). I took half my sandwich home in a box, but my friend also took some yummy cookies and sweets home too. I'll have to come back just for pastries sometime."}
{"text":"Two stars is being generous for this place. I tried to go here for breakfast with a large group and the system to get food was so chaotic and busy that I actually had to leave. It's not bad enough that I had to spend twenty minutes to find a place to park since space is limited and there is no parking on the street.  I have had their English muffins and they are fabulous but even their greatness doesn't entice me to ever want to return here."}
{"text":"I am such a big fan of LGO that I moved in down the street - literally. Parking was often an issue (because it's so popular) that I decided I would move within walking distance so that I could have amazing LGO coffee every morning.   I recommend the coffee and the salted chocolate chip cookie. They also have amazing pizza, but that is enough for another review."}
{"text":"Really cool place, I wish we had something like this in San Diego! My boyfriend's brother swears by La Grande Orange and called in an order for breakfast before dropping us off at the airport. It's a market and cafe and if you call in an order you can park out front where they bring the food right to the curb for you. Plus they fresh squeeze their own OJ which I'm assuming that's where the name came from.  I had the Venice Beach burrito which was equally both super healthy and delicious with egg whites, tofu, spinach, corn and roasted tomato salsa. The commuter sandwiches on fresh english muffins looked even better but I had to tame myself after the weekend's eating and drinking festivities.  The market/grocery shop is so cute and gourmet looking and I heard the pizza place that they own next door is phenomenal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love a majority of the restaurants in the Phx Airport, this one is no exception. The concept is fast casual, you place your order with the cashier and sit and wait for your order to be called. It's mix between pre made items organized in a fridge, pizza bar, burger, sandwich bar. I love that they had healthy choices, they had a variety of pre made salads, I got the chicken Caesar and fresh squeeze orange juice for a little over $10. That's not bad for airport in my opinion. It was very fresh, my chicken looked like it was shredded off a rotisserie. Tasted very good and it was a large portion, almost 50% of the salad. The decor here is also sleek and modern. I would recommend this place, great options if you have time to kill or on the go."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food around.  Seriously.  I crave it all the time.  However, the front of the house service is ridiculous.  As someone else mentioned in another review, they act like they don't want to be there.  Its pretty awful. Coffee is average.  The gift shop part of the store is awesome.  I can always find good stuff to buy."}
{"text":"We ended up eating at LGO twice at the Phoenix airport during our trip. Both times the sandwiches were very fresh and filled with meat and ingredients. The turkey stack sandwich was very filling with mounds of turkey breast, avocado, tomatoes, on a multigrain bread. The open-faced chicken salad sandwich easily had over a cup of filling in it and served on grilled multigrain bread.  The cost of the sandwiches I thought was very reasonable for the quantity, quality, and being served at an airport.   The grab and go case offers a quick convenience for travelers on their way to their next destination."}
{"text":"Ate at the place at Sky Harbor airport--they are making/cooking/baking here just like a real restaurant--the place is hidden in the smallest part of Gate D.  Great food--had a tuna pannini and had cut fries--bakery treats all lokked great--super coffee--good place"}
{"text":"I wish they had this type of place in the bay! Extremely cute grocery store where you can pick up a bottle of wine to enjoy with Sunday brunch. There were fresh baked goods, fresh squeezed OJ, freshly made salads and desserts galore! I ordered the croque madame and enjoyed it so! It's pretty crowded on the w/e, so come early & have a friend save a table. They're pretty organized so the line moves quickly and cashiers are very friendly :)"}
{"text":"***GREAT PLACE FOR FRESH, LOCAL FOOD***  La Grande Orange Grocery is not your typical grocery store. Consider it to be a casual cafe-cafeteria-ish where you can order fresh baked, homemade goodies and comfort meals from breakfast, lunch and dinner. They use ingredients that are pure and natural - nothing here is made with preservatives or additives! They also have items for those who are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free.   La Grande Orange (LGO) reminds me of Elephant's Delicatessen in Portland, OR. And if you know me, I love Elephant's Deli! So as you can imagine, I fell in love with the atmosphere at LGO. I came to visit one morning for brunch with the parentals and also met up with an old elementary school friend who lives in town. You pretty much order your food at the cash register, pay and wait by the pick-up window for your plate/orders, afterwards, you just find a seat anywhere.   The atmostphere of LGO is hustlin' and bustlin', they are quick to serve and food is made within minutes! As you can imagine, the place is quite loud, so stay tuned for your name being called as they serve your dish at the pick-up window.   FYI: They have a second location at the PHX Sky Harbor Airport (Terminal 4-D). I'm kinda glad that they have a location in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, so I can grab a few goodies to go on the plane and devour!  [devour] *LGO FAMOUS ENGLISH MUFFINS ($1.95/each; $9-half dozen; $16.50-dozen) Ohhh emmm gee! Their English muffins are large! Lightly toasted and sliced in half, the English muffin was served with a side of their homemade preserves and butter. You can tell this stuff is homemade by the texture as you chew into each carbalicious bite. I found out that they sell a bag of them at the airport, so I was able to grab a half dozen to share back home with my foodie friends! *highly recommended* http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#bJEjXkOfQmAZdkt106R1QA  *FAMOUS FRENCH PANCAKES ($6.75; **4 STARS**) The French pancakes were very light and fluffy! It sorta reminded me of a crepe texture. The pancake was made with honey and creme fraiche. It was topped off with several slices of fresh strawberries, which made the meal quite delightful and refreshing!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#3RCEJaMiE1A7SYjfmw-Gsw  *BIRCHERMUESLI ($5.25; **4 STARS**) Consider this breakfast dish something you can also grab on the go! (Also served at the PHX Airport!) Here you have chilled Swiss oats, mixed with raisins, slivered almonds and organic vanilla yogurt, all combine to make a healthy and fulfilling breakfast! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to grab on the go and wants something that is healthy!  [dessert] *RED VELVET CUPCAKE (**3 STARS**) Was kinda dense. The cream cheese frosting was very thick and delightfully complimented the cupcake. I wish the cupcake had a bit more fluffiness in the cake's texture. But nonetheless, it was a decent sugar fix - but nothing to go wild and crazy about.   *SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE (**3 STARS**) This cookie was recommended by the employees. I didn't think the cookie would be uber salty! I like salty-sweet mixtures, but there was too much salt in the cookie for me to eat. The chunks of snow-frost-like sea-salt, had to be dusted off so that the cookie was bearable to consume. I think this cookie would've been awesome if they decreased the sodium content. I did prefer this though over the red velvet cupcake.   [imbibe] *FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE  Why not get orange juice from a place that has \"orange\" within their name and logo! The orange juice was very refreshing and full of pulp! I wish I had ordered a larger cup of this instead of a small! They also sell this item at PHX airport so you can grab a cup of it to go! *highly recommended* http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#OWoA9xTlsGQf9iC_uN5kRw  FYI: parking can be quite limited in the front, there are spots in the back and sometimes they offer valet (no charge).  If I lived in the area, I would probably be a frequent flyer! Seriously!!! If I'm in the area again, I would try out their burgers and pizzas since that's also a popular item on their menu. If you're visiting Phoenix, definitely make a visit to LGO (or at it's airport location!) Happy travels!  Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #33"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Laid back atmosphere, great music and delicious, healthy food. Mmmm...just writing about this place is making me crave the daybreaker :) If you go for breakfast on the weekends, make sure you get there early so you can find parking and a table. It gets crazy crowded!"}
{"text":"my friends and I checked this place out and we had an okay experience. The environment and setting were great, it was a Good Friday night vibe. The service was definitely not great, our waitress did the bare minimum. For pizza my friends and I shared a few that included the vegan Dalai Lama, the avocado pizza, the rocket man, and the gladiator. My favorite was the rocket man, it had a great kick of spice. The vegan Dalai Lama was refreshing but I felt like it lacked flavor and the crushed red pepper that this Resturant offers has zero spice to it. However, I will say that this place has a pizza that is appropriate for all types of diets from vegan to full meat lovers."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is a cozy little indoor marketplace that fulfills all your artisan needs. There's indie gifts and crafts that range from cute to honest: welcome mats that say, \"Our Happy Place\", cards that shout \"Happy Divorce\" and tees with figures hardcore making out on the front - I love it! The aromas are intoxicating, sandwiches and cheeses and wines and Gelato Happy Hour to make any tummy smile, and of course, coffee and pastries on deck, including macaroons the size of your fist (I have a semi small fist but these are not baby macaroons by any measure) and a pizza parlor, too! The only bad part about LGO is that the space can make you feel claustrophobic and it's noisy during busy hours. I came here on a Friday to relax, but there was a steady flow of foot traffic. BUT it's worth a visit to indulge all your senses so try to time your visits during slower times to really enjoy - I definitely will!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Coffee, bakery items, breakfasts, refrigerated goods, and pizza are all outstanding! Parking can be a little hectic, but it's totally worth it. My recommendation: pick a bottle of wine from the grocery section, have it opened at the pizzeria; and enjoy it with an amazing pizza. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Staple of phoenix.  LGO offers so much besides a cup of coffee and breakfast sandwich (both of which are phenomenal).  Its a bit of sensory overload when you walk into LGO... its ALWAYS crowded (people can really sniff out a good thing), and its crammed full of their specialty market and grocery items (tough on my pursestrings because everything they sell is either ridiculously cute or scrumptious). The entire atmosphere is incredibly adorable.   It'd be sacreligious not to get a Havana Latte... Now that I'm thinking about one I just might have to make a quick LGO run today.  The breakfast sandwiches are also to die for and don't forget a red velvet Tammie Coe cupcake (breakfast of champions).    There is the LGO Pizzeria next door/attached and it is also super delicious.    Only negatives are that LGO is very popular and therefore has limited seating.  So if you are wanting to stay awhile to either work or gossip you might have a hard time finding a seat.  Parking can be a nightmare too.  The last few time I've gotten lucky but its somewhat hit or miss and awkward to park."}
{"text":"Tasty treats and sandwiches. Friendly service. WiFi. Good wines at a fair price. What more do you want?!  The place is BUSY though, so here's to hoping they can hold it all together, or open another location for you lucky folks in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've seen. Great vegetarian options, vegan bars, gluten free! Thank you for offering some healthy clean vegan/vegetarian options! Rare in airport!! Chef there is fantastic & the staff was great."}
{"text":"I have a hard time deciding how many stars to give this place. I frequent here because the food is always phenomenal. BUT...... Customer service is not the best. The last couple of times I have been have been very upsetting. This place is pricey, but I keep coming back because of how amazing the food is. I am never greeted with a welcome smile, and my order has been messed up a couple of times. I wish the customer service was as high as the prices."}
{"text":"Some posh Francophile friends hyped up LGO for me that I suppose it would be impossible for them to live up to my expectations.  The food: very good, if not particularly French. The commuter sandwich is excellent, the combination of smoked salmon and avocado is hard to beat. The French pancakes are basically crepes without any fillings topped with chopped strawberries. Also delicious.  The coffee: Excellent. If I come back to LGO it will be for this, and to try the gelato.  The ambience: Unique. Lots of useless kitsch on the shelves along with overpriced \"artisan\" foodstuff for people who correlate better taste with increased spending.  The price: Too much. this is why only four stars. The price won't make you walk out, but for what they offer I was underwhelmed. You're really paying a steep upcharge just to raise your pinky in a posh \"European\" atmosphere.  Good for: wealthy Arcadia housewives Not good for: poor young deal-seekers"}
{"text":"Drove all the way here for what was supposed to be killer food and dessert.  What we got was the following.  ATTITUDE!  Sorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.  The pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?  The desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.  The good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that. The desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.  The bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best.   Will probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free."}
{"text":"Enjoyed pizza, wings, sandwiches and dessert. Everything I had was tasty. A bit pricey, but def worth it. It is always busy and I was a bit confused how ordering/seating worked on a Sunday afternoon. This is a market/restaurant and seating is next door, but you order from the market. They have cute/cool knick knacks that aren't found everywhere. My pizza order was wrong at first, but they fixed it and it was delish! Everything is made fresh, so you may have to wait for your food."}
{"text":"The LGO Commuter sandwich made my day today. I was knee-deep in writing a 50-page paper when I realized I was starving. Thank god they a) offer curbside pickup and b) serve breakfast until 5.  Curbside pickup is a must because the parking lot at LGO is always a cluster...just call in and place your order, then pick it up at one of the three reserved spots in front.  The Commuter sandwich is one of the things I love about living in Phoenix. It starts with one of their incredible english muffin, then they top it with a scrambled egg and your choice of meat or avocado...I go with the avocado.  Based on the recommendation of a friend, I add american cheese and lettuce, and *POW*, what a taste sensation.  You should also try the fresh squeezed grapefruit sunrise (g-fruit juice with a dash of pom) and grab a granola, fruit, and yogurt cup (or GFY for those in the know).  LGO has awesome food, quick service, and a great location."}
{"text":"There are some items that LGO does really well and these are anything from their breakfast menu. Let me start with their commuter sandwich which s to die for...How can you possibly mess up a freshly made English muffin, tomatoes, eggs, and smoked salmon...??? Yum, it was scrumptious just to say the least and well worth the trek from Scottsdale and Pinnacle peak where none of those wonders exist.  As a tip and to avoid the lines, order from the coffee bar that is located outside...Why ? Well first and foremost, you will avoid the lines from inside the store.  What else is good or even delicious ? I love their coffee or espresso. I notice they no longer carry Mr. Espresso from California and have rather gone much more local with ROC (roastery of Cave Creek).   The staff is super nice and very welcoming. The parking situation is a little challenging at times but  I kept my cool and found a spot right across the street without too much fumbling."}
{"text":"This is the trendy place to eat...the food is good but I feel it's overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Figuring out the layout and how to order was the hardest part! We enjoyed our meals! Everything was fresh and delicious!         I LOVED the shredded kale and quinoa salad and spicy shrimp roll we picked up from the refrigerated \"pre-made\" case.      My friend ordered the Daybreaker (omelette made with egg white, turkey, avocados, grape tomatoes)  and French pancakes (crepes)  topped with strawberries, bananas,  and creme fraiche. Everything tasted fresh and amazing.       We also took 6 English muffins To-go as well as several baked items. Among the bakery goods, we chose an apple cookie, some type of decadent double chocolate cookie,  a lemon poppy seed almond muffin, and a salted brownie. Each of them were delightful! I honestly don't remember which were vegan or gluten free because my friend chose the baked goods. Nonetheless,  I was pretty impressed with the flavor and textures!     I've GOT to return with my husband to get his growler filled, enjoy some 4 cent sangria, try a pizza, and grab another six pack 9 those amazing English muffins!  Looking forward to our next visit!   If you love fresh, local,  and tasty, or you need vegan, and gf options....you must try LGO! :-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE LGO. The french pancakes are my favorite thing to get here. I have two complaints. 1... parking. 2... the whole \"we dont have a PA so everyone crowds around to get their order\" system. It seems this place is VERY successful. Perhaps they can't change the parking situation but you would thinking getting a PA system would be a good decision for the owners to make. My boyfriend spent 20 minutes waiting for our food. Usually you like to sit and talk while you are waiting. OTHER than that everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here after realizing Bianco is closed on Sundays. I have eaten here many times before and it is always consistently great.This time we started with the sangria because it's so delicious and refreshing. The only complaint about that if I have to find one is the pitcher they serve it in is big and heavy and it's hard to pour. We ordered the ceviche and it was wonderfully fresh. We ordered the sweet corn and goat cheese pizza and mushroom party and gladiator. They were all Delicious in their own unique way. I know I will never be disappointed at the big orange."}
{"text":"So, I am trying to eat a little healthier because I have been gaining weight lately =bad.  I grabbed the spicy chickpea lettuce wraps a couple mayos and ketchups thinking they may need some help... Boy was I wrong!! Didn't need either the ketchup or the mayo.. Would've been a total mistake. These things should be called spicy Umame Bombs! Holy Shit! It's all  going on in there! Spicy, savory, sweet (sweet pickles... Genius!!!) Fresh, crunchy. My mouth is on fire!  Totally satisfying (good quantity and weight). Oh, I forgot to mention the avocado... Brilliant!  Such a great value,  too at $8,50.  My new healthy diet is rocking!!  Thanks to the Big O!"}
{"text":"[Out-of-Towner Review]  Concourse D...  ...for DAMN, I only have about 20 mins before I need to get on my connecting flight home. Even though the other spot looks good, their to-go section didn't look as great.  So, after perusing La Grande Orange, then coming back to it...I walked away with a Pepperoni Pizza and a water. Of course it's overpriced, but it was pretty tasty. And by tasty I mean so oily it had to be good. For real though, it was tasty, but it literally comes with at least a liter of oil.  They had a bunch of drink options, salads, burgers, and a slew of other options. However, the pizzas are literally there for you to grab, pay, and go. Which is exactly the criteria that is needed when you only have 20 mins before your next flight.  It's decent, I was happy, but damn that box makes it hard to travel with. I'm pretty sure your fellow passengers will be envious of your food, so eat it coyly...as best you can with a pizza box to maneuver.  Grab more napkins than you'd think you'd need for ten pizzas, then grab a few more..."}
{"text":"I agree this is a fairly amazing option for an airport, the veggie sandwich was above average, the ingredients were fresh and it comes with a healthy pineapple slice as a side.  I also agree the ordering/pickup setup is a challenge.  There are two places to pickup your order depending on what you ordered which gets confusing when you order multiple items that need to be picked up from both stations, but overall it was great to have this place as an option during an airport layover."}
{"text":"Big fan. Great place to eat, great shop, great coffee. Admittedly, I've only been for breakfast, but will drive all the way across town to get it. Like both the Zuni burrito and the commuter sandwich. So much better than just your run of the mill breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich. Quality ingredients and great taste. The English muffins are ridiculously good, but also pretty pricey, hence the reason I've never brought a pack home. Staff is nice, I love the vibe, the shop and the neighborhood. Only bummer is, the place is not a secret, super busy on weekend mornings. Pretty decent, speedy service despite that though, so thumbs up!"}
{"text":"LGO goes back to 5 stars for me. As soon as I expressed disappointment in the error in my recent order they reversed the charge and reached out to me to ensure that everything was addressed. They clearly care deeply about the satisfaction of their valued customers and I truly appreciate that. I never planned to stop coming here since I love there food so much, but it adds to the experience to know that I'm valued as a customer and that my voice is heard. 5 stars. Kudos LGO. Here's to more commuters in my future!"}
{"text":"This is such a great neighborhood joint. The breakfast is solid. Lunches are better. And dinner the best. They have this sour-dough pizza crust that rocks. And there's a glutton-free option. Try the roasted corn pizza. It's a treat. The other treat is that inside this place is The Grateful Spoon. The gelati is excellent especially the pistacio. Although, they do have a limited number of flavors."}
{"text":"Great place. Gave it four instead of five stars because parking is always a problem. It is a great place to pick up a little nosh- pizza place next door as well. They have bakery items,. try the red velvet or the chocolate layer cake, sandwiches and more. They are open for breakfast , lunch and dinner. They have the absolute best english muffins-you must toast them twice and they get extra crunchy and talk about nooks and crannies! Oh baby! Love it. Service with a smile- and they mean it!"}
{"text":"Oh LGO what to do with you.  LGO is part of a corner on 40th and Campbell that the owner has managed to transform.  It is a self contained little village.  LGO Grocery being the anchor if the choices on establishments.  Perk - they offer curbside, and has a nice European feel to hit.  They offer specialty goods here and good at changing out the merchandise.  Quick run down  Beverages - nice selection in coolers.  One of the first to carry the orange and lemon San Pellegrino Wines - good selection and the prices are in line with other valley locations Cheeses - they do excel and the cheese selection along with homemade breads Coffee bar - a bit lack luster, I think it could be so much better if the baristas were passionate about it versus college students Pastries - both LGO creations creations and Tammy Coe Menu - is full of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Simple and good, they also offer premade to grab and go  I stopped in yesterday for the pimento dip which I swear has crack in it.  I am not a huge pimento person and I ate this in one sitting.  I have had a variety of items  Homemade hash, All salads, burgers and most pastries.  I do think the LGO's pastries are better than Tammy Coe - I think the others use too much fondit.  The also offer amazing gelato both in the Grocery and the actual gelato store.    IT is a great neighborhood stop, you can chill bring your dog, have a cup of Joe.  Also, on a side note they always seem to be playing wicked music."}
{"text":"I came here on Father's Day for a quick lunch.  Needless to say it was pretty busy.  Service was quick, and I found a place to sit.  I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich.  It was pretty good.  I also had an iced tea.  I am a lightweight, so the tea seemed very strong to me.  I watered it down a bit and added some simple syrup.  I also had an oatmeal cookie to go.  I just realized that I have forgotten to eat it.  I put it in a plastic baggie to eat later.  I hope it is still good!  lol  They have a lot of cute merchandise to look at while you are there.  It's a bit tight to walk around and look, but it's a cute place."}
{"text":"To all the carnivores who have been scarred by vegetarian friends brutally forcing you to \"just try a bite\" of a rubbery Boca burger or flavorless beans-n'-sh*t burger, know that there is hope for you yet.   LGO has perfected the veggie burger. The Shangri-La is filling, big, flavorful, healthy, and cheap. Plus, you can get it wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Take that, carbs. It also comes with a piece of fruit, so your sugar cravings will be somewhat satisfied without ordering a 6-inch cookie to-go and crying while eating the entire thing in your car.   I love that burger so much I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant."}
{"text":"This place is just as amazing as I remembered it when I came here 1 year ago!   Food:  1) quinoa brown rice bowl: sounds like just a bunch of really healthy things thrown together but it tasted so good! It resembled a bibimbop, had a bunch of different ingredients placed separately into the bowl topped with a fried egg. When you mix everything together, there was this really interesting red sauce that was a little spicy. All the flavors blended together perfectly and it was really flavorful and tasty! 2) mushroom pizza: DELICIOUS! I loved the crust/bread part of the pizza. So crispy/crunchy on the surface and so soft on the inside! It's seriously baked to perfection! I've only had crust this good at Urth Cafe in LA! I personally thought it was a little greasy, but the crust was so good, I didn't really care! 3) Red velvet cake: I got this 1 year ago when I came, still SUPER GOOD!!!  4) homemade english muffins: I'm not a huge fan of english muffins but these were SO GOOD! It's SUPER fresh, has a dash of sour taste to it, toasted to perfection but soft on the inside, YUM!  Service:  You order at the cashier and bus yourself. All the people that work there were super friendly and really welcoming!  Ambiance:  It's a blend between a liquor store (good selection of bottled wines for sale) and a bakery, it's a really hipster and young place. There's moderately loud music playing, the place is clean and looks really new, it's super nice!  Price:  For the quality and taste of the food, I'd say this place is very fair for what they charge.   Overall:  I'm in love with this place! I haven't had a single thing that was bad here. I'm going to make a stop here every time I come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to please me.  If you have out of town guests it's a great place to bring them.  My favorite breakfast is their commuter sandwich with smoked salmon and avocado and I've been here for dinner too and dare I say it?  Their pizza is even better than Bianco's!"}
{"text":"Well, the food is good but the service at the airport location is atrocious. I waited at one register but the workers were too busy talking about their weekend plans to help me so I went and stood in line at the other register. When it came time for my turn the cashier walked off then a line formed at the first register where I initially waited. After a couple minutes I waved someone down and asked if I could pay here and he said he didn't realize I was ready. People standing at a register with their to-go salad looking inpatient generally mean they're ready. Anyway, I paid and left and the salad was tasty but the customer service is abysmal. Nothing like the Acadia location."}
{"text":"Really very good for airport food.  The choices were unique and a bit new age.  I had a breakfast burrito with tofu in it.  It was really very good.  The cashier who helped me was fun and seriously perky.  I was scanning the wall menu and then looked around for a cashier in a dazed 'lost airport soul' manner.  He grabbed my attention with eye contact and handed me a menu then led me to the right counter.  Great customer service!  It was also a nice place to sit and wait for my flight."}
{"text":"This place is finally open! It opened today 10/6/12. It can be found in Terminal D. Things on the menu: eggs, oatmeal, other breakfast, burgers, pizza, salads, and a few other random things. The menu is reasonably priced. My breakfast cost $8 without a drink. I've been to the LGO locations within Phoenix.  PROS: - scrambled eggs tasted good, and had herbs - organic fruit was fresh and good - healthy options - fast service - salads can be taken to go - english muffins are sold individually, by the half dozen, and by the dozen  CONS: - bacon was very greasy and could have been much more crispy - include strawberry jam. Blackberry preserves doesn't taste very good. - signature english muffin was a little bit floppy due to the moisture in the plastic container. Maybe put the english muffin in a different holder? Small paper bag? - calling out names loudly is really annoying to listen to after 1 name. Maybe use a number system? Or provide a bigger waiting area?  Bottom line: I would come back, but I would probably order something else like the pancakes or a different egg meal. Or I would eat lunch/dinner here and try something else."}
{"text":"Every time we are in Phoenix we make a trip to LGO. Everything here is wonderful. Love the pizza, love the breakfasts, and love the sandwiches. A fun place to hang out and the food is always exceptional."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Morning Buns are to die for. Pizza is amazing.  We had roasted corn pizza which was delicious. Crust is perfect. There is something for everyone here.  Gets really busy but worth the wait.  Morning buns start fresh at 7am.  Rotisserie chicken sandwich could not be any better. Coleslaw and BBQ Sause adds. No processed meats here. It's cooked on site and served warm on the rolls. So good."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in and I heard the good hip hop tunes playing and saw it was packed with hip looking people, I could tell LGO was doing something right!!  Even though today was a holiday and the place seemed packed, we were still able to get a table during lunch time.   The Reuben was really delicious. The meat quality and quantity were on point.  The Reuben was topped with coleslaw and was the perfect compliment.  The pizza was really really good!!  The ingredients were simple, but the flavors were through the roof.  The crust was my favorite part!!    The chocolate chip and sea salt cookie for dessert was the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  I know the hype has been real for LGO for years, but it's true.    Very solid establishment with a variety of delicious coffee, drinks, sweats and eats!  I can see why whenever I was searching the MLS in this area all sellers would brag about being \"walking distance to LGO\" in their listings, lol, what a gem!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is a cool cafe/ grocery store/ coffee house/ pizzeria/ gelato bar. It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one.   I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.)  Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy.  Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.    There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie.  I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one.  Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat!  The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients.  The parking situation is pretty insane.  They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building.  I chose the later and walked back to the cafe.  i didn't check out their groceries, pizzeria, or gelato bar, so I cannot comment on that. However, per their menu, most pizzas can be made vegan.   I would certainly return to see what other vegan desserts they have, and to get more of those yummilicious vegan apple pie cookies."}
{"text":"I went in here while waiting for my reservation at the pizzeria. I ended up buying 2 bottles of wine and a $40.00 dollar dog  collar! The wine was less expensive! This is a very cute high end grocery and the desserts are so good I almost dropped dead! The peanut butter pie is to die! The parking sucks but you can valet if needed! I have never had bad service and I am not a high end kinda of person. I am from Indiana for Gods sakes! I have had always respectful and polite service!  I like this grocery, its cute and Phoenix needs this place!"}
{"text":"This place is unique, hip, and diverse. There is a maker on one side, restaurant on the other with a tasting room attached. It's a great place for whatever causal level your looking for.   It can get crowded and a little crazy at times but it's expected due to how small the venue. Only complaint is lack of parking. Never any self parking available especially because Postino's is next store. Go during the off times to really enjoy and explore."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is great......at certain times! I used to work by there and the curbside pick-up is fantastic. Other than that? I find myself hesitating to go there now because of the atrocious parking situation. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends and when I can't find a parking spot by the restaurant, I find myself parking in the surrounding neighborhood worrying that my car may be towed when I come out!   Needless to say, their homemade English Muffins are amazing. I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)  This place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off.   If you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up."}
{"text":"i've only been here for lunch, but i LOVE this place. love the food they serve, love the products they carry, love the layout and style of the place, and the speedy staff. i'd give it 5 stars, but there are a few drawbacks. some of their products are EXTREMELY pricey...($60 dog collars?!) and yes, you can be waiting all of lunch time to start to even order your lunch. the lines can be extremely long. the parking is atrocious unless you valet. i've found that the best way to go and enjoy lunch within the hour is to call ahead and place your order over the phone and show up a tad bit before noon. oooh...the added plus....yummy YUMMY tammie coe pastries and a quick stop to paper joy!! :)"}
{"text":"At Phoenix (yes, right now) for a brief 1.5 hour layover between Chicago and Burbank (CA). Famished, I got off the plane in search for some good grub. I'm not a fan of \"local\" airport food because generally the food is overpriced and subpar in taste and quality. Thus, I searched for  McDs (or Burger King...something familiar). Didn't find any around gate D.   At first I was attracted to the smell of the wood oven pizzas. I asked the cashier lady - \"How big is the pizza?\"   \"10 to 11 inches - it comes in 8 slices.\" There was no way that I was going to be able to finish that all by myself. Searched around the long list of menu behind each cashier (4 of them in total), standing behind the long counter. Get this - they were serving Eggs (breakfast style) during lunch.   Anyhow, long long story short, there were several 2 things that impressed me about this joint:  1) Food - I sampled the A-Z cookie and ordered the Tuna Salad. The Tuna Salad was one of the best I've ever tried ...EVER. It had thin thin slices of granny smith apple and the tuna wasn't overly dosed in mayo. It was really good. I paid $7.95.   2) Service - I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say this - the service here is up there...better than Starbucks during its heydays.  While waiting for my food, I was asked (very politely) by 5 different employees, \"Have you been helped?\"   As soon as I finished my meal, a server-girl came up to my side and asked if she can take my plate away.   Let me make it clear - this place looks and feels like low-key, but serves and acts like 5-star hotel.   Anyhow, if you every fly through Phoenix (Gate D area), definitely try La Grande."}
{"text":"Pizza is crisp and tasty, at least the gladiator pizza. Staff is super friendly.  Ordered the chicken wings, really good.  But for me the best food to order at this restaurant is the grilled artichokes with aioli sauce.  This meal is a get your hand dirty and dive in kind of meal.  Just delicious."}
{"text":"I've heard the hype about LGO and this was my first visit (and then again a second time at the SWA terminal at the new airport location). I was not disappointed with the huge portions, unique ingredients and fair prices.   Tuna salad sandwich is spectacular. Also loved the Thai salad. The sonoma garden salad was a little less memorable as I think it's all packaged before you order it at the airport. It still had nice ingredients and they added shredded chicken for me (at no charge)! The other items I ordered at the restaurant location listed.  I imagine all the food is to die for at LGO.  Be aware that in the evenings the sandwiches aren't available and pizza/entrees take about 25 minutes. Salads are still available"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with LGO.  I LOVE their food!  I hate that I never know if they are doing counter service only or if they have servers in the dining area.  I LOVE their pizza!  I hate their parking and now they've turned all their lot spaces into \"19 min only\" parking so you have to valet.  I LOVE their take and go options as well as you can buy wine at retail price in the grocery and drink it in the dining room with no corking fee.  I hate that this is a place that attracts hipsters.  My go to order item is a cheese pizza with extra cheese but don't doubt me until you try it.  They also have great salads and a lot of options for my veggie loving friends.  Things have been a little different since they separated with Tami Coe/MJ Bread but their red velvet cake, English muffins and other bakery items are still spot on.  But sadly there is no replacement for the MJ pretzel stick that stole my heart."}
{"text":"It's okay. Perhaps I should've gone the pizza route because those did look scrumptious. I got a breakfast dish built of rye bread, thick ham, cheese and sunnyside egg on top. It was good but nothing overly special.   For 400+ reviews I was expecting a blow-your-mind experience. It's just a trendy place and for some that is enough. I live to eat so atmosphere has a lower priority on my scorecard."}
{"text":"Not the best experience for me and my wife.  Only reason for 1 star is because 1) we got our food, and 2) a man that seemed to be the manager/owner asked us if we needed help with anything while we waited for our food, showing that he's at least trying to act like he cares.  My wife and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a caesar salad, and 2 small mochas.  The salad was pre-made, fair enough. Later on when I did finally eat it, it didn't taste fresh, and I hope they added lemon or something to the dressing, because it tasted kind of funny. Hopefully my stomach won't be making me pay the price.  Our mochas came out next, and tasted cheap. And...did they use Hershey's chocolate syrup?! $3.50/ea for 12oz cups of cheap mocha, nice.  Grilled cheese with fries took way too long to make. We stood around for a good 20-30 minutes, and was starting to get concerned that we wouldn't have enough time to each before we have to board our flight.  The place is way overpriced. Over $20 for a small thing of lettuce, small grilled cheese with some  fries, and 2 small mochas.  Oh, and the girl that took our order was...having a bit of an attitude. Someone's tired from working hard all day, I assume. Thanks for showing it to your customers!  Overall, would NOT recommend this place at all to anybody.  Pros: -Got our food -Next to our gate  Cons: -Bad food -Bad service -Slow -Overpriced -Possibly expired food"}
{"text":"Holy Smokes! I've been to LGO for every conceivable meal of the day as they're in my neighborhood ... and somehow I've failed in my writing of The Review.  I'm a terrible person.  The first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good.   Sure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register.   I just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)  Whelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The \"Grocery\" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The \"Pizzeria\" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!  FOOD I'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.  Por quoi? Well, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.  Wait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no \"to go\" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity.   DESSERTS I stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)  DESIGN STYLE The first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.)   WINE/BEER  On the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.  PARKING & MISC So yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.  Clearly, I {heart} this place :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. First of all, the parking situation is horrendous. I'm not from Phoenix, so the whole \"valet parking\" kind of threw me off. After that nightmare, we went inside and the whole place is a maze, for a lack of better terms. While in line, people are constantly cutting in front of you to get elsewhere in the store/restaurant. The place is very disorganized. The menu selection does not appear too large; however, there are smaller items which offer a variety of selections. I ordered the open faced chicken salad--what a disappointment. It was two hard pieces of thinly sliced bread with mediocre chicken salad with maybe, grilled apples, and sweet greens--definitely not a typical chicken salad--small portion for $10--I left hungry. The place itself is just a mess and the food is definitely not worth the stress of parking or figuring out how to navigate once inside."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said?  If you don't mind the continual crowds, the food they serve is predictably excellent.  The breakfast fare is exceptional and worth the (sometimes) lengthy wait, however, it would be nice to have a PA system because if you are anywhere but in the main grocery area you cannot hear them call your name.  So consequently your food may sit on the counter for a while getting cold unless you jump up and down from your seat every few minutes to check on it.   The pizza is excellent, as are the salads.  They have a decent wine selection.  The parking is abysmal and even the valets cannot find a place to stash the cars.  Between the 3 LGO places adjacent to one another, there is about 4X more human capacity than vehicle accommodations.  That being said, don't even try to order take-out, you'll get frustrated trying to find a place to park while you run in to get your food."}
{"text":"Whaaaatttt?!? I was confused, I was in an airport and I was eating genuinely fresh and delicious and not greasy food... We were on a rushed layover and grabbed a ready made pizza and a boxed salad with low expectations - and were blown away by the freshness, quality ingredients and most of all the delicious, chewy, slow fermented pizza crust. I would actually opt to come here as a restaurant for that - and having it delivered as a pick-up option during a layover it is an EASY 5 stars.  I hate airport food. I loved this. I'll definitely make a beeline back here next time I'm connecting through Skyharbor"}
{"text":"I had the green chile burger here...HOLY YUMMMM!!!! Amazing! The service, staff, ambience, and food is ON POINT. Oh, and the coffee? That's amazing too!!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Grocery is the \"the bomb!\"  Everything on their menu is great.  Some of the things that you MUST TRY for BREAKFAST:  - English Muffins - Birchermuesli - CROQUE MADAME - ZUNI BURRITO - DAY BREAKER - COMMUTER SANDWICH - THE JERSEY GIRL OMELET  Wow, so good.  And for LUNCH:  - Guacamole B.L.T. - REUBEN  There are two pet peeves that I have with LGO:  1) Parking: Unless you come at non-peak hours (ex. mid-afternoon between lunch and dinner), you WILL have issues finding a parking spot. Thus, you will either have to valet your car OR use the curbside service. The problem with the curbside service is that there is usually a moron that decides not to use the curbside service, and park there anyway. 2) Preserves: When I buy LGO's great english muffins, I expect an adequate amount of preserves. I feel a bit \"shafted\" when you give me six small preserve containers for one dozen muffins. Why? Because I dislike having to split one very small preserve container for every two muffins.  Now that I have the complaints out of the way, I still give LGO five stars for everything they have to offer.  Yummyyy.  Also, I recommend you try their \"Spicy Tuna Roll.\""}
{"text":"LGO Recycles after all!  Received photographic evidence!!!  I cannot wait to buy dozens of delicious baked goods from this heavenly place, get a room at the Phoenician and have make up sex with the commuter sandwich, red velvet cupcakes And maybe even menage tre a couple pizza pies when I'm back in September!!  #sohardrightmeow"}
{"text":"Ok, I have been to LGO several times since my last review. No, I have not been back for breakfast, as there are so many good breakfast places, I would hate to waste a meal on a place that wasn't awesome. However, the pastries and gelato are wonderful. I got their french sea salt brownie a few times...but the one I got this week tied for best brownie in phoenix (with Lux, of course). It was ohhh sooo good. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Also, their chocolate pudding, red velvet cake, cookies, the gelato with the almond and lingonberry, the salted caramel gelato, their ridic nutella croissants, and just about all of their other pastries are amazing. I return again and again for their desserts...and you should too...    PS This place is especially awesome after a delish Ingo's burger... not to put in a shameless plug or anything."}
{"text":"Ok, so on my way to Hawaii a couple weeks ago, the BF and I stopped at LGO to get breakfast before our flight....now, this was a big commitment because it is on the complete opposite side of the airport as where our gate was so it then required us to make a lap around terminal 4 (which is pretty huge). Anyway, I got the commuter sandwich after all of the hubbub about how awesome it was from everyone....it was not good! The eggs appeared to be the same microwaved eggs you get at Einstein's and the sandwich had little to no flavor....The bacon was sad and flaccid. Luckily, I also got a red velvet cupcake again which allowed this  establishment to remain a 4 star place just for the sheer glory of that cupcake, but come on people! There needs to be some quality control or something, because that sandwich was just sad."}
{"text":"The vegetarian sandwich was delicious.  The service was fast and the people pleasant, not jaded as some personnel are at airport restaurants."}
{"text":"Best cookies I've ever had. I'm glad I don't live closer or my next review would be of the Biggest Loser ranch. Awesome gelato too."}
{"text":"Highly recommend their Mother Earth pizza and shredded kale/quinoa salad during your next layover. Good portions, fresh ingredients, nice presentation, portable/carry-on friendly. Was greeted upon entry by employee handing out menus. Can also view menu on board behind registers. Don't forget desert! I had an oatmeal butterscotch cookie that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!  I like this place a lot. Food is delicious fresh!!  Downside - parking lot is small. You can do complimentary valet parking at Postinos next door when you get your ticket validated.   It's a sister restaurant to Chelsea's kitchen - so do you know what that means - delicious kale salad! I love kale salad but I did not order it here.  I went for the pizzas - yumo! I ordered the roasted corn pizza, delicious! I love goat cheese and the combination of the corn and basil on my pizza. When it's fresh baked, the crust is really good. I didn't like the crust as leftovers.   Note:  1. It was very busy on a Friday night! Might I say it's mighty crowded?! 2. It feels dark in there. 3. You can buy goodies and dessert at the grocery store or gelato over there.  Sea salt chocolate cookies? I think I might. :] They also have this at Chelsea's kitchen. Salt brings out the best in everything!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their cookies and baked goods at the recommendation of a friend, this place was pretty good, but not somewhere I would come back to again. They do have free valet, so you don't have to worry about parking your car, but it's extremely crowded and the service wasn't all the best. That being said, they have a bunch of different things on sale here, and I'm not yet sure I know what kind of business this is and what they sell haha. There's a gift store, a bar area, they sell pizzas and sandwiches, as well a bakery and even a smoothie/shake bar area!"}
{"text":"Get the red velvet cake, cupcake, anything with the words red velvet in it. Oh my gosh so good!"}
{"text":"Always very busy, and a 35 min drive for me to get here since I live in gilbert but really, I dont even care. Everything about this place it so worth it. The important part though is, their coffee! Best coffee I have ever had ever. They have a yummy breakfast menu, everything I have every ordered is yummy, including their crepes! Lunch is good, and have to try their pizza!! I always saw a couple of Phoenix sun's players there, which is nice also since I am a suns fan."}
{"text":"I can't figure this place out. It's one of those places that seems like it has to be good from the, uh, uppity nature of the people who've mentioned it. (Uppity: more money than I have) So since I'm obsessed with trying to look cool and like I have more money than I have, (what kind of hipster would I be if I didn't?) I figured I needed to try it out. So what better night than when I am too tired to cook anything, too lazy to go too far, but trying not to eat my stress in Arby's 5 for $5? I read the reviews and the grab and go aspect sounded like just what I wanted.   Here's how it went down, straight first impression style. Parking- uh nope. No parking, went down the street looking, then realized, I just wanted to grab something and go home, no way am I parking and walking in this situation. Went back and snagged a spot in front of the paper store, which was closed, therefore I say it's up for grabs (plus upscale paper stores are bullshit). Go inside La Grande Orange grocery and whoa, that's a lot of stuff, piled to the ceiling, everywhere. In my head \"grocery\" means some aisles and a display here and there, not pyramids of god knows what. I'm afraid to walk around for fear my big ass will knock something over that costs more than my hourly rate. Ok, grab and go spotted, yay! Oh it's kind of empty, ok it's 8 pm, whatevs. Selected spicy chickpea lettuce wraps, and looked around trying to figure out where to pay, there's like 3 different counters. Ok I've figured out where to pay, but what is there to drink? Iced tea or lemonade apparently at this counter. Side note: I did not see an easily accessible path to this drink case they motioned to, so maybe I look next time. Pay, go home, enjoy.   Here's where I am most lost: order food to be made at a counter but coffee is at a separate counter? Like I can't buy food and coffee at the same time? Wth... Maybe I'm overthinking it, but, that's just it, If I wanted to think about food I would have made it myself. Will probably try again for breakfast one day when I'm feeling like a fight to the death.   P.S. Not sure where the hipster vibe is coming from with some people, to me this was all uppity white folk, complete with heads so far up asses that \"excuse me\" is lost on them."}
{"text":"Finally made our way out to check out the hype.  Parking was bananas and the line was out the door!  We were disoriented when we arrived, as it isn't your usual set up.  As a family of five with a stroller and a baby, it was definitely a tight squeeze maneuvering around.  Luckily, the staff was pretty friendly and could tell we had no idea where we were going or what we were doing.  We had the weekend specials: Steak Hash and Chilaquiles which were delicious!  I originally ordered the Quiche, but they came and flagged me down after I paid to tell me that they actually ran out.  The woman I spoke with was very sweet and made some recommendations, and gladly switched my order for something more expensive without having me pay the difference.  The kids devoured their Avocado Pizza and loved their Mango & Lola Espresso Gelatos afterwards.  All in all a good experience and will most likely make the trek out again soon."}
{"text":"Favorite place to shop! Buy pastries and small gifts, sodas and more. The pizza is wonderful as are the breakfasts and the English muffins are the best in the world!!"}
{"text":"Quick review ...   The place Definitely has a hipster/yuppie vibe to it.  Hidden in a neighborhood.  Half kitschy junk for sale and half restaurant.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The food Stopped in with the kiddos so we only got coffee and a cookie, both were great.  The draw is the food for sure.  The bottom line I like the energy and vibe that they have, but it comes at quite a price in that the noise factor is off the charts."}
{"text":"I'm torn.  Three stars for me means that I will go back and I liked it pretty well.  Four stars means I will go back often and have never been unhappy.   I guess LGO is a 3.5 stars place.. Because I go often, but am sometimes unhappy. First, let me address one thing that most people have an issue with. I live close enough to walk there and back, so parking is never a problem and is not factored into my review at all. Let's start with the good things, beause there are many. The coffee is good.  The breakfasts are awesome.  The sandwiches almost never disappoint. The bathroom is always spotless. They have cool stuff like Necco wafers and Black Jack gum for sale.  There are two  things that bring it down a half a star. 1.  The music is  REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, loud!  ALWAYS!!!! 2.Ordering and paying is stressful and chaotic since there are two cash registers, but no ryhme or reason as to which side to go to, and many times I have waited in line only to have someone walk in, bypass the line, and talk to someone over the bakery case, and get served---that can make you feel homicidal and the staff gives off a vibe that doesn't discourage that kind of behavior. Now, let's get to why it is a possible 4 instead of a possible 5.  It lost a whole star for the following reasons.  1.  The specifically have  a parking spot out front for \"curbside while you wait service\" (also for pick up of called in orders I believe)  you can wait in your car until you die before someone comes out.  You have to go inside and get someone.  Just turn the damned parking spot into a handicapped spot and at least then someone can use it!!!   2. the handicapped spots are all the way at the end of the sidewalk to the north, so if someone has a wheelchair or a walker, not only do they have to go a  fair bit, but, and here's the big one, they have to SQUEEZE by the cafe tables and chairs and people, and people with dogs, that are lined up in front. I don't know about you, but I feel like an ignorant pig when I am using one of those front tables and someone needs to get by me, but I had my headphones on, or my head in a book, and they are waiting  helpless. I hate this!!!!!  To top it all off---- Recently, I just experienced it from the handicapped point while taking my mom there for a cup of tea and a cookie.  It stinks!  If they move the handicapped spots to the spot where they have the USELESS \"curbside service\"  I will up this review to 4.5 stars.  If they do that AND lower the music to an enjoyable level, They get 5 stars.  UPDATE:  I now only go either fairly late in the evening or when dragged by someone else. I've decided that my money is better spent somewhere more tranquil.  Still deserves 3 stars I guess."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this 'Airport Restaurant'. I never would expect anything more than 3 stars during a layover. We had a 4 hour flight and when we landed at our layover in Phoenix, we were starving.   We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a go, seeing how crowded it was. There were plenty of other restaurants but I was sure this was the one.   We tried the California Burger, the breakfast burrito called the Zuni Burrito and lastly, the chocolate chip cookie with sea salt.   The California burger was perfect. The fries it came with were nice too. The burrito however was just average. It was a bit flavorless actually. I thought the hot sauce they provided with it would add more flavor, but sadly that was not the case. And the chocolate chip cookie was massive and amazing. I wish I could have one right now!"}
{"text":"The best coffee and pastries in town! Get there in the early AM and enjoy the outdoor setting. Great for cyclist who are out on a ride a want a place to rest and fuel up. Also great for family and friends just hanging out."}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed LGO? I'll keep this short and sweet. Their pizza is my favorite in town. They use a sourdough type crust and it is delicious. Their burgers are also very good. Topped with a mountain of shredded sharp cheddar and you can ask for an english muffin as a bun if you prefer! Their french fries are plentiful and killer and don't forget to end your night with something from their bakery. The gelato and cookies are top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome.  The Zumi burrito was good not great, but the commuter sandwich (avacado and bacon) was superb. The english muffin is as good as everyone says! The manager accommodated our request for mimosas on a non mimosa day. The hostess girl was very helpful for a first timer! Just a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"So I normally like this place but something annoying happened today. On their menu they have a \"vegan coconut and almond bar\" and it has been on the menu for as long as I can remember. When I went to order it I was told that it was not vegan. I asked the cashier and she seemed more interested in helping the people behind me than answering my question. I don't think they know what they're doing and aren't familiar with their own menu. Kind of annoying."}
{"text":"I had driven past this place for ages not knowing what it was but seeing it always packed. Finally decided to go in, it is adorable! I didn't get much but it was delicious. I heard their English muffins were fantastic and I was not mislead. Wish I had purchased a bag to go. SO GOOD with just some jelly. mmm! I also got a side of their potatoes (w/o sour cream) and a side of fruit (w/o creme fraishe). Next time I will try the chickpea lettuce wraps. Their tea is really good, too. They seemed flexible with vegan special orders and I love their wide ranging hours.  I did feel a bit like a fuddy duddy thinking the music was way too loud but other than that the atmosphere, service the food and ingredients were exceptional."}
{"text":"I really like working here or meeting at LGO for coffee. They need more space for standing in line, because the cute trendy boutique takes up a lot of room. Sometimes it's confusing what is available when, like part of their menu is only available at certain times of day. But the food is really good, and the English muffins are killer. Overall, really happy I live near this spot."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong this isn't like going to the LGO in Phoenix (which is amazing) but it's super convenient that it's located in the airport.  I travel a lot so it's nice to be able to get off the plane when traveling back home and grab a salad and drink to go.  Personally I really like the Kale and Quinoa salad but I'm sure other prepared salads are just as tasty."}
{"text":"I love La Grande Orange. They have consistently delicious food, a good coffee bar, and an all around pleasant space to hang out.   That being said, I think their prices can be a bit high for what you get. I ordered the Commuter Sandwich on my most recent visit, and while it was good, it was pretty small (and simple) for $8.50. No side is included. While their food is of good quality, sometimes the price is a bit on the higher side.  Though parking can be difficult, I have never had trouble finding a spot on an adjacent street (just be careful to read the street signs!). LGO recently added curbside service, which is a nice idea, but also makes sitting outside noisier and less pleasant. Most people leave their cars idling while they wait for their orders, which is not particularly pleasant.   Still, I make a point to come to LGO, even when it's out of the way. It's one of the better spots to grab a coffee and hang out. Definitely worth a visit! But if you choose to sit outside, try the outside area closest to Campbell, rather than the tables right out front."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant.  I love the atmosphere and the food!! It's such a great combination and everyone here has amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the turkey wrap. The ingredients were fresh, but seemed like a typical turkey wrap you can buy anywhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheeseburger (sans cheese) that came with fries, and cost $12.  That's about the same price you would pay in the restaurant, so not a bad deal.  The food was pretty good, I really loved the fries!  However, the meat patty on the burger was soooo thin.  I'm not a large person, but that burger still did not fill me up.  On the plus side, some of their tables have plugs built in, which is really convenient to charge your devices while you're eating your meal!"}
{"text":"This place has the cutest and quirkest little items for sale, a great place to shop for a gift for a mom, sister, or friend! I always love the selection of cards they have too.  On top of that, their bakery case is AMAZING. I'm not a huge fan of their cookies (I like mine to be more moist and chewy, theirs tend to be drier and crumblier), but I like their tres leches cake and the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a big Hostess cupcake). Their gelato is really good too and made in-house with no preservatives or anything weird like that. My favorite flavor is the peach, although the mint is also interesting. Just be forewarned that it's REALLY minty, like really really really minty with actual chunks of mint leaves in it. might be good to eat on a date so you can have super fresh breath for that goodnight smooch! haha!  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the parking situation is ridiculous. I know they have a valet who will park your car for you and they validate the valet ticket so you don't have to pay the $3, but it's still an inconvenience! last time I came I had to wait almost 15 min in a long line of cars, boo."}
{"text":"Going back to LaGrande today to buy their famous English Muffins to take to family in Texas. Know that this place is very busy, but the food is certainly worth the wait. I especially like purusing their gift and foodie department!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast at La Grande Orange today. It was our first time and even though parking was difficult I had really high hopes going in. I read up on the reviews from my fellow yelpers out there--and was ready for the challenges that eating here brings. Even though I knew about the long lines and needing to find a table first--I still found it difficult to navigate through this place!   Once we got to the counter and we ordered, I was shocked that our bill was over $25. I had the oatmeal with an English muffin and he had the Daybreaker--egg white omelet--we each had OJ and that was it! I asked for a little side of cream and some butter for my oatmeal and it didn't come with our meal. When my husband politely asked for it--the gal at the counter showed little in the way of customer service skills and pretty much treated him as if she didn't have time to deal with his request--a common denominator from other yelpers as well.   My oatmeal was decent (although I've had better at Taylor's Cafe--costing about $2 less, much bigger portion and it comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries, banana's as well as cream, butter and brown sugar! :-). My husband's omelet was completely tastless--it was an egg white omelet with smoked turkey breast with avocado and tomato salsa. The tomato's were nice but the omelet had no flavor except for the salt from the turkey. If you're expecting cheese in your omelet--be sure to ask to have some added! It contains exactly what the ingredients lsited on the menu reads--no more, no less. The smoked turkey is your average sliced sandwich turkey meat on top of the egg white rolled up with the tomato's and scant avocado pieces tossed on top.   I'm so disappointed--maybe we just ordered the wrong things? When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food, we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well. We finished quick and got outta there.   We'll probably give it one more shot some time down the road. We had the same reaction when we ate lunch at Chelsea's about 6 months ago. Not much in the way of portion for the price you pay. Knowing they're owned by the same company--it sure explains that taste and atmosphere didn't make up for the sticker shock."}
{"text":"How have I not reiviewed LGO yet? How? I'm flabbergasted at the fact that I have not publicly declared my love for this gem of a neighborhood hangout. Here it is - my heart on my sleeve. Or my drool on my shirt  The atmosphere here is the closest vibe I've found to my Minneapolis roots. All kinds of strokes, all kinds of folks, and the underlying assumption that you already \"know\" everyone, including the people you haven't met. Every time I go, which is every other day, I sit next to some perfect stranger and feel like they're my next door neighbor. Funny cuz I actually did meet my next door neighbor at LGO the day after moving in across the street.  Fabulous vegan and veggie fare, enough on the menu to keep me interested for as regularly as I go. And the English Muffins. Oh the English Muffins. They are as big as my face and delicious enough to have their own Facebook page (Hello if the Cowboy Ciao Original Chopped Salad can have it's own FB page, so can these muffins!). Wine shop, colassal cookies, dog friendly and the best source for last-minute random gifts. That is one big ass orange."}
{"text":"Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602."}
{"text":"I've learned to not even attempt to go during peak hours.  If you're really craving them at peak time, eat a snack, go take a walk or do jumping jacks or something.  It was so busy when I've tried it leaves you not wanting to return because it's pretty easy to feel \"in the way\" as you're getting pushed around the tables by folks ordering, getting food and otherwise looking or waiting.  They look stressed, they may miss that your food was pulled out so it's getting cold as you try to get their attention to make sure it's really yours and not one of the 20 people ahead of you. Sure, the food tastes good eventually, but it's not the best experience.  But MAN it's a different experience during off hours!  The service becomes attentive, the food is hot again and let's not even talk about the bonuses where parking is concerned!  The best part is that you can sit at a pretty table with your brunch or linner (Between peak times, remember? Work with me...) and just read a book or share a friendly conversation at normal volumes.  THIS is the LGO I love.    For the prices you pay there - you want that second environment, not the first one.  The prices are totally worth it to hang out and de-stress from the world, but when it's just another stress to go there, it loses a chunk of it's value to me."}
{"text":"What's that you say? You live in Phoenix, Arizona and you're tired of having breakfast at the Cracker Barrel, or Denny's, or even Ihop? What about those 'eggeries' they have around town? Nope? Not in the mood? Oh. You know where you should go? You want a completely different breakfast experience in Phoenix than the usual stuff you can find out in Goodyear, or Peoria, or Mesa?  Go to La Grande Orange. (pronounced Oh-rahnj) Seriously. While more than half the spots in Atlanta would rival La Grande Orange, in Phoenix it's absolutely hands down one of the top three spots for breakfast. Honest.  Okay. So the parking lot is too small for how many people come for breakfast. This isn't LGO's fault, there's actually a lot of parking - there are just too many people coming for breakfast. Okay. So the prices are technically a little more than you're used to paying by about $2. Get over it. The food is better. Well, okay, there's only one item on the breakfast menu that's actually worth the money. The Commuter Sandwich - but it's worth the money.  Using the largest, most flavorful and softest english muffins you can find, they place very fluffy folded eggs in a sandwich along with avocado, and bacon, or turkey or whatever else you'd like. Seriously, the english muffin alone with the egg is enough to make this worth the price of admission.  Sure the lines get long, but I'm sorry, that's what happens when the locals know a good thing - and it's the locals, the people who live in and around the Arcadia district that come here most often. Sit outside or inside, there's enough traffic to people watch while drinking your latte and eating your sandwich.  While you're waiting for your food to arrive, walk around the store and check out all of the french imports that you really can't get anywhere else. I'm not saying they're actually worth the price, but there are a few greatly unique items which you may decide are definitely worth the price. My girlfriend bought a $25 wallet there which she still uses and gets complimented on everytime she pulls it out of her purse. (Okay I know, $25 for a woman's wallet is nothing, but you should see this wallet.)  They also have a selection of wines and cheeses. I've never bought either and I'm not sure they're worth the markup they have on everything at LGO, but it's nice to see, especially after you've wandered one too many times around the Cracker Barrel store.  There's an attached pizzeria which isn't open during breakfast hours, but you can sit in their space when you get your commuter sandwich and coffee. It's quite awesome. La Grande Orange is honestly a hidden jewel in the Phoenix suburban food wasteland. It's not for everyone, but I'd say that if you're in your mid 20's to early 40's even, and you're wanting to seem a bit trendy without trying too hard, go here. You'll definitely appreciate the difference."}
{"text":"stopped by after dinner at the parlor and was pleasantly surprised. the desert selection was a little less european than I was hoping, and tended more toward the overly sweet/cloying end of the spectrum, but for the most part I really liked what I saw. I'll be back for sure, mostly to check out attached gelato bar and pizza parlor. Looks like they converted three storefronts in a mini strip mall layout into a connected grocery store/deli/pizza parlor/gelato bar. high concept stuff, and pretty well pulled off, at least from an aesthetics stand point."}
{"text":"The pimento cheese dip will literally change your life. Don't leave LGO without trying it!"}
{"text":"Great quality as far as airport food goes. They have some menus up, but I had to wander around to find a print menu with their sandwiches. Cubano sandwich was a pretty small portion but was quite tasty. Fruit cocktail was just okay. I'll visit again to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Returned to give LGO another try. Had the cheese pizza, Caesar salad and green chile burger. All were fantastic!  Burger was seasoned perfectly, pizza had the perfect blend of crisp, sauce and cheese, and those English muffins... Totally measured up to the hype! We bought another bag.   Gonna give the desserts another shot.. But honestly, the entries were so great, I'm confident my last visit had to be a fluke."}
{"text":"I thought this was the cutest place ever and was excited that my gf took me here.  It has all the makings of something I like- different menu, little candies to buy, bakery items...  Anyway, I ordered the poached eggs with english muffin, fruit salad and a side of bacon.  The portions were perfect.  The english muffin was so freakin good, I think it's sour dough?  Loved it.  The poached eggs were cooked just right and the bacon was a huge side.  I ate most of it.  My gf ordered the egg white omelet and she really liked it as well.   I got a couple of cup-cakes to go: one was the ooey gooey and the other was the pb&j.  I'd give ooey gooey 4 stars and pb&j 1 star cause it was way too dry. One thing I'd add is it's sorta confusing for a new person.  I didn't know where to find our drinks or food after we'd ordered but everyone was really helpful and clued me in.  Although now that I think about it it wasn't that confusing.   I want to go back and try their pizza..."}
{"text":"Healthy food, lots of electric receptacles for charging your e-devices, and two tables that seat eight easily, as well as multiple two-tops. The tuna melt is super delicious with just a few partially dried grapes to give it a burst of flavor. The whole wheat bread is baked fresh by La Grande Orange. I also enjoyed an oatmeal cookie."}
{"text":"Very nice that you can eat LGO in the airport before (or after!) a flight. The menu is smaller but the basic core items are there. I enjoyed a light, tasty veggie sandwich. I liked the mix of vegetables and I didn't feel heavy or greasy after eating it. The burgers people were ordering looked delish. My friend got a breakfast sandwich which he thought was pretty good but that the bun was a bit stale. Even though LGO is famous for their buns, we were thinking maybe the airport location doesn't always get to enjoy the super fresh quality that the Arcadia location gets to. Either way, it was still good.  Next time I am at the Phoenix airport I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"No trip to Phoenix is complete without at least one visit to LGO.  The Spanish Latte is now the Havana Latte, but I'm protesting and still ordering the Spanish...just to show them that I've been around since the beginning.  I'm an ol' time LGO'er.    The menu has been expanded a little and I'm ok with that.  Service seems to have picked up a little in the speed department, which is good.    I'll probably be back one more time before I head to the airport back to Chicago."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it's super mediocre. From the food to the service. The atmosphere is very overwhelming. I'm a vegetarian so I ordered the Zuni burrito wort no eggs. I could've made a better burrito at home that wouldn't have cost 8.00."}
{"text":"I love LGO! They have great items for breakfast, lunch and dinner and their pizza is delicious!!! Please, open up another location in north Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Oh My Heaven... I can't believe I haven't yelped La Grande Orange .  I am so in love with LGO , I wish I could be an apprentice back in the kitchen and learn how to make EVERYTHING . I have had almost everything on the menu and love it . When I am running to the office ahead of schedule, I treat myself to breakfast , Crepes are beautiful , the Birchermuesli , the day breaker , you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The Banana nut muffin is one of the best I have ever had . The Salads are amazing , I've been eating the Thai chicken salad twice a week , trying to figure out how to make it .  I really want to try the Bloody Marys one of these weekends. I had one at their sister restaurant \"The misfit \" in Santa Monica. I hope it's just as good . LGO should be on your Bucket List . Now Go !"}
{"text":"I am so happy LGO is at Sky Harbor. I travel a lot and I look forward to hitting up terminal D for my LGO fix. The food is the same as the original location, without the lines of course. It's so nice to see some of the best restaurants in phoenix, at sky harbor."}
{"text":"THe LGO grocery is quite unique.  You walk into the front and you see a menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, pizzas, and incredible desserts.  When you turn the corners, you run into a lot of cool trinkets, unique snacks, soaps and lotions, and much more.  The prices are a bit unreasonable, but that is expected of a store that is within a nice restaurant.  I think the rosemary raisin almond crackers looked the most interested that was within price range.  My eyes were glued towards the wine as well.  I will have to update this review once I buy something here."}
{"text":"Man, this place has it going on. I love places like this. It was recommended to us by a person at the resort we stayed at for something on the way to the airport. It has a coffee bar outside and inside, breakfast, lunch, dinner, a tiny grocery store and a bunch of tables in a seperate room with a few outside. Order at the register and wait for your name to be called when the food is ready, serve yourself coffee. The place was super busy when we arrived at 8:30 am with lines sometimes out the door. (maybe 10-12 deep). We ordered, poured our own coffee and got a table outside and waited about 15 minutes for our name to be called. They had so many people working there, and each seemed to know what they were doing. Nobody was complaining. Our breakfast was served on a real plate but with plastic forks and knives. It was reasonably priced (2 eggs, fresh baked bread, meat, fruit $5.50) They have curbside service too. It was funny to see the locals with all their \"winter\" clothing on since the temp was in the low 60's."}
{"text":"OMFG we love this place!   Eating here reminds me of eating at some little cafe on state street in Santa Barbara. It's quiet and quaint and has a very local down to earth vibe. Sure, the parking is a bit tight, but there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood and we didn't mind walking for a few minutes from our car on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.   The breakfast menu is reasonable and the food is worth every penny and then some. We tried the french pancakes (crepes) with fresh fruit and the croque madame and the Venice beach burrito. All were exceptional and left us wanting more. Before we had finished our meal, we were planning our next trip to La Grand Orange.   The grocery store inside is cute and has fun trinkets and specialty sauces and food that a lot of people were buying. Although it was bustling with business, there was plenty of seating outside in the garden area, which was perfect on such a beautiful afternoon.   And one final note....if/when you do visit this place, you MUST MUST MUST try their famous home made english muffins! Ohhhh, they are good! We tried one and ended up buying a whole pack of them before we left. It's like nothing that you have ever bought in the store, and once you try them you will be hooked!  We can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, but on the plane my wife and I both had stomach pains despite ordering different pizzas."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Great food, friendly employees, and I love the environment. My sister and I go here any chance we get! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, this used to be one of my favorite go to spots. I used to live nearby and we would walk over often.  Always appreciated to good food, warm service and fun merchandise to browse through. I know ownership was changed a few years ago and frankly it has been a slow decline since.  I think the biggest issue is the unfriendly service.  The last two times I was there it bordered on rude. There seems to be a high degree of turnover, I rarely get the same person twice.  I was even there twice to witness poor interaction between management and staff where the employee stormed off over pay issue.  Just not the type of experience u expect.  The food quality has stayed relatively consistent but very little change of new items or specials to keep it interesting.  The other big issue is the parking!  Nightmare!  I pulled in the front curbside service and was told I could not order there it was only for pick up of called in orders.  So I was told to pull around behind the restaurant and go in and order my to go order.  When I went there, thee were many open spaces (including the 19 min ones) but the valet insisted he take my vehicle.  For a smoothie and some chicken salad???   Hassle!  Then I had to go in, returned quickly but had to wait in line while your one valet serviced a line of other people.  I could chronicle a few other experiences where the service fell short but ... Bottom line.  Just not enough reward to put yourself through it all.  And no one there seems to really care like they once did."}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza is amazing.  I also REALLY like that you can order a bottle of wine from the grocery with no corkage. Their wine prices aren't bad for bottles that way,  much better than the cost of a glass!  Just don't go on a busy night and you won't have to deal with the parking nightmare or the waiting.  Go on Monday.  It was super good!"}
{"text":"such a gem in phoenix!!  the commuter sandwich... HEAVEN!  their coffee is really good and they offer pizza and gelato so theres something for any meal!  cute shop too!  def recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I visited the little LGO at the Phoenix Airport and loved it! Great service, good food, and delightful hot cocoa. So thankful for this spot of heaven before getting on a plane."}
{"text":"Always the most enjoyable of experiences! The food was fantastic!! I love the French pancakes! The atmosphere is incredibly amazing! Love love love this spot!"}
{"text":"The last few times I have eaten here the food has been awesome and the staff super nice. Looks like management has brought up the politeness & professionalism since my last review here. I would definitely recommend this spot now.   The only down side is that the food takes a bit of time to get after you order at the register (about 15-20min). So if you are rushed for a flight, you might want to grab something pre-made here instead of a sandwich or something they have to prepare."}
{"text":"Put simply: I love LGO. It's stellar! Came in for the first time about a month ago and have since returned at least 4 times. Needless to say, I am addicted now. I've tried all sorts of things here but things I come back for are their breakfast commuter sandwich with bacon (+ avocado, totally worth the extra charge), the croque madam, chicken salad, gelato, and yogurt/granola to go. They make their English muffins in house and they are perfectly delicious. They have to-go breakfast and lunch foods in a cold case for convenience. The bathrooms are clean. Service is always friendly; you can call ahead and they offer curbside pick-up. They have a small parking lot, so that's the only \"drawback,\" but not enough to deduct a star. Next time I go I plan on trying the pizza. You can smell it wafting out the doors as you drive up in the late afternoon. Do yourself a favor when you're in Arcadia and eat at LGO! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Located not too far from the Biltmore.  Directly in front of the store are free limited parking otherwise you can valet or self-park across the street, which is also very limited.  Menu caters to the brunch, deli, and pizza folks! You get crepe, juicy burgers, and healthy sandwiches and wraps.    They do sell all sorts of desserts from velvet cake to cupcakes to muffins to cookies.  All good and delicious!  I've had their green chili burger, so goood! medium well patty with grilled green chili with egg, soo yum! it went down smooth, let's put it that way! side of crunchy fries.  I've had their crepe once, it was pretty good.  The vibe I get from the rest of the menu is fresh and semi-healthy.  If you are hiking Camelback Mountain on a weekend morning, please do stop by!"}
{"text":"LGO..I give you props bc you keep it real and do something different. From the food to the atmosphere, you are truly original here in the valley. This place is great for a number of things from bfast to lunch to wine to cheese to dessert to groceries...the list goes on and on. The open market style of this place makes it so much cooler than so much around here.  Breakfast: Pretty much everything is delicious, healthy, and made extremely well/fresh. If you're in a healthy mood I def recommend the 'Daybreaker.\" Egg white omelet with roasted turkey breast, topped w/ tomato-avocado salsa (bomb salsa!). If you're in the mood for something a bit more tasty, I love their Croque Madame.  Lunch: All the sandwiches are great. Not too big, so a good place if you're looking to keep it light, and again plenty of healthy and fresh options. I liked the BLT w/ guac. Salads are all premade, but most likely daily and I've always had a fresh tasting one. By far my favorite is the Chopped Turkey. All the ingredients blend so well and it's big enough to fill you up.  Dinner: I guess the Pizzeria next door is separate, but I'll just include it here. Pizzas were great, nothing I'd want to make a special trip to LGO for, but def something to keep in mind if you're there during lunch/dinner and if you feel like pizza. Very light and flavorful and love that you get options for cheese *check the bottom of the menu. Def not the best gourmet pizza, but a good one. Crust on the pizza was great, slightly crispy and great dough.  Cheese/Desserts: CHEESE! Great options here. And the best part...you get to sample! If you don't know, the little plastic containers next to almost all cheeses are for your consumption! Grab a toothpick and taste away. Then turn 180 and grab a bottle of wine. Desserts are all made fresh from the bakery next door and offer not only great taste but awesome design. Check in for a review on them soon.  As you can tell, LGO offers so much that you should make it a point to stop in for anything (food, wine, cheese, candy, etc) and just check out the whole place for yourself. A cool and trendy crowd always in attendance, indoor/outdoor/patio seating, and great chill music. Gotta love a little Jack Johnson and an Orange Pellegrino on a nice morning in AZ....and congrats on the LA location, you know you get love from me on that!  ** The reason I gave it 4.5 not 5 stars is bc I think they could do a little better with the bread options for their sandwiches. They do have amazing loafs for sale...so maybe they should start using those as choices bc that would def make all their sandwiches just taste that much better."}
{"text":"So very sad to see their sushi rolls be outsourced now... At least I am assuming that is what has happened since you are now paying the same amount for much smaller, average tasting rolls & no cucumber salad side like prior. If that is the case they definitely should shoot for a lower price point on their newly renovated sushi rolls. I went out of my way for their fresh, larger, great tasting smoked salmon rolls and their amazing cucumber side salad... Such a sad, sad day to see it gone"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The only bad thing about it, is that it got TOO popular! I am very happy for the success of this place. At least they made the place bigger. There was a period of a year where i ate at this place saturday and sunday for breakfast! i was addicted. One thing i like to do if its really busy is to call your order in, so you dont have to wait in line. The only down fall is sometimes your toast gets soggy! Parking is a pain in the butt for this place. This is place is a big hit for people of all ages and its a great place to chat. My fave is croque monsieur. YUM"}
{"text":"I love to hate this place. Quandry--- lol  Update- ****Myan Coffee is super Yummy!  ****English Muffins- Heaven as usual but expensive! 9 bucks but worth every bite.  *Sweet treats are good, not the best I have ever had, but darn good.  *Pizza is pretty good for Non NY style, Artisan pizza.   *Parking is still a pain but the Parking Gods were with me tonight. lol  * Service- Hit or miss for sure. Some people fawn all over you and a few are snobby. The nice ones win out ignore the hipster snobs. lol --One girl who works here is just super rude. I wish I got her name. However, three other servers were outstanding. It is what it is. The Pizza manager is very nice. Maybe Josh????   * This is such a great little concept of a store/restaurant. It is always very crowded though, a little pricey, and not easy to maneuver inside the grocery part thus my opening line. But the food is good. I hear their breakfast rocks it. ( I have never had it yet)"}
{"text":"very good place to eat - all items are well prepared"}
{"text":"Had the pizzeria chop at the airport on my way out of town, then again Saturday at the 40st location.  The pre packaged salad was every bit as fresh and delicious.  Awesome. Had a Gladiator pizza on Saturday also.  Don't forget the egg.  This place continues to provide great flavors and a consistently high delivery each time I go there."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  12/30/06  The love affair is waning.  LGO has become overrun by pretentious annoying people accompanied by small children and little dogs.  Parking is a real problem.  I have gotten one too many plates of cold eggs.   And there seem be training issue going on at the coffee bar.  I have gotten several bad Spanish Lattes.  Very disappointing.  The counter service is also lacking - a lot of the new people working here just don't seem to care.  Ah, how I long for the good old days.  The prices here aren't exactly cheap.   I'm not sure this place is worth the bother anymore.  LGO, you are officially on probation.  UPDATE:  2/9/06  Okay, I love this place.  The Spanish Latte kicks ass.  And recent renovations have improved traffic flow.  It is still really busy, but understandably so.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  I want to like this place more then I do.  It has really great fresh light food.  I love the breakfast and lunch choices.  It has a definite European touch.   I love the atmosphere.  It is just too darn small and busy. There is no where to sit and no where to park.  And if you are not a \"regular\" you don't always feel welcomed.  The concept and food gets 5 stars, but the hassle and spotty service brings it down to 3.  Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for this neighborhood hangout and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"8/17/2013  Bfast club UYE with many many Yelpers today.  Great event.  I was very happy that I got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers I have not seen in a while, Joan G and Meagan G - so nice to see these ladies!     I had the egg-white omelet.  That was fantastically delicious.  A lot of people love their English muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.  So, I am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of LGO.    I love coming here.  Everything about this shop screams hipster and I like hipster stuff too.   I love the lunch salads.  Their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  Just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.    I love the pizza.  IN fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  The star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  I have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  Certainly the last Yelper Cookie recipe in July 2013  was the best cookie I've had from their Bake Shop.  I know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  I always feel like I'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, I've never paid that stuff any attention.  I don't know what is on those displays in that store.  When I was in there today, I noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  But maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).    The parking situation at this corner of Campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  Which is why I normally get what I want from LGO to go.  They have convenient \"to-go\" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  I park, run in , grab what I need and come right back out.      Until this morning, LGO certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. I had to knock them a star for the following TWO  reasons:   #1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  No reservations.  Just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.    RCV Alert:   #2 They got rid of or lost the Tammie Coe Cake's  Red Velvet Cupcakes.   I came to know TCC's RVC when I stopped in to have lunch at LGO once and that's where my love of TCC's RVC originated.  When I stopped in some time ago and saw the RVC cupcapes in the display.  I instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  It didn't look like my beloved TCC RVC cupcake.  I inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  I discovered that TCC's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me LGO's RVC was just as good as TCC's.  Uhm, Houston, we have a problem, that sales person MUST have fallen and bumped her head!  I don't think so.  I've tried the RVC made by LGO's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as TCC's.  The cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  The taste is off..  The cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  The cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  If their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 RVC in PHX.  Certainly a contender in my Top 5 favorite RVC's in Phoenix.  ."}
{"text":"Is the pineapple supposed to be hard and the orange juice taste a little spoiled? Other reviews seem to agree. I should have double checked this place before spending over $10 on breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, specifically the commuter sandwich!  Often a bit of a line due to the trendiness within the Arcadia crowd, but often worth the wait for this tasty dish.  Every other menu item I've had has been good, but not a standout like this one.  A few of my  friends swear by the drip coffee here, but I'm adamant when I call it 'dismal' which isn't a deal-breaker by any stretch!"}
