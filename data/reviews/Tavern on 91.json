{"text":"Went opening night, drinks came out in a timely manner and food was INCREDIBLE I ordered the chicken pot pie and it was the best one I have ever had, table of 4 and everyone enjoyed their food"}
{"text":"Well as I peer at a couple reviews I wish my wife and I shared a mutual experience with the others here. Upon entering for opening night there was a young man opening the door for people and what appeared to be the owner or GM was reprimanding him in front of patrons In a very rude manner. We were seated right away which was awesome especially for the opening night. We were seated just behind the bar.   Upon sitting to to begin our dinning experience we noticed how overly dark it was in there, or maybe this effect occurred because of the super bright LED lights shining directly in your eyes as you looked out across the establishment. Anyways Morgan our server was outstanding and by far was the overall highlight of our experience. The owner or GM by far was unprofessional as he sat down at another guests table to talk with them and proceeded to scream across the dinning area to ask us how our food was and followed with, give us a year and a half and the ribs will be spot on, we are working out the kinks.   We reviewed the menu and it had some decent choices and some unique choices that you wouldn't find at any of the other local restaurants. The smoked meats are something that reeled me in almost immediately because there aren't many places that offer this type of fare. We ordered the crispy artichokes for an appetizer which appeared to be almost like a tempura style batter on them. They were interesting but not over the top impressive.  I ordered the smoked chicken taquitos so I could sample some of the signature style cooking. The chicken was overly dry and to my dismay there wasn't anything on the taquitos that actually gave it some moisture. The tortilla shells were verging on being crispy like they were attempting a hard shell texture but honestly reminded me more of a dry, stale tortilla.  My wife ordered the smoked baby-back ribs because they looked sensational as they were brought to another table.  They were definitely the best plate on the table for sure. They are a dry rub style rub with amazing flavor for sure. They just happened to be overly dry and needed a sauce to accompany them, so we asked our server for bbq sauce which reminded me of that inexpensive generic chili dog style chili with a hint of mustard in it, not awesome by any means. We did order the creme brûlée which had awesome flavor but was a little cold for our liking.   We do understand it was opening night and there is plenty of room to grow but I don't know that anything was nailed even 85%.  We attended their next door competitor on their opening night and I'd say they by far have an outstanding future outlook if tavern on 91 continues in this direction. I'm pretty disappointed in the turn out and hope things turn around in the weeks and months to come. It may be a while before we return to even attempt their food again!"}
{"text":"3 Takeaways: TASTY FOOD, GREAT VALUE, and FAST QUALITY SERVICE  This was one of the best eats for a quality lunch near my office especially due to the fast service. I ordered the Deep South burger, a tasty brioche BBQ burger, and as a side, a spinach salad w/ crunchy croutons. The burger was cooked to perfection.  At first, I waited a minute by the door then was taken by the host/ hostess. I was seated at the bar and was helped by one of the bartenders who provided a few recommendations from starters to lunch  meals to dessert. Additionally, the other bartender with the short blonde hair routinely checked on me and I was happy how quickly from ordering to receiving my bill was.   Overall, this is an interesting new restaurant in Solon. The one area I would complain was a more attentive host/ hostess when walking in. I'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Bought a Restaurant.com special to try this restaurant. Needed to spend $50 with the coupon. Ordered the Artichoke appetizer which was very good. Light batter, fried but not very greasy. DW ordered the PotPie which was basically soup in a pastry shell. Extremely watery, not creamy. Not tasty at all. Pretty horrible actually. Son ordered the wing appetizer which came with 10 wings. He liked them. They were Buffalo smoked and came with side of blue cheese dressing. I did not try. I ordered a small order of ribs. Definitely not baby back. A lot of meat on them. Hard to get apart and the meat came off the bone with a little struggle. Flavor came off very very vinegary to me. Did not like them at all. After meal we ordered desserts. I guess they're changing the dessert menu so they had a pecan pie and chocolate pie. Pecan came out as a fold over pie in a mug over ice cream. Totally tasteless. Tastes like raw pecans in pastry. Chocolate pie was basically chocolate pudding in a pie shell.  Liquidy and not very good. Overall not a great experience and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Food quality poor. 1) came out cold 2) tortillas fell apart on smoked chicken taquittos 3) tiny salad and 3 pcs of chicken for $10 4)appetizer came out wrong. Manager came over to check on us,  said \"not one single person who order taquittos was able to eat the tortillas.  I hope you come back.\"  really? I expected a little incentive to come back,  maybe offered dessert,  a drink,  even 10% off next time. Nothing paid full price for everything very poor customer service. Management needs most improvement. Our server was very good. Hopefully they can fix issues. Taste of food was good."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place in an old venue. Food was good not great. Ribs were the highlight. Service was average to poor possibly due to inexperienced server. Restaurant itself was loud with no ambience to speak of. Appears to be confused. Upscale tavern or corner bar with food. Has to decide what it wants to be.  Probably be awhile before a return visit."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place but it was just awful. I went there with my husband and 3 kids on a Friday night.  I had the ribs and my husband some type of brisket. Both were so fatty and that we couldn't eat them. It's just really poor quality of meat. And the barbecue sauce tastes like catsup. The manager (?) did stop by our table to see how we liked our meal. She noticed that I wasn't really eating my meal. We told her our complaints. She took my meal off of our bill, which was nice of her.  We saw 2 other families that we know at the Tavern on 91 when we were there. No one had anything nice to say unfortunately. We won't go back."}
{"text":"An easy A+ for me. Great new spot with an excellent menu! They're still working out some kinks, but the food was delicious and our server was super friendly and accommodating.  We came in for lunch (4 adults 1 kid) and ordered the rib appetizer. The ribs were amazing. Fall off the bone,  tender meat and great BBQ sauce. Most of the table ordered pulled pork for their appetizer and were not disappointed.  I got the Mahi Mahi sandwich. Cooked perfectly and had a really nice sauce. For dessert we got creme brule and the pineapple carpaccio. I highly recommend both dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an outstanding experience at Tavern on 91! Food and service were both fantastic! It has enough to satisfy every \"in the box\" eater, but also has some great \"outside of the box\" selections.   Our drinks came out promptly and tasted great. We ordered the Rib appetizer as well as the shrimp appetizer and both were outstanding.  For our entrees, my wife got the Cobb Salad and I got the Mahi Mahi sandwich. Both were outstanding! The Mahi sandwich was one of the best I have ever eaten in the Cleveland area and at only 11 bucks I would say it was one of the best-valued Mahi sandwiches I have ever eaten as well. My wife really liked that the menu specified what items were gluten free, which I might add is a pretty expansive GF selection.  The new owners really gave the space a better feel than it had when it was Panini's. And while I'm not exactly sure what they did other than clean it up, take down the tacky beer signs, and place a giant smoker in the middle, the place seems to have a much cozier vibe than it used to when it was Panini's."}
{"text":"Did go back and very disappointed. Ordered brisket sliders again. Went from moist and delicious to dry and tasteless. Mentioned this to the arrogant manager who could have cared less. With some effort they were removed from the check. Wives drink was terrible. Appears the bartenders are being told to pour light. Need quite a bit of fine tuning."}
{"text":"Service was fine. Food was mediocre. My husband ordered the baby back ribs and they definitely weren't falling off the bone. He could hardly get the meat off. I ordered the salmon and the entire plate was just sitting in a pool of butter. We were happy to have ordered salads because we barely ate any of our main dishes. Wasn't that busy for a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a super hopping spot.  There was a long line to wait for food.  We ended up eating at the bar.  Great bartender.  Food was mundane.  If I want a barbeque pork sandwich, then soak the sauce in the pork to give it flavor.  Don't put it on the side. Husband ordered a burger, nothing special.  They need a chef with a \"Wow\" Dish.  Pleasant people and ambiance, just need great food.  Prices ok"}
{"text":"Out of the box home run... Finally a great, menu, atmosphere, and draft beer selection that represents the tastes of Solon and surrounding residents desires and needs.... Bravo, Tavern in 91!"}
{"text":"I was happy to hear this place replaced paninis- something different is always good and there are so many of that chain in the area.  First big win for me was the slaw was vinegar based instead of mayo! Our waiter was very charming and the $5 happy hour apps with no exclusions  made us excited- we ended up getting the calamari but you can even get the normally $12 shrimp.  We selected to get two things from the smokehouse- I got I believe the beef brisket which I thought would be shredded but was still good. My friend got ribs but she said the sweet potatoes were the best part of her meal!   I would like to come back and try some of the lunch items- I think this is a great location to add to the Solon lunch scene for us working in the area !"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday with four people and the consensus was, we won't be back.  Everyone's food was just mediocre. It really feels like the quality is lacking. A newspaper article said there was over 1 million in renovations. Not a chance.  The bathrooms were old and dated, just like it was paninis.  I asked the waitress if the kitchen had been upgraded and she said no. I mentioned the $1 million in renovations and she laughed and said, \"that's an embellishment\" for sure.  Look elsewhere for good quality food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe how surprised I was when I came into this restaurant for lunch today, and after eating at this restaurant, it was not the one I was supposed to meet my friend at. We were supposed to meet at another restaurant across the street with also the name \"Tavern\" in it and I got confused, but since I was already here, I called my friend and told him to meet me at this restaurant, Tavern on 91, instead of the other restaurant.   The place was charming. It had lots of energy. It was sparsely decorated, but very clean. The host greeted me immediately at the door and seated me right away. She asked me how my day was going. I told her, \"So far, so good.\" I then proceeded to ask her,\" What should  I eat?\" She said, \"You have to try the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and our new creamy cole slaw.\" When my friend arrived, we ordered all of the above.   I have to tell you how surprised I was with this restaurant. I was told all the meats are smoked on the premises. I could even smell the smoker when I walked in. The food was absolutely FABULOUS!! The servers were very attentive and the time frame of receiving my food was very reasonable. I must confess it was around 1:30 this afternoon, so they really were not that busy. Although, they did have a nice crowd.   I forgot to mention, Bernie Kosar was also having lunch there with some TV personalities, but I did not know who they were, for I do not watch much television.  Tavern 91, keep up the good work!! I also hear a new menu is coming out next week. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!   My family and I ordered the chili, buffalo wings, chicken sandwich, brisket sandwich, and pastrami. The chili was good, had a nice taste but some fatty pieces. The wings were very good. The buffalo sauce is smokey and has a nice kick to it. The chicken sandwich was good but nothing special. The brisket sandwich was pretty good but the bread became soggy quickly. My dad did not like the pastrami and he said it was cold. The bread with the pastrami was good though. French fries came with all 3 sandwiches. They were very crispy - which we like, but I thought they were kind of bland, so I had to dip them in ketchup and ranch.  There are 3 BBQ sauces on the table, a sweet one, a smoked one, and a mustard based one. My mom and I agreed that the sweet one was too sweet. She tried the mustard one and did not like it. We all liked the smoked one, it was super good on the brisket.   We went around 12:30pm on a snowy Sunday in April. Not too many people eating there. Our food came out pretty quickly but then it was hard to find our waitress for refills.  This place seems to have potential and depending on our mood we would probably return here.  Oh, and someone else's review mentioned Bernie Kosar being there, he sat down at the bar as we were leaving, so if you eat here, there is a chance you might see him too!"}
{"text":"It sucked! Don't come here! Brisket tough and dry! Beans like out if a can! Bread was good."}
{"text":"Had the best time here. If you ruled it out, try it again. The waiter was fabulous with recommendations for burgers and the roasted vegetables as well as always speaking politely each time he came around including \"my pleasure\". We loved him!! Fries are so big and good, crispy seasoned on the outside! Burger was crumbly so you know it was fresh meat and cooked perfectly. Half chicken got a thumbs up from the table, seasoned well and the new sauces were good on it! We will be coming back to try the BBQ!"}
{"text":"Just opened today.  Still working the kinks out.  Very friendly and attentive.    Menu is a bit odd from lunch to dinner.  Only a few smoker items available on the lunch menu. All lunch entree items are either fish or veg.  Lots of sandwiches, snacks, salads to choose from.  I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was ok - their house bbq sauce is interesting.  I'm not sure what they are going for.  It's tomato based, but not heavy or sweet or vinegary.  I'm guessing the background flavor is tamarind.    I'll give them another shot after they run through the routine a few more times."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited Tavern on 91. We were both pleasantly surprised. I visited once before and the food and service left a lot to be desired. I heard they brought in a new chef and the food was great.   Both my wife a I agreed that this is the type of restaurant that Solon has always needed. We walked into the restaurant to be greeted by a huge smoker!  We were then sat in Nicole's section. She recommended the pimento cheese appetizer as well as the pickled shrimp. Both apps were devoured!  The shrimp was accompanied with a smoked tomato sauce that could easily be eaten by itself. The pimento cheese dip was served with house made chips. Its a true southern favorite that I hope becomes a favorite of patrons of the restaurant.   We then shared both the short ribs and brisket as our main course. The short ribs were paired with a sweet potato cake and mushroom and wine reduction. The meat slid off the bone and was extremely tender. The sweet potato cake was an amazing accompaniment. The brisket dinner came with a huge pile of tender brisket perfectly smoked by the chef. Along side the brisket were beans, coleslaw, and fries.   To end the evening, we split the smoked pecan hand pie with ice cream. This new chef really knows how to make the most out of his smoker.   I can't wait to go back. Please give this restaurant another try if you didn't like it when it first opened. The staff does a great job. The food speaks for itself. I can't wait to try other menu items. I will be telling everyone to go to Tavern on 91!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was hoping for a new decent spot in the neighborhood. This place needs to get their act together. The big dining room isn't even open (the only room with non high top tables). They ran out of shrimp.  There's no goat cheese flavor in their mushroom and goat cheese dip (it was basically cream of mushroom sauce.) The apps came out quickly but lukewarm.  Service was friendly but slow (understaffed, only saw one waitress).  And apparently they already had to let their executive chef go so no more shrimp appetizer on the menu."}
{"text":"Brought my wife in for brunch today and they absolutely rocked it. Smoked tomatoes puréed in our Bloody Marys was soooo good! I had Chicken & Waffles and she had the Smoked Salmon Benedict. We cleaned our plates. Totally amazing! Everything is from scratch. Service was great. I know they have gone through some changes since opening. Do yourself a favor, and come back or come for the first time. One of the best meals we've had in a long time. Thanks Tavern on 91!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Walking in the door the aroma from the smoker is amazing! It's a comfortable experience with gourmet exciting dishes! I am addicted to the fried artichokes appetizer! I have had meetings there, girls night, family dinner and after church lunch! It's a great neighborhood spot, perfect for Solon!"}
{"text":"Try the ribs!! And pulled pork! Yum!  They smoke in house and it as soo good.  The mixed drinks are good too!  Not to mention... Bernie Kosar is sitting right next to me..."}
{"text":"Not going to last very long.  Lots of issues.  We had a party of about 10.  Drinks:  They had run out of Bud Light before we got there.  Someone in our party ordered a Miller Lite and when asking for another, he was told they took the Miller Lite off of draft.  Another person, no Three Olives Cherry.  These don't seem to be difficult things to have on hand.  Oh, the guy who wanted Miller Lite got charged for two when he only had one.  Food:  That's another story.  Calamari was mostly breading.  House chips were average at best.  No gorgonzola cheese, so some pimento type cheese dip was substituted.  Wings were pretty good.  Ribs, not bad.  Tender, but I make better ones at home.  Good bbq sauce.  Service:  Average.  Waitress came to the table and complained to us that they called her into the kitchen to explain changes to the menu.  That's not a good thing to admit problems to your customers.  Otherwise, she was pretty good.  Mostly attentive to our table.  Forgot to mention that the happy hour has good pricing.  2 bucks off drinks and half price starters."}
{"text":"My wife and I dinned here one of the first nights it was open. If you're reading this then you know going to a new restaurant within the first couple months yet alone its first week can be kind of rocky. Well this was not the case with tavern on 91. Chef Ian Thompson has his stuff together and is cranking out some great food!! It goes without saying that it's a scratch kitchen, to make it in this foodie town you can't cut corners anymore. I had the chicken pot pie which was absolutely amazing, the puff pastry was perfect, and the chicken to veg to gravy ratio was spot on. My wife had pulled pork. Again Thompson knocked it out of the park. Real deal bbq which is very evident when you walk in the place and you're greeted by the massive smoker sitting in the middle of the restaurant. The service staff was very pleasant and attentive. I would recommend Tavern on 91 to any and everybody."}
{"text":"Went on opening night and again last Friday. The smoked meats are a must. We ordered the brisket sliders for an app and weren't disappointed. I had the Fish fry. The breading was so light and well seasoned so as to highlight the fish. The zucchini joes were delicious. My husband had a slab of ribs. They were nicely seasoned and did not need sauce. They had a good bite! Someone else had pulled pork and loved it and the slaw. It's an energetic restaurant and our server, DJ, was very helpful. Worth the drive from Cleveland Hts.!"}
{"text":"During our lunch break a coworker and I decided decided to give this place a try. When walking through the door, we were greeted by a delicious smoke aroma from the smoker, which is located front and center. It was about 11:15 so there was no problem getting a table. We were welcomed by not only the host but also several of the wait staff standing by the bar. Our waitress was cheerful and made recommendations on what she liked on the menu. She was quickly back with our drinks (just water since we were working, although I'll be back to try the Sazerac and the Manhattan) and promptly took our order. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich and my coworker ordered the Brisket Sliders. The food was out in less 10 minutes from the time we ordered. My sandwich was delicious, the chicken moist and not overly seasoned with rosemary or smoke. My coworker said the sliders were very good. During the meal, not only did our waitress check on us, but also the manager. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awful. Went there even though the reviews were bad. Ordered a Bloody Mary. mix and vodka. No salt and pepper. No horseradish. No nothing except a piece of celery that look like it had been chewed on. The bartender was dumb and clueless. The \"manager\" didn't see anything wrong with it. We love to explore and support local places but we had to walk out. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend's mom and we were not disappointed.  The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and so were the fries. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The place looks like it could be a lot of fun once the kinks are worked out. They have been open for twenty three days, hopefully still learning. I ordered a beer on tap, they were out of it. Ordered another beer on tap, also out of it. Ordered a Coors Light on tap, not working. Ordered a bottled beer, they were out of it. Finally just had them bring me a beer they had. We ordered simple food choices, three burgers and a pulled pork sandwich. The burgers were the frozen patties that were thawed out. I'm sure you've all had that burger before where the texture didn't feel like meat. I didn't have the pork but was told she was disappointed, really didn't have a lot of flavor. Needless to say, it was not a good first experience. Will give it another chance, maybe on the large outdoor patio in the summer and a few more months of getting the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of ribs.  And they've got what I was looking for!  Came here for lunch.  First time here so a bit nervous about what I'm getting into.  Saw a gigantic smoker first thing when I walked in.  That made me excited already.  I ordered a cup of chili and an order of ribs from the appetizer section.  Turned out both were very good.  The chili is very meaty.  Instead of just ground beef, they also use steak cut of meat.  So for meat eaters, this is something you will like.  The ribs are fantastic.  It came with four very good size of ribs and coleslaw in the middle.  Ribs are very charred and even a bit crispy under the sweet smoky sauce.  Not the kind that fall right off the bone that some might like, but still very tender.  One of the best ribs I have had in Cleveland area.  Definitely will come back to sample more on the menu."}
{"text":"Tarervn on 91 was a really good surprise!! A couple of coworkers and I went out for our lunch break and decided to try the new spot.  When you first walk in, the place smells amazing because of the huge smoker in the front entrance.  You immediately start to think of ribs and pulled pork!  We were seated quickly and our waitress was really nice and attentive.  The food did take a bit of time to come out, but that is understandable for a new place.  I probably won't come back on my lunch hour until they are more established just because of limited time.  I ordered the Greek burger which is their veggie burger and it was AMAZING!  It was totally different from other veggie burgers that I have had that are usually made of black bean.  This one was made from veggies and I am not even sure what else but it was soo good.  It was crispy on outside and cooked really well throughout.  It was piled high with spinach, feta cheese and some roasted tomatoes.  I had to ask for some dijon mustard because I personally like some kind sauce on my sandwich.  It was too dry without the sauce, but I recommend getting it if you get this burger.  I got a side salad for my side and it was a really good size and come topped with some veggies and croutons.  The house dressing was also really great.  The only other negative thing here was the decor.  It looked like the inside of a very nice warehouse and had a bike hanging from the ceiling and some random wall art.  Again this is most likely due to the fact that they are brand new.  They also do not have a website yet, which I think they should get up and running in the near future so customers can look up the menus and contact info, ect.  Overall I had a good experience and plan to return later in the future!"}
{"text":"Still here... At the scene of the crime. We started a glass of the house Chardonnay which proved to be disappointing - so sweet it barely resembled a Chardonnay. You best believe it went back. We ordered the wings and goat cheese dip which both were excellent. As for the entrees, we ordered the ribs, the duck and the pork shank. Our waitresses claimed that the duck and pork were both best sellers on the menu and \"melt in your mouth delicious\". The duck was rock hard and I could barely cut a sliver off. The pork shank was dry and hard. Needless to say both went back in exchange for a bland, mediocre at best Cobb salad. Ugh. #bringbackpaninis our every intention was to order dessert but before we could even ask to see the menu, the waitress brought our bill, giving the restaurant little chance to redeem itself!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Well it's not horrible it's not even bad it's just ehhh. Nothing great just okay. Had the pulled pork sandwich and a burger with a fried green tomato on it can't remember the name. They have more options since they have a smoker but I probably wouldn't return if the pulled pork wasn't that great I wouldn't want to spend double that on the ribs etc. Decor is a little scarce as well, so food plus atmosphere is why I gave it a 2."}
{"text":"Not going to last if this keeps up....  Ribs were marginal w bad sides   Salad dressing was more egg than substance  Pulled pork sand which brought me back to college cafeteria. Not a pleasant memory   Service was pleasant but overwhelmed.   Not returning.  Hope they can turn the ship around"}
{"text":"Being a huge smoked food aficionado - I was really excited to try some local smoked BBQ close to home (instead of going to our usual spot next door.)  We were seated promptly and our waitress was eager to take our orders.  I ordered the House Special Old Fashioned to drink.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich... but were disappointed to hear that \"we are out of pulled pork.\"  Instead we ordered a brisket entree, and the smoked ribs entree... and just to make sure we are sampling all the smoked goodness possible - and order of smoked BBQ wings as an appetizer.  While waiting for our drinks - we couldn't help but notice how loud the place was... just with ambient noise.  We could hardly conduct a conversation without feeling like we were shouting, and it was difficult to hear.  And - the place was only half full...!!  The Old Fashioned arrived - and there were full sugar cubes in the bottom of the glass.  They had not been muddled or dissolved.  Not the end of the world - but not a good cocktail.  The wings arrived - and they were fantastic.  Smokey, sticky, cooked to perfection, and a nice presentation.  Sadly - that was the highlight of the meal.  The brisket - instead of being shaved or in strips cut across the grain ... were served in 1\" cubes.  They were tough, dry and rubbery.  Did NOT taste like they were slow cooked at all.  There was no fat or char... no burnt ends.  We both sampled one cube - and left the balance of the plate to sit there.  It's an odd offering - with slaw, hash browns, and a toad-hole??  Why not just slaw, beans and fries?    I had the ribs.  They were not quite dry rubbed... not quite sauce covered.  Something in the middle.  Tender enough - but not particularly enticing.  The veg was overcooked and mushy.  I really wanted to like this place - but if it were not for the wings - the meal would have been a total disaster."}
{"text":"Southern inspired cuisine that satisifies. The ribs were perfectly cooked. The blackened catfish with rice had just the right amount of spice. The hush puppies with jalapeño made me feel I was in the Carolinas. The choice of sides and appetizers made my mouth water. I ate there with two of my teenage children, and both were full and brought food home. That signifies the portions were ample as well as tasty!"}
{"text":"Part of me is soo excited and another part of me is very worried.  Solon and in general this side of town has a restaurant that has a SMOKER!!!!  The smoked food was excellent, the ribs were wonderful.  I just started to go there so I never really like to give a place  a 5 star at a first visit, but this is defiantly on the right path.  Two bars, a smoker, a reasonable amount of TV's for those who like to watch the tube, wifi and excellent food not to mention a very well stocked bar ( did I mention they had 2 bars on the same level).  As I was saying before, I am a bit worried though, part of my resolution for the year was to not eat out at much--- I think I may have been bested - ohh well always next year for resolutions - ha."}
