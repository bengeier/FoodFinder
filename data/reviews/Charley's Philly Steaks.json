{"text":"The employees at this restaurant are not friendly and the portions are a joke for what you actually pay for. The food itself is good but everything else that goes along with it is absolutely not worth it."}
{"text":"In a desert, you drink the water that you are given.  And the food court at the Premium Outlets is a dining desert.  But, Charley's was a pleasant surprise.  While I wasn't blown away and this wasn't the best cheese steak ever (that title belongs to Portofino on Park Rd), it was prepared fresh by a friendly, helpful group of people.  My real rating would be a 3.5.

I got the regular old large cheese steak..  The large is huge.  Served with onions, peppers and a generous amount of cheese (I had them hold the mushrooms) on a fresh-tasting bun that held up well to the toppings.  They cook the beef and veggies on a grill right before your very eyes.  I would have liked to have the veggies cooked longer, but that is a personal preference.  The semi-rare green peppers are *burp.  

The cheese fries with bacon were also quite good.  Lots of cheese, lots of bacon.  But this meal was definitely a case of my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  The large cheese steak and loaded fries are a LOT of food.  It was also $15, which is more than I care to pay, but as a hunger hostage at the outlets, it is what it is.  

Overall, decent quality food court meal."}
{"text":"Such bad service! Everything was given with an attitude! And service was super slow,took 20min to get my philly steak...at least the philly steak was good!"}
{"text":"As good as Jersey Mike's - better if you like hot subs.

Do you want salty, beefy, a bit of cheesy, and hot?  Then Charley's is your place.  One of the few hot sub places around.  If you aren't into Philly Steaks then I can't recommend this place at all.  If you want truly authentic Philly Steaks then I can't recommend this place at all.

This is a nice take on a shaved steak sandwich.  The price is low but you get fresh ingredients.  If you are really hungry then you will need to get two subs, a single large is not enough to satiate me and I am not the biggest eater around.

This is inside the foodcourt and the service can be slow.  I don't hold this against them - they make everything fresh and you can watch them grill.  The meat isn't fresh, they come pre-cut and probably frozen shipped from some meat packing place.  The assembly is completely fresh.

The bread is nicer than that of Subway or Jersey Mike's, think Jimmy John's quality of a nice soft fresh bread.

The food comes out hot - you could burn yourself on the molten cheese and meat.  I like this personally.  If you don't you can wait longer.

Everyone working at this place is nicer than at a McDonald's but not as with it as a sit down restaurant.  I think they have good personality.

Some of the drinks run out and fast: the strawberry lemonade is popular and addictive.  They try to keep it in stock but it comes partially pre-made in a sealed container and those containers run out.

If you liked Quiznos but realized they all disappeared - this place is a good replacement.  If you want a hot sub, or something with beef but not hamburger then I say head to Charley's.

Don't forget to ask for the loyalty program - you buy 10 subs and I think you get one free, it might be 12.

Some people like to have the works - this is where Charley's fails.  There are some toppings but they have a tiny cardboard sign showing all the options and there are maybe 10 additional toppings and that includes mayonnaise and sauces.  This isn't Five Guys but if they did more topping I might be able to improve the score to a 4."}
{"text":"Service extremely slow. We just ordered a quick snack to keepthe shopping energy level high. The ultimate nacho fries with lemonade. The fries were cooked just right, all of the toppings were good portions and very frezh and tasty. Lemonade tasted really instant but not Country time brand. We will go again to try other items."}
{"text":"This review is for the entire food court known as Market Hall. There are 4 generic \"restaurants\" inside (Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and philly cheese steaks). The food is just average but the service is terrible. Orders are cooked/prepared out of order for some strange reason. The staff seems overwhelmed and under trained even at a slower time like 11:40am. We asked for a tray for our food and drinks as well as for the gentleman standing beside us in line with 2 drinks, chicken tenders, 2 orders of fries, and more to come with his small daughter on his hip and we were told \"there are only like 8 trays total for the whole food court\". This place is mismanaged and very sad/disappointed. Eat before you get here or wait until you leave."}
{"text":"Compared to other food options outside of the outlets, 3 stars. But chances are if you are reading this you're choosing between the options in the food court so come here! Like the other review says, sandwiches are hot and the veggies are fresh. The fries are like carnival fries - thick. Sometimes they run out of drink options but that's because they actually serve ok food so everyone comes here."}
{"text":"there is really nothing good about this place. They overcharged on a combo and the customer service is horrible. Lines are up to 30 minutes long and the workers seem to care a bit. If you have time and are willing to wait for a small sandwich then this your place. If you are in a hurry then stay away from this place."}
{"text":"20 minute wait, long line, slow cashier,  dirty counter, filthy grill, ran out of onions, cooks had long braided hair with no hair net."}
{"text":"I ordered from these guys thru foodsby this past week and someone cloned my credit card and swiped it at a Charley's Philly Steaks in NY.  Sounds like a fairly sophisticated system they have going.  Beware of using a card here."}
{"text":"When it comes to mall food courts, you all ready know you're not going to find anything glamorous.  That said, this place does it right.  Charlotte Premium Outlets leaves a lot to be desired in terms of food options as it is.  Your choices are either here or Asian.  Take your pick.  For me personally, Charley's wins every time.

Charley's offers more than just your typical cheesesteak.  Pepperoni on your cheesesteak?  Yep, they do that!  Cheese fries?  With bacon?  How about ranch?  Yep, they do those too!  They also serve breakfast from 10am to 11am.  Everything is cooked on a flattop grill while you watch.  They have fresh vegetable toppings and an awesome house seasoning blend as well.

In true food court fashion, the pricing is a little higher than most comparable food places, but given the circumstances this place is a win for me.  So go 'head, get your Philly on!"}
