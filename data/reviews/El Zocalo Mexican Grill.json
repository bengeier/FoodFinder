{"text":"A wonderful experience dining under the stars with knowledgable and attentive service, expertly crafted dishes and warm heaters and fireplaces on cool nights. The beer selection pleased those who did not go for the refreshing margaritas. The guacamole was freshly made and nicely seasoned   We had the ahi tacos, the shrimp rellenos (big juicy shrimp perfectly warmed), the mole dish with yummy buracho beans, the chicken asado and the vegetarian enchiladas. Every plate was empty and there was talk of licking them. Jimmy knew his products and enticed us appropriately."}
{"text":"Went to Zócalo to celebrate my granddaughter high school graduation. It was outstanding service with excellent personality service. Please check them and ask for the Manager Thomas."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful meal on their patio.  The food was amazing as usual and our server Jaime was great. If you haven't been here yet we definitely recommend it..."}
{"text":"I don't get here very often but I always love their carne asada. Flavorful, tender, and tasting of the flame. The outdoor patio round back is great with water fountains, trees, and that old world feel.  A great place to bring the wife or meet a client for lunch."}
{"text":"\"Good.\" This place is good. Not great, but good. The food is prepared by people who clearly know what they're doing. It's not spectacular, it's not innovative, but it's tasty, and ... good. The margaritas -- the one I had anyway -- were tasty and fresh.

But everything is badly, BADLY overpriced.

This isn't fine Mexican dining in Paradise Valley ... it's friggin' Chandler. If I'm paying $13 for a single margarita it better be prepared right there at my table, or served by a Mariachi band, or something. Like I said, it was good ... but not THAT good. 

Same goes with the food. And order of shrimp enchiladas got me two normal-size enchiladas, rice (bleh) and tasty black beans .... and it was all good. But for $17 it should have been spectacular.

There's a lot of really great Mexican food to be found around Phoenix. This place just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"We came in at about 8:45 on a Friday night and could see a bunch of empty tables as we walked in, so we were kind of shocked when the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait, but that we could wait in the bar.  Well, the bar was super crowded and I didn't feel like wading through the crowd, so we decided to just wait it out on the bench at the front entrance.  To our pleasant surprise, we were shown to our table after waiting only 10 minutes.  Was the 45-minute quoted wait time just a ploy to get us to spend money in the bar?  That was the only part of the experience that put a bad taste in my mouth.

The complimentary chips and salsa were quite good; I just had to add a tiny bit of salt to the chips.  They had a great selection of margaritas ranging in price from about $10 to $25.  For dinner, I had the taco/enchilada combo plate.  It was enough food that I felt satisfied, but not overly stuffed.  The refried beans were on the runny side, but still tasty.  The rice had tiny bits of green pepper in it - not really my thing, but may be of interest to someone else.  My husband had the carne asada burrito; I had a small bite and found the meat to be nicely marinated and perfectly cooked.  The waitress couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful in answering questions about the menu.  We'll definitely be back and maybe next time we'll try the fried ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is generous for this place if you are looking for a way over priced trendy place with mediocre food? Then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"So this review is based off our bar experience ONLY:

So we ordered custom drinks both were poorly made. They were watered down and lacked taste and substance. They barely put any alcohol in them. We also asked for guacamole chips and salsa which were never brought to us even though he came out with a tray full chips salsa etc for the rest of the people at the bar but us. The bar staff needs to be retrained in customer service and attention to detail. They should be at their top of their game on peak nights and they were not. We will not be back........to the bar at least."}
{"text":"Brought my dad to El Zocalo on a Saturday to celebrate his 50th birthday with about 5 other people. The waiter we had was very short and rude with us, and looked extremely annoyed to be serving that night. (I guess he figured with the 20% gratuity already included, he didn't have to fake nice for a tip). The food was very overpriced for how mediocre and bland it was, don't let the gourmet looking photos on their website fool you.  The only thing that makes up for the lame meal experience is the entertainment after 10pm. The restaurant turns into a bar/club type atmosphere, with great music for those who like to dance, and plenty of hilarious off-rhythm drunks for those who like to people watch. They really need to either build another bar, or hire another couple of  bartenders though. I felt really bad for the two guys swarmed with pushy people at the one very crowded bar in the place. All in all, I'd say save your money and eat better at a taco truck on your way there for a fun night of dancing."}
{"text":"We have been here a lot in the last year and this time was the worst experience we've had. We were told 15 minutes to be seated and it took 45. We waited 30 minutes to get the waitress to bring guacamole and take our meal order. It then took another 30 minutes to get fajitas to the table. When I asked to speak to the manager, it took him another 10 minutes to come to the table and he asked how our food was. He had no clue that everyone in that restaurant was also waiting forever for their food. I told him how long we had been waiting and he said that it only took 30 minutes to get our food and he was incredulous and rude when I said that we had been at the table for over 90 minutes. I thanked him for telling me that is now normal so I won't waste my (and the business groups I entertain) time. We won't be back.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Automatic 20% gratuity on parties of 5 and more.  No separate checks.  Tiny tiny portions for the money.  Seriously, $15 for 2 corn tortilla enchiladas.  The rice was hard, the beans were dry.  A message that says, \"one complimentary refill of chips and salsa.\"  Who charges extra for chips and salsa?  At a mexican restaurant...and one that' s much more expensive and less than average quality.  Seriously, I love my fellow yelpers, but this is not authentic mexican food.  It's just bad.  I understand that Phoenix has much to be desired in this area, but yeah.  To be fair this was just one time here....they may just be inconsistent and have good food other nights, but the portions are not likely to change."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for light apps on a late Friday eve.    We approached the door and were told by the bouncers - in unapologetic tone - 'can't come in with flip flops'.   This was odd we were both very nicely dressed and these thuggish bouncers were wearing tshirts.  Stay classy El Zocalo!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my fathers birthday. It was a little creepy because it was the middle of the day on a Saturday during a football game, but the place was deserted. Once you got used to it though, I was very happy to be in such a peaceful place. Our waiter was very soft spoken and difficult to understand, as well as slow to refill water.
My aunt ordered a frozen cocktail, which she didn't seem to like very much.

The food was amazing. We ordered the fried shrimp appetizer and dip. The dip is what made the dish really interesting. It was really sweet at first, but after you swallow it got very spicy (I combo I very much enjoy)  I loved their chips (I ate almost a whole bowl) and ordered the Killer Chimichanga with shredded chicken. I went home craving more. The beans and rice were generic but still a little above my standards for something as simple as beans and rice. My father ordered the enchiladas, which he practically inhaled so they must have been fantastic. The deserts sounded amazing and I wish I had saved room to order one.

I will DEFINITELY be coming here again."}
{"text":"Took family for lunch,nice place but man the price for the food is crazy. Its like the price is double and the portions are small. The food was bland had no flavor. I usally pay 4.99 for kids but there plates were 7.99 and very small. For sure will not eat there again and will tell my freinds not to eat there."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!
Had the salad with shredded beef and was really tasty. No dressing needed here or even salsa for that matter. Service was great as well. Cute little place. Enjoyed myself and the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of El Zocalo. I've eaten here several times and each time the service and food have been constantly good.

At times the restaurant can be a bit chaotic and loud but it's all about the experience isn't it?"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant, but hadn't visited in  several years.  I must say, I was quite disappointed.  The shredded beef was essentially stew meat, and the sauce tasted like it came straight from a can.  They used to be great, but those days seem to be past."}
{"text":"The food was marginal and definitely over priced.  the service was poor.  It took 25+ minutes to get the check.  I complained to the manager, he did nothing, not even an apology.

I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....3.5ish I suppose? I guess I'm a hard critic when it comes to Mexican food, b/c 1. I wouldn't be hurtin if I could never have a bite of mex. food ever again 2. i'm used to authentic Puerto Rican spins on traditional Mexican dishes and 3. I lived in Tucson for a few years, known for some of THE BEST, authentic Mexican hole-in-the-walls (the kind that are often sketch to drive to, but the place is too yummy not to venture for) 

I must say this place is woah cute. In Downtown Chandler, the shopping center it's located in is adorable and feels almost old town neighborhoody. It's patio is a big draw lit with Christmas-esque lights all over. I could certainly see this being a fun spot for a date, b/c its casual enough but still feels intimate.

Couldn't agree more with Dee M.'s entire review below, its more so about the ambiance (feel like you're abroad!). I got the carne asada chimichanga (one of their specialties according to the menu) and it was good, but am I sittin here raving? Nope. It was about $13, and the rice it came with was blahh city. My 3 other friends enjoyed their meals, but can I see ourselves returning again and again? Maybe more like once a year. The margs. aren't rave worthy either. Ellen and I got the classic OG (pretty handblown glass I must say), which tasted good, but it was a lil weak. I would suggest one of the others that are topped with Cointreau or Chambord (wouldn't really suggest the Midori one, it's crazy sweet, even for a Midori lover).

Also, it took *quite a bit* for our meals to arrive, despite the extremely attentive waiter in terms of drinks, chips and salsa, whatnot. 

I suppose I would suggest this if you live in the area, the interior is very inviting and pretty. On a nice night, the patio wait is longer than inside. Want to soon check out the other restaurants in this center, along with the pub next door!"}
{"text":"Great food and Chris, our server, was very attentive. It's a little loud inside, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this is darn good food. My only put-off was the price of my wife's skinny margarita which was the price of an entree."}
{"text":"The patio seating is the best there with misters and umbrellas to stay cool even in the summer.   The Carne Asada  burrito is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very festive feel and great food. I normally get the chimis with their poblano sauce; so good. This was recommended to us our first time there, and we never seem to order anything else! The margaritas are a hit and the ambiance at night in the outdoor patio feels authentic; great place if you love Mexican food. We go back frequently and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Current review was 3 stars, very good place to get a margarita. Service was okay, the outside seating is beautiful. I personally wouldn't go there for good Mexican food, but going for drinks is a definite must if you like to dance on Friday or Saturday nights."}
{"text":"wife and I went to the bar on Saturday afternoon. I ordered a Moscow Mule my wife ordered a margarita on the rocks. love you both. What we both received to two drink filled with ice and very little drink. An outrageous charge of $19.00 (prices not listed on the drink menu, first guess that charge what they want) and an unfriendly bartender.  Yes, I grudgingly left a 2.50.tip. TOTAL RIPOFF."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food. Bad experience. Indifferent management. There are far too many good Mexican restaurants around to ever consider returning to this place. The waiter seemed to be dazed and confused. The manager could care less that we had an awful experience. Bottom line: we once liked it. Now, we wouldn't ever consider returning nor would we recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went there for my bachelorette party last weekend and it was the most fun I've had in such a long time! The DJ was amazing and the appetizers/ drinks were perfect!!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Lived in Chandler for 13 years so I've dined here several times. Not sure why we could not get served today. 1:15pm Saturday. We have money to pay for our food! We were seated and the hostess with no personality (as described in recent reviews) brought us chips and salsa but no water. The server never came to our table but walked by twice while going to the other, only occupied table in the restaurant. We prefer to patronize local businesses but you've lost our business. Please fix the problem. We're heading to IHOP."}
{"text":"I love this resturant . I don't know why ppl are complaing . The food was delicious we order the carne asada burrito with green and red sauce and on the side it had rice and beans everything was delicious . The patio looks really nice and relaxing with all the trees providing shade and huge fans making it fresh . The only thing was the price we order two burritos + 2 dos x beers + a margarita + a flan and tip the total was 65 but if you want the best you have to pay the price ."}
{"text":"No silverware or napkins on a take out order. Charge for chips and salsa. Soggy carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday, because the other places we wanted to go were closed. I had been there once before and thought it was good. It is quite expensive. The margarita was just OK, tasted more like a very good smoothie, barely any alcohol. At $8 , I had expected more. 
The food was mediocre. For that price I was quite disappointed. The service was acceptable."}
{"text":"We were on a weekend quest for the perfect afternoon outdoor patio and found it at el Zocalo. A fabulous, lush patio, reminiscent of an old Mexican villa. The food and margaritas were excelent. And to answer the question.... Would you get it again? You bet!"}
{"text":"Have you thought of downtown Chandler lately? It's got a lot of personality and great Mexican food. Their patio is great. Be prepared to wait on a weekend night.

I like the tacos and the house margarita. Music can be a bit loud."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday.  Really great atmosphere and beautiful patio.    The margaritas are good and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered three dinners here tonight. Two were delicious, and one was inedible. 

Each of the three of us tasted this meal, and the fish was BAD. It was the pescado tacos (I had ahi tuna tacos, which were great). The pescado taco dish is $17, and consists of two tacos, rice, and beans. Obviously, the beans and rice were eaten. It was.busy, and the tacos were GROSS.  Half of one of the tacos was gone, if that, because all three of us tasted it.The manager refused to credit us for the meal, giving us a $7 credit, and stating that \"most of the food was eaten, but we'll make it right.\" 

Really? So, we paid $10 for a puny side of rice and beans? Refusing to credit us for the whole meal, and then begrudgingly and half heartedly offering to \"make it right\" is very low class, El Zocalo. 

I pointed out that we were there on St. Patrick's Day, sober and polite, waited patiently for our food, and recieved bad fish. I told the manager he can keep the $10, as at that point I was planning to leave a bad review on Yelp anyway. 

For the record, we tipped our waiter well, as it was no fault of his, and he clearly felt badly about the whole situation. Additionally, I personally will eat just about anything without complaint, and even I could not stomach that fish.

If they were to get a new manager, I would have had no complaint. The food was just average. Occasionally, some of the food is going to go bad; it happens. In the face of our politeness, the smarmy attitude of the manager was totally unacceptable. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner at El Zocalo - very lovely patio, not very good food.  My husbands chicken was burnt, my carne asada was tough.  Although the margaritas were tasty, they were $10 a piece, which none of the prices for margaritas were printed on the menu.  Spending over $60, we expected higher quality food."}
{"text":"When the weather is nice I can't think of a better place to eat.   Love the patio.  Service and food have been really good every time.  The bar is typical mex. nothing special as far as tap beer.  I'm not into margs.  Been back many, many times."}
{"text":"I really, Really, REALLY want to love this place, but I can't get over how much the staff sucks! With the exception of the bartender (dude with cool mustache), every time I come here I am NEVER greeted, takes FOREVER to get someone to come around to take our orders. My husband and I live a mile down the road so we always dine at one of the restaurants nearby because we like to support our community, but I can't stand how rude everyone is. I feel like we're an inconvenience when we walk in. Fri/Sat nights are cool for dancing and hanging out and the place is beautiful, but the rude staff kills it for me. Every now and then, we come back to give it another go, but it never fails; I end up getting subpar service so we leave and walk over to San Tan Brewery instead."}
{"text":"We've frequented El Zocalo for years now. 

The food is authentic, the patio is amazing to dine at night with the rustic walkways, band, small atmosphere light bulbs and the sense of a little retreat/getaway. Great for date night or a quick lunch. A Chandler staple.

{"text":"Took clients here for a nice dinner with margaritas and good mexican food.  Almost everyone ordered the Shrimp Relleno...which appeared to be a pretty good dish.  I ordered the Enchiladas De Rez...beef enchiladas.  One looked like pork...I thought \"Huh, okay maybe they subbed a pork for a beef\" so I ate it not wanting to cause a fuss...anyway, puked when I got back to the hotel and three days later in the ER, the Doc says, \"Son, you exhibit all the sysmptoms of Botulism poisoning\".  Pretty nasty stuff...finally over it but I can assure you, never ever ever ever will I come close to that place ever again.  Good luck to anyone that eats there...cheers!"}
{"text":"We come here often! The food is excellent and fresh. We have great service and enjoy the ambiance. They have delicious salsa and you can ask for one a bit hotter and wow it's great! They also have great lemonade!!

During the week they have very reasonable lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Sit on the patio and try the Chicken Mole! The patio is an incredible setting that makes you feel like you are in a locale far more opulent and exotic than downtown Chandler. Food is excellent, ambiance is great. Perhaps the best setting in the entire Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I think they have really good food....in fact i was so impressed by their food that I wanted to have my rehearsal dinner there. I called the first time - was told the manager would call me back, a week later - nothing. Then I called back again and was told I'd need to call back that the manager wasn't there. And I called back again and he wasn't there again...i finally gave up and reserved my party of 25 people elsewhere. Guess they didn't want our business."}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge suggested this place as a destination due to our large party size, and we were very happy she did.  The chips were outstanding, and we all have had our share of chips and salsa.  Our waiter was superb and his recommendations were all spot-on.  Everything ordered was fabulous.  

El Zocalo is quite the happening destination in not-so-sleepy historic Chandler; there were promgoers, oldsters and hipsters inside, outside on the patio, and lining up to get in the door.  It's loud and fun."}
{"text":"The worse place that i have done in the last 2 years. 

it took 15 min until then took our order , then the food came 50 min after,
half of the rest. was empty but the dont care. 
even talking with the manager didnt help ( of course he came after 15 min that we asked)

again  if you want to west a lot of time ( 1.5 - 2 hours ) to get food this is the place"}
{"text":"food is great!!!! service is good!! music , having me wana dance !!!! love this place always a good time latino style!!!"}
{"text":"I just got totally ripped off.  When I got the check I put half cash and my debit card thinking they would only charge the balance on my card..well They charged the whole bill on my card and said there was no cash in the binder!  When the manager came over he looked like a total idiot and all he could say was that the waiter was really good and couldn't have taken my money.  NEVER EVER going back there, total crooks!  Now I get to fight this through my bank..and the food really isn't that great...."}
{"text":"I love El Zocalo. I work across the street and get their lunch special every couple weeks. They have my all time favorite chips and salsa and a really cool patio. Food can be pricey, but if you stick to the specials you'll be fine. Margaritas are not my favorite, but are not bad by any means. 

As an FYI, I don't write long drawn out reviews. I do my best to manage my expectations, i.e. I do not expect Ritz Carlton quality service at every road side McDonalds. Feel free to take any of my reviews with a grain of salt, if this contradicts your own values."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience last night!!!

I write this review very disappointed as El Zocalo has been a favorite of mine for the 5 years I have lived in AZ.  So when my husband asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, I suggested this would be a great place for a group...WRONG!

First, they do NOT take reservations.  My husband found this out when he called the Wednesday before to make reservations for our group of 18.  He was told that although they do not take reservations, he was welcome to come by the restaurant 2 hours before the dinner on Saturday, and they would start setting up a space.  However, last night he called before heading down there, and was told that he had been misinformed - they will only seat on a first come, first serve basis with the majority of your party present.  This was fine at the time, as they assured us that they handle groups of this size with no problem every night.  From the service we received, I find this hard to believe.

When we arrived, the patio was the only choice...again they assured us that they could sit us in front of misters and it would be quite pleasant...WRONG again!  They sat us in a corner, as far away from any misters in sight as we could possibly be. Fine...as the sun went down it seemed cool enough so we overlooked it.

However, the waitstaff that were assigned to our table acted so completey overwhelmed by a group of our size I find it hard to believe they ever manage large groups well.  Needless to say the rest of the evening was a mishap of errors.  Two of our entrees didn't show up with the rest of the 16 - including mine.  I had ordered the chicken enchiladas, and beef showed up - the waiter insisted that is what I had ordered and basically tried to force it upon me before accepting the mistake and admitting he had written it down wrong.  And I had even had a fairly lengthy discussion with the waiter while ordering - not sure how he ended up writing it down completely incorrect.  My entree finally showed up about 10 minutes after everyone had started eating - and it was subpar at that.  I order the same thing every time, so I am familiar with the dish.  However, it was obvious the kitchen had rushed it at the expense of quality.  But at least I received mine - the other individual in our party still had to ask for his entree another 2 times before it finally showed up.  And when the waiter plopped it down in front of him, he said \"better late than never\"...without any sort of apology.  Nor did they make any attempt to discount those entrees...not only that, they even charged my husband for the \"birthday\" flan he had ordered. And throughout the dinner, the service was bad.  We had to repeatedly ask to order more margaritas, etc...most restaurants can't wait to serve you alcohol as it increases the value of the bill.

So that wasn't the end of it...paying the bill was in itself a debacle.  Of course, they did not make any attempt to split it and make it easier - although we had warned them that they would receive payments from multiple parties.  As we were having a hard time totalling it all up, the waiter offered to try and help.  However, when he took the final bill and brought it back, his \"help\" had resulted in a $45 increase!  What the heck?!  So that was really the last straw and I went to ask the manager.  From my brief interaction with him, it is obvious that bad service trickles down from the top.  When I tried to explain the situation of the magically increasing bill, he didn't even speak - just ripped the two unreconciled bills out of my hand and turned his back on me.  Wow!  FINALLY, afer ONE HOUR of trying to pay the bill, we were free!  Longest birthday dinner EVER!!!  And it was my birthday!

Still we never received any sort of apology, or attempt at making things better...shocking for having brought a party of 18 to their business.  And to add insult to injury, my husband was up all night with food poisoining!!!  He had ordered the shrimp relleno highly recommended by the waitstaff.  Needless to say, it tasted good, but order at your own risk!!!

So, not quite sure what has happened at El Zocalo, but it was TERRIBLE. Again very disappointed at it was previously a restaurant I had highly recommended.  Proceed at your own risk!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not particularly exciting or diverse.  I usually go here for the atmosphere and location.  It's a great place to hang out when you're in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"How can a Mexican restaurant this close to Mexico be so average? Service was great, food was like so many other places. I had the Fajitas and a Margarita."}
{"text":"I have to say....the drummed down happy hour and smaller portions and higher prices says it all. Used to like this place but they seem to have a \"we can do what we want and they will come\" attitude. Well this lady ain't coming again. Food is good but ruined by me above mentioned."}
{"text":"It was our first time to visiting ,it was cute decor . Love the patio , the soloist musician was great. The service was good. Our server advise us that our food was going to be 45 minutes wait. We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band . We actually stay  a little bit more just to hear the band . so we decide if we want to listen to some great music we will go , but if we wanted to eat great mexican food we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Me and my sis came from out of town (California) and we were looking for a place to dance and have a few drinks!!! It was a blast!!!! The bill was surprisingly cheap for 2 patron shots and a beer!!! Good place for good vibes!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and management. The night was beautiful,  patio and atmosphere... gorgeous!!! We were so excited to enjoy a night outside with friends. When we were quoted 30 minutes to wait.. we were happy. We sat outside and enjoyed a cocktail. After waiting 45 minutes, we checked in.... this is where the trouble started. Long and short..... we waited an hour, we asked approximate time and the host responded , \" I don't know how long it takes for people to eat\" ... another 15 passes and I speak to the manager. He is horrid!!!! Cares nothing for my feedback. We finally sit, hair in the salsa.. !! I could not make this up. We decided to leave and not continue the pain. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Outside of the patio, not much to attract me to this place.  It is way too pricey for food that isn't any different or any better than any other Mexican place."}
{"text":"Honestly I cannot remember a time I was more dissapointed with an establishment.  They gave away our table for 10 and after an hour of waiting we were told \"We don't have NO tables.\"  I get that we live in AZ and we won't fund our schools but come on.  Then we were advised it would be another 45 minutes.  We ordered a few appetizers at the bar, which were cold and disgusting when served to us.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the authentic enchiladas and they were very nice and if the weather is nice then plan to eat on the back courtyard"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, bar was set low with the 3of5  but definitely should be 6of5"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and would not return. Service was incredibly slow. Even worse, a server dropped a drink and another server berated him in front of all the diners. Tacky. 

The atmosphere is nice, but the food took forever to arrive, almost 45 minutes! It was decent but not great and was pricy for what it was. There are much better options out there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere outside.  Good food.  Prices might be a little high but not astronomical."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner. Loved the Aztecs Chicken tortilla soup. Chicken tacos reminded me of our trip to Mazatlan years ago. Very tasty. Chili Verde also good; spicy.  Liked the decor and atmosphere.  Service attentive."}
{"text":"The patio here cannot be beat. It is a perfect date spot. They have small lights all over and you feel like you are no where near Chandler, AZ. 
The live music they have is always good. The prices are a tad high but that is the cost of great ambiance I guess. I had the chicken enchiladas and they were very good. You can tell that the sauces are homemade and the black beans were spot on. 
This is my favorite spot in Downtown Chandler no question."}
{"text":"Food is Ok, but it's really about the ambiance.  It's not really the same if you don't sit on the patio.  I would venture to say not worth it.  I would rate it three stars if you have to sit inside.  On the back patio, there are tables nestled into nooks and surrounded by fruit trees and bushes.  Decor makes you feel like you're in a romantic Mexican locale.  Twinkly lights in the trees, fans in the summer, heaters in the cooler months.  Often there's Latin music (in tonight's case, Latin, rock and country), which adds to the atmosphere.  Can be festive or romantic.  The tree blossoms smelled great tonight!     

The best thing I've had there is the shrimp quesadilla.  The shrimp enchiladas as just Ok; hubby's shrimp chile relleno was just \"alright.\"  They have an excellent salsa (they're owned by the same folks who own El Sol Bakery, who sells their salsa at Whole Foods and Walmart).  I got a raspberry swirl margarita, and it was overly sweet, a bit koolaidy.  That didn't prevent me from drinking the whole thing!  :-)  I really like that some of their glassware is from DiSciacca, a cool glass shop in Downtown Chandler.

Zocalo definitely DOESN'T take reservations.  They tell you this in their opening spiel if you call.  Got there at about 6:20 tonight, and the wait for the patio was about 30 minutes, maybe a bit less.  It definitely gets longer.  You can wait at the bar or outside on the patio, there are chairs and benches in front of the band or person playing music.  I was a little annoyed tonight at the musician.  At one point he urged people who were finished with their meals to give up their tables and go sit on the benches/chairs near where he was.  He said that they had asked him to encourage folks to do this.  Whatever!  I'll give up my table when I'm good and ready.    

Anyway, I can always count on a nice night out with friends or a loved one at Zocalo.  Food is just ok, but the patio rocks."}
{"text":"After asking some local folk where to get good Mexican food, we ended up at El Zocalo. The food was fresh and authentic. The margarita's were great. We ate out in the patio area. Even though it was 100 degrees, it was comfortable with an evening breeze. Excellent service. Reasonable prices. Just lovely!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in chandler. Classy so don't think you are going to elmers people. Keep up the great work de la Cruz familia!"}
{"text":"The place rocks. Great Mexican , but processed high."}
{"text":"Great service. Our waiter Jared was awesome. The food was good. Ok prices- $55, plus tip for 2 meals and 3 drinks. Their patio is amazing though! So beautiful."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about their food, it is absolutely to DIE for.  This would be the reason I originally chose to have my bridal shower here,  the food and their beautiful patio.  We had been working with Kyle since mid June on dates and times.  We settled on a date and time with the agreement to reserve the entire patio.  I was so excited, amazing salsa, tasty margaritas and special memories for my special day.  This all came to a screeching halt with my followup call to Kyle today.  I'm fairly sure he double booked the patio, but have no proof other than the fact that he didn't remember a thing (even though we corresponded via several emails) then after several hours and endless questions he calls me back to let me know we could have only a small part of the patio.  I didn't want \"part\" of a patio I reserved the ENTIRE patio but now he decided it was his \"busy time of year\" and that would no longer be an option.  BEWARE if you are attempting to have a large party here, the catering kid, Kyle, needs to brush up on his customer service skills."}
{"text":"So unfortunate that this place has pretty decent food but horrible, horrible service."}
{"text":"Patio is beautiful but food is not even mediocre. Nothing exciting or unique in menu. Customer service is terrible, my order was not put in,  which I know can happen, but the staff did not apologize at all for mistake or tried to rectify. Asked for more tortillas and they never brought. Almost like server was drunk, he kept dropping request after request and was slurring his words. Strange. Do not recommend which is too bad because we love supporting small local businesses."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague!  Horrible service, mediocre food, terrible management.

Took 4 hours to eat, and the experience was less than memorable."}
{"text":"I though that this restaurant was decent, although definitely not my favorite as far as Mexican food goes.  The location is nice, as it is located in beautiful downtown Chandler. I had the Avocado Torta.  It was decent, but nothing special.  I would even say it was a little on the bland side as far as Mexican goes.  The service was adequate, but nothing remarkable.  Would I come here again?  Sure. However, I'm not rushing to go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Arizona.  The food is very tasty with average portions.  They make everything fresh so there is no \"slop spooned out of a bucket\" like you'll find at a chain.  The carne asada burritos and chicken quesadillas are unbelievable.  We were actually going to have our wedding on the patio, but they jacked up the price at the last minute so we backed out.  But we don't let that ruin our opinion of the food and elegant atmosphere.  The place is PACKED on the weekends, so be prepared to wait.  

REVISION:  I ate there last night for the first time in a year.  The prices have skyrocketed.  Apparently the owners have gotten a little greedy with their success.  A $6 burrito last year is now $12.  While I still highly recommend this place, it is now more expensive."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant was rated lower than four, as our meal was just wonderful. Service was attentive enough -Little pricey after adding on margaritas and flan but taste wise and service we can not complain. We stumbled upon it by accident but will be back on purpose.    We had enchiladas de pollo and mole de pollo for our main dishes. I tried a Margarita called Flaco Skinny and thought it called for a second taste test, olé!  Also includes  music on Thursdays and Fridays."}
{"text":"We went there last Saturday night (April 8th) Extremely disappointed. The only reason I am giving them 1 star is the food was decent. 
The service was horrible. We waited close to 15 minutes to get a drink. Once we finished and the waitress picked up our check we had 2 credit cards in there and said to split it.  After 20 minutes of waiting the waitress came back to inform us that the internet was down and they couldn't process the credit cards.   She the just left.  Any good customer service establishment would have offered us a drink on the house while we waited. Another 20 minutes pass and  she comes back with the old fashioned paper that they ran our card on.  The bill was split between us and the other couple. BUT WAIT.  I checked my account Monday just because I figured something would happen. I had two transactions from them for the full amount.  One has cleared and they added a $20 tip onto the bill. The other couple was not charged.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Great outdoor patio. Quiet enough for a group of old people to hear all the conversation"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the back patio is fabulous for dining outside!  The flavor if my enchilada de Cameron was on the bland side."}
{"text":"4 stars mainly because of the back patio, one of the nicest in Chandler. Food is average mexican, chips and salsa are decent. Service is advertised to be slow (menu says it takes time to make good food or something like that) and that's true."}
{"text":"Food was okay you can tell that they are trying to cut food cost by cutting back the quantity of ingredients. I order the rellano de pollo but never really found the pollo. My wife got the shrimp burrito and ate half the burrito before finding her first shrimp. On top of it all we were automatically auto-gratuity 20% for poor service. Don't think I will be going back"}
{"text":"Love the modern look to this place and is very good food. Love the Mole sauce, chips are nice and thick. The shrimp enchilada's are also great. Just moved to area and have been twice."}
{"text":"Hopped in here during a Wednesday night bar crawl. I guess Wednesday night isn't a happening night here. Perfect if you want a quiet place to talk to an old friend, have some drinks and not be bothered or let the atmosphere get in the way of your conversation. But we were four drunks on the road to nowhere and we each had one drink at the bar then decided the kitchen (where we could hear all the wild conversations going on through the door) was the most happening thing at this place so we voted to move on. Might come back if I need a quiet bar sometime. Noted. It's in the rectangular area between Buffalo Street and Boston Street and between San Marcos Place and North Arizona Place. Plenty of parking all over during a regular night. Weekends and during events, your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Yea this spot is nice to go out on a friday and saturday night, i think fridays are the best becasue you can go have some dinner and then while your eating outside  in a very nice patio there is a guy who is singing and doing comedy,then at 9 thw band and DJ singing foavorite old school, disco, top 40 and other classsic up beat songs to get you dancing on a v crowded dance floor"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE PLACE ON EARTH!!!  this is chandlers best kept secret :0)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.. every time had to pay a cover and every time I was left wondering why I came back... bar staff was acceptable however the place is swarming with \"security\" who decided based on home much they like you weather you will be warmly accepted or feel like an outcast. Had a few less than stellar experiences here. Don't expect to be your self as a recent example I decided to wear a sports hat with my leather jacket as a normal fashion statement however this was more than discouraged as I obviously was \"gang affiliated\" per the security staff where as the gentleman on the dance floor wearing a newsboy hat with the 49'rs logo was more than welcome. So no hats unless they like the sports team or if you're in with the staff and close to the \"security\" or if you work here  it's ok.."}
{"text":"So - I must say, our experience was probably prompted by less than desirable seating by the hostess.  It was a cold night so we opted to sit inside.  However, we were seated directly in front of the door to the patio.  A frequently used door by staff and patrons blowing cold air directly on us.  Yes, we could have asked to been moved, but it was a conversation piece!
Our waiter took forever to get to our table, and didn't have a busy section.  He came to our table with \"Sorry it took me so long to get over, but at least I got here!\".  
We were both dying for the Machos Nachos, however he forgot this order and only brought our entrees.  The wine I had was great, and my fellow had a kickbutt martini.  
Chips and nachos, yumm.
The Pollo Asado was good, not great.  He had the carne asada tacos...but didn't even dive in to the second one, so I can't say they were amazing.  
However...the sopapillas were a little bit of heaven and I had trouble sharing.

Overall - meh.  The food was good, not great and the waitstaff leave something to be desired.  I have been here previously and the tacos on the patio are a great late night snack with a beer!"}
{"text":"Food was good !!! Killer chimi is the bestest!!!! Unless you a table of 6 who automatically has to pay 20 percent gratitute get ready to wait 25 minutes for water and chips to be refilled. They have 6 servers waiters , waiting around that could make better use of their time  like fill eater, clean tables. Manager was responsive one we asked for hom, obviously the waiter was not overwhelmed he just focused on who os giving the tip ...even kept 61cents of my change when i paid the bill, still gave a good tip . Will ask for someone else next time"}
{"text":"I have lived in Chandler for probably around eight years, and I've eaten at this restaurant countless times. Much less in the recent two years. The patio is really charming which is about the nicest thing I have to say. The inside of the restaurant is SUPER NOISY. And it seems like every time I come here to eat, the prices have gone up and the food tastes worse. 
It's really too bad because this could be a real star in the downtown Chandler scene. Instead, it's a consistent disappoinment."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is sooo nice!  Mellow music, great patio, great service!  Chile verde is some of the best I've had!  Flour tortillas are real.  Very, very good!"}
{"text":"Really expensive for what it is. Nice looking place with really average food.

Would be awesome for a place to get this spot that had some really fine type of Mexican food like Dicks or Elote.

The service was quite bad also. Decent happy hour food but happy Margaritas at $8 is not exactly a great deal"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very authentic. Jamie the bartender makes perfect margaritas and is very pleasant. Patio has a great atmosphere at night. A little pricey but worth it once in awhile."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is very charming with lots of beautiful plants, trees, fountains, authentic looking outdoor oven and comfortable patio furniture. It sets the ambience for a relaxed dining experience, which might compensate for mediocre food and service. It's worth a visit to relax on the patio. Parking is convenient."}
{"text":"Good Mexican place with cool outdoor seating.

The Shrimp Relleno and the Carne Asada are standouts.

Plenty of tequilas to choose from as well."}
{"text":"First time here! The host was very welcoming.

Our server, Bethany,  was very nice. She attended to all of our needs quick and accurately.

The atmosphere was perfect. It had Mexican music that made you wanna dance and outside patio seating! 

I ordered shrimp fajitas, borracho beans, and Spanish rice. My meal was very satisfying and flavorful. It will never measure up to my mother's cooking, and that's the reason for four stars but overall great service!"}
{"text":"5 ladies
10 cadillac margaritas
2 pollo quesdillas, ahi tuna tacos, burrito combo # 2, burrito with salsa verde
HUGE bill.

The food was delicious, the drinks were strong. A bit pricey tho for mexican food. Seemed like it was quicker to go get a drink from the bar than to order it from the server. This place is good for groups."}
{"text":"We went for a change of pace for happy hour. Kind of pretentious for what you get. Sat in the patio which was nice, although the birds were a bit aggressive. 

Overall my biggest problems were:
1) Margaritas menu doesn't have prices on it, but the waiter casually mentions one costs $30. I really do like to know the cost ahead of time.
2) Nothing (& keep in mind I got three menus) said that starters were 1/2 price for happy hour until we got the bill.

Other than those two things, the evening was fine, certainly not spectacular.  Those two things,however,  were irritating enough to mark this place down from a 4 to a 3."}
{"text":"Originally, my girlfriend and I wanted to go get a drink at San Tan Brewery next door, but it seemed like they were very noisy and we had a lot of catching up to do, so we ventured for El Zocalo instead, it seemed more chill.

As we walked through the layout inside, I thought it was pretty small, but then when we walked out to the patio, it was like finding a pretty little Mexico back there. Quite spacious and beautiful patio, with real fruit trees, brick oven, and nice decor overall..

We tried the recommended Cadillac Margaritas and I had the steak fajitas.. steak could have been more tender and I wish they gave me more than 2 tortillas, BUT pretty good dish since it was loaded with everything. As we were leaving, people inside were dancing to salsa with a DJ, so if you're into that kind of thing, you should go Saturday nights.

I wanna go back already."}
{"text":"El Zocalo has recently started to disappoint in a few regards:

1.) They are now closed on Sundays. What? Seriously? Why? What normal mexican restaurant is closed on Sundays? That is the best, biggest, busiest day of the week and they are suddenly closed...this is a huge bummer and a really bad business move, I'm sorry to say but this is just nonsense. And this just happened too, it wasn't planned or announced online or anywhere and a makeshift \"closed\" paper was put over the sunday on the window hours.

2.) They are now closed on Mondays...yeah, another fun one. 2 days of the week closed is just ridiculous...

3.) They wash the tables down with windex and paper towels...That is not standard health code, it's awkward and it doesn't do the job. Tables must be washed down with sanitizer water/ammonia water and a clean white rag, not blue windex and paper towels. Sorry to nitpick here but safety comes first, it's not safe or smart to pump windex mist all over the place in a busy dining room full of guests and open plates. Use sanitizer or the proper quaternary ammonia solution! This isn't a suggestion, it is health code!!!

The carne asada is still pretty delicious. OPEN ON SUNDAYS! What are you guys doing!?"}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey.  Company was awesome.  Nice atmosphere.  Outside garden area was nice but it's too hot in Arizona to really enjoy"}
{"text":"Carlos the bartender was real nice. Thought this place was empty but once you walk in you see the packed patio. Came in and it was happy hour.not a bad thing but nothing special really. Had a pretty good appetizer in the stuffed quesadilla."}
{"text":"We live near downtown chandler and always go there for lunch and dinners. Went to El Zocalo for the first time and it was AMAZING. I love my dive shop Mexican food usually but this nice sit down restaurant had a nice atmosphere and family friendly, inside and outside. You can tell how good the place is based on chips and salsa at first in my opinion and this one hit it out of the park with everything including margaritas.  Service was good and it's low key and delish! I loved the location and the food. The prices are average sit down prices so not bad. I will surely be back regularly."}
{"text":"despite the horrible reviews that were quite awful, we visited this place to eat while in town. I can say, I'm extremely happy we did! We had a 45 minute wait since there was an art festival going on, but decided after walking around for 15 minutes at the festival to try our luck at the bar. We ordered the Shredded Beef Chimichanga and Chicken Relleno. I substituted the poblano sauce on my Relleno. The food was awesome. The service was good and we did not get any crazy diseases from eating here nor were we treated poorly. Hopefully this review will help other out of towners not give in to those crazy reviews about their \"horrible\" experience at this place. Also, for those who like, this place turns into a night club open until 4:30 AM if you are into that sort of entertainment"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced for food that is mediocre. Crappy service when I went, all the waiters were just chatting with each other the entire time. Bleh."}
{"text":"The ensalada de zocalo was AMAZING!! Great healthy alternative at a great Mexican place! The atmosphere is cozy and very welcoming. Jaime was my server gave great recommendations!! Chips and salsa by far the BEST!! My friend had the chile verde burrito OMG this burrito is a MUST  HAVE!! Server informed me that they have  half off appetizers and drink specials! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, solid-tasting dishes for your money, definitely nothing to die for.  The wine bar and the back patio are the best part of the experience - tables amongst a paved walkway + fountain, soft lighting.. On certain nights there is live music on the back patio."}
{"text":"Seated right away on a Saturday night at 7ish, took a bit for our server to make his way over, resturant was 3/4 full. Ordered our drinks, again took awhile for server to bring them, ordered meals and they came surprisingly quick bit they weren't terribly complicated. Food was ok....not bad not best ever, just ok. If my review ends here it may have been a 3 or possibly 4 stars but.....our drink glasses sat empty on edge of table for TWENTY MINUTES!!! Our server disappeared. We thought maybe he quit or was fired, never saw him in dining room for 20 mins! Then the manager (assumption here) was cleaning nearby tables w a Windex spray bottle and several times we were misted w Windex......really dude!??! Server FINALLY came and offered drink refills as we had already stacked all of the empty and dirty dishes on very edge of table to convey a subtle message. Nowhere near good enough food for the shitty service. Will not make 2nd trip here."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonably priced, though the tacos are out of this world. The service is warm and attentive. Now couple that with margaritas on a patio covered with a canopy of fragrant citrus, flanked with blooming bougainvillea, and you're in heaven. We recomend the shrimp appetizer. Their pollo and carne asado are intensely flavorful too. The salsa is served chilled (not my fave), but it's done well. If I were to change anything, it would be the corn chips. They are clearly fried fresh, but I really prefer the out of a bag, salty and not oily variety. We live in Gilbert but prefer to come to Chandler for this particular restaurant on a regular basis. It's wonderfully located, very close to Ice Cream Sammies. Need I say more? Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best fajita I have ever had. I ordered the combo, steak/shrimp/chicken. AMAZING.  I highly recommend this place. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from Hilton Phoenix Chandler
It was kind of strange but the food all came out at different times and a couple of plates came out 10 mins after the first group. Once every thing was out we all agreed the food was very bland and was lacking seasoning. For $20 roughly per plate the food was very average and informed the hotel that of this experience."}
{"text":"We found our visit here to be outstanding. The food is delicious and we were able to sit and enjoy a gorgeous afternoon on a beautiful patio! What a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars!!! It's an all time favorite. The service is fast, and extremely friendly. The food is extremely tasty and I guarantee it will satisfy anyone's appetite. I highly recommend to all who live in the immediate area."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere are good, but the prices are a joke considering it is downtown chandler. I've had friends say their food has been bad, but mine has always been good. 

Oh yea, and charging for chips....WEAK. Unforgiveable actually."}
{"text":"Went to El Zocalo tonight to enjoy some good food and also enjoy the ambiance with my wife. I have been to this establishment before and never remembered if the food was good or not. I ordered the Tierra y Mar plate which is steak and shrimp on the grill with a side of rice and beans. I asked for my steak to be done medium, when we received our orders seemed to be 35 minutes later my steak was well done and had not an ounce of flavor to it. The shrimp was so salty I could only eat but one. When the waiter finally came back to see how it was going I told him that I was not happy with the plate. He asked if I wanted something else and I refused. I had tried my wife's plate (chicken Enchiladas) and it was mediocre so I wasn't going to waste my time. At the end of the night the waiter apologized and said that the manager discounted my plate 50%. Why the manager didn't come out to see what I thought was wrong is beyond me. Honestly the only reason I will go back is for the music and the beer, my food experience was sub-par. For the price save yourself some money and go to Rosita's in Mesa or El Rico's in Gilbert. 
Terrible food experience."}
{"text":"We've been in 3 times now and have had a great experience each time.  Everything we have ordered has been fresh and delicious. Last night I tried the Cadillac Margarita and it was honestly the BEST margarita I have ever had in my life.  This is a great spot to bring out of town guests due to the down town area.
Only downside, which is not the restaurant's fault, is the parking.  It can be a little tough to find a spot.
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go here a couple times before giving a definitive review.  My initial gut reaction is that the place is a little pricey for Mexican food, but after going there a couple more times I think the atmosphere and quality definitely warrants the higher price range.

Speaking of atmosphere, this place is great!  That is probably why there is generally a wait on the big-ticket nights, but it's well worth hanging out in the bar for a few drinks.  If you can get a seat at the bar the bartenders will happily let you eat dinner there as well, which is a nice way to skip the wait.  Both times I've been there the live music was a great touch.  It's not uncommon to find a man playing guitar on the super-nice patio, or a full band playing in the main dining area.  Everyone around seems to generally be in a good mood, and the margaritas are definitely good.

I've had the tacos and the fajitas and both were excellent.  Tacos will run you in the $14/15 area, and fajitas are $17 but there was enough food including the beans and rice to take home some leftovers.

I would gladly head back to El Zocalo for grabbing a little Mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Just don't make the mistake of wearing shorts and a t-shirt with sandals like I did because you'll stick out like a sore thumb!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Arizona. I was so sad when we moved away, and we still visit chandler just for this amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Dined for dinner at 5pm on Sunday and ordered ice tea, the shrimp appetizer and shrimp relleno.  Waiter returned shortly to inform us they were out of ice tea?? o.k. he made a recommendation of lemonade since we were not drinking margaritas. I thought no biggie he made a recommendation and the lemonade was refreshing.  Waiter returned about 5 minutes later to tell us the poblano sauce for the relleno is not ready so we could either have it with green sauce or order something else.  Green sauce?? No thanks!  Asked for the appetizer first while we glanced over the menu.  Shrimp appetizer arrived and looked AND tasted like a boxed breaded oven baked shrimp.  Placed our order for the chili verde.  Let's just say it was a complete disappointment when arrived. For $16 the rice and beans (borrocho)  tasted nothing special and the chili verde was a measly portion that could have come from a can. This is way over priced food that would be better served for under $10. Filiberto's has much better quality and quantity of food than El Zocalo.  Save your time and $$ and go to Abuelo's if you are wanting Mexican food.  For all the disappointments of being out of something as simple as ice tea and a sauce used for multiple dishes, the waiter made no extension of making up for it. Maybe it could have changed my mind for the place and I would have given two stars."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for a few years but the last few visits we have been so disappointed in the food ! The tortillas are not as fresh as they used to be ... They changed the taste of my favorite dinner so I may have to explore other Mexican food restaurants in the area .."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place has THE worst management ever!!!

We had a party of 35, which I was told twice over the phone that they would be able to accommodate and that once half of our party was present, we would be seated. When we got there with half of our party, we were told by the manager that our whole party needed to be present to be seated. I let the manager know what I was told over the phone and that his employees misinformed me, and he did not seem to care at all.

Our entire party was present after an hour of waiting, yet we still weren't seated due to them not having enough tables available. It took 1.75 hours for our entire party to be seated! We were all seated on the patio, but all at different tables nowhere near each other, yet each table was all charged the 20% gratuity since according to them, we were all considered part of the same party, which to me makes no sense at all. On top of everything, our server didn't check up on our table one time during our meal. Is it really this hard to find good customer service nowadays?!

I spoke to the manager, Kyle, on our way out and asked him why I was initially misinformed about large parties. He said he wasn't sure why and did not even seem to care. I also asked why we were charged gratuity when we were clearly not seated anywhere close to each other. He had no answer. He said he was able to push some tables close together which he clealy did not do because \"the restaurant would lose space.\" Why did it matter the space when we took up the entire half of the patio anyways was beyond my understanding. I also let him know Yelp said the accept reservations, which they clealy don't. He said their Tech people are working on correcting that. Riiiiiiight buddy...

The manager was not apologetic at all and did nothing to make the situation any better. If anything, all he showed was that they took our comined bills of over $1,000 and did not care for our business again. 

As much as I love the food, patio and ambiance, I will NEVER recommend this establishment again, especially for a large party. Extremely disappointed in tonight's outcome."}
{"text":"We always love the patio seating. The food is always fresh and good. Never had a bad experience with the staff or food at all. We come every now then for lunch."}
{"text":"The prices are very high. We love this family's food and enjoy eating at El Sol and El Rico's. I must say I was really disappointed in the service and the prices were crazy. At El Rico's, you get twice the amount for 
half the price. The beans tasted like they were from a can and all the food was really salty. The prices and the service made this a bad experience and I wont be back. And the sopapillas are more like doughnuts..gross"}
{"text":"As you enter the restaurant a sign demands you enjoy the \"award winning\" patio.  Do as the sign says!  We were lead through the dinning area to a beautiful courtyard with lush trees and warm lighting.  Most tables were full but they are arranged in such a way that you can still enjoy a private conversation.  It reminded me of a Mexican version of Disney's Blue Bayou.  It was so enjoyable I did not mind at all paying the almost crazy prices for our meal and would return again.  I enjoyed good beans, excellent rice, passable chicken mole and a very well made drink."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my husband.  Our waiter was great!  Friendly, attentive and pleasant.  Chips were good but salsa was not hot at all.  Asked for something hotter and brought out a fresh green salsa that was a bit hotter but not much.  

My husband had the ceviché which was good and I had the shrimp tacos which were ok.  Thought the prices were a bit high but it was good for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I could give negative stars, I would.  I created an account just to share how HORRIBLE the service was here.  15 of my friends attended a birthday celebration 2 weeks ago and El Zocalo failed miserably to provide any decent form of SERVICE.  Here are the main reasons why:

1) 6 guests waited over 90 minutes for food!
2) The reservation was for 10 and the manager said they \"accomodated\" us by not making the additional guests wait for another table.
3) We could not pay the check with more than 8 credit cards
4) Chips, salsa & water refills were non existent
5) Manager argued back that the food took ONLY 45 minutes.  Really?  Since when is 45 minutes any more acceptable and what happened to the customer is always right?  
6) After waiting an additional 90 minutes for the owner to appear and after already having paid the bill in full (plus 18% gratuity!), the owner finally comes out with an attitude and no intent to offer any restitution.  She concludes by insulting the birthday girl and we were done for the night.  

Who does that to their own customers???  Clearly they weren't concerned about retaining business.  I can't comment on the food b/c I asked for chips & salsa & never got it, therefore didn't even order dinner.  I will NEVER again step foot into this place.

Best of luck to those who venture there and remember to bring cash & a bad attitude!"}
{"text":"Food is good and so is the ambiance. The host seated us and we waited about 20min before we had to wave a server down to help us. The server came to us looking confused thinking we had already been helped. The food came out at an ok time, had to wait for our drinks in the hot sun for a while. Seemed as if the server dreaded to work the patio so took his time coming to attend to us. I've been here before a few times but this time, the service experience was not the best.  :("}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is the portion size. I feel they are small compared to what you pay. I would say the food was good, not great. 
There was a guitarist outside on the patio that was fun. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and all the workers were friendly."}
{"text":"I'm very mixed...  We dined on 1/21 around 6:30 pm.

5 stars- our server Mike was great-- funny, helpful
4 stars- the chile rellenos and carne asada were amazing; patio is beautiful
3 stars- guac and bean dip were a-okay.  nothing great, not terrible. fine.

1 stars-- there were a ton of heaters on the patio, but when we were initially sat , we asked our hostess to turn it on, she said they were out of propane.  When I asked Mike an hour later to be re-sat indoors when we were beyond freezing, he promptly turned one of the heaters on and lit a fire.  I HATE being lied to.  Also, it took about 10+ minutes to see our server at the beginning.  We had to ask 3 times for a high chair.  We also had our appetizers before we had our drinks and side plates.

It's sad that entrees are around 20/each, we had a bottle of wine, and 2 appetizers, and an otherwise good situation, but those blunders really soured me on the place."}
{"text":"WOW!  We go to El Zocalo fairly often have always enjoyed the ambience of the patio and the food.  The patio in the July or January is still wonderful - very pretty, private... and live music on Fri/Sat.  A little more expensive, but the patio is such a beautiful eve spot.  Hang out after or before dinner -  sit around the fountain and enjoy a drink and music."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really wonderful. We sat out on the patio for dinner and it's set up very well with nice lighting and the tables well-spaced. Unfortunately I have to take one star off immediately for the very strong smell of Windex about every 5 minutes. I wish restaurant owners would get the message that this stuff really smells bad and is especially unwelcome in the middle of a nice dinner. I understand they want this glass top tables to be clean and streak free but that smell in the middle of a chicken taco is just not acceptable. It is my rule when I experience that  I will never go back for anything other than take out. Anyway I ordered chicken tacos and a side of guacamole. I was slightly underwhelmed by both.  There did not seem to be very much chicken on the two tacos and the guacamole was also a very small serving. The service was pleasant but not especially attentive."}
{"text":"Service 5 star!  Husband loved the food 4 star ( although I think that's generous as I didn't like the food as much as he did).  Prices and portions are a little skewed.  This place is expensive & portions are not all that large (2star).
The Atmosphere is nice, especially outside.  parking Could be a problem if you go at the wrong time of day."}
{"text":"Looking for a Latin live band and vibrant environment?! This is the place. Indoor bar/restaurant and nice outdoor patio. Delicious Street tacos are served fresh from the grill on the outdoor patio for just a buck!"}
{"text":"15 minutes without a drink order being taken. Thanks for the free chips and salsa!
It seems that 1 star is too generous since I have nothing to base my review on other than stale chips and average tasting salsa."}
{"text":"Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike)."}
{"text":"Yummy charming spot. I am stuck on their Mexican Chicken salad, I wish I could remember the exact name but it's on the middle left of the back of the menu. Lol

My husband loves the carne asada and a friend said the fried ice cream and tortilla soup were very good too. Prices can be a tad high but it's in a tourist spot. 

Outdoor patio is charming and highly recommended."}
{"text":"We swung by after happy hour on a Friday, and were surprised that it wasn't busy and we were able to sit right down.  We chowed on the chips and salsa, and our waitress was happy to fill us up again.   For dinner, I had another yummy black bean and cheese burrito!  Everyone seemed pleased with their food and I just love quaint little downtown Chander.  

Now if only they served Z'Teja's margaritas here...."}
{"text":"I love El Zocalo! I wish this restaurant was a little bit closer to us, because we would visit more!"}
{"text":"The mole chicken entree.  Man O Man is that good!!!

Be sure to sit in the back courtyard.  Just beautiful."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The first was in 2004 when I visited on vacation, and then subsequent visits were when I actually lived in Arizona for a few years.

Food is okay; nothing to wholly rave about. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I like the back patio. It can fill up quick on weekends, but overall its okay."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars alone for their back patio (EAT THERE IF YOU ARE GOING) otherwise their food is pretty average at best and pricey for what you get. The service is always good, but every time I have been I always feel rushed. The good side is your food doesn't sit in the window getting cold, but the bad is you go from salsa, food, check super quickly. They charge you for refills of salsa/chips which is lame, considering every other Mexican restaurant gives them to you for free."}
{"text":"came here for lunch and ordered the fajitas. The place is pricey but the food was on point! Could not complain about the service, oliver helped out and was gave the best customer service ive receoved in a while. highly recommend"}
{"text":"The service is amazing! Try the chili relleno. The portions are large, the rice is awesome, but the margaritas are where it's at. Ask for Jason! He has great food recommendations and killer margs"}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business. Bad on us to skip the 30 minute wait at San Tan Brewery. We walked in this place at 12pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones here. Shoulda been our first clue. 

I think the hostess is actually dead.....ZERO personality. The wait staff is more concerned with amongst themselves which I guess is ok because no one is here! In short, don't waste you time. I can't imagine this over priced, horrible excuse for a Mexican Resturant will be around long. By the way, if I could have rated a 1/8 of a star I would have."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some good Mexican food and music, but after seating for over 15 minutes with out a server, water or anything we decided to walk out... Not sure what happened with the service, a waiter kept on walking by us, but never offer his help. We've loved this place since it open, it's unfortunate to see the poor service they have now."}
{"text":"Food?  A+ -- Shrimp Relleno, Chicken Enchiladas, Carne Asada Tacos, Shrimp Ceviche a MUST!!!!  Hot salsa?  1 of a kind!!!  Homemade daily.  Service?  A++  Hands down the BEST Mexican food in all of Chandler AND Phx!!"}
{"text":"$9 for a cheese quesadilla. Nothing with it it. No beans no rice no sour no tomatoes. Service was awful but the food was worse. I'm from out of town and all the other restaurants had an hour wait. This place had seats available.. Should of been my first clue. We told the server it was my daughters birthday and he forgot. He didn't come back to check if the food was ok. If I were you I would find another place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here a lot when we lived in chandler. Over the years we have been able to drop in from time to time, but this establishment has been on a steady decline. Saturday night being the last straw for me, we will not be returning. Came in at about 830p and ordered 2 el presidente margaritas, they were served in plastic solo cups. Before I could even finish my drink an employee wanted to take my chair away from me. There was no one in the entire place and you are chasing people out? I decided to keep my chair while I finished my drink, we were not offered food menus so I guess we were done.. the patio is nice, but el zocalo's shelf life has expired. There are so many new places going in around them, why would anyone subject themselves to this place?"}
{"text":"I have had really good experiences with this place.  The wait on a weeknight for the patio is INSANE.  The drinks are good (Mojitos!!) and I really love the Avocado Torta.  I think eating outside is a must though.  The live music is fun as well!"}
{"text":"My expectations were not met for food or service. This place was recommended by a friend so we were looking forward to the experience.  Arrived 5:00pm last Saturday.  We seated ourselves after waiting, but we were ignored by staff. Only one table was occupied, the place was not busy. We ordered  staple Mexican dishes. Chimichanga & a Fajita. Average at best. Chimi was chewy. Too many great Mexican spots to look forward to."}
{"text":"The only thing \"authentic\" about El Zocalo is the patio and live music by Freddie Duran.  The restaurant had a strikingly great vibe the moment I walked in.  Once we were seated I felt as though I was in Mexico- until the waiter came. Short story: The other IMPORTANT aspects of El Zocalo  need some revising.  To start, the waiter was less than enthused to be there. I think he only said 5 words to us the entire night.  Our drinks,the Cadillac Margarita, tasted like fruit juice, the guacamole appeared to frozen prior, and they CHARGE $1.50 for a side of El Tapatio!!!!  I will admit the shrimp enchiladas were tasty. But not worth going back for. 

I saw this restaurant in a magazine which listed it as being one of the top 85 restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I don't know who critiqued it, but they have obviously never  been to Mexico.  I gave the restaurant 2 stars.  Being a restaurant in downtown historic Chandler, with the name El Zocalo, you would think they have more to offer on a dessert menu than the Americanized Deep fried ice cream. When I hear the word \"Zocalo\" I think : busy, all encompassing, and D.F.  El Zocalo embodies the heart of Mexico City.  Hence such a big name for a restaurant with such a little taste.  The waiter told me they \"used to have Tres Leches\" for a week.  Then he said that no one ordered it.  ??"}
{"text":"An update to a previous review I thought was necessary.  Food and service were both excellent.  Well deserved 4 stars!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. 
The service is horrible, the food is average and the prices are outrageous. Especially when they pad your tab with extras you didn't order and then refuse to fix it.

I have been here several times. The patio is the best atmosphere you can find, very charming and beautiful however my most recent visit here was the worst, and was also my last- here's why:

We were seated in a back corner of the patio near the exit gate. It's not a bad spot until some idiot goes through the gate but doesn't close it behind them- leaving a view of the alley and trash behind the restaurant. Hello- put a spring on the gate so it closes itself, thats a cheap fix.

Our server was one of the worst I have ever encountered. I think a dead person would have had more personality.  He rarely stopped by our table (my drink was empty for most of our time there) and while we were waiting for our food he mysteriously dropped off an order of guacamole that we did not order. Before we could question this he ran off- leaving us with guacamole.... we figured perhaps that it came with our dinner, and we ate it, though it was incredibly bland. 

We waited an incredibly long time for our food. before our food arrived another server came by our table to drop off a SECOND guacamole, which we were able to inform her that we did not order- and she took it away. 

FINALLY the food arrived. it was ok. I've had much better food at much less \"upscale\" places than this. 

At any rate, when our waiter came by with our check we handed over our credit card without checking the bill. HUGE MISTAKE. Turns out that they added TWO extra margaritas (at $12 each) and TWO orders of guacamole (at$8 each) - now, we wer more than willing to pay for the guac we ate, even though we didn't order it, but our server was SO RUDE saying that there was nothing he could do becuase he had already run the credit card. (ever hear of a refund? apparently he had not) He offered no appology or offer to speak to management.  When we did speak to a manager, he seemed annoyed and told us the same thing. Huge lack of customer service or wanting to make things right.  Let's just say they lost 4 customers."}
{"text":"Ohhhh El Zocalo....where have you been mi amigo?
  I have been searching for this restaurant to savor for some time. I just didn't know its name. I sat at the bar since I was flying solo. I queried the camarero as to the different Tequilas in their selection. He said they had 250!!!! I couldn't sample them all so I asked for his guidance for a favorite. He suggested Don Parillo which was good. All I can say is suavamente.....it went down like turpentine with a hint of kerosene. No actually it was good, but this isn't your college chug a lug tequila. It was actually very funny because when he brought it out in a snifter the lady next to me asked what it was. I told her and she said....\"oh, I like Jose Cuervo\". 
  Anyway, for dinner I had the Pollo Asada which came covered in green chile. I didn't complain but never had it that way before. By the end of the meal and a Modelo Especial in hand listening to the live music of the troubadour, it took me back to a place far far away. Probably 100 miles south of here...somewhere.
  If you like traditional Mexican food, live music, knowledgeable bartenders, a huge selection of good to fine tequila, then look no further."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, both times sitting inside. I need to see what their patio looks like though since everyone has been going on about it. In any event, I have enjoyed the food very much both times. The first time, I had the ahi tuna tacos and they were very tasty and I actually felt like I was eating something good for me which is rare when eating Mexican food. The second time, I ordered the vegetarian torta. Never having a torta before, I wasnt sure what to expect but after having it at El Zocalo, I will be having it more often. The bread was delicious, soft and warm. Even though there was no meat, there was plenty of avocado which made it filling. Their black beans are pretty good and their rice has a unique flavor to it which I enjoyed. Chips and salsa are great as well. I love the flavor of their salsa with just the right amount of kick. Also, the chips are made fresh and you can tell they are tortilla that has been deep fried in house. The service was great both times. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit higher than most other Mexican places, they make their drinks pretty strong (I am a wimp when it comes to strong drinks), and their bean dip was simply ok. It was good when you mixed it with salsa but if you didnt have salsa, it would need something more. In any event, this is a place I would return to if I was looking for light Mexican food though not often because of the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to eat at El Zocalo on a Saturday night, so we arrived early due to crowded parking situation and weekend diners. When we showed up at 5:30, we were really pleased to find that there was no wait! **That should have been sign #1.**

Sign #2 followed shortly thereafter, when a host described the tortilla soup as \"obnoxiously delicious.\" Uh, ok... Anyway, nice guy, allowed us to choose one of the many open tables. Chips and salsa arrived promptly and our waitress introduced herself quickly. THIS IS WHERE ANYTHING POSITIVE ENDS. 

After introducing herself, she disappeared. A party of four was seated at the table next to us and got a different server. He was very efficient- they had waters, drinks, guacamole and their orders taken before we ever saw the server again. At my count, 9 tables were filled in the restaurant and there were 8 server-looking people milling around. Yeah. Our server had ONE table of 5 adults and one child... and sort of us, although she didn't do anything for us.

My wife and I don't like to make a scene, so we sat there patiently. I was just kind of staring in the direction of the host stand, hoping I could catch someone's eye. Saw the manager walk by (in his purple shirt) three or four times- EVERY time, his head was down looking at his phone. Finally, a nice guy came over and said, \"Is everything ok? Can I get you anything?\" I explained to him that our server had disappeared and that before he came to check on us, we were talking about just quietly leaving. He went to get the manager and the manager's response to my story about the other table being served so promptly was, \"Oh - ok - well let me go ahead and put that drink order in for you...\" as if THAT was the problem. 

HORRIBLE service and just not very smart things happening around the restaurant. 

I'll comment on the only things I experienced: the water tasted like bad Chandler water, the chips were very greasy and the salsa was below average. Menu was pretty basic but overpriced for the area and quality of environment. This is the first restaurant I ever walked out of - and I'll never walk in again.

By the way, we went over to San Tan Brewery, had to WAIT 20 minutes... and were THRILLED that we left El Zocalo. If you want Mexican, go across the street, pay half price, get good service... eat at Serrano's."}
{"text":"Been several times hoping for different results. Nice patio, fair drinks, overpriced bad bland food. Nothing much has changed in 8-9 years of coming."}
{"text":"A great spot for authentic Mexican food and a very cool atmosphere, especially if you sit out on the patio. We went on a Friday and it was hopping. Lot's of great margaritas on the menu but being a purist, I went for the Cadillac. Very tasty, especially as I got to number 3 & 4!
Started with the gucamole and it was excellent. Not too spicy with lot's of flavor. I had the carne asada and it was everything it was written up to be, cooked perfectly to medium rare, very tender & moist and a perfect portion. The chile verde was also excellent as was the verde chicken enchiladas and the chicken preparado. Right on track with flavors and portions perfect. For desert it was fried ice cream and sopaipillas that were close to the best I have ever had. 
We finished the night some excellent live  music while hoisting more beverages at the bar. It seriously was hard to find fault with anything here. Great fast service, even on a busy Friday night. It was a bit warm on the patio but very manageable with lot's of beverages. 
A must for locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"El Zocalo was the first place I ate after moving to Chandler. My expectations were so low that my original review was to high! I've eaten at Zocalo's three times since then. The only thing \"exceptional\" that I've had on the menu is the soup. And it is exceptional. Everything else I've tried was just \"okay\" including the salsa's. The steel patio type charis are uncomfortable and the service is slow. the last couple times i've been in the young male servers spend their time at the railing talking to the bartender looking bored and no one out helping customers. But again... i do love the soup!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Food in Chandler. The outside patio is beautiful for guests when they come to visit!!"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio was packed so we sat inside. You could still hear the music and we were seated promptly. Drinks & dinner were delicious but the service was oh so slow. Even after the table was cleared it took forever to get the bill.
Go back? We will but hopefully we'll get better service next time."}
{"text":"A group of six of us came here for a birthday dinner.  We were promptly sat down soon as we walked in since the place was pretty empty.  We sat inside but they have an awesome patio with that has live music every other Saturday.

Chips and salsa are a staple at Mexican restaurants and can sent the tone of the meal.  The chips were tick and very hard with no salt on them.  The salsa was was blended and flavorful on a scale of 1-10 it was a 1 in terms of spice.  We asked for a hot salsa and the waiter brought out a green salsa that was thin as water with nothing but liquid however it was spicy. 

It was kind of weird but the food all came out at different times and a couple of plates came out 10 mins after the first group. Once every thing was out we all agreed the food was very bland and was lacking seasoning.  For $20 roughly per plate the food was very average. 

The drinks were good but you can get good drinks at a million restaurants that also have good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to frequent this restaurant A LOT before we had our baby. I used to be vegan and their veggie fajitas made it possible for me to have the best meal without any animal products in it. Everything, including their chips and salsa, are made in house. Service has always been very attentive and accurate. If you have a chance, sit at the bar and Carlos will take great care of you. He is friendly, remembers what you order, talks with you but doesn't overstay. We have not been there in a little while because we live so far from it but we will definitely return and I can't wait."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant in downtown Chandler.  It's not a typical \"Mexican\" place.  Sure it has the usual stuff (burros, etc).  But you can also get chicken mole!!  The service is good, the food is good, and the menu has some different items on it.

And when the weather is nice they have a patio.

I should really come here more often."}
{"text":"First time visit and met some friends for dinner.  The place wasn't packed and our friends beat us there.  They had drinks and just  had some appetizer chip/dip dropped.  We sat for 25 minutes before a waiter asked us for our drink orders or to check on our friends.  He showed just in time because we were just voting on walking out an going somewhere else.  Again, the place wasn't overly busy, no excuse for delays.  We went ahead and ordered food at the same time as drinks since we had plenty of time to look at the menu.  Food came out in a fairly reasonable time after our order was placed.  It was very good, but not exactly worth the wait or poor service.  We had to flag down our guy for a refill on drinks and my wife never got her water, I gave her mine.  Needless to say we didn't order dessert.  I can excuse slow service on a full busy night especially if the food is outstanding.  Unfortunately, not the case for this place.  I probably will not be back since.  There are better Mexican experiences closer to home and better choices in the downtown Chandler area."}
{"text":"What a fun place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo with the family.  Chips and salsa to start and then came the Margaita.  I really needed that one.  I enjoyed my chili rellenos and the rest of the family seemed to polish off their plates.  Of course some shared which was a good idea because there is a lot of tasty morsels on each plate.  

What would Cinco de Mayo be without music? No need to worry as  El Zocalo had live music  which was great.  A few of us brave ones or maybe drunk ones got up a buggied.  I would  say this was a fun place to enjouy the company, food, drinks and music on this very special evening."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!!!  Carlos pours a really nice clean margarita.  Or sip on a yummy tequila of one of the bartenders' recommendations.  The chips are served warmed, and the food certainly has a more chic twist on your standard Mexican plate.  The patio is cute, and the bar set-up puts you in the vacation mood."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten her and I am not impressed.  I decided to give it another try thinking it was possibly an off day, or maybe there was a new chef in the kitchen the first time I went.

No, sadly I had the same results.  The chips were good and seemed to be made from hand made tortillas (they were nice and thick with a good crunch).  And the re-fried beans were good.  The rest was very disappointing.  I ordered two shredded beef tacos and at first glance, they looked alright.  But what I bit into was not good at all.  The meat was so mushy, it was like what I could only think of as moist dog food out of a can.

The other plate had a taco and enchilada.  I did not try the enchilada, but was told it was not good either (coming from someone who loves and eats enchiladas all the time).

I know a lot of people love this place, but there is much better Mexican food to be had all over the Valley."}
{"text":"The food is average and the margarita I got was pretty good.  BUT...  $13 for a margarita at lunch time?  Come on people!  My lunch bill was $49 for a taco and a cheese enchilada plus two margaritas.  The service was not stellar and a 20% gratuity was added automatically because we had a table of 8.

 I have so many choices of Mexican restaurants in Chandler. I will not return here."}
{"text":"The food is OK but not anything to get excited about. I've tried it a few times over the past several years hoping it would impress me, it never does. There are other places I'd rather go that have more creative dishes, and more flavor. I'll eat there if others want to go but I don't go there otherwise."}
{"text":"I ordered a green chili \"killer\" chimichanga and ceviche togo today for dinner. I was not pleased at all! First of all, when you serve ceviche, you serve it with tortilla chips. I ended up with good ole crackers. Really? Where in Mexico or any other latin related food do you serve a 13 dollar appetizer with crackers? It's an insult to Latin Cuisine and it's an insult to me. Also, when I buy a 16 chimichanga, I expect the best chimi you couldever get. For that price I can easily buy a 14 oz Ribeye so it better be good. Umm no. It compared to something from Filibertos. Not that I don't like Filbertos, I shouldn;t have to pay double the price for the same taste. Never going here again.

{"text":"This review is for the nightlife, not the food. 

Myself and two other Latinas came here on a Friday night. There was an AWESOME band playing everything from oldies to cumbias. Even though it was ridiculously packed we were always able to find a place to rest our feet while we waited out the slow songs. Man, I haven't heard a live band play cumbias this well in a while. I seriously danced all night long. 

The bar was packed and it made it hard to get a drink, I wish they would have had servers. 

The crowd was puro Latinos. No one bothered us, no one even asked us to dance, which pissed off one of my friends but I didn't care, that's what I love about cumbias, you can dance by yourself. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I didn't really eat at this place, but it's a must return.  I love their ambience...Got the western rustic mexican restaurant feel with a huge back patio covered with trees and x-mas lights.  Might I recommend sitting out there.  I enjoyed just hangin there.  Dude that can play and sing Nora Jones - kudos bro!  They have live music I gathered on Friday nights.  The main band played one Fleetwood Mac and one Maroon 5 -- yes that's it....wha! Yeah, I know just a tease and the rest were in Spanish.  Regardless nice hangout spot if you happen to be around downtown Chandler area :)"}
{"text":"Great mole and fast service. Bomb strawberry margaritas. Would visit again. Goooo México!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 people.  We tried to make reservations, but they don't take reservations.  We got there at 7pm, all 16 of us and they told us it was a 45 minute wait.  We went to the bar next door and returned in 45 minutes.  They then told us they were just waiting on a few people to leave a table and our table would be ready.  These two ladies didn't realize they were holding up a table for 16 people, so we politely asked them to move to the bar so we could be seated.  It has now been an hour and a half and they had just bused the table and we sat down.  They brought us chips and we started eating because we were starving.  The manager then came up to us and told us we had to LEAVE the table because there was another party of 16 ahead of us.  We were all in shock.  We knew there had to be a mistake.  One of the girls spoke to the hostess and manager, asking where this other \"party\" was.  They didn't seem to have any idea so the manager said he would go ahead and \"accommodate\" for us and let us keep the table...  So we make our drink and food orders.  They messed up my drink and my salad literally had no dressing on it, but I was so hungry I just ate the leafs.  The food was OK, nothing special.  Then the check...wow this was a nightmare.  We had 16 people and they wouldn't split the check.  We were trying to figure out who owed what and we all only had cash.  We divided the check our selfs and hand wrote how much each of us gave (for our change).  The waitress was gone for 20 minutes then came back and handed back ALL our cash and said she will split the checks after all (I guess she couldn't figure out the math...)  45 minutes later we finally all got separate checks and she was sure to add her included 20% gratuity.  

Suggestions:

Take reservations for big parties and split checks.  Would have made the experience ALOT better."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Mexican food.  Pretty awful service.  We had to beg to have our order taken, get refills and finally for our check.  If you have 2 hours for lunch this is a good option.

I had the pollo adoba and it was pretty good.  Prices are a little higher than I am used to for Mexican food.  The others in our group liked the food as well."}
{"text":"Everything I've had so far has been delicious, I especially love the smothered burritos. The back patio has a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was a very bad experience for my kids and I to go to ; first of all , the service wasn't great, the food was terrible and I thought it was very overpriced. I ordered fajitas and they tasted very much like a \"chemical taste\" . Not impressed and I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Not impressed with management.  Sat in patio  and only ones in patio with a  party of 4. enjoying our drinks when the manager  approaches  us and said we had to leave when more guests showed up if we were not going to order food.  We had just sat down 15 min. prior to that and we were planing on ordering food . This  manager  did not offer us a menu or ask us if we were there just for drinks.  we had to  go approach a  snobby  hostess to receive  a menu.  What a way to run a business, With all the restaurants in valley  manager needs to go to customer service training. Was impressed with the waiters they were top notch and on top of things. Manager could learn a thing or two from his employees."}
{"text":"I'm giving a high score for mole!  It's really good and best I've tasted outside of the plaza cafe in New Mexico.  I like the quaint atmosphere and I never go in the evening. I like more quiet dining."}
{"text":"I just love Downtown Chandler! I love how it is drawing new businesses and galleries, each unique but in keeping with the classy, casual, artsy feel that is Downtown. 

El Zocalo is no exception. The restaurant is sophisticated without being pretentious. The service is friendly and owners Pam and Abed are always very approachable. Oh-- and the patio is to DIE for! The only downsides are, the prices are higher than your would usually find at other places for similar food. But sometimes it's worth paying a premium for location."}
{"text":"We love this place. Sure it's a little pricey but the food is solid and drinks are great and the outdoor patio is one of the best around. 

Most of the reviews are service related and yet we've never had bad service here. Set your expectations and enjoy.  Too many people posting ticky-tack issues here in my opinion. 

We always enjoy the shrimp rellano or shrimp fajitas and we love the unique chips. 

Can't go wrong with the OG Margarita."}
{"text":"Food good. There are not many good Mexican restaurants in the valley, but this one is good, not knock your socks off but good. Food probably a tad bit overpriced, and beans tend to be lukewarm almost every time. Salsa is great and chips are hot and very good as well, however they now charge for refill of chips which is wrong. Margaritas used to be the best in town, but over the years they are weak in tequila. I honestly think the large $10.95 Cadillac margarita needs to have the proportionate amount of alcohol to match the large glass size. If you order a double shot if tequila you will get exactly the taste of the margaritas when they first opened. Beef as in tacos are seasoned well, shredded generally in the proper way, and only occasionally do you get a hunk of fat the cook was too lazy to cut off. The borracho beans are tasty whole beans w hint of bacon, which you won't see but will detect. Oh the cheese enchiladas usually need to be warmer so the cheese is gooey. The most beautiful feature is their patio."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday night with a group of eight.  Arrived about 630 in the restaurant was not that busy.  Waiter was pleasant and came over and took our drink order.  Beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol.  You could not taste anything but the sour mix.  We let that go and ordered food.  The food came five minutes after we ordered it.  First the rice was good but the refried beers were not even warm.  Not really that great of flavor either. The meat in the Carne Asada burrito was very tender and flavorful.  It should have been for $18.  Very good and tasty.  The shredded beef taco meat was also very good.  Thirteen dollars for those.  Chips and salsa was very good..  The ambiance in the restaurant is good but when the music starts it does get a little loud and difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Great mex dish and drink. Wow, the margarita was so sneaky it hit me hours later. 

Food was really awesome. Made right and fresh. 

Service was fast and attentive. With backyard seating this place is perfect place to chill after long day over nice meal and drinks."}
{"text":"So, we have been spoiled with Mexican food in AZ especially with Spotted Donkey in Cave Creek.  El Zocalo is a close second though.  The food is good, the wait staff is always helpful, the outdoor seating is super neat, and the range of beer, tequila, and wine is amazing.  There really is something here for everyone and my wife loved their fajita (her favorite Mexican food that she tries everywhere) so if they can please her, they can please you.  The only reason for not getting five stars is when we ate there last night (my fourth time) the waiter added enchilada sauce to my chimichanga and there was an extra charge for it that he didn't mention.  Now, if this were a five star place, it wouldn't bother me because spending an extra $3 when you're spending a couple hundred isn't a big deal.  This isn't that place though.  Go to El Zocalo, you'll like it then head over to San Tan for a few beers after dinner OR to Wimpys for a malt."}
{"text":"The patio was beautiful, but that's really the only good thing I can say about this place.  Service was painfully slow.  Chips were greasy, salsa was bland....no flavor, no heat.  The guac was completly tasteless.  I had to salt it just so I could taste it.  The margaritas were just ok.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch and our bill was $68!  I really wanted to like this place, but we will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Food was just like any other Mexican food but cost more. I've been to several restaurants and by far the worst service I've ever had! The server was not at all friendly and at the start before ordering we asked if we could split the bill and was told yes. Aside from refills on drinks we didn't see our server the entire time. When we did get the bill it was in one large bill. Then when he did split it her literally split the bill and when asked what he did his response was\"I did exactly what you asked me to do.\" And handed the incorrect bill back. If there was a way to not have to pay the automatic gratuity we would have. The manager did nothing to apologize for his servers terrible service either. We will not be going back and will not recommend this place to anyone we know."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! The carne Asada dinner is the best I've had. Make sure you check out the patio in back too, totally worth the wait, especially when they have live music."}
{"text":"First time we ate at this place and it was pretty good. Service was good, pretty cool decor. The noise level was pretty loud for being such a small place but it is an open atmosphere. Drinks were pricey but I guess expected. Food was really good. I would go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group late on a Thursday night a few minutes before they closed. We didn't realize it and we we're about to turn around and leave, but the staff actually convinced us it wasn't an inconvenience. They sat us in the back patio which has a really relaxing vibe to it. We received great food and service. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We got there at 6 We wanted to sit out side they said they didnt have a table out there for 15 ppl. When I went to the rest room there was one long empty table in in the back. 
The chips and salsa only came with one kind of salsa which was too spicy for me. They didn't take our order until 7:04 we got our food at 7:40. They brought everyone their food besides me. Then they brought me tacos and I ordered a salad. 4 min later I got my salad.  Oh and I never once got a refill on my water."}
{"text":"First time, stopped in for Lunch.

Cute place, Beautiful patio, I sat inside though because it was very windy.

Awesome, hot chips and fresh salsa, very good!

I ordered the Pescado Pescado(see pics) I guess i had overlooked that the fish was fried in a corona beer batter ...........Very Overpowering flavor, I don't like beer at all, so that pretty much ruined the tacos for me. The beans and rice were delicious, though Certainly not worth $14

My Husband got the Cheese Enchiladas(see pics) They were also delicious, the sauce was just right. He said the food could have been hotter temperature wise.

Overall a nice place for ambiance especially on the patio, the food was good except for the beer batter, if you like beer though it might have worked for you, and I think their prices are a bit greedy.

{"text":"Went to Zoc's last night and enjoyed a beautiful night on the patio listening to the awesome Freddie Duran and eating dinner.  By the time we left live Salsa music had started playing inside and they were preparing to make their famous street tacos out on the patio.  The energy and atmosphere reminded me why I love AZ!"}
{"text":"The food was so-so ...the noise level indoors was out of control ...and the live music was abrasive at best. This place is in such a great location and has awesome potential. Unfortunately, our experience was much less than what we expected :("}
{"text":"I've been to El Zocalo quite a few times and the only downsides are the prices are a little steep and the sangria is very disappointing (bottled).  But the patio is famous for being awesome, the margaritas are delicious, I think their speciatly (I like the pama marg).  

You've got to try the shrimp appetizer with the chipotle sauce, get a whole order or you'll be sorry you didn't.  The soup that's on the menu is really good, I forget what it's called but it's perfect for lunch especially if you don't want to take a nap on your desk afterward.  It's got potatoes and chicken, maybe some cilantro, it's yummy and light.

Also, Friday and Saturday nights they have live music and I believe they are open pretty late, midnight or one maybe?"}
{"text":"I have had two surprises recently, how AWESOME El Zocalo's is and how low some people have reviewed this restaurant, but everyone has their own experiences.  

My GF and I went based off of a recommendation from a friend.    The place was packed due to rain and not being able to sit anyone outside.  The host told my GF and I 45 min and we waited about 20-25 min.  We were seated at a small table, but had no issues switching to one more spacious.  

Now, for the food, first the chips and salsa were really good, kind of addicting.  We ordered a margarita which was pretty tasty, and definitely had an adequate amount of alcohol.  I ordered the ahi tuna tacos and my gf ordered chicken hard tacos.  We both thought the food was great, especially the beans and rice.  For both my GF and I, growing up in Mexican families we are both pretty picky about the quality of the beans and rice and have judged mexican restaurants on them alone.  I would go back just to eat the beans and rice by themselves.  

Lastly, our waiter, Chris, was on point.  Very attentive and good attitude.  The place is a little pricey, but you get your money's worth in the food."}
{"text":"I have been to El Zocalo multiple times and alway experience very poor service. The last time I went we had a 30 minute wait, which is fine. After I saw 2 other couples get seated that arrived after us I inquired with the hostess. Her manager was standing there also and said he would seat us immediately. 10 minutes later I walked out of the restaurant and I won't be back!

The other times that i have eaten there, the food is so-so and overpriced.

There are definitely better Mexican food restaurants in Chandler. If you just want the downtown Chandler experience, I recommend one of the other restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple friday nights ago. I kept getting fed some hardcore marg's and when it got late they had street taco's on the patio!!! The tables cleared out around 10:30 and the dancin began. It was a fun time."}
{"text":"Looking for fabulous Mexican food? Look no further if you're dining in downtown Chandler.

The chili verde is exceptional and the cheese relleno topped with chili verde is exquisite! If it sounds like I love chili verde, it's because I do.

Our waiter, Nick, was very helpful and made good suggestions. His service overall was very good.

The atmosphere is very nice and there's outside dining when the weather permits."}
{"text":"Always great service and awesome food! Love the patio! Margaritas are great. You can't go wrong. The General Manager always engages and takes great care of us! We will be back of course!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat at this place so cannot really say anything about the food, BUT I can tell you that the bartender new how to make a super yummy Michelada. I asked for a bloody beer and he knew what I wanted...He said \"like a Michelada\". It was good and tasty I didn't want the beer to end. The rim had tamarind/Lucas flavor around the rim which just hit the spot. Music was mainly salsa at night?  But would a few other types here and there. Cannot speak much about the service and I didn't have a server, just went up to bar grabbed a drink and went onto patio!"}
{"text":"A superb choice for those who love Mexican food as well as for those who don't.

Six of us went to El Zocalo on a Sunday based upon Yelp reviews, and we were pleased overall.  Arriving a little before 1pm, we were seated shortly on the patio (as requested).  The table was mostly in the Sun, and we requested having an umbrella moved to shade us.  It took a while, but eventually a \"bus boy\" complied, and all was well.  The chips and salsa arrived quickly; the drink orders not as fast.  The chips were thick, crunchy, and excellent.  The salsa was tasty but mild.  We ordered a side of guacamole which was long in arriving and rather tame.  We mixed it with the salsa which improved it greatly.   

Our entrees included three varieties of fajitas: chicken, beef, and shrimp.  All three were excellent.  Though they were not spicy, this met the desire of the three who ordered them.  Meanwhile, my wife ordered the \"#2\" verde burrito which was quite spicy and pleased her greatly.  (Hot Mexican food is her favorite.)  Her sister ordered a \"Killer Chimichanga\" which was large and very good.  Based upon a Yelp review, I tried the Carne Asado, and was extremely pleased.  It was a flank steak (like the meat of the chimichanga) and was grilled \"medium\" as requested which is tough to do on a thin steak.  My Asado arrived with a side of guacamole and pico de gallo which I mixed together to create a tasty (but still rather tame) topping.  Two of us also had the \"borrachos\", a bean side dish made with bacon and onions.  It was an alternative to having a side of black beans or refried beans, neither of which excite me, and the borrachos were excellent!  

Though the service was \"sketchy\", the food and patio ambience were very, very nice.  In the future, because of getting broiled by the Sun, I would advise an evening meal around sunset or later.  (There are many propane heating towers throughout the patio to keep everyone \"toasty\".)  I would also expect the service to be slow and arrive at 6pm expecting to get dinner served by 7pm.  (Basically, add an hour to your seating time.) Dinner for 6 was under $200 including drinks, tip, & taxes."}
{"text":"Update after recent visit: while I still find the food very good I have to downgrade my previous rating due to price increases and poor service. 

Recently I noticed that beginning with your second bowl of chips you are charged. I asked the waiter about this and he said it was because they found that they were wasting too many chips. To me these are throw-away items at a Mexican restaurant anyway. 

It also appears that their dinner pricing has gone up with the food quantities staying abou the same. One comment in my group was \"this is Chandler, not Scottsdale! Why are the prices so high, especially for Mexican food?\"

I have also been experiencing mediocre service. Recently we were in after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd and really got poor attention / service. Particularly since the place was relatively empty.

Shape up El Zocalo or you'll find yourself a victim of this recession. That would be a shame because Chandler could really use a more upscale Mexican restaurant with REASONABLE pricing.

===========

I don't know why but Chandler is really hurting for great Mexican food. Considering that, this place rocks. My favorite is the Chicken Mole. You cannot find that on most menus period and this is definitely authentic. I also judge a Mexican restaurant on their rice. Most rice is horrible, this place has very authentic rice (I use my grandma and aunt's cooking as baselines). 

Next is as mentioned, the ambiance. Great place, particularly when the weather permits you to dine outdoors.

As noted, this is not a cheap Mexican joint. You would think you could find great Mexican food at cheap prices but you'll have to go to El Rancho or the  Food City restaurant (name escapes me) for that."}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere. The patio is very nice and the food is very authentic. We scheduled a company lunch there and we were able to outside. Private and enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is maybe mediocre. The food isn't that great especially for the price. 13.00 for two tiny cheese enchiladas. The service was HORRIBLE the guy was too busy talking to his friends and we had to flag down 2 different servers for a refill. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out on a Friday night.  Live music and a great patio with heaters and a fire pit.  Food is very good.

We always have a good time when we go here."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed dinner here. Service was excellent and the food was really good. We had fajitas and it was a lot of food and we took a whole a lot of food. Beans and rice were excellent. Love the ambience in the back patio is terrific. Fun area"}
{"text":"I personally love this place.  Their patio is really awesome.  Funky decor.  Their margaritas are yummy and strong!  I ordered their mole and it was very, very good.  Some of the best I've had.  Cute little location in 'downtown' Chandler.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great couples Mexican restaurant. The margaritas are worth the trip. You can tell that service is a priority. No matter who waits our table they are always polite and mindful that you're content through each step of the meal. Never had a good dessert here. The sopapia's and the flan are pretty weak. So we go for the great food, the service and the tasty margaritas. Pass on the dessert."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went yesterday when they opened and sat out on their nice patio. I ordered the cheese relleno and I was very satisfied - one of the better chile rellenos I have had in a long time...lots of cheese and it was large! Refried beans were fine. And the meal came with flour tortillas, which I did not expect. We also ordered guacamole, which was also very good; however, they put tomatoes in their guacamole and I prefer it simply to be avocado and seasonings - I think it is just to add bulk reducing the amount of actual guacamole when any restaurant does that.The server was nice and she also brought me a hotter salsa, since the typical one was not hot enough for me (still good, though). It was good we could sit out on the patio because my friend said the inside smelled like cleaner (which makes sense since they were just opening); and I thought it was stuffy inside. When we walked out back through the restaurant we noticed the music was kindof loud and not appealing in the slightest. Bottom line...sit outdoors and enjoy some very good Mexican food. We didn't have alcoholic beverages, but they had an extensive list of margaritas (no prices for these drinks, so ask.)"}
{"text":"When I asked folks at my hotel for a recommendation for Mexican food, I should've been more specific and asked where Mexican people go for Mexican food. Instead, I was sent to El Zocalo, which was pretty to look at, but lacking in substance.  Hmm, kinda reminds me of home.  The food was downright bad.  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas, and the chicken was dry and way overcooked. The spices were bland.  I actually had better fajitas at Baja Fresh for half the price.  The only saving grace was the black beans.  

I had the chicken tostada salad.  The salad tasted like it came from a Fresh Express salad mix.  It was a blend of romaine and iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage.  The shredded chicken was ok, and there was a generous amount of avocados and sliced jalapenos (not fresh), but the flavors did not go well together.  

Portions are big, but the food was so disappointing that we didn't bother taking the leftovers to go. Service was slow, and the restaurant didn't seem too busy.  Our waiter never refilled my water glass, which was empty throughout the whole meal.  I think he felt bad about that because he gave me water in a to-go cup with the check.  That's a first.  

Go for the music and the atmosphere, but save your money and eat elsewhere.  The food is expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of variety and I love the ambience. I look forward to going there once the weather cools down and enjoying their patio!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the exceptional outside patio here several times. The food is average but I love the patio. I decided to call and make a reservation for our company Christmas party in mid December, I was told by Anthony the gentleman that answered the phone , that \"they don't take reservations\". I was a bit stunned, I was bringing 14 people for drinks and food but they told me it would be first come first served. Not really the way to plan a holiday party with invited guests, not for me anyway. I questioned the policy but to no avail. I eat out frequently all across the country one of my personal criteria for an exceptional restaurant is one that takes the needed steps to accomodate the customer. Such is not the case here. Just a side note last years Christmas party with the same head count was a $2,200.00 tab."}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate - when paying with this I was told NO CREDIT on gift cert allowed. They just get to keep the balance. 
No cash back or use towards tip. I get that.  But won't leave the balance for another visit???? 
UNACCEPTABLE in my world!!! 
There was no other customer in the place to give it to. 
Did get food to go, no chips, salsa, napkins or utensils. One would think with the money they keep from gift cert they could afford these EXTRAS!
NOT IMPRESSED with management practices ."}
{"text":"Love Zoc's!!  One of the first restaurants we ever went to after moving to AZ and it continues to be a favorite - Beautiful patio, great place for a group or a romatic dinner.  Food is tasty and very authentic.  Great place to take out of town guests"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me (it is very fresh though). The food is okay at best. I probably won't go there again due to the service."}
{"text":"Finally ate here yesterday. It was really good. We have avoided it in the past since it is usually so crowded. They have a MASSIVE (and gorgeous) patio in the back that you would never know existed. Service was great and the food was really good as well. We tried the chicken chili relleno and a cheese relleno and got the quesadilla for the kid. Good flavors and sauces. And the spouse says the margarita was quite yummy too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here last Sunday for lunch and were incredibly pleased! The food in this restaurant is authentic and of high quality. You can really taste the fresh ingredients that they use as it brings the quality of their food to another level. I asked the server for recommendation and she told me that chicken cheese relleno and it was absolutely fantastic! Their pricing is a little bit higher than most restaurants Mexican out there; however, he really get what you pay for as you can tell as aforementioned that they use fresh ingredients.

They have a ton of tequilas for specialty margaritas as well. 

Now what really made it this Sunday morning/afternoon even that more enjoyable where the mariachis who were playing on their absolutely beautiful patio. These mariachis weren't the run of the mill musicians they were really talented. They created such a nice atmosphere for my wife, my mom and my daughter that we plan on going back again frequently. Here is a video of the mariachis on the patio: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaco5JB-yJI"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my husband. We have lived in chandler for 8 years and this was our 1st visit. We did not sit out on the patio due to the weather. The inside was kinda small and I really disliked that there were no booths. The bar was very open to the dining area which made it very loud. The tables were all covered in white table cloths but the chairs were like cheap outdoor patio chairs, These chairs were not comfortable at all. 
I ordered the burrito enchilada style with shredded beef. My husband ordered a combo with a taco and burro. In my opinion the food was only ok. And for the price I hoped it would have been better. They uncharged me $2 for the enchilada style. $1 for a very small side of sour cream.  Chips and Salsa were pretty good. Service was very slow. Overall this didn't live up to my expectations. However I would consider going again to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. My wife had the Shrimp Relleno and I had the Chili Verde and Tortilla Soup. We both agreed that the food was fantastic and had great flavor.

The service was extremely terrible. We waited 20 minutes to have our order taken and then our soup came out the same time as our entrees. There was so much wrong with our server that it'd take too much time to write it all down. The other servers appeared to handle their tables exceptionally.

Pam, the owner, came out and saved the experience. She apologized profusely, understood our complaints, and took care of our meal. She definitely saved this from being a 2-star experience to a 4-star experience. We'll definitely come back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night with my girlfriend and the ladies, and I was an extremely happy man. I wasn't expecting much- Mexican food in my area is pretty whitewashed, but this was actually the real deal. It's fancier than your average taco stand, and their fare is a bit more upscale than street food, but the fact that they actually pay attention to what they're doing REALLY shows.

For an appetizer we got fried shrimp, and they were incredible! Butterflied, battered, and fried just perfectly. I ordered the chicken mole, my girlfriend got the steak and shrimp, and the ladies split some enchiladas. Everything was excellent, and extremely comparable to good upscale dining in Mexico. 

(I should note- my girl made some enchiladas today and they blew Zocalo's out the water, but sometimes you just want to let someone else do the work...)

The service was great- our drinks never ran out, and everyone was extremely friendly. The outside seating area was perfect, but even the indoor dining looked really nice. All in all I can say that I'm impressed, and that takes a LOT for me when it comes to Mexican food. We'll definitely be back... oh, believe dat!!!"}
{"text":"I want to thank Pam & Jason for being able to handle and correct the situation. They have been nothing but amazing in serving us and I am extremely thankful for it. I highly recommend coming to this place. Their food, drinks and service has been nothing but AMAZING. I have nothing but nice things to say and appreciate the situation being corrected. This family owned business knows costumer service and will continue to come here and enjoy the food and environment."}
{"text":"Was going to go to San Tan and then we were like \"let's try this place\"! We sat down and we looked at the menus and we were shocked at how expensive it was for Mexican food. The chips and salsa were really good. The food itself was on the spicy side for my husband. We will probably never go back because we spent $40 on 2 entrées that were Mexican food and not amazing."}
{"text":"The coolest patio environment plus the best chili releno EVER!"}
{"text":"We had gone to this Resturant about 3 years ago and really enjoyed the food,so with good memories we went back last night to celebrate our birthdays!  Big mistake!! I ordered ahi tuna tacos... Nearly NO tuna... Paying $17 for the ahi tuna with only about 4 tiny pieces of tuna! I told the manager, voiced my complaint, he took care of this situation with a salsa sized bowl of ahi tuna.... Perfect!! Made me happy!  However.... He told us that the tuna is pre measured for each taco, he just found out that this Resturant (compared to their other Resturant) is taking 1 pre measured amt of ahi and dividing it for both tacos (giving each taco 1/2 a serving of the ahi, yet still charging $17!!). The manager wasn't happy with this discovery and will bring to his bosses' attention!  Plus my corn tortillas were far from fresh!!  My daughters ordered a  chicken dish... But got shrimp & charged for shrimp, when brought to the servers  attention he corrected the price difference (of $3)  The server wasn't aware of any of our needs...drink refills, extra napkins, never asked if we wanted more chips & salsa.... he pretty much vanished and the place was empty, only 1 other table, so he couldn't have been too busy.  My husbands order was ok, he ordered a burro and there was a lot of tortilla and not enough filling!"}
{"text":"Saturday night....We had a party of about 9 and we were seated very quickly. Love the thick tortilla chips. Waiter was very nice and split the checks for us without even being asked. Food was good... Nothing mind blowing but was average... Good. The bathroom needs remodeled and is very creepy and outside??"}
{"text":"For a restaurant in old town Chandler, this place was nothing like I imagined. Modern and vibrant from the food to the art and its' patrons. I was very impressed. The food was reasonably priced and the margaritas were strong. I knocked out soon after dinner.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The band in the patio was entertaining, I didn't know Rob Thomas/Matchbox20 songs were such a hit in this town. Overall it was a great night."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service ruined the experience. My boyfriend and I were out on a date. We ordered food at the bar and the guy never put the order in. So he says he will take off or drinks. When we get the food. It wasn't even what we ordered. Then we got the bill and he never took off the drinks like he said. We paid for it anyways. We aren't the type to fight over that. It just made us decide we will probably never go back. One bad visit is enough for us."}
{"text":"I love this place, best chicken mole ever! Great patio."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for my brother's birthday. No one on the staff recognized the special occasion. The waiter that had our table looked pissed off the whole time he had us and was downright rude when we asked him to spit the check. Considering the restaurant was completely empty on a Sunday evening, so it's not like he had any other tables to attend to. Not to mention we had no choice but to pay a 20% auto gratuity because of our party size. A 20% tip for horrible service! Are you kidding me?!? When we asked for a manager to complain, he shrugged it off and was like oh well. Trust me go to Macayos or Garcia's instead. You'll get much better service, the same quality (if not better) food, and pay $4-5 a plate less."}
{"text":"Service was slow. The waiter disappeared for almost 20 minutes. Had to stop another waiter to ask for water and silverware. Then to top it all off I got food poisoning. Never again"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see El Zocalo only has a weighted average of 3 stars. My family and I had a most pleasant experience.

The venue does a wonderful job of creating a Rocky Point-esque kind of feel. 

When we walked in we were greeted immediateily, seated promptly, and tended to by our server Kyle right away.

The tortilla/dipping chips were fresh & thick, and the salsa was fresh also.

Negative: the space is set up in a way that it is easy to hear other people's conversations

We went on a Wednesday about 1 pm and it was moderately filled with patrons.

I ordered the taco/enchilada combo and enjoyed it, wasn't mind blowing, but certainly above average. My wife has a raspberry walnut salad (yummy dressing!). 

At one point my baby dropped his bottle and another server came over to pick it up,and he also picked up our check when he saw our payment was ready The venue feels has a very family/small restaurant owned kind of feel.

I would certainly recommend El Zocalo without hesitation."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Make sure you sit outside in the beautiful courtyard.  The food was excellent and the service as well.  We lingered after dinner and listened to some amazing live music.  Such a perfect ambiance with the blooming bougainvillea and twinkling lights.  We never make miss this place when visiting Chandler."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!! I have been here multiple times and It never disappoints. The food is amazing and always so yummy."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre but service was awful.  Hostess apparently thinks she owns the place, waiter didn't even know what was on the menu.  Worst part was the place was dead, only 4 tables inside and half of the outside was open and they took 20 mins to seat us on a Friday night.  I should have known better.  Won't ever be going back there again."}
{"text":"Let's be fair, if you like non-spicy, non-authentic mexican, servers too young to make margaritas, or overpriced dining on metal rod chairs, all hale, for you have found the restaurant for you!

Now I will be contrite, the service was great. Our server asked two people to make our drinks. That was how I knew this was going to be a distaster. When my gf said I can't tell which drink has extra salt the bell rang. I couldn't taste any alcohol in my over-priced drink either.  My shrimp were skimp. Not scampi bit not butterflied. I was hard pressed to pay full price for three tortillas on my fajitas. Then charged more for tortillas when I asked! How deceiving. Why make fajitas that need more tortillas than comes with? Was I supposed to be Frank Llyod Write and make all my veggies sit on three tiny torts? Not to mention the food was spiceless, no oregano, no pepper, what part of seasoning in culinary school did you miss? When I pour the salsa from the chip bowl on my food it should be a dead give away. Surprisingly that was not enough either. Worst food, terribly expensive. I will not return to your attempt of Mexican food. I'd had better at a taco bell."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible.  Worst service ever.  What's worse is the manager didn't even care when we brought it up.  Also, food sucked.  I saw someone reviewed it as El Suckalo- I agree."}
{"text":"Wow chimi that is deep fried.  Margaritas with a kick. Downtown Chandler.  Patio in the back has a great atmosphere.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ugh! Wanted to love this place, but from the get go, server \"Bethany\" was lacking. Spilled margarita on the husbands phone, never brought more napkins after half an attempt at apologizing. Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake. Apparently my sister ordered a burrito unbeknownst to her. After some confusion when food was delivered, Bethany came back out and using a snarky tone told my sister what she ordered and again half attempted to get what my sis really wanted. Instead of waiting another half hour for what she really wanted, her and my husband switched plates. Whatever we weren't going to argue. Long story short, my husband, sis and I have all previously been in service and the service here was definitely slow and lacking. Not worth the money for the experience we had. 2 stars was only given for food. Service was bad to say the least. Would hate to see what a busy night would be. We came on a Tuesday. Will not return"}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite Mexican place in Az! I moved here four years ago and wanted a good Mexican place. One of my new friends I made here in AZ took me to El Zocalo for dinner one night and I'm SO glad she did! It's delicious! Now I live walking distance from El Zocalo and can get my Mexican food fix whenever I want."}
{"text":"I really want to keep coming to this place and have it be one of our go to places but it's seriously the most EXPENSIVE Mexican Restaurant that I dine at! This time around, my BF and I took his son for dinner. So it's only the 3 of us. Typically there's 7 of us which I know can get very costly! Our meal for the 3 of us cost over $53, not including the 15-20% tip! We ordered 2 house margaritas, beef fajitas with extra beef. Side of beans and Guacamole as a starter! For how costly the Fajitas are, you'd think when you request for extra tortillas, they'd be free but that's not the case. The Fajitas are already $18 plus requesting extra meat which is now a $21 meal. We shared the fajitas. The food is good and I've always had great service and love their patio seating area; but for the price, is it really worth it?"}
{"text":"I may be one of few to give Zocalo all five stars, but in my eyes this place is everything you could ask for in a Mexican restaurant. The food is to the T, the margs are perfect and the people that work here are the sweetest. As ridiculous as it sounds, I rarely go to restaurants with less than 4 stars on Yelp...but this place is the exception. It's so underrated.

Overall, this place deserves more than 3 stars. If you give Zocalo a try you definitely will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas and great ambiance. Like the back patio or bar seating. Tortilla soup and carne asada best!"}
{"text":"Have been several times and service and food has gone down hill each time. 

Went last night for dinner to enjoy the back patio... They had a special event so patio closed.  We sat inside it was so noisy we had to either yell to talk or just not speak.  Ordered steak fajitas and there was hardly any meat in them.  My husband ordered chili rellanos and lacked flavor and very unappealing to look at. 

I was bummed and wont return for dinner... Maybe drinks but only on the back patio

Big disappointment"}
{"text":"Late night latin bar/club. Great dancing, good DJ if you like some banda and merengue.. not alot of salsa or reguetton. 
Food... meeh
Drinks.. meeh

I had a great time dancing but i wish every song wasn't just a merengue remix. Put in other latin music!"}
{"text":"El Zocalo is my birthday spot every year! I cant get enough of their margaritas and fine mexican food.  I like going there on the weekends for the live music when the dinner floor transitions over to a dance floor and the fun begins.  Its so conveniently placed and I recommend it to everyone.  I like that I can take my whole family and children as well."}
{"text":"Just like an old-western film, there's the good, the bad and the ugly about this place. The food and patio keep me coming back. Their salsa could be a meal onto itself, often filling me up before my entree arrives. Sitting on the patio on a cool evening, with the lights and live band, takes you back to what Arizona must have been like when it was Spanish territory. 

On the flip side, service is usually slow and unattentive. I've had the same waiter several times and he's always been dismissive. Reservations or not, they cannot seem to handle large parties (8 or more). They're catering, while amazing food, isn't very efficient at picking up materials. We once had a party over at 9pm and they didn't show until midnight to retrieve their buffet items."}
{"text":"The fresh chips and salsa got us off to a great start, the carne asada was grilled to perfection, and their guacamole is to die for. Their patio is one of the best in the east valley. They should work on speeding up service a little tho."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions and very bland food.  The salsa was the only thing that had any flavor.  The inside dining room is noisy and was only about 1/2 full for during our dinner time visit.  The outside patio looked like the place to be - it is beautiful - but it was a little too chilly to eat outside.  

They do have a lunch menu with entress priced at $8 compared to an average of $15 for dinner.  I would be hard pressed to recommend this place and we will not be returning - Serranos which is right across the street has better food."}
{"text":"If you can get by the \"not so dynamic\" host at the door, you will have wonderful food and wonderful ambiance on the back patio! I highly recommend their fish tacos! I haven't had any others like this--in CA nor in Mexico! 

We have always had yummy food and this restaurant beats any chain Mexican restaurant out there! It is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"What a great patio for a late afternoon lunch. Relaxing and delicious. Margaritas and lunch with music and great tree coverage. The salsa and chips were awesome!!! Prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"First time I went here and ate we thought everything was fine but it went downhill from there...the food is not consistent and Noone really acts like they care....we even tried to go food but again no consistency....then we found something unidentifiable in our food.....their response just give me back my money....how about making it right~!   I am so disscouraged because this place had so much potential~!   ;*(   not ever going back~!  ;*("}
{"text":"Seems that the entree's are about $5 more than you'd pay elsewhere, but you're paying extra for the atmosphere.  However, if you plan on eating inside, be prepared that the noise level may be quite loud, as it echoes.

You never know when you'll find yourself sitting akin to a 'girls night out' table, with several shrill voices.

Their flavorful pork verde will bring us back, but next time we'll wait for the patio."}
{"text":"Food was good but server and bartender really weren't.   Sign out front said try our Skinny no Sugar Margarita.   Bartender did squeeze the lime juice but then added a ton of Orange Liquor (tons of sugar and very sweet)  this is not a skinny Margarita,  not low carb and not sugar free.   Very  weak on the Tequila no where near worth the $13 each price tag and he sort of had an attitude when we questioned it.    Food came out wrong and even though all 4 of us heard the order our server still tried to question that we ordered it  right.   She also didn't do anything to make it right,  attitude like the bartender.   I doubt we will return.   Walk 4 doors down to DC Steakhouse,  great people,  great attitudes,  great value,  jump through hoops if anything isn't perfect.  Will never return to the worst Mexican in chandler"}
{"text":"Food poisoning - I ordered chicken enchiladas and 10 hours later vomiting and full course of illness associated.  I called the Manager Anthony who disregarded it is a bad experience.  I will call the health department since the owner has not returned my call.  This review is to advise consumers and travelers who might want to select this place - could it be health standards are not practiced, cutting back by using outdated chicken, or the temperature control is not practiced?  Either way a  Manager did not know how to handle the situation and asked me what I thought he should do.  Wow now that is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Their patio is a nice area, wait staff was nice as well. However the food was alright, not worth the slightly elevated prices and they charge for extra chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night.  I had heard about El Zocalo for a long time but never went in.  I knew they had a great patio so when we decided to try it and were told we could be seated immediately on the patio, we went for it.  It was around 6:30PM and they had fans outside blowing mist so it helped with the heat a bit.  The outdoor patio/courtyard is a great atmosphere.  As it gets dark it really looks very cool.  Freddie Duran played his guitar and sang.  He did a mixture of some Eagles, Steely Dan, Van Morrison, etc... as well as some songs in Spanish.  He took requests too.  There were some young girls who walked around offering samples of margaritas and other types of drinks.  The waiter was fine...nothing special but no complaints. We only ordered appetizers because we weren't that hungry and didn't want to spend a ton of money.  We had the stuffed quesadilla (shredded beef) and the bean dip.  Honestly the food didn't blow us away but it was fair enough and I felt the overall experience was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were really good.  I definitely plan on going back soon- not necessarily for the food but for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Great margeritas Cadillac!!!!!  Best carne asada plate!!!!  Great food everytime!  Homemade chips and salsa!!! Best Mexican food in Chandler, Az"}
{"text":"Dinner was great  tequila was amazing and the steak and enchiladas were awesome!  The staff was very attentive and papa smurf waited on us hand and foot. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Mexican food."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed this \"upscale\" Mexican place in downtown Chandler. I had a mojito at first...well mojitos in general should come in a short glass...so it was okay...kind of sweeter than usual. The chips  and salsa was very good as we kept refilling 3 times.
Now to the main course...i had the Shrimp releno.....it was cheesy and they smothered it with some chili verde sauce. I wish they would put more shrimp but still good. The place is pricey but if you do go...sit outside...it is nice."}
{"text":"I have to admit. I have never heard of this place. A friend of mine, his dad was playing there. They were busy in the Restaurant, but had a few tables on the back patio empty. So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating, but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time. 
Well by the time I told my friend's dad who was singing there, we finally got served our food. It was pretty good and a decent price. The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy, but his employees were terrible, awful. I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star."}
{"text":"Still my favorite restaurant in town! If you haven't tried it yet, you must! The food is fresh, homemade and amazingly delicious. I recommend sitting on the patio in the back, it's so charming and delightful."}
{"text":"Worst Service I ever had! Our party waited over an hour and a half for food to arrive, we waited 20-30 minutes for chips & salsa and even for them to bring us drinks!! When we complained about the long wait the manager and owner did not want to hear it! It was obvious they don't want to improve their restaurant by listening to customer suggestions. They were rude and flat out did not care to insult US paying customers for letting them know their food took too long!! We will never go back, good Mexican food can easily be found anywhere and this place was pricey and the food was mediocre,  so you won't be missing anything by skipping this place and going somewhere else were customers are valued!"}
{"text":"This restaurant by far has the worst service I have ever experienced!! I will NEVER go back!! Not only do they have bad service, but their manager and owner failed to even see the problem that an hour and a half wait time to receive our food was. The manager and owner were very rude, disrespectful, condescending, and unprofessional. They proceeded to tell our party that they accommodated us in seating our party of 12 because we took up table space in their patio. Not only this, but after hearing our complaints of our service the manager said that we had great service that our food only took 45 mins to get to our table. Basically calling all 12 of us liars. I cannot give this place a bad enough review. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially if you are visiting Chandler. If you go despite this review with a group larger than 8, make sure that you all take cash. They have a restaurant policy that they will NOT divide up the check, and you can only pay with one credit card or with cash. Apparently this policy is written in fine print on their menu. Therefore, the server did not disclose this information to our party. When it came time to pay we all had credit cards. It took us over 2 hours to speak with management and the owner about these issues. Nothing was resolved. In the end the server separated our bill and the manager and owner acted as though they did us a favor. Again I CANNOT give this restaurant a low enough rating! 

El Zocalo is El Suckalo!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for small, medium, and large group gatherings. Decent Mexican dishes at fair prices in downtown Chandler. Everyone in our group seemed to Enjoy their dinner. Killer chimichangas, fajitas, enchiladas. Chips and salsa was very good and replenished often. 

They offer ample outdoor seating and a great atmosphere. At the end of the day, it's just Mexican food. For me, it only gets so good."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, excellent food!  EXCELLENT, our service,  waiter, and manager were all wonderful.  The only negative was the noxious Windex smell from them cleaning tables."}
{"text":"Okay.  Can really sink the place but nothing really great.  You would think it would be much better since it is in the south west.  The Michelada was a crime against all Lari people.   The back patio was cosy though."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. The food is excellent, the salsa is good, and I like the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I first ate at El Zocalo in March 2013 while on a business trip and had the BEST chili relleno that I have ever had.  So much so when I was back in Phoenix in Sept 2014 I made a point of driving 20 minutes to have dinner here again.  The restaurant has a nice flow and feel to it.  Chili Relleno was just as good as I remembered.  Will come back the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group on a Friday for happy hour.  Our waitress was awful.  It took forever to get a drink, and I was only the third person to arrive and the place was still empty!

The food was okay, but I wish there was smaller options, especially for a happy hour.  The drinks too were just okay.

The real problem was with our bill.  For about 12 of us, it came out to be $800.00.  My friend and her mom split a meal.  When they brought it out on two plates, both of them started eating them.  After they were halfway done, the waitress informs them that one of those plates was actually for someone else.  Ok, fine, but that's not my friend's fault.  They should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them!  She asked the waitress to take it off the bill, and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manager.  What?!  Then the manager told her that since she ate it, she should have to pay for it.  I have never heard someone act so rudely as a manager!  He should have easily taken the $15 off from our $800 bill!  I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, service was great drinks were good, but the food was SO SO.. Prices were very reasonable, atmosphere is nice. These folks are new to the happy hour game perhaps they will catch up! We are rooting for them because they have a great patio and wonderful owners."}
{"text":"Returned with our family & found the food to be horrible and over priced. The men's bathroom was filthy and the 2 toilets in the ladies room wouldn't flush. We definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Server was soooooo slow but food was good and they have latin music on the patio after 10 or so"}
{"text":"We came across this little gem and it didn't disappoint. The mole was fantastic. The drinks were generously poured and our server, John, was quite a character and added to the experience. Definitely sit out on the back patio if you have the chance."}
{"text":"I don't know what all you haters are talking about but our service was awesome! There was no wait to be seated on a Saturday night around 6. The weather was perfect for patio dining and their patio was surprisingly well decorated. We loved the atmosphere. The food had great flavor, not the best Mexican food I've had but I'm very particular. I gave it 5 stars because we were so pleasantly surprised with our experience after reading all the terrible reviews. So either all you negative people had a bad night or El Zocalo had a customer service over-haul. Either way give them a try. They deserve a chance to earn your business. After all, you'll be supporting a local business and not at a national chain cookie cutter restaurant."}
{"text":"Carlos quiere margarita ahora. The food was good but the service was slow. turtle slow. when I go to a restaurant it took 40 minutes before I got my margarita."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa around! Amazing carne asada nachos add roasted jalapeño! Service is always top notch! Great place for sitting on back patio so beautiful!"}
{"text":"They would not give me a free water to go!!!!!!! A water????? Shame on you smh we live in Arizona."}
{"text":"Patio is wonderful, especially for east coasters in February.  Food was good, service excellent and staff was very courteous.  Recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to El Zocalo a few times.  It is in downtown Chandler, and our fave spot is San Tan Brewery, but it is difficult to get into, and sometimes we just want a good margarita.  We are definitely fans of Tequila. 

If you have a chance, check out the patio, it is absolutely gorgeous out there when the weather is nice.  Its a nice large patio.  The night that we went we were hoping to get some good Happy Hour specials, and upon arrival (10-15min before 6) we were seated instantly, but I was kind of annoyed with the fact that it seemed to take the waiter awhile to get to us, which mankes me think they are hoping we miss  happy hour.  When we asked our waiter what was on special it was literally one drink, and an app. Kinda sucky for a Mexican place on a Friday night.  Needless to say that was disappointing. 

However, our margaritas were really good, he had a more \"authentic\" margarita, not too sweet which is what he prefers, and mine was perfect for me.  Complimentary chips with our drinks, and then we left.  I personally have never eaten  here, so I can't attest to their food, but everything I have seen looks good. 

Overall, cute atmosphere, and the margaritas are good, but can be pricey.  I hate when they don't put the price on their menu, I instantly think they are priced too high."}
{"text":"Friday evening and our foursome stopped in for dinner and drinks. The margaritas here are amazing. Sweet and liberally dosed with a salty bite. Try the house gold - couldn't be more delicious. The chips and salsa are quite good - very crispy thick tortilla chips with salsa that is just spicy enough. Every single one of our entrees were delicious. We tried four different plates - seafood tacos, smothered burritos, mole, and a torta. Yum. You can't go wrong with a visit here and the service is quick and gracious."}
{"text":"This is a great place for happy hour or late night drinking in downtown Chandler: awesome bar, live music and a fantastic patio.  I finally had the full dinner experience here last Friday and I actually thought the food was pretty good, too.  The hubby got the chicken mole which was very tasty.   My fish tacos were good but nothing special.

Their chips and salsa are really awesome.  The chips are hearty with a good flavor even on their own.  They are thick enough to stand up to the bean dip which is a must try item.  We love that they have Pacifo on tap but my husband was disappointed that they don't have Bohemia (even bottled).  The other stars on the drink menu are the margaritas in various flavors but since I don't care for tequila I can't comment on those.

On the night we ate there we experienced similar service issues as other reviewers... long wait for a table due to lack of bussing, no silverware until after our food arrived, etc.  Our server was busting her hump but they were just way understaffed.  She managed to stay cheerful and friendly so that's a plus.  To be fair it was Third Friday that night."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to us by a new friend.  The food was awesome everyone enjoyed their meal.  Seating is limited."}
{"text":"Great hidden Mexican joint.  We stopped in for a quick lunch on a Monday afternoon... We must have just missed the lunch crowd because the place wasn't busy.  We sat outside and I was a little worried it would be to warm but the outside patio had plenty of shade and was very comfortable.  Service was quick and friendly.  I got the carne asada burrito and it was some of the best carne asada I've had...the refried beans and rice that came with it were pretty good too.  The wife got the shrimp burrito enchilada style and she raved about it.  I'm definitely going back and would like to see what its like on the weekend at night"}
{"text":"Seriously the best chile relleno I've ever had. I'm ready to go back already. Good option for vegetarians. The chips and salsa are killer. Great ambiance. Highly recommend this place, especially for a Friday lunch downtown Chandler."}
