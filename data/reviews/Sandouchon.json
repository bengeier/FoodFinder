{"text":"Como la tía veneno! Amazing food... Fast service , what else??? amazing sandwichs from my country (Perú) i love that place..im gonna come back for sure..."}
{"text":"Really interesting place, better choice than the classic fast food joints in the food courts. Yuca fries w/ spicy mayo were great and I feel worth it alone. Unfortunately was not overly impressed by the duck heart sandwich. It seemed to lack spice and flavour adequate enough to really allow me to enjoy it. To be fair this may be a personal thing, but compared to the beef sandwich (which was really good) we also go it it was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Great seasoning and excellent onions! A bit of a wait for a food court restaurant but worth the wait! Not expensive either for a combo. Only tried chicken and beef. Will come back to try i"}
{"text":"In terms of price,  not worth it! Portion of fries is small, burger tasted nice but barely any meat in it, it was mostly onions with a little bit of scattered beef. So not impressed by that. If you're going to compete with big fast food joint & be more expensive at least make the portions big. Took the cheapest combo on their menu & it came out to $12&change."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. You will not be disappointed. The duck heart is so well seasoned, the pork is so juicy and tender. My only complaint if you can even call it that, is the little spicy sauce they give you to dip the yuca fries is too small. The sauce tastes amazing by the way."}
{"text":"Went back for a second fix today. Had the Lomo saltado, and again... Perfection. Juicy, Crunchy, salty, sweet, damn I want another sandwich. I managed to take pictures before chowing down. My friend got the duck heart and it was also great. 

Enjoy friends!"}
{"text":"Wow. The duck heart burger is an instant contender for Montreal's best sandwich competition.

This is not exactly light fare, especially when accompanied by magnificent yucca chips but it is  sinfully good. 

Any proper carnivore really shouldn't be freaked out about eating aquatic fowl hearts. But for the less adventurous the lomo saltado is also delicious as I'm guessing the rest of the burgers are as well.

What a nice surprise among the generic food court offerings of the underground city! 

Food Gods, please keep 'em coming."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to imagine a quick lunch in a food court could be any better. I could have tried any of the sandwiches, but opted for chicken, rather than the more adventurous duck heart or various meat options. The service was fast. The sandwich was really good--marinated pulled chicken, caramelized onions, their sauce, and a few other ingredients.  I had the combo, and opted for the side salad and seltzer. Healthy, filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Great food for sure . however i do agree it is on the more expensive side for the portion size they offer"}
{"text":"Les hamburgers étaient très bons. La viande cuite à point. La salade avait un peu trop de vinaigrette et la sauce pour les frites est un peu insuffisante pour la quantité donnée.
Mais pour un restaurant dans un food court, ça vaut la peine."}
{"text":"I remember trying several items out when it first opened and liking it. Went recently and my opinion of the place is more or less the same. Price is a bit high for what you get but but taste-wise, it's quite good. Where else can you eat a burger of duck heart? It's slightly chewy but not too much and the sauce is pretty tasty. The yuca fries are also crispy, light and not too oily. It's also possible to get yuca fries with slices of sausage but I don't think it's worth the added cost."}
{"text":"Super Burger! Il y en a pour tout les goûts, du porc au canard en passant par du poulet ou du poisson; accompagné de succulentes frites aux Yuka.
Chaudement recommandé"}
{"text":"I really like that the burgers are so unique. My favorite is the one with sweet potatoes and fried pork. Their yuca fries are good also, crunchy and well seasoned. Overall one of the best places to grab a quick bite in downtown."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch option I've tried a few of their large selection of burgers (duck heart, haddock fish, Fried pork, Sirloin, Vegetarian,....). I'd say it pretty much blows any fast food chain out of the water.
The sirloin I had was full of flavour with red onions, crispy hickory chips inside and delicious spicy sauce. The meat was really savoury and was topped with gourmet burger bread!!! It's really nice to see a small place like this succeed in a food court full of generic fast food!!!"}
{"text":"I almost forgot about my meal from here, which says it all really. My sister and I picked up some sandwiches and yucca fries one night to try and it was disappointing (especially since she had previously said that she had really enjoyed their food). I ordered the chicharron sandwich (pork, sweet potato, etc.) and while there was nothing inherently wrong with it, there was nothing memorable about it either. Considering the other reviews, it's totally possible that it was just an off-night or I simply picked the wrong item. I did enjoy the cripsy yucca fries and sauce, but I'm not sure if I'd ever return to give the sandwiches another shot."}
{"text":"Feels like forever since I have written a review... oh wait, it really has been about that long :/ I guess it had to take something as amazing as Sandouchon to relight that Yelp spark!

Was brought here by some work colleagues today who raved about the burgers - I rarely eat at food courts so was tempted to see what all the fuss was about. Arriving at peak lunch-time, the queue was very long - that's always a good sign .
I ordered the Vegetarian Burger with Yuca fries and a drink. I have to say, the burger truly was made to perfection. The portion size was perfect, extremely filling and enough to keep you satisfied for long. 
I loved the phenomenal flavours - the chimichurri sauce alongside aubergine and mushroom tucked under a quinoa seeded bun absolutely blew me away - I would never have expected Portobello mushroom to taste this good. 

Yuca (or Cassava) is one of my favourite root vegetables that I feel is still not appreciated/known by many. To me, it beats potatoes/sweet potatoes and all the other starchy veg. The taste is totally unique. Sandouchon made the fries to perfection, super crispy, not overly salted and served with a spicy garlic sauce dip. 

The only downsides were that there was no ketchup and that there was only one person at the cash managing everything so he was quite rude and impatient. Other than that, great food, will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasty sandwiches, the yucca fries are spot on. Tried the lomo saltado (beef) sandwich and taste was great"}
{"text":"pretty fricking delicious
especially for a food court restaurant 
ur taste buds will thank you!!"}
{"text":"Having been to Peru and sampled a lot of the Peruvian dishes such as beef heart (anticuchos de corazon) I really anticipated trying this place out after seeing their ads on the metro billboards.  I recruited a Peruvian friend (who apparently had been the day before but it was so good, he wanted to go again the next day) to eat with me.  I went for the anticucho duck heart burger combo with yucca fries and it was yum!  The duck hearts (though smaller than beef hearts) were cut flat, seared in a pan till just medium done for juicy tenderness and seasoned just right. The sweet potato chips are great, usually its supposed to be thicker cut roasted sweet potato slices but I liked how the chips made it light and crunchy. The only thing is my sandwich seemed a little thin.  The yucca fries are nicely fried to a crisp and served with a spicy mayo.  If they actually make fresh chicha morada (purple corn juice), I think I'd have to come every week lol :)  My friend had the chicharron and was also very satisfied with the sandwich. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have never had Peruvian food in my life. This place is located beside my work so I decided to try it out on my lunch break. There was a huge lineup which is always a good sign. I ordered the chicken hearts burger with fries and an Inca Cola drink. That dish hit the spot. The hearts were juicy and to die for. I'll definitely go back again to try the other types of dishes."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian, I love this place! It is common in Perú to eat sanguchones, and I have to say, I was very happy when I heard about this place. This is the second time I go and the food is always great, like at home! I seriously love the sandwich of Lomo saltado with yucca fries and my chicha morada! The only reason I put 4stars instead of 5, is that the first time we went there with my husband, about a month ago, the guy that was at the front, wasn't very nice with us... My husband, not being peruvian, had a few questions and the guy was very cold and short in words for his answers. I was so excited to try a peruvian sandwich after so long and he ruined the moment for me. If I had written the review by then, I had put 3stars. But this second time a very nice  girl was there and she really pulled it off."}
{"text":"It's in a food court inside a mall, I know, but this is the best place to eat you will find in a food court inside a mall, guaranteed. I'm Peruvian and I approve this message:

The chifa sandwich is outstanding, and actually pretty close in taste to Chinese-Peruvian food back home. The crema de ají (spicy mayo) is delicious and I advice to ask for extra. Each sandwich can come in a combo with yucca fries, which are a pretty good alternative to mediocre soggy potato fries in other fast food places. They also carry real Inca Kola (not that Golden Kola scam made in the USA) and this is the perfect combination to a chifa sandwich (literally google \"chaufa con inca kola\", it's a sin to have those flavours with any other beverage). They also serve chica morada which is a sweet drink made from purple corn, don't be afraid to try that if you're eating literally anything else on their menu. 

I can't wait to try their version of poutine, it might just make it edible for me! Or the duck heart burger, we usually eat cow hears but duck must be even better and richer. 

The buns are really good quality, they take their sandwiches to another level, I almost don't wanna to call it fast food, but it's fast and good food. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem yesterday while walking to the Peel station. I was surprised that their side was Yuca fries and more surprised they had a Vegetarian option. The vegetarian option was great as also the fries.
I do feel the size of the burger was too small for the price $11."}
{"text":"When I say burgers and fries, you think of America but I think of Peru. Why is that? Because of a monster situated in Les Cours Mont-Royal called Sandouchon which grows a huge line of hungry workers during lunch time. Why are there so many people you ask? Once you try their crispy yet chewy yucca fries with their iconic Peruvian burger/sandwich you'll know exactly why the wait is worth your lunch break. If you are nearby Peel street or work around there then Sandouchon is a must try."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches... Very original combinations. Yuca fries are excellent as well. Service is friendly and rapid. The perfect lunch :)"}
{"text":"By my mouth I'd have to say this is one of the best sandwiches in the city!

If you haven't had duck hearts, you're missing out! If you haven't had a chicharron sandwich, get to this food court and got one! 
TRUST ME you'll be coming back as often as you can!"}
{"text":"I had the saltado burger. It's a burger with beef stripes. 

I wanted to go to this place to try their yuca fries. It's another name for manioc, a plant root. My only disappointment is the small portion of fries. By the way, you also have the choice of a salad.

If you're in a hurry you can go to this place to be served quickly and to take a place in the food court.

I'll definitely try to go back to try their other burgers with pork or chicken. I'm not sure about the anticucho with duck hearts!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, discovered this place by chance one day and their Lomo Saltado with yucca fries and sauce.   First time having any of that and it has become a lunchtime regular."}
