{"text":"Nothing taste good. I've had their breakfast, their tacos, and some other stuff. Since I leave near I gave them multiple chances but they never got it right."}
{"text":"Adios Roberto's hola El Charro. I went for the carnitas and they were delicious. Friendly staff but definitely in a hidden corner"}
{"text":"I had the #1 - 2 chicken tacos beans and rice for 4.99$.  It was delicious.  Added on a medium soda for a total of $6.83.  Was ready quick and food was great."}
{"text":"Making a turn to taco bell, we turned our heads to find this little taco shop right next to just breaks and meyers which i think is closed now, buy my family and I were extremly surpriced with the great quality of the food. Everything was super clean, and the staff made you feel very welcome by just stepping in. I'd definetly would advice you to come and check it out. I got a big carne asada burrito for less than $6!  Really impressed however, I'd give this place a 4.5 stars just because they take about 15 minutes to serve you your food if there are other people there, but the wait was definetly worth it. Coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great out of the way place for lunch or dinner. Great food and prices! Haven't had a bad experience yet and have been numerous tines!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos and they skimped on the cheese. When I asked for more cheese they said there will be an extra charge for that. It was basically nothing on my nachos. The rest of my order was greasy and soggy no comparison to the famous Roberto's. The portions are incredibly small and way overpriced. My recommendation find the nearest Roberto's and stay far away from this place. It's funny but chorro in Spanish means diarrhea"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food close to home.best take out cause gets hot inside.  It's has good flavor in the food."}
{"text":"This place stinks food is gross and they prepare it with bare hands. They don't use food prep gloves. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Ordered the #3, The carne asada burrito plate. They must've accidentally spilled a container of salt in thier rice? Because my food was too salty to eat. There was no way I could even finish my dinner. Also, besides the main entree- the portion for your sides are small too. Ive had better..Guess this will be my first & last time here!"}
{"text":"See \"Bud W.\" review. As you can tell this is a hole in the wall place but sooo much better tasting food than Roberto's. I don't know what they season the carne asada with but it gives it a much better flavor than the blandness of Roberto's. Always quick service and good service. Definitely worth the hunting, finding and stopping here. 9am-9pm"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. The girl inside was nice and the menu prices are fair. The carne asada burrito I had was lacking flavor and a bit fatty at times. I wasn't impressed with the quesadilla however the fried taco was so-so. I thought it was weird they had Christmas decorations up in September and inside could have been cleaner. The whole experience was under average I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well had an amazing burrito from here it was just a carne asada but it was very good ! I will be back to indulge and get my Mexican food fix =)

*side note* Their salsa bar is near the soda machine in a industrial cooler just look for the silver door near the soda fountain ."}
{"text":"The epitome of a mom and pop shop, the food is good, the portions large and the prices moderate. Already decided on huevos mexicana for Saturday breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have been on a mission to find a hole in the wall mexican restaurant and this is one of my favorites.  The salsa bar is my favorite! The burritos are great and it reminds me of some of the amazing mexican restaurants in southern california."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place that's a bit hidden. I only noticed it one day because I saw it driving from the opposite direction. Looks to be family owned and operated, which I appreciate and like. 

My sis and I ordered a torta of carne asada and I got two tacos to go. They had a nice salsa bar selection. I definitely liked the red salsa. The horchata was delicious. 

It's a small little restaurant but there is plenty of indoor seating. 

The food itself was okay, nothing too impressive. I felt like my torta was missing a lot of key ingredients like sour cream and guac. But the staff was very friendly and because of that I would give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Good food. Went in about 630p. Place was empty. Order to go was quick. Had chicken enchilada combo & a carne asada burrito. Cheap prices. Will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"on Saturdays and Sundays they serve menudo, best menudo I've had since I moved here to vegas, if I remember correctly the owners are from guadalajara and their recipe for menudo is on point, you can order it to go as well for la cruda (hangover) after a night of drinking.., everything on the menus great, from chile rellenos to California burritos, always great service with a smile. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and I don't remember it being this bad. First off I ordered a carne Asada chimichanga combo and paid $9.95. After I watched the cashier take 11 other people's order, she then began cooking after washing her hands with water only! Yuck! She took money from construction workers and then made my food. Not only that, once I cut into my burrito and tasted it, it tasted spoiled and it was soggy. I don't know if it was the guac or the sour cream but it was so gross I couldn't even eat it. If I wasn't so lazy I would have brought the whole thing back to them instead of throwing it in the trash! Gross! I'll never go back! Should have just went to Robertos smh"}
{"text":"This place seems somewhat hidden behind McChevron. Walking in we were greeted and given a chance to glance over the menu. The food is made fresh to order and they have a free salsa and veggie bar. Priced just under $3, I ordered a \"Cheese Quesdalilla\" and a \"Fried Beef Taco\" for around $2. Can't say I was a fan of the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted store bought and the cheese was lacking and had a somewhat pasty texture. The fried beef taco wasn't bad actually, but the chicken taco at Roberto's, grease and all, is by far better and larger in size. They have plenty of tables inside and you can call your order ahead of time too. The employees were very nice and inside was clean, but with other nearby options for lunch that I have enjoyed more and this place tasting average or just under, I can't see coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. I love the pollo fried tacos and the chili relleno burrito. Friendly staff also. If they only had tripa, it would be even better."}
{"text":"Best little Mexican food place around this area,it cheap great taste and nice people who work there. The chicken tacos are good so is the beans ,real Mexican food"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food here.  I had the carne asada torta and my husband had the chicken rolled tacos and we both agreed it's much much much better than Roberto's (not that this is the standard, but their menu reminds us of Roberto's). Let's face it, here in Aliante area there isn't much decent food places and it's nice to have good mom/pop taco shop.  We'll definitely be back to try more of their menu !"}
{"text":"I love that when I eat here they have real plates and bowls not styrofoam.  There food is great.  I love the chliaquiles.... There so good if you like spicy.  The rolled tacos are awesome and so is there breakfast burrito.  They are very friendly and I have never seen it dirty here at all.... It's really a nice quiet spot we like to go and we can eat in peace with out chaos"}
{"text":"Try the chilaquiles! Spicy but oh so very good. The sauce is made in house- abuelita style."}
{"text":"For starters, you can easily miss this place if you are not paying attention because it is tucked away behind the Chevron/McDonalds and next to a service station. 

On my first visit I got the number 8 which is normally a Beef Burrito, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, and Refried beans. Since I do not eat meat, they were happy to substitute a bean burrito instead. I had no idea how much food could really fit into a little take away container! The bean burrito was huge and tasted fresh. The beans were seasoned well. None of those bootleg, bland bean burritos you will find at other Mexican places in town. The enchilada was also amazing and did not get lost in sauce. Although most people focus on the main dish, I must say the rice and refried beans on the side were amazing as well. None of the watery, flavorless beans or burnt crispy rice you are served elsewhere. While they are making your food (less than 6 minute wait for fresh take-out), you can visit the \"salad bar\" and get plenty of sauces to take home and try. I prefer the hotter sauces, but they have a wide variety. 

On my next visit, I just wanted a quick snack and got the chips and guacamole and that hit the spot. Freshly made chips and tangy guacamole was just what I needed!

Once your food is ready, get a big cup of Lemonade or Horchata and you are ready to roll out like an autobot!"}
{"text":"Fabuloso! I had a chicken chimichanga and it was HUGE and so delicious! We also ordered some chips and guac and they FRESHLY FRIED the chips. So, so good! Everything was fresh and the portions were large. This will be our new go-to quickie dinner spot. I just docked one star because I wish they served beer."}
{"text":"We will definitely come back! $20 for two and the portions are huge! There's also a small salsa bar, all of which are pretty good! If you're in this area of town and want to get a quick lunch that's not your standard fast food fare this place is perfect."}
{"text":"I can't figure out the rave reviews people are giving this place. There is virtually no difference between this and other hole-in-the-wall Mexican fast food places like Robertos.  The prices must have been raised since opening, because the #1 meal for $4.99 is now $5.99.  I had the asada burrito, which tasted good but I found gristle in almost every bite.  My wife had the asada taco salad, which was $7.00, and was not very big.  Overall, I thought it was a bit overpriced for what you get.  We were the only people there and it still took about 15 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! We get the chilaquiles every few weekends! Amazing! Mommas cooking and papas running the front! True authentic Mexican!"}
{"text":"El Charro's Taco Shop is a great place for breakfast, or conversely, breakfast for dinner. I would recommend the Charro breakfast special ($6.99). It's pretty darn spicy and comes with a side of rice and beans. It's basically Chilaquiles. The huevos rancheros is another great dish. I think it's the #11. It comes with over-easy eggs layered in between corn tortillas topped with a red sauce. Shredded lettuce, pico de gallo, and a side of rice and beans accompany the dish. 

It's a family affair at El Charro's! The husband is the owner and is on the register sometimes, the wife cooks, and a younger girl who I'm assuming to be the daughter cashiers as well. I love family restaurants! Customer service is great and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"This was an interesting little discovery.  It is in a small strip mall that is mostly empty next to a tire shop.  You have to literally drive through here to find. 

It is basically a quick serve taco shop akin to a Roberto's.  

I had a chicken taco plate.  It was pretty good.  It seems they put more effort into their food and service than they do at most taco shops.  

The prices are noticeably lower than other taco shops.  Very reasonable prices.  Overall, the food and the prices are a good value.  I gotta say, this will be my taco shop of choice in this area."}
{"text":"A food catering truck has better food than this restaurant... Service is good but the food is gross... Wouldnt recommend"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was very good! The salsa was too, but the lady at the register wasn't friendly at all, she had this face like she was being bothered that I placed an order. So customer service lacks otherwise I would have given this place 5 stars"}
