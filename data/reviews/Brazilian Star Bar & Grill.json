{"text":"Food was OK for a Brazilian restaurant in a foreign country (the food never taste the same as hen you are in Brazil). The price was reasonable and the place was nice."}
{"text":"I started going to the Brazilian Star about 5 years ago. I love their Picanha and Alcatra steaks. The side dishes are just an amazing compliment to the soft and juicy steaks.  Their dessert, traditional brigadeiro just melts in your mouth!!! They also make the best Caipirinhas so if you go there please order one. Prices have gone drastically up since I first started going there and when I say drastically, I mean drastically and it hasn't been gradually after the renovation the prices went up by almost 4$.  I haven't been back since that time but I really would like to go soon!!!"}
{"text":"It satisfy my nostalgia for Brazilian food and atmosphere. Not pretension and seems to have a mostly large Brazilian community coming to this restaurant. They serve authentic Feijoada on weekend with a cold beer. Very rare.  Now I just need the sun and beach."}
{"text":"This one will be to brazilians:
Sou un apreciador de massas... Enquanto no Brasil, deixava de apreciar a comida brasileira porque pouco me apetecia.
Ao chegar nesse restaurante, fui logo apresentado à um ambiente agradabilíssimo.

O prato escolhido foi carne assada, acompanhada por arroz, purê de batata e feijão.

Posso lhe dizer que sempre que puder, voltarei a esse ilustre local para saborear esse prato maravilhoso o qual eu nã havia notado, até então, em minha própria casa.

Para finalizar a noite com chave de ouro, um tradicional pudim de leite com gostinho de querro mais."}

We went to this restaurant with a Brazilian friend who was in Toronto for a few weeks on a visit. His eyes lit up when we suggested getting a taste of home food and the title of our review is how he described his food when it arrived !!!

I know very little about Brazilian cuisine but I do know that I enjoyed my Picanha with cheese and he confirmed that his food (fish) was excellent too. The other two in our party also enjoyed their dinners.

I later spoke with another Brazilian acquaintance who lives in Toronto and he too confirmed that he regards this as the best and most authentic Brazilian restaurant in TO.

I can only defer to these guys on the authenticity and confirm that I enjoyed my food, enjoyed the friendly service, and the decor and ambience. Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I think I had higher expectations of this place. Thinking we were going to a Brazilian steak house I thought they're really know their meat. But, as Melinda M said, the steaks were thin, and kind of tough. I'd just say it was okay. 

While the staff was nice, the whole feeling wasn't really comforting and inviting."}
{"text":"+ Very good food
+ They serve pretty authentic brazilian food
+ homemade delicious food
+ Simple and not fancy restaurant.
+ Very good price
+ Amazing mandioquinha and beans
(*) The only point for improvement are the facilities itself. The restaurant is too narrow, so if its crowded it gets a bit uncomfortable, but nothing that compromises the experience."}
{"text":"I ordered picanha  but it was like ordinary steak. No rice no black beans and doesn't look Brazilian picanha?!?;)."}
{"text":"It sucks when a place you want to go to is closed but thankfully Yelp showed us this place around the corner!

We walked in and were greeted and sat in Portugese....sweet, how can I not love that?  Did I mention the girls who sat/served us were very cute?  Ok maybe I should have.

We decided to order a main with some appetizers and we ended up getting Brazilian chicken balls, empada and the stew.

The empada was ok but the chicken was slightly dry.  The Brazilian chicken ball was AWESOME!  I loved the batter that the chicken was wrapped in.  I can't explain it but I really would have ate 5 of these for dinner that night had I not ordered other things.  The stew came out and it was a very nice portion.  I'm normally indifferent to beans but I have to admit I liked these ones.  The veggies were, veggies and we got a large portion of meat.  I found the meat a little dry but if you can mix it in with the fat it's pretty awesome.

When the bill arrived I think we got the awesome discount because they seemed to have discounted all our items.  SWEET!!!  

I will definitely be back as I saw some of the other items people ordered.  I think we were feeling adventurous and wanted to try some Brazilian food I had never tried before. I'll definitely mix it up with things I know are winners and other new items the next time I'm in.  

Did I mention the cute waitresses?"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my bf the other night, neither of us have had Brazilian food. The few customers inside the restaurant all spoke Portuguese and the waitresses spoke minimal English, they did not seem knowledgeable about the items on the menu either. 

AWFUL service, we had to try several times to flag down the waitress just to make our order. 

Our mixed appetizers platter came out icy COLD in the middle, clearly they were frozen and just thrown in the deep fryer. Really? Charging $9 for a few pieces of frozen breaded meats? The waitress didn't seem to care either, she just brought it back to the kitchen and re-fried the same pieces. Disgusting.

For the main course, we each got the Brazilian steak. It came with rice, beans, fries, and a bland un-dressed salad. It was a lot of food, but it was all tasteless. We didn't even finish half of our food. We got our steak in medium, we didn't dare go for anything medium-rare because we're worried the kitchen wouldn't cook it properly like the appetizers.. I'd rather NOT get food poisoning, thanks. The steak was also thin, too fatty, and too salty. Yuck.

Overall, what a terrible first time experience with Brazilian food. My bf and I don't ever want to eat it again, heck, we don't even want to visit Brazil. Yes, it was that disappointing."}
{"text":"Just to give you a sense of how this place has been in a \"roller coaster\" for me, due to many factors/aspects that have changed throughout the time I've been going there, I'll give some highlights of the different experiences I've had in this restaurant.

On my first visit the service and food were brilliant in every aspect. I was really happy and ended up going back the following weekends.

The third time I went there, and the following three visits, everything was awful. Unfortunately, our server had a bad attitude at al times, not paying attention to whAt we were ordering, making faces every single time we wanted something else, and throwing our orders on the table quite rudely. On top of that, we went with a couple more friends, and instead of giving us the normal size portions, of what we've ordered in our previous visits, they gave us half of everything for the same price, and also said that if we wanted to get more, we'll get charged again.

We didn't come back for at least 6 months, until today (May 18, 2014). The food was still as good as before. We had the Alcatra ($28 for two), which consists in a portion of white rice, pinto beans, yuca, Coles salad and a steak. We were four, and we were scared they'd give us a small portion, but no, they served what we're supposed to get.

The waitress was brilliant; kind, efficient, with a smile on her face all the time. 

The prices still the same, on average you'll spend about $18 to $22 per person. 

I won't give it five stars due to the bad experiences I've had before. However, judging by today, I could say it has improved."}
{"text":"Super value for the money.  Tasty food without a lot of pretense.

The chicken dinner is served for 1, but is enough for 2 or even a small family.  Crazy big portions.

Like so many restaurants in this strip, the decor is nothing to write home about, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I was less impressed than the other reviewer: disappointed really. I probably should give two stars but the server was nice and eager - even if he couldn't speak English well enough to explain the difference between any of the steak dishes.

I actually thought the prices were high for what we got. The steaks (it's Brazilian, I figured you couldn't go wrong with steaks!) were thin and way over-cooked. Hi! I ordered medium rare and you gave me well-done! We did get salads and rice and beans and fries and lots of sides so I guess it fits. The food just wasn't good enough.

They had a singer/guitarist who was playing along to American classic rock tunes piped in somehow. His voice was good. 

Weird scene, but nice staff. I hear the Saturday night special steak is good, but I doubt I'll bother to try it. This just didn't impress me at all."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I really enjoyed Brazillian Star.  Very lively (lots of regulars at the bar gave the place a nice neighbourhood feel) and the food was delicious.  Be sure to order the feijoada (only available on Saturdays).  And the service was excellent.  Super efficient and friendly.  The best restaurant experience I've had in ages.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I was really craving a coxinha and was directed here by a Brazilian friend. The coxinha here was way better than any of the ones I had in Florianopolis. Dough and chicken ratio was perfect. Did not feel like I was getting ripped off with just dough. Mmmm I want one now. Oh also tried the bolinha...or whatever that beef ball was called. It was too greasy and did not like it as much. Service was ok. Was kind of too hot in there, need more fans and air circulation. Over-all, I will go back for my coxinha  needs. (I was also told they have pastel! will have to try that next time)"}
