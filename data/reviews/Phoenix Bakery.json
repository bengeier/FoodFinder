{"text":"This bakery has moved to Gerrard east of Broadview and it's now part restaurant with a bakery on one side still.  I've had good experiences with the quality and value of the pastries here.  The service and decor design is the only part that keeps me from giving this a highest rating so it's really closer to 4.5 stars.  The service is not bad but it's typical of what you'll expect in Chinatown and better than the one known as Chinese Bakery on Dundas West.  There are actually only a handful of bakeries at this smaller Chinatown and they're all close in quality, size and prices.  Phoenix has a great mango bubble tea that costs only $3.  We had one around the corner at Tung Hing Bakery and it costs more and uses some powder which made it a banana-yellow colour and funny tasting instead of orange-yellow which was more expensive.  If this place was closer to home, I would be coming here after having dim sum a few doors over at Pearl Court (just reviewed)"}
{"text":"This place is dirty, not just the tables and floors.    I will never ever eat at this place again even if this is the last Chinese bakery on Earth."}
{"text":"I have been to many Chinese bakeries all over Toronto, Scarborough, and Markham. This place has a big selection, but average buns. I don't recommend the hot food at the back. I had some 4 days ago and have had food poisoning ever since. The place is very dirty and the meat was very poor quality so I'm not too surprised. I definitely will not go back here."}
{"text":"It is pretty obvious they do not want white or brown customers. I have been here 3 times and was not happy with the cleanliness either. Probably why they have now changed the name to NEW BAKERY. The only plus is they don't charge sales tax."}
{"text":"Their pastries are fresh and they run out before the end of the day so be sure to stop by early enough. Did I say it is cheap as well? Not to mention their chinese cuisine to go, you will get plenty for very little money and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"i'm regular there as i live across the road so i kno how bad the quality of their food is.  idk what they will have to put in their stir fry noodles to make it taste bitter like poison but i rly don't wanna kno.  their cakes contains egg shells which add the already plain taste of the cake itself a even worse flavor.   idk what those contanese ppl eating there everyday it seems always busy maybe thats what cantonese ppl eat irl.  and the green veggie in the stir fry is always unwashed, every single bite my mouth is full of sands i'm not even joking. don't swallow it as u will grow stones in ur guts."}
{"text":"I am sitting here looking at a huge container of unfinished food. Real waste of money eating from their hot food side. There is a lot of it, it was only six dollars. This is by far the worst Chinese takeout I've ever had in my life and I am not very hard to please. Maybe the baked goods are better, but for the love of everything good in this world do not eat their hot food. I'm so hungry now and I don't have time to get something else. I'm using my remaining lunch minutes to write this review and hopefully prevent someone from sharing my soggy, gross, salty, slightly rotten smelling fate."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place.  The choices are limited and the vegetables are always very soggy no matter what the dish is.  Both times I've been, the places was full of flies and the floor very dirty. Add in an unpleasant odor and you don't want to come back again.  They have all the typical Chinese baked goods, which I have ordered some rice and peanut cakes, which were surprisingly delicious.  I only came here twice because both times I was in a rush and a sub $5 lunch attracted me.  I will go elsewhere if I need Chinese baked goods because their lunch buffet is nothing to sing home about."}
{"text":"On days where I don't bring my usual lunch, my co-workers and I would hit up this bakery for quick bite.   The bakery is generally packed during lunch time, but there is ample seating to fit the crowd. The place is kept clean, Chinese music playing in the background, and sometimes, movies are viewed on their 2 flat screen TV projectors.  You can also order noodles/rice/congee with a choice of 7-8 side dishes. A meal with 3 side dishes comes to $4.30, along with soup. A choice of 4 dishes is about a dollar more. Trust me. 3 side dishes is more than enough! They rotate their food items daily, which gives variety for regular customers.  Note: They're opened 7:30am in the morning. I usually get my usual hot milk tea before work. And it's GOOD!"}
{"text":"This bakery is your typical Chinatown bakery - cheap, tasty, with lots of options. On any given day, there are sweet buns, salty buns, meat buns, plain buns, and also a variety of cakes and rolls as well as lunch counter food. The quality isn't the best, but most buns are 2 for $1 so no complaints there! The restaurant side with seating seems to attract a lot of the locals here which is pretty cool. I always pick up a few of the red bean buns as well as the tuna buns to go for a quick snack on the run :)"}
{"text":"Nothing beats getting some piping hot good HK milk tea at 7:30am. Other than HK style buns they have congee, noodles, fried goodies to go with it for breakfast as well."}
{"text":"It tends to be packed during the day but I've never had any problems from getting my baked goods and paying. My mom always stops by after work to buy some buns or last minute food for dinner. Sometimes they sell cake trimmings for I believe $2 which makes for a nice snack. There is a decent sitting area but don't expect it to be absolutely quiet since there would be some people socializing. However, they're regular customers and always happily greet their friends and my mom whenever she goes in, lol. The employees there are super nice too!"}
{"text":"I go here sometimes when I'm feeling poor and need to buy food for breakfast / brunch.  Their buns are super cheap and filling.  I love hotdog buns, curry beef buns and chicken buns and they're 2 for $1.  They also have egg tarts at 3 for $1 or 2 big ones for $1.  I also like their sponge cake \"swiss rolls\".  They have different flavours like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, green tea and honeydew!  I'm going to be trying the honeydew this time.  My only complaint is that their hotdog bun is too big (too much pastry, not enough hotdog) and they don't carry these buns that have the sweet yellow filling inside.  But overall, the service is friendly and the food is cheap and satisfying.  Perfect for students on a budget... or just anyone on a budget for that matter."}
{"text":"Sign at same address 615 Gerard Street East now says \" New Bakery\".  Went with a friend ordered lunch from buffet. I found a COCKROACH cooked into noodles!!!! Both of us were ill !  Asked for money back.  Cashier was unapologetic and unsurprised. Only wanted to refund one lunch as we did not find another roach in the second plate.  Finally did but was not happy about it.   Called health department. They received major violation yellow warning for 3 days. Apparently exterminator sprays over open pots of food cooking. Roaches crawling on walls fell into pots.   Never stepping foot there again!! Stay Away !!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bakery for years. I was a patron when it used to be on Broadview Avenue. The bakery then relocated to a larger store around the corner on Gerrard Street East.   The currently location used to be two stores. The wall was knocked down. Facing the doors as if you are going into the bakery, the right side has plenty of tables and chairs where you can sit there and sip your milk tea at your leisure or chow down on your food item purchases. The left side of the store has a ton of baked goods, a section that serves hot food, and the cashier area.   I tend to buy tons of buns, cake, and dessert items. I have yet to fetch a hot meal here. I will someday!  The buns are smaller in size, which I like. You can eat more than one bun without feeling guilty and you can sample nor flavours. I love the steamed buns, such as the mushroom and pork, and barbeque pork. You can also get baked buns, such as the curry beef and yummy chicken.   Don't forget dessert! I love the sticky coconut balls with peanut filling. I also like the green tea Swiss roll, savoury bacon and green onion roll, and mango coconut cake. Yummy all around.   This bakery only accepts cash. Service is quick and friendly.   I tend to do a bakery run to this Chinatown once a month. This one is always on my list.   (102)"}
{"text":"Tip: do not try the lunch box here. The most gross lunch box I have eaten in years.  I am not sure it is the bakery, on google map, it says the name is \"New Bakery\". However, the Chinese name of the bakery actual means \"Phoenix Bakery\". And this is this bakery I found in East Chinatown. One day, I was really hungry, and I saw the sign on the door saying $5 lunch. I had many cheap lunch box before and the quality was not bad. However, this place is very bad. The place is pretty dark and has many old people there. I ordered rice noodle and deep fried fish. The rice noodle was so oily. The fish has gone bad and it deep fried it anyway. The good thing about this place is it does not charge tax and it gives you free soup. I threw away my lunch box at the end."}
