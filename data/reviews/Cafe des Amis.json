{"text":"Second time here and disappointed compared to last. The cashier person wasn't friendly what so ever and the same croque Monsieur i got last time was overly cheesy and just not very good. Inconsistent. The other people that came with me did not like it either."}
{"text":"Why oh why does Cafe des Amis have to be in Sewickley???   I had the mushroom duxelles crepes (one of the specials last weekend) and the tomato salad. The crepes were very good, and I love the choice of side dishes-- they had interesting options. My husband had chicken/bacon crepes with a garden salad and enjoyed them as well.  My kids ordered the best thing, though-- French toast. They used a fresh baguette and it had slightly caramelized bananas on top. It came with caramel sauce and whipped cream. When the waitress brought it out and saw that my kids were going to share, she not only brought an extra plate, she put extra whipped cream on it so they could each have their own little pile of cream. It was *ridiculously* good, thanks to the bread.  Overall, this a nice little cafe that is surprisingly kid-friendly. Oh, and if anyone with a more exciting life than me ever feels like boozing it up at lunch (they close at 3, I think), it's BYOB sans corkage fee."}
{"text":"I got the BLTTA (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, Tomato and Avocado). It was very delicious. I was expecting more turkey and bacon on the sandwich but this detail was no a deal breaker for me.  The staff was friendly and the food arrived at a restaurants speed. If you're in a rush I would not recommend this café. It is not a fast food joint. It has a very laid-back and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"10/10 would definitely recommend. All food freshly made there. Portions big. Atmosphere casual and friendly. Best crepes ever."}
{"text":"Besides the greasy sandwich with an disgusting amount of cheese on it and the tiny cup of flavorless french onion soup not only was the place filthy dirty and filled with flies but the lady who took our order was unpleasant and rude. I found myself wishing I would find a fly in my food so I could get my money back and go eat somewhere else. Below panera quality with a higher cost."}
{"text":"Cafe des Amie is hit or miss.  One day it will be a pleasant experience, and then the next time you start to wonder how they're able to stay open.    The food is pretty good and always fresh.  I like their omelets because they're light and fluffy, not dripping with grease (but I do need to add some salt).  I appreciate fresh ingredients and will pay a little more for them.  This place can get very expensive, though, for what it is.  You order and pay at a counter and basically take care of your own drinks, clean up, etc.  The prices are out of line with this self-service atmosphere.  Sometimes the staff will bring your food to you, but other times we've had to return to the counter to check on the food.   We are a family of four and can easily spend $40-50 here at lunch, or breakfast even.  That's way too much for a place that's basically a glorified Ikea cafeteria.  I agree with other reviewer's assessment of the staff.  Not the warmest bunch of ladies.  I went in once late in the morning to sit down with a coffee and read my email in the corner.  Oh the looks they gave me!  I couldn't understand it.  I was the only customer in a room full of empty tables, and they were looking at me like I was sitting there slowly sipping my drink during the rush with people lined up out the door.  I guess I'll stick with Starbucks for my break time."}
{"text":"A special birthday and a place that would accommodate all ages (3-71). The Brunch couldn't have been better. The owner reserved a small room for our group complete with Happy Birthday decorations. She was very approachable and made certain that our group was handled efficiently. Being Valentine's Day the restaurant was very busy, but we never felt rushed. We all had different items ranging from \"light as air\" quiche to chocolate chip pancakes. Everything was great. We have already made plans to return in two weeks."}
{"text":"A wonderful little French Cafe tucked away on Division Street (a little hard to find and limited parking) is my new favorite place to visit when I am in town.  The quiche is a amazing and Cafe Amis offers a fresh new assortment daily.  The side salads are fresh, flavorful and inventive.  My son loved the French Toast - warm fresh bread, carmalized bananas sprinkled with powdered sugar and of course lots of syrup.  Ca t wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast - cool place.  Had the pancakes - 3 HUGE pancakes - I could barely eat 1 1/2 of them - and they were awesome.   Heard the crepes are good too.  Looks like a great lunch place - I will have to return."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Cafe des Amis.  Mostly because it's 5 minutes away from my house and the menu looked so appealing.  When you get there, it's a totally different story.  Let's start with the surly staff.  We needed a table cleaned off and had asked for some help with that.  Quite a bit of huffing and puffing about it and a fair amount of eye rolling.  Sorry, we just wanted to have lunch here and pay you for it...  We ordered at the counter - 3 entrees in all to feed our family of 4.  We ordered the mac and cheese (bubbling hot and delicious looking but very bland), escargots (also bland) and a breakfast entree (I don't recall what it was exactly).  The food hit the spot (our family was really quite famished) but were not wowed by what we ordered and certainly not bowled over by the service.    We did end up ordering a Nutella and banana crepe after someone else next to us ordered a sweet crepe.  This was by far the best tasting item we ordered and the best value, too.  Though this place is pretty close to home, I'll probably not be back.  For what we paid, food and service just didn't add up.    The hunt for a French place in Pittsburgh continues..."}
{"text":"A true local gem in Sewickley! Cute, casual atmosphere with many delicious breakfast & lunch options.  Insider info: it's BYOB PS- get the croissant egg sandwich"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood gem, great food and service. You order at the front and waiters will bring food. Great breakfast and a good place for takeaway. Specials every week, and lots of go sides that you can order by the pound. Very kid friendly and you can call for a table especially if you have a group for brunch on Sunday"}
{"text":"This place is just OK. Basic food, mediocre preparation, definitely not French. Maybe French inspired? If you're looking of a easy, basic meal, no frills and moderately good, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's alright. Only place to get breakfast in Sewickley.  Affordable, food is alright, not great. It's not awful it's not amazing, it's...meh."}
{"text":"Such a perfect little lunch place!  I came here twice when I was in the area.  Order food at the bakery counter- the menu is somewhat limited to omelets, salads, sandwiches, and crepes, but there's surprising depth to it.  My first visit I had a cup of chili with pumpkin pancakes, and on my second visit I had a spinach and goat cheese crepe with a side of chipotle sweet potatoes.   Everything was delicious!  The one thing I'd point out is that the food is good, but the service and appearance of the place are decidedly casual.  This is the kind of place where parents feel comfortable bringing their screaming babies and where table service is spotty.  But the food, the food, the food!"}
{"text":"The quiche is to die for and the crepes are so big here, I can't even finish them. I just love the food here at the little French cafe, but both the service and the environment leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot in Sewickley. Always good and the service is just right! Their sandwiches are the best and they have a nice selection of side dishes to pick from."}
{"text":"Family of four ate there for lunch- tuna melt, ham and cheese with onion soup, buffalo chicken wrap with potatoes, salad marche', bread pudding, and chocolate torte. Delicious! Best place we've eaten in Sewickley, even if it's not super authentically French. Will eat there again, soon I hope. I wish the outdoor seating was bigger and more inviting."}
{"text":"Myself and a coworker were in town for a meeting and arrived early to catch lunch and stumbled upon Cafe Des Amis.  The initial impression is just that of a lunch shop but when you approach the counter and look into the display cases of the lunch and desert items it is quickly apparent that this is no ordinary deli.  They had escargot on the menu and in the case!  I had a lunch croissant with chicken salad and my coworker had it with tuna.  Sides are also interesting like ratatouille and french onion soup.  Drink selection is minimal however.  The chicken salad was amazing and the croissants were delicious, the tuna was also great according to my coworker.  And just because it was a French restaurant we had to have a crepe for desert which didn't disappoint.  This place is just a little hidden gem outside of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So glad there's a French restaurant in this area. The food is excellent, I'll drive 30 minutes out of the way to eat here. Awesome crepes and the Quiche Lorraine is my favorite. Also stopped in on a snowy morning and was surprised with some pumpkin pancakes on special that were great!"}
{"text":"Update: We continue to go here almost weekly, just some new suggestions:  3 bean salad is a solid choice. I order it almost every time tomato salad is my other go to, nice amount of basil in this one raspberry tart is a new discovery and my new absolute favorite skip the nutella cookie, it wasn't rich enough chocolate tart is definitely rich enough and a solid choice. It was too sweet for me for breakfast, but I don't ever like sweets early in the morning.  My husband still comes home 1-2 nights a week with bread pudding from here. It has raspberry and chocolate. He loves it."}
{"text":"First time here and I had a delicious shrimp salad, perfect for a Lenten lunch"}
{"text":"One of the surprisingly few brunch options in the Village, the Cafe brings fresh ingredients into every menu item. Omelettes are on point; quiches, and salads are also worth trying. Can be very crowded due to the high demand for breakfast and lack of Village options."}
{"text":"If you are looking for QUALITY breakfast/lunch food or pastries, Cafe des Amis is THE place to be.  We either go there or get takeout from there at least once a week.  The food is consistent and delicious and the atmosphere is cute and very casual.  My  \"go to\" is the breakfast veggie wrap that is filled with eggs, tons of yummy vegetables and feta cheese - SO GOOD!! The orzo is my favorite side dish - always seasoned so perfectly. I also enjoy the crepes (both sweet and savory) and the delicious sandwiches at lunch time.  If you can, save some room for a raspberry tart - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really fresh food in a charming location.  The staff were helpful and friendly, this is a very pleasant place for lunch.  I do like the food, but it seems a bit on the American side, I wish it could be more savory...more, well French!  The make omelettes all the time, there's a nice selection of quiches, crepes, salads, and desserts.  I'll be be back, this is a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"After a lucky break finding a nearby parking space, we ventured into this establishment.  The order is placed at the counter & your food is brought to you. Self service for the beverages.  I had the western omelette & roasted red potatoes.  My meal was flavorful & the portion size was very generous.  My husband had the crepe with egg, bacon & cheese w/ a side of roasted red potatoes. Again, generous portion & full of flavor.  The atmosphere was lively. It's a bonus that a lot of the food is prepared where you have a clear view of the process. There is also a display case full of culinary delights.  I only wish there was better ventilation as it was a bit smoky from the non-stop activity at the grills.  I enjoyed my experience overall & look forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"Have been to cafe des Amis many times. Thought it was time to provide a review.   This is a great little place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. I am very fond of their assorted quiches and soups while my daughters love their crepes especially the nutella one. I have even stopped by to pick up dessert to bring home. The chocolate tart was delicious.   You walk in and order from the menu, when the food is ready they bring it to your table. The wait is not long. They keep the tables very clean, very efficient.  The only drawback is the atmosphere is a bit dull. Plastic tablecloths.  Needs a little warming up in the decor. Maybe some upbeat french jazz background music.   This is one of our favorite places in sewickley to go for brunch on the weekend. Family friendly and you don't feel rushed. Grab a paper and relax. Have something good to eat and then go on and order dessert. It will be delicious."}
{"text":"Very good Omelettes, French Toast, Pies Bread Pudding, Crepes, something for everybody. Reasonably priced fast service, does get busy."}
{"text":"Super cute and yummy! I will definitely be back. I need to make this a weekend breakfast spot for sure!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch at Cafe Des Amis on a couple occassions and each time I really enjoyed my lunch. They have a wonderful selection of sandwiches, salads, quiches, and crepes...all reasonably priced.  I've never had the brunch, but the lunch is so good that I'd love to come by on the weekend to try that menu too."}
{"text":"Very cute little French inspired cafe, but the food is definitely Americanized. I ordered a breakfast crêpe and it was delicious, but a little greasy for my liking. Clean dining area, mostly affordable prices. Very friendly service at the counter. If you're like me, you probably won't be able to leave without grabbing something from the front food display-- everything looked really tasty!"}
{"text":"Plentiful portions for breakfast, brunch and lunch, as well as plentiful options of the menu. Heaping salads, packed sandwiches, \"all day\" breakfast omelets with your choice of a side (salad, fruit, etc) and breakfast/dessert crepes happening at all times. Desserts like chocolate mousse and french pastries are also on hand.   In a quick trip to Sewickly, I ate here twice - breakfast one day, lunch another. Had a salad and the pancakes. Friends had crepes, omelets and sandwiches. No complaints. Go with your craving - I don't think you can go wrong.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"This place is the worst, I have eaten here twice, both times the food had no flavor, and I got sick. Also you would expect a French restaurant to have at least subpar coffee, this place serves the same tasteless coffee my English grandma made in the mornings. No French accents here, just some hard core Pittsburghese."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was grabbing coffee nearby and asked a local a good place for lunch. He recommended this adorable little French cafe.   Their menu has a great list of sandwiches and salads. They also have a ton of sides such as roasted red potatoes , macaroni & cheese, sauteed apples ect.  I decided on the BLTTA-- bacon lettuce tomato turkey avocado. It was served on a buttery croissant and i got to choose one side. I went with a side salad. I decided to eat in.  My sandwich was fabulous and the salad was hearty. Their salad dressing was great but unsure of the dressing.. Possibly French lol   I noticed someone's French onion soup and it looked great! Stop in you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Always look forward to eating either breakfast or lunch here. Specials of the day are amazing as is the regular daily menu. Prices are average and generous portions for your buck. Space is a little cramped however they do open space across the hallway for more seating. Get the yummy banana walnut pancakes :) Everything here is tasty."}
{"text":"Tasteless food for the high prices. The French onion soup was terrible. Under broiled, watery taste, plain in every way. The burrito had no flavor too. The only flavorful thing was the macaroni salad and that's because it had a ton of pepper... If you're into that..."}
{"text":"I'm pretty pleased with Cafe Des Amis - from my apartment I'm able ot walk to get breakfast on a lazy weekend morning so that fact alone helps it be very appealing to me. I am a big fan of the order, sit, and food is brought out - especially at breakfast. I've been twice so far and first time ordered the french toast with bananas- which was pretty awesome; second trip ordered a crepe - also was pretty good. When they get busy it's a little tough to come by coffee. It would probably benefit them to use a larger dispenser because I got half a cup and my boyfriend was out of luck until the next batch came out - then when it did there was a line of about 5 people all clammering for coffee. The more they put into it the better the experience is going to be for their customers.   A tip - there are real coffee cups, not just styrofoam. I hate drinking out of styrofoam so if anyone is like me you can get real coffee cups.   It's a nice place to go when cereal doesn't cut it..."}
{"text":"Food was great! Had a lovely time with the fam. Def worth going and will be back. Didn't have the biggest wow factor but still very good and would recommend to others. Staff was nice and friendly. Food quick and hot."}
{"text":"Everything we had was great. The French toast was my favorite. We will definitely return. Staff was friendly and super helpful."}
{"text":"We had such a lovely experience here! I made a reservation for 10am on a Saturday for 2 because I wasn't sure how busy it would be and my sister was visiting from out of town. We showed up at 10:10 and the lady at the counter was so nice about us being late and pointed out our reserved table. We probably would have had to wait 10-15 minutes otherwise for a table.  We ordered 2 breakfast entrees and 2 lattes at the counter which totaled $21--totally reasonable for a delicious breakfast for 2. The banana French toast was absolutely incredible. I had never had French toast made with baguettes before--it was so thick and crunchy and the combination of that and the bananas and whipped cream made me want to scarf the whole plate down. We also split a strawberry crepe that was delicious. The lattes were a little weak but still good. Very friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great gem in Sewickley, tucked away on a side street, it is very quaint neighborhood cafe with a great atmosphere!  I've had breakfast and lunch here and I've never been disappointed.  I'm a fan of their croissant sandwiches, crepes, and they always have delicious side dish options."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment this place is.  The only thing \"French\" about this place is a lot of pictures of the Eiffel Tower. We went there for breakfast and got two different omelets. The omelets were bland and uninspired. I got the side of roasted potatoes. They were made with that gross processed garlic in a jar, and judging that they were nuclear hot inside and cold outside they microwave them to heat them up. Wifey got a side of baked apples which were good, but its pretty tough to mess that one up.  It's a sad day when I regretted not going to eat n park."}
{"text":"I ate here a few Sunday's ago with my girlfriend and her parents for brunch.  I had found the place on yelp and was excited to see that it seemed like a cute little European marketplace inside.  The menu was written on a chalkboard with a variety of salads and sandwiches with another chalkboard to the side with savory crepes.  I decided on a coffee with the special of the day which was an avocado, sunny side up egg and bacon on a ciabatta and decided on the three bean salad as my side.  The bread for my sandwich was awesome with it being nice and chewy.  The avocado and bacon on my sandwich tasted nice as well with my only regret being that I didn't get the egg scrambled.  The three bean salad was good with a sweet vinegar type sauce.  All of my dining companions also enjoyed their meals as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I liked the feel of the place and the food was good as well."}
{"text":"Met friends for breakfast. Got there about 8, they open at 7. The place was empty and quiet. Had the waffle ...with real whipped cream and powdered sugar. Nothing special. The guys had the french toast. It was very sweet and the use baguettes, not good. The roll got hard and neither of the guys finished it. Their coffee was good but the mugs were super small. True it's self serve coffee but you can get up 4 times to have enough. We used the to go foam cups. Much better. Also had the garden omelette. That was made fresh and took up most of the plate. The best choice of the 4 of use. Will go back but maybe not for breakfast. Their crepes are popular."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars very easily to any establishment but I was so pleasantly surprised by Cafe Des Amis that there was no other rating that could do the meal I had proper justice! Tucked down a side street in the Village of Sewickley, Cafe Des Amis serves breakfast all day (LOVE having that option) but also has a lunch menu if you're so inclined. Parking can be tricky but meters are free in Sewickley Saturday and Sundays (in addition to holidays) so street parking, if available, is always an option. Also, the Sharp Edge Bistro parking lot is a short walk away if needed. My family, my boyfriend, and I visited Cafe Des Amis this past Saturday around 12pm for a brunch/lunch meeting. The inside has tables for both smaller and larger parties and we decided on a table near the window for the 5 of us. You order at the counter and pay first. You are handed a number and then your food is brought out to you when ready. They have bottled beverages (coke products, bottled water, pellegrino,etc) in a cooler in addition to the option of just tap water or fresh brewed iced tea. They run weekly specials, and this week one of the specials was ham,apple, and brie on a baguette served with one side. This is what my mom opted for, and while she said it was very good, she took half home and said she would add honey mustard to the sandwich when she ate the other half. My brother chose the roasted chicken and brie sandwich  (lettuce, honey mustard , and mayo on a toasted baguette) and, although I can't comment personally on it, he seemed to enjoy it. My dad chose the HAT wrap (hummus, avocado, turkey, lettuce, tomato on a warm tortilla) and he said it was very tasty. My boyfriend and I, having run the Pittsburgh 5K only a few hours earlier, decided to go with breakfast, each of us choosing an omelet. He chose the bacon and brie omelet while I went with the zucchini, basil, and goat cheese omelet. Each of the omelets, like the sandwiches, come with one side. I did not try my boyfriend's omelet but he said it was perfectly cooked and he enjoyed the complimenting flavors of the brie and bacon. Here is where the 5 star review comes in to play: The omelet I ordered was hands down THE BEST omelet I have ever eaten in a restaurant! Typically, I don't order omelets so I don't have much to compare this one too, however, my boyfriend, who orders omelets frequently for breakfast, agreed that it was absolutely amazing! It tasted so fresh and flavorful and was light and fluffy. Although it was quite a large portion, it was not heavy nor greasy and was quite easy to finish. The zucchini tasted fresh and was plentiful throughout the omelet, and I loved the creaminess the goat cheese provided for the dish. I had the fruit as my side and the melons were as sweet as can be-such a nice touch on the warm day we had this past Saturday! I raved about my omelet so much that my mother has requested we return this Sunday for Mother's Day so she can try one herself! I hope we do go back this Sunday as, even though I typically don't like to return to a restaurant so soon,  my my meal was just that good!"}
{"text":"Was somewhat disappointed after eating here despite my initial excitement to try this cute little place being advertised as a French Bistro. While the food I had was tasty I don't really think it is true french cuisine. You order at the counter and food is brought to your table. Prices are very reasonable as I ate for less than $10 per meal. Terrible street parking.   I've eaten both breakfast and lunch here. For breakfast, the Garden omelet was loaded with veggies and goat cheese, both of which I love. I chose a side of fruit which was sad and pathetic. It had clearly sat on the fridge after being prepared the night before. For lunch I had the Chicken Apple Walnut Salad which is usually served with her house dijon dressing. Since I'm not a fan of dijon dressing, I opted for balsamic dressing. The salad was served with a small cup of balsamic vinegar which was disappointing. The salad itself was huge and loaded with shredded chicken, dried cranberries and chopped apple.   Overall, the food here was good but again, not the french cuisine I was hoping for based on the name. While they do have french type paintings hanging, I am not sure this is enough to call this place a French Bistro. This is the basis for my 3 star rating. I would return here if in the area and looking for a healthy and quick meal, but this isn't one of those must try places."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. What a hidden gem.  My parents, husband and I loved it ! We will be back. From the breakfast to lunch you can't go wrong. We also had a chocolate tart for dessert which was amazing. Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place. Crepes and French treats are divine!"}
{"text":"I love this little cafe! I have had several different sandwiches & have tried their ham & cheddar quiche. The quiche is tasty, but a little too greasy on top for my liking. The caprese sandwich is also delicious: great mix of creamy cheese, crisp basil and juicy tomatoes. I think their baked apples are the best side: perfectly al dente & not soggy. The mac & cheese: good & not overly drenched in cheese. I think they're prices are a little above average but for the amount of food you get & the quality...right on point. A full quiche, plus 2 medium sides cost me $44 to take home. Definitely give this place a try over your big chain for breakfast & lunch!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Quiche tasted like it was made with instant egg. Crepes are cooked with pancake batter greased with spray on crisco. Side dishes is laughably small portion - and I don't eat much. Staff yells at you to place your order. Dirty silverware and you have to serve your own drinks and water etc despite paying over ten dollars for a crepe and some potatoes. On top of that they have the nerve to leave a line for a tip on the receipt.   Oh and when we went to sit in the side room it smelled like a latrine.  Mm yum.   I've been to France numerous times. This place is thousands of miles off of French food. Terrible and overpriced. Head to Oakland or east Liberty if you want a good French brunch."}
{"text":"Cafe des Amis is quietly placed in a small alley. There is a sign on from Broad st to show you where the cafe is but the alley is very small so i suggest you to park on the big street and walk to this place.   Staff is very nice and friendly. Food is delicious and big-enough portion for breakfast and brunch. The cheese in their food taste authentic, unlike plastic cheese flavor from other breakfast restaurants. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"FOUR STARS WITH A DISCLAIMER!  Despite fairly wretched service this little cafe serves such excellent pastries and freshly made crepes that I still gave it four stars.  The imperious Frenchman at the counter nearly sent me running for the door but I ignored his attitude and enjoyed my excellent cappucino and cinnamon crepe just the same.  What I didn't enjoy was his adding up our bill in his head. He rounded up, which might not seem like a big deal if it's only a few cents but that is not cool, not cool at all.  When you come demand a receipt but don't let it deter you from trying the fantastic buttery palmiers or apple tart."}
{"text":"Cozy cafe tucked down a side street in downtown Sewickly.  I said I was looking for something healthful, the chef worked off the menu to put together chicken salad on a bed of greens.  The chicken salad was made with cranberries, almonds, and homemade mayo.  Nice fresh greens.  Total bill was $10.60.  Service was friendly.  Chef checked back to get my thoughts.  Overall a great lunch."}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced. A small cup of fruit is $4. The food is not French, but Americanized French. The staff and owners are all Italian and seem to lack understanding of what true French cuisine is. To be fair though, the demographic of the area seems unconcerned by this, nor seems to know what real French food is. Staff is generally rude and seem irritable with guests. Biggest issue is that the server was the dish washer and had been made by the staff to serve food without drying off their hands. Atmosphere is cute but cramped, and the food prep area is loud and chaotic. Have to go up to the counter to order which is chaotic and adds an amateur vibe to the restaurant. They are also only open early morning to afternoon. Good luck finding parking for this place! Will not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Super quaint, family-friendly, French spot.  Friendly folks and good food.  Atmosphere is 5 stars, food was 4.5 stars as my chicken salad was little too mayo-y.  Good coffee too."}
{"text":"Decent food, ok prices, my brother said panera bread is better but I thought the soup and sandwich was good, chefs need to work on being friendly."}
{"text":"Everything is just so. The food is much better than anything you get in France.  I do like the open kitchens; watched one too many episode of Kitchen Nightmares. And the staff is just down to earth personable; just a very cool Sewickley's goto place."}
