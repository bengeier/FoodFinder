{"text":"I've only been here once and it was for Sunday brunch. The choices were eh, you could tell the cinnamon rolls were from Walmart, the French toast sticks were frozen, the potatoes were very bland, and fruit flies everywhere. The price is a little outrageous given the selection and that hardly any of it was home cooked. I gave 3 stars because the service was good, really good. Our usually Sunday spot is eat n park which has better buffet food and better pricing. Perhaps we'll come back for dinner some time."}
{"text":"A local establishment in downtown Irwin that has so great classic foods. Service is good too, very friendly staff with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  It isn't very fancy and doesn't appear to have been updated in the recent past, but they cook the food right in the open, which is awesome. 

My go-to dish here is \"It's a Beautiful Day,\" which consists of french toast and choice of bacon or sausage.  The french toast is always perfect, and reminds me of diner-style food.  I've never been disappointed with this choice.

This place gets VERY busy after church on Sundays, but is nearly empty on weeknights, when we prefer to go.  The staff is attentive, and I feel that most things on the menu are reasonably priced.  

This is truly one of the only family-owned breakfast restaurants in the Irwin area, and I would recommend to anyone who wants a tasty meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Went because Sunday brunch recommended. Don't bother you can buy prepared food and heat it yourself and it will be better. Total waste."}
{"text":"I visited the Colonial Grill and Taproom for the first and most likely the last time just this past Thursday with a few friends from work. I ordered their Colonial Grill Chicken which was actually very good! The chicken had a flavorful breading and the meat was very moist. We had a great meal and I was excited to go home and tell my husband about the place so we could go back sometime. However, the last 5 minutes we were there completely ruined it for me.

That staff was very rude and made us feel rushed out of the restaurant. The 40-something year old busboy shoved into me as he hurried over to clear our table when we had literally JUST stood up to leave. Not to mention the words \"excuse me\" were never uttered from his mouth. On top of that, the old woman at the front of the restaurant (who I'm hoping wasn't the owner) barked at me to \"Use the other door\" when we were trying to leave, without even glancing up from the counter. We never got a \"Have a good night\" or a \"Thanks for coming!\" 

I don't know if we came on a bad night or what. But I will not recommend the place to anyone. Its sad and disappointing that a few unmannered people can turn away 3 first time customers from ever wanting to return to their establishment."}
{"text":"Colonial Grille is very high quality. My family knows the owners and we love to eat there every morning! I really enjoy their breakfast and their hot chocolate! It's very affordable. And amazing service."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for breakfast, and it's not a terrible place.  The food is decent and the service is usually good as well.  I don't go out of my way to go here because it's nothing amazing, but it's definitely a good choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Go in, sit wherever you'd like, and a waiter will get to you. Have had quite a few items on their menu, and it has never been disappointing. Wonderful place to go with the family!"}
{"text":"Second visit after many years in the area.  The food is great.  They really know how to cook wings.  Again service was great. Really considering them for a catering event thi summer."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today.  The breakfast was pretty decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  One good thing was that there coffee was pretty okay.  At places like this I usually don't like the coffee but here I was pleasantly surprised.  The refills also came pretty fast.

If you like a lot of choice they certainly have it here.  After each person at our table ordered we were each asked between 4-5 questions to customize our order."}
{"text":"Had chicken parm sandwich and it is a steamed piece of chicken, no breading with sauce and cheese.  Asked for fries came w chips.  Ordered wings & they never came - was told they were given to another table. They took off a beer for my troubles but I wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"Good little place to grab breakfast.

Like their breakfast bowls, omelets, blt's and the buffet offers a large variety for about $12

I've only had lunch here once but prefer them for breakfast.

If you enjoy plain hash-browns (no onion, green peppers or spice) this is the place to order them, they come plain.

I love watching them cook on the flattop in front of me, they almost make it look like an art form.

If you are looking for a little quiet, I'd try the back bar area, which is very nice by the way."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant!  They have the best steak salads!  Their waffle is also very good!  They always are willing to fulfill special requests and their staff is super friendly!  A great cozy place in Irwin!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the nightlife and events held at the Colonial Grill and Taproom.  I love visiting small town neighborhood bars.  I love it even more when the bar is located in the very small town I grew up in.   I don't frequent it that often, but when I do, it sure feels like a mini-class reunion.  Always good to catch up with those you have known for more years than one cares to count.

My recent trip to the Taproom is one I hope to repeat over and over.  Thursday is Blues Night.  I had no idea what to expect, but the music and musicians were so vibrant, and engaging. It was almost impossible not to be drawn into the soul reaching energy they were expressing and exposing so powerfully.   The smooth connections these musicians have with one another is so beautifully displayed and performed.

If you love the blues, and appreciate fine talent, then clear your calendar for Thursday nights at the Taproom.  I know I certainly plan to do so.  Sorry my schedule didn't allow me to know about it sooner."}
{"text":"Great food and great people! Breakfast is always a winner here for me. Some of the best coffee!! Love the Sunday brunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I'm very happy we stumbled on this place. There are not many small diners around anymore - they've been put out of business by the chains. Colonial Grill still has the old charm with booths, lunch counter, and staff that cares. Plus the fry cook has skill with a potato. These aren't frozen mushy french fries. These are french fries the way they're meant to be. Hot, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I can't wait to check out breakfast."}
{"text":"Outstanding fried chicken, excellent fries, delicious mashed potatoes. Standard diner food done perfectly."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Great tap room with good beer specials and an excellent wait staff.  We have gone here several times and are always surprised at how much better the food is and how cheap the beer is compared to other local establishments. Better than lucci's and bellaluna for sure!  Seriously awesome wings and steak appetizer.  Lobster bisque I'd the best!  Always a good time never disappointed."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with years of experience.
We like to go there for brunch on Sundays and it is a great deal.  Price and quality area good! To take out our favorite is the breaded chicken, they  make them deli highly recommend this option. Overall is a good place and a traditional venue for this town"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast!  We love to sit at the counter and watch them work the grill; amazing. This is the best diner style restaurant in the extended area. We have never been disappointed with any breakfast or dinner entrees and their broasted chicken is fabulous. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Restaurant with a small bar in the back. Decent selction of bottle beer, not much on tap. The wings are delicious, good sized, falling off the bone, spicey. .50c on Wed. nights. Barmaid was friendly and helpful. The food I saw come out all looked good and decent portions."}
{"text":"Food is delicious...especially breakfast! My husband and I frequently go on the weekends for their breakfast special, which includes a croissant sandwich with cheese, eggs and ham (but I always sub the ham for bacon!) and either hash browns or homefries....greasy and so yummy, like breakfast should be! We can both eat and get a drink for under $14 easily. 

But unfortunately, there's too many downfalls. The place is in desperate need of a facelift. I know it's got that 'classic downtown Irwin\" feel and charm, but it's very outdated. Also, the service is slow. Sometimes I will stop in on my lunch break simply for an iced tea in the summer or hot chocolate when it's cold, and it takes forever for someone to get to you. Note: waitresses will not come over and assist. You need to wait for the hostess / cashier lady. Also, some waitresses are friendly, some are just uugggghhhhh so slow and kinda rude."}
{"text":"A quaint diner that sits on Main Street in Irwin.  I normally come here for breakfast or lunch with my dad on weekends.  The breakfast is always delicious!  I always get the eggs, toast, home fries and sausage.  They are consistent with the quality and yum.  Best coffee in the area and I love how it's served in old-fashioned mugs.

Lunch is also good.  I always get the grilled chicken wrap and I love it - it has roasted peppers and really kicks it up a notch in flavor.  French fries are standard.  I've only had dinner once here, it was a turkey dinner, and that was good too.   Nothing terribly remarkable but it was still tasty.

Service is always extremely friendly!  Sometimes it takes awhile for lunch, but the friendliness of the staff makes up for it.

There is also a bar in the back.  The bar area is dated-looking, but I haven't had a bad experience there either."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is off the hook and the prices VERY fair for the potions. The only issue is sometimes they are understaffed for the number of patrons, but overall the wait and the food makes it worthwhile. Do the trivia night, major good wings, the over all ambience is totally \"early southwestern PA\" and quite comfortable. The beer selections in the tap room are spot on and the prices of the same fair and reasonable. Go there it is a must! :) Oh and dont forget Sunday Brunch, starve yourself before going it'll make it even more unreal! :)"}
{"text":"Colonial grille is an Irwin staple. I've had breakfast lunch and dinner here on multiple occasions. Irwin has few places to dine unless you like fast food so choices are limited, thus I am almost forced to eat here. The service is sub par. I can count numerous occasions where I've waited for quite a long time to even get a beverage let alone order. I've walked out on one occasion since my wife and I were seated made a drink order then the server disappeared for almost a half hour. The bartenders are decent though, and their beer selection is good. The bar area is comfortable and appropriately lit. If you go here sit at the bar and order at least you will get served there.  All that said, they have the best fried chicken around hands down. They use a pressure fryer and cook it to order. The wings are huge and the sauces are good. The chicken is the only savior here."}
{"text":"This little diner tucked away on the main drag of downtown Irwin PA is a delight. Outstanding sandwiches, wings, appetizers and fried 'broasted' chicken TO DIE FOR! Breakfast served all day. I wish it was 10 miles closer. Good service, nice and clean."}
{"text":"Pretty bangin burger, had some great french toast. Total time warp deco, loved it. Deffi would hit this lil spot up again."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty big for breakfast, with a lot of different options. I ordered the \"Bank Tellers Omelet,\" with ham, mushrooms, and cheese (feta), and their homemade Italian toast, while my wife ordered poached eggs with raisin toast. We both also got a side of fruit.

The eggs were OK on both ends (the poached were a little buttery for some reason, and the omelet could have used more cheese). The biggest disappointment for us was the toast. The homemade Italian was really just white bread with the consistency of cardboard. I have a hard time believing it was actually homemade. 

The positives were that the coffee was very good, and the waitress even brought us our own carafe. She also brought us a side of sliced strawberries, as my wife didn't really like the mixed fruit.

We likely wouldn't go out of our way to visit Colonial Grille again. Not that the food was bad, it just didn't offer what we like most (good bread and good fruit)."}
{"text":"I love this place, simple food. Awesome breakfast and lunches and the Sunday brunch bar is so good. They have a nice bar area as well. There fried chicken is really good as well"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Irwin. Wings are double fried and the black and gold sauce is excellent. Good service and family atmosphere."}
