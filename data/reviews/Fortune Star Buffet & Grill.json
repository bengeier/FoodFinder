{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Lots of variety, friendly service, delicious food! Totally worth every dime! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there for a group get together & ate the buffet. There was a lot of different options and they were all tasty! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Jon H. Must not have gone to the same buffet that I went to. The food is fantastic! They have plenty of options to choose from including sushi, a make your own hibachi style grill, various types of chicken, shrimp, fish, and steak just to name a few! The service here is some of the best I've had from a buffet. My favorite part was the hibachi grill. You're able to choose from a variety of ingredients and they cook it right in front of you in seconds! The interior of restaurant is very classic while staying modern. I will absolutely be coming back for more visits! Don't just take my word on it, come try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"A lot of the food was cold still  but weight staff was good at refilling drinks and taking plates."}
{"text":"Best local Chinese buffet. But that's not saying much. Selection could be better.  Food could at least be warm at times. Decent price. Staff is tolerable. I can't stand when I walk in and they just give hand gestures for me to follow them and we get to the table and they say \"drink\" then that's all. I hate that.  General tsos is ALWAYS AWFUL. Which sucks because it's my favorite.. I've gotten sick after eating there twice. After the first time I thought it was just me catching a stomach bug. Nope. Not the case."}
{"text":"My kids and I like this buffet a lot.  I really like a lot of the options they have, and feel they are a step above most of the other regular Chinese buffets in the area.  The staff are always pretty friendly too, and keep our drinks filled and tables empty of used plates."}
{"text":"There was alot to choose from ,but most of the food looked.like it had been sitting for a while . Everything was cold not even warm. I had high hopes for this place but left disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up a couple weeks ago. Figured we'd give it a shot since a 10% discount was mentioned on facebook,   Since a buffet's most important trait is the food, and since this place is so new, we expected the food to be decent. Not really the case. There are a ton of options, but options alone aren't enough. The quality was average buffet fare at best.   They serve Chinese, Sushi, American, salads, and ice cream (scoop type). While a few of the foods were decent, overall most lacked flavor or were very bland.   To top it off, when we mentioned the 10% off discount, it wasn't honored. I don't see a reason to return here."}
{"text":"I was there eating on Saturday and the food was very delicious. The only problem I had was when I was leaving  (I'm disabled so I have to walk with a cane) , I do know if he was the manager or what. But the guy up front just stood there and watched me having trouble opening trouble door."}
{"text":"When Fortune Star first opened in Southland I reviewed it with 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the last several times we have been there we have noticed that the food is going downhill, most likely for cost cutting.  The General Tso Chicken is so tough you can barely chew it.  The seafood with cheese has been changed... and not for the better.  Many items on the buffet that my family eats regularly have been cheapened up.  Now there is a sign that there is a limit of one plate of crab legs.  It the crab legs were decent and not small, I could understand, but you need more than one plate to get anything decent.  We were regular customers here, but after the last experience and the past two with the crab legs notice, I am not sure if this location will be in our future of places to eat.  If we go back and it changes back for the better, I will review again.  But for now I would not go there."}
{"text":"Was the most terrible buffet we ever went to !  Didnt even want to pay the bill..Hitachi grill was disgusting"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. I have had better but it was edible. For the price I assume you can't beat it, but I would not eat there again there wasn't one thing I would crave from there. They rushed us out the door as well."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can eat Chinese buffets! I've had my fair share of Chinese buffets. This one is in the top rankings. I came on a Friday night and it was busy. All the food was coming and going. If something was running low, they would replace it. The hibachi was cooked all the way through as well. I had a few pieces of sushi and also liked them. Nothing I had was cold or could tell had been sitting out. I'm sure coming at a popular time helped with that as well. The servers were friendly and took away your empty plates fast. I will be back"}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean, basic buffet. I've gone several times, typically late lunch time. I tried dinner once, but it's basically the same but with soggy crab legs (if you're even able to find any past the crab hyenas) at twice the price. I've never seen too-old or too-cold food, except the soups sometimes seem a bit neglected. The sushi is pretty pathetic though, but one needs to temper ones expectations here. Overall there is nothing to get emotional about--it's a good value and wait staff decent enough. I can't imagine why anyone would give 5 stars unless this is the only restaurant they ever ate in, but nor is there really any reason to complain."}
{"text":"Everthing is tasty except Sushi. The price of $7.95 weekdays cant beat. Great cost performance."}
{"text":"Couldn't complain. Food was decent, environment was clean, good service. Not my 1st choice in the area but I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Chinese buffet (and very similar to the one in monroeville).  The main dining room has both booths and tables and there is a side room as well.  The side room seems to be where they exiled many families with children (although there were a few in the main dining room as well). The buffet had a variety of islands of food.  One was salads/cold food, one dessert, several with hot food items and one with soups.  There is a separate area that has a hibachi station and sushi. We went at an off peak hour (around 2:30) so I was worried about food freshness, but everything was pretty fresh and seemed to be replenished pretty regularly. The main buffet has the standard options.  Chicken with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, general tsao chicken and more.  There were also items like coconut shrimp, spicy chicken and others.  Sides included the typical Lomein noodles and white and fried rice.  There was also \"seafood\" stuffed mushrooms and clams, cream cheese puffs and crab Rangoon among others. Four varieties of soup were available (although they were not getting attention and being replenished). It was mostly clean and the food decently fresh.  The service wasn't the greatest, but we were in the side room so we may have been an after thought. They do have changing tables in the men's bathroom which isn't a common occurrence so that is a plus. Overall not a bad place, especially for the weekday prices."}
{"text":"Complete waste of time, effort, and money! Food was \"fresh\" but very bland taste. Crappy takeout from a hold in the wall probably would taste better ! Bad service, waitress had plenty of attitude problems and owner yelled across the room her dinner table for someone to come to the register to ring us up. Never again!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and dinner... I had steak and the best fried rice I have ever had tonight.  The staff are wonderful and very good.  The pepper steak was so tender...  All and all a great buffet!"}
{"text":"I ate there recently and the food was not up to par. When we were leaving the owner who was at the register asked how the food was and when i replied not up to par he said....Thank you.go figure"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, but this place was just not good.  Let me start by saying the wait staff and hostess were VERY nice. The atmosphere was also nice. They are the reason I feel bad leaving a poor review.  The food was just the worst quality. Some cold, and some just not edible. The General tso's was ok, but that was about it. They did have a lot of options, don't get me wrong. However, none of them were good. I actually felt disappointed in myself after consuming this food.  My dad and I went because he had a 25% off coupon. The bill was still $19. They do not serve alcohol, so that was for the buffet and no drinks.  Last but not least, provide some guidance for the hibachi grill. That is what I wanted to eat, but I had NO clue how to go about getting it."}
{"text":"We really needed this in the area. I had to settle for Giant Eagle sushi for a while. I like it much better than the Buffett that was there before. They did a beautiful job with the renovation. The prices are very reasonable. The food choices are plentiful. I love their honey chicken. The sushi selection could be bigger, but they always have what I eat. I am just so thrilled that this place opened"}
{"text":"Rarely if ever do I leave a bad review. However, since my mother failed to warn me, I felt compelled to warn others of this horrible experience. Sparing them the agony that I endured.  Perhaps it sounds a bit much when describing an experience at a buffet. I mean, come on, this is a buffet. How good could be. How bad could it be? Better thank this.  Anyone, who believes this is the best buffet on the face of the earth, hasn't been to the Grand China Buffet in Bridgeville. Not that the food at Bridgeville is especially amazing, but the Hibachi there is worth the price of the buffet. (A dollar cheaper per adult and they charge .60 per year on a kid.)  To me, any buffet with the hibachi grill, is worth it. If the hibachi grill is good. Unless you go to Fortune Star. The food is greasy and taste like a dirty grill. The man who cooked it, looked like he wanted to spit in my food, as if he was thinking, 'why do I have to cook for you.'. He was unpleasant and unkempt.   The most positive thing I can say about this place is the wait staff, they were pleasant enough. They didn't go out of their way but they still were pleasant. Unlike Hibachi man.  There wasn't much to choose from. Eight stations. One for ice cream, dessert, salad bar, cold food, appetizers, American food, hot food entrées and one for hibachi toppings. That's it. Nothing stood out. Absolutely nothing was outstanding.  It wasn't even average. It was below average. And it would've been semi tolerable had when I received the bill not have nearly fallen out of the booth. Even with 10% off, I wanted to die. Now, I am not cheap when it comes to buying a meal. I'll go to Bonefish. If the food is good. I will gladly pay for it. But this was not worth $12 an adult, seven dollars a child, and 2.50 a beverage. And... tea is not free! Back up, just for a six year old, seven year old with two sodas, $19.00! Are you kidding me? That much for just two kids. That was their portion.   It pained me, absolutely pained me to pay that bill. The kids barely ate. They gagged.   To top it off, I nearly broke a hip and fell when they failed to put signs up on the soaking wet freshly mopped floor.  The hostess did yell out a warning after I crossed the linoleum of death. Yeah, thanks, I wish you warned me BEFORE I ate.  All the way home with a knot in my stomach I kept thinking, \"all that money I just spent for me, my daughter and the two kids, I could've gone to many different places.\"   Granted, $45 is not the end of the world, for less, I could've gotten a halfway decent meal at Eat and Park, For the same amount, I could have gone to Applebee's and got a cocktail, or saved $15 by taking a ride to the Bridgeville buffet and left satisfied.  Being a good daughter I decided to call my mother on the way home, warning her not to go there, and her response was, \"Oh, that place. Worst place on the face the earth don't go there.\" \"Ug, why didn't you tell me?\" \"I just did.\"  If you are thinking of cashing in that coupon and going to Fortune Star, do yourself a favor ... don't. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, the first being just as the restaurant opened.  This visit was better.  I compare this location to its sister restaurant of the same name in Monroeville.  The Monroeville facility is brighter and larger and it offers a dish that is important to me: mixed vegetables with tofu: no tofu at the Pleasant Hills location.  The array of foods that I received for a mere $7.71 with coupon for Saturday lunch is extraordinary, and it included fresh strawberries and pineapple, both ready to eat.  I particularly enjoyed egg foo young, rice noodles with chunks of egg, and baked chicken: succulent.  Some of the foods, like the lo mein noodles, are greasy.  This is not the best Chinese food, but it is good and the value is A+."}
{"text":"I like this place more that the old one that was here before it. I like the way it was remodeled, and even the bathrooms are gorgeous. The food is pretty good, consisting of what you'd expect at a typical Chinese buffet. A mixture of Chinese and American food, with a salad bar, a good selection of fruits, deserts, and even ice cream (scoop kind, not soft serve). They have crab legs for dinner (sometimes out until they can get them back on the buffet on crowded weekend evenings), and eat as much as you want with no extra charges. They also have a hibachi and sushi bar for no extra charge! The owners are always very friendly and know our family every time we go in and greet us kindly. The staff is also very attentive and friendly. I can't really complain for the price. While it's not the highest quality food, it's definitely not bad and the price is just right in my opinion. You can also get take out and it's priced by weight I believe, could be wrong. Personally is worth it. I'm a regular here, never have any complaints!"}
