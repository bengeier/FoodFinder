{"text":"Always consistent and quick Chinese food. Great for our date night in! Steamed dumplings and the crab Rangoon are definitely musts on the appetizer menu!"}
{"text":"We eat here every once and a great while and while the food is edible, I've had better.  But what prompted me to write a review is my experience last night.  I recently went vegan and ordered the bean curd szechuan style.  What I got wasn't bean curd (or regular tofu) but silken tofu instead (which is great for blending in smoothies or as an egg replacement in baked goods, but kind of tastes like snot on its own).  Eww.  It came with peas and carrots (most likely a frozen mix since the carrots were so consistent) and a ton of sauce.  Not to mention we waited close to 90 minutes for delivery at 7pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese takeout in Madison. I love the Kung bao chicken and always get it extra spicy. It gives it just enough extra kick to make it really delicious. You can also ask for the spicy sauce on the side. We live closer to a different Chang Jiang but this one is the only one we will order from. And it's always ready in 10 minutes!!"}
{"text":"Im in town 8 times a year for the past 4 years. I've eaten at all the Chang jiang in Madison area..   The food is absolutely amazing, tasty and addictive.  Their brown sauce taste very unique in a good way different than any other Chinese cuisine I've been.  They are a carry out place, wish they had an actual dine in area.   Forget all those other Chinese fancy dine in place.   Chang jiang tops them all."}
{"text":"This place used to be really really bad, but it must have changed managers because the food has improved dramatically. We order from them a couple times a month because they're the only Chinese restaurant that delivers to our house."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time, after hearing great reviews. I love the fact that they advertise that they cook with vegetable oil - so you know what you're eating.   However, we placed a small order for two over the phone, and somehow half the order was incorrect - they gave us entirely different dishes! I was very disappointed, to say the least, and most likely will not be returning. I'm not sure if there was a language barrier, but attention to detail would have been nice."}
{"text":"I had a crave for chinese food today and after reading good reviews about this location I went ahead and placed an order.  I had the combination plate C26 (General Tso Chicken) since some yelpers raved about this dish and to be honest, I liked the sauce but I didn't like it had so much breading I could not even taste the chicken inside (if there was any). The accompaniments were a pork fried rice (that was tasty) and a pork egg roll (same as  most other chinese places) very chewy and a bland flavor. My hubby had the #66 (Kung Bo chicken) and he said there wasn't anything exciting about it. I really don't know if we will order again from this place."}
{"text":"As far as your Americanized Chinese food goes (by that I mean the neon colored fried meat and rice coated in sweet sauce), this hits the spot. At lunch the specials are incredibly cheap and contain very generous portions for what they charge. Meats are pretty good-- they don't contain any giant gristle pieces or raw bits, instead they seem to use pretty good quality meat and the sauces are very tasty. Not quite authentic, but for Chinese takeout food, this may be my favorite in Madison."}
{"text":"I gave it a star because I \"had\" to in order to review.  I ordered a small chicken fried rice to go for my lunch and when I got there the guy at the cash register was on his phone, didn't noticed me until the chef told him. He had such a hostile voice because I \"interrupted\" his phone call and said \"fried rice!? 5 dollar\". And after swiping my card he just turned away and continue yapping on his phone. Not even a \"thank you\". Not to mention that the fried rice was so damn plain! Not a single carrot, onion or green onion. Just plain rice and chicken and barely a hint of salt or soy sauce. Oh, and he didn't even give me a spoon or fork in the bag! Yea, not going there anymore. Poor service and food was below par."}
{"text":"Hands down the #1 Chinese takeout in the city.  Although each location has its own menu everything I have had is great! They have lunch and dinner combos that are very reasonable and include rice and an egg roll.    My favorite is the sesame chicken special but they have great tofu options of you're into that.  They say 15 minutes for pick regardless of the day or time but usually have it ready is just over 10.  Anything off the full dinner menu could easily be split by two or be saved for leftovers.  Or if you are a big guy like me or just downright hungry, you could easily power through the whole thing.  I'm actually getting hungry for it again just writing this."}
{"text":"The veggie fried rice is tasty but the orange chicken wasn't nice and chewy. It was hard and crusty. We ate in and my mom asked for a plate, the lady behind the counter have her a styrofoam plate instead of a nice glass one. All the silverware were plastic and it wasn't nice at all to eat it. We ordered over the phone and that lady couldn't understand our order even just the simple name she struggled with. It was exhausting. when we finally got our order in she didn't even ask for our name or number. I would only go back for the fried rice. Overall not a nice place."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad. It is your typical Chinese food restaurant, and it's food hasn't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"I love this place, so does the hubster and kiddos. Great location, friendly atmosphere. Always clean and the food always hot and fresh. The kiddos usually share sweet and sour chicken. They hubbies and I always get the general taos chicken and egg drop soup."}
{"text":"This place suffers the same infliction as so many other american/chinese restaurants (by this I mean the EXACT SAME MENU as every other place! really kind of funny. It's like they have a big conference every so often and unanimously decide to create the same dishes... that or perhaps they are all under control by the Chinese Mafia! Oh my I may have just stumbled about the greatest secret in this century... ok maybe not... enough joking, back to the review.).  With that said, the folks here do an excellent job and are nice people.   My favorite is the dragon and phoenix (a mix of garlic shrimp and general tao's chicken with various vegetables) and I normally order wonton soup (the broth has turned out very watery sometimes but that hasn't been typical) and my wife goes for the sesame chicken and singapore noodle dish (I think that is the name but it doesn't appear on the online menu. It is a noodle dish with a yellow curry sauce with shrimp, chicken (and pork too perhaps) and variety of veggies.   Keep in mind that like most of these type of restaurants it is more family style so sharing is nice. The place is not sit down, just a take out.  I have to get this off my chest, I don't like their lo mein (veggie, combo, etc.). The flavor just seems off to me.  Finally, this Chang Jiang is the BEST one. I tried another one and it did not have the same quality as the Meadowood location."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and fast. The food is always delicious and served in generous portion sizes. As good as it gets for take out Chinese."}
{"text":"The staples are good (general Tso's, crab Rangoon).  Good for a once-a-month treat.  It's close to home so I go here.  Never had a bad experience.  Pickup orders are ready in 10 minutes, can't beat that."}
{"text":"If you want pounds and pounds of generic asian take-out, this place is awesome.  This being said, we got two dishes, egg rolls, a spring roll, and rangoon.  The General's chicken was no joke, the best I've ever had. Phenomenal. Solid 4.5 stuff alone.  The steak with orange was on the other extreme however. It had a funky texture and while it smelled great, it lacked any real quality other than being mush. I hate wasting food, but it quickly ended up in the trashcan and was inedible.  The egg rolls and spring roll were dull, which is pretty standard all around.  The rangoon had a lot in them, but were very sweet, far more so than I expected.  This place does deliver though, which is a huge plus, though be careful what you order, as it's very hit-or-miss.  Then again, you get what you pay for, and it's exactly what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Absolutely solid Chinese takeout. Generous portions, and friendly counter service. This location is no-frills, so don't expect to dine in."}
{"text":"I miss this place so much! We moved about 15 miles away, but I still have their number in my favorites because I will order when in the neighborhood. There is no dining area, this is carry-out only. I have rarely had a mistake or bad order in over 6 years of getting food here pretty regularly. Don't be put off by the somewhat rushed phone manners of staff when ordering- the food is good! I love the Gen. Tso's chicken, kung bao chicken and garlic shrimp. The mushroom egg foo young is delish also. Their crab wontons are good, but the shrimp toast is the best- always puffy and yummy. I am so hungry now just thinking about it. I may have to go for a drive..."}
{"text":"I can't wait until we get back to Chicago! So, this place was recommended by one our friends that live here so we thought we'll give it a try. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken.... why is there only ONE PIECE OF PINEAPPLE in what is suppose to be SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE! At least when I go to other Chinese restaurants in Chicago, I get red peppers, onions, and MORE PINEAPPLES! The sauce was pretty good as well as the chicken. My husband enjoyed his food which was good. Wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice. We'll have to find another Chinese place when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Order from them all the time - always good food! Sometimes they are super busy and it takes a bit for delivery but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Typical take out chinese food. I try to order something different every time; because there's so much to choose from. I've been here four times. They've all been consitantly good every time. I like the house soup; it has all the veggies and meats. It's also has a light and clean taste. My fav. Is the chow mei fun pork. It's the best here. I Also got a courtesy 2 liter soda from my thirty four dollar order which is nice. They also place cut out cardboard for your take out thats helps out alot. I like this place so far and I'll keep coming back to order something different every time."}
{"text":"For American style Chinese, you can't get a much better value than this. Very solid takeout with humongous portions. I recommend the fried dumplings in particular. Very thick and  nice."}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice was really bland, lacked chicken, and mostly consisted of rice. The Mongolian beef was also mostly onions and lettuce."}
{"text":"I probably eat from here once a week. The portions of the lunch dishes last me two meals. I spend under $5 for the lunch specials.  This is takeout only. Call ahead and order or else you'll wait 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant in Madison no matter which side of town I'm on. Great food and service, affordable prices- What more could you ask for?! 5/5"}
{"text":"It's a Chinese American take out/delivery place. It's pretty much standard Americanized food, so, if you go in with that mindset, you'll be satisfied. I always get the mu shu with tofu, and yep; it's just as good as other \"Chinese\" joints. I would love a truly authentic Chinese restaurant in my area, but this place fulfills my lazy Sunday Chinese food cravings every time, and their egg drop soup is great when you have a sore throat."}
{"text":"Love the mu shu!"}
{"text":"This was pure nightmare fuel. A garbage fire. The stuff that keeps me awake at night. Probably the worst service I've ever had in my life. Bold statement I know but hear me out. I ordered their food for lunch and upon calling the man who picked up had zero business being in customer service. He picked and immediately said \"what do you want?\" In a very extremely rude tone. He then was extremely short with me for absolutely no reason and hung up on me before I could give him my credit card info. Called back. No answer... huh? At this point I couldn't believe what I was seeing. So an HOUR AND HALF later I finally received my food and guess who delivered it? Oddly enough the same guy who answered the phone. As soon as I heard his voice I couldn't help but laugh. Politely explained to him that he hung up before I could give him my card info and that I tried calling and all he said was \"your total is $13.57!\" Very rudely.... huh? That was strike two. So after this nightmare, I decided to not tip him because of the horrendous service. Maybe wrong on my end but this guy was absolutely vile and that's an understatement. So luckily I had cash. Gave him cash and he looked at it and said \"no tip huh?!\" And I looked at him and said \"nope\". But as I shut the door I heard an unquestionable \"fuck you\"... huh? What was scary was there was no question or a shadow of a doubt. He definitely said it and I couldn't believe what a joke this place was. But through it all I have to give a big thank you to this place. Not for the shit service or the hour and half wait, but to make me realize that there is a reason yelp exists. Overall, this is number one on my list for worst places I've ever been and if we're being frank here, I'd rather have my body pulled through broken glass than go here again. So In the words of the man who answered the phone and delivered the food... \"fuck you\"."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but both my fiancé and I got sick about 2 hours after eating it, pretty sure it was food poisoning. The yelp online ordering was fast and easy, and delivered earlier than scheduled.   Probably won't order from here again,"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 items for my husband and myself over the phone. They didn't take his name or phone number etc. When he arrived 15 mins later the food wasn't ready, our order was no where to be found (shocker).   The food was ok I guess.  We've decided to find another place to go instead."}
{"text":"Eminently edible. Nothing special or authentic, but then, what were you expecting, really? Hey, are you hungry? Could you eat Americanized Chinese food that's better than Panda Express? You could? Then ready yourself for Chang Jiang!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Chiang Jiang on Raymond Road I always get two orders of fried dumpling. Their dumpling sauce is not bad but it doesn't have the smokey flavor of Flaming Wok. I've been to most of the Chinese take-out restaurants in Madison but some how I just keep coming back to Chiang Jiang. I recommend the fried dumplings, Dragon & Phoenix, and Pork Roast Egg Foo Young. The only time I saw inconsistency in their dumpling was because it looked like a younger chef made them. Usually when the older chef makes the food it is pretty damn good. Most of their food is pretty good, wish I could try everything on the menu.  Believe me, the skill of the chef makes the most difference."}
{"text":"Last time I went to this place and order something. it order was wrong, I ordered boneless ribs and got fat mostly, the lady that is usually there was not there. and a tall lady was bickering with another male employee the whole time doing the order. I also order chicken with something and got beef.  I don't get the beef there cause its too salty.  ordered chicken egg roll and got veggie.  when going back home the boneless ribs spilled out all in the bag so did another box, neither lids were on fully. I'M NEVER GOING BACK THERE WHEN THAT CERTAIN LADY IS WORKING THERE.  I HAVE BEEN GOING TO ANOTHER ORDER OUT PLACE ON MCKENNA BLVD."}
{"text":"It's mediocre at best.   Service is very disappointing, the person made me stand there while he yelled at people in the other room in another language then started at me while I repeated, I need a pen to sign.     Get home to an order that is hot and ok tasting but honestly it looked nothing like the pictures of the food.  If the order doesn't look or consist of the same ingredients, the pictures are simply misleading."}
{"text":"I go here often,  My family has diverse taste and we can usually accommodate everyone without any issues,  Vegetarian's are happy, combo meals are great - the eggrolls though large are extremely tasty. The sweet and sour chicken are one of my favorites. Its an inexpensive go to spot that does not disappoint."}
{"text":"We ordered the Szechuan chicken, beef with garlic sauce and the beef lo neon. The expected time was 45 minutes, but they got there in 20! The food was nice and hot. The Szechuan chicken and beef with garlic sauce were pretty good, but oh man that beef lo mein was delicious! We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"If I could give this ZERO stars I would....  he rushed me and was VERY rude. I had questions on what ingredients were in some of their items since it was my first time ordering from them and different chinese restaurants make the same dishes different ways. He was EXTREMELY rude and I asked if I could talk to someone else and he said \"there is no one else okay sorry what you want\" I said \"iv been trying to order for the last 15 mins. you know what nevermind ill go to the one on gammon\" he then hung up on me..."}
{"text":"I've been going here for several years.  Its a great family owned place with a diverse and wonderful menu.  its always high quality, and I just love everything about it.  There aren't any tables so its takeout only.  So far its my favorite in Madison east or west."}
{"text":"Basic Chinese delivery.... Have had better but in Madison I have had much much worse!!"}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered quite the smorgasbord & I wasn't delighted with anything. My veggie roll was large but not very tasteful, same goes for my boyfriend's shrimp roll. The Crab Rangoon was lacking in any filling- I felt like I was biting into deep fried air! Our veggie moo shu was boring & had no egg in it? The wraps for the moo shu made me feel like I was eating paper. The bf ordered General Tso's chicken & said it was decent. I wouldn't order from this place again unless I had no other choices..."}
{"text":"Only been once, don't plan to go back.  I had the daily special, which was mushroom pork, and my wife had one of the tofu dishes.  The pork was just bad.  I know it's a strip mall Chinese restaurant, but the quality of the pork itself was poor, and it was really overcooked.  It had an uncomfortable gray color to the whole thing.    I will say that the fried rice that came with my meal was good, but not good enough to warrant a trip back.    I'm not usually one to blacklist a restaurant after one trip, but with all of the other takeout Chinese options available, I don't see a reason to give this another try."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the best Chinese take out in Madison! I'm a pretty tough critic as far as Chinese take out goes, so I'm glad to have finally found a place in town that I'm willing to eat at.   Big note here. They close before Yelp or Google lists. They're part of a chain of similar named restaurants, but they run themselves and function differently. The food is better than the other locations and the hours are shorter. I tried to submit a time change, but Yelp hasn't responded. I believe it was an hour and half earlier for  closing time than what is listed. Either way, I suggest calling to double check.  I went under the impression that they were open. Turns out they hadn't shut the lights off, locked the doors, or anything else, but had cleaned and broken everything down. We went in to order and they didn't mention being closed. My boyfriend and I  had a feeling what was going on so we asked. They said they had closed, but they were more than willing to make our food. We tried insisting that we could go elsewhere and it would be absolutely no problem, but they insisted back. So we ordered. 10 minutes later and we had steaming hot, delicious smelling food and the entire staff jumped into their cars.   Thanks guys! You definitely have my business!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Chinese takeout places!   I have moved away from Madison and still crave the food.  My sister and I would eat there at least once a week and every time I come home I make it a point to stop here.  I recommend the vegetarian broccoli dish and my sister is obsessed with General Tso's Chicken. I also love hot Jasmine tea they have for you while you wait.  Perfect to cut through the crisp (emphasis) Wisconsin air. ;)  If you are looking for a great takeout place look no further!"}
{"text":"Best American style Chinese food in Madison. As a New Yorker I know good Chinese food and this is it. I haven't found a place that has the flavor, style and consistency of this place. Love the rice, ribs and egg rolls. Nothing to write home about visually but that's what these kind of fast food Chinese joints should look like."}
{"text":"Holy inconsistencies, Batman. I had tried Chang Jiang a couple years ago, and was not at all pleased. A couple weeks ago, my brother convinced me to order from CJ. I tried the sesame chicken, and it was delicious. The downside: it took almost two hours to arrive. They had forgotten our order, and only realized it after we called them back after 90 minutes. Apparently their other location was closed for the night, so they were handling all orders out of one restaurant. Unfortunate, but since it was so tasty and a weird circumstance, I overlooked it.  Tonight, Christmas Eve, I decided to give them another go. They have a $15 minimum delivery, so I ordered two entrees figuring it'd make me plenty of tasty meals over the holiday weekend when nothing else is open. I ordered the sesame chicken again, and an order of lemon chicken. The food arrived in 30 minutes, but unfortunately it was...  Barf city.   While the sesame chicken last time consisted of tasty chunks of white meat that kept their crispy coating despite soaking in sauce, this time it was especially fatty dark meat that was hard to cut and had a very displeasing mouth feel. I had expected the lemon chicken to be similar to the sesame chicken or sweet and sour chicken - battered chunks with a gooey sauce. Instead it was a chicken breast pounded flat and breaded with crumbs. The sauce was served on the side, and that's a good thing: it was so lemony and watery it seemed fake. It felt more like I was adding a dose of Lysol to my meal than a burst of citrus goodness. The chicken itself was okay, but really was no better than a cheap patty and not at all what I think of when considering Chinese takeout.   If I knew I'd be getting the same delicious batch of food I got a couple weeks ago, I'd go back to Chang Jiang for sure. However, tonight's failure ($22 with tax and tip down the drain - hopefully I can get someone to eat the leftovers so it's not a total waste) will probably prevent me from ordering there again."}
{"text":"Nothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona."}
{"text":"The menu is good, a bit more of the authentic stuff than you see elsewhere. Dim Sum and buns for example. The food is tasty, and sometimes significantly different from what other places will give you under the same name.   The kitchen is the filthiest I've ever seen. If you sit and wait for your order at the innermost booth, the one by the cash register, you get a good view of some of the food prep areas. When I was there, I saw a deli meat slicer sitting on a counter with old meat splatter all over the walls behind it, looking as though they were cast off from the spinning blade and left to rot. Walls and floor all over were similarly covered in old food splatter."}
{"text":"Overall a decent chinese restaurant. Service is quick and always ready in 10-15 minutes. One caveat to all of this is: AVOID THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. It is a total let down. As an alternative may I suggest the Hunan chicken (not as spicy as you'd think), the General Tso's (also not as spicy, but spicy enough for me), or the Crab Rangoon (don't even think about reheating them - they must be consumed in one sitting).   One more thing to avoid - the low mein. It's a bit flavorless and limp. I keep trying it, hoping I just got a bad batch, but no such luck."}
{"text":"Just meh. Not sure how this place is rated so highly. It's your run of the mill strip mall joint. Not that it is particularly bad just nothing worth writing home about. They aren't too friendly but your food is usually done quick. No delivery though :("}
{"text":"Whenever I want great carry out this is where I go. Highly recommended. The food is always prepared fresh and have never had a bad meal. Located a little out of the way the extra turns are always well worth it. I love their crab rangoons and the chow mei fun is a great alternative to fried rice."}
{"text":"Call in your order ahead of time if you don't want to wait. For take-out, they certainly take their sweet time.   I had no issues with the kung pao chicken I ordered. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the vegetable ingredients (green bell peppers and celery), and I liked that the chicken was finely diced. I didn't mind the overload of peanuts either.   They are a little pricey for a mediocre take-out restaurant. For the quantity and quality of the food, I was appalled to find that an order of kung pao and general tso's came out to be $16.  Plus, the food is about as Americanized as you can get. Thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Chinese food is different everywhere. Not impressed. I wasted my money. What's fried rice with no peas and carrots. I ended up with rice and shrimp. Dumplings looked like steamed buns! Everything ended up in the waste basket."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for fast, delicious Chinese take-out, this is the place for you. I recommend picking up your food over delivery, though I've never run into issues with delivery.   I've had the vegetable fried rice, sesame chicken, lo mein, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, hot and sour soup. Everything is truly delicious and comforting to fulfill a Chinese take out craving.   This is the best Chinese takeout in Madison."}
{"text":"Average american Chinese food. Like most of the other restaurants with similar names in the Madison area."}
