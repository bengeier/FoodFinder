{"text":"Hero's, a local sports bar, appealed to me after I was informed they have NTN's Buzztime, a local network video poker application, by my mother. I used to enjoy playing Buzztime at Damon's Grill, who previously offered this service, but went out of business some time ago.   I had decided to take my mother, her being a frequent poker player as well, on a Sunday evening at around six. Upon entering, the hostess greeted us from behind her pedestal. We informed her that we would like a high top and, being not relatively empty at the time, she allowed us to seat ourselves as she followed shortly behind.    After being seated she handed us our menu's and told us she would be right back with our drink orders. As she left I skimmed the menu and immediately knew exactly what I wanted: The Philly Steak Hero for $8.99. About a minute later she came back took both our food and drink orders.  When she left once again my mother and I logged into Buzztime and played poker with each other until our food came out, roughly five minutes later. I was very impressed with the speed of the service; however the quickness could have been due to the time we went.   The Philly Steak Hero was served with thinly sliced sirloin, grilled mushrooms, and white American cheese on a sub roll approximately three fourths the size of a subway foot long. The onion rings could have been more plentiful to justify the size of the sandwich a bit, but in my mind the service and atmosphere made up for it. The onion rings were also delicious nonetheless. The sandwich had a bit of steam radiating off the steak, thoroughly melting the cheese. The bread could have been a bit warmer, but I wasn't expecting a flawless sandwich from a sports bar. Overall the meal was on par with my expectations.  Regardless of the slightly undersized meal, the poker, service, and atmosphere made for a great time. If you're in the area I would definitely recommended you drop in for a meal sometime, especially if you enjoy poker as much as I do."}
{"text":"This is a below average sports bar.  TV's and decor are pretty dated, and prices are higher than the atmosphere would suggest are warranted, although it is in a nice area.  I wish Zipps would move in across the street so I would have a good place to watch the games."}
{"text":"This place was awkward. We came in with a group of 10 for beers and wings after softball. The hostess seemed perplexed on what to do with so many people. She greeted us then turned and disappeared and left us standing at the door for about 10 minutes, despite this place being almost empty. We weren't sure if we were getting a table or what. The waiter was not excited about a group (understandably) but he made it obvious. The wings were average, and their blue cheese tasted like and had the consistency of milk. The wings were expensive too, i think it came to $14 for a dozen wings and a soda. The inside is carpeted, which was a poor  idea seeing as it's now covered in mystery stains."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Burgers are pretty tasty and they have HopKnot on tap.  Good place to catch a game with friendly strangers."}
{"text":"Best wings in Mesa great beer selection. Trick is to order the wings grilled with side of extra sauce. Awesome. Good selection of TVs and friendly wait staff. Owners are often working the floor too and makes for a great local, friendly spot for Sports and dinner or just a cold beer. It isn't the cheapest place in town, but in line for what you get."}
