{"text":"No story is needed here. Service is bad. The chicken is dry out. No lunch sets   Order 2 meals and 1 didn't come after at least 30mins. And waitress didn't follow up even we ask her to check. And we ask for bill and they didn't cancel the one which never arrived until we said how can u charge us...."}
{"text":"They gave me supposedly dry instant noodle stirfry but was soaked in soup and said, \"that's the way we make it.\" I'll never ever go back."}
{"text":"We saw the banner right outside the day before and the \"macaroni with Russian borsch\" picture really caught our eyes.  As an American New Yorker native, I've never thought something like this would be good for breakfast but the picture looks really good.   Thats what we ended up ordering for breakfast.  I think the order number is 2206?  It was a combination with a white toast with butter, macoroni with Russian borsch and Hong Kong style tea with milk.  Definitely not healthy hahaha but I don't care since I am fit.  It was heavy and  the taste was rich and hearty.  I don't think I need to have lunch anymore.  The macaroni was as good as I thought and it has some beef stew inside.  Howver, my favorite is the HK tea with milk.  My boyfirend has been telling me about it.  I love it.  The aroma and rich taste and thickness was way better than coffee.  FYI, I did not add any sugar.   Finally, service was unattentive, in another word not much of any service at all.  Well, at least they were not rude but definitely not professional and personable.    Food 4 stars and service 2 stars.  Conclusion 3 stars."}
{"text":"Service is no good as expected for a fast food type of HK style restaurant.    The best part is the soup comes with the lunch meal.  The black pepper beef noodle is below average.  I never expect it to be good but just to fill up my stomach for a quick lunch.  At the end I like to order a toast but was told that it will not be offered till the afternoon tea time.  Place for a quick lunch with no expectation !"}
{"text":"As an asian that usually eats asian, every asian place starts tasting the same after a while. This place is no different, although I felt the dishes had too much MSG and the drinks were a little chemically-made (doesn't taste natural). Price points for all dishes are good however.  The deep fried milk custard tastes like a block of melted butter, I feel so icky and fat eating it. The baked pork chop rice had tomato sauce that was a bit too sour and saucey. There was a rice with ribs; the ribs were covered with some sort of MSG flavoring that was overpowering.  A sip of the lemon green tea delivers a powerful lemon flavor then finishes off with a slight green tea flavor, but the lemon was a bit strong. It's alright though.   There are some good authentic dishes it seemed and a good amount of combos. If you live around the area, try it and see if you like it. But just be warned about the excessive MSG, especially if you are allergic."}
{"text":"You are better off cooking at home rather than coming here!.  I ordered fried rice.. Doesn't even taste like fried rice. I also ordered instant noodles with chicken which was extremely salty... Plus the soup that it comes with is either TOO salty Or plain that taste like nothing."}
{"text":"I came to this place for lunch and had the stone pot noodle as I have had it before and it was excellent. However, this time it came swimming in a big bowl of water and when I asked the server about it she claimed it was 'soup' and it was normal. I felt like the servers had really bad attitude as she didn't even offer to fix it (could've been done by simply pouring the 'soup' out) and walked away before I could say anything more.   Later I pointed this out to another server thinking that I would get more help from a different server and the result was very much the same. She claimed that there is ALWAYS soup in the stone pot noodle even though I have eaten it many times before and clearly remember its only suppose to have minimal amounts of sauce.   Needless to say I am never going back to this place and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"It's A-OK.  Small, dark-ish and rounded like a subway tunnel in decor (ah-ha!  I get it!  Station Asia!)  For the extra $2 or so, I think it's well worth it to make your entree a combo with an extra drink and appetizer.  It's the appetizer that's well worth it - not much to look at, but that shredded fatty chicken and pickled turnip pack an intense flavour punch!  I had the signature ramen which was tasty.  The meal also came with a Chinese herbal soup that was surprisingly good.  You can really tell that they didn't use MSG (which they proudly advertise) as you don't feel like you have to scrub your tongue after downing the delicious little cup of liquid.  Hubby had the neon yellow Portuguese sauce baked rice with pork chop that was merely OK and really, not worth all the calories that it'll add to your butt!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time coming to Market Village, and I always like to go try a restaurant from this side, more than going to eat in Pacific Mall. Was really craving some HK Cafe style food, and stumbled upon this place. Right in the middle of the mall, across from Ten-Ren's, it's got a pretty nice doorway. I'm sometimes a sucker for a good appearance, afterall, it is a food establishment.  We sat near the back of the restaurant, and since we were here around 3 PM, the specials menu pops right out. A pretty good selection of noodle and rice dishes, with the drink combos. I ordered a fried rice, and it was pretty big in size, also had a cold lemon tea, which came out to about $8. I was stuffed eating all of it, as when I'm on vacation, there is no waste of food. They have some nice decor, making this place look more new-age from the usual HK Cafe restaurants I'm used to going to. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 5 times. What lures me here are the set menu prices. They are pretty reasonable prices and includes drinks/soup and also an appetizer of raddish and chicken skin.  There's a wide variety of food choices. They have lots of standard HK cafe stuff and some newer, creative fusion stuff. I don't even know how to describe them in English. Some items you will not find easily elsewhere.   When I hit a HK cafe, I like to get the Portuguese sauce chicken. I've had this several times and the problem with this place is highlighted here. THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT. One time, the chicken pieces were good. Another time they were full of fat and bones. WTF?   I tend to come here with a partner so I've tried a variety of their other dishes. They are hit or miss. Some dishes have been good. Some are so so.   I'd still recommend this place because there's so much \"potential\". I think the quality of the food depends on who is working and the direction of the wind. Just cross your fingers and hope the chef will make a good dish for you. At these prices, it's not a terrible gamble. I'd certain prefer this food over the food court stuff."}
{"text":"I'm usually a generous reviewer but I'm just going to be blunt with this one.  This place sucks! If you want Chinese food or HK Cafe style food, there are many other options in the town, so don't go in there. Don't waste your money here because the pictures in the front looked nice. That's what got me in the first time. I saw their ad in a Chinese journal and was drawn in by the pictures in the front.  The food was mediocre but what really turns me off is bad service. The staff are all super grouchy looking and doesn't really care to tend to you. In fact, I actually felt afraid to put up my hand to ask for anything. When anyone try to ask for something, they look pissed and annoyed that they were bothered them. I heard a lady walked by to ask if they have something in a gentle manner, and a staff snapped a rude sounding 'no'. I thought that was unnecessary.  I'm not sure how they survived these last few years being rude like that when their food was nothing good. Frankly, I like to feel some appreciation for being a customer and I would say I can get better food and service just around the corner at any of the stalls in the food court."}
{"text":"Station Asia is a very tempting place because of all the ADS and banners of specially priced combination meals in front of their entrance.  It brings various people inside where I noticed quite a few servers for this space which doesn't seem proportional.    The servers attitudes and expressions make this place feel more of a HK Cafe rather than a stylish modern dining space that the decor made it to be.  It has the setting similar to some Hong Kong fastfood restaurants.  Looking through 5 separate Menus with various deals, it's a bit overwhelming but when offered more over less most people will choose the first option.  The Tea Time option includes Noodle($3.99) items with topping options(Curry Pork/Beef/Chicken, Satay version, Taiwanese Beef,etc...)   HK style Sandwiches(Egg, Spam & Egg, Ham & Egg, Egg Salad, etc...)($3.99) and last was Fried Chicken Wing & Fries($3.50) all of which include a Hot Beverage or Cold for additional.  My chopsticks were dirty and we made it clear to write \"C\" for Cold beverages on your self-written order list but they still gave us Hot.  Fried Chicken Wing & Fries is on par as the Wings were perfectly cooked and juicy while they seasoned the Fries while its still hot which is a standard culinary rule for many deep-fried items."}
{"text":"With all the captivating photos of their breakfast/lunch/dinner specials on large posters in front of the restaurant, it's hard walk by and not notice them. Promoted as a \"upscale\" HK-style cafe, they offer expensive items in their menus.  When they first opened, they offered lunch/dinner combos that came with soup, main course, a large list of speciality drinks, and even a dessert. But they started to cut back and downsize their portions and it is now an added cost for a combo to include a drink and dessert.   Service is generally slow, even when the restaurant isn't full. Food quality has definitely declined since the last time I tried it, though the food choices sound so intriguing. Most of the time, it is either too salty, greasy, or bland - lack of quality control.   For the price that you pay, you're better off staying in the food court."}
{"text":"Think of this as you typical asian express diner with a mix of chinese, and korean cuisines.  Their food prices are affordable ranging from $7-$12 depending on what you order, and in most cases their set meals include soup, appetizer, and tea/coffee/ or bubble tea. The facilities are very clean, and I was quite impressed by the overall cleanliness of this restaurant. Now the food!!  I ordered their braised duck, with walnuts (bimbimbap) that was served in a clay pot and a bowl of complimentary rice.  The portion, taste, presentation was quite good. 3/5 My brother ordered their Fukin Fried Rice which was average, 3/5 The mom order fried noodles with beef and veggie, which was quite on the PEPPERED side of things, but nonetheless okay.........   Overall this place is not bad, but is quick to please an empty stomach."}
{"text":"We came into this place because some of us got excited seeing \"scallop rabbitfish congee\" on the menu. I guess it was supposed to be good? I dunno... Personally, I think we \"water turtles\" got tricked with their huge flashy ad sitting outside. The scallop rabbitfish congee tasted only \"meh.\" I didn't find anything special with it. We also were going to order the \"blueberry and strawberry fried rice\" (yes, weird I know, but we just wanted to try something different) but anyways, no dice because they didn't have any blueberries nor strawberries so they wanted to substitute with papaya and cantaloupe instead (probably even weirder). Right now, I don't even remember what second dish we had order but I know we did order something. Oh well. Oh yeah, and the service was pretty shoddy as well. Felt like the server had a bad attitude. Not impressed and not coming back here."}
{"text":"Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!  Service here is utterly horrible. My party arrived at 8:45 pm we left at 10:05pm. The congee we ordered came at 9:45pm. The servers will ignore you and are completely rude. While I was there I saw one group get their own napkins. One group telling the waitress they would like to order but ignored them and then they started placin things on their table without asking them because they ran out of space in the kitchen. All this without ever asking.   My friend ordered blueberry fried rice and got green melon fried rice, upon questioning they said that they ran out of blueberries and strawberries and even said \"I forgot to mention it to you\" and never even apologized.  Terrible terrible terrible service. Do yourself a favor and avoid."}
{"text":"Ordered a black coffee with our meal. They gave us coffee with sugar. We let them know that black coffee does not have sugar. They told us that's how they do it and they won't change it. I let them kindly know that one of the guests has diabetes. They told my friend to stop having diabetes.  The food is salty but the service is saltier."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would.  This place was horrible!  So very horrible.  My boyfriend and I came to this place because we didn't feel like congee or food court whilst at Market Village.  We both had never been there, so we decided to go.  BIG MISTAKE.  We both ordered portugese sauce rice/noodles, and it was just HORRIBLE.  I really couldnt' finish it - and if ou know me well, I ALWAYS finish my food. ALWAYS.  I couldn't finish it and I felt sick afterward.  Never again."}
{"text":"They have awesome set meals, which includes soup, entree, drink, and dessert. The prices are very reasonable, set meals start at $8CAD.  I had a set meal which included a hot & sour soup, chicken and veggies on rice with xo sauce, Almond Green Tea shake, and black jelly dessert.  They offer friendly service but at times a bit slow. Overall nothing special here."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast during the Easter long weekend.  The restaurant was crowded.  We ordered two of the breakfast specials that came with milk tea.  Everything tasted okay.  The milk tea was okay, too.  However, the glasses that contained the free Chinese tea had a strong bleach smell.  The pricing and portion were okay.   Here you go: A-OK."}
{"text":"This place is garbage and I must say expensive garbage....the lunch special sucks here as there is only a total of probably 9 specials and they are not too appetizing....the food is salty as hell and portions are small, I can say that the pmall food court is better than here....the service sucked ass too, we only got suckered into here because my mom saw that they were giving away free sing tao......."}
{"text":"I come here because of the set menu and the drinks that comes with it.  There are a lot of choices to choose from Taiwanese, Curry, Japanese noodle soup, Eel with rice, Cod fish with rice in a hot pot.   The soup that comes with the meals are usually really Chinese soup prepared with Herbs that suppose to be good for you.. I found them salty and not my favourite.  There are a lot of choices of different drinks.. mostly Taiwanese style bubble tea, fruit flavoured green tea, red bean ice with ice cream, grass jello ice with ice cream, hk style milk tea. (If you want your green tea to be hot instead of cold, there will be $1 surcharge.. I ask them why, they said because they have to heat that up in the microwave.. um...)  All the set menu comes with a dessert sometimes it is turtle shell pudding, mango mousse wrap into a ball....(I don't really know what to call them.. but they are not good..)  The service is friendly but it is slow...   I would come back to this restaurant for the drinks..   They accept Credit card Visa or MC"}
{"text":"I loved loved loved the lunch I had: green tea smoked salmon and chicken.  Juicy, flavorful with a hint of turmeric and other citrus herbs, and smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture.  The gravy was sweet and peppery and was a great condiment for the already delectable meat since I really like spicy.  I enjoyed the ambiance - pretty metro with an asian flair, and the open kitchen is one of the perks in not so many restaurants that I really like.  A bit disappointed with the service though as it was slower when we came for an early lunch and they were serving only 3 or 4 tables then.  By lunch hour this place became packed in a wink.  My friend was equally satisfied with the food that filled us for a long afternoon of mall hopping and we look forward to our next lunch date, plausibly at the same place.  ;)"}
