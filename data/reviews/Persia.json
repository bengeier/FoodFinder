{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal here, my appetizer was burnt, my salad was very watery and the kebab took a very long time to arrive."}
{"text":"The Lentil soup is delicious to start a very light and flavorful meat base.  For the main dish I ordered from the menu page of stew options rather than my usual kebab.  Pomegranate and walnuts flavor the sauce over delicate veal meat balls.   I made an exception to eat veal, as I was so intrigued by the ingredients.  It was rich and Delicious.  An unusual flavor, which is probably why I was told if I did not like it I could order something else.  I loved it!  The rice was aromatic and light in texture. A delicious meal.  The waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of nice things bout this place and since I love Persian food, I wanted to try this fairly new restaurant out.

First and foremost, this place is really hard to miss, I went there with the help of GPS but this manage to be confused, the address says St-Jacques street, the reality is its in a strip mall and the entrance to the strip mall in on St-Jacques, once you enter the parking lot, thats when u notice it. 

A Friday night at 7pm and this place has only two customers, which always scares me,  a young lady welcomed us and  sat us down and brought the menu right away.  Typically Iranian restaurants offer ash or salad. Ash is a herb and bean soup, but Persia offers lentil soup and salad which was really new for me. Anyways I gave tried, it was very blahhh, anyways it didn't leave an impression.

Then came the Appetizer \"kashke bademjoon\" this was very good, its a mixture of mashed eggplants and kashk which is a fermented type of yogurt. This was delicious and what i have to mention was that they brought pita bread like a typical iranien restaurant but they would heat it which I find is a nice touch. Last but not least our main dishes, the barg (fillet mignon) and the jujeh (chicken brochette) were very average 3 stars for that. The koobide I did. Ot like at the smell of the meat really bothered me and I was not able to take more than one bite.

Now lets talk about the service and ambiance. The service was okay, a little impersonal, she was running around most the the time but always cMe and asked if we wanted anything, did we enjoy the food. It showed she was new but still very nice.

As for the ambiance, white walls, high ceilings, they have some pictures framed of Iran around the place, but I think they could have made it stand out more, specially since its not easy to find. If the inside of a restaurant wows you then you will talk about to friends and maybe draw more traffic.

All in all it was an okay experience. To be honest I probably wont be coming back as its offers the same typical, service, decor, and ambiance as the rest of them. I still enjoy Tehran more, the service is lacking there but I have always gotten very good food."}
