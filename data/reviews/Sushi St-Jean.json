{"text":"Been here before. Food was usually good. This time, the sushi tasted bland and prepared quickly. They fell apart in the plate. The beef ginger along with the pad Thai were the best from the whole meal. Oh and my gf got a big black spider on her from under the table. The waiter just laughed. Fare well sushi st jean."}
{"text":"Été avec les enfants pour l'heure du dîner en semaine.   Service vraiment ordinaire. Très déçu de l'absence de sashimis au menu du midi, ce qui était la raison principale de notre visite... Goût plutôt décevant. Une alternative beaucoup plus intéressante existe, juste de l'autre côté de la rue... ;)"}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing the sign through the kanda sushi window while having dinner at Kanda.  Place is new, medium size ....great decor and modern, may be its brand new...also caters for all group size..2-6. Also saw a section on the side for large group.  Went with my gf for dinner on a friday eve. This is an all you can eat place  The lady at the door have an attitude and not so friendly, seems like all the female staff have some sort of an attitude issue... on the other hand all the male staff are very friendly and helpful.  Each table will get a galaxy tablet to order. Unfortunately the lady waitress didn't bother explaining anything and she just left the tab at the table and walked away...so we assumed all and ordered...the male staff were happy to answer our questions..While ordering u can see the picture of the sushi and its content.. once u submit ur order one waiter will bring a print out of ur order to ur table.   So when waiter brings your food, they cross the print out to make sure u received ur order. That also helps me, majority of the time all these all u can eat places we were not sure if we got all the food and also if we got the right food. This also helped me here, the waitress showed up at my table with sushi even though i got mine and it was crossed, she showed up crossed on top of it....and i have to tell her hey listen i already got this and its crossed. seems like she wanna push her leftovers on to us...  Also noticed that they put reserve signs for all the booth to pack the first comers and save the booth for late comers. Even though we showed up at 830pm. And we stayed until 9:45-10:0 and majority of the booths were not taken.  Quality of sushi is good compared to other \"all you can eat\" places in west island. Enough variety compared to other places, Its taste fresh.  A good place to enjoy sushi and will definitely go back, (will ignore the female staff ) just because the quality of the food.  Price to quality and value its good.  Will definitely go back and recommend to all sushi lovers  PT"}
{"text":"Hv been 3 times. Food is ok. Service is terrible. No air conditioning so during summer is really hot. Once they added a pizza sushi to our order! ...and on a Friday night they disable sashimi on the menus so if you don't know or don't ask they take advantage. Not planning to go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been looking for an \"all you can eat\" sushi place to replace our usual Kanda, since being challenged on a tip on our last visit. Though good, it is still a \"work in progress\".   Sunday-Thursday 22.99 Friday-Saturday 24.99.   As Mark G. reviewed, do not drink the water. They only offer Perrier as a substitute, they do not have bottled or filtered water.   They have yet to obtain their liquor license, so you're limited to soft drinks or juice.   The service was good, however our first server struggled in communicating with us, whereas the second server was completely fluent.   As per Mark G's comments in regards to the ordering, I would have to once again agree. It does leave room for error. We ordered shrimp skewers, which aren't for the faint of heart. The entire shrimp is left on, and you must peel away the shell, head and tail.   I had to specifically ask for vegetarian sushi, due to it not being listed on the menu. Once it arrived, we were a little overwhelmed by there being 12 pieces of sushi, and not the usual 2 or 4. Their definition of a vegetarian roll is different, and quite good; avocado, tofu, cucumber, mango and egg. A touch on the sweet side and very refreshing!  We did order ginger chicken near the end of our meal, though they did forget to bring it to us, we aren't complaining, considering we were quite full.   My friend, who is a sushi enthusiast, says that it was all very fresh. She ordered her usual Californian, crab meat Sashimi, cucumber and Dragon sushi. The General Tao was also polished off.      They are lenient in regards to their $1.00 charge per leftover sushi.  Decor is very nice, a clean place, though the bathrooms were a little dirty.   All in all a good experience. We plan on going back again on Friday to test out our new knowledge int he ways of ordering sushi."}
{"text":"I tried this place because my usual go-to place was closed for vacations, and it seemed to get a lot of hype on the recent opening.  I'm really not impressed with the quality of the sushi. I've had food court sushi that was tastier and better made than what I got here. To give credit where credit is due: the fish was fresh and tender. But no taste to anything. No interesting flavour, the tastes and textures didn't blend together, the rolls were loose. The tempura was chewy.   It was just the sum of its parts. I could have taken a bite of raw fish, a spoonful of rice and some chopped up cucumber and seaweed and chewed it up. Nothing special. I tried one of everything just to be sure, and was done.  Wi Sushi just up the street is infinitely better. Tasty, made to order, quality sushi. Even Kanda is better if you're looking for all you can eat. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Staff were slow and rude. The food was horrible. Everything tasted the same. Everything tastes deep fried and greasy with no distinguished flavours. Your better off going to kanda sushi."}
{"text":"The worst place for group lunch. They don't give you the food on-time! We were 20 people on table 46.   We had people that needed to leave without eating! They didn't bring a lot of our orders (particularly ones that are more costly for them)!!   When we asked the manager (David) to not charge for the people who could not eat, he offered 10% discount, while charging the whole 20 people 15% service charge.   DON'T go there if you're a big group!!"}
{"text":"Not a great value. The sushi is ok. Not made to order. Other dishes are swimming in manufactured sauces. I find the wait staff to relaxed. Not eager to explain the tablet menu with a smile. Acted like they did me a favour when they did not charge me full price for my 2 year daughter for eating 2 bites of a popcorn chicken dish. Ok if your staving and plan on eating a lot. Food is served fast. Not a place if your looking to try a variety of memorable dishes or sushis."}
{"text":"Price is a lil on the expensive side but the food was amazing. Their menu are extensive, reservations are a must. The place is packed almost every night. The service is \"so-so\". I went there on a tremendously busy night so I could understand it took 20 minutes or more per service. Contrarily with Kanda, you will not spend 30 minutes on the toilet bowl after eating their food. Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. Good temperature, AMAZING ambiance and nice techie way of ordering food. Very efficient.  Sadly no sake or other alcoholic beverage since they didn't get their license yet. The place is still quite new and improving. Keep an eye on it!  P.S. Don't take the beef teriyaki (or whatever they decided to call it on their menu). It tastes like Windex, misery, pain, sorrow and hatred."}
{"text":"I typically don't do all you can eat, especially not all you can eat \"sushi\"... but my niece and nephew love this place and I was pleasantly surprised about quality quantity and price. Fun rolls for the kids who aren't true sushi lovers. Fun atmosphere for a family lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Really below grade, msg packed, pre made. Poor service. I guess you get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Pros:  -good sashimi -good tempuras -good parking  Cons:  -Way too much rice in sushi, like way too much, like please, I came here for sushi not rice balls.  -Grilled saumon is often overcooked almost feels like chewing a cheap dollarama cookie.  -Like every sushi buffet does, many of your orders to be cut down or simply won't show up or even showing up after you are eating your dessert. Why would I want my takoyaki when I'm wrapping up my supper with my ice cream? Why?  -The service is average. They do their job, nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"Usually with all you can eat sushi you tend to sacrifice quality for quantity. Not here! Not only do they have a huge menu with tons of choices, not to mention a great variety of kitchen food as well. Servers were more than happy to answer questions and make recommendations. The tablets you order off of were super user friendly and service was lightning quick. I was disappointed they did not have any tuna but the food was great regardless! Great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Rather bland and tamed with the same instances. Many of the sushis have worthy of comparison taste notes.The spicy salmon and the spicy oily fish are one of the same. Although, the service is really fast and efficient (use of a tablet for ordering)."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once, not worth it. Matsuno nearby has better quality. For lunch it's pretty decent, and sashimi is included! Though for a cheaper price, there is hasu in Kirkland, personally I eniiy the actual sushi and rolls better there. The rolls are messy and have too much rice. But there is quite an extensive menu, and the ordering system is electronic and very efficient. Waiters are friendlier than at hasu. There is a much bigger variety of cooked food. I love ordering the more unique items, like the whole sanma fish, salmon head, capelin...the sashimi is decent quality for ayce.h The soy sauce is regular, not light, so I find it far too salty.  Come for lunch, dinner I found to not be worth it, though I may try again someday."}
{"text":"I decided to try out sushi St. Jean based on the recommendation of my friend and then the review of Mark G below. I'm not sure how many stars to give Sushi St. Jean because I loved it and didn't like it at the same time. Confusing right?  My co-worker and I went on a Thursday during lunch and the service is super speedy unlike Kanda which is directly across the street. We were sat down immediately and handed an ipad without any explanation as to what to do. Good thing we are smart enough to figure it out, click the picture of what you want. When you are finished hit SEND. I was a bit upset to discover that some sushi rolls weren't available; especially something as common as Spicy Salmon. I could eat pounds and pounds of that but didn't have not even one piece here.   The food arrived at lightening fast speed. That was great. I noticed that their kitchen foods were much better than their sushi. The sushi actually left a lot to be desired. A lot of the sushi was covered in sauces. I wasn't a fan of that as I'm picky and hate sauce. (I eat my dumplings and spring rolls with soy sauce and wasabi).   There was no low-sodium soy sauce which was also a bit upsetting and lead to large amounts of water being consumed which meant that when we left I felt like I needed to be rolled out of there instead of walking. The wasbai was HOT and I loved that. I feel like a lot of places make their wasabi far too tame,. I should have tried the wasbai prior to adding it to my soy sauce because I used too much!   Also, when it came time to pay the bill my co-worker paid and left a small tip. He told the server to keep all the change and then he was going to leave some more change on the table for him. The waiter actually looked at him and was like, \"That's it?\" Dude are you kidding me? Our server changed 10 times through the lunch hour and we had the intention of leaving more money on the table. He wasn't going to break a 10 when he had some loonies and toonies in his pocket! I found that very rude.  I would go back for their kitchen items but really scale back on the amount of boring sushi we had."}
{"text":"sushi is alright here. It's good if you're really hungry because you can get all you can eat for like 30$. it's always super busy, especially during the weekend. make sure you show up early or call in advance."}
{"text":"Strongly not recommended if you are thinking about going in big groups. We had a reservation at 7:30 for 12 people and were seated fairly quickly. However, what ensues was just bad. Since we were a large group, we made a large order. Typically, these all-you-can-eat places rarely honour your whole order, so we ordered more on top of it expecting half our order not showing up. What we had was consistently 25% of our order come. Up until their last service, some of the people at our table were still hungry.  As per the food, it is your run off the mill ayce sushi place, with subpar sushi and sashimi. It's fine if you want a quick fix of sushi, but nothing extraordinary.  Overall, if you crave and starve for sushi, I guess this place is fine, but make sure to be 4 or less if you want to get your food."}
{"text":"The sushi is average. The service is pretty decent. You get a receipt with every order so you can keep track of what you ordered. The upside is that you get soft drinks too, which are included."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is absolutely terrible.  Let me start with the food before I explain the service. The fish is fresh, and doesn't have that weird waxy texture you experience sometimes. The temperature is also good, not cold. The selection is also excellent, far better that Kanda across the street. This aspect is actually pretty close to perfect for an all you can eat. Unfortunately, we don go to a restaurant only for the food, but the service as well. That's were the story is:  We were a group of 4, for supper on a Thursday night. It was quite busy, all the tables were full.  We started off the evening with a very quick request for our order, even before we had a chance to see the menu at length and before our whole party had arrived. Normally, this takes the longest, so we were happy that it looked like the service would be nice and prompt.  My friend and I ordered the sushi pizza and some teriyaki chicken while we waited for the other 2 people to show up. It took almost 15 minutes for that order to arrive, by which point we had prepared our second order after the party was complete.  That order took close to 20 minutes to arrive, and we placed our third order. This is where everything went downhill.  We waited and waited, and were delivered sushi pizza again, despite not remembering ordering it. Alright, we were hungry, having waited over 10 minutes at that point at an empty table. Then we saw what looked like our order delivered to a table next to us. The people at that table seemed confused, but they didn't really argue and took a large plate with over 40 pieces on it. Then, we got another sushi pizza. This was a bit of a surprise, but hey, we were hungry... We asked the waited to look into our order, and he couldn't find it anymore. So we made another one.  Then I witnessed something that had our table in tears we were laughing so hard, because a table behind us received an order of sushi pizza, and they had the most perplexed look on their face as the waiter served it to them. They had clearly not ordered it. But they took the plate anyways.  Finally, 35 minutes after we had finished the second order, and two sushi pizzas we didn't order arrived, we got half of the third order. At this point we were fed up, but still hungry, so we placed a 4th and final order.  The second half of the third order never showed up, but we got half of the 4th order.  All in all, we spent 2 hours and 15 minutes at the restaurant, and had food on our table for about 30 minutes of that.  I'm returning today and hope the service is better when they aren't as busy. I will report back to be sure."}
{"text":"The sushi was so fresh and so yum ,, we went lunch hour we had to wait in line because it was so busy make reservations before you go to get seated faster,, you order from your tablet,,, salmon is super fresh melts in your mouth ,,, crabs were super yumm and fresh ,, love it differently going back,, we usually order on the phone but to sit there and eat is way better"}
{"text":"One of my best hangouts sushi places.   Good formula lunch or dinner with all what you can eat.   Kudus on the menu but they can do better on the pace of service."}
{"text":"Ok I waited plenty of time before revisiting. Work out kinks, etc... Well... It sucks. End of story. Why it's busy is beyond me at this point. It's expensive, tasteless food.  Big whoop..it's all you can eat.  Two buckets of bad shrimp for the price of one isn't any more appealing.  The wait staff doesn't give a hoot about their customers and they can't make it clearer than literally trying to take plates that we're still eating, reaching over our plates that we are eating from to get an empty dish without even an excuse me.  At the end of the meal when the bill is there we are given a very rude how are you paying. We were sitting and talking and not ready to go so buzz off. Then you have the audacity to come and tell me that you don't approve of the way I'm sitting in a booth.  Guess what?  Never again.  Tie that with the insipid need to keep changing the light colours in an attempt to be hip and the whole thing just sucked donkey tail."}
{"text":"I use to go to this restaurant maybe once or twice a month which is quite a few times. The service is great. Staff is very quite and just tend to do they're job but it would've been nice to speak a little bit. The sushi is excellent. I haven't tried everything on the menu but I haven't tasted anything yet that I disliked.   The reason why I am giving 2 stars out of 5 is because last time I went, which wasn't long ago, I was with my boyfriend and him and I got food poisoning. At first I thought maybe it's just me but when I ask my boyfriend he told me he's having the same symptoms.   Although this was my favourite sushi restaurant, i don't think I will be visiting it anymore and if I do, I won't get anything with fish which is not really a great experiment if your eating sushi!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend on a Friday and arrived ~12:15pm and we were lucky enough to find a parking spot in the parking lot. We originally wanted to go to the sushi place across the street (I believe that the name was Kanda) but we discovered as we drove by Blvd St-Jean that it was closed down. The parking lot in front of Sushi St-Jean gets full very quickly. At the time that we arrived, we were seated almost immediately.  This was my first time eating here but I've been to various AYCE (all you can eat) sushi places and I found this place to be good. I did not have any issues with the service or food. Unlike the other places that I've been to which require you to indicate on a piece of paper the quantity of the item(s) that you want, this place has you do it on a tablet which has pictures for every item. On the tablet, you select whether you want the screens to be in English or French and then indicate the quantity of the item that you want shown in the picture. There is then an option on the screen to send your order to the kitchen. The wait staff will then bring your order to your table when the item is ready. When my friend and I ordered from the tablet, there were a few times that the tablet's screen appeared to be frozen but one of the wait staff assisted us with this when he noticed that we were having an issue.  I had a variety of maki rolls, sushi, tempura dishes, and Asian dishes from their menu: http://www.sushistjean.ca/main/en.html  My friend and I finished off with ice cream for dessert. They had 3 flavours (mango, green tea, and red bean). I had 1 scoop of each. My friend didn't really care for the mango but I liked all 3 flavours. When we left at ~1:30pm, there was a line to be seated.  My only negative comment about this place is that unlike other AYCE sushi places that I've tried for lunch (such as Kanda, Fisshu, and Sushi Plus), Sushi St-Jean doesn't offer sashimi. It only offers sashimi during dinner. So if you want the raw salmon, you have to get it with the rice on the bottom. One of the plates had small bits/pieces of sashimi on what appeared to be on a Pringle chip. I never had this at any other sushi restaurant before so I found this unusual.  Sushi St-Jean doesn't accept Interac or American Express. They do accept Mastercard and Visa. They have a sign at the entrance of the door indicating this.  I rate Sushi St-Jean 4 stars but I am not sure if I would go back there since they don't have sashimi during lunch and it is a bit out of the way for me to go there (even though I have a car and there are various buses that stop relatively close-by at the Fairview Shopping Center)."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD! This place is just the best all you can eat sushi place ive ever been.  Good quality? Yes. Service? Sooo quick. Convenient? Yesss- You order from tablets, and just order whatever you want. And the food comes really quick.  There was just a bit of a lineup, but we didnt even wait that long. The food quality is pretty good compared to other all you can eat sushi places. I would definitely come back here, only if it was closer to downtown."}
{"text":"Greatest thing about the place is the service. They have you order on a tablet, which might come off as gimmicky at first, but allows for very speedy service and browsing through photos of the menu. The food was overall pretty decent, not sure how it compares with other all you can eat sushi places, but the salmon was a bit bland. The selection was varied, and like mentioned before, the service was excellent, with waiters rushing to clean out dirty plates and refill empty water glasses. Would go again."}
{"text":"I went there with my SO this week, and we were floored by the quality of the food! Don't believe the bad reviews, they have settled, they have liquor, and the service was GREAT. To any of you concerned about the \"lack of tuna\" you need to pick up a newspaper and READ:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2012534/Five-tuna-species-risk-extinction.html  So I really don't care at all! I'd recommend it in a HEARTBEAT and I hope they put Kanda out of business. Finally, an all you can eat sushi option that is FRESH and good quality!  EDIT: I'll be damned if this place gets the same review as a garbage place like Kanda."}
{"text":"The only reason you go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant is to order as much of everything as possible. Bearing that in mind, it is impossible to expect any real quality sushi (or anything).   The fish used might be fresh, but their sushi are bland and stale. The sautéed meet dishes were fine but only because they were saucy and salty (much like general tso chicken at an AYCE Chinese). The same goes for the majority of their menu items.   I rarely criticize service as there is usually a minimum to ensure a healthy restaurant experience. The service here is well below the minimum! On all three occasions (which, for the record, I was brought back against my will), service was horrible. I can forgive a server for mixing up orders and making mistakes as we are only human, but no paying customer should ever have to experience the sort of attitude received here.   Tipping. It is usually a straight forward process: 15% if satisfied; more if amazing; less if dissatisfied, and servers leave you to your decision. Not here. God help you if you tip a penny less than 15%. I have seen servers argue for their dues, even attempt to overcharge/ keep the change for tip. For some reason I remember them including a service tax for some time and still requiring you to pay a 15% tip.  In sum, if you have to eat here you should do so during the lunch time special. The $30+ for dinner (after 14h00) is just too expensive for what you get.  Pro tip: for the same price you can eat to your fill at an à-la-carte sushi restaurant: i.e. Tokyo Trésor, Soho, etc."}
{"text":"It's interesting how Sushi St. Jean opened their restaurant right across the street from Kanda, another all you can eat sushi bar. It might have been annoying if Sushi St. J didn't sling sushi so much better than Kanda.  PROs - Ordering off a tablet (you can see each item, no waiting to order, best thing ever) - Service is FAST (instead of bringing everything at once, waiters will keep coming back with plates and check them off a list) - Staff is friendly (IMO a rarity when service is unconventional) - Sushi is tasty (all of this would count for nothing if the product wasn't good) - Large variety (I don't know how they manage from a operations standpoint)  CONs - Pricey (Despite a totally justified price, there are cheaper places to get a sushi dinner) - Last call on orders is an hour before closing (Justified and obvious but still a point worth mentioning)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice restaurant with a modern touch. Classic look for this sushi chain.  FOOD: The sushis are ok, they aren't the best and don't taste the freshest. Also, they put way too much rice in their sushi (which I'm sure is to fill you up as fast as possible). However, their hot foods are pretty good! And I like the fact that they offer takoyakis (fried octopus balls) at dinner. Overall, food is decent, not the best place to go though.  PRICE: Standard prices for lunch and dinner for an all-you-can-eat sushi spot.  SERVICE: Service isn't the best. Before they changed management, service was terrible. But nowadays, it has gotten better. They aren't the friendliest but they are very efficient."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying, this was my first ever sushi experience. I had never had the opportunity in the past because my bf is allergic to all fish and seafood, so I never had someone to share it with. A few girlfriends decided our next girls' night would include a sushi stop in order to pop my proverbial cherry.  We tried to make a reservation on a Saturday night at 7:30, but word to the wise, no reservations are taken between 6 & 8pm on Saturdays. And also, for those who stated there was no alcohol, they have indeed procured their liquor licence, so the next time you're here, you can wash down your sushi with a cold pint of Sapporo. Also, a few people mentioned the water was undrinkable; this is no longer the case. The water was perfectly fine.  Back to the important stuff! We arrived at about 7:30 to a line almost out the door. We saw a lot of tables looking ready to leave, so we decided to stick around because everything looked SO DELICIOUS!! We waited about 30 minutes, which really isn't that bad, and were seated. The decor is modern and classy, staff is polite and attentive. Once we were seated, our table was handed a tablet and explained how to order. I am in love with this concept! The entire menu is loaded onto it, with descriptions of each item and the option to add whatever number you desire. Once your order is complete, you send it to the kitchen. A disclaimer is displayed explaining that for every uneaten piece, you will be charged 1$, so all bases are covered. Once your order is sent, a printed up \"receipt\" is given to your table and every time a dish is brought out, it gets crossed off. This is an awesome way to reduce human error. And the service was quite quick and friendly.  Now, on to the pièce de resistance! OH. EM. GEEE!! I was floored at how much I actually enjoyed the sushi and sashimi. We had salmon sashimi, spicy dragon eye, kamikaze, california, tempura, cucumber... It's all a magnificent and delicious blur! My favourite would have to be the spicy dragon eye. Everything was so fresh and there was no lack of flavour. I will definitely be back to try even more from their extensive menu! A definite recommendation for sushi newbs and aficionados alike!"}
