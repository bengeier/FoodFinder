{"text":"I am so happy to have discovered this gem on Notre Dame near Atwater-was there with some friends and our kids and we were all extremely pleased with the food, ambiance and service.  The Caesar salad was fantastic with a salty hit from the anchovies, the soup of the week (a roasted cauliflower creamy concoction) was excellent, our margarita pizzas had a great chewy crust and not too sweet sauce, and the French onion soup pizza with lardons was delicious.  My only complaints would be that the french fries, although tasty, were disappointing because they were mostly ends and bits with only some regular cut fries thrown in, and the wine choices were few with no organic wines on the list at all.   Also some wines were unavailable and others weren't in the list at all.  The service was efficient and friendly answering all of our questions with ease.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place, have been several times with friends and for business. The menu is small but what they do, they do well. Simple but excellent is a good recipe! The pizza margarita is fresh, well prepared, the kale salad and soups are good. Only caveat - wine by the glass is vastly overpriced, and once I went with a colleague, told the waiter it was his birthday, and he charged for the dessert with the candle. Usually a restaurant comps this, but it wasn't enough to mar the overall feeling that this little gem is 
reliable and super pleasant."}
{"text":"Foyer is a lovely new restaurant situated on the West side of Atwater in St Henri.  The menu is primarily wood oven pizza with some fish and some incredible appetizers.  Though the restaurant is very warm and inviting it was a beautiful night and we dined on the back terrace.  Though it is not large it is lined with cute herb pots made from large soup cans, a little kitsch but rather charming.

The food, though a bit expensive was definitely worthwhile.  We shared the salmon tartare and the Caesar salad.  The tartar was light and flavorful, I would highly recommend it.  The Caesar would not have been outstanding on its own but with the addition of  fried mussels it was fantastic.

For our main dish we chose to design our own pizza, as a base we took the shishito pepper pizza added mushrooms, spinach and hot peppers. Though this is not a thin crust pizza like I normally prefer, the dough was chewy and tasty as was the combination of toppings.  We were also really glad to see that one of our favorite wine was available on the menu, the perfect accompaniment to our fantastic dinner.

The service was friendly and attentive, I would definitely recommend this resto."}
{"text":"My sister called me up and told me she had reservations for a great little pizza place in the Atwater market area that she had heard great things about and did I want to come? I rarely say no to pizza and I was looking forward to trying out a new place, so yes yes yes was my reply.

Foyer is nestled between a hair salon and another restaurant, pretty non descript from the outside but it has a warm, cozy ambience inside. We were greeted by friendly staff and quickly shown to our table.

The menu is not huge but their pizza selection is very interesting and definitely original. We weren't starving so we shared a salmon tartar, which arrived very quickly. it was fresh but a little lacking as far as taste, good but nothing memorable. 

As for the pizzas, we decided to each order our own and share.
I was torn between the smoked meat pizza and an onion soup pizza, the smoked meat pizza had bechamel sauce, grainy mustard, gherkin pickles, bacon and smoked meat. It sounded a little strange in terms of flavor combinations but our waiter assured me it was delicious and was a top seller.  The onion soup pizza had bechamel sauce, caramalized onions, bacon and gruyère. It sounded delicious but I wasnt in an onion mood so I decided on the smoked meat.

My 2 dining companions ordered the Margherita and added on mushrooms and the other order a pepperoni, chorizo, hot pepper pizza.

Our pizzas soon arrived and we all traded a slice. My smoked meat pizza looked good but I still wasn't overly excited and wondered if it was a wrong choice. Thankfully my first bite proved me otherwise. The crust was crispy and on the thin side without being wafer thin. The bechamel was creamy and the saltiness of the smoked meat and the crunch of the gherkins made for an interesting contrast of textures and flavors. 

The pepperoni, chorizo, hot pepper pizza was amazing, spicy perfection! Definitely my favorite!

The Margherita with mushrooms was also good but didn't tantalize my taste buds, it was good but didn't stand out or make my mouth happy like pizza should.

All in all, tasty pizza, a good choice if you want to enjoy a non traditional pizza experience.

We were offered desert, the chocolate mousse looked tasty but we were all stuffed with no room for anything else. We got our bill and the waiter came back with our leftovers in a box with a cute drawing of a \"scary\"pizza, one of the waiters is an artist and likes to decorate the to go boxes, a cute touch:)

I would definitely come back but only if I was in the mood for a change from my tried and true favorites.

3 pizzas, 2 glasses of wine and 1 appetizer, 105$ including tip."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to sumac but it was full so we found this place and it was a pleasant surprise!! The menu seems to have changed a bit since we last went. We had this one appetizer dish, it was a cheesy dip with egg, and they gave us all this bread to dip with, it was so good!!!!! We kept running out of bread and they kept bringing us more bread! I ate so much bread, that by the time my pizza came, I couldn't eat it because I was so full. But don't worry, I took the pizza home and ate it the next day, it was still amazing."}
{"text":"Foyer is a great new addition to the ever developing restaurant scene on Notre Dame West of Atwater. They serve pizza, cooked in their wood burning oven, fish, salads and always have a daily special or two. The ambiance is great and they have a lovely little patio in the back.

So far I've tried the caesar salad (be sure to add the optional fried mussels), the mushroom pizza, the margherita pizza, the french onion pizza and their homemade raspberry pie. The caesar salad and raspberry pie were big winners and my favorite pizza was the french onion. 

The pizza here is not prepared like the thin crust pies that you would find at some of my favorite Montreal pizza destination (Magpie & Botegga). The crust is a bit thicker and has a much more chewy/doughy texture so you don't get the crispiness and bubbling dough that I tend to enjoy. That being said I really enjoy the pizza here and I appreciate the fact that Foyer has their unique style and taste. 

The servers were all very friendly and attentive, although not all aspects of the service are running like a well oiled machine yet. Of course this is to be expected as the resto has only been open for 2 weeks. I wish the team at Foyer great success and will certainly be back to see them soon."}
{"text":"Such a great space! Very excited about this location and excited about the Parlor Coffee."}
{"text":"The vibe in this place is perfection. Loved trying the kaffe tonic. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Don't go here waste of time and waste of money at least for the pizza!!!! The pizza they should call it bread and tomato sauce. 

Although they're trying to be creative it doesn't work. The pizza is plain and boring and the crust sucks. 

Avoid this place if you want pizza !!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in during their preview event and wow, what a wonderful place! I was able to try their signature Kaffe Tonic (espresso poured over bubbly tonic water) and it was so good! Sorta bitter and sweet, but very refreshing. They have a nice tea selection too. I saw them measuring the tea, pouring the correct temperature water for the tea, and setting a timer so it steeps properly. I didn't try any, but it smelled amazing! 

For food, they had pastries from Tommy's Pastries in Lakewood. I tried a sample of the Apple Croissant -- talk about addictive! A few fresh-sliced apples wrapped inside Tommy's super-soft, buttery dough. I could definitely see myself getting one of these every week. The manager said they'll introduce lunch items soon too. 

Finally, like other reviewers, I agree that this place is beautiful. It's such an elegant cafe and a very cool vibe."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a 4.5 out of 5. It's almost perfect but just not quite there yet so I'll give them 4 as I have to leave some wiggle room for improvement!

I've been a few times so far since it's conveniently located 2 streets down from my apartment. So far, the boyfriend and I tried their pizzas, salads, meat of the day, and desserts. Everything is fabulous and fresh. I particularly like that some ingredients were added to the pizza after it was cooked to keep their freshness. For example, figs and prosciutto. The figs were so plump and fresh, amazing. The meat of the day is always a nice plate that is well thought out so don't get turned off by the steep price, it's well worth it. If you have a sweetthoot has just like I do, I recommend the homemade doughnut. It's filled with a delicious lemon curd and it's served warm with some sprinkled sugar. The apple pie is also great but if you expect an North American apple pie you'll be disappointed. There isn't much cinnamon or spiced to it, the boyfriend who hates cinnamon simple loves this dessert. We haven't had the chocolate mousse yet since the staff highly recommends the 2 other desserts. 

Price wise, the pizzas are average price, something around $16-$18. The meat of the day is around $30 and desserts are $5. I never have much to drink since this is our \"we got late from the office let's not cook\" joint so I can't give much details on the wine list. 

Ambience wise they really hit the spot. It's got that laid back yeah classy feeling which blends perfectly with the neighbourhood. On week nights they will have music in the \"John Mayer\" category and the tempo increases as you get later in the week and night. 

A reservation on Friday and Saturday is recommended, they can usually accommodate walk-ins any other day. 

Oh, did I mention they have an authentic wood burning pizza oven!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place in St.henri... Definitely a place I recommend! Yum... Had the mozzarella/tomato with extra basil, just the right flavors and the kale salad with mango,tangerine and honeydew was perfect! 
Next time I'm having the pizza!
The bread, not on the menu but if you ask they'll make you a nice home made concoction."}
{"text":"Four à pizza napolitain à 600 degrés et une magnifique ambiance.

Le restaurant est dirigé par deux jeunes femmes novices dans le domaine de la restauration mais qui ont cerné les goûts des habitants de St Henri.

Le menu est composé principalement de pizza avec un viande et un poisson du jour.

La viande du jour était excellente mais déçu par le prix (environs 30$ pour un plat, c'est chère) et les prix ne sont pas affiché (pour les plats du jours).

Les pizzas ne sont pas très dispendieuses par rapport à la qualité servie dans votre assiette. 
Ma préférée : figue et prosciutto

Coup de cur pour la tarte au pomme à la mode (avec un boule de crème glacé) (la tarte ne contient pas de cannelle : Miam !)

Madame a adoré la pizza Soupe à l'onion

Prix d'une pizza : 15-20 $ ou plus si on ajoute des ingrédients ;)

Mention spécial aux serveurs : très attentifs et polis"}
{"text":"I walked in on a chilly evening and I absolutely loved it ! Fresh food, great pizza and very cute decor. The only downside is it gets quite chilly when sitting next to the door. But besides that, totally worth a visit. And very reasonable prices, too!"}
