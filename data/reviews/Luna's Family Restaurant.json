{"text":"Luna's is good comfort food in a cozy setting.  The menu selections won't knock your socks off, but the selections are \"down home yummie\" and the portions are generous.

My wife and I visited for dinner on a Tuesday evening.  There were three or four other tables taken when we entered.  Our waitress, Jillian (sp?), greeted us and got our drink orders out very quickly.  We both ordered one of the daily specials -- Hawaiian Chicken -- which was served with the entree, choice of potato, vegetables, soup, AND a dessert, all for $8.99.  Jillian said we could substitute a salad for the soup for an extra dollars, but we just had the soup.  My wife had the tomato and rice while I had chicken noodle.  The soups were hot and flavorful, even if a little on the salty side.

When the chicken was served, I was surprised at the portion size.  Both of us received two good-sized chicken breasts along with the sides mentioned above.  I had mashed potatoes and gravy while my wife had the hash browns.  Neither of us could finish the meal and we each took one chicken breast and a fair portion of our potatoes home.  The steamed vegetables were pretty standard and appeared to be a reheated frozen mixture of carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli.  Nothing special, but they were served hot and they were filling.

The chicken was also hot and cooked properly.  I am guessing that the \"Hawaiian\" nature was simply the result of taking the regular chicken entree and adding teriyaki sauce and pineapple tidbits.  It wasn't bad, but the chicken would have benefited from being marinated beforehand.

Dessert choices were limited to orange Jello or rice pudding (ack!), but Jillian was a trooper and let me taste the rice pudding before I went with the Jello...

I wouldn't call Luna's \"fine dining,\" but that's not what they claim to be, either.  It was good food, though, and the service was great!  

We have also eaten breakfast at Luna's and enjoyed it very much.  Again, basic \"Americana\" fare, but made and served well!"}
{"text":"It's not great but it's not terrible. A typical diner. Clean was a little short staffed for a Saturday morning. The hashbrowns could have used a little more flavor. The eggs were no frills no seasoning."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place. Been here a few times and everytime, my family was LITERALLY the only people in there. It's always 100% empty. Don't even know how they stay in business. Staff is kind, but they are often watching TV or on their phones (since there are no customers).. but the food is very low quality. Wouldn't trust meat from here .. I've only ever ordered eggs and toast from here (even for dinner). Those were obviously good and worth the price but I would never order anything else from here. Seems dirty too. Just a very run down mom and pop place."}
{"text":"First time here.... Fantastic service, super clean, great fish fry! Prices are low.. Will for sure come again"}
{"text":"Great fish dinner must go place service is great soups you can't make your self can't go worng with anything on menu"}
{"text":"Food and service excellent. Price is good. Could not have expected more in a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Small family place run by very friendly folks. Nothing gourmet going on here, but solid food. The ratings system leaves me feeling as if 3.5 would be the proper rating, but somehow 3 seems too low. If in the area and you want a decent breakfast for a reasonable price, stop by.  A foodie seeking new adventures? Head elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately. 

Our server was nice 

I ordered a skillet and it was delicious! 
My husband ordered an omelet and said it was good too. 

The coffee has a unique taste to it. Maybe a nutty taste, not sure. 

The inside of the restaurant was very clean and nice. They had it tastefully decorated for Halloween. 

We would come back."}
{"text":"I love this little hidden gem!  Such nice people work here and give you a ton of food.  We try to come and support them because it's all about supporting local family business.  You won't be disappointed by the food or serving size.... the decor, probably lol"}
{"text":"This is a  great place for a good hearty breakfast.  The portions are huge and most reasonably priced.  I enjoy the corned beef hash, home fries and eggs.  My wife favors the skillet meals.  Food is served by polite staff.  The place is not fancy, but it is clean and the food is wonderful.  The current ownership took a failed business and turned it around 180 degrees-great job!"}
{"text":"What a nice greasy spoon. We were driving along and saw it was open so we decided to stop. I'm so glad we did. My husband got the Philly cheesesteak and it was delicious and a big portion. I got a Rueben and it was huge!  The kids meals for $3.99 were enough for an adult. This place has been here for almost a year. I wish them well. We will definitely be back to try breakfast sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Am so happy to have Luna's in Brunswick. Used to go to the Parma store. New one does not have the dessert case the other does. My friend had eggs Benedict, which she liked very much. I ordered a 3 egg scramble with bacon home fries and toast. Did not realize the bacon would be scrambled into eggs. Made it too salty, home fries good and large portion. Coffee great, service terrific. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Best place in Brunswick for breakfast or lunch! Prices are very reasonable and the portions are enormous!!!"}
