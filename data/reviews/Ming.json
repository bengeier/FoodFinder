{"text":"Ming is, quite possibly, the hippest bar in Calgary.  From its ironic communist theme to its knockout cocktails it's completely unique in this city's scene.  The food is tasty too: a variety of appetizers to enjoy with your buddhas or lenins.  Its decor is inspired, with red lighting and plenty of nooks to sit in and watch the crowd. Two thumbs up from this lady!"}
{"text":"THE BEST!!! The food is great, the drinks are unique and delicious (Try the sangria). Honestly had one of the best servers I've ever had here! It's on 17th..it has a patio.. what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and awesome staff! 3 for $28 is a great way to enjoy their wide menu selection - we had the Thai curry chicken, ginger beef, Cantonese noodles and gyoza, each of which was superb. We will definitely be back! Excellent work!"}
{"text":"I'll always have a soft-spot for MING.  I used to go often during University as the food and beverages were reasonable and the decor had a charm that appealed to the politico in me, and still does.  It's very intimate, which is nice if you're looking for some place cozy.  The fireplaces are definitely nice during the cooler months.  They used to be known for their sweet potato fries with banana ketchup, and used to be one of the only places in the city where you could find sweet potato fries.  Now everyone and their dog seems to carry it, but MING still has it as an option on their menu.  My favourite dish is the Red Square burger, partly because of the name, but mainly because of the value in terms of how much you get for what you pay.  Part of the appeal of the venue is it's atmosphere, and in addition to being intimate, they always have some kind of whacky video playing in the background.  MING's only open evenings and late night, but it's a nice, quiet place to hang out with friends if you're looking for a place to chat.  23/30"}
{"text":"This bar has an interesting  Asian/Communist theme and is great for groups, but cozy enough for a date.. Great original drinks, always good service and pretty decent food. Can, of course get busy on a weekend, which means a wait. It's gay friendly and has holds a Film Festival once a year..how much cooler does a place get?"}
{"text":"I went to Ming for my friends birthday and we had a blast! She had chose Ming as her dinner location as she saw they had a shrimp stir fry she just had to try. Didn't get her input on the food, but everything that was ordered looked amazing! I had saw on here that the ginger beef was worth they try and when it comes to Chinese food, ginger beef is my fave! HANDS DOWN THE BEST GINGER BEEF I HAVE EVER HAD!!! The beef wasn't too crispy and just enough spicy to it that I wasn't downing my drink. I also had the chicken club, which was Delicious! Such large portions for the price you pay. I could not finish all my food.  We had excellent service, our waiter was very friendly and we never had to wait too long to get our drink/food. Our waiter was also very patient with us when it came time to pay as we all wanted to pay separately (and all had had a few drinks as well.)  My only problem with this place is we were seated in the \"red room\" which consist of 2 large hanging red lights, and that's about it. It was very hard to see the menu or even each others faces. But realistically, this did not affect our night out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what keeps luring me back to this delightful venu. Also, I have never been treated with such courtesy by a waiter before in my life. I was ready to propose to the man, but suspected alcohol may have been at work. The martinis are pricey but the indiscriminate drinker can order a 40 in a brown paper bag and feel just as classy. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars as I ordered a veganized pizza (same pizza, no cheese, more vegis) and it was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Ming is one hot place to go for a date.  My husband and I went here on our second date and it was super romantic.  A huge list of fabulous cocktails and a great appetizer menu make for a perfect night out.    It is also a great place for a girls nite out.  Hardly any other bars or lounges in Calgary have such a great ambience.  My favourite thing to order is a glass of Champagne for something like $5.99 and an order of Sweet Potato Fries! Perfectly light snack and my absolute favourite thing to drink.    The theme of the restaurant is Communist which I think is hilarious and makes for a great underground bar.  Their mini patios are great for people watching and on a hot summer night you feel like you are in some tropical city enjoying your Chairman Mao cocktail.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my favourite place to go if fabulous drinks, ambiance and conversational verve are on my menu!  The feel of Ming is sexay reds, yellows and blacks with lots of great lil seating nooks to choose from....if you're there before 9:00 PM. Depend on vulturing for a table thereafter. Yes the decor plays from its namesake but it takes a back seat to feeling comfortable amidst a well-dressed but unpretentious crowd mixed up with slick-lounge tunes played against strange films on the TV screens.  Charmingly named martinis like the mango-flavoured Ghandi, banana-milk-kahlua Jane Goodall or the popular fruity Buddha are fun. I love to infuse myself with the fabulous tequila by ordering the salted non-slushy Zapatista Margarita. Feeling adventurous? Try the Shogun Sour with the South American liquer, Pisco or perhaps an ounce of Absinthe. Or bring out the ghetto in yourself and order a Colt 45 -- I heard they even serve it in a brown paper bag. Drinks are the most modestly priced of any lounge on 17th. Martinis are around the $8.50 mark - reasonable against the $13 you'll pay elsewhere.  The servers have always been pleasant!  The ginger beef at Ming is INFAMOUS and IS fabulous. The yam fries with banana-ketchup are terrific but there's also edamame, dry ribs, spring rolls etc. and you won't be disappointed with their chicken burger or lil flatbread pizzas either.  This is the place I take dates, meet friends at, bring out-of-towners to.  Yes, I really love it that much. *wink* Oh, p.s. If you like independent short films, watch for the Ming Short Film Festival or pop by for celebrations at Chinese New Year."}
{"text":"Great place to come have fun, relax or just enjoy some good food. Owner is great, staff is awesome and music is dope. I would recommend anyone to try this place for a casual get together or if you want an night out."}
{"text":"I think Ming is a great lounge - \"have a drink and chill out\" venue. The ambience about it is very unique, and hard to find in Calgary. The layout is somewhat \"e\" shaped, but it gives great variety for your sitting options :) You can sit close to the front door, and see the action on 17th ave, or you can venture off further and sit deep inside ming, tucked away from any distractions. They even have a red light room with a few tables, that can be closed off with huge curtains...definately a nice choice to have a few drinksand have a little make out session withouth anyone ever noticing a thing, in between. Love the music, love the staff, love the drinks. Perhaps I wish the pricing was a little lighter..but then I guess I would be asking for too much, of a place that already gives so much ;)"}
{"text":"It's the commie bar! Nice setup, cool lighting, and the drink list is extensive. I never had any of the food, however. Service is grande and the music is at a volume conducive to interaction! A bit pricy which is funny considering it's a commie bar... Or does communism make everything market-based expensive? I don't remember.."}
{"text":"If you have a political sense of humour, this place will leave you smiling. Located in 17th Ave, we found Ming on Yelp. The part that brought us into the door? A communist Bar! Nothing could be more amusing. They have a fabulous variety of cocktails in their \"Manifesto\" including The Churchhill, The Dali Lama, Ghandi and my absolute favourite: Harvey Lee Oswald. Between the awesomely named drinks, you might find yourself into the middle of a socio-historical conversation as tho you were still studying in university.   Socialist, Marxist or Capitalist, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Ming is very cool. It's the bar with a faux communist theme and several Iconic (and ironic) drink names. The banana Ketchup served with your fries is odd but worth trying and their cocktails are served in everything from tiki heads to coconuts. The drinks are expensive but loaded with creativity and alcohol so worth it every now and then.   Here's a fun game: When I go I enjoy counting the beards of the patrons because no other bar has a higher percentage   Vash√© zdorov'ye comrade!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has a real lounge bar feel to it, and it's unfortunately been fairly quiet whenever I have been here (although that's been late on Mondays and Tuesdays). I kind of like that though, as you can have your own space and actually have a conversation! They have a great cocktail list, with lots of options with fresh lime. Once I came here and chose anything that listed lime and they were all super tasty. They also have table service, and the service is always great. The first time we were pretty much the only people there and so the server (who I think might have been the manager) was really chatty which we really enjoyed. I really like the decor, there's a small fireplace as you walk in and then lots of booths and lounge areas to choose from, with tables lit up in red. The boots could be more comfortable, but I still like the layout more than a lot of bars that only have stools or cafe style chairs. Even the bathrooms have an Asian theme to them, I can't remember what the sayings are on the bathroom doors for guys and girls but they always make me smile."}
{"text":"first stumbled across ming on a chilly monday night   the fieplace in the lounge area next to the bar was a welcome sight   the friendly russian bartender Lisa  advised me that on mondays they have a special on  liquor - therefore i had a vodka on the rocks - a very friendly little enclave on 17th  with some interesting decor of the cold war  i said cheers to mao se tung whose portrait was hangling above the fireplace   as Arnold swchartzenager said \" ill be back \""}
{"text":"I love Ming for its dark and edgy vibe. It's in a really great location on 17th ave, which makes it a perfect stop along the way while you're bar hopping.  The drink menu is awesome. They name their drinks after political leaders which I find pretty cute. My favorite is Boutros Boutros - essentially just a chocolate martini but delicious. Food is pretty good too if you need to snack on something. A little overpriced, but that's what you get for a bar sitting in a prime downtown location.  My only beef with this place is their service. I don't let this issue weigh too heavily on my enjoyment of the place though because I go in expecting shitty service now so I can let it slide half the time and their drinks and atmosphere are too cool to ignore.  The servers take forever getting to your table and I find them pretty snotty half the time, where they'll just blatantly ignore your table if they don't like the look of you. One time I was there and the waitress walked by our table of 5 people multiple times before taking our drink order. I had to literally stand up and stop her in her tracks to ask if we were going to get served at all that night because we had seriously waited 20 min. We weren't even hidden in the back corner, we were in plain view sitting in front of the fireplace by the bar.  So, if you're in the mood for some cocktails and a good atmosphere I'd definitely recommend this place. Just don't go in expecting any great service from the staff."}
{"text":"We just spent over $100 on food which is sooooo gross! There's a chance they changed the chef perhaps? Totally not worth eating in this place!! Terrible food! Simply disgusting   Ambience & drinks are good though."}
{"text":"You'll be hard pressed to find someone in Calgary that doesn't love Ming.  The martinis are the best in town and the atmosphere is second to none. If you get yourself a table, then plan on staying all night.  The drinks are that good.  I'm taking a single star away because of their terribly small bathrooms.  Yes, bathrooms are a re-occurring theme in my reviews because I think they are so important.  And Ming's bathrooms are some of the worst. Sure they are relatively clean, but they are the size of tiny closet.  If two people are in there it somehow starts to feel like a 70's bathhouse.  Not my sorta thing.     But if you have a bladder of steel, you'll love Ming!"}
{"text":"Very good Martini and Cocktail selections, the place is too dark to read the menus and the men's washroom was tight and small. Services was okay though."}
{"text":"Ming is one of my all-time favourite hangouts on 17th Ave.  The atmosphere is sultry, dark, mysterious and inviting. In fact, when I was living in Toronto, I found a restaurant that had the EXACT same vibe & layout. For all you Torontonians, Ming has the SAME vibe & feel as The Queen Mother Cafe on Queen Street West. No, Ming does not serve Pad Thai, but boy do they make mean martinis! I'll admit I've never actually eaten here, but their food looks tempting! Everything from Zucchini sticks, to pot stickers, to sweet potato fries! And yes ladies...they have chocolate lava cake. *Drool*  If I had to describe why I like Ming so much, I could sum it up by saying that it is THE perfect 1st date spot. The lighting sets the mood, the drinks ease the conversation, and the seating ensures that you've got an excuse to sit a little too close to your new friend.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ming is quite the unique place. Atmosphere-wise, it's got a cozy late-night-lounge feel to it. There is a bit of a Communist theme to it, and this is reflected not only in their menu (with sections like \"Primary Agenda\" and \"Processions\"), but also in the decor (with pictures of different Communist dictators on the walls). They have some amazing cocktails on their menu, and their ginger beef is what they are known for - it is so very good!  I had come here for a Yelp event, but just had to come back to try out their full menu and experience it outside of an event. So I came here with my girlfriend, and they didn't disappoint.  I don't recall what cocktail I had (unfortunately they don't list them online to be able to go through and figure that out either). For food, I had their Ginger Beef and a Chicken Club sandwich. Their ginger beef is not overly spicy, but it is chock full of ginger, and full of flavor. The club sandwich was not anything overly special, but it was quite tasty.  I will forewarn though - if for some reason you are sensitive to red light, you won't like this place. Their bathrooms have nothing but red lights in them, which is a really weird when you first get into them, and takes some time to adjust.   Otherwise, it is a great place, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So after my boyfriend and I escaped Vinyl, we drove to Ming because we needed to gather our wits and dignity in a more civilized environment.  It was around 1 am that we arrived here and there was quite a few tables available, thankfully. So we went to the alcove-ish area and got a table. Ming felt like heaven at that point because exactly half an hour earlier I was at Vinyl, and saying that a tacky underage club lit up with tacky blue lights is not my scene would be the understatement of the millenium.    Anyway, our server floated to us like an angel in heaven and informed us that the kitchen was open, which was music to our ears because we were hungry. We promptly ordered a pizza and 2 drinks. My cocktail was a tasty concoction of pineapple, coconut, vanilla and lime juice. We sunk into the deep couches and bathed in the red glowing light and felt sane again. The pizza arrived, we dove in, and I savoured every bite of it. THIS was exactly my scene. And apparently my boyfriend's too, because he commented more than once that he liked 'this place'. Chill music which lets you have a conversation, an ambiance second-to-none, delicious affordable drinks, and a kitchen that stays open late - Thank you for existing, Ming.   And thank you for salvaging what was left of our Saturday night. We can't wait to be back.   26/30"}
{"text":"November Challenge - 23/30  What! I haven't reviewed Ming yet?! I love Ming, and their cocktails named after famous rulers and dictators. How can I say no to a martini named after Noriega, that has banana liqueur and pop rocks on the rim?   Well, maybe I'll say no on a first date, because I'd rather not have that dude's first impression of me; be of me fellating the pop rocks off the rim on a martini glass.   But if I'm with friends? Noriegas, ahoy!  Love their pepper potato wedges too, and their edamame has just the right amount of seasoning. I don't think I've ever encountered a drink I didn't like at Ming (the Marie Antoinette martini is delicious, too!), and service is always on point. The server I had on my last visit was an awesome lady."}
{"text":"Love Ming.  Funny bartenders, a great variety of drinks, and delicious food.   I hear there will be gay Mondays? So excited!"}
{"text":"Ming you jazzy old broad, I'll never get tired of your dictator themed cocktails. The second last time I was here, some poet laureate berated me for drinking a whiskey sour because it was a feminine drink. Who gives a @#*@%#? Anything that's named Shogun is far from being anything feminine, asshole.  Nothing gets the night going like a good Chairman Mao and Karl Marx. Just saying.  I got their grilled cheese sandwich. TWAS a cheesy delight. But my friends didn't seem too happy with their food orders. Someone didn't get garlic on their bread, which nearly caused a huge uprising. And my friend's stomach got assaulted by their pizza.  The vibe of this place is great. Meeting up here with friends early in the night leaves you with the option of staying and enjoying conversation while watching cool kung fu flicks, or venturing off into the night to do gawd-knows-wut..."}
{"text":"Nice spot to get a drink and food - esp. if you want to have a conversation. Lots of choices in cocktails and beer. I ate the clubhouse sandwich - it was huge. Instead of bread - they used flatbread. Lots of fresh, chopped up lettuce, bacon and chicken. It wasn't overly sauced up or greasy. The side of fries were amazing - nice to have option of chipotle or dill dip. I really enjoyed the Red Mile burger - it was super juicy and very flavourful. I saw some people order ginger beef - it smelled and looked good. Seem to be the place to bring a first date. I found the bar a bit too dark for me - I was worried I would trip over something. There is an awesome private room too - would be nice to host a small party at Ming."}
{"text":"Crystal H chose Ming for us as a happy hour pit stop based on their Yelp reviews. Score one in Calgary for Yelp and for Crystal.  When I sat in Ming sipping my glass of bubbly I felt like I was somehow involved in a covert operation. I mean this in the absolute best way, too. The rooms are dim, with red-hued lights and feel very sexy. The seats huddle around tables making you lean in, as if to tell secrets. The TVs show old movies to distract would-be listeners from overhearing your secrets. If there were any other people around at all that is.  And for all you non-spy people, or people who don't have an overactive imagination like me this spot is awesome for plain old happy hour drinks, too. Besides the cozy interior they have quite a lovely patio to enjoy the short summer days. The service was super, super friendly and the drink menu magnificent. All good things in my book."}
{"text":"What an excellent little bar!  I'm going to write a longer more detailed review later but for now I will give you some bullet point highlights:  -- Communist theme: Red, pictures of Our Great Leader, manifestos,  -- Chic atmosphere; part club like, part bar, areas for private conversations and areas to rally the troops! -- Amazing cocktail menu. I tried the Trotsky, the Lee Harvey Oswald, the Karl Marx - Awesome staff with PERSONALITY who enjoy their jobs - Great food (our table tried the shinning pathway flatbread, the Veggi burger, and mixed greens. All great..  Check this place out for something unique and different on 17th Ave!"}
{"text":"The drinks were decent, service was disappointing. We got into Ming for drinks when the place was not busy, and still found the service to be spotty. Also, I liked two out of three of the martinis I had, but found one of the martinis incredibly bitter. Note that my waitress insisted on charging me for the undrinkable martini. I can't speak to the restaurant as I didn't eat, so please check out the other reviews on that front."}
{"text":"At one time this establishment was THE cocktail lounge, not only in Calgary but perhaps North America. A brash statement perhaps but for those of us who were here at Ming conception and have since moved on to other countries and pastimes there was nothing quite like this \"home\". What lured me in originally to Ming? Steve Ming had been opened for a month, and I had read in the National Post he was refusing to allow anyone in his bar during Stampede week if they were wearing a cowboy hat. Thought to myself now that's my kind of bar. That was 1995.  I moved away from Calgary in 2012 but came back to visit this Christmas. Went to Ming and sadly....what was once the hottest girl in school is now a middle aged soccer mom who drives a Ford Taurus. We all get old I know but that doesn't mean you have to give up."}
{"text":"I love this place. nice clean, classy, great seating, awesome music, friendly staff. They have a cool list of drinks with awesome names!  Great relaxing place to hang out and have a drink. I would recommend this to friends family and bosses."}
{"text":"Ming is a great place to visit for cocktails and/or a late-night dinner. We went on a Monday night so it was pretty dead, with just a few tables taken. The drinks at Ming are delish - we had one that was meant to share between two people and found it quite flavourful (I'd try to find the name but I find the website hard to navigate and the drink menu is nowhere to be seen).  I had the spicy chicken stirfry dish over jasmine rice. It could have been a lot spicier - since there was a non-spicy option (teryaki) they definitely could have added a few peppers to the spicy sauce. But there was lots of chicken and the veggies were fresh & massive so all in all it was a great meal, plus I took some home and ate it for lunch the next day!  While leaving, we saw that tables near the front were taken up by a bunch of people who definitely knew eachother and the venue staff. Obviously a 'neighbourhood hangout' for a lot of people - which I didn't expect from this establishment. Kind of cool.  I'd definitely visit Ming again.  (20/30)"}
{"text":"awesome place....we got the funkiest spots in the bar.    We were all up on the fire place and the chairs were hands with big fingers as the backing.  We were in the the palm of their hand - not sure who's hand, but in the palm.    At first the fire, was a little too hot  - the waitress (super friendly and noticed our slight discomfort immediately) reached INTO the fireplace and turned it down - AWESOME (she got a big tip).    Drinks were strong and arrived quickly...the bar was basked in red and we had a massive picture of Mao and a cool sculpture deal(in Gold) of Budhha.  Vibe was really great - music was mostly lounge-like (house) and not too loud.     Once you go into the back the place really opens up with more booth like tables (again, all red) and looked super comfy.  We had 12 drinks and got out of there of $70, what a steal...  Not super crowded, not cowboy hats, and right on17th street with lots of other street action to take in.  I will return when I visit the YYC again"}
{"text":"I got fooled by the reviews.This is nowhere near the best Ginger Beef in the city. Sauce not right and was soggy. You guys need to try Bills Peking house or even Ginger Beef house in Coventry Hills. No taste!"}
{"text":"Hello Communist Bar! I love edgy lounges with great drinks and tongue-in-cheek humour about political ideologies. I think the dim lighting and subtle red glow of the bar scare a lot of people, but that's cool because the place is pretty full anyways.  There is a great atmosphere of like-minded individuals who want to enjoy some good cocktails, look pretty and celebrate the culturedness. Ming is undoubtedly the place to be cultured in Calgary, what with having it's own manifesto AND film festivals. This place has it all folks, without the pretension or condescension that often accompany it.  The menu is great, and my personal favourite is definitely the delicious yam fries with spicy banana ketchup. Yum! Their drink menu is both extensive and hilarious. The cocktails are all named after people, and though they are expensive they pack a pretty punch. My favourite favourite is the Buddha, and I always try a new one when I'm there. Unfortunately, sometimes I get duped by the cocktail names (Who doesn't want a Lenin cocktail?) and get a drink that isn't quite to my tastes. I've never had a bad cocktail, but I've definitely tried ones that aren't for me. That's the pleasure of the place: they live up to one communist ideal by providing a haven that appeals to a multitude of tastes. Yes, that does mean Colt 45 in a paper bag.  Service has ranged from mediocre to stupendous depending on both servers and time of day, and generally falls into the \"really good\" category. Ming is a great place to get the night started, and is truly welcoming to all people."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I never would've thought to pop in here for food if it wasn't for a friend that owns the place. The menu items are really tasty!! Tako yaki balls are really tasty. Their ribs are delicious. The service is phenomenal. Come here for some good Asian fusion pub food!!"}
{"text":"Decided to \"Ming\" it tonight, after reading so many good yelp reviews about the place.  The exterior is deceiving, it seems small but what it opens up to is in fact a very large place with lots of seating and great ambiance.  The handrails are metal bamboo, and there are plasma TVs and Buddhas throughout.  The red communist party vibe is alive and kicking here.  There is a nice portrait of Mao over the toasty fireplace, where I decided to sit in the palm of a giant shaped hand.  I was immediately greeted by a friendly waitress who quickly adapted the cocktail menu to a coffee drink because I needed something hot.  My delicious drink managed to come quickly but my friend hadn't yet so I took this time to peruse the cocktail menu: Buddha, Shogun Sour, Norma Jean, Mother Theresa, Che Guevara, Kahuna Manifesto, Napoleon, Ghandi, etc.  I was just about to leave but then my friend came bursting through the doors.  Wanting to try another area we decided on a more private space of red lighted tables that made me feel like I was in an Egoyan movie.  Here we settled for some yam fries.  These were tasty but a bit disappointing for me in size for the price.  In fact I found all the appetizers to be a little overpriced.  All in all definitely a nice place to unwind or to maybe coalition in large groups to form a new political party.  If not, then certainly a perfect place for a first date."}
{"text":"I adore Ming!!! Back in my hay days I would go to Ming for all my first dates. It's fun, interesting, and has a really cozy intimate feel to it. It's small so sometimes it's hard to find a table, but I love the ambience and the obscure movies they're always playing on the TV's. The servers are always really friendly, the menu is cool (drinks named after communists...love it), and the food is wonderful. GET THE GINGER BEEF, you will not be disappointed! I also love how they serve a Colt 45 in a paper bag, I would never get it but I think it's hilarious. The last time my boyfriend and I went late-night and we had a really cute table by the fireplace, super romantic. Ming is awesome!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I headed over to Ming last night, after having a good time at last month's Yelp Elite event. We thought it'd be pretty busy on a Saturday night, but we actually had no problem finding a prime table, situated right next to a framed picture of Mr. Joseph Stalin.  I have never really been a cocktail lady, preferring microbrew beer most of the time, but the names are so charming, I couldn't resists. Upon giggling at the names and combinations, and stuck between a few including The Trotsky and The Chairman Mao, I eventually settled for the timeless Karl Marx, a simple vodka (although at Ming, the vodka drinks you), blue curacao, and Sprite. Actually, I eventually settled for a few of those, and a stolen liquor soaked lychee from my lovely and tolerant friend's Chairman Mao.  We also shared some sweet potato fries, which were just fine indeed.  I was not too charmed by the dim, red loungey lighting and the most awkwardly constructed bathrooms ever,  but such is life, I suppose.  I will be back to Ming when I'm in the market for some more $10 cocktails, and to make some Communist puns. :)"}
{"text":"The decor is actually shoddy, and kitschy. The bathrooms are filthy. Typical Calgary, it's a dive that somehow purports itself as a classy establishment to self-justify its exorbitant drink prices.  Yet, Ming is a good place. Why?   First: Deep-down, Ming knows it's a dirty swill-hole, thus, the staff is extremely friendly. The doorman doesn't treat you like a piece of garbage that's blown in off the street.   Second: The staff can mix a drink that's not on the menu. They can actually take instruction. This alone places Ming above the majority of bars in Calgary.  Third: The gin martinis are great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place isn't busier. It's the best Chinese I've had in town. Been here 4 years now.  Pro tip. Order the beef and broccoli. Get your own, you won't want to share."}
{"text":"I like Ming, but I am not in love with it...   It has a certain cheekiness, with interesting decor and drink names, and the service is quite good, but there are better options on 17th...  I think it is a great place to duck in for a quick drink around 730pm, after dinner and before going out. It's small and dark and has low ceilings, makes me feel a little claustrophobic....  Check it out for yourself kids!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from Ming on several occasions. If I could give a 3.5 rating I would. It's consistently average with the two above average dishes being the Salt and Pepper Calamari and their Ginger Beef. The prices are very reasonable as well, especially their 3 dishes for $30 deal. I'm sure I will have some more late night orders from them in the future."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food!! I don't know what was better!!! Everything we had was amazing!! For appetizers we had the octopus and it was great! The spring rolls were really good too!! For main courses we ordered 4 dishes to share, noodles, shrimp, veggies and the beef... I still can't tell which one I like better !! All were excellent!! And the size of the food was very appropriate! The wine was not bad and the place had a good ambience! Definitely nothing to complain! This is now one of my favourite places for Asian food in Calgary! I would love to go back there soon!!"}
{"text":"Um.... A communist themed bar on a subzero Calgary evening? Obviously. Part kitsch/part throwback to the days of loungey chic before gastro pubs conquered the universe. There is a thorough martini menu with theme named drinks. We tried 3 of them, and they were pretty good... And stiff. The Asian fusion cuisine was decent but nothing to brag about. The star attraction here is the bizarre theme and eclectic patrons it attracts, from tatted hipsters to the young, pretty, and chic. If I lived in the neighborhood, I probably would not be a regular. Definitely a place you have to check out once, though. When you do, have a Lee Harvey Oswald for me."}
