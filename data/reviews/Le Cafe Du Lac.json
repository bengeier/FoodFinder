{"text":"Total disappointment! Was looking forward to going there based on the reviews. Basically was ignored by the counter person once we got there. Yes they were busy but the customer service is totally lacking. Menu has plenty to offer but nothing worth getting, won't try again that's for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. we ordered the avocado panini which is open faced.  It's a slice of bread topped with basil olive oil, avocados, onions, feta cheese, crushed red pepper and a poached egg.  It was to die for. We also got the La Nordique, which is a crepe with smoked salmon and fresh cream and it was flavorful.  Before we left we got a couple of chocolate almond croissants and a few macaroons.  Everything tasted great and was home made which makes this place very unique and amazing.  They are doing a great job and I hope they continue to do so."}
{"text":"Drove 40 minutes to try this place out and it was worth it! Great brunch place with a beautiful view of the lake. My husband and I got the Galette La Nordique and La Complete; BOTH WERE DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"The pastries were stale, very stale!   This place is out of the way... way out of the way... my husband insisted to go because he knows I miss French pastries and after he read the glowing reviews here he thought doing something nice for me.  What a huge disappointment!!!  There was just a few pastries left in the window and we bought some to go. Arrived at our hotel, we found out they were stale, very stale. Not a bit stale from this morning but rock hard stale from at least yesterday.   We have a microwave at the hotel so we warmed them up to \"tenderize\" them but we just had a small bite. My husband commented they were the worse he ever had, and I agree.   The rest I bought will be tossed as I do not want to be sick but it's a real shame.  The pasties must have been fresh at some point but not today. I am mad to have driven 1 hour round trip and to have spent a fait amount of money for un-eatable products that ended up in the waste bin.  If I was the owner of this place, I would be mortified to stand behind that. I will never even consider going back there."}
{"text":"Such a great little place.... great ambiance ... owner was very nice and welcoming.. beautiful view of Lake Las Vegas. The food was fantastic... like really really yummy! We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Had a sweet 16 brunch and it was perfect. The service was delightful and the food was lovely."}
{"text":"Tried this cafe for breakfast yesterday and ended up going back again today.  The pastries are authentic french, great coffee and the menu had something for everyone. The avocado panini (avocado toast) was delicious.  My husband loved the gallettes.  The salad lyonnais was simple and properly executed,  just like i prefer.  This is soon to be my go-to for lunch with girlfriends as well as my go-to weekend breakfast.  Btw, they have Perrier Jouet by the glass or priced reasonably by the bottle.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Enjoyed the food, coffee, and setting!  A must if In lake Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great location at Lake Las Vegas! It's right on the waterfront, indoor/outdoor seating & very nice view. It is a very cute & cozy cafe for breakfast & lunch. The pastries are delicious and fresh! I had a few pastries and strawberry & nut crepe. It was a great experience and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing find!  Highly recommended.  The staff is friendly and very accommodating.  We went for an early breakfast with kids.  We sat outside overlooking the lake.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Best pastries we've ever tasted outside of Paris.  Especially the Pain du Chocolat (chocolate croissant).  We also had their almond croissant, avocado toast and açaí berry bowl.  Best and freshest food we've had.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Man, best breakfast I've had in a long tine. The service could be improved a bit but the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cafe right on the lake.  We keep coming back, have been here three times this week (so far!).  The Miel et citron crepe is to die for.  My wife really enjoys both the watermelon salad and the butter lettuce salad.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday morning and enjoyed some of the best pastries.  We enjoyed the scenic view and great service.  Our crepe took longer than expected but that was a minor inconvenience.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite morning breakfast and coffee experience! An amazing view of the Lake while smiling your way through freshly cooked treats. Their Avocado Panini is what I typically lead towards, however all of the pastries have been wonderful, along with the galettes! After reading the other reviews, I must comment on the nature of them-- customers open the doors to come in and employees open the doors to serve their happy customers. This means that flies are able to sneak in. (Of course they do, it smells amazing in there). The alternative? A fly zapper in the corner (EW), a sticky fly trap hanging from the ceiling (EW), or an employee hired particularly to swat bugs while you eat (EW). I don't find a couple flies unbearable and definitely wouldn't knock my review on a place based on nature being nature. Also, I am willing to wait an extra minute for customer service if a business is busy. These employees are only human and they are doing a dang good job fulfilling all of our needy and hangry needs. I wouldn't change a dang thing here and I hope that those who have yet to try it, will check it out and those who had a bad experience, give it another chance."}
{"text":"Unreal find. My wife and I couldn't find a good place to go eat on way to the lake - until this French gem popped up. Seriously / haven't been to a French bakery/cafe this authentic and good and picturesque EVER. GOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, How sweet the sound!   It was adventure time with lucky Lauren.  She mentioned we try a French bakery at Lake Las Vegas.  Of course I'm always on board for a new place.  The main windows of the cafe face the lake near the water sports rental area.  The inside has a handful of tables for 2 or 4.  It did happen to get very busy during the lunch hour but they have their majority of seating on the patio for their customers. The friendly staff made us feel right at home.  Very attentive and accommodating from all!  My eyes widened when I saw the fresh pastries all lined up.  The Almond Croissant melted in my mouth touching every taste bud.  The almond filling as well as the sliced almonds on top gave this fresh and light pastry my high approval.    Of course the pastries weren't the only options we chose.  We split the Croque Monsieur, Mushroom & Swiss Galette and La Poire Crepe.  Sounds like a lot right? It was but totally worth every calorie.  We watched from our table as they made the crepe and galette. Perfectly done each with an amazing decadence.  The Croque Monsieur is always a favorite to order.  I'm a sucker for béchamel.  It was layered in the the ham and swiss that put a smile on my face.   What can I say.  I love French Bakeries and Le Cafe Du Lac is great!"}
{"text":"It is so nice to have this wonderful cafe as an addition to the village.  A warm, friendly and genuine welcome as we walked in the door.  The berry iced tea was so refreshing on this hot and humid day.  The chicken sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious--a \"Must-try\"!!! Amazing tasty menu from the delicious turkey melt panini to the authentic pain au chocolate croissants, homemade banana & Nutella crepes (just like those in Paris!), and the real-deal croquet madame. We will be back for the galettes, quiche, avacado toast and more! Friendly service, great value, picturesque view of the lake, dog-friendly outdoor seating. Our new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing!! The food is off the chart, great Little French place and the quality of the food is amazing.. Erin is super sweet.. will come back again!"}
{"text":"For a moment you might feel like you're at a cafe on the streets of Paris when you look across scenic Lake Las Vegas as you sit and enjoy a meal at Le Cafe Du Lac. I had originally intended on visiting for the crepes, but the selection of pastries drew my nose closer and the daily specials were too mouthwatering to pass up. The salmon toast was a special this day and special it was. Almost too pretty to eat, what I thought would be a snack, left me feeling rather full. Everything tasted fresh and the pastries were warm and flaky. The drink selection was not ideal, I ordered an iced tea initially that was not very good, replaced with an iced americano which would have been better had they not been out of cream. We came in probably 20 minutes before closing after a large group of athletes had been training and competing at the lake all day. All in all, I'm more than glad I made the choice to stop in and check out this cute little place."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Saturday. It was okay. Very friendly service. Cozy cafe feel.  A bit uncomfortable with how many flies were in there buzzing around and landing on the pastries. Hopefully, they get that taken care of somehow.  We had a couple of buckwheat galettes that tasted good.  Overall, you'll probably have a pleasant experience here. Especially, if they take care of their fly problem."}
{"text":"We visit the lakes regularly when we come see my parents. Stopped by for some breakfast and got the ham quiche and zucchini quiche. Both are personal sized and rich in flavor. The ingredients are quality and my husband and I were satisfied. Also ordered a madeleines, strawberry tart, and almond chocolate croissant. Again, ingredients are rich and fresh. Their hot chocolate is not too sweet and the coffee is quality. Customer service was great here and they put together my order fast. There was a huge group of people who came in with their kids and even through that chaos they took my order first and got me out of there fast."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a cute tiny cafe.   Everything was perfect! I love the atmosphere, the view of the lake, their crepes, desserts and the customer service was on point!  My kids are very picky and they ended up liking this place, if they eat I definitely approve!  It's worth the 30-40 minutes drive, I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Place is amazing ! After kayaking, my friend and I went for drink and dessert as we needed some fuel before we drive back to the strip. We ordered this ice coffee something drink, Stella beer, chocolate twist and madeleine. Tastes great! It's clean and workers are nice. I didn't know but they close at 3pm but they didn't kick us out. My friend and i sat inside so they started to clean up outside quietly without giving us hints to hurry up and get out! We left at 3:15pm and they were still cleaning up outside. I took one star out... because the worker informed me that the beer won't be cold bc they just put in the refrigerator ten min ago... but the worker already opened the bottle and set on the table... shouldn't he told me that when I ordered and suggest to get different beer? Who drinks warm beer... at 100F! He gave me a cup with ice.... overall, I will still come to this place and recommend to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"For a small French cafe out at Lake Las Vegas they serve good French cafe food.  When we are out there we stop in and order food and take some to go as well.  The quiche,sandwiches, hot chocolate, macaroons and madeleines are what draws us in."}
{"text":"Have crepes which are also available gluten free!. Coffee, rosé is a great way to start ur day.  Has beautiful view of the Lake.  Yummy pastries."}
{"text":"The Galette is something really different and delicious. You can't go wrong, doesn't matter which add-on  you choose. Try it , you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We got the avocado toast with feta cheese, and it was delicious. The place is beautiful, the stuff is really nice too. Overall it was a great experience. And we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic. The cafe has a beautiful view of the lake also. Our food was a bit delayed so we were given some treats to hold us over. Amazing!"}
{"text":"A quaint nice French cafe away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. It was a nice getaway for my birthday. I ordered the turkey melt and it was delicious. The cafe had a variety of pastries and they looked divine! My siblings ordered Nutella banana crepe and they loved it! So glad we came here and spent a few hours to just relax and enjoy each other's company. definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing ! If you want a little taste of Paris you definitely need to try this awesome cafe ! From breakfast to lunch and if you have a sweet tooth please don't hesitate to order a French crêpe ,There wonderful ! The owner owners are very friendly and treat you very well . I love trying out small places like this one especially if the owner is hands on ! You can't go wrong . Oh and if your a pet lover your more then welcome to bring them out with you and enjoy a great morning or noon outside patio over looking the lake .. food is delicious and great staff to accommodate your needs . Very pleased and would recommend all to try this place . Just don't get impatient if it take a few minutes longer . It's well worth the wait ! Thank you Le Cafe Du Lac !"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for breakfast.   Good service, good food and beautiful location.   The place is not busy.  In fact the area is too quiet."}
{"text":"Found this place while wondering around Lake Las Vegas.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Try the crapes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stayed at the Hilton at Lake Las Vegas and wandered over here for breakfast one morning. I ordered the La Poire crepes, they were so delicious! My husband really enjoyed what he ordered as well- the croissant egg sandwich. (The couple after us added bacon to their croissant sandwich and he wished he had done the same! It looked so yummy.) The portions are European style (smaller) but that is something we like. The cafe was very cute and the staff was all very friendly and attentive. Each person asked us if we were enjoying our food, and the waiter came to check on us many times throughout our meal. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cute French cafe. We unfortunately didn't get to try any of the pastries but they looked very good and there was a large variety."}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich, one of the best I have ever had. The sauce is so good.  The quiches are also very good. Highly recommend this place. Right on the lake as well. Beer and wine."}
{"text":"Small, cute place to grab breakfast/brunch. Croissants were extremely flaky and fresh. Lady who took our order was super friendly and ready to answer any and all questions that we had. Food was fresh and nice sized portions, wasn't overpriced either. Conveniently located right by the water. Not disappointed and will be back when in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Perfect for having a coffee and reading the paper or a nice meal lakeside.  Without doubt the best casual french bistro in Las Vegas. I was there last week and definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic setting with view of Lake Las Vegas and delicious food! We enjoyed the La Galette Complete with egg, ham and guyuere cheese. Two mochas and fresh OJ too!  The service from Carmen, one of the co-owners, was very personalized and friendly."}
{"text":"We saw all these reviews so we came to try it . I'm so disappointed. Sizes of the croisants so small for 2.65$ coffee was not good at all for 3.25 by the way about the flies I totally agree . They need to do something with that we set in side and it's still same thing . We had croissant egg sandwich was not good my cousin had a juice half of cup was filled and my auntie had a blueberry tart in a plate that it's chipped and I don't think that look professional"}
{"text":"Really nice little cafe to get coffee, relax, eat, and people watch. Compared to the other establishments, I believe they know what they are doing and offer a lot of flavorful and good food. If you are ver in the Lake Las Vegas area give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Unbelievable crepes, galette, panini, croissants, quiche and then some. Happiness in my mouth!"}
{"text":"We were waiting for a great coffee place, fantastic and professional service, delicious croissants and crepes, and we got it all."}
{"text":"This place is inside the market at lake Las Vegas . It's a French place , very authentic ! They bake everything there , so it's so fresh . Very cute inside , with plenty of outside seating . They have lots of lattes and coffee to choose from."}
{"text":"Excellent and a great momentary respite from everything.  The food was great and we were completely thrilled by the quality!  I was extremely hesitant because I had been to Lake Mead, and assumed that the restaurant was near a similar stagnant body of water with a marginalized quality of service to match.    WRONG!    The lake front area was beautiful, the air was full of wonderful scents and sounds from the lake that was right in front of the restaurant, everything was clean and clear.    THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!    We were admittedly hungry, but the crepe du jour was impeccable, the cheese sandwich was divine, the simple salads were wonderful.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This French cafe is a little hidden gem in Lake Las Vegas. You will love the Quiche Lorraine and the Galettes. Everything is fresh and made to perfection. I highly recommend checking out this cafe :-)"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the Lake Las Vegas area.  This is a cozy Cafe located by the lake serves fresh baked pastries and an array of sweet crepes, savory and hot sandwiches, along with other dishes like salad.  The food is delicious and well worth it!  We ordered a several dishes which were all very satisfying. The bacon on the galette was nice and crispy.  The croissants were buttery and flaky. I really enjoyed the almond and chocolate croissant.  Overall had a pleasant experience. My only concern was that the door was open and there were flies in the cafe. There should be a way to cover the pastries so they don't get contaminated. There's outside seating but the flies were flying all over."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast experience w my Mom! Had the croque madam and my mom thoroughly enjoyed her bacon quiche and chai latte."}
{"text":"What a great little café in Lake Las Vegas! Bethany E. and I struck gold with this one when looking for a new spot to have lunch. Previous to visiting I had no idea a cute French bakery existed in Lake Las Vegas.  The café is very cute and cozy. There are seven or eight tables inside and more tables outside. We chose to eat inside, but if I visited earlier in the day I'd definitely sit outside.   The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We arrived at the same time as a large group and many apologies were made for the \"wait\", but really they handled the rush well. Service was quick despite the rush. We were checked on several times. Someone even came over to clear our plates when they saw we were staying to chat a bit.  We tried a variety of items and I truly loved them all!  Almond Croissant- light, flaky and had almond paste to give it that over the top delicious almond taste Canele- this was my first time having this particular pastry, it was spongey and had maybe a slight orange flavor Croque Monsieur- yum! perfectly crunchy bread with plenty of ham, swiss, and béchamel sauce, loved that everything was inside of the sandwich so it wasn't messy to eat Mushroom & Swiss Galette- the buckwheat crepe was delicious and crispy, loved the flavor of the galette overall La Poire Crepe- the crepe was delicious with a delicious filling and perfectly poached pear on top  Loved this spot and will definitely be back, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! They advertise Nutella crepes, but it was obviously not Nutella. It looked like a watered down version of Hershey's syrup. My mushroom quiche looked previously frozen and was plopped on my plate with no sauce and a poor excuse of a side salad with just baby greens thrown from the bag onto my plate. My kids said the chocolate milk tasted like water and syrup. Not worth a penny and not French at all!"}
{"text":"GOOD Located in Lake Las Vegas right near the water sports shop and boat dock.  It's October so the weather is beautiful to sit outside and enjoy the view.  The place is located on the corner  Mimosas are a must outside...  The crepes range from sweet to savory.  The poulet with buckwheat is what I had. The chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection (see pic)   The Poire crepe prob a new favorite...the pear is delicious and balances so well with the  chocolate Grenache and toasted pecans.  4 of us had to sample it!  BAD  If your expecting sit down service in the am and wanting a rush meal.  This is not for you it's lake  Las Vegas enjoy yourself and the view.    You order then pick an open table. I guess this isn't a bad.  Just letting people know what to expect...  P.s. owner is former chef at Guy Savoy...need I say more."}
{"text":"Great quiet retreat to enjoy a fantastic cappuccino and any of their great sandwiches. They also have a good selection of pastries worth over indulging in. It can get crowded at times since many locals love this place. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Being at Lake Las Vegas, the view is lovely, especially when sitting on the patio. The pan au chocolat was very fresh, and my dining partner enjoyed the coffee saying it was smooth and robust. He's kind of a coffee snob and was very pleased with this one. The croque monsieur and the breakfast croissant sandwich (with added ham) were delicious. Staff was very pleasant and courteous. French accents to boot! Dining by the lake is always a good idea."}
{"text":"Amazing place to have breakfast or brunch with absolute gorgeous view. I had tried Salad Du Lac which was so delicious, light and very refreshing in the middle of the summer. Coffee was just right, not too strong  with beautiful flavor. Almond croissant was one the best I have ever tried. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"They had me at \"hello\". The Cafe has fabulous food and the atmosphere is truly charming.  The food is made with fresh ingredients and the chef really knows what he is doing....   Thank you for giving us such a great place to eat!  I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and location, but: I was wsiting long time to order, maybe owners need to improve their system...kind of chaos, kitchen inside, crepes outside, staff here and there... Unfortinatly french decor and music cant fix the rest... Crape was tasteless, sandwich was with chips, not with fresh salad (a frenchman will die just after this ) and coffee was just...lets sau it was waiting a long time to come to me  Please do something, the place has a huge potential and can be amazing!"}
{"text":"Authentic French bakery with the best breakfast and lunch options in the quiet village of Lake Las Vegas!  Pastries taste like the ones I've gotten on the Rue D'Clare in Paris!  Outdoor and indoor seating at the lake's edge.  Trés Bon!"}
{"text":"Ok This place was amazing. We went for breakfast and had the bacon gallette and croissant sandwich. Amazing i may go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem at Lake Las Vegas!! Dropped by today for lunch. Perfect spot for rosé on the patio. I loved how the chef makes the crepes in front of us. La Normandie savory crepe paired with some crisp apple cider.. if you close your eyes for a moment you feel like you're in France. Great hospitality and food! C'est parfait!"}
{"text":"In case you really want to go here to try out some of their food.. i would probably recommend to call ahead and see if they have any chicken because they were \"all out\" when i wanted a chicken sandwich..   oh well.. lets get the turkey melt instead...  turkey melt - very good !  price is reasonable...  parking is limited as it caters to the other stores and the water sport activities..  lots of french pastries..   few tables inside.. and alot more outside to include a picnic style bench.. great views of the lake..   might try it again if im back in the area to other things.."}
{"text":"I had their egg and cheese croissant. It was well seasoned and the croissant was fresh and flaky. The view from the outdoor sitting area was appealing. The only downside was they didn't have a high chair for kids available. I assumed all sit down restaurants/cafes would have them."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite place for breakfast or a quick snack.  The Madeline's, Apple turnovers, crepes, and macaroons were delicious!  This Avocado Panini is like a well thought out dance performance.   Soooo perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly service. Staff went over the menu with us and were very accommodating. They also have gluten free options. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place next to the lake great customer service, prices very expensive as a small croissant 2.40$ if you go as leone cafe I live in summerlin and other French places croissant is bigger size this is very small and very price I think they need to lower the prices portion very small as breakfast menu"}
{"text":"Best French food in Vegas! I ate La Poulette for breakfast with a side of avocado. Absolutely to die for! Also, house salad and iced tea are a must for lunch."}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly and humble. The service is great... that's unique for the Village; The pasties are outstanding and the fresh bread to go is excellent. Of course the view is beautiful and the atmosphere is very cozy. Much needed in LLV! Only down fall is the horrific smell of sewage that permeates through the entire lakefront area, but this is no fault of the owners"}
