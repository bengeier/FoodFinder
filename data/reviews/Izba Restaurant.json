{"text":"This is comfort food for me.  I love to get the schnitzel and pierogie platter and a beer.  I love the cabbage and carrots too!  It is hard to finish the whole thing, which is hard to say for alot of places...  The owner is a great person and always friendly.  Quick and good, I would reccommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not sure if decor was authentic, but felt transported to Europe. Food was only OK.

Service was quick, food wasn't as great as I had hoped. Had their cabbage rolls (the best of the bunch), pierogies (a bit too oily/vinegar-y), potato pancake (too doughy for me). Prices were reasonable. Only OK."}
{"text":"Amy is RIGHT. We had the pork special and chicken schnitzel. Awful. 
First of all the pork was covered in sweet brown goop, making the flavor of the luke warm pork taste like something instead of nothing. The potatoes were the only pallitable thing on the plate. Carrots were over boiled in sugar water. Even the cabbage was in sweet baked beans sauce. 
The first schnitzel I received was actually pork and she replace it. The chicken schnitzel wasn't bad but lacked flavor. 
The pi√®ce de resistance was the bill that was wrong. GET YOUR BILL AND CHECK IT TWICE. After paying for the bill inwhich I never saw because the server just entered it into the debt machine, I realized it was wrong.  I went back in and she gave me the $6 she overcharged me with a quick sorry. I should have known she was a scammer when she put my debt receipt on the counter and walked away, letting it blow to the floor.
If you want schnitzel or pork do NOT go to Izsa! You would be better off buying a hungry man dinner!

PS: Where is the skunk, I need to lick it's ass too to get the nasty taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"The BEST schnitzel in the city. I've been coming here regularly since my wedding reception was held in the back room almost seven years ago. The guests at my reception have been back as well, many times!

We go especially for the schnitzel but their other dishes have been equally delicious and the portions are large. The decor is somewhat kitsch but it adds to the old world charm and feels like you're in someone's home rather than in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place tons of times and curiosity and live for schnitzel brought my wife an I in and it did not disappoint!  

First off we ordered the borsch (don't think I'm spelling this right) soup and it was decent, although I am comparing it to my grandmothers. 

Then we took on the perogies and schnitzel with potato salad. Absolutely delicious.  Schnitzel was great and not too greasy. The potato salad was good and the perogies were scrumptious.  

To top this all off they serve big wheel on tap!

Definitely will become a regular. Love it!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. A cd that skipped often was playing and no one got up to fix it. My first glass of water was kinda off-tasting (dirty glass?), but they replaced it quickly without an issue.

The food was just all right, it tasted homecooked, if not bland and/or not seasoned correctly. The meat especially left something to be desired. I really enjoyed the hashbrown-y potatoes and vegetables. Perogies were a hot mess and I needed to borrow sour cream from my friend's plate to make them edible.

It's rare to find a place where you feel everything is homecooked anymore and Izba definitely  feels homey. My friend loved this place, as he never gets homecooked meals. Its problem is they need to take more pride in the food and season it/prepare/present it better."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in a real European home! Authentic! Slightly different from my Greek family...More Polish/German feel...The atmosphere was cute, cozy and personal. I love snitzel and this one was tasty! The perogies were definitely homemade. The owner reminds me of my Papouka. Very cute...."}
{"text":"The worst borszh I ever had. They just put a dump of preserved cabbage into a hot water. Nasty place. Avoid it!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Izba? It's been around for so long its become a staple of the area.

That being said, it's been around for so long that my last two visits leave much to be desired. 

Visit A) When you ask for a pierogi dinner and your date orders a schnitzel and pierogi dinner, you expect them to arrive at the same time. In our case, we received a plate of pierogis we were told to \"share\". Uh, okay. The schnitzel arrived 20 minutes later. By that time, the majority of the pierogis had been eaten by my date. I left hungry.

Visit B) If you order the cabbage roll, beware! Make sure you cut into the centre of the roll to make sure it's hot. Trust me, if you don't, the waitstaff responds by saying \"You took too long to eat. It went cold.\" Again, I left hungry.

I want so hard to love this place, but I've left disappointed far too many times."}
{"text":"This place is SO cute! It's like walking into a little European cottage doll house. I especially liked the classical music playing,  it creates such a nice classy atmosphere. The service was spot on. We came for lunch and we were the only people there. Looked like there was only one gentleman working the front of house and the kitchen but he made us feel like guests in his home, we were well looked after. The food was good too. We had borscht, roast pork special and pierogies. The borscht was great and I would recommend it. Roast pork was also very good. My mum wasn't a fan of the cabbage with tomato sauce but I quite liked it. The pierogies were meh. They weren't home made and if you're used to church pierogies like I am these are just not up to snuff. The prices were a little high but it's still a good value when you factor in the service and the space."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the fam at Izba and I'm impressed.  The decor had this Euro look to it - neither trashy nor refined but homey and relaxed?  Anyhow, the vibe was good and there was a few songs played on the piano by one of the staff.  Staff service was excellent and friendly.  We were there a bit later so only a few tables were occupied which probably helped with the amount of attention that we got.

The food was great and the portions are pretty good.  I had the schnitzel and perogies combo, which came with a big, thin piece of schnitzel and 4 perogies with either roast potatoes, rice or some other starch.  Went for the roast potatoes and they were fine.

Perogie 4-four pack was standard cheese perogies topped with fried onions and a generous side of sour cream.  That's important since I hate rationing sour cream on my perogies.

The highlight of the meal was the schnitzel, yummy crispy coating, the moist, tender meat, sent me to food-gasm.  Like any guy, I'm easy and pretty much anything that is deep fried and meat will have me all over it like a slobbering dog in heat but this one of the better schnitzels that I've had in a long time.

Overall, the atmosphere, decor, staff along with the food gives this place a 4 star.  Only hitch was that the food was a bit slow to come out but when it did it was worth it."}
{"text":"This a restaurant that has lost it's focus and goals. We have gone to it for many years, maybe 10 or more. Hadn't been in about a year due to life events taking us elsewhere. The specials were advertised as one price outside, and when you got inside, more special, they actually cost more. False advertising. More importantly though, the food quality has deteriorated significantly. Schnitzel is a pounded thin cut of meat, not just a thin cut of meat. Raw garlic out of a jar was spooned atop my schnitzel,,, yuck.The cabbage on the entree was inedible. The pierogies came out of the freezer, probably from Costco or some other big box store. It's listed as a Polish Ukrainian restaurant..... why then do they have souvlaki and feta cheese on the salad?

After initially posting my review about Izba, I was stunned to read other posts gushing r about  this restaurant. It looks as if the owner called all his friends and asked for them to post glowing reviews of his failing restaurant. Therefore, I came back and edited the review for clarity. I'm sure Izba was great 30 years ago when it opened. It was good 10 years ago. Maybe even 2 years ago. But now, it is a shameful representation of European food. None of my Polish, Ukrainian, German, Austrian or Russian friends would accept this as good food or service. 

The pork schnitzel was made from thin sliced roast meat, the exact same meat as used for their pork roast special. same thickness and texture. It was overcooked in both cases and didn't have much pork taste. My schnitzel has a tablespoon of raw garlic, out of a jar I'm sure, just tossed on top of it. As mentioned before, the cabbage was inedible. The cooked carrots acceptable. The salad was definitely not great. Okay, but disjointed with the rest of the food. Feta is Greek, doesn't fair well with the schnitzel which is called Vienna. I think the Austrians would be embarrassed. The cabbage rolls were acceptable, but not great. Perogies, definatelly frozen. My daughter got empties. The borscht soup, salty, and a spoonful of garlic dumped in it too. 

We arrived later in the evening, and service was winding down for the night, but we were definitely well before closing by almost two hours. There was only one other table. Once the food was done, the waitress had been released so the owner took over the closing out of the cheque. We were the only table, but it still took him almost ten minutes to pick up our credit card for payment. I let it go about the overcharging for the special as we had company with us. The special being advertised outside said pork roast meal and then all of its sides $9.95, not a lunch special or any mention of that. The sign inside gave the exact same special, but $10.95. Most of us ordered off the regular menu and not the special. However, that's really low bait and switch. I can afford it, but maybe a young couple can't as easily. It's the wait staff who pays as tips usually get lowered.

Perhaps if the food was just off for the night I wouldn't bother but this restaurant needs a swift kick in the pants. Get rid of the frozen crap. Get a chef who is not just a cook heating up stuff. With all the restaurants out there, you can't lower your food quality and expect to survive.

I hope Izba learns from the review and makes changes instead of pretending that there isn't anything wrong.

They used to have good food,, sadly no more.."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place.

Ordered the Chicken Souvlaki.. or should I say Rubber Souvlaki It only came with 1 skewer. What kind of entree comes with only one skewer? The smallest chicken breast pieces ever. 
And on their website it shows 2 skewers: http://www.izba.ca/?attachment_id=61

First, we got a greek salad. The salad was very bland. Had no fresh taste. After our entrees came. It came with carrots and braised cabbage and potatoes. The potatoes tasted like hashbrowns from Ikea but only 10times worse. The Chicken skewers tasted so bad. I felt like I was eating rubber. 

After a while, I noticed the music in the restaurant was the fm radio. That ruined the ambiance big time. Out of no where a bright light turned on. 

The service was minimal. No one refilled our waters. All they did was drop off the food. Didn't ask how the food was, if we were doing okay, nothing like that. It was obvious they wanted to just go home. 

We were there at 7:30 and the kitchen didn't close until 10pm.
Don't go to this place. Seriously."}
{"text":"I went there last Friday (Feb. 5. 16) and ordered the Schnitzel dinner.  It was gross. The beans were overcooked and greyish. The schnitzel was falling apart and the beet salad was a big pile of sledge. My cutlery was dirty. The waitress was scatter-brained. My friend ordered a coffee and we waited almost 45min for it and it never arrived. Of course my friendly smartly decided to just cancel it! The cook girl in the kitchen trash-talked the guests who had just after dining in, for requesting the tv not to be ON as they prefered a quiter setting. I could have sworn I felt something crawl in my pantleg!!  I will NEVER go back!!!  The below pictures are taken in the summer.  DIne-In is the only option."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting

Chicken skewer
Cabbage roll peroggi platter   4 peroggis

Was pricey and horrible
40 bucks down the drain
Honestly the worst place I have been to in a decade"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst E.Euro I've ever had in the city, I give it 2-stars because I like the kitschy decor and the owner is a nice enough gent, but I was the only person in the restaurant and got no service, and the driest, most tasteless food I can remember, like some leftovers have been sitting on a counter all night, microwaved, and then left to cool and served."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the Port Coquitlam location for lunch. Amazing! The decor is understated without being drab. My wife ordered the ratatouille and I had the salmon tacos. They came with house salad as well as carrot-cilantro coleslaw. The salad was fresh, the slaw was excellent and and the two flour tacos just hit the spot. When we asked our server for hot water, she actually brought us a nice teapot of hot water with lemon wedges. That was nice considering that some places visibly don't like it when you don't order alcohol. Final bill? 25.20 and we left satisfied. Note: This is a bistro so don't expect a lot of heavy meals and the selection places more emphasis on the breakfast lunch variety with a Polish/Ukranian twist. This bistro is located at the North end of the Coast Meridian overpass, next to PoCo Inn and Suites. If ever in the mood for a light meal in the Tri-Cities area, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Swiss style restaurant.  Our server was also the cook.  We came in at 11:30 Saturday morning because they advertise a 4.99 all day breakfast on the sign outside.  Once we sat down the server told us she doesn't like to cook eggs and that they are no longer serving breakfast.  I ordered the roast pork special instead.  The sauce that the pork and potatoes were served in was very good, but I got very little pork for the price.  Should of had the perogies maybe."}
{"text":"For a while, my boyfriend and I had discussed how we wished there was a place near our home that we could get some good Polish food. After searching around online one evening, we discovered that Izba (a restaurant we'd seen many times, and even discussed going to try) was actually Polish/ Hungarian... we were sold. 

From the outside it looks like a wooden chalet - really not hard to miss right on the Queensway. The inside is very much the same. Nothing fancy, but a welcoming and relaxing environment. We went on a Sunday night after 6pm and the place really started to get busy between 6:30 and 7. 

I ordered the cabbage roll and pierogie platter and both were absolutely delicious. Exactly what I was looking for (pregnancy cravings). My boyfriend ordered the schnitzel, and it was huge but the breading was light and the whole thing was delicious. For the price paid the food was good. Definitely comfort food. 

I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a good pierogie any night of the week. Yum!"}
{"text":"My high hopes were dashed by the frozen perogies. There is really no excuse to serve store-bought, frozen perogies in a Ukrainian restaurant. Had they made their own, it would have elevated the schnitzel and perogie platter to something worth raving about. As it were, the schnitzel was okay, maybe a bit bland. Could have used more seasoning. The braised cabbage was the best part."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Izba for over 30 years.  We used to eat here at least monthly while we lived in Toronto. We moved to Tampa many years ago but whenever we are in Toronto,  Izba is one of our top priorities.  The food is great especially the schnitzel! You have to try that. The ambience and decor is quite European.  And Chef Marco, the owner, is a wonderful host.  We just arrived in Toronto today and Izba was one of our first stops!  As usual it was great!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. 
I love polish, and I love a good independent restaurant. 
I'm giving it a three stars because unfortunately I wasn't blown away. 
My Vienna schnitzel was thin and oily without much flavor, the potatoes were actually very undercooked and I couldn't pierce them with a fork. *The cabbage was lovely. 
The waitress had no idea what was going on- she offered us drinks and then when asked what they had in the way of juice and soft drinks she had to leave (for ten minutes) to check. Ordering took about 30 minutes in total, and when asked why is was taking so long they pointed to the three occupied tables and said they were in the middle of a rush- even though two of those tables were served and waited on before us, after arriving after us.
It was a little frustrating.
I want to try it again, in hopes that they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Drove by many times and finally decided to drop in. Place is very dated but in a cute  kinda way. Ordering was fast and good. Ordered a Cabbage Roll and Pierogi Platter + a beer. No bread offered, which was a surprise compared to Momma Martino's. Pierogi's arrived on a small side plate (4 in total). Asked if this was a special treat and reply was no, part of the platter. Ok. 5 minutes late a plate with  single, medium sized cabbage roll arrived with numerous hash brown like potatoes, 5 or 6 silver dollar sized wilted sliced carrots, and some over cooked beets. It looked terrible. I was starving and ate the pierogi's. Which were okay. The cabbage roll tasted awful. No rice, and quite hallow with filling. More cabbage than anything. Potatoes, carrots were inedible. Beets turned out to be a surprise. I would never recommend this resto unless they threw out the microwaves..."}
{"text":"Borscht:    1/10 (It used to be so good!)

If you like schnitzel, it's good.  But get it to go, and get it \"a la carte\".

On the plus side, there was nobody else in the place at 6:00 pm (prime dinner time), so we had our choice of tables."}
{"text":"I live close by and was looking for a good place for breakfast. It's average on a good day, at best. I had scrambled eggs, toast and back bacon and was not impressed. I do better making it myself at home."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food I've ever had at a restaurant. Don't be fooled by all the cars in the parking lot, when we went the place was empty. It's difficult to describe how truly terrible the food was so I will use my boyfriend's words: \"My goulash tasted like it had puke in it and how do you mess up perogies?\"

Honestly everything was just so weird...

I should add that I never write reviews on yelp but the 3 stars it has on here are totally misleading. It was all I could do to not warn the diners who showed up while we were there to run far away."}
{"text":"Polish/Hungarian food has a character all on it's own.
I find it more home-style and quite filling even to hungry hungry Hippos.
No wonder I took my Lunch Special Friend here, yes for Lunch.

This house complex has plenty of European character built-in.
Almost to a point that the City can make it a Historical Landmark.
I slide quietly so the sound of Footsteps won't destroy anything historic.

Schnitzel($8.99)

Schnitzel was crisp even to the point where the outer breading had this great crunch on it's own I just kept picking pieces off after finishing the tender Meat inside.  The Garlicky paste on top is a nice touch.  Garlic!

Pierogies($8.99)

Didn't look like much of a serving size, but looks can deceive sometimes.  
Nice genuine East Euro flavours, chewy shell wrap.
Served with sauteed Onions brings a sweet touch.
Served with a touch of Paprika and side of Sour Cream.

Very \"classic\" preparation and home-style plating.
It's a good change of taste from time to time.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal tonight at Izba. It was a quiet Monday night but we enjoyed the old school European charm. The owner was so friendly and food was prepared quickly. Great value and taste. We were even all given soup on the house.!! Please don't pass this place by. Next time I want to have the crepes for dessert if I'm not too full."}
{"text":"Well -- the grouchy Eastern European lady (owner I presume) is when I knew it was going to be legit.  She bosses around some kitchen guy (her hubby I presume).  

The schnitzel lunch special hangs off the plate.   And you'll eat every last piece.  

Reasonably priced too!

I've never had dinner there but hope it's busier than lunch hour.   Parking nearby either beside the building or in the residential neighbourhood beside.  

Try this place.  First class!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been here, I was quite disappointed. Order the schnitzel and goulash as a starter. Loads and loads of garlic in both dishes, the veg on the plate looked like it came from one of those frozen mixed veg combos (not the good kind).

I've never had a tin of beans mixed with cabbage as a side for the schnitzel.

Needless to say I don't think I'll ever be going back"}
{"text":"I recently took a friend to show them what REAL schnitzel was, and WOW.  I have rarely gone back to a place after a long absence and been surprised with better food than i had remembered.

The only thing i order here is the Vienna Schnitzel (and maybe the dessert crepe once).  It was a gigantic cut that covered the plate.  Tender and crispy. What surprised me were the sides hidden underneath.  Last time i was here, they seemed like an afterthought (sparse soggy potatoes etc).  This time, however, there was a large helping of crispy potatoes (NOT fries), cabbage, and carrots.  Both my friend and I cleaned out plates.  The was absolutely NO room for dessert (and we are big eaters).

For the longest time i thought this restaurant was German or Viennese, until a friend told me its actually Polish. Well Polish - Hungarian to be exact. There is other stuff on the menu like chicken, fish, perogies, etc.  But i come for the Vienna Schnitzel. 

Vienna Schnitzel is 10.99, with a 8.99 special from M-TH. The only downside of this restaurant i can think of is that a regular can of Coke costs 1.95.  The greatness of the Schnitzel overcomes this minor drawback, maybe you should just order a beer instead."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went there last night (after a discussion that included Thai, Sushi and Chinese options). It is so kitsch inside and feels like a European cottage. Service was great but it was pretty empty. My friends ordered the full plate options including schnitzel, perogies, and potatoes. Not a place to come if you are watching your carbs! Big plates too!
I had a cabbage roll and a potato pancake. Best cabbage roll ever as it had some flavour and a little spice rather than a mix of cabbage and rice that you usually find. The best part of the meal was my potato pancake, it tasted like spiced potatoes in a donut...
Not overly expensive, the ala carte menu is a good way of tasting a few items before you know what you like. Nice selection of Polish and domestic beers as well. Definitely will be back with a bigger group!"}
{"text":"My pal and I came here the other day. This place has always looked intriguing but at the same time relatively intimidating (if you've never been inside before). Something that looks like a European Chalet in the middle of the city, come on you would be intrigued too!

Once inside, the European theme continued and my friend and I spent a few minutes admiring the decor. Menu is relatively extensive and as per the server (who guessed by the touristy look in our eyes that we'd never been before) advised that they are known throughout Ontario for their Wiener Schnitzel.

However, neither of us felt in the mood for that so we continued to explore the menu. I got a pierogi entree which was delicious, no question these are the real deal! Boiled, stuffed with potato and cheese and seasoned to perfection. Amazing!

My friend had Pork n pierogies and had absolutely no complaints. She enjoyed every bite!

Price point was very reasonable and you can't say they don't have an authentic atmosphere.

Really, this is a place to experience! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A gem in a rapidly franchising world of mass-produced ethnic restaurants, Izba, which apparently means the \"room\", is a cozy corner in Etobicoke where you can step into a little bit of Old Poland, and at Old Poland prices. 

Tasty schnitzel, good vegetables, excellent pirogues and a fine selection of brewskis, get yourself to Izba before it gets swallowed up by something bigger or the owner retires."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. Like Amy N.'s review said, Yelp's system of hiding reviews has eliminated the truth about this place. The server was basically someone that takes your order. The atmosphere is lame. The food is total rubbish. I'm sure this review will be hidden also but I had to at least try to warn people about how bad this restaurant is. I had stopped going to Izba a few years ago after a few bad meals but we were craving schnitzel, in a rush and close by, so we headed to Izba - what a mistake! It was bad before... now it is totally inedible. 

The pierogies are bland and have a terrible texture, far worse than any mass produced frozen grocery store pierogie. The braised cabbage was also extremely bland and had an awful gloopy texture. The \"oven\" roasted potatoes were boiled potatoes that were tossed in the deep fryer for a couple minutes. The carrots and beans were clearly frozen earlier in the day then left to swelter under a lamp. The schnitzel was almost edible, definitely too thin and much smaller than all other schnitzels in the area, but what killed it was that one edge of it had a funk that forced me to spit it out. The meat funk combined with the garnish of raw garlic they use on the schnitzel is lingering hours later. As I sit here writing this I'm trying to figure out how to get the taste out of my mouth. I tried drinking grapefruit juice but it didn't work. I'm going to try sucking on lemons. If lemon doesn't work then like Amy N. suggested I'll have to track down a skunk and lick its ass. Avoid this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"I've been there once with my family and the food was great! We're Polish/Ukrainian so it was great to go out to eat a taste of home without having to cook. I recommend the schnitzel and perogies!"}
{"text":"This place has great potential. The restaurant itself is very European which is nice. The wait staff were very friendly and I enjoyed my meal which was the schnitzel and pirogies. My wife had the goulash and pierogies but did not like the goulash because it was sour and not tender. The thing I really disliked was the dance/club music that was playing as it totally did not match the atmosphere of the restaurant.
I will give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I always celebrate the arrival of autumn with feasting on cabbage rolls.  It's a comfort food that I crave as the leaves turn colours and the weather starts to get cool.

We haven't been back to Izba in a few years but we decided to return for dinner.  The first thing that I noticed is that they have done some renovations to the dining room.  It was once very dark with Christmas lights strung up year round and knick knacks strewn every where.  Now, it's well lit and only one small cabinet of knick knacks remains.  It looks cleaner, tidier and less like a scene from European Hoarders.

We're seated at a table that hadn't been cleared yet as there were still glasses and crumbs from the previous diners.  The waitress took our order - schnitzel and pierogi combo ($13.95), beef goulash and cabbage roll ($11.95) and a pint of Big Wheel Amber ($4.99).  When she brought our drinks, I asked her to wipe down the table.

Our meals came surprisingly fast, and the sheer size of the portions was eye widening.  The food was hot and good.  We were both quite stuffed at the end.  

This is the kind of meal where you need to go home, put sweatpants on and sit in front of the TV for hours just to digest."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials at Izba Restaurant!!

Schnitzel or Pierogies for $8.99!! Awesome!

While watching CP24 waiting for our food to arrive, I can hear the pounding of meat from the kitchen... bang bang bang! Now I know my schnitzel was prepared when ordered!

Schnitzel was deliciously good!! The battering is really light, crispy...and surprising not oily at all!! The pork is really tender........yummy! Pierogies are the non frozen type: chewy and soft at the same time....

While my Yelp Friend having his CP24 fix, I could not help to walk around and explore Izba. A great collections of European keepsakes all around in the display cabinet or the wall, lovely back patio and the sun room at the back.

The deco of Izba really reminds me of the little chalet I visited in Austria.... daydreaming.......the mountain, the sheep, the fresh air...."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible horrible.

I guess when I walked in at 1230 and I was the ONLY one there, I should have left.

Ordered the cabbage role and a side of sauteed mushrooms.

The sauce on the cabbage roles tasted like they opened a can of tomato paste and dropped it on. The cabbage was so tough I couldn't cut it. and the filling???  I've had beef and rice filled cabbage rolls many times in the past, but I'm not sure I can tell you what was in this one. A grey mushy mass is how I describe it.

As for the mushrooms they came in a bed of grease/butter. They were soggy gross and totally greasy.

Need I say more YECCCH!!!!"}
{"text":"Wowza!  I came here on a whim when I was in South Etobicoke.  One caveat: I'm not an expert on Eastern European cuisine, but what I did have here I enjoyed.  The decor is very chalet chic, and you definitely get a family-owned feel to it - I think the wait staff were the children of the owners.  The food - huge portions, and pretty yummy and homecooked tasting.  I ordered a borscht, and it was strangely thick, but not in a bad way.  Very tasty (when I've had borscht in another Polish restaurant and a Russian restaurant, it was a bit more broth-y).  The schnitzel was fantastic, perfectly crisp and the portion was GYNORMOUS.  The other sides: steamed vegetables and parbroiled rice - were not great, but they were of course not the main reason we came here.  Prices were also very decent - about $13 for a HUGE main, my schnitzel was about one and a half times the size of my face and I had to bring it home for takeout.  

I'm curious to return to check out the perogies."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the seemingly distant location of Izba - it's west, yes, but you can easily get there on the 501 Queen streetcar or the 80 Queensway bus from Keele Station. 

Now that transportation's not an issue, let's talk about the food. 

Izba is an authentic, appropriately-styled and quaint Polish/Hungarian (and sometimes even Austrian, too) restaurant that's been around forever. You can get pretty much any typical Eastern Euro fare at Izba - schnitzel, goulash, borscht, pierogies and more. The service is very warm and welcoming and will make you feel like you've been transported to Europe for the duration of the meal."}
{"text":"Dear yelp....wtf?! All the 1/5 review are hidden and the 4/5 are shown...bias much?!

My partner really wanted schnitzel so we went.

Atmosphere: very old decor yet pounding hip hop music. Only few people on a weekend night so speaks volume.

Service: waitress was friendly and prompt that is why the rating isnt a one.

Food: how is this place opened?!

only good dish was the mushroom. 
the other dishes...food tasted like the presentation. worse than tv trays and canada rouge airport food. the pork roast is in a suspicious brown liquid. after tasting it...i need to lick a skunks ass to get the taste out of my mouth. their schnitzel...is it schnitzel? dried and just awful. 

very cheap to eat here but i rather they charge more and actually deliver quality food.

would not recommend!"}
