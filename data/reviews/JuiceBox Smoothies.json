{"text":"They added some shots, for $2 only. Ginger lemon shots very good if you have stuffy nose and feel like you are getting sick :), but the taste is the worst among the three shots they offer!!!!!! The other shots very yummy with lots of healthy protein :)"}
{"text":"Many time my friends, many times. We always had platters of wraps and salads delivered for my sisters pre-wedding celebrations, workshops and youth events. the food has always been a hit. The chicken wrap especially when its spicy is awesome. One wrap fills you up.  The delivery comes fresh and warm all the time. Pleasent service straight from the heart.  Will not hesitate to recommend."}
{"text":"There are new menu items added! Healthy rice bowls, over night oats and fresh juices anyone?  I like that's it's accessible outside of the gym so you don't have to feel weird about not having a LA Fitness Membership!  The new color on the walls give it a fresh look!   They're also available on UBEReats"}
{"text":"This awesome juice bar is just inside the entrance of LA Fitness at Courtney Park but you don't have to be a member to visit! They have lots of different wraps (all day breakfast wraps too!), salads, healthy snacks (protein bars) and smoothies. Bonus: substitutions are welcome! I had the peach, mango and strawberry yogurt smoothie, which was delicious! The owner and staff are super friendly here. I will definitely be back to try more of their food and smoothies!"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced. Staff seems very knowledgeable with all the drinks available. Nice central location! Their coffee shake had a good kick in it. The staff was very nice and was very patient in explaining how all the drinks. The pastries were delicious as well. Outside the gym was the best location which was very convenient."}
{"text":"This is a great little smoothie shop inside of LA Fitness. The owner is great about making suggestions based on what you like. The in house made protein bars are amazing!! All of them. Seriously, the only thing that got me through my wedding day without passing out."}
