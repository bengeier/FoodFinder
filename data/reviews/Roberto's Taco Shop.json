{"text":"First of all when you go thru the drive-thru they dont greet you at all. There food is also very greasy. And when your done ordering they never tell the total. How are we supposed to know how much the total is if they dont tell us."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Roberto's on Flamingo and Rainbow!! We had a caterer scheduled for lunch today at work for Employee Appreciation Week who did a no call/no show, and I called Roberto's to see if they can make 90 tacos within a half hour.  They made three types of tacos within our requested time frame, packed them nicely and helped us load them in the car.  They were delicious! Thank you for saving the day!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows this is the Best place for something cheap and Amazing! If its just for a nice Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Hangover Meal its perfect! I love this place not only there food, but easy service, and quick serving!! My suggestion is to go inside rather the drive thru it will be quicker trust me!"}
{"text":"The potatoes in my breakfast burrito were not cooked all the way, way too much seasoning on the carne asada fries, and to top it off the cashier was extremely rude and unpleasant. I'll stick to the other taco shops, thank you very much."}
{"text":"We had the Shrimp Burrito & the Carne Asada Chimichanga special. The special came with rice, re-fried beans and a drink.  The food was really good, the chimichanga & the burrito were both large. The rice and re-fried beans are very average so don't get your hopes up.  The decor is a combo of cafeteria and take out style, kinda like a \"Baja Fresh\" remix, but not many people go there for the ambiance.   However I will repeat , the main entrees were good. A great value when compared to taco bell or dell taco, we had more than we could eat with drinks and spent less than $17.        :-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times.  It's the typical food that you would get from any other equal establishment. Two stars for the food.   Saw a rodent running between storage and kitchen in the hallway (possibly rat) when waiting for food.  Horchata was watered down and tasted old or something."}
{"text":"Best shrimp cocktails in  north las Vegas! They are prepared fresh and spicy.and there opened 24hrs so anytime I have a craving I can stop by and grab one."}
{"text":"The best mexican food in Vegas! I'm so glad one opened near where I live, because I'm obsessed with their MENUDO!!! It's a bowl of awesomeness topped with WINNING. I used to think Pho was the perfect cure for a hangover, but Menudo tops that now. Too bad it's only available on the weekends.  The Carne Asada Burrito and fries are my typical order. The burrito is a good size and is just delicious. The fries are probably one of the best carne asada fries I've tried on the west coast. You get a giant portion with LOADS and LOADS of toppings!"}
{"text":"Go to robertos all the time and like this location so decided to give a good review. Its located inside the litle mini mart. Whenever I go the employees are always very nice and patient with me seeing as how I useually order about $30 worth of food off memory(dang my forgetfullness i.e. list) My order has never been once wrong which is very important due to hypersensitive eater towards onions in my family. So definately stop in if your craving some good tacos and the churros are worth a try :)"}
{"text":"OMG while visiting for 3 days we ate here twice.  Delicious tacos and a clean restaurant with friendly & helpful staff. A surprise find while visiting from CA   Meat & guacamole was overflowing from our tacos. . Five star tacos."}
{"text":"Upgrade your stuff this place gave me cold chicken from the beginning I felt as if the atmosphere was off and after receiving the gruel in which I did I knew I should have followed my gut feeling. Please Roberto hear my words and refine this location."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here one night to get our grub on. It was their idea, not mine, since my very delicate constitution needs to be taken into consideration. I ordered the #2 combination plate (burrito, Mexican rice, beans and a bev), since it has rice, and how bad can one foul up rice? We waited a while, and drank our drank. Finally, our order was ready and we got our tray (apparently, more than one tray is not allowed?) Remember my mentioning of my delicate constitution? Well, I was eating my burrito, and for some reason, I had major intestinal distress. Imagine being a passenger on an airplane and the captain calling in an in flight emergency, it was THAT BAD. I don't know what it is with me and Mexican food, but I needed to vacate my bowels desperately. Luckily, no one was using the (unisex, ugh GROSS!) bathroom, so I quickly excused myself and made it in time. Now, I was only there for a few minutes, but let me tell you, I believe I saw whole galaxies born and die within that short time frame. The horns that tore down the walls of Jericho could not have reached my ears, with the amount of blood pounding within. I thought I was developing Parkinson's by the amount of uncontrollable shaking. And then it stopped. I finished my bathroom routine, washed my hands (because I'm a gentleman), readjusted myself in the mirror and rejoined my friends. They asked if I was doing well, since they mentioned that I \"looked as haggard as a $5 trick in NYC during Fleet Week.\" I lied, because the staff was looking over at our table, and said that whilst swallowing, something went the wrong way. I did ask if they would mind trying out some of my burrito, so everybody took a bite and deemed it was fine. So, I figured it must be psychosomatic or something, and continued to eat. Remember I mentioned fouling up rice? Let me tell you about the rice. Bland little kernels of heated material. Being edible is one thing, but actually trying to put it down is another. Luckily, the grease from the burrito was abundant, so that after a futile amount of gnawing, it could slide down. Notice how I didn't mention anything about the beans? Between the rice and beans, the rice was manna from Heaven. Discuss. I decided to continue on with my rapidly congealing burrito. Now mind you, my friends and I are there, chillaxing, talking and eating. So, a bite of the burrito and a swig of the mop water (Pepsi, if you need to know), and conversation. Bite and swig. Bite and swig. Hello! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I made it on time once more, and this time I thought I was passing a Toyota. Not a Yaris, but a fully tricked out Avalon XLE Touring Sport Edition. I sweat to God, if I had gripped that metal stabilization bar in the bathroom any harder, I would have left handprints. I feel sorry for tearing this place down, since I know that the staff is following recipes that they can't deviate from. The staff aren't at fault at all. It's just that something within the recipes themselves makes their food as welcome farting in a crowded elevator. What is it with me and ethnic food?  TL,DR: Between 1) eating Mexican (in this case, Roberto's) or 2) kissing the meth heads north of the Strip full on the lips, 5 full seconds of contact, a litle bit of tongue? Bring on the Blistex."}
{"text":"Well after eating so many times at this place I decided to finally write a review.  The good: I usually go to this Robertos for a late night snack, trough the drive thru  and order the Carne Asada Fries,  more bang for your buck, with taxes it comes out to $8.63. Now i'm a picky eater so I only get the fries, Carne Asada, and the cheese.  It  always taste great and the people working the drive trough are always courteous.   The bad: The only thing i periodically dislike is that I don't think they have a set standard of how much stuff they put on your plate/container. Usually I'll get lucky and get great amounts of Carne Asada, Cheese and Fries. A couple of times though the guy making them (it's always a guy) gives me good amounts of beef but will skimp out on the fries and the Cheese. I llike my cheese! lol.   The ugly: I think the owner is hella (west coast slang there) cheap. Since we started visiting this Robertos, the drive true speaker has been broken. You usually can't understand the person taking the order, and many times the person taking the order has told us to drive directly to the window were you pay to take our order. I think I've visited 15 times this year, and it still hasn't been fixed.  Also I dislike the whole \" pay one extra dollar to use a debit/credit card\" their website says they have 65 locations total, I think they can go without that extra \"one dollar fee/surcharge\"   I would have given the \"taco shop\" a five if it wasn't for the chepness and the irregularity of the carne asada to cheese to fries ratio. The taste of the food and the service does give them a solid 4 in my book. I still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Robertos... But lately the food they make tastes like booboo. It's never hot and the next day I get sick from it... This place doesn't get my order right on the regular so we will not be coming back. Get it together !"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru this morning and sat there for 5 minutes with no answer. I finally decided to drive around to make sure they were open even though they are suppose to be open 24 hours. I pulled up to the window to find the workers standing around the kitchen socializing instead of paying attention to their job. One of them finally came to the window and acted like I was inconveniencing them and asked me what I wanted. I ordered a shrimp burrito with some substitutions from what was on the menu. When I got home and took a bite of the burrito I got a shrimp in my first bite only to find that the shell and tail were still on the shrimp. I opened the burrito to see if it was the only one like that and maybe it was just overlooked but they were all like that. I called the restaurant and spoke with Francisco, I asked him do they normally leave the shell and tail on the shrimp in the shrimp burritos and he said \"uh I don't know that's how the cook made it.\" And after a few seconds when he realized I didn't like that answer he said \"yes we do\". I said that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard because in doing that I have to open the burrito and remove the shells and tails and then reassemble the burrito which never seems to be as good as the first time. I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager wasn't in and after I asked him the manager's name and he told me it was Victor he hung up like we were done with the conversation. I'll be returning later today to get the burrito remade the way it should have been made in the first place but won't be going back ever again. The food was ok with the exception of the shells and tails but the service was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"what a shit, me and other two family members, got California borito, two of us vomited the food last night, I just can't vomit I dont have that reflex and I am at home day after with stomach pains, and my body hurts and I have shivers. Do NOT Eat there"}
{"text":"Well here I am against me saying that I would not be going outside in this cold!!! But when two of my kids said that they were hungry and want to go to Roberto's Taco Shop \"my 8 year old daughter call it the place with the good beans and cheese burritos\" I could not say no to them or my pansa I love the chile Colorado burrito but I always have the girls their put some cheese on it. And now that we walked here I guess I'm going to be frizzing all the way back home, but it is always less cold back home because we are leaving here with our stomach's warm from the good hot food. It's always worth the cold walk to get the hot food if you can come up here try their carne Asada Fry's they are worth the. Walk day or night"}
{"text":"Hung up on me rudely when I said hello,  then they refused to answer any of my follow up calls. Apparently they don't need the business or want to treat their customers with any sort of interest."}
{"text":"I am giving them 1 star and it is for the lack of quality in the salsas. Both green and red are always watery. I would like for them to learn how to make salsa since it is the dressing on the food that is suppose to give a dish flavor.  As a Mexican, it's embarrassing. Roberto's taco shops are increasing prices as of November 1st, they should increase quality of product while they're at it as well."}
{"text":"Burn this god forsaken Robertos to the ground, I will never eat here again because as I am writing this review I'm in the bathroom right now dying. These guys gave me a virus and now I can't even move. Disgusting to even think how I got the virus but definitely positive it is from the food. It was the last thing I ate and the only thing I ate in the past 14 hours, have not been able to leave the bathroom for about 3 now."}
{"text":"I love the chicken taco night. Last night we ordered 50 tacos and they were great. I also love the tamales and taquitos. My only problem is that they need to have iced tea, fresh iced tea, not that fountain tea. Other than that everything is fine."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. I wont visit this Roberto's ever again, lucky there is another location near by and I go to that one and give them a good rating."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place!! I always order Carne Asada fries with extra meat!!  ($3+ more)  Whenever I am hungry after work, Robertos Tacos is always the first one in my list."}
{"text":"I have been going to Robertos since it started at this location. I was excellent until the last couple of months. They have screwed up my last three orders. I looked at my receipt when I get home, but they can't fill it according to what I ordered. I also order chicken tamales and they were so old I had to throw them out. Now tonight I ordered cheese enchiladas and got chicken. Then I ordered chicken taco they are alway great this was uneatable.  Someone better look at management of this store very hard, because this is unacceptable  to our community.  We love this store, but Taco Bell is right next door. It isn't equal but at least it is eatable."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!! The food was cold and wet in the inside and slimy.. And I ask to get it warmed up and the guy looked at me like a pissed off Mexican and said.. It's the sour cream and guacamole.. I said.. Umm everything is cold.. And he warmed it up and it was just warm and nasty.. Not seasoned and cold the cheese dint melt.. I mean chunks of solid cheese.. Like WTF !!! and THE DAM LOCATION IS HIDDEN !!!!!! Inside another location like wtf AND THE RESTRAINT LOOKS LIKE A DOG POUND !!! Wow !! Just horrible nightmare"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Mexican food late at night. The food is always fresh and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Woke up craving a not on the strip breakfast and found this fast food taco shop down the road from my hotel. Pretty basic but the chorizo and eggs (#9) hit the spot. Clean and friendly counter help"}
{"text":"Love this place! And love taco Wednesday! If u want awesome fresh authentic food this is ur go to place for sure!"}
{"text":"Ah, carne asada tacos... food of the Gods! Even Jennifer Lopez thinks so as she references TACOS in her song \"Tacos y Burritos.\" The lyrics go something like THIS: \"Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco. Don't think just because I got a lot of money, I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey. Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.Taco taco. Burrito burrito.\"   And taco flavored kisses you shall have in combination with an intense bout of watery diarrhea after you eat at Roberto's. No need to go camping for an episode of Giardia induced diarrhea... or are you a fan of vibrio cholera? Mmmm...rice water stool... kinda looks like the horchata in Roberto's most likely cockroach infested drink mixer.   You know there's a medical school just down the block from here. I'm sure the med students would love to practice on you if you can't make it to the closest urgent care center! This place tastes okay if you're into lard flavored lard with a side of atherosclerosis. Definitely NOT weight watchers friendly. On second thought, maybe the colon cleanse might help me fit into the plus sized black dress that I recently got from Adele's Thrift Shop."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. Not like. The one on rancho and lakemead. That. Store is so hit and miss. But anyways best mexican food on this side of town. There burritos are nevet skimpy always nice and filling. You wont leave hungry that for sure.. enjoy"}
{"text":"Normally. Im a robertos enthusiast. But today. Was the day the music died.. the lady working the window was a c.u.next Tuesday. And who the hell puts bell peppers. In a quesadilla. And there carne asada taste like water.. sorry robertos. You score low today :( and that makes me sad.. $25 wasted"}
{"text":"I got the Carne Asada Fries and the fries are the most perfect things ever and just everything was perfect. also, awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Been here before service/food is usually  great. Just walked in, there's about 5 customers waiting, no cashier. Finally after 5 minutes cashier comes walking from back still on the phone and says \" what do u want?\" Wow, really??!!! Then he was talking and almost forgot to give me my $14 change!! When he did and me my change the wasn't even looking at me and instead was turned around joking with the cook while talking in the phone!! Come on man!! Someone needs to do some better hiring!!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the NW at the recommendation of a friend. Maybe the only Roberto's in town that has Carne Asada Onion Rings. Someone needs to tell the owners they should have that at ALL locations so I dont have to drive so far next time. Came around 3 in the afternoon on Monday and the placed was packed with kids so I ended up taking order to go. Other than that, same great late night eats as other locations!"}
{"text":"Though in general, I absolutely adore the food here at Roberto's, I was absolutely disgusted be their restrooms. Not only was there a roll of paper towels in place of a roll of toilet paper, there was a droplet of bloody on the floor, and a blood stained paper towel atop the trash can. For one, people should be courteous enough to throw their blood stained toiletries in the toilet or at the very least the trash can, but for two, the staff should be on top of the one restroom enough that their guests don't have to encounter the potentially dangerous (health wise) effects of a blood laden bathroom."}
{"text":"I go here about twice a week because of the convenience of how close it is to my house. With that being said. The food is good. It is as traditional as I can find here so far from living here a week. I like the enchiladas and tamales. The tacos are bomb too"}
{"text":"Smallest and most expensive burrito I've had compared to the rest of the locations. The tortilla was super hard and the place was pretty dirty. They also charge you an extra $1.25 if you use your debit card... This place is not worth it, I would recommend a different location."}
{"text":"The worst Roberto's I've been to in Vegas. I have always called in my order to pick up. Even with me calling in I have to wait 20 minutes. Most of the time, they get my order messed up or they give my order to somewhere else. It's always super hot inside and smells weird. The employees generally are rude and looks like they hate their jobs. And the kicker is they don't have Mountain Dew, which every Roberto's seems to have except this one. Overall poor experience after poor experience at this location."}
{"text":"I've  been to many robertos locations and this is by far the worst of them all. I ordered a carne asada burrito which I didn't  get til 25 minutes later and that's being the only person there. It took them 20 minutes to cook up a batch of meat of at least 20 pounds. Why didn't they cook up the small amount to get me going verses cook up the whole cow and make me wait during my lunch hour.   Secondly, I was served a burrito with flavorless meat. They didn't  even bother sprinking any salt in the meat let alone seasoning. Overall the worst burrito ever!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! There's plenty of good taco joints in Vegas that have good food and nice service, don't waste your money at this robertos. It's a shame cuz the food at this location is not bad but I'd much rather give my money to a place where I'm not treated with attitude by the cashiers.   The cashiers especially those in the drive thru need a major lesson in friendliness."}
{"text":"Definitely best staff nd service one this side of town ! California burritos are amazing"}
{"text":"I would give this place less than a star if possible. The cashier with facial piercings was unnecessarily rude making a remark at me not being able to choose a drink size \"there's only two sizes\". I felt unwelcome and would not recommend this Roberto's especially if you're not a local."}
{"text":"Ok the food is really not much to talk about, its good and cheesy but kinda bland for mexican food.  The only reason I am leaving a review is cause the guy that works the counter at night is so AWESOME I had to put it in writing.  I don't know his name but I usually see him around dinnertime and he is always so happy and friendly and upbeat.  He really cares and that is such a rarity these days.  Thank you for being you and making me happy every time I come in."}
{"text":"I like the menu and quality of the food. Service is friendly and fast. Each location is different and this one is just fine."}
{"text":"I guess after trying a couple of items on their menu I can only say that most of their plates taste the same as most of their Mexican restaurants and besides the fact that they are open 24/7 you may have 1 or 2 items that I actually like although I wouldn't go there as my first option it's ok for a craving that will make you go eat at 2 or 3am in the morning but I would actually call ahead like 15min before going since they do take a while to prepare any plate.."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service - I felt like my appearance bothered them . Twilight zone weird"}
{"text":"I went to this Roberto's today very disappointed I started ordering one of the things I wanted to get for a family of four after I said the first thing the guy told me okay I got your order pull up I wasn't even done after finishing my order I went up to the window and I paid with my credit card and it took him a while to even give it back he just took it and close the window after a while waiting we got the food but no receipt!...I had to ask him to give me my receipt!  it should be automatic that they give you a receipt not that you have to ask for one ridiculous if you want better service go somewhere else! never going here again!!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Carne asada taco taco was dry and boring. Same with \"rolled tacos.\" Chile relleno burrito was its saving grace. No free water and the proprietor was rude."}
{"text":"i don't really crave mexican food, but sweet chihuahua their tacos are frickin good! i thought $2 a taco was a bit high, but they were stuffed, and worth it.   why not 5 stars? every Robertos i've ever gone into, smells like floor cleaner.......wth? you know, that bleachy smell. so i drive thru. or get to go. ole"}
{"text":"Terrible service,I walk up to the counter and the cashier is taking a personal call on the phone as I walk up she nods at me however keeps up her conversation she then sets the phone down runs to the back counter to check her text messages then runs back to the phone and continues her conversation meanwhile I'm just standing there waiting to place my order. It was very awkward and uncomfortable because both the cashier and cook were laughing. I do not understand Spanish so of course it made me feel very uncomfortable. I waited for my food and when it was ready she set it on the counter and yelled it's ready and immediately turned around and walked back over to her cell phone! Worst customer service everrr. I probably will be sticking with another location from now on."}
{"text":"I ordered the carna asada fries, tastes horrible, & ended up throwing it all away.  No discounts  for the military.   Your better off going to viva el taco, free drink with your order."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse portion are small and is very expensive .  I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"So I live close to this place and have heard the raves about it, but I'm not the biggest taco person. I was working with a television show whose taco truck fell through last minute. Since everyone was really looking forward to tacos I suggested this place. I called them up and they said no problem and were nice and accommodating to me and said we should do the make your own taco platters. When we got there to pick them up they were ready right on time and gave us so much. They were super nice (even though I know we were being at least a little bit of a pain) and the food was amazing. Everyone loved it and the fact they could put together the perfect taco. I'm definitely coming back here on my own with my bf regularly now. I was also really impressed with the inside because from outside it looks like a tiny hole in the wall, but it's really nice and very clean looking. You guys really got my vote as one of the best places I've been to in Vegas keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"In the universe of taco shops, I'm a fan. Good Mexican food at low prices. Try the adobado plate--really good seasoned, sauteed pork tips. Carrot and jalapeno salad worth trying--better than most. Somewhat shady neighborhood, especially after dark--best for lunch. Much better than typical fast food and even most sit-down Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Really this is spot is so overrated and that's the truth. No this isn't an isolated incident or anything it coming from someone that knows authentic Mexican food. The carne asada comes in chunks and isn't cooked thru all the time."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.  See my tip also posted below.  Chicken chimi, enchilada style - 4 1/2 stars...full of chicken, crispy, tasty.  Oh, and be warned, it is BIG!  I had to ask for the shredded lettuce though.  Beans - the refried beans were pretty good.  A bit salty though.  Rice - see beans comment.  I really liked the chimi.  Best I've had since I lived in Tucson.  I'll be back to try other items."}
{"text":"I would probably give this more of a 3.5, but since there are no halves, I'll round up.  If you want some inexpensive mexican grub, this is definitely a place to come to.  My good friend told me that this is one of her fav mexican places back when she was in san diego and i can see why...their carne asada fries were quite tasty...my only gripe is that there weren't enough fries! the amount of carne asada totally overpowered the fries.  most people will prob think i'm crazy in wanting more fries over more carne asada but when the carne asada is considered a topping for fries, i better get a generous portion of fries.  In addition to the carne asada fries, i shared a fish burrito with my sister and that was yummy! no over flowing juice action that always happens whenever i eat burritos, where you feel sauce dripping down your hands and arms like waterfalls.  it had the right amt of liquid sauce as well as veggies and generous portions of fried fish.  As for my friend's fiance's chicken burrito, that was all chicken...so much so to the point that he said he couldn't think about eating chicken for a whole week! haha....so definitely come here to try the carne asada fries and definitely come here if you LOVE meat., otherwise, the amt of meat they give you may be a bit overwhelming."}
{"text":"Went to the location on Craig and Nellis. It was really early - 4 or 5 am.  I was sick for 2 days afterwards. Can't recommend it. Also, they don't appear to use any salt during food prep because the food has no flavor. It has taken me weeks to write this review but I still want my money back!  If you are going to visit a Roberto's, the shop at Boulder and Russell is always clean - guessing no one gets sick from poor food prep/employee hygiene there."}
{"text":"The best Roberto's Taco Shop..!!"}
{"text":"I live in Oregon and when I came down once a month I go here almost everyday. I love the tacos. If you like old fashion tacos that are fried these are the best. They are very generous with the meat. Excellent, thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"Sooo good.  I love cheap burritos (as vegan as they can possibly get). I've eaten a lot of them. This one particular burrito I had was sooo good. I will remember it forever. I got some Sierra Nevada from a neighboring liqour store, kicked up my feet at a 29usd a night hotel, and watched Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.   It was a beautiful experience. [I like Roberto's even better than Farolito on 24th in SF, I thnk. Shhh! Don't tell.]"}
{"text":"Wow... What more can I say. Anybody that has been to any of the Roberto's locations around town knows that they will be served a fast, fantastically tasting meal in the tradition of real Mexican fast food with a price that can't be beat..."}
{"text":"Robertos is always a great choice! Great mexican food, cooked in front of you and open 24 hours! I reccomend the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Last time I came here I got a free show of three homeles people fighting in front. Also there were a few cockroaches. But the place is always open.. So there's that."}
{"text":"I have noticed that the breakfast burritos and chicken tacos are half the size they used to be.  Portions used to be generous and I found myself there 2 to 3 times a week.  Two chicken tacos used to be enough to fill me up, it now takes 4.  I used to be able to split a breakfast burrito with my wife, now we both want our own!  The food and service are good but I am disapointed that they are cutting back on portions.  I will be looking for another place for my Mexican fast food fix!"}
{"text":"DO NOT go to this Roberto's location.  I've been to other Roberto's in Vegas/Henderson as well as the San Diego locations without any problem... but I know at least 2 people who have gotten food poisoning from this one! Stay away."}
{"text":"The problem I have with Roberto's is there very inconsistent one time I'll get a great meal and then the next time I get burned eggs on my burrito"}
{"text":"WORST Robertos location in the valley. I go to the University location. I was extremely excited when this location opened just down the road from me. I made the mistake today on going to this one and I knew better. My wet bean and cheese burrito was all tortilla and no filling. I've had many problems with this location from beans not being completely cooked to burritos being so thin they'd fit through a mail slot. This location is hit or miss with MISS being the primary theme. Continuous disappointment... I'll continue going to the University location and this one can continue raking the tourists over the coals who know no better."}
{"text":"So good, makes me feel good so I don't feel like I have to go back to California to get my Mexican food fix. Got the two taco combo. Green sauce was awesome, fresh made. Jalapeno are super hot like I prefer. Ingredients fresh. Got my shells fried. Wash down with 1800."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the slowest roberto taco shop in las vegas. I have come to find that roberto franchise is very hit and miss. As some locations are efficient and are generous with portion size ...others, like this location, are incredibly slow. Expecially the three girls that work together and the food is still cold. Porque?"}
{"text":"One of the best locations in vegas , always fast, hot , people here actually care , and this location makes me enjoy eating robertos often !"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Nothing had any flavor, the carne asada meat might as well have been boiled, it was chewy and gross, the tortillas are huge and tough, and NOTHING had any flavor. Tossed 75% of it on the trash 30 seconds ago and my stomach is already upset from the few bites I did eat. If this is the best Mexican food in Henderson, don't go to Henderson for Mexican food. This was atrocious. Never going back."}
{"text":"Food is great, they're quick making orders and it's cheap; especially for the servings you get. I usually get the Carne Asada fries which to my liking comes with an abundance of meat. Their service is great, I've been going there for a while now and they have never gotten my order wrong (knock on wood lol). Definite 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me preface this review by saying I love Roberto's. I mean shit, you're hearing from a guy who once ate it 18 days in a row when I first moved here from Phoenix. Dead serious, check 4 square I think I'm still the mayor?   However, this specific location is amateur hour. ESPECIALLY, the Friday late night crew. I've often made my order crystal fuckin' clear only to get home and open up a complete disaster. Not only is the order a muff job but the shit is either burnt or raw. Maybe it's because multiple people take my order or maybe it's because the lead cashier was busy buying weed from a customer in back.   Whatever the issue is I hope it gets fixed because while I'll never eat at this location again, I hope to have the confidence I once had in the Roberto's name restored so that I may be allowed to quench my carne asada fries thirst without the fuckery of non professionals.   P.S. I ALWAYS tip these mother fuckers. Can you believe that shit? WTF is my problem?"}
{"text":"Am I ordering wrong? Been here a few times just to make sure, but all visits left me craving real Mexican food even more. Roberto's didn't do it for me :-( Tried several items on different occasions and all were pretty boring - nothing special.  Tried: Chicken enchiladas,  chicken tacquitos, chicken quesadilla, crunchy chicken and beef tacos, rice & beans etc.  I've never had their burritos,  so maybe that is the ticket??"}
{"text":"I like robertos and this location is small but service was quick. My food was good at a good price. I didn't like that they charge per debit transaction fee. That was my only downfall."}
{"text":"Ordered two fish tacos and they were so disgusting they gave me to tiny pieces of what looked like fish sticks they where so hard no flavor do not order the fish taco ."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! They don't not wash their hands or wear gloves when making food. I am disgusted ! They cook everything with bare hands and does not wash hands before making food"}
{"text":"It gets 1 star only cuz it's 24hr n 1 of the few things in the area that is. I don't understand everyone's rave reviews of any of them, the food is no where close to good. It's greasy, sometimes slimey, n not close to real Mexican. The only thing Ive found to be edible is the nachos. It also doesn't help that on the few occasions we have ordered from here they messed things up or even not given us food (like the meat when my husband ordered the carne asada tacos). I'd rather go to the taco bell down the street when I want quick Mexican"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed. Good non - fatty meat fresh and flavorful. Fast and friendly service too..not the best in the world but it's better than most. Clean place too..probably will be back."}
{"text":"I like to eat the fried Carne Asada tacos. Ive been eating that for a few years now since my college days and its always consistently good. Also have had the Carne Asada Fries and they are pretty decent and the Chimichanga has been recommended to me by my friend for years. Been to a few different locations thru-out the city but this one is the cleanest one. Not an everyday kind of place but good enough to keep on the list for that once in a while visit. Solid B."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago where the make the best burritos in the country.  I've looked everywhere for a decent \"fast\" Mexican restaurant and Roberto's is it.  I only go to the one on Fort Apache & Charleston, but I'm sure they're all equally as good.  I've even left the burrito section and ventured into the combo plates, which are just as good!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a Mexican fast food place that is sort of between a fast food place and a restaurant. They don't make bad food with my personal favorites being the carne asada fries, the carne asada chimichanga combination plate, the shrimp a'la diabla and their rolled taco. This place is down the street from my house so I do eat here a lot."}
{"text":"Starving. Super late lunch. Out of desperation I walked across the street to see what this place was about.   Empty. Totally empty. The girl at the counter: blank. Total deer in headlights. No hello. No acknowledgement. Just a blank stare.   Having never eaten here before and not being familiar with the menu, I strained my neck looking at the ceiling trying to decipher the menu. Then to wall on the right.   I ordered my 3 rolled tacos with sour cream. She asked beef or chicken & I asked which was better...yeah, I got nothing. I really wanted her opinion & she just stared right through me. Completely non friendly, empty, emotionless.   When I returned to my office I opened the box & saw nothing but cheese & sour cream. Okay, in we go. Bit into the first roll & here's what's odd; the ends completely hot & crispy, the innards cold.   I was so hungry I didn't care.   Until after I was done eating and I did. My stomach would not digest this mess. 4 hours later & it's still sitting there.   Never again will I sacrifice hunger for nastiness, or $3.73."}
{"text":"The only thing I like about it is that it is 24 hrs., however, I haven't gone back after my first attempt at a breakfast burrito.  if you're fine with the same, bland burritos, keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place has really good food for a good price, I go there to get lunch a couple times a week. I love their hard shell tacos with beef, the are delicious, way better than any other tacos I tasted. They have these marinated carrots that you can get for free, those are the bomb! I also love their green sauce. What I did not like was their shrimp burrito, it was just plain, but the breakfast one is good. Anyways, great place, great food, try it if you haven't already :)"}
{"text":"Kudos to the food but customer service sucks. We ordered through the phone and the lady that was getting our order was BEYOND rude, I wasn't even done ordering and she told me to remind her about my drinks cuz she's busy and hung up. My friends and I go there to pick up our food and there wasn't any barely people! To top it off super bad attitude when I asked a question. I'd rather go to Don Tortaco right next door, food is great and customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"The staff was kind a portions were large. Have amazing salsa and hot sauce. Really fresh ingredients with amazing punch. Food was cooked to perfection and prepared quickly. In and out in 30 min with three orders"}
{"text":"If you feel like eating tacos or tortas this is your best place for the money. You'll get full with 2 tacos. And they are actually pretty good. And meat always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the burrito de lengua and it was delicious! Every time I'm in town I make sure I stop in.  Food is always great, can't beat the price and is available 24 hours a day! Love it!"}
{"text":"I like Roberto's, been to several other location, this one isn't as nice.  Question first: Isn't it standard to get sour cream with burrito?  Maybe I've been spoiled by Taco Bell lol.    Charged $0.95 for sour cream.  Which is fine even though I thought sour cream was standard. When I got the carne asada burrito, there was no sour cream in it!  I took it to the counter, and she says, (i'm paraphrasing because she didn't speak english very well) see that green?  You see how it's not all green?  How it has a milky white to the green?  Well that's the sour cream mixed in.  Okay, so for $0.95 I get a hint of sour cream.    I asked for a cup of water, she turns on the sink water and throws it in a cup, because apparently the soda machine doesn't have a \"water\" option on it.   The carne asada meat was saltier than normal."}
{"text":"To describe it simple the was good and the taco de asada BOMB would make the drive from Vegas again"}
{"text":"All I can say is chicken tacos with lime yyyyuuuummm, they are very quick at this location, nice and clean"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in this place!!! Tasteless , disgusting food?? If you could call it that! My boyfriend and i got sick! I seriously threw up at the site of his food..no lie, i gagged and got sick! My shredded \"beef\" was Dry ,had no flavor, was a weird red color .it was strange the beef was dry & leathery beef but bun was soggy ?? My boyfriends carnitas plate was actually carne asada they got his order wrong... A.d the beans were runny and loojed like diverting that belongs in a toilet!!!! Horrible experience! Worst Mexican food ever!!! I wouldn't even give it one star"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and save your money you'll thank me for this anytime I've ever eat Roberto's I wake up the next day feeling like I ate a bowling ball the food is always tremendously greasy they do a decent late night crowd but its all the drunks trying to ward off a hangover I recommend you go to Fausto's instead much better food"}
{"text":"Always good here. Always fresh. No extra charge for cheese on the Shrimp burrito cuz it comes with it. The breakfast burritos are awesome. The lengua is great. I have had no complaints at this location. Their red hot sauce is on point with flavor all the time. We've been to MANY Roberto's in Las Vegas and they all fail compared to this place. Very friendly people who are rude if you don't speak Spanish."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Like other Roberto's the cheese doesn't come with the Shrimp burrito. I find that odd because that's the way its supposed to be made. The location on Nellis and Stewart stays true to the original menu and they don't argue.  The second time at this place was just 5 days ago. Ordered 2 sausage breakfast burritos. The burritos were not good. They were filled with deep fried potatoes ( dry) and deep fried sausage ( dry), a little cheese, and next to zero eggs. They were wrapped crappy and then wrapped in paper so sloppy that they fell out in the bag. All the ingredients are supposed to be cooked on the grill with the egg to sausage and potato mixture is supposed to be 2-1. The whole thing was dry and hard to choke down.  Honestly, in the whole Vegas valley, only the Roberto's at Nellis & Stewart gets every item cooked correctly and tastes amazing. Other locales are going to have to step it up. Very disappointing I have to drive 20 mins for good Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"This isn't my usual Roberto's location, but they nailed it tonight.  The refried beans were smooth, the cheese enchilada had perfectly melted cheese, and the guacamole had delicious chunks of raw onion in it.    I might have to check this location out again to see if they can keep it up!"}
{"text":"Quick friendly service and always serving it up fresh. There is no drive thru at this location so be preppared for lunch rushes and the 2AM-ers blowing up the churro stand! Always a favorite: rolled taquitos, tamales, chicken tacos and stuffed churros. Locale is clean and is outside adjacent to Fabulous Freddy's."}
{"text":"Had chicken tacos for lunch.  It's fast and inexpensive."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Ordered Carne asada fries and when I opened them they smelled rancid. The sour cream was bad so I took it up to the lady that took my order and told her I wanted to order something else or for them to remake it and she wouldn't do either or so I told her I want my money back and she said there is no refunds. ARE YOU F****** KIDDING ME?!?! never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Good food can only be enjoyed when they actually give you what you order. 2 of the 3 times I have been there they have forgotten a significant portion of my order. Just now I waited 20 minutes in line to pick up my called-in order, only to get luke-warm food that had been sitting on top of the fridge and was missing one of two entrees.  They've lost 2 customers today."}
{"text":"Woman at the counter was rude, and I watched the man who originally started taking my order handle my food without washing his hands or using gloves...I'll be going to the Roberto's just West of this one from now on where they're clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Service is always good, and food quality is consistent. This location is also very clean!"}
{"text":"No matter what time of day. No matter what time at night. Robertos never lets you down...this location especially!! There is a very nice lady that works there, and she is always going out of her way to make my experience the best every time. I've taken numerous friends and family to this Robertos, and they've all loved it. The patio outside is always clean and pleasant to eat on. Whenever I decide to get rich, there will definitely be that nice lady running the Roberts I put in my house!"}
{"text":"Went to Roberto'a on Pecos avenue food is great for the price and the restaurant was awesome clean ,my son recommended it.So glad!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the other Roberto taco shops. It's decent, but they sometimes get your order wrong and they don't seem to add as much toppings to their nachos as the other Roberto's do. Still maybe worth a visit."}
{"text":"I enjoy the beef nachos here the best. I've only ordered through the drive-threw at this location once. All Roberto's are open 24 hours 7 days a week."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Roberto's out there! The workers are very nice as others have said on here and they usually smile while taking your orders. Plus The place looks very clean and you can eat outside!"}
{"text":"Roberto's breakfast burrito is bloody amazing. I usually get the potato bacon breakfast burrito. I ask for green sauce and limes. This burrito is ginormous and delicious. I also ask them to put  pico de gallo in mine."}
{"text":"The local spot! CLEAN, friendly and quick food. My  favorite is the #4 on the menu, they also have very good carne asada nachos, not so good chicken nachos. The chicken is shredded (boiled) and flavorless, maybe if they dice and grill it. The food is fresh and affordable! Now if they could serve margaritas, it would be my weekly stop."}
{"text":"Grabbed some food for me and my crew after a hard day's work. I should have known better than to eat my lukewarm burrito! A few hours later I was sick as a dog. Puked and almost crapped myself to death over 3 days with the food poisoning (sorry to be graphic).  Swore myself off fast food forever after that fight for my life. DON'T EAT HERE EVER! Just looking at their pictures is enough to make me wretch. Reported them to the health department. Minus infinity stars. Puto!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, I've been here a few times in hope my problems with the food would be resolved but every time it's the same greasy food. One time I ordered a chicken burrito, simple right? When I bit into it, grease spilt out everywhere. It was like someone turned on a faucet of grease, I've never seen anything like it. Usually when I go now I just get tacks, still drips grease though, not pleasing"}
{"text":"Food was alright. Came here after a long day at the pool. Customer service sucked. Whoever works the cashier was beyond rude and had a nasty look on her face when we walked in. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This location is the best one we have found.  I agree with the post about the gas station locations.  The worst Roberto's we found was at a gas station, but  this location has a nice decor and has always been very clean.  The staff has been all hispanic, who better to make more authentic Mexican dishes?  A plus there.  And they have always been very nice and efficient  The food is a great value.  Big portions for a small price.  While we have liked a lot of things and go often, there have been some dishes that were not the best.  The nachos were a big dissapointment, very very greasy.  So they lose a star for a few bad dishes.  But their flour tortillas are the BEST!  They are HUGE!  I could make a meal out of those and refried beans only.  Clean, good food and unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"This is usually our go-to for quick and yummy Mexican food. But my take-out order today was not good, which was all discovered when I got home. I ordered 3 chicken and 2 beef tacos, non were labeled, they were dripping with grease and meat filling was so minimal we thought they were missing the meat. I also ordered 2 BRC burritos, they missed putting rice even though I paid extra for it, and grease was literally dripping out of them too. Didn't have these problems in the past. Didn't have time to drive back to bring these issues to their attention. For the sake of providing good quality food and staying in business, management will need to make improvements."}
{"text":"Gross. Chicken tastes like toilet water. Bad service too. Want my 14$ back. Yuck Yuck Yuck Yuck Yuck"}
{"text":"Get a Burrito.  It has meat and guac and salsa.  I ask to add Beans and Rice to it.  Looked at me like I was crazy and then demanded it was $1 more.  Really......$1 for a spoon full of rice and beans?  It doesn't get any cheaper than rice and beans folks.....  I ask for no tomatoes but only onions.  They don't have that.  Onions and tomatoes come together as Pico de Gallo.  Yea, I'm aware what Pico de Gallo is thanks.  I just wanted Onions and was told they don't have any.  A Mexican Restaurant without onions?  Rude, slow and then they started talking about me in Spanish.  Just because I'm white, blond and blue eyed, doesn't mean I can't speak Spanish.   Understood every word."}
{"text":"Usually rude.  Asked for Onions and cilantro on my taco, did not want pico de gallo.  Was told they don't have onions unless it's in the pico de gallo.  Makes me miss the REAL taquerias in Cali!!! It's like a prison cafeteria....attitudes and NOT customer service friendly AT ALL!  Asked for carne asada burrito with rice and beans.  Get told they don't put rice and beans in their burritos.  I asked can I pay extra for you to do so?  No..... Really?  This place sucks."}
{"text":"Their rolled tacos are bomb. We call them taquitos...the last few times I've eaten there I've gotten sick the runs in hour or less. The cashier and cook were rude and loud. I asked the cashier for my drink first, the cashier said sure then made me wait till my order was up?! I will not be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"i think this place is open 24 hours or maybe just open till really really late.  but this is the place to go when your in vegas and your craving some carne asada fries after the clubs. haha!  it fills me up..it a full dixie paper plate full,  good for sharing."}
{"text":"Best taco shop on southern highlands! Better if you call in your order so you won't have to wait!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a lifelong, diehard Roberto's fan who frequented the first shop in Chula Vista, CA for decades. I moved to the East coast and look forward to driving straight from the airport to Roberto's before doing anything else on the way to my mom's. Well, it's over. I arrived Sun eve and went to Roberto's for my favorites and was hugely disappointed. The food had been losing its flavor for a while but this time it was actually bad. They don't make their own machaca (shredded beef dish) but now use canned beef - the kind that's bought at big box stores. It wasn't even chopped well or mixed with the vegetables. The beans in the mixed burrito were tasteless. The rolled tacos seemed stale and hard vs crispy and they put a lot less sour cream than they used to. My mom told me she'd take me to another place Taco y Taco and it was fabulous. I'm done with insisting on R's."}
{"text":"This was a very average place.  Not good,  not bad just average.  It was clean,  it has a salsa bar, the cashier was pleasant,  parking was easy,  bathrooms were clean.  The food was fine,  hot and as shown on the menu.  The Styrofoam plates are less than desired but whatever.  I have no plans to go back but wouldn't refuse to eat there either."}
{"text":"I like coming here for a big, cheap mexican meal. Order the breakfast burrito. Comes with ham or bacon. Ingredients: scrambled eggs, hash browns, tortilla. Its pretty sizable, at least a pound of food. The salsa bar has a choice between the green and the red sauce.  At 6 am, theres maybe one or two other patrons so I get to enjoy my meal in silence. The service was friendly too."}
{"text":"I've always ordered to-go whenever I've been here, and the service is super fast. I love their tacos. Great value for the substance."}
{"text":"Very fast service from the second I walked in the door. Tasty and food was fresh. Polite workers."}
{"text":"These guys are legit!!!! Nobody touches Roberto's!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here...24/7 makes it easy, too! Prepared fresh, quick, and consistent! Clean, friendly, great for dine in or take out! I'll often bring friends from out of town, and they always love it! 5 stars every time!"}
{"text":"horrible horrible horrible the staff was so disrespectful and rude, one day they will say something with so much disrespect to the wrong person and then oh no!"}
{"text":"Never felt so disgusted in my life! My husband and I did a quick stop at Roberto's by Nellis AFB and order two Carne asada fries and as I was grabbing red sauce I seen something crawling out of the salad bar. It was a cockroach! I've never been so disgusted in my life. The two people that were working there didn't make it any better. Soon as I spoke to the guy about the roach he had no idea what to do so he called the manager and I'm assuming he didn't answer and decided he continue cooking. I brought it to their attention the second time letting them know the roach was still walking around the salad bar.  I made sure to take pictures and video. I will definitely call the health inspectors."}
{"text":"a great place for late night snacks... love the carnasda burrito... like mexican food... is soo good.. it hits the spot..!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this location 3 stars because I love Roberto's.  I have been to this location several times now and it's just been awful customer service every single time.  It's not hard to have a smile on your face while you take someone's order.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I live in Massachusetts, but come to Vegas almost yearly for a minimum of one week at a time.  I've eaten at many of the pricey restaurants both on and off of the strip throughout the city because I always get a rental car to make sure I can get around to where I want to go.  I was in the mood for some Mexican food so decided to yelp it to see what was around.   Roberto's had the best reviews and it's no wonder why.  This was the best meal I've ever eaten in Vegas and definitely the best Mexican food I have ever eaten anywhere, with decent sit down restaurants costing 3 times as much for the same items included!!  I got a carne asada burrito and my wife got a chicken quesadilla and both items were unbelievably tasty!!  My wife is not a huge fan of Mexican food and she also normally judges a place by the appearance.  If it weren't for the reviews she never would've agreed to get out of the car and eat here but she's glad she did.  She told me she would go back to Roberto's in a heart beat.  If you are visiting Vegas, or live here but have never been to Roberto's, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Best shitty experience ever. I never get my burrito the way I want, the cashier always drop my change on the counter missing my hand, usually the food comes out cold, and I get yelled at for pointing something out that was wrong. I gotta say, Robertos is off the hook.! I'll still be coming here because the cashiers and cooks have very little patience when you don't tip them or say thanks you tho. Best place evaaa"}
{"text":"Unless you speak Spanish do not bother all the people who work at this company are rude.  I went to the Roberto's on Losee and had a really rude server when I complained I received a phone call from a person at this location who asked me to bring in my receipt and she would replace my order as they have had problems with this girl before.  I went and was told nobody new anything about this and basically I was looking for free food.  I will never go there again and I suggest you don't bother"}
{"text":"You probably can't really go wrong at any location of Roberto's...Personally I LOVE their quesadillas.  They are open 24 hours, and they are conveniently located everywhere.  I have had several things on the menu, and I have never been disappointed.  Best of all, it's CHEAP!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, and always an excellent meal.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Vegas 6months ago I've seen a Roberto's in like every shopping center, so for lunch today I said let me give it a try, must be good if it's all over the place. Boy was I wrong!!! It was ok at best, I had the chicken Tacos and I had some cartilage in it, not okay with me, the cheese they use is super cheap, all in all no quality, only reason I give it 2 stars is they had good sauces and it's open 24hrs, if I'm not drunk and starving at 3am in would probably never come back here again"}
{"text":"When I first came to Vegas, I was almost thrown in the stockade and burned at the steak for asking, \"Whaa?\" when someone mentioned Roberto's (affectionately Americanized into Robert's by my friends and I).  \"HERETIC!\" they cried.  Luckily, I pulled out my sugary sweet tea smile and explained in the thickest Southern accent I could muster that I was just a girl from lil' ol' North Care-liiina, and I was forgiven.  NOW I know that Robert's is the ultimate hangover food.  One friend always gets the rolled taco meal with guac, the guy likes the carne asada super nachos with sour cream, beans, and cheese only.  Another friend with an empty leg clears a california burrito with all the fixin's, super carne asada nachos, AND a quesadilla.  I love the chili rellenos and tortillas.    And who needs to worry about drunk driving to this place at 4 am when I can easily stumble a block down the street to get here!  And if you don't live a block away from THIS location, I'm sure you're a block away from SOME location--they are about as prolific as rabbits in springtime.  So, go get yourself a pollo asado burrito with sour cream and cheese, and wash it down with a tall glass of horchata.  You'll thank me in the morning.  **That's the general plaza address...I tried looking it up but it's not on Google or anything and I didn't feel like walking down there JUST for Yelp...but maybe I will later today**"}
{"text":"I only come here because it's the closest mexican stop from my house and the food is so-so good. It satisfies my carne asada cravings. :-) but the cashier girl must hate her job -- or life. She never smiles and if she does, its a smirk or some giggles, sometimes some eye rolling, even though I was just telling her my order.... I was waiting for her to tell me my total (which created an awk moment) until I asked her, so she pointed at screen instead of just telling me.... LOL customer service sucks here. I hope she gets some more training how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Whever I feel the need to gorge myself with the most stomach-twirling food, I head down to good ol' Roberto's! Not just any Roberto's, it has to be the one on Eastern only. Only here do they really know how to make a great steak enchilada or burrito at four in the morning. Apparently this isn't a secret though, because everytime I arrive, fully hungry (and fully loaded) there is always a wait...but hey, it's a small price to pay for perfection."}
{"text":"I come here often and love the shrimp cocktail but tonight was pathetic. I had 3 little shrimp in it. When I called for a manager I was told there was none on duty. Pathetic and will lose customers this way."}
{"text":"Robertos is mosdef my go-to mexican food fix! I come here mainly for the carne asada fries and their horchata! They are open 24hours which is awesome! And this particular one has a drive-thru! double awesome! They also have free condiments such as, salsas, jalepenos, cilantro, diced onions, etc. available for you and its suprisingly made upon order! Well this particular location anyway. The staff is great and friendly which is obviously very important enjoy and happy eating :)"}
{"text":"I'd give a 0 if I could. The staff is very friendly, but the food is HORRIBLE! My husband and I got food poisoning from some lengua tacos and Carne asada fries. I guess I should've seen it coming when the cashier/cook said he was having trouble finding the lengua. (cow tongue. Hey, don't knock it till you try it... Somewhere else, of course.)"}
{"text":"The food is okay. The staff used to be really nice then they hired a ghetto cashier with gauges in her ears. Unsanitary, if you ask me. I took my food back after they gave me a chicken enchilada plate when I ordered a cheese enchilada plate. I may have let it go if the enchiladas weren't so dry. They barely had a few tablespoons of sauce. After I asked for my order to be corrected, the cashier told the cook that I was a crazy b*tch in Spanish. Umm, excuse me? Did you forget I speak Spanish? Especially since I ordered everything IN SPANISH? geez. Bring the old cashier back. Then I'll give this place a good review."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Roberto's on Lake Mead before.. After a while the customer service started to suck.. Giving you the combination while ordering the Ala Carte.. And one person during the day is always talking about the customers and calling them 'Penche'.. wow.. I always hear this guy talk down on customers thinking they can't understand spanish... I don't look spanish but I do understand... The food is still good, but men that guy taking the order during the day is bad."}
{"text":"This place is ok, not great but alright. When your hungry for some quick Mexican food its good. But what makes me give this place 2 stars is the lady behind the counter that takes the orders. She always has a sour face like she hates her job!!!"}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good Mexican restaurant especially out here in Vegas..this place has great customer service and great food..I definetly will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I had a horrific experience at this location late last night.  I ordered cheese enchiladas and my cheese was cold and not melted the red sauce was cold, my beans were hard and cold and then on the second order it was completely wrong my guacamole was runny it looked like pea soup.  This was my first time to this location and I will never be back!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Other locations have let me down a bit in the past.   Food was out of this world. My party ordered carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, chicken torta.....I had a chile relleno  burrito. Slice of heaven!!  If you are looking for the service of 5 star dining at a taco joint I don't know what planet you are from....as per other reviews.   Clean, quick cordial service, huge menu,  large portions, excellent food....what more can you ask for?!  Did I mention open 24 hours?"}
{"text":"Roberto's is crap...when you order take out via telephone they never get it right..for instance I ordered 1 beef enchilada & 1 chicken enchilada for my wife..pretty simple right? Well when I go pick up my order i take it home just to find out they gave me 2 CHEESE enchiladas NO MEAT...I was pissed...called them up told them that they didn't give me the right order....no I'm sorry let us make it right NOTHING.. they kept insisting that I got the right order....whatever...i wasn't about to go all the way back there...another time I decided to give Roberto's the benefit of the doubt and ordered from this particular location i just chalked it up as that where I ordered before that was bad...NOPE ordered the exact same damn thing 1 beef enchilada and 1 chicken enchilada...i went to pick it up and sure enough 2 CHEESE enchiladas AGAIN!!! I was so pissed off that I just said forget it you people are idiots..NEVER went to Roberto's again..."}
{"text":"Went inside to order 12 chicken tacos on taco night. Big mistake. 3 people before me and 3 people after me got their orders and the entire drive thru line was cleared up. When I asked about my order, they still managed to get it wrong. Their only saving grace is they are lucky I'm so cheap. I guess you get way you pay for."}
{"text":"Usually great but every time I come to this location I have problems. Today I order a chili colorado to go when I get home and open it there is 6 chunks of meat. I often order this and ar evey other location I never have a problem. When I brought it back all she could do was say sorry. We pay hard earned money and these people here don't care rip off!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Robertos but this Robertos located across UNLV is terrible. The food tastes old! My friends got a chicken quesadilla and the tortilla was super hard and flaky while the chicken was dry and the cheese was gross. My other friend got a torta and the bread was old!!! ."}
{"text":"This was the worst level of attention to detail and customer service I have ever seen.  I order a small amount of food, only to have half my order incorrect.  When I returned to get what i ordered, I was informed by the cashier that she took the order correctly and that I was wrong.  No refund or corrections.  After a bit of back and forth, the manager stepped in and changed the food out.  Of course, the cashier decided to chime in and call the paying customer \"Stupid\"... in Spanish of course.  Yeah, this didn't go well.  And in the end, I still didn't get what i ordered.  They still got it wrong.  Chicken does not sound like pork... or steak.  And after we argued, the cashier had the nerve to charge for the difference.  And then walked to the kitchen.    Why?  Why would the CASHIER (your not a cook) go into the kitchen.  That's where my food is being made.  I can only guess why the angry cashier would be in the kitchen where my food is being made.  NOPE NOPE NOPE.  fix yourselves."}
{"text":"Food is Fantastic, Large Portions, NEVER do you leave hungry... Best Mexican food in Las Vegas... Would give 10 star if I could... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL....!"}
{"text":"Got the order wrong, visibly upset in the kitchen that they had to fix it. Didn't  matter because after eating found food greasy and under seasoned and messy presentation...Family dissapointed and said Del Taco is better..."}
{"text":"Best little taco shop, by the house!! fast ,good and cheap!!! and the hot sauce ripz!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Tried to charge me again for what I already paid for. Greeting in Spanish who does that at a restaurant???!! You fucken live in America should I remind you that the main language is ENGLISH!!! I've had better customer service at different Roberto's, these men employees swear at every other word they say, very uncomfortable. They are the typical 'macho' men from Mexico who just are stubborn and think every women is wrong and none of them have patience. DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION. HIPE THEY CLOSE!!!"}
{"text":"Being from SoCal, I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob.  Taco shops are on every corner and most are really good.  I have been craving good mxn food in Vegas but still looking.  This Robertos had a good tortilla and the hot sauce was alright, but the carne wasn't what I hoped.  More like boiled steak that was sitting around with little flavor or seasoning. Service was decent and overall just OK.  May try again and get something else"}
{"text":"Again. ...food poisoning. ....it was 2 1/2 yrs since I ate there last... I got sick then and I'm getting sick now Saturday and Sunday in bed"}
{"text":"I eat at robertos 8;30 in the morning...the only thing i eat;;;;  by 11;30 that day i was very ill....tryed to call nobody returned my call...still very sick the next day i called the general manager....he was very rude...blamed me ...said they got no report of anybody else getting sick....the store would not reyurn my call how could you know if anybody was sick if you don\"t return calls....his name is ronldo....finally the manager of the store on vegas and rainbow called me back....."}
{"text":"This is the worst robertos in town, they should close their doors. The service is terrible and the staff is s rude and they don't care about customers at all. I hope the owners read this and fire the entire staff and get real people. This is the last straw they screw up my order every time.  Wish could give no stars"}
{"text":"It is authentic! Go for the carne asada.... I like it in burrito form! And a large horchata...."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  First took forever to take my order then once they took my order it disappeared.   I said i want my money back she's too busy trying to find my food.  I said it a second time she says well what did you order? Really and her attitude was the worst.  I get she didn't understand my English but since where in the US please understand your customers are always right.  I will never eat at that place again.  They need to train ppl basic customer service skills.  Nasty attitude to go along with filthy restaurant.   Should have never stopped."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of Robertos and this has to be the best one so far, everyone is so friendly and the food is hot and fresh tasting, I really recommend this spot"}
{"text":"I went there about 4:10 a.m. to the drive-thru pulled up to the order board and sat there for over 7 min no took my order, no big deal I thought maybe it was broke so I pulled around to the window. I saw the.one counter guy standing by the order window and then he bagged one burrito. I heard the alert go off for the drive thru he walked up to the Mike right by the window took an order I tried.to get his attention he ignored me went back to stand by the order window  started talking to the cook and pointing at me he then slowly walked back to me opened the window I told him I was back at the drive-thru oder board for over 7 min and no one cme on and said be right back we are busy or anything. all he said was you weren't first, as I left there was only 2 people eating 2 burritos. I just moved close to this location but it's the last I'll stop here on grave yard again. I  ended up driving to the rancho and lake mead and they had 4 people in Line about 10 people eating and a car in the drive-thru ahead of me they still took my order fast and got the food fast and it was great as usual, they could teach the graveyard crew at the north Losee location how to run a graveyard  shift."}
{"text":"My favorite Robertos in all of Vegas... Always clean, always fresh and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"So.. We come to this Robertos at least once a week and the food is always good just like all the other Robertos, although I prefer the location on craig this is closer to my house.  Tonight they packed up my 3 rolled tacos w/ sourcream and cheese (which i havent even orderd sour cream on them but they charged it anyway) upside down in a paperbag so when they arrived at home it looked like someone had puked in the box. Also ive gotten a bean and cheese burrito and there was barely anything on there. I couldnt eat the tacos because it looked just to nasty. So for me i will never return to this location i'll drive the extra mile to another location and so should you!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's food and this is the closest one to me. Unfortunately, they give really bad customer service. Whether I speak in Spanish or English it's still a bad experience with costumer service. I refuse to go back even though I really like the food! Sucks that their good food can't match their customer service."}
{"text":"We went to Robertos Tacos on Halloween and we had their Chicken Tacos.  My wife was feeling sick about 3 hours later. It was time to take my 6 year daughter old out to trick or treat and she was all dressed up.  My wife said I need to go to the hospital so we did.  She was at the hospital for 6 hours with severe food poisoning.  I called the number in the store the said for comments or complaints please call this number so I did.  The person whom I'm sure was in charge of all the stores said I needed to call the franchise owner so I did. I got their voicemail. No calls returned!  Eat here at your own risk !!!"}
{"text":"Food is way to greasy for me. But if you like deep fried junk food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I take it recipes for Robertos are not all consistent with each location.  I ordered the same as usual.  The Carne Asada Fries and the Carne Asada Burrito.  And it was just not like I had before.  I have better luck with the location further down on Craig near Decatur."}
{"text":"I havent been to a Roberto's Taco Shop in at least 5 years and I decided to try it again. I can't remember why I skipped this one out of my Mexican food places but now I think I remember why. It's not that great but if you like a quick Mexican fix, this'll do.  The place is simple, service is fast, and it's fairly clean and decent place to have a quick lunch. I observe a lot of people coming for to goes but the time I was here, none stayed. Maybe its me? Hehehe. Oh well."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  Good and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.  First go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \"meh.\"  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.  Second go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.  A special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.  An all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent."}
{"text":"Beware! This location charged me extra as a TIP without my knowledge. The price I was owed is different than the price I was charged and they also did not include my drink with my combo like they should. This is a late night scam! Beware"}
{"text":"Charge $1.50 for extra onions? A whole onion does not even cost that! Food always comes out wrong! Only good thing is it is open when ever!"}
{"text":"Bfast all day! The staff always cooks the food fresh and never have a problem!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in vegas well maybe anywhere I have ever been!! I love the salsa bar green salsa as well as the spicy carrotts and peppers, fresh cut cucumbers... I love this place and its right down the street from me I could walk there :)"}
{"text":"This robertos taco shop isn't making the food right they're just acting like fools and they make the food taste horrible!!!! I'll be contacting the cooperate office until they get there crap in order"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. I will never, ever eat there again. They should be closed down til they find out what went wrong. They don't serve real meet."}
{"text":"The worst robertos I've ever went to! The staff was sooooo rude I walked past an employee that was mopping and I said \"excuse me\" and she sighed very annoyingly and placed her hand on her hip. And then another employee told me \"that those foam cups are for water only!\" Very rudely! Because she saw it a different color and told her I squirt MIO in it and she should watch her tone! Very rude!!!!! Will neeeever return there!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was surprised how good this place is everyone should try the fries so bomb so different."}
{"text":"my story is true. i  used to cry when i had a chicken burrito....so spicy and good.  the tears going down my face.  this was in 1997. now i take my wife there. i dont cry anymore.  its not as spicy but still real good. they actually have chicken in the burritos, what a concept!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Roberto's!!!! Breakfast, lunch and dinner! All is amazing! Love their tacos and their carne asada! Delish! Breakfast burritos are cheap, huge and amazing!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and was pleasantly surprised when I saw this place very close by. Came in tonight and was helped by a really nice guy, his customer service was great he even helped another customer pick out a more cost effective meal BRAVO!! I ordered the rolled taco meal and OMG I will be back soon. Not to mention it's 24 hours Winning!!!"}
{"text":"Carne asada fries no beans add rice no onions Is what I always order. Although they got it wrong twice because I always order over the phone. Thus is the best roberto's around. The staff is cool I don't speak Spanish but they always smile when I come in."}
{"text":"I came to this location after giving up on the Sahara/Sloan location.  I must say, the food is MUCH better! They aren't stingy. Your plate is packed with food, it's all flavorful, they have a salsa bar (no flies!) and the interior design is different from all of the other locations that I visited. The staff has been pleasant and hasnt gotten an order wrong yet.  The adobada and carnitas aren't all hacked up and dry, the tortillas are HOT and the rice and beans aren't bad. I actually have enough food to save and eat later and it all heats up well. This is the Roberto's that you want to go to."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. I ordered 4 thinking they would be the small street tacos. I was wrong. They are at least twice that size and packed full. Great food, great value. Will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Guys here are to busy fooling around with his friends and holding up the line but good food"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos. Rice & beans. Side of guacamole. Guava juice.   Best lunch ever."}
{"text":"There dollar chicken tacos are awesome and the all meat asada burrito to been to a few Roberto's the one on nellis x Vegas valley the best"}
{"text":"Good food.  I ordered a Torta.  Way better than other places.  Real Mexican food.   Not like Cafe Rio or such."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews of this fast food Mexican restaurant, I finally stopped by.  I normally like \"Americanized\" Mexican food with ground beef and the availability of french fries.  This is real Mexican food with all the titles in Spanish.  I had the best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had.  A simple item, but with the creamiest beans and melted cheese I will definately be back to sample a larger part of the menu.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the unavailability of ground beef for us gringos."}
{"text":"I saw they opened a new Roberto's in a new strip mall near me on the southwest corner or Boulder Hwy and Russel Rd. Not sure of the exact address.  I have seen Roberto's elsewhere in the valley so I decided to give them a try. I've tried this place twice now and both times the food has been barely edible.  First time I visited I got the beef taco platter. First thing I disliked is they use shredded beef instead of ground beef. The beef was very tough and stringy. It took forever to chew and eventually swallow. It's like they took the cheapest beef cut available and boiled the hell out of it. The juices coming from it were watery and bland. The refried beans were loose and runny. The only decent part of the meal was the Spanish rice which was OK.  Yesterday I decided to give them a second try figuring maybe I just ordered the wrong thing last time. This time I decided to order chicken instead of the beef. I got the taco and enchilada platter.  I cut into the enchilada and forked out a big chunk of chicken which looked OK, so I popped it in my mouth and it was like trying to chew a wad of wet newspaper. I have no idea how they cooked this chicken to get it to this texture and complete lack of taste. I never had tough stringy white meat chicken before. I was literally picking the chicken fibers out of my teeth for a half hour afterward.  I gave it my best shot- 2 times just out of fairness, but I won't be eating here again. This was just bad!  I see other Roberto's get great reviews and I hear they are franchise operations with different owners and menus sometimes, so maybe this restaurant isn't like the others- let's hope."}
{"text":"My in-laws live close by & absolutely love Roberto's. So, while visiting this week we called in a big lunch order (for pick-up). Their tacos are larger than typical [tacos] and are made with fried corn tortillas. They come ala carte but a side of rice & beans is cheap enough that you can have a filling five dollar lunch. Honestly, I felt my food was just okay but my husband loved his pastor tacos. I give four stars instead of five because (A) The customer service over the phone sucked (hung up on me while I was asking for the total), (B) They only use Cheddar cheese (I'm from California...is the cheddar a Nevada Mexican restaurant thing?) and (C) their salsa bar was a mess and had empty containers."}
{"text":"How do you say \"gross\" in Spanish.  The food was simply disgusting.  Won't even eat here again."}
{"text":"The girl on sunday-monday night around 2:30 am thinks she is the owner of that place she refuse to serve me food.she doesnt seem happy to work there...I have an advise for you bitchy mexican girl \"quit that job if you are not happy with it\""}
{"text":"Everything tastes like dirty dish water. Same awful taste 6 times in a row. Went 6 times due to its location and hours. Will not go again."}
{"text":"The food is normally good however today it wasn't.  I tried something new the shredded beef tostada, not good.  The beef had good seasoning but was tough and chewy.  Also the cook the shredded beef with bell peppers and onions which I'm not a fan of.  I was highly disappointed this time."}
{"text":"In Comparison to Bay area Mexican franchises this place isn't too that great. Its meat rolled in a tortilla. I'm not Mexican but I'm sure that Burritos have beans and rice at the very least. Come to my suprise when I order one from here and receive a tortilla filled with MEAT not even all that great tasting lol. I miss home. I guess you can say but hey if your ever in SAN JOSE Go to La Victoria and tell me who has the better franchise. Later Yelpers"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  Tremendous value for delicious food.  Chicken burrito for $3 -- huge, filling and tasty.  Fast, friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Food is great once you get through the attitude of the employees. Countless mistakes on the orders.  And it is FILTHY: the bathrooms, the dining area, the tables and so on."}
{"text":"Food is good and hardy. Excellent Mexican pickles and carne asada burrito.  Perfect choice for quick roadside bite."}
{"text":"Muy caro por una extra de queso, más de un dólar y no les ponen casi queso, en otros lados te cobran la extra de crema o queso o lo que sea por 75 centavos."}
{"text":"I like this place mainly for breakfast but it is good all day and nightt.  It is always clean.  I would like friendlier counter folks but seriously, it is a taco joint, but still, it doesn't hurt to be friendly.  Food is always excellent.  What I like best is the speed I can get in and get my food.  That is what I need in the morning."}
{"text":"Nothing like a late dinner cheese quesadilla with spicy enchilada sauce... Robertos style.  Always friendly  good prices here."}
{"text":"So i bought a carne asada breakfast burrito and found egg shells in it. Really the cook didnt see it or just didnt give a you know what."}
{"text":"I wish i could give 0 stars. The lady was so rude, not responsive, They didn;t have any cup for water and food was so nasty."}
{"text":"Must try the carne asada fries and rolled tacos!!! They're the best!... You may have to run a marathon to get over the guilt, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"This location ALWAYS takes a very long time to prepare your order.  Call in ahead of time or expect to wait at least 20 minutes even when it's not crowded. They over socialize with one another and can't multi task so they stop and chat instead of preparing your order.  They put shredded lettuce on top of all your food, child rellenos, enchiladas, tamales etc so if you don't want it tell them in advance    This is my least favorite location"}
{"text":"If I wanted cheddar cheese on my tacos, I'd go to Jack in the Box.  Bland food for bland people, with a side of guacamayo."}
{"text":"While probably among the cleanest of their locations, 3 times in a row over the course of 3 months our order has been at the least incomplete. Once completely wrong. Attention to detail is severely lacking at this location. Not to mention the lady who walked in over 5 minutes ago and still goes unnoticed at the register while employees are laughing and talking in the back."}
{"text":"There are only two Roberto's in town that deserve a 5 star rating everytime. This is number one. The one by UNLV is the other. For some reason, everything in here is better than what I've tasted at most sit down Mexican restaurants. The rice is perfectly fluffy everytime. Salsa is never too watered down like the other spots. The carnitas are almost a joke they are so good. I've been coming to this location specifically for 10 years. I moved but still come back here because of how well they operate. I cannot recommend this location enough! I've been to at least 12 Robertos."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Valle Verde Casino for what we called \"Taco Tuesday\". They have really good tacos (3 for $3.99). We got tired of driving that far on week nights so we thought we'd grab some tacos at Roberto's (in spite of the fact that they changed their name). I have eaten at Roberto's before and it was good but this wasn't so nice. They wanted $5 each taco and their rolled taco dinner was my only reasonable option so I got it and a couple tacos. Yuck! Brand and over priced for takeout Mexican food. Will make tacos at home next Tuesday."}
{"text":"Luv there chicken tacos, as long as they don't fry them to long. My boyfriend luvs the carne asada burritos. We also tried the rolled tacos, they weren't to good reminded me a lot of the frozen taquitos you would buy at the store."}
{"text":"It's a great place open late. Love their specials and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First off, I love Mexican food so I know what to look for. I have to have my hot sauce just right and the food cooked to perfection.  I have to say that they make their food just right for me. I ordered a carnitas burrito and the meat was fried perfectly and very well marinated.  Only one negative thing was I'm not convinced the meat was fresh.  I can kinda taste thw meat a bit stale. Kinda sucks cause everything else was perfect. I'll give this place another try and update a new review.66"}
{"text":"Not as good as other locations. They are stingy with how much meat they stuff in the burritos and they don't know how to wrap a burrito. My order was cold and the meat tasted old. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best fast food mexican stops around. I'm from California and they don't have many Roberto's around here but I wish they did. Yes the food is a bit greasy and yes they mess up my order from time to time but it just taste so good. Their super nachos are the best I've ever had anywhere. Try their super nancho with carnitas and hold the beans. Their even open 24 hours a day!"}
{"text":"bad experience in this restaurant burrito was not to my order, had to ask them 3 times why there was no cheese. no refill on horchata at this location and they overcharge for a drink. thinking about making pepes my go to place for now on. also called corporate and they seem to not care. not recommended at all,  beware! !!"}
{"text":"Extremely greasy!  Cheap prices, but you get what you pay for I guess. We have tried breakfast and lunch - neither was good."}
{"text":"Not happy at all w/this establishment!  Too start off w/the lady behind counter looked at us if we were speaking Chinese & No Acknowledgement when we asked her something.  2nd, ordered a #6 & got something else instead.  3rd I ordered Menudo & I wasn't impressed w/it. I always thought it came with hominy but, apparently Not this order? Way too spicy & the Tripe looked & tasted old.  Would've been better to get Juanitas in the can!  Needless to say won't be coming back here.  Not sure how others who commented previously got good food & service?  Everyone has an off day I guess?  Too bad it had to be me..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I can take a little bad service but the food sucks. Can't see how this place is still open. I rather go to Taco Bell across the street instead. Lol That's pretty bad."}
{"text":"never never never go to this location!!! im a big robertos fan being from california, but the service was so bad at this particular location i actually had to log on and warn u guys against it!! the guy behind the register was like high or something, lazy, unfriendly and ..forgot my drink once all was said and done.just kinda rude.. i was in a good mood when i came in and so shocked at the service or lack of ,i wanted to run out in the end. if youre new to vegas and gotta have that bomb mexican let me suggest the other location on gibson theyre way better."}
{"text":"Woooooorrrrssstttttttt robertos ever  I promise u. I come down here for drive thru and these bastards about 98% of the time never give me what I asked for!!!I always have to check the food and drive back because of missing items. The bathroom is untidy and unkept and they don't really care about messing up your order. I have been to some messed up robertos but the consistency with this one is what kills me. Consistent at messing my order up without fail,no apology just like o well. This is the last time!!! They don't deserve even one star!!!"}
{"text":"carnitas burrito was tasty and inexpensive.  hit the spot after hiking near lake mead.  service was fast."}
{"text":"I heard so much about Roberto's this,Roberto's that...but the beef blew and I was probably better off going to del taco like I was going to."}
{"text":"OKAY so im not a big fan of this place,but everything else is soo far from me. I will say though I do enjoy the carne asada fries hold the pico. I also love grabbing some cucumbers and radishes mix in some lime and salt and BAM awesome snack!"}
{"text":"The food was well prepared, and in good timing. But the staff could be friendlier. When asked for special request (add cheese  etc.) they were almost irritated. They didn't greet/acknowledge or say thank you when we tipped them. One other time my friend ordered Carne Asada nachos, and they gave her fries so she politely took it up to the counter and let them know she had ordered nachos and they rolled their eyes and grabbed it from her and said nothing. I understand there are difficult customers, and that gets irritating, but when the customer is nicer than the staff it's a problem. Would still eat here and will continue to be kind to them even when I don't get it back."}
{"text":"Ordered a $7 breakfast burrito and the wanted to charge me $3 for pico de gallo.  Then they laughed at me when I thought that was too high. Needless to say, I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Wow. That lady is so rude. Food is good, but that lady has the worst service ever. She is always angry and has a dirty look on her face. She is very impolite and makes you not want to come back again."}
{"text":"This location has gone way down hill.   I'd rather eat at the gas station next store."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but why is it that tacos come with only guacamole and pico de gallo?? They want a 1.50 more for lettuce and 1.50 more for cheese???? I know that normally a taco comes with at least cheese and lettuce. On top of that the lady was wonderful but the rice was still uncooked.... I've always loved this location but lately they've gone to the way side and I'm not to sure I'll be back.. This would be the second time I have received uncooked crunchy rice. The 2 stars is for the service and quality in meat...."}
{"text":"Went to Tony Moreno Salon and had a few minutes to spare and saw Roberto's Taco Shop right next door.  Tried the rolled tacos and they were delicious.  Will definitely be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can order carne asada every time.  it's overcooked low quality beef and they don't season it at all.  Maybe they just don't know any better.  my recommendation is the breakfast burrito with chorizo or sausage and a pina or pineapple jarritos.  Goes perfect.  Don't forget the salsa and lime bar.  Just a note, the smaller container of salsa is the HOT or pipe cleaning salsa, which I prefer.  Good ole robertos.  Probably healthier than taco bell.  The cleanest, best, most amazing tacos are waiting for you on tropicana at taco tijuana.  Usually tho, in a joint like this, simpler is better.  For example, bean and cheese, bean and rice, bean and egg, bean and... whatever you can think of.  Don't forget the salsa and lime... and jalapeno if you're man enough."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite.The carne asada burritos are the best here. The meat is cooked fresh and the portions are big. The restaurant is always clean and the service quick. I eat here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"The cheese enchiladas are mind blowing! The rice and beans were cooked great as well. The chicken burrito was not the best burrito I ever had and was actually dripping with liquid. The employees were very friendly and attentive. Would recommend and go back to try other options."}
{"text":"So the staff is super cool, and the shop is super clean. However, I'm not sure if the chains have changed recipes or what. I've been to three different locations (Maryland and Hacienda, Boulder and Russell and this location) and the food is not the greatest anymore. For years it's been a great fast food meets authentic type spot. But my last few trips, tasted more like Hungry Man TV dinners honestly. There's a Taco y Taco directly across the street from me, but I've had a soft spot in my heart for Roberto's. Guess I'll make the switch..."}
{"text":"I'm a noob to this place.  I had no idea it was a franchise until I looked at the back of the carryout menu because inside it kind of looks like a hole in the wall.   After seeing the words \"Taco's 24 hours\" in the window I thought, \"I'm in the Southwest and this is a taco place, go now.\"  So I did.   Beef taco and Chicken taco, 10 minute wait, tray table full of condiments from pickled hot peppers, carrots, green and red sauces.   The taco's?  Oh my sweet gracious underwear.  Never had any this good in Michigan.    The peppers were huge and the heat and flavor were balanced so nice.   I went back 2 more times while in this area.  Wednesday was 99 cent chicken taco day.  The other items were ok but tacos (especially the chicken) were where it was at."}
{"text":"My son and I resolved never to eat here again. We ordered chicken tacos and it smelled gross and tasted gross and we couldnt even finish our tacos. The next day I had the runs!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! Whoever takes the order from the phone is super ghetto. Not only she is rude, she puts you on hold(she doesn't push hold button btw so I can hear her conversation with 5 different customers) for 5 min and when I hang up the phone to call back, since she hasn't hang up the phone on her end, the line is busy... It's a shame that this place is good but thanks to an nice angel I won't be going here... I know it's not a luxury restaurant but she needs to learn the customer service. Don tortaco is much nicer"}
{"text":"I was exited because it was close to our home. We like eating at Robert's the only problem is the smell, once you walked in. They have this some kind of smell that you really don't enjoy  what your eating because the inside takes over the whole place. I a m not sure what kind of cleaning chemicals they used but that need to change it right now. we go to another location right by fort Apache & Flamingo. The sad part is we live next to this one. Honestly waiting for it to open now heartbroken because we have to drive further. Please figure out what that smell we would gladly come back to eat at your location.  Thank you.. We like this place by the way."}
{"text":"I went to Robertos after church and ordered a Torta, I specifically asked for NO ONIONS, even the little girl next to me repeated it to the people behind the counter. I hate onions from a bad experience as a child! And I really feel like they put extra on the Torta just to be rude! I had to have my granddaughter help me pick them off. What an awful experience all around"}
{"text":"Adobada burrito / taco! It's what I do and all I eat ;) although the rolled chicken tacos are also scrumptious! So many locations it's def a good filling meal! And to top it off 24/7 just about anywhere in the valley! My favorite Mexican fast food shop all the way!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Roberto's location I've tried in the area. It's clean and the staff is usually pretty fast with getting out the orders. I appreciate how the tacos are made fresh to order and I also appreciate how the food is made in the order in which the orders are placed. It can be obnoxious, for example, if the person in front of you orders 16 tacos and you have to wait your turn to get your 2 tacos. But, like I said, they work pretty fast. The only thing I can complain about here is that the parking lot sucks."}
{"text":"Great place for that late night craving for great Mexican food! Definitely recommend this place to the bean and cheese burrito lovers as well as the carne asada fries! I'd choose this robertos over other ones because they have the thing crispy fries that blend well with all the trimmings."}
{"text":"Love love love their breakfast burritos and the fact that they're open 24 hours.  The lady who always seems to be on shift whenever I stop in is friendly, quick, and efficient."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito, rolled tacos and carne asada fries.....All awesome and open 24 hours"}
{"text":"My go to spot if I want a quick Mexican lunch or a breakfast burrito. I always get the breakfast burrito a bit later ish in the morning cause it's at times it's super busy. Wednesday are their busiest days in my opinion.   Other than that their carne asada burrito could be better but you get what you pay for.   Their carne asada fries are really good, it's becoming my go to spot if I'm craving that, and it's location is great for UNLV students or ppl around Maryland in between Tropicana and Flamingo.   I see this as must to try seeing that there is a number of Roberto's around the LV area."}
{"text":"Close to home style tex-mex. We've tried two of the stores,  and the food is consistently good.  Beef enchiladas come with lettuce topping and most importantly, shredded beef. The chimichangas are good,  and the burros are okay,  too.  We don't eat out often,  but when we do,  we appreciate value for money. Robertos offers that."}
{"text":"I will say the food was good until the service ruined it on me.  The lady behind the counter was being relatively rude, and when I got my plate, it had a short blond hair among the cheese.  She refused to replace it stating it was mine.  I have brown hair, inexcusable."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a lot of robertos. But I can't imagine many being much worse  No soap in bathroom. No lock on stall door. No napkins on tables. No plastic utensils to pick from. No water cups.  Clientele  leaves a lot to be desired.   Shame cause food was good and taco shells were soft"}
{"text":"Carne asada nachos, burritos and the chicken tacos are great.  I love the food, service and prices.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Roberto's has been a mainstay to the Las Vegas Valley for decades. I've never been disappointed. Quick good food."}
{"text":"Clean inside, 24hrs,  inexpensive, cooks are quick to make your food and it tastes good.  Not much more you can ask for.  There's a self serve salsa bar too."}
{"text":"Attention now serving food poisoning, fake mexican food, need to be shut down. Pls stay away. I just bought a burrito in the the couple hours into the day started throwing up  there are better Mexican restaurants around the valley do not waste your money at these crappy Ass  fake Mexican food joint. The cooks behind the counters probably don't give a shit and they'll serve whatever they probably don't even give a shit about proper food handling stay away from these places trust me"}
{"text":"Never fails to satisfy. This place is busy. I love it. Taco Wednesdays means get there early. Food portions are big and the place does not smell like old oil. The crew is fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"Legitimate Mexican food.  Really good tamales. Friendly staff, fast and good.  I was yelping a restaurant close to my hotel, but I would go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"I just walked out of there with my dad. We had the worst food! The meat was spoiled and I felt the urger to vomit when I smelled my taco. Not a place I would return to!"}
{"text":"I like Roberto's but this one is the worst.  The store is roughly the size of your bathroom but they make up for it by being extremely slow.  Pick another Roberto's or make sure you have a lot of time on your hands before you go here and that you enjoy eating standing up."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Mexican food water but this place is the bomb an Wednesday is 99 chicken taco day"}
{"text":"Roberto's is just OK.  I much prefer Fausto's.  Only benefit to Roberto's is there are many more locations than Faustos and open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever!! Ordered a Burrito de Lengua. I got home took a bite and there was no rice or beans. I asked the guy to put avocado on it. Nothing! Very disappointed. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Love it. Great food. Always fresh and hot when I pick it up. The grill is clean and so is the facility. They don't skimp on the food like a few others. The service is great. I pay with cash so the $.50 charge the other reviewer freaked out about is no issue. And every Roberto's charges for debit and credit."}
{"text":"Great food, one of the better Robertos in the valley. Meat is cooked on the spot as opposed to being pre cooked like other places are known to do. The food is great overall, with every item having a distinctly different taste from the others in the chain. Definetely worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"In town on vacation and wanted to get some good tacos. Being from St Louis we dont have the variety of mexican that is available in Vegas. We really liked the food at this location, carna asada tacos with guac and pice were VERY good and fish tacos a close second.You can get a good meal affordibly and they are open 24 hrs"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had the chimi. It was delicious. I definitely recommend this as a \"must try\". Cheap and filling!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Roberto's Taco Shop near the crib. I can finally get my Carne Asada Nachos fix anytime I want. No more, \"Man, it's too far to drive\" or \"But Jack in the Box got the dopest Raspberry Iced Tea\" or \"I'm in the middle of watching this dope scene on BangBros\" excuses anymore. Well maybe if I am watching a dope scene with Amy Reid. That chick is slammin. But you know what I don't like about the scenes nowadays? When they look in the camera when they not supposed to. Kinda of turn off. You know us asians, we love them white girls. But you know what else asians love? A Carne Asada Burrito with no guacamole and extra cheese."}
{"text":"Rolled tacos are skimpy an dry . I didn't try the other stuff this time I have I'm the past the burritos were good exspecailly the breakfast one its a taste of home cooking keep up the good work family"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  price is right. Obviously not there for the ambiance. Although, no problem sitting down and eating at the tables which were all clean."}
{"text":"This place is awful!! I used to eat there every once in a while and they almost never got my order right so I stopped going... My roommate was going there so I thought I would give them another chance so he just brought us back food... I got the two beef taco meal...yeah my order was right!!  Ate the beans... Great everything was fine... Take a bite out of my taco and found a piece of wood in it!!!!!!!!! This place is horrible and I am done eating there!!! Eat at your own risk!!!"}
{"text":"Not all tacos are created the same...and for this visit, I was all about the carne asada nachos. Definitely a treat"}
{"text":"Mmmm...Wednesday is chicken taco day. Only 99 cents!!"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service. Food is good but the lady at front had a horrible attitude. This is not the first time it happens, she seems to be always in a bad mood. I live close and like their food but I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Of all the roberto's this location is my favorite.  I order one thing only, and thats carne asada fries.  There is nothing better."}
{"text":"I called a simple burrito to be picked up in 10 min...., and 15 min later I go in and it's not even ready. There's a reason I called it in to be picked up, if I wanted to wait even a second longer than needed, I wouldn't have called. Good food, but badly executed service"}
{"text":"The place seemed clean. As I was about to walk in. An employee stopped me and told me it was closing time. It's ok. Kind of odd how she almost jogged to the door to stop me though. Lol I couldn't help to laugh a little. I took some pics of the place for all the neighbors."}
{"text":"I might a bit of a snob when it comes to tacos being from southern Cal, but Roberto's is really good. This location is my favorite in town - you would think they would all be the same, but this location is the best.  The portions are big, the food is cheap, and it tastes good. It's a little greasy, but hey, it is a taco shop. All of the meats are marinated and have good flavor. The burritos are awesome and huge, tacos come fried or soft shell, and then the Super Nachos.... I think these  break the maximum calorie barrier, but they are good.  Staff here is nice. They are quick, good cooks, and the cashiers will joke around with you on occasion.  No alcohol here, but the place is connected to a bar.  We have a different Roberto's closer to us and we drive a little out of the way for this one. Good place, good food."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon. First bite was delicious with exception that it had an eggshell. But it didn't bother me as much. Until I took the second bite. With more eggshell and then the third bite and more eggshell. Then I decided to just throw it out. If you can't crack an egg, you seriously have issues. I like this place and eat here a lot. Will continue to come back but please LEARN HOW TO CRACK AN EGG NEXT TIME."}
{"text":"Awesome taco shop! I go there every Saturday after the club with my homeboys and the carne asada fries are my FAVORITE !!!!!!! Can't forget those spicy jalapeno juiced up carrots either !!!!! 5 stars !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican't food. Factory made chicken tamales containing rehydrated red bell pepper and corn? Woah! Not to mention the rock hard taquitos, scarce of meat. The rice was really salty too. What happened to quality control? There are too many taco shops to count but I'll count this place out from here on out."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Mexican fast food place in Nevada !!  and like the others have said this place is really clean...."}
{"text":"When i visit my son and his wife i have to eat at Robertos!! My favorite. Love the enchiladas. Visiting soon, so cat wait!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place, but just haven't really ever had a good meal here.  It's a bit grungy every time I go in, and the burritos are usually dry and flavorless.  It wasn't even good after 14 beers."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I have been a customer for a long time because it's so close to home, and it is because of this specific restaurant that I have built the habit of checking my food before leaving or eating. They have a consistency for getting my order wrong yet, I order the same thing every time. How this place can get my order wrong so many times is beyond my comprehension.  1/5 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Roberto's has the best carne asada burritos and the fixin's at the salsa bar are tasty. Red and green sauce and spicy carrots and lime wedges . Also enjoy the 3 rolled tacos with guc .I do agree with some of the reviews about the place being a mess. But that is some of the appeal to most taco shops. I mean risking your life for good tacos and burritos is exciting and I also agree this place is perfect after a late night of drinking."}
{"text":"worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce. My husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was \"combo?\" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said \"well just this once\". No apology, no customer service  . I would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back."}
{"text":"Disgusting service..i ordered a total of three items and everytime I added to my order the cashier would look back at the cook and tell him to make it pissed off and the cook would throw the tortillas on the grill with an attitude I asked if he could add chicken to my burrito and he said no I have to buy it the way it's on the menu I asked him to sell me a side of chicken and I'd do it myself he said ok .at the end he put the chicken in the burrito ..made an issue of it just because..lazy ass paisa..then he rushed me out of the restaurant once my order was ready ..disgrace to the race ..pinche porqueria de servicio"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from Robertos which is awesome cuz I love this place. From their BIG breakfast burritos to their GIANT chimichangas, this place has it all. $1 chicken tacos on Wednesdays are great as well. A little oily but still good. The only thing i think they should change is that they should make their own in-house horchata instead of the machine one. Other than that this place is fire!!!!"}
{"text":"The fish burritos, nachos, and combo plates from Roberto's are simply awesome!  A fish burrito contains two big breaded fish planks, loads of cabbage, salsa and tartar sauce, and probably weighs about a pound and a half, and is only five bucks.  The chicken and carne asada burritos are loaded and delicious as well.    I think the shrimp burrito recipe needs to be revamped, but I can overlook this in favor of all the things that they do absolutely perfectly.  The salsa bar is also awesome, and they have plenty of little plastic cups with snap-on lids to take salsa to go.  It's preservative free and therefore highly perishable, but that is a sign of great quality.  They also have whole jalapenos and pickled spicy veggies if that's your thing, just sitting there for free in a container in a bed of ice.  The locations my wife and I frequent are both close to UNLV.  One is directly across from the campus on Maryland Parkway and Harmon, behind the 7-11 store.  The other is in a really spotty neighborhood near Paradise and Twain I think.  Definitely a couple of bright spots in what otherwise consists mostly of everyday fast food chains!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is what it is - good Mexican takeout available 24/7. My favorites are the carne asada burrito and the chicken tacos. I will also take one of their breakfast burritos any time of day."}
{"text":"Love Robertos!  This is the food i miss living a long plane ride away.  I go to this place every day at random hours and am never disappointed.  Great folks working there that are awesome duringa rush or when slow.  Food is served quickly, hot and once i start i am unable to stop eating until all my food is gone.  I will be dreaming about their food!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service and mediocre food. They put cheese on everything whether you ask for it or not. Made me think what are they hiding \"under\" all this cheese?!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada fries are super white-washed but nevertheless delicious!! One of the best places to get authentically Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was brought here by my boyfriend while visiting Las Vegas because he loves this place and so do a lot of the people at his job. We both had the Carne Asada Fries (about $7). The serving size was very generous, you could easily split it between 2 to 3 people. I would have it again.  Side note: the bae is from San Diego and loves him some California burritos and Carne Asada fries so he's picky about the kind he has."}
{"text":"You call that a California Burrito?  Las Vegans... that's not a Caifornia Burrito.  Don't believe what you hear; a California Burrito does NOT equal salsa, no guacamole, or \"healthy.\"  The perfect California Burrito is debatable.  But mine is a big fat burrito (and you call your burritos burritos?  Those are flautas as far as I'm concerned) with greasy carne asada, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, and FRENCH FRIES!!!  Oh Roberto's please add the french fries to your California Burritos and give a San Diego-girl a taste of home after she goes grocery shopping at Smith's!  BTW, we got our first taste of good old-fashioned racism when this haolie asked my BF what was better Chow King or Roberto's.  I was sitting down putting our salsa in the bag and I was SOO confused by how the two are even related.  They aren't!  He just asked because we're Asian... and my BF isn't even Filipino!  I busted up laughing but I know he didn't mean anything by it.  Personally, that was the best taco shop story ever."}
{"text":"This is the closest Roberto's to us since moving up to the Aliante area and we love our breakfast burritos!  Glad to find out that this place makes them just as good as other locations we used to frequent before moving to this side of town.  The burritos are intact, this place has every kind of meat offered elsewhere and they are not dripping in grease from excess cheese!  Timely service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The cashier took for ever to take my order and when  we finally got our food, it was burnt!!! BURNT! Definitely  not  going back. I'm only giving one start because I have to."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced for this big California burrito I got. It was delicious! I went there late at night and the two gents were very nice and patient with me. Answered my questions very informatively."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place one night after a long night of drinking for a \"little\" snack.  I have some friends in Vegas and one of them took us here as he used to go to UNLV which is across the street.  The best part is that they are open 24 hours so you can go in anytime you please with the exception of Christmas which they are closed.  Anyways, back to the food - I ordered a carne asada burrito and it had a lot of meat in it.  I would  have to say that it was pretty good and definitely hit the spot.  The salsa was really good too, especially the rojo salsa which was really hot but it didn't matter as I enjoy spicy food.  The food is pretty cheap and definitely good for a late night meal.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best carne asada burritos I've ever had.. I would've given them 5 stars but it bothers me that the cheese and sour cream were both an extra dollar.. Still well worth it but come on.."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout here around four or five times now and enjoyed the food. Wife gets either tacos or rolled tacos and I get either bean and cheese burrito or chicken burrito. The bean burritos are large and very tasty. The chicken burrito is a little bland until you spice it up but you get a ton of shredded chicken. The only place where a single burrito fills me up. We also get an order fries to share and are pleased with the large serving for very little money.  A couple times when we walked in there was a strong smell of a pine-sol type of cleaner which would kind of spoil the taste of the food if you ate there, but it's nice to know they clean the place.  Always a good idea to check your order before you leave. Once they left an item off the order, so I had to make a second purchase and wait for that order. it happens."}
{"text":"Omg! The California burrito is SSSOOO good!!! I hate my coworker for introducing me to it just because I don't want to gain 100 this week. How can French fries make a burrito taste so much better?! The only thing I thought was ridiculous was the price to add sour cream. It's $1.10 just for sour cream!! $1.10 is just a little excessive I think .30 would be more reasonable. Not going to lie tonight I am planning on going to get my burrito then putting sour cream on it when I get home. :) when I die I hope these California burritos are in heaven and that it doesn't cost to add sour cream :)"}
{"text":"I solely eat at this place out of convenience due to its 24 hour open drive thru and accessible location. However the food is decent and the price to food ratio is excellent. There isn't much to complain."}
{"text":"Terrible! Usually I like good ol bobbys but this time, no Bueno! The tomales were \"ehh\" drowned in cheese. More like cheese tomales sprinkled with a bit of meat. Also worth noting, I ordered polo and got beef. But the worst part has to be the constant jibber jabbering & laughing in espanol while I'm waiting for food. Were they laughing at me? Probably. It's ok though. I won't lose sleep over it Mijos. Maybe less chatter and more cooking would result in better tomales and correct orders. Orale vato locos!"}
{"text":"I love the carne Asada fries and the cashier is so sweet .. only thing that didn't make this a 4 or 5 star is the floors and booths were dirty but could of been a short handed night there"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's 3am in the morning.  I work until 3am on Sunday nights and class at 8am on Monday.  If I go to sleep, I cannot wake up until 11am.... So I always go to this Roberto's to grab breakfast and sit for 2 to 3 hours reading.  Reading at Roberto's?  It is quite weird but I got use to it.    The only thing about this location is that sometimes Homeless people come to purchase a drink and they sleep at a booth... The staff there is also very friendly regardless of the late hour.  The food is decent.  It's not the best Mexican food ever, but I like it. My favorites are fish tacos and California burrito.  I recently tried the fish burrito but I think tacos are way better just because the fish stays crispy with the taco wrap.  So I like this location."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible after I called and complained about our order being wrong. Drove back to get correct order and employee was very rude and wouldn't give us rest of order without paying more money."}
{"text":"Pase por una orden de 6 mini tacos por el drive thru con guacamole cada taco bale 1.50$ y por incluirle guacamole era 1.20$ por taco dije ni pedo con q esten buenos bale la pena page 19.41$ yego ala casa y ningun pinshe taco traia guacamole wtf, pero si me dieron una libra de zanaoria con cebolla. NO RECOMENDADOS"}
{"text":"This place has always been solid, but after today, I'll never eat here again. 5-21. 730pm. The lady running the drive through was rude and argumentative. She got loud with us and didn't respond to our questions. It's too bad. I loved this place."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place, I've lived in this area for 4 years and finally, I'm fed up with this place... The food isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Just another Mexican restaurant. But ever since the change in ownership, the employees especially the girls that work the drive thru are slow, and they don't listen. Hot do you ask what kind of sauce you want, red or green ? You tell them red, but they give you nothing but verde sauce... The New ownership needs to hire some people that can work a drive thru window, to take your order get it right and get you out...!!! It shouldn't take 7 minutes for rolled tacos..."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious and cheap.  Some of the Roberto's around town seem cleaner than others, but the food is good at all of the ones I have been to."}
{"text":"I would love to give them a higher rating. For the most part I like their food. Had an excellent burrito , best ever Chile relleno,  good menudo which I go for on the weekends.  But last night I had a cheese enchilada with my chile relleno and they forgot to cook it. Yes, cheese was not melted and it was cold. I couldn't  get to my microwave to heat it because we are remodeling - which is why I went out for food.  Then I realized I couldn't even complain nor call. Going back next time and asking them to please make sure they cook my food properly is not possible. No one there speaks English. So in the past when I got corn tortillas instead of flower I ate them. You see, no speak English.  My feeling is that if one has an eating establishment in America please respect your clients and be able to serve them properly. I also like to go out for sushi but I don't need to speak Japanese. I like Italian food but I'm normally served in English and if I have a complaint I am able to voice it. Is that too much to ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm honestly forced to give this place one star because it deserves none! The service was terrible and the food was a joke. We ordered a carne asada quesadilla, an order of carne asada nachos and one carnitas burrito.   Okay, let me start by saying that the asada on the nachos was cold and the meat did NOT look fresh! By the time the nachos made it to our table, not only was the meat cold, but the nachos were soggy. My son's favorite item on the menu is their carne asada quesadilla. He took 3 bites before complaining that there was a piece that was too \" chewy\" to swallow. He ended up spitting it out and refusing to eat. He walked out with a stomach ache. Now, for the burrito -which I was most disgusted by- tasted very gamy, and not in a good way.   Finally, you know how I mentioned their burrito was what disgusted me most? We'll, I take it back! What could be worse? Their customer service! I'll admit that it's partly my fault for disregarding the red flags, because there were many. For starters being asked to calculate my own total balance seems absurd. Yes, you heard right. I gave him my order twice and while taking it, he was giving me this look as if I was stupid. He gave me my balance and forgot to add my drinks. Then as he was adding my drinks I decided to add the burrito. He looked at me and said, \"okay just get your phone an add $1.70 for drinks and $5.65 for the burrito, that's your balance.\"   The experience was terrible! They were rude and stared the whole time we were there! Singing loudly and intentionally trying to make us feel uncomfortable. What a night!"}
{"text":"Stopped here at 1 am one night to check it out.   *Food*: I have to say, I had the burrito with the Carne Asada, it was unbelievable. Bigger than I expected, which was nice because I was starving. Fully of high quality meat and ingredients. Great flavors. The rice and beens on the side were meh but the burrito compensated.   *Service*: The kid at the counter was actually really nice. And the food came up quite quickly.   *Price*: This is where it lost a star. The $7+ meal was too much for me. I think $5 would have been about right. If the sides \"wowed\" maybe $6 but overall it seemed a bit too pricey for a taco shop.   Nonetheless it was a great meal."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that Roberto's has often been the destination my family and I would eat at. We normally love the food, however, food can only go so far when it comes to customer service. I am unsure if all locations follow the same \"uncaring\" attitude this location seemed to have, but for the sake of the business, I hope not.   Tonight we ordered 2 beef burritos along with a variety of other dishes for carryout. We often find ourselves spending  well over 30-40 dollars for the entire family, and we do this quite often throughout the year. The 2 beef burritos were EXTREMELY salty, and we decided to call the location and ask for 2 new burritos to be made, specifically Carne Asada. The employee began to tell us that there is absolutely no salt in the ingredients list for the burrito, which I found very hard to believe. We decided to go to the store and speak with her, but the best response I could get was \"It's not my problem you didn't like the food, it's your problem.\" Also, we were going to be held responsible for paying the difference for an order that was already misunderstood to begin with, and in theory, pay for the burritos that tasted awful. I cut many companies slack that support outstanding customer service because it is in human nature to make mistakes, and if the company is going to compensate for their misunderstandings and mistakes, there is no reason to be upset. A company that does not exercise this notion is destined to lose customers, and as one myself, I will find it very hard to mention Roberto's in the next conversation that includes dinner options."}
{"text":"The food is great at this place. Have been to many other Roberto's but this is the best one. Food always tastes good and fresh. Will keep eating at this location"}
{"text":"Called in order at 3:30 pm.  Ordered 2 burritos and carne asada fries.  They told me it would be ready in 10 min.  Arrived art 3:40. As I was paying the cashier told cook to make order.  It's now 4pm 30 min late and I'm waiting for order.  There was 4 customers in restaurant when I arrived...  The whole point of calling in order is to eliminate or reduce wait time.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This was all I wanted to eat after my mega 15 hour NYE shift. I had the California burrito loaded with flavor and all kinds of goodness. I've had many things from here over the years, and I'm not sure why this place has gotten some of its unfavorable reviews? It's simple, it's good. No complaints from me! I love the carne asada fries especially, but try not to eat them too often as I'm watching my girlish Gremlin figure. A+, Roberto's. Keep it yummy! xo"}
{"text":"Great mexican food to get while your hungover or drunk."}
{"text":"You have just lost my business by removing the Carne asada burrito combo from the special!! I'm now sitting in Don Tortaco ordering the same meal that you want $17.95 for $11.00 if you don't believe me try it for yourself. Carne Asada burrito combo with rice and beans, a side of two Cheese enchiladas and a large fountain drink is $17.95!!! This isn't  on the strip either it's in southern highlands."}
{"text":"All customers were there complaining I was waiting for my coworkers as I experienced nasty service she tried blaming her cooks, if she would have had better customer service skills my coworkers and I would have stayed now I'm going to eat subway hopefully their customer service is 100x better than this robertos."}
{"text":"This place has fairly low reviews, although I'm not sure why. The food is good, the salsa is HOT, and it has take out. I'm visiting Vegas and its a good place to grab some food, especially since it is so close. Bean and cheese burrito= delicioso!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Always fresh and hot off the grill. Of course with good food needs good service. I usually go late night and the staff there most of the time seems to hate that their there. In no way are they rude, but they just don't seem to care.  Regardless, you can't expect too much from a drive through Mexican restaurant. The food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I love their California Burritos.  Reason for the 3 stars?  Something funny, I think the cheese they use at this Roberto's taste different than the other's I've been to.  Also the the french fries they put in the burrito is consistently undercooked.  Other Roberto's restaurants seem to cook them better.    Tip:  If you want to try a similar taco shop, try Faustos.  There's one up on College and Horizon next to Panda Expres.  Their CA burrito has carne asada, rice, guac, sour cream, and cheese... pretty good!  And their carnes asada fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"I miss the Tommy Pastrami's that was in this location, but my Carne Asada Fries are biking distance now. So, not much of a loss.  I notice very little deviance from the other Roberto's locations, which means this is \"the\" taco shop with a duplicate-able sense of business.   This particular location does offer green onions in the salsa bar, which is a plus, but while self-serve salsa bars seems to be a trend in Mexican cuisine, I would not trust the area with these gringos. Remember, these are the same guys that taught terrorists to fly but not land, and why Las Vegas businesses have such a false sense of security. So, if they can't police their own safety, what makes you think they can handle a salsa bar. I've posted similar concerns with U-Swirl and Yogurtland. Self serve areas in food service is a foolish idea, especially in a fast food atmosphere.  Nonetheless, I come here for machaca, chorizo, and breakfast burritos. This is also my place for quesadillas and horchata; perfect amount of cinnamon. I do wish they had tacos de cabeza. The only location I remember seeing this was at Maryland near UNLV.   I dine out a lot over the past 30+ years, and I only got sick at Jack-in-the-box (twice) and Burger King once. So, this place is the cleanest of its kind, and the service is also really fast.   I think I'll go there now.  _______________________________________-____-_____ Well, I just came back from there, and I was slightly peeved.  The salsa bar was amazingly messier than any time I've ever seen it, and it was only 9:30 in the morning.  I ordered my regular carne asada fries but I wasn't in the mood to eat a whole order, and since they only have one size, I asked them to put it into 2 separate smaller containers instead. She said they could not do that for me. But she was able to give me 2 empty small containers along with my regular order.  The adjustment is very small and would take only 10 seconds to split the ingredients into 2 smaller containers. That kind of inflexibility shows me some inexperience with the cooks. The service was still fast, but what was once a 4 star place has dropped one whole star because they could not accommodate such a minor request. I went home and took a spatula and split it myself. It took 5 seconds, but the ingredients did not adhere like the original prepared presentation. If they did it I would be happy. But like most businesses in the US, it's not their job to make me happy- nor is it my job to tip them."}
{"text":"I think this location is starting to go downhill. Lately im less happy with what I order. Tonight I ordered chicken chimichanga, carne asada nachos, and a chicken burrito. The chicken was barely shredded there were huge chunks that made it hard to bite into and gave it a dry feeling. The chips were burnt and the burrito size is much smaller. Also im pretty sure they left out a couple ingredients in all the dishes I ordered. Good for a quick late night meal if youve been drinking though."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous.  Please don't mistake this as a 5 star restaurant because it is not.  It is however, a wonderful restaurant with plenty of options.  The food is made fresh.  Looking forward to many trips back!"}
{"text":"I hate that MOST of the Roberto's cooks never wear gloves while cooking food ! They even sprinkle the cheese with their bare hands! Disgusting !!!!!!"}
{"text":"ok, if you've been living in vegas, you've had to try this place at least once.  i was pretty skeptical at first.  it's not a pretty place.  it's not the cleanest place.  it's simple and just serves good mexican food.  its not healthy eater, so dieters beware.  the hot steaming crispy carnitas plate is so delicious.  the HUGUNGOUS nacho platter is full of chunks of meat and cheeeeze.  all the burritos are good with any of the meat choices.  this place is so damn good after a night out with mr jack daniels.  then you have to wash it down with a cold glass of horchata.  this place is hella cool b/c it has a condiment stand with cut cucumber, the canned jalapenos soaked in vinegar w/ carrots, cut radish, onions, cilantro, and cut lemons.  this is how i love to eat any of their dishes and how i recommend eating there.   basically sprinle your favorite heat (hot sauce), then squeeze some lemon juice, take a bite of the jalapeno and squeeze out the tangy vinegar on to whatever you eat like a taco, burrito, or even the nachos.  the flavors are just crazy in your mouth, but ho---ho  damn good.  there are so many roberto's in this city.  this particular one and all of them are one of the best hole in the walls in vegas.  i've been to a pt pub on nellis on the east side and it literally had a hole in the wall that connected to roberto's.  WOW,  i can drink beer and get some good-ass roberto's  food.  i was sad to find out that i did not have one down the street from me, but in due time there will be one....ha..ha...ha"}
{"text":"Late nights can lead to hunger.  And when they do, if you're in Vegas, find Roberto's.  Each and every time I've been here, the folks there treat me well and feed me well also.  I have yet to have a bad experience there nor a bad meal.  Carne asada fries, mmmm mmmmmm MMMMMMMM!! Rolled tacos, also good.  That's what I had on my last visit.  I cannot wait until I get back to this place to eat all the foods!!"}
{"text":"I love their steak burrito and all the foods are great but.. the cashier cant understand english and speaking english. yet, all foods are really really great!"}
{"text":"This place is open late, I think 24 hours, and the carnitas are good. The meat is juicy, tender and not too fatty. They had good salsa and a little bar to grab limes and jalepenos and what nots. People working were really friendly and the food came out fast. I had them alter my order a little and there was no problem with my changes. Guacamole came with, which was a nice surprise.  Prices are fair. Also they use lard to cook with, not Crisco but lard. That may sound gross but I appreciate it because I'm allergic to soy, which is used in so many fast food joints making them off limits to me, so now that I know I will hit Roberto's up more often!"}
{"text":"great food  great price. probably the best to go tacos ever! it is casual dining.. but the food is awesome!!   keep up the great work"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. My boyfriend & I went here to eat very late night after I got off of work & we were both starving. He ordered the rolled beef tacos, I ordered the steak tostada. When we got our food & started eating I noticed that more than 50% or more of my meat was way under cooked, & mostly all fatty tendens stuck together in one huge ball. Other customers enjoying their meals next to me noticed me holding it in the air, they we're disgusted as well. It was as if I had got the end of the scraps bag. I took it back up to the counter & explained how I couldn't eat it & asked if it was possible to trade in what I had for 1 rolled beef taco. No not 1 order of the tacos...just 1 small rolled beef taco. The chick at the windows body language was as if I had offended her & everyone she worked with. She told me no & that the beef would be the exact same even tho I knew better considering my boyfriends food was just fine. So I asked for my money back & she wouldn't even do that. So in the end I paid for something I didn't get to eat & almost threw up from the disgusting overload of tendens & fat. I'll never go here again, which in turn looses business for the shell. Keep that in mind shell."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an expertly cooked and delicious chorizo burrito today! They have a tasty new salsa at this location too."}
{"text":"Man ya bombed out on me again... drove three miles.. ordered.. everything on time... drive home... wrong order... I was the only one there. ...and still the order was wrong...I wanted 3 chicken tacos and a number 6.... lol I ended up with two orders of rolled tacos, torta with some type of fried meat, and a carnesada taco... all smothered on guacamole. ...almost right?.... next time ill work on my ordering skills... you didnt loose a customer. ...but damn I was hungry"}
{"text":"Since I work swing shift, this is my go to late night spot. You can get carne asada fries for $9 and I can't even finish it some times. Never been disappointed with the food but sometimes it comes out really good(I like my fries extra crispy so that is always a plus). Night staff is pretty cool, oddly enough when I started open carrying they actually started making conversation. But I avoid this plus during the day. I get a lot of nasty looks even before I was open carrying. I get this a lot in Mexican stores/restaurants, it's like they don't want my white business. It is pretty annoying that they charge for debit/credit card usage. Would be less of hassle since I go to the bank to pull out some cash so I don't have to pay the extra charge. I feel like business should just absorb that fee buts that's just me. All in all, cool place for some late night food."}
{"text":"Had to get down and have my order corrected after sitting a decade in the drive thru. Shrimp cocktail was in a small cup. All other locations use the large cup. I told them this. I go home to find the tiniest shrimp on the planet in my cup. No bigger then a freakin dime. What a rip off!!! 10 dollars for bullshit!"}
{"text":"Food is straight up bad compared to any other Roberto's.   I recommend other ones but this one is not worth anyone's time or money."}
{"text":"Clean store good food but bad service. The crew hardly acknowledges you. Wish they also had some spicier options on menu. Price is decent for area."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy tacos! Great price too, I personally wouldn't recommend the shrimp cocktail because it tasted like ketchup, also don't spend $4 on the guacamole, it's more of a paste and not fresh. I was kinda bummed that they didn't offer shrimp tacos, seems like they would have them since they have the cocktail and and a shrimp burrito.   Over all the food was pretty good and came out fast!"}
{"text":"Love this Roberto's. One of the few ones that still have lengua and chile relleno on their menu, and probably the only one that hasn't given me violent diarrhea. It's almost never too busy, so it's easy and convenient to go in and out for carne asada fries in under 5 minutes."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong and I told them and said I was a liar and refused to help me. It was the worst customer service I have seen in awhile."}
{"text":"I swear to everything that I love that this place makes the perfect carne asada fries. Not sure if I spelled that right but honestly I've been to so many different Robertos and every single one of them is not as good as the fries in this Roberto's. So I go here all the time and I'm just in love."}
{"text":"Severe food poisoning. Need I say more? My husband and I have never been sicker. Stay away!"}
{"text":"What type of Mexican restaurant is this no beans on the burritos or tortas wtf .. And we have to pay extra that shit should be standard on the food .. It's like going to a pizza place and they going to charge you extra for pizza souce hahahah fucken boo boo ass place don't recommend it at all .. Ppssstt have to pay extra for beans fucken stupid ass Mexicans .."}
{"text":"Very rude woman working the counter. So rude asked for my money back..She must be new and doesn't know how to work the register. So she had to go find her boss. and told her boss i was complaining about the price of a side in spanish..... Rememder ladie. Some white people know spanish! You can't just lie to your boss and somebody just sit there and accept you doing that To make yourself look good. And make the customer look bad.... very unprofessional!!!! Very sad to experience that.  Roberto's always has good food."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a quesadilla and a burrito. 45 mins later and other guest getting their food first we asked the lady why it took so long for our food to come out and she just said I'm sorry, the cook I noticed the whole time was just taking his time and when she asked him about our order he just shrugged. I really don't appreciate having our time wasted waiting for an order that wasn't even made. We got our money back and just left. If I didn't think he'd spit in our food I would've asked for our meal to be free but I was just upset and hangry and was over it. Terrible experience. The cashier lady had good customer service, this was all the cooks fault. He literally skipped our order and made everybody else's. So disappointed because I love Roberto's, I never want to go to this location again despite it being down the street from our house. If I could out zero stars I would."}
{"text":"I like Roberto's Tacos in general.  This location was just OK for me.  For some reason, the tacos are not as tasty as the one on Durango.  This location is closer to my house so I'll come again for a fast meal.  If I have time, I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"Las Vegas staple. People are super friendly and food is pure, unadulterated, greasy amazing."}
{"text":"Tacos were expensive and tasted bad.  Mom spent $12 for 4 large tacos which is absurd for a taqueria. I only ate it because we were hungry, it was late and at least it's not greasy spoon fast food.  The food was not the best quality as it did not hold up well by the time my mother brought me the meal, and she was not far away from the UMC where I was.  The tacos were cold, tasteless and the tortillas fell apart too easily when eating.  The vegetables in the taco did not taste like they were not at the peak of freshness even if they were still edible.  A good quality and fresh tortilla should be warm, soft and hold its shape as you eat it.  The red sauce was milquetoast."}
{"text":"The food is very good just like most of the robertos taco shops, but this one was just so packed. It might be because it is 12:30 and a lot of people take lunch at this time. The wait was horrible. I was later compensated for the wait with the delicious food, but I'm never going there on my lunch. I'll go any time I'm not time sensitive."}
{"text":"Standard late night .....berto taco shop.  Good place to kill a craving.  24 hours a day means you're always welcome."}
{"text":"If I could give this Roberto's ZERO stars I would! No matter who they hire to work behind that bullet proof glass the lady is always RUDE! The one girl that works there w the glasses didn't even know my husband and I were together so when I was at the counter she pokes her head out and says \"Yes?\" What do you mean yes, how about \"How can I help you?\" My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and we waited for it for 20 minutes until my husband come back to the car stating the cook forgot to make it. That's when I came in because we had three kids waiting in the car including a baby and I was beyond upset at this point. Long story short she didn't even offer an apology, if we were White or military patrons I bet she would have at least apologized. So I made sure I gave this specific Robertos a bad review, plus they're salsa bar is always dirty and their soda machine serves flat drinks."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a legit Mexican food place and this is it. Reminds me of California taco stands. I got the nachos and torta and it was a reasonable price !"}
{"text":"Really excellent food! I ordered the chicken chimichanga and my husband got beef fajitas with corn tortillas! Both were amazing, i couldn't finish the chimichanga and had some the next day. Great guac and fresh pico!"}
{"text":"Beware!! This location will make your food with stale items. The cooks often add things like tomatoes or onions to items like tostadas that don't come with that. Connie the owner will try to convince you that she doesn't speak English very well and when that doesn't get you to hang up or leave she tells you that for a refund of your money; only with in a 5 hour period of your purchase can get a refund and you must also bring in the items your complaining about and have the receipt. No refunds unless you meet both of those standards. Save yourself the hassle and gastric upset and go to a different store."}
{"text":"We come here almost every week and it's a very busy location. They are friendly, but almost every other time we come there is a waiting issue.... I get the tacos are in demand on Wednesdays lol but Today I waited 26 minutes for 3 tacos \"to go\", and the guys behind me as well as people who were not even at the restaurant when I placed my order were getting their food before my tacos were even made. Accidents happen, but it's just a little annoying when you're on a limited lunch break."}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix and worked the graveyard shift, my only choices for food in the middle of the night were Whataburger and Roberto's.  Now, all these years later, I have a Roberto's close to my house at the Gibson location.  Gourmet food this is not - but for a quick lunch that will fill you up or after a night of cocktails, it's the perfect choice.  The prices are reasonable and oddly enough, I always order the same thing and never deviate.  The food just tastes so good, though sometimes I question the quality of the meat.  There is plenty of seating available, but I usually order take out and eat at home.  This establishment is always clean, including the restrooms, and the staff have always been friendly.  It's a great alternative to the traditional fast food outlets."}
{"text":"The new return policy is stupid. They get the order wrong often, and I say nothing. But this new policy is just stupid."}
{"text":"I love Robertos in general. However - his one serves a MUCH MUCH smaller shrimp burrito than the other location. I've called them about it and they've given me the brush off. They actually told me I was wrong - that all Bertos make everything he same.   It is annoying to have to drive to the one on Lake Mead when the horizon location is 2 minutes from me.   Get it together Bertos."}
{"text":"Roberto's was a good source for fast and decent Mexican and with a 24 hr drive through. After today I will not go back. Tacos used to be fat with everything. Greasy, rancid tasting with very little cheese and lettuce of all things is what I got today. Plenty of others to choose from around town."}
{"text":"tacos are gross super greasy to the extreme at first I thought it was maybe the fresh lettuce  but when grabbed another one it was staining thru the paper . Service was ok but they didn't fix my issue so I'll never eat there agin an wouldn't recommend anyone else to I'm Mexican also an that was garbage maybe everyone should stop laughing an make the food right I would had gave it a 0 had to throw the bag out before grease got on my care it's was staining thru the taco paper an the paper bag shits gross go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Never. Never. NEVER AGAIN! I've had this place on three separate occasions trying my hardest to give it a shot and I've came to conclusion this place is just not it. The past two times I've been this place literally will send you straight to the bathroom. I got the carne asada nachos and my boyfriend got a burrito. My boyfriend literally began to throw up after his third bite and for myself I was in the bathroom for over an hour. Sorry to over share but this place is horrible. Save your money and the trip because it's definitely not with it."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple Roberto's. This one prepares the food the BEST. Like another review said, they make the biggest chicken tacos! They do not skimp, that is for sure! Great cashier too! So, all around 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for quick Mexican food.  The place really gets busy during lunch.  However, the wait isn't long.  The kitchen works fast without sacrificing quality. The sitting area is large and there is plenty of room between tables.  Restrooms have been sparkling clean both times I've used them."}
{"text":"For a late night meal this is definitely a go to spot. I need a quick fix but upon arriving the cashier was on her cell phone and that's never a good look for a business. After she put her phone down she was nice she took my order and I must have waited maybe about 5 or 6 minutes tops before my order was ready. My friends and I ordered chicken quesadillas and rolled taquitos...it was descent food and not good price for the extra guac and sour cream.  I'm huge on cleanliness and they get a B. Don't care if the cashier speaks English or not...i speak both so no issue there."}
{"text":"My daughter was hungry after school last Wednesday and wanted Carne Asada fries so I took her to Roberto's on Nellis and Vegas Valley. The place was very clean, spacious, and there's plenty of seating there if you want dine-in.   In addition to the Carne Asada fries, I ordered two Carne Asada burritos, and four chicken tacos ($1 on Wednesday's). The burritos come with only steak, guacamole, and salsa. To me, they were just OK. The meat didn't have the grilled flavor or much flavor. I also wish they'd add rice or cheese or just something else to the burritos. I will say that they are a decent size, though. Very filling. As for the chicken tacos- the meat was dry and flavorless but they give you plenty of it. And, they're only a $1 on Wednesday's, so I guess I can't complain too much. To add flavor I just added the green sauce that they have in the self serve area.   My daughter loved the Carne fries! We even went back today to get her some. The fries looked amazing! Lots of meat, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and picco. They come with beans too, but she requested they exclude them. You get so much!   I like how they place utensils, straws, and napkins out so that customers can get the amount they need instead of having to ask for it.   As long as my daughter keeps wanting their fries, and service is up to par, then I'll be back. She loves this place."}
{"text":"An an MA student from Brightwood College I am proud to be a customer and friend to thode who work at this location. They are professional dealing with customers and have the recipe down. They show you up and have a window to monitor their work. Rated best of LV in 2007"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location... Friendly people, great food...Best chicken tacos and the pickled carrots are awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat. We decided to stop by Roberto's and try it out. For $27 we got one shrimp and one fish burrito and combo # 17 which is Diablo skimp with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato on the plate with a side of two tortilla. The tortillas were home made and simply delicious. They have a hot sauce, cucumbers and carrot and jalapeños bar. Even though the food was almost $30 it was worth every penny and to be honest we barely finished our food.   Apart from all of the above, the bathroom was out of soap, so bring your own soup ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this Roberto's after a failed visit to the Bermuda and Cactus location. I was craving some Carne Asada Fries, while my boyfriend wanted a shredded-pork burrito with no spicy sauces or beans, but with potatoes and lettuce. He's particularly picky when it comes to Mexican food.  The Bermuda and Cactus location did not allow the substitutions for his burrito so I just ordered my fries. We both had a craving for some Mexican food so I went to this location to get his food.  Considering the late hour we arrived, the woman who helped me order my boyfriends burrito was very patient and willing to complete an order. I simply told her what my boyfriend wanted in a burrito and she helped make that happen by suggesting a specific burrito that was plain enough to add more toppings. My boyfriend was satisfied with the burrito and I enjoyed my fries.  I liked how patient and the cook was even though it was like 3am lol."}
{"text":"The Service he is bad the lady behind the counter is rude an slow an lazy omg it took her for ever to put stuff out an take a order don't come"}
{"text":"How do you mess up tacos? I ordered through the drive thru and messed up the entire order. Wasn't a hard order just no guacamole on them... So they decided just to give us meat and a tortilla. Waste of 20 bucks"}
{"text":"this location is super slow!  food is ok ,but don't think it will be fast.  It is slow,slow,slow!"}
{"text":"As much as I love this place'a good (which is whys gave three stars), they constantly get my order wrong. I order no pico, it comes with pico. I order guacamole, it comes with none. Sometimes I am missing whole items. There is never consistency and I just assume my order will be wrong. The kicker is, they always read my order back to me. Hopefully it gets better, but I suggest going in to ensure you get everything correct."}
{"text":"Onions onions onions. Ordered a lengua burrito and it was filled with onions. Also ordered shredded beef nachos and there was no meat only onions . Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They make the best quesadillas i have ever had! I just wish the place was a little bit more cleaned up, place looks and smells like a run down taco shop...I guess that is what i get for realism..."}
{"text":"Love Roberto's food but apparently the language barrier is to much for these people on swing shift between 5pm and 7pm cuz they always get my order wrong. What's so difficult to understand about lettuce and white cheese only."}
{"text":"I love this Robertos. It's different than others in Henderson. They have three great salsas to choose from on the salsa bar that are all restaurant quality. I love to get their bean burrito and my husband get the California burrito ( which has fries in it) Wednesday they have $1.00 chicken tacos and they have a few other specials daily. Great staff and always clean."}
{"text":"The food is not good has no flavor and it stinks like a sewer when you walk in.if you want to eat and smell a sewer go eat there"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place that I've found in Vegas. I went there last week at 11pm and still got great service. I had the steak burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo and it was stellar! Definitely worth trying once and I'll tell you right now, I'm going back sometime soon."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food I have had in Vegas. Love their burritos and enchiladas. I recommend them for sure. You won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast  burrito Egg was overcooked  Potato was undercooked  Bacon was old  Cheese was not even melted in to the burrito   Horrible horrible  The burrito at Mc Donalds is way better   This particular branch of Robertos is probably one of the worst that I have ever been in to; food and service.   Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Carne Asada chimichanga...very good and tasty!!! The flavor and marinade is good. Lots of food for your$$$$. They have chicken tacos on special for $1.20 each. Quite a great deal if you ask me. The staff is very friendly and professional. Robertos is always awesome for anytime munchies."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience!! When we ordered and didn't get beans or guacamole and added lettuce, they refused to substitute the beans and guacamole for the lettuce and charged us extra for the lettuce. On another order I ordered guacamole, sour cream and extra cheese. They said that they gave me sour cream however, none was present on my carne asada fries. When confronted, they responded as if I was in the wrong for bringing it to their attention. They did did give me a cup of sour cream however, they asked me if I wanted extra. I responded that I didn't want extra, I just want what I'm paying for. The fact is, there was very little guacamole on them as well. Their attitudes were unprofessional an unaccommodating. I will not be visiting this Roberto's again except for speaking to a manager."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is probably the best around town. For some reason the night crew seems to make it taste even better. I usually get the California burrito and fish tacos but it's just not the same during the day nor at other Roberto's. (dried/ lacks flavor) Kudos to the night crew."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this Robertos's mainly because of the best huevos rancheros ANYWHERE! Today I ordered and was told that the owner no longer wants them to sell it! What?!? He got them to make it anyway, but continued to insist the owner doesn't want it on the menu. I'm so disappointed! If it's true, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This location took over the terrible failure that used to be Amigo's Tacos, and I must say, what an improvement! The food is always made fresh when I order it. I usually visit during the 7-9pm time frame, which is a plus that they don't serve you something that's been sitting there all day. Carne Asada Fries are delicious. Reminds me of the Mexican food joints in East Los Angeles. Oh, I almost forgot to mention... these guys do know English, which is always a plus when asking questions with words other than those on the menu."}
{"text":"My first time to this location of Robertos. I've been eating Robertos food since the late 1970's in San Diego. This was the nicest Robertos I've ever been in. Yesenia Mendiola and Juan Escaleva were on duty that night and because of their top quality service and pleasant attitudes this is now My Go To Robertos !"}
{"text":"Wait time just to be greeted at the counter, is ridiculous. Just acknowledge that were here waiting and that you will be with us. Only focus is on the drive thru. Restaurant was empty.  will never return."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and it was ok. I ordered something I normally wouldn't get, but I thought I would be adventurous and got the chile rellenos and cheese enchilada plate. It was ok, not a big fan of their enchilada sauce on everything. But every other time was great"}
{"text":"I love robertos. when it comes to fast Mexican food they do it best. The university location never disappoints except if there's more than a few people in line. It seems to take extraordinarily long to receive your order. But it's always hot and delicious. Staff is polite & helpful"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The food is frozen and warmed to order and there just isn't anything that tastes fresh. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been to many Roberto's and by far this is the best one. The location is very clean, service is fast, profecional employee and the food is great."}
{"text":"I just love (Roberto's Taco shop) it is fast food, that is also very, very good, and tasty Mexican food....the real thing - I've eating at many Mexican Restaurants in the country, and they may have a cozy setting, with nice plates at these other joints, but Roberto's has their Mexican food down to authentic south of the border greatness......I just love their carna asada burritos, when ever I'm in Las Vegas, which is 60 miles from where we live in Pahrump, Nevada.....they are the place we go for our Mexican food fix.......my only complaint, is that they don't have one of there restaurants out here where we live in Pahrump, Nevada.....I'll keep my fingers crossed - I recommend Robert's to everyone who enjoys a great plate of good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I frequent this Roberto's probably about twice a month. Customer service is usually sub par, but food is pretty consistence for the most part, which keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Food was good, but HORRIBLE service. We walked in and nobody was at the counter or even in the kitchen. We waited 5 minutes until this lady came from the back on her phone texting and didn't even say a word until we started our order."}
{"text":"This place sucks, I order carnitas tacos, I get carnitas w/ a side of tortilla..got to the one one Gibson"}
{"text":"Ordered a shredded beef burrito got back to work took one bite of a dripping wet ....soaked burrito I unrolled to see that my burrito was full of onion and bell peppers and this nasty boiled all stingy like corned beef meat ....same way with there chicken burritos this place is worse then taco Bell I would refer someone to del taco before I ate this nasty boiled meat crap again .........never again roberto"}
{"text":"Awesome!!The food here is fresh and refreshing... I had the rolled tacos and they were simply delicious.  The customer service is above and beyond!"}
{"text":"OMG ... NEVER AGAIN  The only reason I give this place one star is because the app will not allow me to give it zero. This is the second time I've tried to eat at Roberto's, the first time I was not served because I did not speak Spanish. I had gone into the location on Eastern on Wednesday and asked if the taco special was available in soft tacos instead of crunchy. I was rudely told no and immediately the young lady started waiting on the person behind me in line because she could converse with them in Spanish.. It was not a busy time, the person behind me was the only other person in the restaurant. Tonight, I came to the location on Gibson. Again, it was a slow time there was only one other person in the restaurant. The place was filthy and several tables needed to be bussed. I was charged a surcharge to use a debit card though it was not posted nor was I told. I went to the restroom to wash my hands while I waited on my order, the restroom was disgusting and there was no soap. I wonder where the cooks wash up. As I mentioned, this was my second attempt, there will not be a third. I did attempt to eat the food, it was mediocre at best. I guess I couldn't get it out of my head that the people working there could not wash their hands."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience! Perhaps if I had ordered something else, it may have been different, but unfortunately, I will not be returning.  It was a late night and I was too lazy to drive to my usual, and reliable spot, Felipito's.  Went through the drive through and waited nearly 15 minutes at the window before I got my food. I ordered a chicken burrito and asked them what it came with. They said chicken, peppers, pico de gallo and sour cream. I asked to add rice and guacamole and they said its an extra charge, so I said \"ok, that's fine.\" Came home to realize they gave me only ONE hot sauce, which is clearly not enough for a burrito. Then, as I'm eating my chicken burrito, I find that all they put inside my burrito was RICE AND CHICKEN...and that's it! Besides having missing ingredients, the chicken was huge chunks of chicken that made it nearly impossible to bite through.  I'll definitely be making the drive over to Felipito's next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"Chile relleno is great here. Good off the strip after-hour joint in Vegas for a quick Mexican craving. Also, the red and green salsa were fresh made and very flavorful."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently a problem, over time...every time. Yesterday, at 4pm, I  ordered 1 burrito. 7 employees at the time, albeit shift change. No sense of urgency and not busy...but soooo slow. It is only at this location. Don't feel as though there is any commitment to customer service."}
{"text":"$2 for sour cream?!?!? Is it made with diamonds? I haven't been to Roberto's in a while but apparently they've rebranded to be the Louis Vuitton of taco shops."}
{"text":"Mess load of Nachos(carne asada) came jam packed with lots of toppings, meat, guacamole,cheese, beans and were a great deal for 7 bux. Carne Asada burrito for 5 bux was simple and tasty, not enormous, but def more than enough food. Don't expect a neat and clean restaraunt, as no one was cleanin tables, but hey its a taco joint so we weren't suprised."}
{"text":"I love Robertos. Been eating at several locations for a long time. I gave this location 3 stars based on service.  I live down and street and order here all the time on my way home from work. And everytime I call I get asked \"Do you know where we're located?\"   I say yes I order here alot. And they still contine to ask me \"ok, where are we?\" I wouldn't be ordering if I didnt know where you were located. Its just annoying to answer that question every time. Otherwise, the place is decent for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Worst Roberto's I have ever been to hands down. Terrible customer service and the place was so dirty !!! I got the carne asada fries and there was literally no fries on there. Called to tell them that and it seemed like they didn't even care. Never going back"}
{"text":"So I ain't really like this location I was already not having a good day and I could have sworn I said Carsada fries not nachos she could have done good customer service and  traded them in but she was being rude and was like sorry u have to take these or buy some more hell naw grr just not my day."}
{"text":"Used to be good but service is bad mess up orders and food isn't tjat good at all get a stomach ache , Quit going!!!"}
{"text":"They're FINALLY open! We couldn't WAIT to get a Roberto's closer to our house. Now we have one. I know other reviewers had a little difficulty with wait times etc, but they're newly opened - give 'em a break!  Awesome food - same as every other location (except Durango and DI - hate that one) and great staff.  ONE SUGGESTION!!! -- Turn down the volume on your drive through speaker. The neighbors (houses behind you) are WAY too close for you to be that loud. If I lived there, your speaker would be missing by now. (kidding) (no I'm not)  Anyway - LOVE the drive through. LOVE the 24 hour service. LOVE Robertos."}
{"text":"Honestly, my family and I eat at Roberto's so often I can't believe that it never occurred to me to write a review until now. We're from Southern California (born and raised) and Roberto's is our go-to place for Mexican food. There is really no other place in Las Vegas that nails it like Roberto's does. It's excellent in every aspect from the quality to the ingredients to the service. This location in particular offers consistency of product and service that should be the model for all of their other locations.  I've eaten at probably every other Roberto's across Las Vegas and I've found every one except the Durango/ D.I. location to be perfect. That location seemed a bit disorganized on my visit and the people weren't of the caliber of the other locations. Not sure why, just my observation.  Whether you want traditional Mexican food on the go or if you want to eat in, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I live less than a 1 minute drive from this place so when my room mates and i want a late night snack we tend to come here because who loves mexican food more than 23 year olds?.. lemme just say, im not even going to put effort into this review, the crew is ALL rude, especially on the late shift, and that pisses me off since I work in Food and Bev as well and am always polite.... the crew here needs to work on their attitudes, they're slow, they're condescending, the food normally doesn't even come out correct and I'll DEFINITELY be going to another place from now on... AND IF I DO COME BACK, AND THIS CREW HAS AN ATTITUDE, IM GONNA REFLECT THEIR SHITTY ATTITUDE SINCE THE 40YR OLD CREW LIKES TO ARGUE LIKE CHILDREN.. :~)"}
{"text":"This location is quite near the Nest, and I've been eating here since before the Orchid Stop/Sinclair station was bought out by Green Valley Grocery/Shell (when the gas prices were cheaper).  So, on with the review.  In the interest of full disclosure, I will state that the Great Bearded Bird is allergic to avocado is all its forms.  I've ordered the carne asada nachos numerous times (specifically ordered WITHOUT guacamole), the shrimp cocktail a few times (also without caterpillar guts in any form), and the flautas/rolled tacos/whatever they call them a couple of times.  Never any complaints.  Super-duper-classy?  No.  Decent food at a decent price?  Definitely.  The condiment bar is a nice touch (I do tend to eat the carrots in escabeche, and the scallions).  And, if you aren't in the mood for a standard fountain soda, you can grab a can or bottle from the gas station convenience store that's in the same building.  I've been back, and unless something quite untoward happens, will continue to do so. -- -- -- -- -- On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 88."}
{"text":"24 hour fresh mexican food with a DRIVE THU...I'm in heaven!!!  Breakfast burittos, carne asada burritos, chimichangas, rolled tacos, & the Horchata are all DELISH!  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, very close to real mexicsn taste; clean and fast. Sometimes instead of a taco I get a enchilada but nobody is perfect."}
{"text":"Craving Roberto's  chicken tacos with a sleeping baby in the backseat so I needed a drive thru and they were amazing! I called ahead and pulled up they had everything I needed and all the extras too with a smile! And didn't have to disturb the sleeping baby.  Hot Fresh Fast and oh so convenient! My only regret is I should have left a bigger tip. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just left this robertos and was completely dissatisfied with the service and the food . The food had no flavor whatsoever and the prices ridiculous. To make matters worse, the cashier , some girl with badly over drawn eyebrows and braces had the nerve to start talking about my guts and i saying we're \" too \" poor to afford the food . Definitely will not be coming here ."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is horrible. The lady behind the counter is a rude who must hate her life. Very bad customer service skills this can ruin their reputation. I would rather do business where they appreciate you."}
{"text":"They should call it awesome Wednesday. Best deal in town for hard tacos. And the salsas are great w all the condiments."}
{"text":"I got the nachos with carne asada. There was nothing to them. No beans, rice, salsa etc and they were gross"}
{"text":"this place is always yummy! i havent had an issue yet! the service is pretty good, and the food is always amazing! they have daily specials so your never spending too much money :)"}
{"text":"Pull up to the drive thru to order and the employee thought I was someone else. He had me pull up to the window and asked me what's up. I told him I was trying to place an order and he was so confused, so he started asking me about someone else, but at no time corrected himself or dropped it to take my order. I was beyond frustrated and left. Drive thru needs to get it together!"}
{"text":"I sort of didn't like how the tables were dirty, and the food was alright.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"This place is ok, I will change the salsas though,  the red salsa has a weird taste, but it's not just this Roberstos it's all the Robertos I've been to."}
{"text":"Out of all the other Roberto's shops in the area, this is my favorite one. You haven't tried nachos until you've tried roberto's Carne asada nacho (get it Togo, you get more out of it ;) other than that, they have beef & chicken tacos which are deep-fried and stuff with almost all the condiments that Mexican sides provide. Also, the chimichangas meets all needs for a hungry customer."}
{"text":"I normally like Robertos taco shop,but this location seems not to care about the quality of food it puts out.  I ordered a cheese enchilada and the cheese was not melted and cold!"}
{"text":"The food quality is good and the prices are fair. I have been here four times and my order was wrong twice. I really wish you could order mixed burritos without onions."}
{"text":"I've been eating Mexican food for 15 years and I just ate the thinnest burrito I've ever had in my life.  To add to the insult, what little girth it had was due to massive amounts of lettuce--it was about 80% lettuce and 20% fish.  When I was done, I felt like I didn't even eat at all.  Not to mention that at one point it had a weird bitter taste, enough to spit out what I was chewing--maybe I just munched on a cockroach.  This place has gone way downhill since that Mexican-version-of-Super-Mario looking dude stopped overseeing the place.  Along with my previous experiences with this place, this just sealed the deal--I am never going back here again.  I highly recommend seeking an alternative."}
{"text":"You misspelled patronage at your drive thru window, you forgot the R. You also shouldn't hover over your customers while they are writing how much they are going to tip you. You should feel blessed you work at a place where the customers are allowed to tip with a credit card because they don't where I work."}
{"text":"Worst fucking place ever ! I ordered the tacos de lengua, they tasted dry as hell, the horchata wasn't even sweet and on top of all that, I got food poisoning for 4 days straight after eating there, never going there ever again !"}
{"text":"Alway a half hour wait. Even when no one is in drive thru. And the girl who usually works the window is rude."}
{"text":"My co-worker just got back to the office with some Carne Asade Nachos that were SUPER SKIMPY! Smallest portion of Nachos ever...poor guy is HANGRY (hungry + angry). SAD FACE for Bermuda Robertos!"}
{"text":"I went last night. I wanted to order two items. One California burrito and one carne Asada fry with a side of shrimp. First no one spoke any English. And couldn't understand what I wanted. Both my items together should have cost no more then 15$. When she tried to charge me closer to 30$, I was confused bc and also added on their that I wanted a shrimp burrito. When I said no I didn't, she couldn't understand what I was saying. Then the phone rang, and she left me, and took the phone order, gave it to the cook, then did something else, then came back to me. And she kept trying to charge me for things I didn't want. And the cook was of no help either. So I left without ordering anything while I had to wait for her for like 20 mins.  Worst ROBERTO'S ever."}
{"text":"I used to like Roberto's. I hadn't been there in a while but decided to stop by recently. The food quality has changed since the last time I was there. The meat was dry and nothing was flavored the way it was before. Also, they don't give you as much. I just don't think I'll be going back. However, the service is always nice, and they do greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"Normally I like robertos. But man is it hard to get a simple bean and rice burrito with extra rice without having to go back several times because they don't want want to give you the extra rice you PAID EXTRA FOR!!!!!! This has happened on multiple occasions, and each time I practically BEG them to make sure they put extra rice. But somehow I end up with fat bean burrito with a few grains of rice...  I love rice, so yes this hits me harder than it should..  So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the staff friendly service for the midnight crew. They always know my order and grill the green onions from the condiment bar I bring to them. However if you are a vegetarian please make it clear that you don't want meat, couple of my friends order breakfast burritos with no meat and sometimes they still put the meat in there. No mess ups for my orders though!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Roberto's, never had a problem at any location.. until I got food poisoning from this one. Pin pointed that it was the pickled carrots at their little salsa bar, I was down the whole Christmas weekend. Never again! Beware of this location!!!"}
{"text":"I like Roberto's for fast Mexican food, the food is really great everytime. The fresh vegetable and hot mix bar is always maintained. Too many favorite choices to list everything. Try carne asada fries for something different. Rolled taquitos, chile rellenos, tostadas all excellent."}
{"text":"Don't know why they have such low reviews ,but so far is the best Roberto's taco shop , I order my favorite carne asada fries and let me tell you ! The  meat was well cooked not chewy ( I hate meat that is chewy and is mostly fat than meat )but you could see the lady cook , making it fresh , everything we order was good and delicious ! And the place was really clean ( even the restrooms ) that's a plus ! Too bad is too far from where I live but definitely when I'm on that area , I will stop by . Oh and the salsas where fresh and so good , next time I'll take pictures"}
{"text":"This place is so discussing I dont know how they hired this kind of people to work in this place I went to buy food therelike around 10pm and the service is so bad with this people the cashier was sitting in the back when I got there I couldn't hear what he said after he took my orden he went to sit in the back again a customer came in and he got up my food and some other people's food was on the counter already the service is really bad with this guy is not the first time I go there and is the same with him"}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop is one of my favorite stops for a good breakfast burrito!  Since it is on the way to work I usually hit this joint in the morning so I've always and only gotten their breakfast burrito with bacon.  The burritos are huge and pack great flavor and a low price of $5."}
{"text":"Some days are a hit and miss I go here because it's right next door to my house but iv had straight bath room issues after eating here on 2 occasions . The staff is friendly and it's convenient just make sure you don't have plans after words"}
{"text":"Disagree with previous reviewer.  Robertos's is as good and solid chain/over-the-counter Mexican food restaurant as you're likely to find in town.  It's fresh, they prepare the food with real ingredients after you order it, it's open 24 hours, what's not to like?  This particular location seemed cleaner and nicer than a few others I've been in around town.    If you're a carnivore, I highly recommend the Carne Asada burrito.. great flavor, and not at all lacking anything in terms of how much steak you get!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure which location I went to, so I'll just review this one..  I don't know what it is about this place, but their food.. I don't even know how to explain it.. it's so GOOD.  Especially open 24 hours, going in at 2 in the morning, never tasted better for a midnight snack.  Definately the best of the best.  I wish there was one in the bay area. :-("}
{"text":"The restaurant menu price listed was different than the price that an item rings up... and not only that but there is nothing like \"running out\" of free water cups so your customers have to pay $1.70 for ice water and refusing to give the largest cup or refund the price difference... I can't ! And then making me wait for you to service all the the customers in line before you can give me a refund #smh"}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest Roberto's in Las Vegas! I've been to a whole lot and I would drive clear across town just to come to this one, it's always clean..the food taste amazing, like....the food is the same but this place taste more fresh, if that makes sense lol! When I moved her and I found out about this place, I come at least 2 times a week!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! I feel like throwing up. I am NEVER eating at any Roberto's Taco Shop again. My husband ordered me a carne asada nacho about half an hour ago (to-go)....ate it and on the bottom I found a fried \"tie knot closure\" that belongs on a plastic packing bag. Are you kidding me? I will be contacting the Clark County Health District. How unsanitary is that place or their workers? If I could I would leave no stars.  It doesn't matter if you're busy and it's chicken taco Wednesday. This should never be in anyone's food. Date: 1/6/2016 @ 9:44 pm."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've always loved this place. I usually order the rolled tacos (chicken) and get a side of rice and beans. Their salsa bar (complete with lots of extra veggies) is delish. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Carne asada meat was dog food quality--simultaneously fatty and tough.  The woman who took my order had trouble communicating in English.  And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo."}
{"text":"Ordered a California burrito, cheese wasn't even melted, opened up to see only a few French fries minimal carne asada."}
{"text":"$4 TACOS really no flavor...too much hot sauce cause the meat has no seasoning...the are rude ass head."}
{"text":"We stopped at this little spot after leaving Vegas and finding it here on Yelp!   It was very clean, had a lot of options. Food was good, but definitely seemed overpriced for standard Mexican food. For 3 people to eat it was almost $50. Maybe pricing has to do with location, but where I'm from you go for the Mexican food because you can get a lot for cheap!"}
{"text":"I live in LA, but I go to Vegas every January and July for a couple weeks to visit my folks. This Roberto's is always my first stop, regardless if I am hungry or not, regardless if I don't feel like eating mexican food, and regardless of what time it is.  I usually get the two beef tacos combo, but I've had a lot of other items on their menu.  I love their bacon breakfast burritos.  It's not the best I've had, but it's pretty good. Overall, their food never disappoints.  It is always made fresh and the price of their food is reasonably priced.  The only complaint I have, and the only reason why I gave it a 4 star and not a 5, is because of their red salsa.  It used to be my favorite one, but when I came to visit in July of 2015, I noticed that their red salsa tasted very bland and it has some kind of \"plastic\" taste to it.  I thought, \"Okay, maybe they just made a bad batch...\" But as I came back in January and July of 2016 and 2017, I've noticed that it still has that same taste...it's not as good as it once was.  I don't know if they changed the recipe or what, but I stick to the salsa verde from now on..."}
{"text":"I been going to this Roberto since it opened. The quality and size keeps getting worse. It's right by my house. I actually drive to another one further away to get better and more Mexican food. New fan of Donny Tortas now"}
{"text":"Just had their good ole carne adada burrito and the meat had no flavor. I ve been eating at robertos for about 20yrs and know what to expect. They need to figure out what there problem is and fix it quickly.  Service was great though."}
{"text":"very good meat..ya just have to go there at the right times..:) ...the last 4 times i was there the meat was excellent and at perfect temperature as well....i usually go for the carne asada plate which is great...you can literally build yer own burrito...the only minus is that when you get the plate they dont give ya the cheese for it...no biggie...i have all my cheeses at home just ready for it...still it would be nice if they gave ya the cheese on the side at least....other than that i would give it a 5 but the price range is a tad high for the little ingredients....good place though"}
{"text":"Like most Robertos this place was very dirty, and they tried to rip me off $10 in change. The food is quick and reasonable, which is why it gets two whole stars. But the food is half rate and its not an amazing atmosphere. Let's just say you should wait until your drunk to visit this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to place for comfort food.  Love their carna asada fries.  Then I always add some carrots & onions.  Sadly their customer service is up & down.  You don't get the same quality every time."}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos! The chips and salsa were delicious. I ordered two carne asada and one carnitas taco. The arrived with cilantro and lime. They had great flavor! I will eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Rarely clean, mediocre service, mediocre food. Some items such as chile rellenos frequently unavailable."}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter is hella RUDE!!! She made a mistake on my order  and when I went to tell her about it she blamed it on me! Lol.. Smh.. She needs to get fired!! Not my fault she hates her job making minimum wage!!!"}
{"text":"Quick taco joint.  Food is on point, as are the prices.  Carnitas taco was my favorite, which was $2.75 - can't beat that."}
{"text":"I needed 7 carne asada burritos for my workers and these guys were close by. Service was good, Staff was friendly and everyone was happy with their burritos! More authentic and a nice change from Chipotle."}
{"text":"Omg!! the best tacos in Vegas baby! so much cheese and meat wow ..these tacos are a most have!!"}
{"text":"So every Wednesday we pretty much go for their chicken tacos (99 cent tacos). Amazingly great! Giving 4 stars because of  the new guy at the front counter that was kind of rude. I hope he is just filling in for the other guy that used to work Wednesdays. Ive been to this location about 50 times and the customer service has always been great.  I hope this isnt the new change."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night was my first and last time that I will eat in this location, I went there in the evening 8pm, the cashier was so RUDE, I order food to GO and food to eat there, the cashier was rude when she was taking my order, I had order a menudo to go as well as 2 tacos, and 2 tacos to eat there, she took forever to give me the 2 tacos to eat there, as I went to ask about my 2 tacos to eat there, she was giving me the 2 tacos along with the menudo (I was hungry but not the hungry to eat all the food at once f*) I told her that I only wanted the 2 tacos to eat there n the menudo was to go, she roll her eyes I knew she got bother, but I had made it clear when I order the food... she also got bother when I ask for the tacos to be wrap on foil, she made it clear that tacos came in a box, but I did ask nicely to wrap them... the menudo was not good at all, it was not fresh it tasted like it's been there for days....menudo should be made daily!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is now called Don Tortaco Mexican Grill.  I stopped in to see what was different, and the answer is....nothing.  From what I understand it is exactly the same as Roberto's.  The menu and even the employees have not changed.   It is still the same owners, just branding some of their locations differently.    This location is nice and very clean as always.   The prices did go up a little, but not much.  It is still the same great place that I like to stop at a couple of times a month for shredded beef tacos."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. My order was incorrect, I called and was told just come back another day and we'll remake your order, I did just that they said that they don't have my complaint on file. So they would NOT HONOR there commitment. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went in after reading some reviews on here, here on vacation and felt like some good Mexican good.   Customer service was bad and the food was not good , I got the carnitas burrito and rolled tacos.  Food was cold and carnitas didn't taste good.  The lady at the register was rude.  Never coming here again even for free food"}
{"text":"they got my other wrong and I was missing some of my food the man at the window is super rude and unprofessional and he is cursing you out in Spanish! I'm never coming here agin there Service is horrible they can't get any others correct the floors are dirty the people are horrible at there job. Any one that come here check your others food make sure they give you everything also there food suck all the other Roberto's taco shop are good but this one is plan dose not taste like anything         !DONT COME HERE PLEASE!"}
{"text":"This place is always fresh, friendly, and unbelievably fast!  Sometimes I get my order before I'm finished at the salsa bar.  Carne asada is great!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and ordered the carne asada nachos.   The Pros:  Nice customer service. It appeared cleaned inside. I got a lot of meat.    Cons: Bland meat. Luke warm meat Meat tasted as if it was cooked a few days ago then frozen only to be cooked again to sit in lukewarm water till ordered!  More meat then chips, sour cream and pico de gayo. It's not nachos if there are only 10 chips and a 2 pound of meat!!!!  I wanted to give Roberto's a try again but disappointment is what I keep getting from this place. Regardless of the location."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. I like the variety but it was nothing out of the park. A pretty messed up part of town, but I would go again."}
{"text":"My poor postmate came to this location around midnite on July 4, 2017. The staff jg at robertos messed up the order, postmates delivers messed up order, postmates returns to robertos to retrieve missing half of my order and the staffing at robertos refused to make/fulfill the remainder of my order. My postmate was kind enough to pay for the missing portion of my order. I spent $30 to order $12 worth of food from robertos and this location refused to fulfill the missing portion. Customer, always right. Fix it. I won't be sending postmates to this location anymore, nor visiting this location anymore."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is always friendly BUT HOLY SMOKES their green sauce is TOO Spicy. 4/5 stars because of green sauce. Twice I've been here and the 'mild' sauce is just too hot for me."}
{"text":"The food quality & customer service has been pretty poor at this location. I was surprised at how items such as a simple taco or a burrito missed the mark.  The staff at the North Las Vegas location tend to be a tad rude at times (Especially this 30 something mexican woman, whose attitude stinks!). She rolls her eyes when I order food & seems very disinterested in the job. One of the cooks also seems easily irritated when customers have simple requests (such as not adding guacamole to the tacos, etc).   I visited this place with my friend after a night out in Vegas, and altho the food hit the spot...the customer service left much to be desired.   Would I recommend this place? Not really...I'd head to \"Don Tortaco\" off Craig & Camino Al Norte if I wanted a friendlier place with consistently better food quality. The staff there are nicer and greet you in a very natural way...especially if you are a familiar face :)  2 out of 5 stars for Roberto's Taco Shop. I docked 3 stars for the poor customer service, attitude and inconsistant food quality....things that easily take away from a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Love their prices, and the chicken tostada is amazing. They will separate rate all of the ingredients for to go orders upon request. Pretty awesome when ordering nachos to not get home with soggy nachos."}
{"text":"No jalapeños ?? Really?? Watch out for this particular location ,, never stocked lazy employees"}
{"text":"I came to this location because the one on Elkhorn/GMP was having computer troubles. I gotta say I do like that this location looks like an actual restaurant and not a garage in a gas station. What did get to me was I was waiting there for three min while the people in the back stood there. The second thing that bothered me is the    $.50 charge to use your card. This is straight up taking people's money for no other reason than to make more money and screw your customers.  Robertos! It's 2016! Everyone pays with some type of card! Stop scamming your customers out of money!  I personally will never go back to this location due to that fact. I hope that less and less people do and say something about it until they change their archaic ways of doing business.  I will say though, that the food was delicious as expected."}
{"text":"By far the best Roberto's in town! Why you ask, because they actually stock limes in there salad bar! Most Roberto's in town only have lemons, there is nothing better then tacos with lime! Also if you really love lime like I do don't forget to put a squeeze in your Dr. Pepper makes it amazing."}
{"text":"Great Roberto's, always good food and never had them get an order wrong. Live right up the street so it's quick and convenient. The only thing I do not like about this location is they are NOT 24 Hours. Which really sucks when your craving some late night Mexican food."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee Roberto's.  Pros: CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. Very large portions. Much closer to authentic than Taco Bell. Doesn't make for an upset bathroom like Taco Bell.  Cons: They never season beef or chicken good enough. Unless we're talking tacos or burritos, sour cream is pretty much included on everything. A bit too greasy sometimes.  Roberto's is some of the best Mexican food in all of Vegas. It's quite surprising that there's almost 50 locations of it all over town with how consistently good it is. I just wish they did a better job of seasoning meat so I don't have to pour a 1/2 cup of hot sauce or cheese over a burrito for flavor."}
{"text":"its 2am. i order over the phone. 2 tacos carne asada and 1 carne asada fries. chick at the register tried to charge me $21 for 4 tacos and carne asada fries. my food had only 2 tacos.  FU. trying to take advantage of drunks."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego and enjoy Roberto's, having grown up on the food.  Usually, they are good, but after a particularly bad day, I just wanted to get my food and go home.  I ordered Carne Asada chips but got Carne Asada fries. When asked about it, I was ignored, then he read the receipt which said fries.  I explained that I didn't care what the receipts said, I ordered chips. He then turned to the next person in line and started taking their order!  I paid $9 for something that I will not eat.  Do not go to this location as this is the 2nd time in a row that the order has been wrong or I have been overcharged!"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries were ok.  hook it up a little bit more.  more cheese, guacamole, sour crème, tomatoes, and onions.  just got to hook it up!"}
{"text":"They actually charge 1.29 for taco Wednesday which is usually 1.00 and they hardly put any meat save your money go to taco bell you actually get more meat and they are not fried so hard you can break your teeth. Pure fried shells with less than a teaspoon of chopped chicken meat not shredded!"}
{"text":"Walked into my local Roberto's on rainbow and Charleston a employee with tattoos on his hands and arms called me white boy Americano and gringo then asked me where I'm from don't ever go in there  food is great but people are two races to work there"}
{"text":"Beef & Pork burritos are the best. This Team is always on point, when I order. I have been coming here for months. Try to make them laugh and you will get what you really want ( be nice = good karma) speak a little Spanish?  I have been to Cali many times over the past months and this place is much better and closer...  Approved by JKKUHL"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Roberto's! I come at least once a week and the food and service is consistent.  My favorite is the Chimichanga Plate. Always fresh.   Mirta is the BEST. Outstanding customer service! I recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Well, we always dreamed of having our very own Robertos...and it's here!  The place is lovely, bright, great decor with the 2 story ceiling.    Now, for the food...excellent, we love 99 cent Wednesday...and these guys cook the taco shells perfectly, we request them to be a bit softer and its always perfect, fresh ingredients...the breakfast burittos are the bomb on a cold winter morning...melty cheesy eggs, onions and peppers wrapped in a soft, giant flour tortilla...I think I'll go over this morning...  Also, love the carnitas plate...always a generous portion along with the great beans and rice...as good as spending a fortune at Via Mercados, (A place that used to be very good, but now just a step up from Taco Bell, and it's never under $80. For our family of 3 (no liquor either!!)  You cannot go wrong here.  Be happy to have this gem so close now!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the service is embarrassing- no smiles, hellos, thank yous. And I always see the same guy at the register; so once, I made the mistake of attempting the smallest bit of conversation with him- nothing. Looked at me like I had 5 heads. I'm also pretty tired of getting ripped off on the portions and ingredient ratios. Done with this location."}
{"text":"Best in Boulder.  Next to the bong shop so the clientele reflect a hipper crowd than this boomer's but the food is so good and cheap"}
{"text":"Just ordered food here and by far the WORST SERVICE EVER!!! The lady that took my order never gave me my total after I ordered she just told me \"ok\" so I sat there waiting! This Robertos sucks!! When I got to the window she had a attitude and STILL never gave me my total so I asked her AGAIN before I handed her my card! This lady that was handling things at the register at 10:15pm on 12/7/2017 needs to be FIRED !!!!! I'm definitely telling ALL my friends to NEVER go to this Robertos location !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is satisfactory. It's not going to blow your mind. I generally order the California burrito and it's good. But if your looking for something authentic look elsewhere. However, it does the job if your looking for something cheap and filling."}
{"text":"Wow, ordered a burrito and asked for a cup of water.  Response:  sorry, no cup for water.  Can I get my tip back?  Too many other places for my biz.  Go to El Pollo Loco next door.  Added one to the one star cuz the burrito was ok, needs sauce though."}
{"text":"Ive had experiences at different locations that vary greatly This store, closest to where i live, let me down tonight  I love Wednesday Chicken Tacos but the customer service, or I should point out, LACK of customer service is reason for less than good rating  The whole point of being in the restaurant business is to satisfy the customer   Tonight, after ordering, one of our items was made INCORRECTLY . So I take it to the counter and what does the cashier say?? \"You ordered it wrong, next time you'll know better...\" Seriously?? And these are the people that want $15/hr??? Sadly, a statement of whats wrong with this entitlement society  At least Taco Bell will remake the item. Guess you lose another customer, Roberto"}
{"text":"Who sells a burrito with only meat? The water down guacamole does not makeup for no rice or beans. The staff also has horrible customer service. If your craving Mexican food please stay away from this shack!"}
{"text":"The night crew seemed to be playing and cracking jokes as soon as I walked in. I'm black the joke was definitely on me. Lol. I could care less about the jokes I just hope my food ain't sabotaged. SMH"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive Mexican food. I love their Chimichanga combo. Their portions are ample and I usually always have extra food. I also love their breakfast burritos and their tortas.  Update: 11/21/15   I am dropping my rating because you claim your business is 24 hours. I went to get a breakfast burrito before going to work this morning thinking you're 24 hours and you should have food available. I arrived at the drive through only to be told it would be 35 to 40 minutes before breakfast burritos would be available. I left disappointed. I went to another fast food place to get something to eat for breakfast. Please don't claim you are 24 hours if you don't have food available 24 hours."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since 2010. The staff is nice and the food is great. We have been to a few Robertos in Henderson and the food here is one of the better ones. There have been a couple times our take out order was off but it's like 1 out of 50 times.  I do like the tacos here (beef, carnitas or carne asada) they are like the tacos I used to get living in SoCal. I'm not too fond of their fish tacos though.  This location is clean, with friendly staff and they get the food to you quickly."}
{"text":"I normally love Roberto's nachos, but I only eat them plain (what I mean is, no meat). I've noticed some discrepancies with what different chains charge me, and finally realized that they sometimes charge me for an order of beef nachos, and sometimes for an order of asada nachos (the beef/chicken is about 7 dollars and asada is over 8 dollars). I finally tried to order beef nachos, no beef... well at first they couldn't understand me and thought I was saying \"no beans\" which is understandable. I corrected them and said \"no meat\" and then they understood. I pull up to the window (drive thru order) they still tried charging me almost 9 dollars (the asada price). When I asked them to please charge me the lesser price since I'm not even getting any meat (they repeated my order as Veggie Nachos) the guy said that that's what the manager told him to charge. So... not only am I not getting meat, but I'm being charged for the more expensive meat?! I said no thank you and left. I no longer want to pay almost $9 for plain nachos! I emailed corporate and they told me to order the beef nachos no beef to be charged the lesser price..."}
{"text":"Most likely the worst Mexican food in the city.  I had a few tacos there and they were over cooked and tasted like a wet Sunday paper.   Giving the the benefit of the doubt, I went back and tried it again.  The rolled tacos were the worst I've ever had, not even my dog wanted to eat it.  Do not eat here, you'll be sorry."}
{"text":"Got new owners and in my opinion the food and service has gone down. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way. The verde sauce now has a strange flavor to it. And my son's  cheese quesadilla was cooked to long the cheese was hard."}
{"text":"i swear they use dog and cat meat for their burritos tacos and everything else!!! do not eat at these places they need to getinvestigated???"}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. I usually get the carne asada torta because in my opinion, it's one of the best Mexican sandwiches in town. The guacamole spread they put onto the sandwich brings a little heat, and makes the sandwich taste better.  This Roberto's location is nice and modern. Furthermore, this Roberto's location has a friendly staff and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"This place really don't deserve 1 star, 4 the simple reason I ordered a chicken burrito with rice & beans. & I pacifically asked 4 no peppers & onions. I explained when ordering ice been 2 your other locations & had it without. Let alone it seamed that the chicken was missing. So if u happen 2 order from their other locations take key & notice the difference on your item compared 2 their.  I took 3 bites & gave it 2 my dogs........"}
{"text":"I don't want to give this location any stars but since I'm forced to I give it 1 bcuz the food is just thrown together and not cooked thoroughly. I ordered cheese enchiladas and when i got back to my desk to eat my lunch the cheese inside is not even melted and it's still cold. I feel like I'm eating handfuls of shredded cheese and the rice is cold. I will not eat at this location again"}
{"text":"Been going to Roberto's on Wednesdays for their 99 cent tacos for many years. Today was no different only to find out that this particular location charges $1.29 per taco. Kind of disappointed she probably won't be going back again.  In looking online, they're still advertising these tacos for .99.  Not sure if it's only this location but I'm not driving around to different locations to find out.  Bye bye Roberto's. I'll take me business elsewhere where I KNOW what the price is!"}
{"text":"There is something about this Roberto that I like more than the others. I think its the service. The guys working drive thru are always friendly and they ALWAYS hook it up. I feel that take the time to cook my food cause its always delish! The menudos on Sundays are always good. The breakfast burritos are always huge and GREATTTT! The carne asada tortas are always made to perfection. PLUS if yo are out late and want to make a quick run so that you are not hungover the next day (PS hopefully you have a taxi or designated driver) this place is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Great customer service however as I was ordering I noticed the oil in the fryer and it was almost black. I was going to order a taco salad but when I saw the tostado bowl for another order come out of the oil I lost my appetite. I ended up ordering tacos for the family and they were good. I would hope they would change their oil more often being they are opened 24/7."}
{"text":"First thing she told me when I asked if I can use the bathroom. Are you a paying customer? Super rude. Of course I am going to order food. I order three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese and a shrimp burrito. Took 20 mins to make my food that was so nasty we threw away. Rolled tacos had a pound of just cheese and no guacamole, which I payed extra for. The shrimp burrito was so spicy we couldn't eat, I would say it was more of a rice and onion burrito. I understand you raised your prices! So raise your food quality and service!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Roberto's . seemed slow and they made my oder to go like they didnt want any dine ins"}
{"text":"Horrible Mexican food.I'm from California and we have decent to pretty good Mexican food.This was a complete disappointment,now wonder they are open 24/7...definitely a last resort option."}
{"text":"Slow drive thru (waited a good 15-20 minutes), and they overcharged me and made some errors to my order. Food is pretty good, but caused us all some stomach discomfort. May give another try. Right by my house, and 24 hours which is awesome. It's a new location, so hopefully they get better with time."}
{"text":"If I could give any less I would. Let's start with walking/driving up. Nice area next to gas station figure they'd be doing pretty good. Place is tagged up. Owners need to take some time and clean the place up. Anyways you walk in read menu order, to me prices always seem to vary depending on the person behind the register. You take a seat wait for the food to be made. You notice the guy behind there counter no hair net btw, going from prepping meat, veggies, all that good stuff to making your food. Food comes out mediocre. I'm pretty sure the guy outside the stratosphere has better cooking skills. Chicken is warm/cold, tortilla stale, cheese half melted and guacamole lets just say not so green. You're afraid to ask them to remake cuz let's be honest we don't want our food messed with or worse than it already is. I just took the hit heated it up when I took it home. Drive through lets just say the standards so low anything can beat it. Won't waste my time. If you drunk & looking for anything to help you throw up you've found the place!!!!"}
{"text":"No adobada nachos aka (pastor) for tonight. Really! No good. The food went Down hill since the company split. Water down salsas to not so good marinated meats.For once Yolanda the cashier was exceptional. She let me try carnitas before I bought them, witch I din't like. The asada nachos were ok, but you can't always have everything in life. Right !!!!"}
{"text":"The shredded beef nachos are sooo good! I will definitely keep coming back to try their other food."}
{"text":"Honestly I used to love eating at their place but since the food I gotten was served with cold beans and stale rice my opinion of this company completely changed.. As much as I love Mexican food I cannot have canned beans and yesterday's rice.. I will no longer come to Robertos.. To top it off they charge you for a little container of sour cream.."}
{"text":"It is hard to miss a Roberto's anymore; they are all over town. I don't think it tops my 5 favorite places for Mexican food but at least they don't disappoint. their portions are decent and food pretty consistent. 4 star is a little too much and 3 would be a bit low so I am pushing the grade up. Their Chimichangas are still my favorite among their humongous menu, but what is always missing is the Flautas which is hard to find in most Mexican restaurants and fast food places; I will just keep my fingers crossed..."}
{"text":"I typically order a breakfast burrito from here in the morning on the way to work and will call ahead and they usually have it all ready to go when I get there. They are on top of it and keep the store clean."}
{"text":"Great food, as usual for Roberto's. Good portions and they're usually good about getting the food out within 10-15 mins. This location is nice and the restaurant is well maintained and clean. The one main issue I have here is that the hours they are open are inconsistent and I have had a hard time getting someone to answer the phone and many times no one will answer at all and it goes to what sounds like a land line message machine. This is frustrating when I am craving food from here but can't get it and have to drive there to even see if they are open, which several times they have not been and it was still early like 7:30 or 8 pm and they were locked and closing everything down. Irritating when there are very limited choices in the area for eating out."}
{"text":"Went their for dinner last night.  To make this short...I returned all the food 20 minutes later.  It was completely inedible.  I would not let my dogs eat it for fear they would get sick.  My husband and I love Roberto's but we will never eat at this location again.  The customer service is awful and the restaurant looks dirty.   Save yourself from having a bad meal and just go to the one on Cactus...I have never had a bad meal there and the customer service is always great!"}
{"text":"Just left the drive through. After not being greeted at the speaker, driving through the drive thru again, having the guy take our order AFTER he saw us drive through the first time and then he doesn't approached us at the window after waiting 5 minutes- this places sucks. Go to a different Roberto's if you are craving it late night. We didn't get any food. Left hungry."}
{"text":"The people are nice but the Chicken on my tacos didn't really taste like much was kind of blah.  It could have used more seasoning to it"}
{"text":"This new guys that work there there just bad, the guy in the kitchen does nothing but stares at you the whole time you are ordering , the don't smile they don't greed you, seems like they just want you out asap . And apparently they are lazy too judging  for the half ass peel 1inch cucumber,  a 5 year old can do better than that,"}
{"text":"24 hrs drive thru.Taco shell was crispy and tasty, but chicken inside wasn't. Although the chicken was tender.  Tamale was a la carte, with enchilada sauce and cheese, no husk, served in a long Styrofoam container, placed in the bag and given through the window sideways so the sauce basically coated the whole bottom of the paper bag. the mais of it was good, and so was the sauce, but the meat inside was only a very small amount. you get what you paid for.  The guy at the window was polite and was easy to talk to."}
{"text":"It's a nice beautiful Saturday here in Vegas and I'm off so I love to get my day started early. Decided to stop in and get me a carne asada breakfast burrito and guess what??? These fools are deep cleaning the grill so they're turning many of us away!!! It's 6:45 am on a Saturday and you decide to do this now?   This is utterly ridiculous!!! Why wouldn't you do that at 3 or 4 am when there may not be as many customers? People like me think breakfast important and I couldn't get any cuz your staff decided at a peak time to deep clean the grill?  Get it together Roberto's. This is probably the 3rc time this has happened to me. Y'all really need to change that cleaning schedule!"}
{"text":"i am a california native where good mexican food comes from so i decided to go try this place out.  well when i walked in the door i had to wait 5 minutes until somebody came out to greet me and take my order.  but the cashier was very nice and helpful when she finally did come out.  it's too hot here in vegas and i didn't want to cook.  they have alot to offer on their menu so i decided to try the nachos and a burrito for work tomorrow.  the nachos were plenty and probably could eat on them 3 times.  lot of chicken, bean, and all the other fixings.   the shredded beef burrito was okay as i had better.  everything was made to order so i waited another 10 minutes but that was fine.  i probably will try this place again and see what their tacos taste like.  being from california my tongue palate knows what good authentic mexican food should taste like."}
{"text":"Very good food. Not the greatest, but for the price, speed, and hours it's one of the best in my book."}
{"text":"Delish carne asada burritos! Came here for a quick lunch and was blown away by the flavor. If they had one of these places where I live, I'd be fat in no time."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, just like all Robertos are."}
{"text":"As a recent mover to LV very happy Robertos is here too, just like San Diego. Breakfast burrito was great as expected. A little pricier than San Diego, but same good food!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted,  you can see the fresh flour tortillas that by the way are huge! I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito and California burrito with no Pico de gallo, paid $11.30. The California burrito comes with steak and french fries, it was so delicious.  It was my first time there and I will be coming back for more. Service was great,  good was made fast and salsa was tasty."}
{"text":"It's Roberto's what can I say! You've been to one you've been to them all!! I tried something different this time & it was yummy! Though my food was cold & I had to send it back. I'm not a big Pepsi fan, wish they served Coke products. It seemed to be a steady place for a Saturday night. It's located right next to a bar called Cheers & they let you bring food inside to eat."}
{"text":"I have gone here today 5-2-2017@ 1700 the cashier no. 007475 reg 01 emp 1 she was the rudest employee no matter are maybe she doesn't like interracial couples. She looked at us didn't say good evening how may I help you are anything. I know most spanishing speaking employees speak English. But this lady slammed my FIANCE receipt on the counter with the pen for him to sign. She put our food on the counter an just walked away. We could have had someone else food. She just waz RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL, SHE DON'T NEED TO BE AT THE FRONT COUNTER FOR ANY RESTAURANT. I wasted my money just threw the food away. I want a supervisor are you cooperated office to follow up. Order 0175 again at 1700 bill $ 14.33 I so upset I want to take further action she just rude didn't say nothing. Went to Robert's Taco Shop 1380 W. Cheyenne ave #103 North Las vegas, NV 89030 702 399- 9758 terminal id 01532293 4504"}
{"text":"We'll had a bad experience with co/workers at this office the cashier and cook was talking badly about me and my son. I had to call another Roberto's in summerlin in order to reach someone. We'll the manager return my call but I could not see my self going into that store. One the manager didn't believe how much I paid for my food which i can prove. Then got talk about in Spanish by your employees. I can get this off my mind when will this Racist stuff will stop."}
{"text":"OK. We went into this Roberto's and purchased 2 carne asada fries 2 chicken enchilada plate, I ordered 12 rolled taquitos.  Of course I'm a mother and full-time employee that works down in Las Vegas.  Since I had an early meeting in the morning I figured I would pick dinner. So of course I get my order the girl Ruth, she was sweet. Took my order. Very friendly. When I got home I didn't even bother to check my order.  The fries we're cold, the meat you can see was cold. The rolled tacos we're hard, they only put guacamole  on the top not through the order.  So I called the manger Ruth she said o I don't know what happened blah blah.  So I asked for the corporate office a Rey answered claiming he is the owner. He said he had to talk to his manger to see what she is willing to do for me. Are you kidding me. You are the owner buddy. Get it together. Then he wanted me to go get in my car and go back are you serious.  I don't have time for that. Is this how we really treat people? I spent 40.00 in this place. I could of gone to Lindo Michoacan for amount of money. Very disappointed guys. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's but this is the least favorite one I've ever gone. The girl who works during the day is the rudest employee I've ever encountered. She over charges for everything, and I get they are individually owned, so I honestly prefer to go to Don Tortaco across the street just because of her attitude."}
{"text":"Cashier told me I gave get a $10 but I gave her a $20. She quickly put it in the drawer so no way to challenge her.  Also the tostado I got had a hard substance like a rock. Be careful at this location. Bad people & bad food."}
{"text":"They started charging a fee to run a card as debit or as credit...maybe it's just the principle of the thing but I hate that I have to give them extra money so I can pay for my bill.  I've always been a fan of the place but I think I'm done now.  It's only 50 cents but it just does not sit well with me."}
{"text":"When you are driving home late at night and need a well made enchilada or chimichanga, this is the place to stop. Good bean and cheese burritos and 99 cent tacos on Wednesday as well. Open 24 hours and the staff has always been polite and gotten my order right. The decor is run down but the food is good, I like to call ahead and pick up my food to go."}
{"text":"Small pace but the food is incredible  Best burritos and tacos I have ever tried  The pickled carrots are delicious  A must try"}
{"text":"A fast food taco spot open 24/7 I'm from San Jose so I compare Mexican food to what I know that is good. Yes, the food here is filling and a bit pricy. I had the carne asada tacos and the chicken quesadilla. Both was okay, but it didn't satisfy my Mexican craving.  I'm sure this is great drunk food after a night of partying,"}
{"text":"I am gonna say this Robertos beats other Roberto.  Their sauce is not watery like the rest. It's supposed to have a nice spicy kick and flavor. Other places may have spice but tastes watery."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Cashier seemed completely annoyed by having to take our order and kept tapping her fingernails on the counter after asking us \"Anything else?\" at least 3 times even though it was obvious we weren't finished ordering. Her eyes and body language made it even worse. I had to clean our table with paper towels from the bathroom before we could even sit down. As we sat and ate I watched the same cashier treat other customers with the same annoyed attitude. Food was ok but pretty bland. Hot sauce was hot but really didn't have much flavor. Can't see myself returning based on this experience."}
{"text":"Yummy carne asada tacos!!!! Lots of carne asada in each one and their pico de galo is excellent.   The shredded beef isn't very flavorful, but the proportion of meat to cheese and lettuce is good in their tacos, and hand made hard shells are crispy but don't fall apart like other crispy taco shells.  Rolled tacos are good. Again, the meat doesn't have much flavor, but add their green salsa and it's no biggie. They are smothered with guacamole and cheese."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be open 24 hours correcct?  Well I barely can get in the door good and I was told that they were closed!  What do you mean closed? So didn't get me any breakfast this morning and allotted for that time to stop and get some there and didn't have time to go another place.  I went to another one by my house yesterday and they told me they were closed also!     What gives?  What kind of  24 hour place closes in the morning for whatever reason? Very extremely disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I been here so I stopped here before I had to have my labs drawn after fasting 12 hours so I'm starving. Place was clean as usual and ordered my food as soon as I walked in. Ordered me a steak breakfast burrito and they prepared it fresh.   Now I can get these labs done and go to work and finally eat!!!! Yes HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO!!! Since mexican food is my favorite I will be in a mexican food coma allll day!!!"}
{"text":"So my job has relocated here to Summerlin and decided to stop here and get me some breakfast since I'm a bit early.  Well when I first pulled up to the window the IDIOT say give me one moment.  Ok fine maybe he was still assisting someone, finishing up counting, or whatever it was that he needed to do I was ok with that.  Then the IDIOT comes back and say  \"YES\"?  I said excuse me are ready to take my order or are you ready to help me now?  The IDIOT says yeah go ahead.  I placed my order for my food and pulled around to the window.  He never came to the window but I could hear him talking to someone else and sounded like they were making my food.  When the IDIOT finally comes to the drive thru window with his ugly angry face he gave me the total and gave me my bag.  Took my card, charged it, and then handed me back my card.  He never asked me if I wanted condiments but I see in the bag he has already given me green salsa.  Perfect now can I have 1 more to go with my food since you  already assumed that is the one I wanted.  He then says there is some in the bag I said no I want one more.  So the IDIOT with his mean ugly face went and got me another one and slammed the window.   Never a thank you, have a great day, or anything else you need.  This has been the worst service I have ever received in my entire life!  You have taken a job to where you have to serve people and their needs when they come into the business that you are currently employed.  I don't care what kind of mood or day you are having you need to put on that face and do the job you were hired to do!  Period and no ifs ands or butts about it.  I hate when I receive horrible rude service from anybody and I always give what I would like to receive.    I will NEVER EVER come here to this Roberto's again and will try the one a little further down on Fort Apache.  I know if I call and talk to the manager it will be in vain cuz they probably could care less anyway so I'll put the horrible service I received from the stupid rude ugly IDIOT I received today.    DO NOT PATRON THIS ESTABLISHMENT SERVICE SUCKS.  Let's hope the food is at least ok."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time after having the munchies after the club. And the only thing that was open at 3am. I tried the manchata burrito and it was delicious. I went back the next day because i was hung over and somewhat helped.   I tasted my sweetheart carne asada burrito and it was just as good. The hot sauce was very bland and no flavor. Really wish they had a salsa bar cuz I'm a fan of spicy food.   The place was really clean and our food was made to order. The prior 0 people that took our order were very nice and friendly.   Overall good food and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Roberto's taste different depending on the location. Personally, I'm not a fan of the taco shops near gas stations...seems so unsanitary.  Anywhoo, this location is cleaner than the rest. My sister who came to visit swore this place had the best breakfast burrito. It was way passed 1 AM , she was drunk and hungry. I did have to admit that cold winter night the burrito was good.  Then we tried to recreate that moment couple months down the road..and the verdict was quite the opposite.  Something happened to the cheap magic of the breakfast burrito. It was awful this time around. The meat and potatoes were so overcooked and salty. You couldn't taste the fluffy egg. The whole thing was a flop. Will not return as it was simple a one hit wonder."}
{"text":"It's 3:30 late night early morning. You're on your way home after being in the club for who knows how many hours. They know you been drinking and no matter which way you take they're waiting for you, and being strategically placed around the city, they'll  get you before you make it home.   Yes, I'm talking about  Roberto's tacos. Open 24 hours and multiple locations. The chances of finding a Roberto's taco shop when you're drunk are as good as finding a McDonald's when you're sober.   Every time I go to Roberto's I have a hard time deciding what I want to order, ( besides having a hard time standing) everything is SO good. The machaca burritos and the rolled taquitos and the nachos and pretty much anything else that ends in \"os\" are my favorite!     So next time you're out and looking for something good and little greasy to help you soak some of the alcohol in your system. Robertos is the place!   And please don't use Roberto's as an excuse for drinking..... That's \"my\" excuse!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly services and clean and not too spicy and cheaper Mexican food and open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Roberto's can be found pretty much throughout LV. The food is excellent and well priced. What makes this place even more awesome is the fact that it's open 24hrs. We need this in California. During this specific visit I ordered a chicken chimichanga which came with R&B. The portions were so huge that I couldn't even finish it. More importantly the taste was really good and I tried to finish but just did not have the room. I ended up finishing the rest of the chimi R&B later and it held up well despite being in the fridge for 6 hours."}
{"text":"Made the switch from their carne asada fries to their carne asada nachos and I'm obsessed! Only reason I give four stars is because when you ask for extra cheese and sour cream only 5/10 they'll actually give it to you, which is a bummer. Still love this place though!"}
{"text":"While not the closest Roberto's to my house I still like coming to this location because the staff is nice and the place is kept clean. Along with that the sausage for the breakfast burrito are links vs patties which I find to be better so I love getting my breakfast burritos from this spot.   This location has a small congestion parking lot since a lot people cut through it to get to Wal Mart or the gas station and there is a bus stop right in front of it so it gets a little crazy at times. But overall a great place to get some Mexican food."}
{"text":"I ordered a drink and filled my cup with Dr.Pepper and ice. It smelled and tasted like mildew - absolutely disgusting. My mom went to go tell the woman and she seemed to not even care. At first we thought that the lid had mildew, then we thought it was the straw. The lady gave us a new cup, we smelled the cup, lid, and straw, and nothing smelled bad. My mom filled it with Dr. Pepper again and it was horrible. The soda smells and tastes like mildew. We told the lady and she offered to give us horchata. We declined and don't drink anything for the rest of this visit. This was stared our party down for the remaining time we stayed. It was getting uncomfortable. I already filed a report to the health department. Lastly, I tried to get napkins and she was avoiding eye contact while I was standing there. I didn't even need napkins, I just wanted A name. It look like she took it off because all the other employees had name tags With a picture. All in all, the food was good but little respect is given to the customers, plus the drink fountain had mildew build up. It will be getting inspected soon and I hope to hear that the Asian will get fired soon. I don't recommend this place whatsoever. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place !!! I Got the chicken tacos combination plate & my wife got a wet burrito with red sauce and melted cheese on top. My Daughter got the taquitos combo plate. Food tastes very authentic we ate here 2 days in a row while visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I hear a lot of complaints about Roberto's but I don't see why! I think as far as fast food taco shops go... this place is great! I really have no complaints about this place other than I've had better salsa. Oh, and any place that serves tongue is tops in my book! yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and this store meets the high standard of every Roberto's I've ever visited. There are few fast food restaurants offering vegetarian items on their menu so I am a regular. I always buy the bean and cheese burrito (quite a deal at $3.45), but there is quite a mark-up for extras ($1.10 for pico de gallo and $.50 for lettuce-totally worth it!). For the amount and quality of food you receive, this is a great place to stop when you need to pick up a quick lunch.   A great thing about Roberto's stores is that they also have a salsa bar. I'm not a fan of the salsas (too hot for this lily white girl), but I love the cucumbers, radishes, and carrots (okay, they're a little hot because they're mixed with whole jalapeños). Walking out the door with my tasty burrito filled with vegetables in addition to baggies full of veggies from the salsa bar for less than $6 is incredible.   Some things I don't like: --I'm not particularly impressed with their tortilla chips. They are made fresh, but I don't like the flavor.  --You do have to wait for your food, but it doesn't take long. Everything is made to order--no heat-lamps here!  Some things I like: --I really like that like Roberto's doesn't skimp of the size of their burritos. As an athlete, I'm often famished after a long run (13.1+ miles) or ride (75+ miles). This is my go-to place when I need to quickly replenish calories. --They're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I like their food especially the enchiladas. I got an order for a friend on Mother's Day and she loved it. The restaurant is very clean and the service is excellent. Oh, and the price is inexpensive and they have great salsa, and other garnishes that are a nice (free) addition to any meal. We're always happy when we chow down here."}
{"text":"You have eluded me...I had you once and I remember it was good. But my last outing to Vegas you escaped me.   I'm going to go to that Gas Station in which you hide and I'm going to get me one of your carne asada burritos, an order of carne asada fries AND a taco...ALL AT ONCE!!!  Next time...NEXT TIME for damn sure!  ****NOTE TO THE SBC**** DO IT!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people think this food is great. I went with beef tacos to see how they do the basics.. it was tasteless beef and the shell was soggy and tough to chew. I was surprised how tactless the entire meal was and how the special hot sauce had no flavor. Sad to say.. it was really sub par food."}
{"text":"Good late night food. Had the carne asada and fish tacos. Very tasty as always and service is pretty quick considering made to order."}
{"text":"We go here when it's wednesday. The tacos are $1. And to break it, it's made with chicken.  Add a couple of limes and now it's flavor land."}
{"text":"Stopped by at 2 in the morning with the homies. I ordered the Carne Asada 1/2 Fries and 1/2 Chips and a Dr. Pepper. I spent just under $10. It was just ok. I guess everyone else who yelped about these Carne Asada Fries was eating these while they were drunk so it tasted hella good. I was sober and it was just ok."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out again on chicken taco Thursday and we were pleased with the service. It was a bit busy so we had to wait a bit for our food to come out but they were adequately staffed to get through their peaks in volume. The food came out hot and delicious, and the staff was friendly. My only complaint was that there was water all over the floor in front of the soda machine."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst customer service I've had at Roberto's lady was super super rude and the place was disgusting! Needless to say I decided not to eat there and I am hungry!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a staple in my life. I can get a hefty meal at a reasonable price ($5 for a bean and cheese burrito with lettuce and pico de gallo). Their burritos are filling and perfect after a long bike ride or run. I also like their salsa bar. Though the salsas are far too hot for my white-girl tastes, I fill up on carrots (yes, they are HOT, but I grin and bear it), cucumbers, and radishes before I dig into my main meal. That way, I've had my fill of healthy vegetables and I have burrito leftovers for a snack later that day or the next.  My sons love the cheese quesadillas. They are basically heart-attacks-in-a-box--a carb/fat feast that is absolutely delicious.  Some of the employees (and many of the customers) don't speak English so you know you're getting authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Introduced by a friend right after I moved to Nevada. Love the food and service (although drive-through has gotten my order wrong a couple of times). Overall, excellent experience and very satisfying meals. Price is right, too."}
{"text":"Wednesday night is dollar taco night.  Can't go wrong.  Best darn tacos and burritos I've ever had.  And the Super Nachos (carne asada) will hit the spot. Nice and clean.  I've seen a couple other Robertos that were a little \"tired\" looking.  The Aliante shop is very clean and the folks there are genuinely pleasant."}
{"text":"Finally found a solid Mexican joint great foods solid prices staff can't speak a word in English which is ok because they can throw down in that kitchen.   Must try their Carne Asada Fries I'll post a pick of it POWERRR"}
{"text":"Came here from the airport. Ordered the carnitas burrito which was okay.  Had salsa and gucamole also in the burrito. I should have ordered sour cream, rice, cheese, and beans to put inside which I saw on the menu later on. I like they have a salsa bar with 2 different types of salsa and lime. Another plus is that they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say...It's Mexican food Fast! And I'm a white guy! We usually like the food here...Try to not eat there due to some gross looking tile and grout that there cleaning with dirt and grease from the parking lot...The utensils to grab the vinegar carrots with is always buried in the salsa...Typically some 400lb lady with her belly is hanging over the counter as well grabbing like a tupperware full of carrots and jalapeños out the door...The bathrooms here are nasty (i hold it for as long as possible) Those beans have quite a affect on your colon...One other observation in the store is , if you look to the right where the cashier is, take a good look at that 50 Year anniversary poster is, I swear thats a picture of Judge Judy and some Man from Home Depot...LOL"}
{"text":"If there were zero stars that's what they would get...ate there today...crappy food! The guacamole was disgusting and nothing but watered down green mush...not even sure they use acual Avacado's! Ugh, don't eat there...save your money!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like a late night pit stop at Robertos. It won't disappoint! Love the chimichanga, chili relleno, burritos, and enchiladas!"}
{"text":"My family and just about everyone I know loves Robertos for some great tasting, convenient and quick Mexican food. My daughter loves the chicken chimichanga and I love the combo plate with a chili relleno and enchilada. The carne Assad's fries are also pretty amazing. Honestly I can't think of anything that Robertos doesn't do well."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I ordered the refried beans, rice, and a burrito. When the food came out, this huge burrito was on my plate. The refried beans were good, however, the steak burrito was one of the absolute best that I have in my life! Amazing. Good experience. I will return."}
{"text":"I should of went by the star ratings..... Having returned to LV, Robertos was once a good fix for the craving of real CaliMex food. Not anymore. Ok, I can look past the mindless kid taking my order incorrectly, after getting all the way home to find my food slathered in avocado and tomatoes, which I had requested NO avo NO pico and NO apologies. NO flavor, boiled beef, ugh.  So many other choices now. Adios Robertos"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I just don't get. Attached to a full service car wash/gas station and a convenience store this place is always hopping with folks getting food to go. I have tried this location about a dozen times in the 10 years we lived in Vegas and it was always just decent, every other time. Remember I said decent not good.   The food is always prepared overly salty, never the same portion any time you order it and every fourth time they give you the wrong to go order. Note that I don't order anything fancy here as nothing is fancy, I just order one of the beef taco combo plates.  There is no consistency with the food proportions and the way it's cooked. Sometimes the tacos are out of this world and served hot and sometimes the food is cold by the time I drive 5 minutes down the road and the beans taste old and they've salted my beef taco to death. In the second scenario I just end up throwing it in the trash after two bites.  Perhaps the secret to this place is to either be so drunk you don't notice how bad the food is or to take your to go order and sit down in one of the dirty, never bussed, communal round tables so you can scarf it down as your car gets washed or your gas gets pumped, that way the taste of the overly salty food just passes quickly through your taste buds. One more thing, this place employs the grumpiest, most un-friendly counter staff. Try smiling at them when you're paying and tipping 20% and all you get is a grumpy look or a scowl. Advice lighten up guys you're supposed to want customers to return.  If you want real authentic Mexican food in a clean place where people preparing your food not only prepare it with love and give you service with a smile, head to Pepe's. You'll be better off and be glad you didn't spend $9.95 on a taco plate."}
{"text":"Never again! 0 stars!! Ordered a Chicken burrito and it's was super soggy and water was just dripping out it , pretty much fell apart in my hands. The staff was not at all friendly and the Place is dirty. Go to Taco Y Taco on Trop & Pecos , much much better.."}
{"text":"Wow.  I walked it to the employees sleeping in the booths. One didn't even wake up. ...............................................::::..........."}
{"text":"Best robertos on the east side!!! It's always clean inside, the workers are always friendly, and the food is always so good!!! There are other robertos closer to where I live, but I'm always willing to drive the extra mile to this one! Do not skip this location, I promise you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I've been here before and was disappointed, rice and beans had no flavor...I decided give it one more try so I ordered the California burrito,  once again I left disappointed the meat had so much pepper and that's about the only flavor, had maybe 4 fries in it....really makes me wonder if they don't know how to season food, I'm giving up on this place I will go back to Don Tortaco"}
{"text":"I was looking for a taco shop with a salsa bar.  This place had it!  My local favorite taco shop in LA could take a lesson from this place.  I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas and added rice and beans to go.  That thing was so heavy!  The enchiladas were stuffed with excellent quality chicken cooked with peppers and onions. So good!  The rice and beans were just okay.  Service was fast and friendly.  It's not far from where we stay when we come to Vegas, so I will probably be back!  Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I've now eaten here for the last time. They consistently get orders wrong and act like customers being there is a hastle to them. I will oblige and not be in the way anymore. I implore others to do the same.  Every time I order anything with Carne Asada it is consistently cold. Like the meat is kept on a line and then just thrown in whatever I order. I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of cold burritos. The final straw was Adobada fries I order this evening. They didn't even bother to cook the fries. They were all soggy had that horrible raw potato taste. I'm done eating here unless some major changes are made."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday after a long weekend in Vegas, im sure we all know how we feel on those Sundays after these \"type\" of \"long\" weekend in Vegas haha.  I needed something oily greasy and Mexican to eat haha so this was the right place.   The Horchata was not only refreshing and delicious but above average. I understand that the way Horchata is liked can be totally subjective so just as an FYI i love mine extra gritty however not to sweet. (sounds like my last relationship)  The rolled tacos were also very yummy. Burrito was a plus too!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Get the smothered bean and cheese burrito you will not be disappointed! It was covered in enchilada sauce that was amazing."}
{"text":"I order breakfast burrito to go when I get home start eating it it's not breakfast burrito it's potato burrito look at the picture I eat almost half of the half of the burrito still potato in it just little egg I can see I heard don Tortaco is own by robertos  I normally buy at don Tortaco especially if I don't have time to make breakfast but there's is a lot better to robertos definitely not eating any robertos anymore every bite I did I can feel the big chunk of potato and can't taste the egg"}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in an order, they won't start making your food until you pay anyways. I Love Roberto's but this is the worst one I've seen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's location! They have the best tasting food and the most friendly staff!"}
{"text":"When I feel the need for some greasy and thick mexican food..I head straight to Roberto's!! Whichever location you choose, you can't go wrong..they all have the same taste.  I always get the #4 combo plate..2 hard shell beef tacos w/ rice and beans.  Price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give.  I really like the fact that they are open 24hrs also so after a night of clubbin, it soaks up all the alcohol! :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of carne Asada fries and have only eaten them from Arizona and California restaurants this place was close to where I was staying so I ordered my favvv food and let me tell you they were amazing! Definitely in the top 10 I've ever had. Service was fast and nice as well. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat after a night of partying ! Great food , good prices ! Good for hangover ."}
{"text":"I ordered there before and they forgot the sour cream and this time I ordered a chicken burrito and got a beef, when I went to return it they gave me a hard time and I explained that is not what I ordered and the worst part is I ordered chicken not beef and they looked at me clueless! just got my money back and went to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"This particular Roberto's is by  far the classiest and cleanest one I've ever been to, and  being that I'm from San Diego, I've been a LOT! It seems that the \"California Burrito\" (carne asada burrito with fries or some format of potatoes) is almost always only found in said state. Not the case here!  AND they're 24hrs! Ive drunkenly wandered in here many a morning! Good times!"}
{"text":"I'll have a three rolled beef with guacamole combo, cheese quesadilla with guac, some chicken tacos, and extra quac. Thank you. That is all."}
{"text":"Late drunk night and this gem was still open!!! This place is pretty big. As late as it was there was still people lining up to get food.  The staff was friendly and even though there was 1 chef he got that food out pretty fast!! Again it was really late and they still had smiles on their faces. Such cool employees.  I ordered the california burrito!! Soooooo goood!! The tortilla was warm, the fries were crispy, the meat was juicy and had a lot of that latin flavor! It had a small kick to it too so that was a plus!   The sauces they had on the side were pretty good. Just becareful with the red one!!! I didnt think it was gonna be that spicy but damn... my mouth waas burning for a good 10 minutes off a good size dab on my burrito.   All in all this spot was great!!"}
{"text":"Today I went to Roberto's on ranching and lake mead and it was a disappointing experience! It started with a lady working there that kept grunting and yelling about some drama that was going on in that location. When I say grunting, it was loud because I was in the drive thru and she was in the back somewhere and the lady helping me was more interested in her drama than helping me!  So I finally get my carne asada breakfast burrito and it was bland! It was so under seasoned that the water down red chili couldn't help it! Why because the chili was bland and had zero heat or flavor as well!   So disappointing, that robertos is turning into a fast food chain! What they are today and what they were before are two polar opposite restaurants! You can tell that they have new leadership, just by looking at their cheesy marketing posters and flyers taped all over the place. Roberto's stop trying to be like the other fast food places because they suck and stay true to your brand and produce quality and not fast food!"}
{"text":"Roberto's does not disappoint with their food, but their dining room is always dirty. The tables do not seem to be wiped and the floor is always dirty when I come in here.   Now that I think about it, what goes on in the kitchen?! I tried to look for their rating but I didn't see it!!! Man, I don't know if I'll ever be back here."}
{"text":"While heading out to the lake to fish with the boy, we stopped in for a high calorie meal knowing it would be hours before we ate again.  The morning crew (server & cook) were not very friendly.  WTF!  I said good morning and I was smiling. Sadness crept over me until I saw a \"local\" being received with much adoration..I get it. I ordered up some carne asada which I found to dry and without flavor.  Next time before punching out of Hendo, I will hit another south of the border eat spot.."}
{"text":"I dunno how the other folks reviewing could possibly have a bad experience here. This place is absolutely delicious. Don't pay attention to the nay sayers."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!   Staff: The staff here are great!!   Food: I love the food here! Everything I've tried is wonderfully delicious! My favorite is the bean and cheese burrito and their red sauce! Their red hot sauce is to die for! Soo good!   Cost: Super affordable!   Can not say enough good things about this place.   Yummy yummy!!"}
{"text":"Who can beat fresh authentic chicken tacos for a buck?  The answer is no one!  This place is awesome for any mexican food but if you stop by on wednesdays, you have to get them.  I also love the horchata if you enjoy that sort of thing"}
{"text":"This location sucks. The employees suck. And the food sucks. Went last night and was extremely disappoint with every aspect. The front lady was just so rude I couldn't believe it. The soda machine was out of ice so I asked if she could refill it and she looked at me like I just asked her for $1000 and free food. She told me there was nothing she could do. Lol ok.   As for the food, blahhh. Chips were burnt and taco was covered in oil. They also had no limes, only lemons. What Mexican place has no limes??   Whatever, I won't be back. I usually go to Don Tor Taco, and wished I did last night."}
{"text":"First and last time coming here. Uncle lives just up the street so I figured we stop by for some tacos. Food was okay. No complaints there. Now the cashier taking our order was absolutely rude. I'm sorry if you dislike your job but don't take your frustration out on others ."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab some food on the way to see the Hoover Dam.  Breakfast burrito was on point.  Also ordered the steak burrito which was great as well.  The burritos were just slightly crispy on the outside and all the meats were delicious and everything was just so perfect with all the ingredients being in proportion with each other in every bite. If you're traveling out of town to see the Hoover Dam/Grand Canyon during your Vegas trip, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time I eat here, Carne Asada chimi, they make it just how I like it. They have churro's but I wish they had the fruit filled ones that would make a nice finish to my meal. I usually eat here for lunch from time to time they are quick and my food is always made correctly. My husband orders a variety of things and has always been happy with his choices from California burrito or the carne asada plate. The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathroom which for a lot of semi fast food places with a lot of traffic is not. There is a language barrier because most of the ladies that work in there know not a lot of English so the customer service is not bad but it's minimal communication with them. They are reasonably priced and huge portions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from del taco and taco bell."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Roberto's in all of Las Vegas, the owner or old lady is always there watching her workers and she has such a bad lady vibe to her. The customer service is a zero star, the place is gross. I asked for some green salsa because what was out there look like shit and the lady went to the back got some green salsa and went into the bathroom... Why did she go to The bathroom? I don't know, you tell me."}
{"text":"So I think it's pretty shitty that they charge you to use your visa, and not very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, maybe a bit too much! Food is always good, staff is quick."}
{"text":"Service was Tolerant so I get it ... food was food but I'm a cheese and sour cream junkie   Cost as much as another item   I'm going back, I'm just bringing my own cheese, sour cream and guacamole   I asked for it on the side but never got it..   Good meat for a pretty price, BRING CASH and sides or extras... cvs is across the street..."}
{"text":"Very good!  I had the Carne asada fries, and Carne asada taco,  and my daughter had a cheese quesadilla.  Muy delicioso!  Roberto's is officially my go to Mexican food spot.  Service was fast, food was good, and it's open 24 hours.  Doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Meh. And that's all I have to really say. I was craving mexican since I was close enough to the west coast, but I have learned my lesson that the best mexican food is in Cali.  I really had a thing for tacos for some reason around this time and wanted some rolled tacos. They were just...okay. Wasn't anything to write home about. I didn't even finish them. Ummm the best thing I can say about them was that the food came quick and they were within walking distance of the outlet mall. Dassit."}
{"text":"Worst location of the franchise . I used to go to this location 2 am almost every single night when I got of work since I lived across the street. One night I came in to see that they had made changes due to the fact that they had been robbed . Understandable but how about when I came in the cook left the building .... what to smoke drugs before my order or wtf eigher way just straight up left with me the only one in the store at he time . Returned to cook the food . Took forever and made it with such horrible care that even the food wasn't right at all ........ stay away .... I pray everyone uses a different Roberto's ... this location is a joke .... they don't even let you use the restroom there .... wtf   If I could this location compared to the others gets 0 stars"}
{"text":"This location is a little gem! There are just times when you don't feel like cooking or are super lazy! The DRIVE-THRU is HEAVEN ON EARTH. The wait is never really that long and the food is really good at this location. I have been here multiples time, both dine-in and drive-thru! My guilty pleasures are the California burrito (carne asada, french fries, cheese, no pico), breakfast burrito and the rolled tacos! The staff is always friendly and the service is always good. Please visit if you are craving a quick Mexican food meal."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday as this was my first time I got to say the food was delicious a little greasy but what do you expect from a taco place. The only negative I can say about this place is that it is pricey so be expected to pay a little more then what you intended to pay because that's what happened to me and the was a meal for two people that wasn't that much food anyhow the customer service is good you get alot of bigger portions to choose from compared to other taco places overall I will be back."}
{"text":"Ate at this robertos location on Saturday with a friend of mine and I really like this robertos as it is a little bit bigger then the other robertos locations I've been to the customer service here is good and I really enjoyed the food my friend got the rolled tacos with sour cream and guacamole and I got the California burrito with Carne asada and cheese that was the bomb haven't used that word in along time but it was made me miss eating one of those in California even though the ones out there taste better this one was close anyhow I see my self checking out this location when I get the chance the place is clean can't say much about the bathrooms as I didn't go in there but I'm pretty sure they keep them clean other then that I think I will come back to this robertos again."}
{"text":"My wife and i game here for a quick bite to eat before we headed  for home this place had good reviews and had a steady line of customers so you would think they would have good mexicam food boy was i wrong i order a carne asada burrito no flavor what so ever and my wife had the #2 combo which came with bean tostada ,cheese enchalada beans and rice the cheese wasn't even melted and no flavor."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food place that is open 24 hours. Chicken burrito had lots of delicious meat, but no beans. Next time I will try carne asada burrito. Chicken torta was good too."}
{"text":"They're breakfast burritos are huge! And they only cost $5. I recommend getting the bacon. Even the tortilla is hand-made."}
{"text":"Worst robertos restaurant ever . Every time me and my fiancé go to Vegas we pay a visit to robertos . We normally go to the one off Bermuda but after a long night we uber to the nearest one. Food looked disgusting didn't even look appetizing . The orchata was heavily watered down. Service was horrible . This place is a disservice to the robertos food chain ."}
{"text":"Everything fell out of my quesadilla when I picked it up. The one good thing was the rice and I have to pay extra for rice and beans. The menu price online does not reflect in stores. I'd rather have gone to chipotle."}
{"text":"I'm partial to Faustos. This place is below average in quality and quantity. In the future, I'll drive out of my way for Faustos or make my own nacho. I believe I've given Roberto's enough of my business to not need to return.  Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"I waited in the drive through for 30 minutes. Not good customer service. I actually called the restaurant to see if the drive-thru was open and the employee said she  was the only one working the front counter. More staff would be great"}
{"text":"My most favorite Robertos in the valley! The carnitas are excellent and the rice and beans are good as well. The staff have always been very very friendly even when I'm standing there like an idiot trying to figure out wth I want lol. They always get my order correct because everyone can't just order it either needs no guac or no pico de gallo my family is insane! I want all the fixings lol! Happy eating"}
{"text":"Came in and ordered 3 tacos. Watched my order sit in the back waiting to be bagged as this bitch handed out everybody else's order (including multiple people that came after me) I asked if that was my order and the cashier gave me a shitty attitude and said yes but they hand them out in the order they're received. I asked how come she just gave other customers that came after us their food in that case. She just said \"that's how we do it\" Never going back."}
{"text":"This place use to be really good! The last 2 times I've been there it's been awful!!! It's always cold and the taco shell was so hard! It was over fried! Need to find a better quality food!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. The staff can't even concentrate long enough to take an order. The customers in front of us had a food allergy. When they received their order wrong, we got to watch the staff tell them they were wrong. Then the person showed them the food. Rather than just fix it, the cook and front argued about who messed up. Top it off with dirty bathrooms. Thanks Roberto's for re-confirming why I don't come here."}
{"text":"I got a chicken burrito recently and I love Mexican food but this did not do it for me. I'm from LA, so perhaps I have bigger expectations but I won't be returning. This was my 2-3rd time hoping it would get better but I'll stick to a hole in the wall instead."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Roberto's for a while but I felt as if I had to write a review today for this one. I am a huge fan of California burritos and some of the Roberto's have been changing up their style. Not this one, had the french fries and all, I will definitly be making special trips to get them!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken chimichanga and a regular Pepsi the other night. The cashier was unclear when telling me the total. I handed her $15 and only got $1 and some change back? I didn't realize til I got home and she did not give me a receipt. Part of it was my fault but the cashier should not steal from customers. This location is also inconsistent in their food. Sometimes there would be a lot of meat and other times, there would be little to no meat. They sometimes would forget the utensils too."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!!!!#!# We've tried eating at this location twice since we recently moved to this neighborhood.  The first time I ordered chicken nachos that were pretty soggy,  but edible.  However, this time I ordered a chicken tostada, chicken quesadilla and menudo. Both chicken meals were completely inedible!  There was chicken broth that completely covered the bottom of both containers and they forgot the tortillas for the menudo.  When we went back the man that prepared the food came to say that was completely normal. I have never ate a soggy tostada or quesadilla from any other place in my life,  so please don't give me that bull!  This same man started speaking to the cashier in Spanish hoping that we didn't understand him, but my husband did and he was rude and dismissive. Not once did anyone utter an apology and a way to make amends of the problems!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to visit, this is where I HAVE to come to eat! This place is incredible, burritos are simply the best! Mocho Nachos are by far the best I have ever had and the three roll tacos are mouth watering. Highly recommend any Roberto in the Las Vegas valley"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of my coworkers. We are regulars since it's so close to work. All our orders were made perfectly! Absolutely loved the chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"I sat at the drive thru waiting to place my order and nobody took my order. Last time I will ever go to this roberto's. It says Mexican fast food. They need to change that to slow as fuck."}
{"text":"Not gonna Lie this is probably some of the best Drunk food ever to go for.  Open 24/7 with heaping amounts of food for cheap price.   You cant go wrong there.   With this one having a drive thru it's made qutie a few evenings that much more convenient.  The staff is usually pretty friendly with me in the drive thru and my food always seems to come pretty quick.  What else can really be said for a drive thru mexican dine in!  I get a beef burrito and cheese enchilada with a cheese quesadilla on the side.   Probably some of the most unheathiest stuff but shh if your coming here in the first place who's really caring at that point? ;)"}
{"text":"Check your food before you leave... only the tiniest sprinkle of cheese on my carne asada nachos... Nachos...are not nachos without cheese!!! :("}
{"text":"Best Robertos I've ever been to in Las Vegas. Very clean, cool retro look, nice staff who actually speaks and understands English very fluently. Other Robertos I've been too in Vegas was dirty, building looked rundown and old, and the people who worked their could barely even speak English. I am not being racist or want to be perceived as being a racist but I am just stating facts.  Anyways, the food is always great and on point at this location. I visit this Robertos about 3-4 times a week to grab breakfast or dinner. The bacon, eggs, and potatoes breakfast burritos are amazing and very filling. And they're all under $5 for 1/2 lb chunk burrito.   For dinner you can't go wrong with the Carne Asda fries or anchors or the rolled toquitos. Your choice of beef or chicken. Condiments such as cucumbers, limes, and sauces are always fresh and the area is always clean unlike other Robertos in this town.  Some of the specials they have to offer is wet bean and cheese burrito Mondays for $3.99, Chicken burrito Tuesdays for $3.99 (Mon. & Tues. offers come with a drink and a side of beans and rice), and 99 cent taco Wednesdays.  I don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"Best robertos taco shop around in the 702! Recently remodeled and looks amazing!  Mirta does her best as a owner and got things going on the right path!"}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when my friend told me there was a Roberto's in Vegas.  Normally I would have to wait till I was in San Diego, but since I was in Vegas, I saw no valid reason not to pay them a visit.  Unlike crazy Grace C. who complained about them having too much meat, I welcome it with open arms.  I love their Carne Asada fries.  Whoever thought about putting juicy carne asada on top of fries is a genius!  Since moving back to LA, whenever I craved the fries I have to resort to going to Alberto's.  It's not bad, but it's not Roberto's.  The meat they use at Alberto's is sOo dry and veiny.  It's not just the most pleasant taste, but when you got a craving, you gotta satisfy it.   We ordered the Carne Asada Fries, which were good.  Could use a bit more fries, but nonetheless just as satisfying as before... besides better more meat than hardly any!  It's all about getting your money's worth. The chicken burrito was juicy!  Large pieces of chicken, no beans, no rice...  just plain delicious!  My favorite Roberto's is probably still the one in SD, but this definitely kept true to it's chain.  Every Roberto's I've been to, has kept their restaurant neat and clean.  Nothing is worst than getting mexican food from a messy place!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and the price is perfect.  I can get a healthy size bean and cheese burrito for less than $3.  On Wednesday's they have $1 chicken tacos."}
{"text":"I'm not a big \"Oh, that's a bad place because it's not authentic\" kind of person but I sure do love my Mexican food to the Tee.   For a place called a \"taco shop,\" I expected their tacos to be their best thing on the menu. Not! Their tacos were alright and I hate to say it but, they sort of taste like the tacos from Taco Bell lol.   2nd time, I came and got a bowl of menudo. Again, not too bad, but I've had better.   Sure this place is open 24 hours and yes, it'll satisfy hangovers, but I still expected better."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was horrible. I know it's not much of a big deal,  but when I went, I ordered my food and a drink. And CLEARLY on the menu it says that the cups are for their soft drinks and their special drinks as well.. (Including Horchata and etc.) so I was just planning to fill my drink with Diet, and then Horchata by the time I would be leaving. I went up (the Horchata was behind the counter) and the lady said she had to charge me $1 extra. And I kept saying that I don't see the extra charge anywhere on the menu.. And all she kept saying was \"I know it's not on the menu, but I still have to charge.\" Like what the hell? Why? There's no official pricing of an up charge, so I refused to pay for it.. And of course like any other horrible employee, she just kept pointing to the phone number on the wall and told me to talk to the manager. No point in wasting my time on an employee's ignorance. Thank goodness there's a Don Tortaco right down the street.. Don't waste your time here. Also, here's a picture clearly stating EVERYTHING is included when purchasing a drink."}
{"text":"Great food and we've always had great service there. The employees are alway helpful and polite. The only reason We didn't give it a 5 star is because it's not open 24 hours, or at least til 2am."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop - 10030 W. Cheyenne Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89129 I love this location and the food. I tell my husband everytime we eat their food that I would rather order this and take it home than go to  any Mexican Restaurant's here in town. I have read otehr reviews where peole say it's not 'authentic' tasting, but my taste buds think otherwise!  The staff here are so nice and they are very quick."}
{"text":"Late night Mexican food is a nice change from regular fast food. I've had the shrimp cocktail, carne asada burrito and their enchiladas.  All good but the beans and enchiladas are a barely warm. Other that the heat issue, I get fast service and it's way better than grease filled burger drive throughs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Mexican food and he recommend we go to Roberto's to satisfy our cravings. The establishment is open 24/7. When we entered I was really indecisive of what I wanted since I am a foodie, I wanted everything. The worker informed us whenever we are ready to order.  While we were waiting a lot of drunk men came in and sitting on things they were not to sit on like AC vent, table and being really obnoxious. The worker was really chill about it and informed them to please stop doing that and they obliged. I get distracted easily so we let them go first since I was still having a hard time deciding what I wanted.  I narrowed it down to something cheesy and with a lot of sauce and my boyfriend suggested I get the wet burrito and add chicken. We were ready to order and the worker was being so rude to my boyfriend, literally screaming at him through the microphone which hurt my ears. The worker informed us that they cannot add chicken to my burrito because they have a \"no substitution\" policy...which was bogus because we are not substituting anything just adding.   So I wanted more time to rethink what I wanted but the worker was just staring at me impatiently so I ordered the Chile Rellano plate. The worker was still being rude. We decided to get a Piña drink and it tasted like stale cardboard...not real pineapples at all. We are waiting for our food and other people come in and the worker is talking to them normally over the microphone -_-   The food was good but the service was poor on how they treated my boyfriend and I. I know it is late at night and having a decisive customer can be annoying but they should still be handled professional. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is not a very good one compared to others for several reasons.    Order the same food here, as you would at other Roberto's and you will find you do not get the same amount of meat or cheese or beans or rice.  You will get less.  The last time we went there was very little beef in my husband's chimi --it was mostly beans.  My chicken chimi was better- more meat - but still, lots of beans.  Greasy, greasy, greasy.  Yes, fried food is greasy, but here it is ridiculous.  The tacos drip forever.  We tried this location several times thinking it was just a bad day for them- but we were wrong.  This is how they prepare food there.    Skip this Roberto's - our favorite is the one on south Las Vegas Blvd, next to the Outback."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Roberto's.  Food here is excellent, the place is always clean and the people who work here are great.  2 complaints, that don't amount to much - if you eat in, the music is too loud, and the bells on the door ear-splitting if someone really swings it.  If you are taking food home, no worries."}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome. The only issue we had was the language barrier. Ordering everything we wanted was a little difficult."}
{"text":"Our late night craving for Mexican fast food was calling to us, so we decided to go to this place. It has what we needed. It was very filling, service was fast, and the price was reasonable. We will definitely be back when the craving hits us again."}
{"text":"This location is busy. If you are on a lunch break I suggest phoning your order in because the wait can be long especially on Wednesdays when chicken tacos are only .99 cents. I got a carne asada burrito, rolled beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla. All was above average for a hole in the wall chain. Some people think 'berto's is only good when your drunk and depending on the location you're right but this one is decent."}
{"text":"It's Roberto's. They have locations all over in different states and most people know Roberto's is the place to eat when it's late at night and you are desperate for food. Each location is hot or miss as far as consistency goes. This location is apart of a gas station but you walk up to the window from outside. The portion size here is great. A lot of the menu items can easily be shared. The Carne Asada Burrito is what I order with just meat and cheese. The tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzly. I saw a huge block of cheese just sitting out on the counter instead of being in a refrigerated space that didn't look right. I realized after this last visit that with all the other food trucks that offer great Mexican food at affordable prices, I really have no need to come to Roberto's as much."}
{"text":"Come to back to town once a year and look forward to my roberto's .. was disappointed this trip got my stand by chimichanga and it was just ok . Carne Asada was bland and not hot cheese inside not melted beans were cool not hot. Charged 1 dollar to use a credit card up sell on carne asada by 2 dollars . I get this location is across from hard rock but extremely disappointed making me think of changing to a alternate next year"}
{"text":"With all the other locations of Roberto's you're better off driving a few miles to another one. The workers here are rude and I have been ignored every time I've been there. I've given this place a few chances considering its so close to me and I would love a good Roberto's by my place but it's not worth it anymore, every single time they have screwed up my order in multiple ways. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My worst eating experience, EVER! I found a band-aid in my nachos here, and when I went back the staff pretended not to speak English. All this while they had a sign on their wall that said \"Voted Best in Las Vegas.\" This happened to me in 2002, mind you, but I'll never forget that experience. I sincerely hope they have improved on the standards since then, but I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"These restaurants keep their standards high and the fellas are sharp and fast. If you have an order for the office this is the place to bring it. They are fast, efficient, and the food is all delicious."}
{"text":"These guy are amazing, the breakfast burritos with ham and everything are awesome. I have been here at all hours; In my pajamas on Inauguration Day , after work and on my way to work. They never fail, give these guys a try, they're nice too and deserve a tip.  One thing: If you add a tip to your receipt they do not process it, so take a buck in with you."}
{"text":"This is the best Roberto's I have been to, the food quality is exceptional the staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. I drive 15 minutes to come to this location even though there are other Roberto's closer to me."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the staff is horrible. They have a young female cashier here with glasses that looks miserable. I was eating in and she was talking to a costumer and he couldn't hear her so she yelled at him... This robertos needs a new staff!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with Roberto's I used to eat it all the time back home and I was really happy to learn that there was one just down the street from where I live now. I love this place."}
{"text":"This location is iffy... It's a hit or miss... Roberto's is decent food but like I said a hit or miss.  Last year I was going to write a review about the service and go into detail about how poor it was. Then they got new people and it became better.  Lately it's been GREAT service but the quality of the food has adjusted.  My \"go to\" when I come to Roberto's is either: the Chile relleno burrito, breakfast burrito, carne asada fries, shredded beef chimichanga or the carne asada quesadilla.  The only one they haven't fucked up (yet... lol) is the quesadilla... if that goes to shits I might have to make a trip to the one on Lamb Haha...   Anyway... their portions have gotten smaller. Maybe they're trying to cut portion costs? Who knows but they've gotten smaller.  My biggest thing that's been bugging me, why I decided to write this review (and most likely who would actually read a Roberto's review but why not)  The Chile relleno burrito. The pepper hasn't been cleaned out properly. They take the stem off but the inside still has A SHIT LOAD OF SEEDS.   That's about it..."}
{"text":"All I have to say is:  Fausto's is waaaaaaay better than Roberto's!   Never get the food hot, always so-so, window person never understands English and even has a hard time understanding Spanish (every location it seems!), slow service, last time we ordered a shrimp burrito and after explaining what shrimp was at least 5 times we opened the food container and saw a BEEF burrito.  I can't eat here anymore, especially after eating Fausto's (which also seems to be cheaper). I hate saying it, but there's a Wendy's across the street and you're better off eating there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I am in Las Vegas I always eat here before I head home! The taquitos aka rolos are amazing! Bean and cheese burritos,  carne asada fries, carne asada quesadilla are all devine!! They have fresh salsas, radishes, pickled jalapenos and carrots! The place is always clean and the worker's/cashier are freaking polite all the time!! They take cash, credit cards and the parking is ample and best this is they are open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"I use to like this place, but tonight the food was cold and undesirable. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's about time I update my view.  Since my first review, I have been to this location once or twice a month.  I have learned to take an early lunch at 10:00 AM in order to truly beat the rush.  Ordering and seating have never been an issue when stopping by.  Ha!  Looking at my previous I see my empty threat of saying I would not return.  I AM a slave to convenience.  Every order has been deliciously accurate.  The best part has been the customer service.  My little smug cashier is no more.  She smiles, is friendly and on my most recent visit called me by my first name.  JOY!  On that same visit, they were more than helpful when coworkers later called me to field an order.  The line was long, but one of the kind ladies slaving her ass on the girl saw me, asked me what I needed, I told her and by the time I made it to the front, the chow was waiting for me.  These acts of kindness equal loyalty followed by an update.  Yay!  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Roberto's in Roberto's this one just happens to have a drive thru. I'm lazy so the drive thru at this 'berto's is great when I'm having lunch in the area, which I have been more often so this location is convenient. A carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla top off my tank just most of the time. The tortillas they use here are bomb.com and the cheese is shredded fresh. The red and green sauce are good too and they don't skimp on the amount put into your bag. Cheap and satisfying lunch. Drive thru can back up and the only negative would be the way you have to pull in and enter the drive thru because it's a tight squeeze and rather confusing the first time trying to get in. If paying with credit or debit card they charge .50 cents for that."}
{"text":"Stop going there when they changed 50 cent to used a debit card. Left a bad taste in my mouth ."}
{"text":"Robertos was on my food list for my October trip.  I tried it and well, meh.  First, let me say I like the set up of the serve yourself salsa bar.  I like that they have three kinds of salsa and that lovely melange of spicy carrots and onions .  That was the highlight.  The food left me disappointed.  I ordered:  1. 3 Rolled Chicken Tacos- they were the skinniest, hardest, blandest things I tried to eat.  I had them add guac to go on top.  I stopped after eating one and a half.  They were sad.  And that \"guac\"?  Someone ought to be arrested selling that as guac.  It was like eating sour cream with green food coloring.   2.  Steak Tacos - I have never had steak tacos so bland.  I doused them with the tomatillo sauce giving it much needed help.  The only thing that tasted fresh and was hot?  3.  Cheese Quesadilla - imagine that.  A simple quesadilla was the only thing I finished and enjoyed.  If I could make a meal from cheese quesadillas and the salsa bar, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Okay, let's atart with the salsa bar. This was my first time going into Robertos and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the selections of salsas. There were only two to choose from. There was a red and a green. I looked for Pico de Gallo but there wasn't any. I have to say both salsas were very good. The red one was much spicier than the green but both had a nice kick.   On to the bean and cheese burrito. This burrito sounds very basic but I wanted to taste their beans without a buch of other added ingredients. The burrito was very good. It was hot, freshly made and rolled to perfection. I loaded it with the red and green salsa and it was perfect.  The beef taco de lengua and the carne asada tacos were also a good choice. The meat was tender and seansoned well. Each taco cost $2.75. Honestly I thought  they were priced a little high. Especially when they are right across the street from UNLV.  My last review is the fish taco. It was very basic. I swear it tasted like a taco with two (tiny) Van De Kamp fishsticks inserted. That taco cost $2.75 but should have been closer to $.99. I was dissapointed with this choice.  I was also a bit dissapointed that they did not give out a small side of chips and salsa while we were waiting for our meal. When I inquired about getting chips I was told that a side would cost me $3.   To sum it up, the food was pretty good but priced a little high. I wished I had passed on the fish taco. I don't think I will be revisiting."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos (served all day) and chicken burritos are delicious and filling. Simple ingredients, authentic. Wednesday is $1 chicken taco day and 3 of them fill me up!"}
{"text":"What can I tell you I had an awful experience me and my wife stopped by to get a quick bite, I ordered a fish burrito it was awful, and I asked the cashier for some chips and he looked at me like he didn't know what I was talking about he may have been high or something but anyway I'm just sharing the experience that me and my wife had. I don't think that we will be stopping there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just went to #RobertosTacoShop on lake mead and Rancho in Las Vegas, woman at drive thru put chile relleno in bag sideways, all the sauce and cheese dripped onto me! 10:16pm on 9/25!  Going to call manager tomorrow."}
{"text":"Straight up pissed me off that they charge .50 cents for you to use your credit card. It's BS no other Robertos that I've been to charges for that. Food was average they need to work some things out or I won't be back."}
{"text":"Come here quite often. Place is usually pretty clean and the staff is usually ok. I've never had a problem eating here. I usually get the rolled tacos and I love them! I grew up on this stuff in Cali and this location is no different. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Most excellent tacos, really enjoyed them. Wouldn't want anything else at 1 am after a long day of laying poolside and boozing."}
{"text":"Thank God I moved out of the area because if I had to pass this every damn day I would be obese. RTS provides a comfortable place to order up whatever the heart desires.  It prepared quickly and I have not yet had an issue where I found something any less the satisfactory. Extremely affordable it fair reminds me of my So Cal days chowing down in parking lot after a night out.  I recommend if it's breakfast time to try one of their breakfast burritos......hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"The cashier is pretty rude. She needs to change the attitude or she needs to go bye bye. It gets 2 stars only for the fact that the food is good/ok and priced right for anyone on budget."}
{"text":"The lady who took my order messed up twice. She charged me for two drinks when I wanted one. Beatriz ortiz.. She never had the nerve to say sorry to her customers. This completely unsatisfactory, and all the cooks seem to be intoxicated..."}
{"text":"Not even worth it! They cannot get an order right, always giving someone else's order or at least charging you for it. They don't even know what comes on their own items. I have never gotten what I ordered on the first try."}
{"text":"Carne asada all day. Tortillas are super fly. Load up on those sauces and them spicy veggies."}
{"text":"The service isn't that great, whenever I call the person picking up doesn't seem very friendly or proficient with English.  But, I mainly come here for the food and my go-to is the chicken chimichanga.  Sometimes I feel though that there is less chicken/filling put in here than in some other locations."}
{"text":"3.7/5  Used to frequent a lot Best friend had a bad experience with cashier not Washing hands after handling mop!!! (Eww) then saying \"what do you want\" (rude)    I just frequent different Roberts around town because the food is on point! They're breakfast burrito, Cali burrito, and CHICKEN NACHOS!!(like 3 lbs and less than 9$) and the horchata  As a brand 4/5"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot specially late at night service is fast friendly and this location is very clean"}
{"text":"For what it's worth, I go to this location about once a week for those sweet little chicken rolled tacos and I've never smelled the sewer smell.  This place is consistently great, quick and friendly.  I don't know what kind of shredded cheese they use, but I'm pretty sure they put crack in it.  Try the carne asada french fries if you're in the mood for an awesome treat!"}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito. Got an egg burrito! Food here sucks..SMH been here twice and disappointed both times. Defiantly not returning a third time!"}
{"text":"The colorado meal was very good. My husband had the tongue taco and it was delicious as well, will definitely come back to try the others."}
{"text":"I love going to Roberto's but this location always get my order wrong. This was the last time ordering from this one. The back and forth is not worth it!"}
{"text":"They have really bad service. The cashier with the uneven eyeliner was super rude. 0/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it!   I had a hard time finding this place for some reason. Didn't realized it was on the side of a night club? I think that's what it was. LOL.   When I finally found it, I thought it was a cute little place. Was pretty quiet, ordered a carne asada burrito without guac. The wait was approx. 10-15 mins? Not a long wait. Took that baby home and honestly, SO GOOD. The steak was juicy and tasted so amazing ^_^. Definitely going to be coming back more often. They open 24 hours, so if you ever have the late night munchies, this would definitely be the place to go to for something fulfilling, cheap, and delicious!!   Oh, also had an horchata here, was pretty good too. :)"}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for years. Always great food I get the carne asada burritos rolled tacos cheese quesadillas all fresh"}
{"text":"Bottom line: great tasting, fair priced Mex food from a chain restaurant   The burritos are always on point, especially the breakfast burritos. Typical wait time for the drive thru like other places. The red chile is not spicy but the green is a beast! This place always hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"Omg i love robertos carne asada fries , there the best. I always go to this robertos the employees are friendly nd always treat me with respect"}
{"text":"Craving Mexican food in Vegas? Check this place out! They have great big tacos really delicious. There nachos are fully loaded and yummy. Friendly staff a +.  The burrito is huge could feed two people.  Great thing about this place it is open 24hours and food taste fresh at any time.  Check it out after the club!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas late Friday evening.  After a long drive, I was tired and wanted to sleep.  My hubby brings back Roberto's cause its across from our resort--Carnitas, Chicken, Adobada...I woke from a dead sleep and couldn't stop saying, Oh my God!  These are amazing!  Next morning, just as delicious.  Warning--went back 2 days later...not as good.  Guess it depends on the cook who is on shift."}
{"text":"Good greasy Mexican food! The taquito's with guacamole are great! You can't beat the Carne Asada burrito - it's huge and can easily be shared.  I love that you can help yourself to cucumbers and other veggies while waiting for your food to arrive."}
{"text":"They taste sooooo good. The aside burrito was packed full and the salsa was amazing. Nice and spicy. The cucumbers were crisp and the carrots were crunchy. The horchata was old"}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss. I've been here several times; the food is always good, and that's not the issue. The issue is what makes it into your bag. If I can give one piece of advice it's to fricken check your bag, especially if you have more than one plate of food in there!  It's very frustrating to order something as big and expensive as Carne Asada nachos and receive 2 tacos, instead. That sucks. How does that even happen, if the rest of the bag had the right things?  I hate to even have to look through my things, because I feel like a dick, but now I have to."}
{"text":"Drive thru literally took thirty minutes for three cars. I felt like was a prisoner waiting for my order while trying to get back to work on time, never again."}
{"text":"How can you screw up a breakfast burrito...the eggs were dry and way too much bacon."}
{"text":"This place is turning into a joke more and more i go. Your pricing isnt cheap yet your location is tight in the amount food we pay everytime!  You would think if you buy a Carne Asada Burrito from Robertos would be a good size for the price, nope! You have a better chance with a double stuff burrito from Taco Bell! Now that are raising pricing for for over priced food for the amount you get! Its all across the board from super nachos even the rolled tacos over priced for the amout of food you get!"}
{"text":"Yes, I have an affinity towards Roberto's, and they always hit the spot! They're cheap and consistent. As for this location, I've never had a bad experience. They are extremely fast and friendly, and they always go above and beyond"}
{"text":"I'm convinced that this is the best Roberto's in town. The staff here is much friendlier than others, and get this.. they actually make your food to order which means no more second guessing if they gave me a regular carne asada burrito instead of the breakfast burrito I ordered. Other than the spectacular service, the food here just tastes slightly better, we aren't really sure why, but halfway into our burritos we turned to each other to confirm that somehow the burritos were better than the other locations.   Open 24 hours and has a drive thru. I just got lazier."}
{"text":"$2.99 bacon breakfast burritos on Tuesday!!  Although I think I prefer the Don Tor Taco on Craig to this Roberto's location, I've never driven the extra couple miles to go to that one so I guess that says something. When it comes to Roberto's, we don't deviate from our usuals very often: carne asada nachos, breakfast burritos, or the beef chimichangas.   One thing that I feel I should note; the salsas are consistent, but only to that particular location. Don't expect to get the thick salsas that are served here at a location across town.   I knock off a star for the $.50 charge to use to charge card."}
{"text":"Worst location in town. Several bad experiences here, but tonight was the worst. After ordering and not getting a total, I pulled up to the window to pay- several people came and left inside. The cashier even came to the window register at one point, and after looking at me, put money in a letter envelope and then walked away. After over 10 minutes at the window without even an acknowledgment, my lunch was over and I had to leave without any food.   At least I didn't have a chance to pay, I suppose. But definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I LOVE ROBERTO'S!!! If you want some quick Mexican food this is the place to go. They serve delicious food 24/7. Chicken-Taco-Wednesdays are the best; you can buy as many tacos as you want for $1. I also love their breakfast burritos and enchiladas."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burritos or Rolled Tacos... They're So Yummy! Yes, the Hot Sauce is Actually Spicy. Can't Beat the 24/7 Service Here Either."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Carne Asada and this really hit the spot. The meat was well seasoned and the beans were good. Only thing I have to critic was the rice it could use a little more seasoning."}
{"text":"What's up with the constant sewage smell surrounding this place?  Food is decent though.  Not as good as any other Roberto's that are inside gas stations.."}
{"text":"It's not the best nor the worst. But it will do in a pinch, since its 24 hours. It tastes better the more inebriated you are, however sober it's ok. Cheap too. I recommend the #1. Chicken. To go, with all the free, fresh garnishes and salsas you can fit in your pockets... Take some carrots for the hamsters, bunnies or tacos."}
{"text":"The employees here are friendly and get your order right.  This location is clean and big.  Roberto's has very decent fast Mexican food that is consistently yummy.  We visit here frequently and they always make me happy."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Guy Fieri triple D and I had to stop by! The food prices are really affordable and the carne asada burrito was good! I would love more seasoning Or salt."}
{"text":"Best Roberto's I've been to. Take it from a Hispanic who sees Roberto's taco shops as \"not real Mexican food\". To me Roberto's is the joint you head to after a hard night of partying. Never clean, food taste ok, and bathrooms are disgusting. But this Roberto's has completely shut my mouth. I now come here every Wednesday for their famous chicken taco night! I thought they must have just opened up because they were soooo clean organized and food was really good, but no they opened 6 years ago! I was surprised when the cashier let me know. Hope they never change! Best of Las Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite bargain Mexican place. They recently drastically raised their prices about 35g and reduced portion sizes. I saw 5 people working and it was slow. I'm not sure I will be back now that this place is expensive."}
{"text":"The family recipe tortillas are fantastic on the burritos. The chicken burritos is juicy and delicious, but the carne asada with sour cream is one of the yummiest things on this planet!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but wow.  This place impressed me.  I tried two soft shell tacos with carne asada and carnitas and one hard shell taco with shredded beef.  The tortillas were big and fluffy (with a slightly crunchy shell) and the meats were quite tasty.  Maybe a little dry for some people, but that's okay for me.  Then I \"rewarded\" myself with a Churro.  Yum.  Looks like I'll have to give this place four stars..."}
{"text":"This robertos is very small. Do not come here with a group larger than 3. There is no seating. Eating areas, floor, and bathrooms are dirty."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this location.  The food doesn't even taste the same as other locations.  Go to the Grand Montecito location.  They will provide service and better tasting food."}
{"text":"I tried calling in a phone order and was put on hold for over 30 minutes. When I got there, Alex, the owner's son had replaced the women who usually works there. Viva Nepotism! The hot sauce station is dirty and there is no manager any where to be found. The boy didn't even apologize. It's been over an hour and I'm still sitting here waiting. NO MAS!"}
{"text":"Food was great and fast even got the hook up on the free horchata refill. Service is fast good prices great place to go after getting hammered."}
{"text":"Good food but the restrooms are disgusting. The second you walk in it smells like sewer. The trash cans are Overflowing. Dirty papers everywhere and you can tell it has not been CLEANED for real in a longggggg time.  Also, the tables in the dining area are all sticky and dirty.  If I didn't already pay for my food I would not eat her."}
{"text":"The first time i had Roberto's, I was a fan. I have to say Roberto's makes me miss living in Las Vegas. Their chimichanga's are to die for, and you can't leave there without getting a fried cinnamon stick, very authentic for fast food and just down right delicious. Out of all the Mexican joint's i've been too this has to be one of my favorite."}
{"text":"I went there today because the wife was hungry. She saw a photo of Chile Colorado on the wall and decided to have that. The rice, beans , and tortillas were good but, the Chile Colorado was mostly sauce. I got 2 pieces of meat, and my wife the same. First time, last time."}
{"text":"First time I went I ordered carne asada fries but meat was tasted funny.  I didn't go back for a while but gave another shot since I'm living right by there.  This time i got diarrhea.  I'm looking at these people giving good reviews, maybe I caught bad days???"}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are more than fair. Service is excellent, red hot sauce is tasty... 5 stars"}
{"text":"Meat lacked seasoning. Bland Mex at it's best. Don't waste your time. 1 star just for being open 24 hrs"}
{"text":"I have been to a total of about 4-5 different Roberto's since I have been in Vegas. This is the 1st one I have seen with a drive thru.  So I went inside... and of course it was on a Wednesday night ($1.29) Chicken Taco day. I waited for service at the window...finally a guy who obviously doesn't normally operate the register took my order. All I ordered was 2 tacos...He took forever trying to ring it up. He had no pleasant personality what so ever.   The place has a large dining area...and I couldn't help but notice the booths by the door were all filthy and covered with food.  The lil salsa bar was filled up nicely....Didn't see any radishes though...instead they had cucumbers.  Tacos were just ok. way too much lettuce. What do you expect for $1.29 each right.  I'm good on the tacos. I need to try something else on their menu before I just totally write them off."}
{"text":"We went in for taco Wednesday and as nice as the guy taking our order was, it's so disappointing to see that this is how they make their tacos. We had sworn off this location due to the poor food quality but I talked the family into trying it again to get this. Picture of my taco posted as well..."}
{"text":"Can I say bomb.com so good and tasty made fresh 24 hours and drive thru btw it will take you awhile to order they have tons of food but more the merrier. I love it just like Alberto's in California and great prices"}
{"text":"Absoulte over priced garbage..7.00 burrito with mostly bread,meat with grissle. 3 rolled tacos,  Asada burritto no drink 13.59"}
{"text":"My typical Robertos is off of Fort Apache and Tropicana, by where I used to work.  However, now I don't work there so I needed to find a Robertos by my house.  This is my first one and it is really not as good as my old Robertos.  I ordered the cheese enchilladas.  The beans were very dry and tasted powdery.  I had never eaten beans in all my years until I went to Roberts on Fort Apache,  The also were very stingy on the cheese topping, the guys at Ft. Apache load the beans with cheese. The rice at Gibson was actually good, but the enchillada was lacking in sauciness (not sure if thats a word). I will have to continue looking for a Roberto's like up on Ft. Apache."}
{"text":"Always a great late night spot !  I tend to come here late night after a fun time drinking!  The breakfast burritos are super good and very filling! My fav though has to be the super carne asada nachos!  I have never seen a place pack on the toppings like they do! I have never been let down!"}
{"text":"Very rude customer service left me waiting at the drive-through line 10 minutes I was the only one in line so I was thinking this is going to be quick but no since it took her forever in drive-through I left the drive-through line and i walk In. she's talking with another employee I politely tell her oh you left me waiting for a long time in drive through and she says  can't you see were very busy, I was shocked that she even talked like that to a customer but besides me there was only two people in the whole place. I order my food and I go to get sauce and cucumbers and area was filthy it was so disgusting sauce and food everywhere. I don't know if it's because it was late at night around 1130 that they were tired but they are 24 Business! I probably won't go to that Roberto again"}
{"text":"Rip-off. Maybe I'm a SoCal snob when it comes to taco shop, but this was a huge let down. Guacamole was thin and watery. Carne asada fries were over $8, but there were about 20 French fries in the box and the Carne was tough and bland. Even the salsa was watered down. I guess not all Roberto's are created equal. I paid over $12 for my food and was still hungry."}
{"text":"The cashier taking orders is not friendly at all doesnt smile, has an attitude when u order or ask for anything....she didnt give us napkins with our order, nd when u ask for some she gives u two, i wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very clean place! Nice salsa bar and soda station very reasonable prices! Good food and good music lol. Love there horchata :) and there carne asada nachos :) oh yeaaaaa . Great service and fast cashier and friendly as well :) the cooks and fast and food is delicious    Deffinetly recommend this place :) for a late night lunch too"}
{"text":"Food varies in size and quality employees swear in Spanish they have lost my business I was under the impression robertos was trying to create the same food experience at all locations this place does not meet standards set by the franchise just another crappy taco shop"}
{"text":"Ate here twice got sick both times won't be back they should be shut down or downgraded worst robertos ever"}
{"text":"I will give zero if i can, horrible food, just another tex mex restaurant but cheaper, they made a lot of mistakes and they just say: i will make another one, so you have to go back to the restaurant, lose time and unfair for their mistakes, horrible service and rude."}
{"text":"My new favorite location. The Carne Assada burritos were fantastic. Very flavorful-better than I have had at any location. The tamales were rockin'.   They are open daily 8am -8pm.  Gotta hit them for the breakfast burrito.  Very clean, quick great for take out or dine in if ya can't wait.   Wednesday is .99 Chicken  Tacos!!"}
{"text":"I'm normally love Roberto's but NOT this location.  First, I was way overcharged. Second, the cashier paid no attention to what I was ordering.  Third, food was cold. Finally, some annoying cook in the back is whistling in a super high pitch making my break from work unrelaxing.  What a waste. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"Normally, I love Roberto's, but this one should be closed for good. They are rude and their store is dirty. I often eat at the one on Hualapai at Desert Inn and Fort Apache/Trop on a regular basis.  The people there are very nice and the food is good.   This Roberto's on Durango at Desert Inn is the worst I have ever been in!   The lady behind the counter (with gray hair) was extremely rude.  I called in my order, which was a combo with a drink.  After I received my food, I had to ask for my cup.  She said the drink/ice machine was down and offered my one of the drinks behind the counter.  I asked if there was ice for that, and she said no.   I asked for a refund of my drink because they could not offer me a cold drink that I paid for. She refused and was very sassy and rude about it.   I told her I was reporting her to corporate and left.   This is not the first time I have had trouble at this Robertos, including the fact they regularly mess up orders, and are always RUDE! I normally avoid this location and now will never return.  Also, as I write this review, the store just called me and hung up after I answered.  I am awaiting a return call from corporate."}
{"text":"Recently moved from California so it's safe to say I love Mexican food this place is right around the corner from my house so I decided to try it around midnight after a long night at work and I wasn't disappointed they were fast and we'll priced, will definitely be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"First of all let me say I really enjoy The Robertos Taco shops but this one made the chain look terrible... Disgustingly dirty establishment dirty floor tables salsa bar etc.. On a Thursday night? I ordered the Carne asada fries with no Pico DE Gallo nd I must say I've never been served a smaller portion of fries especially because the order is usually $10 ...come on now your a taco shop in Las Vegas people can go to a cheap buffet for $10 and eat good so please don't be lazy and skimp on the portions"}
{"text":"Foods always at least decent but god some of the people working at this location are so damn rude. Whenever I order my burrito I always ask to put some jalapeños in it, but for some reason the man taking our order insisted and refused to not put the jalapeños in my burrito. Like seriously man, is that hard to put some jalapeños in a damn burrito? Rather start an argument in the drive thru then doing a simple task."}
{"text":"This place has often steered me away from the junk food clutter you find along Boulder Highway. Roberto's Carne Asada Burrito can't be beat from around 5 bucks. Three rolled Taco with Guacamole are another favorite. If you really want to chow down plates with Spanish Rice and beans are available. Not overly greasy and very tasty. The drive thru window has been a daily drive now for months. I notice if you go to the same guy at the drive thru, put tips in his jar your Burrito tends to gets larger. If you don't tip they forget to give you salsa. Ready for the secret, Wednesdays the Chicken Tacos are 99 cents."}
{"text":"This is one of the few locations that has a drive thru, which is very convenient. It's located in a gas station, and has a small dining area inside. They are usually pretty friendly, and the order accuracy is good. The food is average, which is normal for a chain restaurant. Beats Taco Bell any day."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had. Spent $47 for 3 people at this so called \"taqueria\"  Never again. Ever"}
{"text":"10/23/16   @ 6:03 Pm. Ref#3781  I will never go back ever again to this place! Fish tacos is not good at all. Seems you're eating a grass and not enough fish and no taste whatsoeve! I bought a menudo and it's missing Hominy?  I was advise by the cashier that I have to ask for it. I told her that I'm going back to get the hominy and she called me right back and advise me that they're ran out of hominyAre you kidding me!! Just ruined our dinner!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat dollerish taco Wednesday. They all ways treat me right in the drive thru. Pretty typical American Mexican food, but they're 24hrs and close to the house"}
{"text":"I've been here often, and I'm pretty sure it's just this location that makes their food extra salty. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I eat my carne asada fries (and the beans, good god, the beans). Seriously, consider going to another place. But other than that, their other foods are good, and the place isn't that bad. The staff here can sometimes be a little cranky and eager to just get your order out of the way. The food is made fast enough though, at least. Overall, not too great, not too bad."}
{"text":"Out of all the different Roberto's in Vegas, I think this one is the best.  You walk in, the person at the register is always polite, and the restaurant is normally clean.  But who cares if a restaurant is clean if the food isn't good, right? Luckily, this Roberto's is always spot on with everything they make. From the California Burrito to the Carne Asada Fries, all the way to their Fish Tacos -- it always tastes great.  If you want a good burrito, this Roberto's won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"This place made me sick... Literally! I was throwing up and had diarea for 2 days.  The interior could use a good cleaning and the service came with a healthy dose of \"bad attitude\"!  At least the prices were cheap-but you get what you pay for. Skip this place, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"3am carne asada fries! Go mop up the booze that's flooding your digestive tract."}
{"text":"OMG NOT..  I had never been to a Robert's before Friday.  I saw some of the food because my co-workers eat here on occasions.. I decided to try it out.  I stopped by and ordered a burrito.  What the menu said and what I got was so different AND not in a good way.. The beef in the Carnitas was disgusting.   DRY as a bone, so dry that it cut the inside of my mouth.  I think they deep fry their beef??? it was dripping in oil from the tortilla, and had NO season.. I was so sick afterwards.. Oh and I advise you to NOT go near the salsa Bar..  Ewwww  nasty.  They have a sign saying Please help us keep our salsa bar clean.. Well it was disgusting, dirty and near empty.. looked someone took a bath, or washed their hands in each of the condiments.. Also they have an outlet that has NO cover on it, with WIRES sticking straight out of the wall, waiting for a child to get electrocuted.. This was the WORSE burrito I have EVER eaten in my life,, Truth!!!!"}
{"text":"This place fucking sucks. Every time I come here something is wrong. The last time they messed up my order 3 time before they got it right. Mind you I had to keep coming back and forth at my own expense. Mind you it wasn't even my food it was my managers.  Now today I'm made a phone order 35 mins ago! I placed it in advance because I was play a big order for my company. I get here an there's not even a ticket ready or an order. I even called a agin to add extra tacos to the order the order and nothing was done. This is the last time I will be getting any thing from here ever again. There literally was wasting my time and money. I literally have clients waiting for a lunch this is not good for business. And mind you this is the only one out of all of there chains that I have a problem with. I've been eating at other locations for many years. Great food , horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Roberto's meat is bland as fuck at several locations...  I just go to PePe's...  They are a lot better."}
{"text":"To say I'm pissed is an understatement. First of all, I walk in and ask if they have pastor and the cashier laughs and says \"yeah, adobada\". Already I'm uncomfortable for being laughed at, but I proceed to order two adobada burritos with a side of sour cream for each. I get my order, walk out to my car and check for the sides of sour cream which were not in the bag. I go back inside with my burritos and receipt and ask the cooks for my 2 sides of sour cream, they dish it up, and up walks the cashier girl who laughed at me. I tell her the sour cream wasn't in the bag and she tells me \"they're inside the burritos\" and I respond \"well I asked for them on the side\"... but she ignores me and walks away. I stand at the register for another minute and the cooks blatantly ignore my presence, and don't give me the side containers of sour cream even though they got them ready for me. When I got home and ate my burrito I was even more disappointed. I paid $4.40 for the sour cream and there's nothing inside... nothing but grease. I ate the entire thing out of pure starvation with a big surprise at the end... still no sour cream. My boyfriend got the exact same thing as me and he had no sour cream inside either, but his burrito was less greasy than mine. Forget this place, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"So this was one of our (Me & Hubby) favorite places to eat, until... One early morning we came to get some breakfast burritos that we thought would be delicious but were sadly mistaken. Instead we found long strands of hair throughout the burritos! How gross and we knew it was the cooks cuz he had a long ponytail WITHOUT a hairnet and our hair isn't the same type or length. Most of the Roberto's out here aren't the cleanest but you could still expect the food to be good. However this incident and bad customer service every time we went to a Roberto's has just turned us off completely."}
{"text":"3 cars deep.... 1130, on a wednesday. While it isn't the fanciest, it's actually better food than I have had most places that are a \"real\" sit down restaruant.  Ordered the carnitas tacos, and a fish taco. Carnitas were a little crunchy on the outside. The fish taco had too much cabbage on top for me... But over all, no complaints. Their breakfast burritos are quite good, and filling. You will only need one of those, and then a nap."}
{"text":"This locale...Cali burrito..No bueno. Carne asada lacked flavor. I had hi hopes because it's closest to home. But with all the different locales good tasting dishes can be hit or miss. I'm not giving up on Roberto's. Just won't go to this one."}
{"text":"Roberto's has been a favorite of ours for 15 years. We used to go in San Diego and this location meets the same standards as what we had there. I always love the cheese enchiladas and my husband likes the carne asada burritos. You really can't go wrong. Breakfast is good as well. The carne asada fries are massive. The restaurant is pretty clean and a good location."}
{"text":"They gave me chicken instead of beef, but its ok it was actually pretty damn tasty. Shredded chicken with onions, tomatoes and green peppers.  I come here often so, yea ill be back."}
{"text":"Crispy Chicken tacos was a must on Wednesday since they are only $1. A nice quick fix for crunch and they put plenty of meat in each taco. With lettuce and cheese this is a taco fix that you won't want to miss! Their green sauce is a must have along with a fresh bar of red sauce, cucumber, radish and green onion, great additions!"}
{"text":"I ordered a beef burrito and my fiancé ordered a carnitas burrito. What we got was two carnitas burritos and the staff said they would not return it and make me what I ordered. I showed them the mistake they had made in the form of a  carnitas burrito and then I was told that I don't know the difference between pork and beef. Very disappointing service I will never return."}
{"text":"The BEST Roberto's in town!! We always bounce between our favorite of Roberto's menu items: Carne Asada Burrito, their Bacon Breakfast burrito, Carne Asada Fries (or Carne Asada Nachos) or their 3 rolled tacos, (which come LOADED with guacamole, cheese and sour cream) My husband and I always split a burrito between the 2 of us because their portion sizes are HUGE!  We had to get Roberto's once from another location once because we weren't near this one, and the carne asada burrito we ordered was about HALF the size of the ones they make at this location, so we vowed to always do business with this one!   The cooks are always friendly and liberal. I'm starting to think that they know we are repeat customers.... We seriously have Roberto's about twice a week. And you should too!   The staff is friendly, the location is clean and spacious, and the salsa bar is always freshly supplied and clean.  We've never had an issue with waiting too long, but then again we usually have (nay, CRAVE) Roberto's either early in the morning or late in the evening. And the fact that they are 24 hours is ALWAYS a plus. Whether you call your order in or place it when you're there, the wait is never more than about 10 minutes.   Definitely a favorite food place of ours! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I ordered postmates twice in a row. They dont read here.  I ask specifically for extra crispy fries, meat well done and extra pico.  They bring me undercooked wet mushy fries, wet beef and no pico. 2x in a row you! Threw it away both times"}
{"text":"This location has to be the worst in Vegas! I sat at the drive thru me and 3 other cars at a complete stop for 25 mins. I only stayed just to see how long it would take for one car to leave. The lady that works the night shift has a nasty attitude. As I approach the window my son had not decided on what he wanted so I asked the lady to pls give me a min. Then she just let us sit there. After calling for her three times she finally answers and tells me didn't you say give you a min. Yes I did but not 10 jeez! As I placed my order I requested that there is no salsa or pico on any of the orders. Well I receive my food and like always it has pico all over every item! I think she deliberately didn't put it because I asked for a min. But I've just about had it. A entire 45 mins for an order through drive thru is ridiculous! One more thing their food is always....overly salted!!!"}
{"text":"I frequently visit this robertos about twice a week and I happened to come real late on a friday night while they were pretty busy.. Not very often they get my order wrong, but the one time they did, they gave me more than what I asked for. :-) I hate for them to have lost out on product and have them re make my order without the extras but I haven't eaten all day and I just came back from the gym. The crew is super nice and hooked me up pronto! Thanks guys you're the best. 5 Stars all day long."}
{"text":"So, I am right here infront of this location while doing this review. I just dont know why it says 24 hours when once I walked inside, the employees told me they're close. Is it really that hard to put a sign that the store is closed for the night or how hard it is to lock the entrance door? This location is getting worst; I had 3 of my orders from different times that they messed up. And employees here dont know how to smile. Geez, it's late night! You dont even have lots of customers! Please give a smile when a customer walks in!"}
{"text":"Yumm is all I got to say! Quick and tasty somewhat authentic!"}
{"text":"This particular Roberto's was on my way to work, and I know they usually take long no matter what you order.  So I Yelped it to get the number to place a phone order for pick up. (Thanks Yelp!)  The lady answered the phone, \"Roverto's.\" I ask, \"Yeah, is this the one next to the gas station on Cheyenne and Martin Luther King?\" she replies, \"escu me?\" and goes off speaking machine gun spanish and hands the phone to a gentlemen who speaks slightly better English.  I find out it really is the one on Cheyenne and MLK and place my order of a Carne asada burrito.  I get there and tell them I just called for a Carne asada burrito and they just now make it.  What was the point of even calling in the order?  3 stars for the burrito still being glorious."}
{"text":"Best Roberto's !!! Clean! Great service and food!!! All Of them should be like this establishment...the one one on Cactus and Bermuda sucks but this location is amazing!"}
{"text":"My last time ...I keep going back because I grew up with Roberto's and I love it HOWEVER the one by my house is terrible!  They are never consistent with their food orders being correct or the food quality and the customer service is awful!!!!!  I went to the drive-through and as I'm checking my order the lady tells me I need to move up because she has other customers ....excuse me?! Well maybe if you didn't get my order wrong almost every time I wouldn't have to sit here and check to see if my order is right! I should have known since she was immediately rude when I pulled up to the window....  no thank you...I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This particular Roberto's Taco Shop is the worst Roberto's we have ever been to.  On both occasions there seemed to be a lack of adult management. We ordered three dinners on the first visit and we all were disappointed compared to our experience at other Roberto's in Las Vegas. On my second visit I ordered the breakfast burrito. The chunks of potato were cold, it was too dry to eat and all the cheese was clumped in one end of the burrito. I tossed it. Save your money and go to Rachel's Kitchen in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"I came and when I was orderin the cashier wasnt paying attention so I had to repeat my order 4 times until she got it. I ordered an asada torta for me and an order of flautas for my daughter and I ask the cashier to put lettuce and sour cream but not cheesse, and she said the flautas did not come with nothing else but the flautas themself and that I was going to be charged if I wanted lettuce and sourcream. WTH.  Plus my torta was burned! ."}
{"text":"I see Roberto's Taco Shop locations aren't that highly reviewed on Yelp. I've been to a couple, they were fine. I always go to this one after gambling and drinking at Sam's Town. They rock. I generally get super nachos and rolled tacos and they hit the spot. Plenty of meat and cheese. Friendly customer service and quick."}
{"text":"We are ten cars deep in the drive through and after waiting almost an hour this is what I see. The staff on their phones  just \" hanging out\""}
{"text":"My go to place for Mexican fast food. Wish I could rate Robertos a 4.5. My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito. Also get Taco Salad, Carnita'S Burrito and the Tostada. It's a hole in the wall inside and I love that."}
{"text":"I grab food from this location and I have to say that it is always clean and fast.  I love the breakfast burrito's."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really quiet when I went in yesterday--I thought it was strange that there wasn't any music playing, but it's not necessary.  The guys working there were attentive and friendly. I loved the menu with pictures on it! I wish all restaurants had those. The food came out VERY quickly. I had cheese enchiladas, refried beans and rice for $6. Not bad at all!  I would kill for some Tex-Mex and will continue hunting for the best Mexican food in this city, but for now, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this gem while perusing the streets of Vegas for a some good Mexican food. I happened to remember hearing decent things about Roberto's so I figured why not try it out.   Let me tell you that appearances aren't what they seem. When we pulled into this restaurant off S. Decatur, I briefly rethought my suggestion. It looked a little rundown and that made me a bit nervous. I figured we were already there, though, so might as well make the best of it. I am so glad we stayed!   The food is amazing! I got a taco and enchilada while my husband got a burrito and enchilada. I was blown away at how good it was! My husband particularly enjoyed the pepper and salsa station with a variety of both. By the time we left we were stuffed.   On top of the great food was the amazing service. The guy that took our order was courteous and even helped bring our food to the table as my hands were already full.   Overall a great place to grab some great Mexican grub!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and they are open 24 hours. The carne asada and adobada tacos or burritos are my favorites. I think the chicken taco is just ok."}
{"text":"Who can like a Mexican place that doesn't melt the cheese on nachos?!!  Beef is chewy and gristly. I've given them so many chances but their food is just awful."}
{"text":"This location sucks.  They can never get the order right and half the time the girls at the register are so rude.  There was one time they started cooking my food before I even finished my order and they misunderstood what I asked for and cooked something different and said I had to still buy it.  Wtf?  I let that pass because it could have been an honest mistake but this time when I went to go order the same exact thing, they still messed up."}
{"text":"Lots of food. Great price! Everyone was friendly. Very clean inside . We will definitely be going back. Robertos also has excellent breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This place is so dirty I honestly can't believe the way the station where you get your sauces/lemons/etc is. Came in here during my lunch break and the cashier didn't ask me if I was taking it to go or not. So they did my order as if I was eating here. Second the back station for the sauces was gross. There was no green sauce left and all the lemons were thrown on top of the sauce everything was basically not where it's supposed to be drenched in all the sauces. Not to mention I stepped on an old onion that was left on the ground along with lemons and napkins. Like I've been to so many robertos and this by far is the dirtiest one. Management needs to do a better job at keeping the restaurant sanitary."}
{"text":"Love that this place is in the heart of summerlin and has a drive thru seriously so convenient. The food is always correct and good but the only complaint I will have is that the male employees do not act very friendly. Their attitude is the \"I hate my job\" but the female workers have always been good with a positive attitude."}
{"text":"Made me wait 20 minutes for 4 tacos because hey decided to do their preps before I had to knock on the window to get someone to make my tacos then I got cussed out"}
{"text":"If you consider going to this place through the drive-thru , make sure that you open up every item and look in it thoroughly.  I stopped by per a request and order some carne asada fries , no pico, no sour cream , guacamole on the side. Well I get home and what do I get ??? Extra sour cream no guacamole !!! OK so what right????....well this was the peak of the iceberg.  The time before that I again stopped at this location and bought a shrimp cocktail.  Came home and what do I find....only 4 shrimps in my so called shrimp cocktail!!!! I called the manager right away and apologized for my frustration and told her that this was just simply not acceptable service. She said that if I had my receipt and brought in the item back then they will be able to replace it. I explained to her that the reason why I went to the drive thru was to come home , and how it would be an inconvenience to me. Her answer , well there's nothing for us to do then. Really???? Not an apology, no I will take care of this for you....NOTHING! !! Way to show your customer service. A truly waste of time. Never again."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible! I should have known that this place wasn't authentic right at the moment when I had to ASK if they sell soft tacos. We tried alot: the tacos, burrito, the taco salad. They all taste like they were made with a sprinkle of depression on top. I should have followed my gut feeling. Btw, the refried beans here are straight sad and the tacos at Jack in the Box taste better!"}
{"text":"Usually love Roberto's.  Had some chicken tacos yesterday. The first 2 I grabbed out of bag were not hot or even warm.   I regret eating them and now have abdominal pain.   Place is dirty and has dirtbags behind the counter. I'll never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food here - simple, fresh, great prices and very good.  I would definitely come back again.  Got the rolled tacos platter and like how they topped it off with good amount of guacamole and lettuce.  The salsa/sauce bar is also great and I liked the spicy/pickled carrots.  Now I want to come back to try the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Top notch taco chain! I opted for the California Burrito and was not disappointed - this beast had french fries, steak, cheese, and everything else that dreams are made of.   My girlfriend ordered the sour cream rolled tacos, which were basically delicious, fresh taquitos. The sour cream it came with was so huge that I ended up stealing a bunch to dip my burrito into which increased the fast food induced moans I was making by 50%.  I'll definitely be stopping back again when I'm on the west coast to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Now this is the burrito place. Breakfast burrito was choice, spicy carrots were top notch, and the environment was simple and easy going. A Mexican place like the stuff of dreams. Thanks, Roberto's!"}
{"text":"So I have been to a couple of Roberto's since moving here and this one is the BEST!  Their prices are good and the bean and cheese burritos are SOOOO good. and they are huge! great price for 2.50 by BF loves the carne asada fries and the taquitos are yummy too."}
{"text":"Such a great find. Such great tacos. The pastor ruled everything. I happened upon it while checking out the overpriced Moondog Records next door. Will go back just for the tacos."}
{"text":"Worst one in town. I ordered  12 tacos. Only got 5. This is bullshit. Bitch at the counter was rude too"}
{"text":"The cleanest roberto's in town. Best place to sober up and eat some carne asada fry's which is one of there best on the menu.  They are sometime's fast with there order's and sometime's they can take an extra mintue.  But; overall delicious."}
{"text":"Had to go back for late night snack.  As everyone will say, they are friendly and if you become a regular, they will know how you like your food."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos, beef and chicken tacos. The service is consistently good-friendly employees"}
{"text":"If you want good, inexpensive Mexican food 24 hours a day..this is the place to get it! I've been to several locations out here in Vegas and I will keep going back! The Carne Asada tacos are awesome and so are the breakfast burritos..they don't skimp on ingredients here! My husband and I ate there for under $10..eat at Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Use to Love coming here whenever I was in Vegas as they had the best Guacamole. Pure avocado with no water down fillers. Now it tastes like the frozen guacamole and they puréed it to it's almost liquid. The rest of the meal is fine for fast food. But don't think I will go out my way to have it. If I'm staying at Sams Town I may get a taco just tie me to dinner."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area and this was our go-to spot for cheap Mexican food. No lie, the area is a bit rough... really the plaza itself adds to that. It has never smelled great in here, but the wet bleach mop smell was especially pungent today.   Very disappointed to find the place has only gotten worse. I ordered my usual: a carne asada burrito with guac and pico, the special, but without guac or pico, and lettuce and cheese instead. For the first time, I was charged $1.10 to add cheese. I questioned this, as this (and every other Roberto's) location has never charged me for the lesser valued cheese given I remove the more costly guac. Later I ask for a refill on my drink, suddenly it costs a dollar?   I frequent this chain enough to know this isn't normal, nor does this policy enhance the customer experience. Food was okay, nothing special. I recommend you avoid this location."}
{"text":"It's average Mexican food served very quickly.  Roberto's is designed to rush Mexican food out as quickly as possible.  It's still pretty good and pretty cheap despite how fast it gets made.  My usual complaint from this place is that it's rushed out so much that often I get meals with cheese that isn't melted when it should be.  For example, if I buy nachos, I would normally expect the cheese to be melted, but it never is.  Instead I get cold cheese on some chips with beans, meat and other stuff.  I do like the flavor of their Carne Asada.  It can be Asada nachos, or an Asada plate, does not matter it tastes very good.  I haven't gotten to adventurous so Ive only ordered the chicken tacos, chicken enchiladas, Asada Nachos, Asada Burrito, and cheese enchiladas.  Everything was pretty good, but not too special.  Basically exactly what I expect from this type of place."}
{"text":"I pass this place twice a day and finally tried their tacos. They were meaty and filling. The meat was seasoned perfectly. I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come through here, the staff is always awesome!  Friendly and welcoming!  Food is on point too!"}
{"text":"I'm am mexican, and oh my god, the worst mexican food ever, but apparently gringos love this crap! To bad that people think that this place is good!  This place is discarding and the owner go lucky to be successful in this contry with this piss of shit food! If Roberts taco was in my contry,  believe me it would go close long time ago!  Keep eating nasty food from Robertos taco gringos!  You don't have any idea what is a real mexican food!"}
{"text":"Good option for drunchie meals, but i've had better mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good food. The staff is always nice and the restraunt is clean. I love the rolled tacos with rice and beans. They are open 24/7"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Roberto's in Vegas! I've been to plenty of Roberto's in LV and nothing compares to this one! Usually go at late at night (10-12), the cashier and the cooks are amazing, and very friendly! I mean I've been to the Roberto's on LV BLVD were they literally get the meat out of a pan dump it onto the grill for 30 seconds and assume that it's warm enough to serve it to you! All you get is soggy friends and cold meat but not here this place really takes the trophy for the best in my personal opinion! I'm assuming since the employees here are awesome they probably get a decent pay but honestly they should get a raise because not all Roberto's are as welcoming as this one! Let's not get started with customer service and the restaurant it's self always well maintained!"}
{"text":"The cooks get a 5 star but the cashier and one lady cook gets negative stars!!!  First time I came here I got the burrito combo with rice and beans I asked the bull nose piercing girl if she can add the rice and beans to my burrito and she said yes for 5$ more! I mean she must think I'm and idiot of some sort but I come to Robertos all the time and different locations and I've never had a problem until I came here.  I starting coming to this location because it's close to work so I decided to call and order over the phone and the girl hung up on me! I called again and she said to call back in 10 minutes because she was mixing the salsas which makes 0 sense so she hangs up on me again! I called her back and I told her you know what what's the point of having a phone if you're going to hang up on your customers I'm going on my lunch and I need my food ready to pick up in 15 minutes. I was speaking English the whole time so when I show up The restaurant some humongous lady like tall like a giraffe says in Spanish \" Esa es la pinche perra que estaba marcando! \" the girl with the nose piercing asked if I had called and I said yes and she tells the girls in the back yes it was her and they proceed to call me a B' and other names as if I couldn't understand! They made my lengua burrito horrible I wish I had pictures to show, it was practically a taco with a hand load of onion. I asked for a manager she said they're only there in the morning. I said ok and by the way tell your lovely coworker that if she has a issue with her job maybe she should find something she likes and have her stop taking out her anger on customers and let her know I speak Spanish too! The cashier didn't say one word  After this incident I was really upset and trying to reach a manager and no one knows who the manager is apparently these people just hire themselves and don't know who pays them. I still come back to this location from time to time only at night when the guys are there they seem to be the only ones who are respectful and have great customer service.   So I come back a few weeks later and the cashier with the bull ring on her nose was there. She hates speaking Spanish and works at a MEXICAN restaurant and talks a bunch of b.s with the Mexican cooks, makes no sense anyways I ordered two shredded tostadas with sour cream. Take in mind they cost 2.75 each and she's trying to charge $10 and some change because BEANS AND SOUR CREAM are extra. I asked her why are you charging me almost 11$ when it should be about 6/7 she said because beans and sour cream are extra I said well I hope I'm getting a whole casserole of beans and sour cream for that price! She INSISTED that the menu above her was incorrect and that the paper one was right! I told her \" no! if you're Mexican you know a tostada comes with beans!! \" no questions asked  she said \" Oh I'll take off that charge for you! \" Mmm of course you are because a tostada comes with beans you silly goose don't try to act as if you're doing me a favor!!! I then told her well maybe a manager needs to know so they can fix the menu above you since it's incorrect she of coursed ignored and charged me my food and went to the corner to text on her phone. I told her there was no salsa verde and she keep texting and ignored me didn't even acknowledge me with an ok. She later came out with a bucket of salsa dumped it, left the mess there and went back to texting as if everything was ok! I work with customers 40 + hrs a week and let me tell you as irritating and annoying some people can be you always have to maintain calm! If I cussed her out or was rude I would sincerely understand there comments and facial expressions but seriously this happens 50% of the time and not just with me with my co workers as well who go there 3/7 days of the week!"}
{"text":"ew.  I love roberto's.. but this particular location was a hot mess.  it could've been because we were there after a long night of gambling and it was pretty late..  but, it doesn't matter what time it is.  if your a 24 hour joint.. u better make sure it looks the way it did when u first opened!  let me paint a mental picture of my first impression: the first thing u see when u walk in is the the salsa bar which looked like it hadn't been replenished in 30 years.  the tables looked unkept.. and there was no employee in sight.   we walked in pretty buzzed and really hungry.. so you could definitely hear us come in.  we didn't come in with ninja footsteps.  [it was a good night of gambling with friends.. so 'spirits' were high. literally.] we tried not to be so annoying  and brought it down a little for the 4 patrons eating their food when we walked in. [teenagers mind u, I'm sure they didn't mind us knuckleheads.]  so while we waited for someone to come out and help us,  we took the opportunity to scope the menu.. even though we knew what we wanted and knew the menu.  the point is, no one was there to help us... so we had time.  it took forever for this kat to come out!  the f'd up part was we could kinda see him in a back room visible from the counter, sitting on a chair.  we had to hoot and hollar for him to help us.. [another minute and I was about to go and see if I could help him!]  but alas, he finally comes to and takes our order without apologizing for the wait.  boo.  1/2 star for: DRIVE THRU.  [and it only gets half because we waited for our food outside, and watched a car waiting to take an order for about 10 to 15 minutes.  i don't know if the speaker was off... or the man inside went to sit back down.. but, really?   [if I were waiting that long I would've gotten out of my car while it was still parked in the drive thru.  it's better off as a parking space..]  anyway.... I will not return to this particular location.  thank goodness this is not my neighborhood roberto's because it sucks!"}
{"text":"We come here very often.  There are other Robertos but the taste is different.  I always get the shrimp burrito, it comes with rice inside and a little kick in the spicy department. Their horchata I do have to admit it's not very good.  The location is convenient to where we live so it's another plus."}
{"text":"The food is very bad. It looks and tastes so cheap. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito, but now....I would rather eat cardboard because I can probably get a little more flavor out of it!! Burrito was so BLAND!!! No TASTE! NO seasonings whatsoever.  You have to season meat with at least salt n pepper...geez this meat tasted like....Nothing! Even the potatoes were plain.  Never again. I will look for a place that have Taste."}
{"text":"Thank you Gerardo R. for your racist rant! It's funny cuz most of the Mexicans I work with love this place. But, in my opinion I think this place is decent but not great. It's fast food."}
{"text":"Mexican fast food, but the food is much better than you would expect. Staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Called Del Torta Mexican Grill now.    My local spot for yummy CA burritos, carne asada fries/nachos, and tacos! I've never actually eaten inside, but when I do come in  to pick up my take out orders it always seems clean.  They are very polite on the phone and always make sure that I know where I'm ordering....  And they are SOOOO quick.  The menu offers a lot of good stuff... that I have yet to try because Mexican food is one of my faves!!! BUT... I always result to my CA carne asada burrito w/ extra avocado... OR my carne asada fries/ or nachos... whichever i feel like.. and occasionally I'll order Carne Asada tacos... or Chicken tacos.  I'm never unsatisfied or turned off by the food.  It's always yummy!"}
{"text":"The best California Burrito I have ever had from any Roberto's (even though they are delicious at every location I visit!) Fast, clean, and efficient!"}
{"text":"I like Robertos Taco off of lake mead better than this one.  I normally get the shrimp burritos, the shrimp burrito here is like half the size of the other Robertos."}
{"text":"Ni una estrella merecen estos señores. Compre 6 tacos de asada con pico de gallo.  3 de asada y pedí sólo tomate y cilantro. No cebolla. Y me cobraron $2.40 por el tomate y 2.25 por el cilantro. No les da vergüenza. Sólo porque no quería cebolla. Y entonces porque no me cobraron x el pico de gallo? Acaso no saben que la libra de tomate esta a $0.99.  Pedí un vaso para hielo y el señor dijo q tenia q comprar una soda. Sabiendo que compre un gatorade y dos pepsi de botella. En que cabeza esta el mal servicio que brindan. En mi empresa dijimos que nunca más volveremos a ese sitio. $40 dólares por mal servicio y sin aderezos. Que tacos tan costosos."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Roberto's I've ever been to in Vegas. The workers are polite, bathrooms and seating areas, and condiment section is always clean. Everything is always SO bomb. The cooks know exactly what they're doing."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting and their menudo is the worst save your money and go somewhere else,places like this give Mexican food a bad name and experience to people that do not know what real Mexican food tastes like ,"}
{"text":"Years later, James O., a self-proclaimed fan of Roberto's, convinced me to give it another try. Unfortunately, it was just as I remembered...ick. I think one of the biggest issues here is lack of flavor. Hint: Be sure to ask for both red and green sauce, and extra of each. You've got to smother the meat in the sauces to make it even edible. The carne asada nachos and fries are great in theory, and they don't lack for toppings (but more cheese would certainly be appreciated) - but they totally lack flavor. The taco shells are too greasy and have just a small pinch of meat in them. Where's the beef? Even James O. said he didn't like the tacos this time around. So perhaps the culprit is this particular location? Or perhaps James O. only actually likes Roberto's when he's really drunk and/or hungover? Bottom line: This is not where I will be purchasing my tacos."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shops have very authentic and tasty Mexican food...awesome frijoles, delicious shredded chicken tacos, rolled tacos, decent spanish rice, and so much more! Open 24 hours and they usually offer a great chicken taco deal on Wednesdays...99 cents each!"}
{"text":"We frequent this Roberto's several times a month.  Some of the reviews have this location confused with other locations.  This one does not have a drive thru.  We appreciate that they serve shredded beef.   The customer service has always been good.  We call ahead for take out and they follow through correctly and the food is consistent..  Having tried some of the other locations, this is our favorite as the food flavors are not consistent from store to store.  We favor the shredded beef taco plate and the shredded beef nachos.  Our best Mexican food quick stop in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and the drive through worker was moving so fast she gave me the incorrect change. I went back and explained to them that they had shorted me $10 and all the manager/owner could say was its my responsibility to get the right amount. I was driving so I didn't count the change plus there was a long line behind me. They obviously don't care about their customers here."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service . Not friendly and their description of the spice level of the food are inaccurate . I asked specifically if the food was spicy and the woman said no and it was extremely spice to the point I couldn't eat it . And when I went back to say something she was rude"}
{"text":"Its inexpensive, its open 24 hours and its actually real food not a processed frozen patty!  California burrito is awesome steak fries and cheddar cheese!  Salsa bar is always on point free cucumber lemons and red/ green salsa and the pickled carrots   i gues everyone has time to complain but never to give a good review"}
{"text":"I was eating yesterday at ur restaurant when saw one of you employees was taking orders at the cashier with gloves  on and then went back to the kitchen with the same gloves. he took orders grab the meet and start cooking    Thats a health code violation      I wound never go back to eat there. Eeewwww. Jones/warms springs"}
{"text":"Great place to stop anytime day or night, especially night. If you need a quick fix in the AM. Great carne asada... anything, fries, burrito, tacos, taco salad."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, the food is not good.  Taco bell or Del taco has better and cheaper food."}
{"text":"One word:. Greasy. There must have been a pint of oil in all our food.  A quesadilla is a plain tortilla grilled, and then cheese/filings are added.  Apparently, someone never cleaned the grill, as the tortilla was imbibed with oil (not oil from the cheese).  Other food was similar."}
{"text":"I want to take this Taco Shop home with me.   This is the first Mexican place I've been to where they had a little \"hot sauce\" bar. Sort of like a salad bar for hot sauces, veggies for your tacos, and those awesome jalapenos, onions & carrots.  I had the steak taco, torta, & chimichanga...all top notch delicious! They didn't skip a beat in the way they marinated their meat, the pico de gallo they added and all the extra toppings.   Plus, they're open 24 hours and have a drive thru.   Love you Roberto."}
{"text":"I ordered my food and took it home to find that they messed up my order. I drove back to have it corrected. After I got home and started eating my food I found a hair with a follicle attached. I returned again only to be accused of putting it there myself. I have very long curly hair (I'm bi-racial) and the hair in my food was an inch long, black, and straight. The food wasn't worth the gas that I used to drive there 3 times, only to be accused, very loudly, of sabotaging my food because I wanted it for free. I was so disgusted with the horrible service."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but good for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Worst Robertos I've eaten at. Terrible carne asada. Thought third time would be a charm but I was wrong. Still terrible. Sad because it's so close."}
{"text":"One of the biggest things I have missed since moving to Scottsdale.  Roberto's has plenty of locations in Vegas, but this one is easily the best.  The food is always fresh and good.  Staff is on top of things.  Was even better it was five minutes from my house.  I have been to plenty of these in town and this is in my top two (Rainbow and Vegas) is also pretty solid."}
{"text":"Went for a breakfast burrito the potatoes were all hard and nasty this place use to be much better"}
{"text":"I believe that this is the first location of Roberto's in town, although I may be wrong, but it is one of the first.  The building looks like nothing much from the outside, but it is always packed.  They have a drive-thru, but it can take a very long time to get your order.  They have a good selection and speak a lot of English at this location.  They are very quick in service and have nice specials.  They just don't have a shrimp burrito like some other locations.  They also have one parking spot, in front of the building, since most customers come from the MAX.  Expect to see some military personnel from the AFB and I'm sure there are lots of customers on the weekend from the adjacent swap meet.  I also found it interesting that this location has some arcade games and a jukebox."}
{"text":"Vegas folks love their fast food Mexican and Roberto's are always a decent stop for a breakfast burrito or carne asada burrito.  Keep your taqueria demands simple and Roberto's is a solid choice.  This Roberto's location is clean, quick, and offers a tasty breakfast burrito.  Solid tomatillo sauce as well.  Not the best in town, but worth a stop if heading home after the bar or needing a morning burrito with pico."}
{"text":"Ordered the California burrito, it lacked flavor and as a whole was not good. The only thing pleasant about this burrito was the hot sauce. Never going here again"}
{"text":"Bad service no manger around to take care of the situation, reason why is that cashier took my order did not wash her hands shoved them in the chips for the carne asãda fries with her bear hands and then Denied after I watched her prepare my food and then tried arguing with me about it so at least she refunded my money not coming back to this place ever again !!sucks that I made this place my #1 for fast Mexican food"}
{"text":"What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:  1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.  2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking versus using decor to convince you that things are better than they are in reality."}
{"text":"Aside from their friendly staff and quick service, they are hands down with their nachos carnitas! It kinda reminds me of kalua pork from Hawaii! I'm glad that this location is open 24/7! Keep up the awesome work guys!"}
{"text":"I had the #5 beef burrito combo. The burrito was good. Everyrhing else was average. Service seemed fine and place seemed clean enough. I would stop in again if close by."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the others. The workers are not friendly and the breakfast burritos seem to only be half full..."}
{"text":"Smallest shrimp cocktail I've ever got from a Roberto's shop. When being questioned about the size, he said it'd cost $15-17 for a bigger size??! Tastes the same but def won't come back here."}
{"text":"What can I say?  If you live in Vegas and you have ever been on a bender, this is where you head afterward.  Okay, you don't have to be drinking to appreciate the food, but you probably won't be able to finish it otherwise.  Friendly staff, quick service, food is fantastic!  I love the tacos but I love love the carne asada fries.  It's like my favorite meat, my favorite vegetable and my favorite dairy products all got married."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for a 24-hr mex pickup place. Not much room for seating and wouldn't really suggest it. Never had a bad meal here, the carne asada tacos and burritos are a safe play, add a lime or hot sauce and you are set. Not much to add about rice and beans which are standard. My buddy gets the chicken chimichanga every time, I haven't deviated from the steak too often."}
{"text":"Gawd damn.  Love.  Used to hate Robertos.  Every time Ive been there years prior my friends would be like 'omg these chicken tacos.' Lemme tell you something.  The chicken tacos are shit.  If you want to pay 1.29 or 0.99 on Wednesdays for some boiled unseasoned meat inside an obviously fried because its expiring tortilla then you, not my friend, have the taste buds of a  Frogger that finds car bumpers tasty.  Chicken tacos here are nasty.  My wicked hangover, thanks to a gal working at Cheetahs named Cindy that was really a working gal but wasnt but was,  led me here one early Sunday morning.    F no I didnt order no chicken taco bs.  I ordered a chicken enchilada combo which came with 1 nastifuk chicken taco and an adoboda taco.  Or was it adobaba.  Or was it abodaba?  I dont know I said said gimme an abracadabra taco or whatever you call it.  The abracadabra taco is carnitas but seasoned so much better so I feel sorry for you dumbnutz that dont order it.  It was bomb.  Took one bite of that shitty chicken taco and wanted to use it as toilet paper or to repair scaffolding.  Scarfed down that enchilada and glorious abracadabra taco quicker  than an asian nerd plays pokemongo or whatever it is called that gets you ganked.    Do you want to walk around collecting imaginary stuffed animals or do you want delicious tacos?  What do I know everyone is retarded these days.  I call  it Minecraft Syndrome and dont get me started on that.  Order the aboboda or whatever it is called.  Great deal and yumz."}
{"text":"Wow went there today and all i wanted was a tamale Ok so no rice and beans so fine two tamales. The guy taking our orders was an idiot. He acted like we were stupid because Im guessing English is now the second language in Vegas. Tamales weren't on the menu board. My friends order was 11.00 And mine was 6.45 for just two plain tamales. I watched him microwave them and they were SO overdone they were hard and couldn't be eaten. SKIP this Robertos Their quality sucks. My friends beans were cold and hard as well.... As I said STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"This is the second time this has happened. We ordered a burrito to go and used my debit card, today i saw that once again the charge was for EXACTLY 2.00 more than I signed for. This happened a month ago which is why I haven't gone in there but today my kid wanted a burrito.  I should file a dispute over this but I want to warn you, make sure you don't pay 10.00 for a single burrito, no extras no nothing.  Maybe we wont go back again...... I may turn this into local media as well."}
{"text":"Is it Wednesday? Yes it is and that means .99 tacos at Roberto's!! Oh yeah!!  Roberto's Tacos, originally from CA, has locations all around the Las Vegas area and they are all pretty much uniform: Good Mexican food, fast. They serve traditional Mexican fare at a very reasonable price.   Everything here is pretty good, but my favorite dish has to be the Carne Asada Nachos. I will warn you however that you may never be satisfied with any other nachos if you try these.  As someone posted earlier,  they don't do Tex Mex. They also don't have ground beef like substance or tacos within a taco.  I consider these a pro."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from LA in February and I am sooo happy to have found this place. We ave 'em in LaLa Land, too.  I really missed having some food that reminded me of home but this place fills the bill.  I HIGHLY recommend the Carne Asada fries!"}
{"text":"Wow! The carne Asada taco taste like cheap steak. I will never come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Please don't waste money here. Go to El Sabbors which is up the street from here they have good consumer service and food with flavor and better prices."}
{"text":"I concur with other yelpers, this mexican joint often open twenty four hours is such a great Las Vegas institution. Although I do attempt to make my stops in frequent it isn't because it isn't amazing!!!!! Thr rolled tacos with cheese and guac on the side is my favorite thing and the red super hot sauce will burn your mouth, but really taste good!"}
{"text":"They made the burrito wrong and they wouldn't fix it and make a new one.  They just lost a customer for life over a $6 burrito."}
{"text":"My fiance loved the food so much he made us come back again!  He ordered the carne asada fries again, no doubt in his mind that's what he wanted. I wasn't as hungry, so I ordered the 3 taquito plate (I think it's the #11) with guacamole, rice and beans.  The service was super quick and the fries, I think, were better this time round. The guacomole was really loaded on my taquitos, and the piña was delicious (as well as the tamarindo). The only thing that sucked was that I thought since ordering a combo, it would come with a drink. Looked at the receipt and they charged it extra, so I went up and asked and they said the combo didn't come with a drink. Shucks :(  Everything we got was super tasty, and we'd love to come back before our trip is over...I know my fiance is dying for those fries again, already!"}
{"text":"I have been craving some Mexican food, and since it's been a while that I had a good sh%*. I stopped here and order a carne asada burrito with rice and beans. They serve a lot of food and it was very cheap. After eating half of the burrito I was able to fix my back up issue. Boy I was happy, after I got done eating. Next time I will try the carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"Went in sunday morning about 9am... as I tried to order my food in the drive thru all I kept hearing was the girl laughing over and over and I had to repeat my order for times.... when I finally got my order I drove home and everything was completely wrong she charged me for extra guacamole and didn't even put it on my tacos or on the side I asked her for corn tortillas and she gave me flower and the menudo was super cold when I opened it I've been a customer for over 20 years and this location keeps on getting worse and worse you guys need to hold these people accountable that work for you I've tried calling managers on duty and for 2 days you guys don't answer the phone worst Roberto's ever"}
{"text":"I love the food. But the pricing is ridiculous. Not specials,  discounts or discount prices for locals.  This is sad. I would cone more often if it weren't so expensive.  For a family of four, I paid  $50.00. Please consider discount pricing somehow. Thank you"}
{"text":"Prices are still up there, but the Jamaica tastes like it was made during the day now. I haven't seen toothless Jose around, but the cook behind the stove is just as good, sans toothpick. I like the chillaxed atmosphere in there, and it's relatively quick service."}
{"text":"Customer service is not very friendly. You feel like your bothering them if God forbid you are to order some food. Food is good though and the environment isn't ghetto or a rat hole like the one on west horizon ridge and eastern."}
{"text":"Robertos I am actually a huge fan. I am less than thrilled about the price surge now in place. I can live with 1.29 tacos. I can't live with $2.75 For a teeny cup of Pico de Gallo. You charged me that much and rice and bean side dishes are the same price! Also a $3.00 increase on many combo items is ridiculous.  I am not happy as this is no longer affordable. Be reasonable."}
{"text":"The food portions are smaller than what I'm used to in Southern California but the food is great!"}
{"text":"So good! Robertos is like Albertos from Cali but better. Huge portions. Bomb Carne Asada, no fatty pieces. We will be frequenting here most definitely."}
{"text":"Great,  fresh inexpensive food!   They've been here for 23 years and the food is as fresh as if they had just opened.   Hard to see in the back of the shopping center behind 7-11"}
{"text":"For a \"faster food\" place this was some of the better mexican food ive had in years. The service was fast, i didnt even have my drink filled before i got my food! Extremely clean and quaint. Will return next time in vegas."}
{"text":"Another late night spot. The food is always  good. From the Carne to chicken.  It's great after a few drinks.  Try it all."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleaner Roberto's in town.  They are very nice here and have quick service.  You may need to speak as little as possible as they do not speak much English.  They are also one of the few locations with a shrimp burrito, which is very good and always served hot!  This location has a very interesting interior and it almost seems like a converted McDonald's or something like that.  If you use the drive-thru, beware that it may take 10-20 min. for your food.  They have plenty of parking and never have a long order line."}
{"text":"One thing I always seek out the minute I leave Calgary, is Mexican food. Any of it. All of it. I step off the plane, hug my friends and mumble something about tortilla happiness and they know exactly what to do. Tacos from the trunk of a Cadillac? You say you made the tortillas yourself? I'll take three.  Well, the tacos at Roberto's don't come out of the back end of an El Dorado (that's a tale for another time), but the soft tortillas are fresh, the salsa bar is complimentary and it wasn't difficult to veganize my order. It's not the greatest ever, but it's very delicious and a place I will probably ask to come back to whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place is so popular. Not the location per se, just the chain in general. Cheap, greasy, Mexican fast food is their specialty. The food is just ok. This visit we got the Carne asada nachos, (side note: always get the pico, sour cream, and guacamole on the side, so if you don't finish right away, the nachos don't get soggy in the fridge) a cheese quesadilla, and 4 chicken tacos. On Wednesdays the chicken tacos are $1, and they are tasty and filling. The nachos were pretty bland. Matter of fact all the meats are flavorless. I'm pretty sure they don't put any seasoning on anything. I  always doctor my food up with lots of lime, s&p, and green salsa, then it tastes better. The quesadilla was swimming in grease, so it was extremely unappetizing. I'm sure I'll eat at Robertos again, but probably not this location."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a quick bite either after a long night of work or after a long night of drinking. I usually get the same thing (Cali burrito and rolled tacos) but I have tried the nachos and asada fries and both were good and plentiful. This place isn't the place for you if your looking for a nice place to go eat. It's purely a casual spot to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am sick and tired of the same girl forgetting something from our orders. My boyfriend and I both work down here in Henderson and we've gone here numerous times to pick up some food after work at both the drive thru and inside. At first, we understood that this girl was new when she forgot our bean burrito and rice. The second time, she forgot our guacamole and beans. And last night was the last straw with this location. I ordered a carne asada fries and she freaking forgot them. We live 40 mins away from this location and we were tired and just anxious to get home and grub.I was just so livid. She ALWAYS forgets something! We have wasted so much money here ever since she got hired. She is very nice (she's the one who works nights and is petite) but she has been there for months already now, and still forgets to put everything in our bag. I have wasted around $14 at this place 'cause I expected my order to be all there. They do not answer their phones too often either, AND she forgot to give me my reciept last night for the food +the carne asada fries I never got. Go to a different location if you want all the food that you paid for or come here in the morning (the food really is bomb) when the employees are on top of their game."}
{"text":"Food is good or at least what you'd expect but the service is horrible. In the middle of my order the cashier takes a phone call without even saying \"hold on please\" then doesn't ask the person on the other end of the phone to hold while she completes my order. Just leaves me there standing. Then shorts me on my change, doesn't apologize when I point it out to her. And lastly, the restaurant was dirty and the bathroom was disgusting"}
{"text":"Gave this place 5 stars. Some really good fast  Mexican food that is close by and its 24 hour. Defiantly excited about that! Love the breakfast burritos with bacon chorizo cheese and potato, perfect horchata and spicy green salsa. Love that u can eat in at any time. Cheep prices and good sized portions as well............looking forward to coming back again"}
{"text":"One of us canceled their order and I never ordered. My friend was confused because the menu showed sliced tomatoes and the cashier said they did not offer them. I asked for a chicken burrito without bell peppers, the same cashier said they were pre-made and they could not remove them. I gave them one star for false advertising and pre-making the food."}
{"text":"There is a Roberto's very close to my house so we go quite often. That being said, our order is almost wrong and not cooked correctly (the tacos are usually coated in cold brown oil). If I order a beef taco I get chicken. If I order a bean tostada I get meat and the shell is so soft and oily it's impossible to eat. When I complain the staff has NEVER apologized. They have me save my food until I have the time to return it. No apology, no credit, no nothing. This visit will be our last."}
{"text":"I usually hit this Roberto's location about once a week but after tonight I probably won't return. Besides the fact that I was the only person there and had to wait 10 minutes just to pay for my food, my enchiladas were cold and while I was waiting I spotted this little guy walking around the dining room. Totally grossed out. Cold food, wait for no reason and cockroaches? No thanks!"}
{"text":"The food is on point & the customer service is friendly. The place itself is clean & in a good area. One of my favorite spots for a cheat meal."}
{"text":"Went here specifically for the carne asada fries and was disappointed. Not bad, but not exactly what I was hoping for. Might have to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Esther and rueben do a great job running the night shift at this location. We order Nachos and rueben gets them out super quick and delicious while Esther makes small talk. By the time we finish up with her food is ready and always good."}
{"text":"At this location, I had a pathetically small $3 bean burrito with rancid-tasting beans wrapped poorly in an undercooked tortilla which was served to me just over room temperature.  I also received a mushy fish taco on a refrigerator-cold tortilla with SWEET COLE SLAW (but with wilty iceberg lettuce) on it.  The salsa they gave me leaked all over the bag/food/my car/pants/some mail. I threw out half the taco because it was so soggy I couldn't eat it. Surprisingly, I had only a little indigestion after the nausea subsided. There is plenty of 24 hour dining in this town; I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good carne asada fries and less than five minutes from the strip   Their green sauce is good too. Definitely a hit and I wouldn't mind eating here again"}
{"text":"Omg this has got to be the slowest Robertos I have ever been to and dirtiest. I want to rant some more but it would just be redundant. This particular location, I would not recommend if your in a rush."}
{"text":"Pathetic compared to the other Roberto's I'm used to. The place was clean and the staff was friendly but that's it. My carne asada fries came so fast, I was skeptical. The fries were reheated and the beef was old and warm. They should be embarrassed to serve such sub-standard quality. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"January 4th 2017. Chicken Taco Wednesday and their Carne Asada Fries are the only thing good about this place. Don't expect clean tables or good customer service. Get everything to-go!   I work at the mall right across the street from this location. Walked in during peak hour around 130pm-2pm on a Friday, so I expected it to be crowded. I order ten chicken tacos for my entire staff and reminded the woman about the employee discount we receive for working in the mall. She rolled her eyes and told her coworker in Spanish \"This girl is trying to get a discount. What do I do?\" I've been to this location a million times and remind them each time. They thought I was lying, however gave me the discount anyway.   My staff was satisfied with the food, but service I received to go get it was not worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I asked for no pico! And they give me extra ! Sucks when ur home already and hungry!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are staying in Vegas for the weekend and found a cool home with private master suit to stay in rather then a hotel, great choice! anyway...we wanted to find a local place that was well priced and good food, so of course I check out Yelp on my iPhone!  Found this place and decided to try it.  Wow is that a lot of food!  I got the bean tostada and cheese enchilada plate and my hubby got 2 fish tacos and a bean and cheese burrito thinking its small...well it wasn't lol, way too much food!  The beans were a bit salty, which is saying something because I love salt, but everything else had great flavor.  I have eaten at one other mexican food place out of a gas station and it was amazing too!  There is something to these little places, I have no idea what but it is awesome lol."}
{"text":"Not bad. Authentic Jalisco style. I would come back."}
{"text":"Good service and clean place. The food is cooked to order, nothing reheated. Prices are food, portions are just right where you always have some left overs."}
{"text":"Saying we come here a lot is an understatement! Everything on the menu is pretty good and and best of all - cheap. My favorites are the breakfast burritos, carne asada fries, rolled tacos and California burrito. Open 24 hours, we end up here after a late night out more times than I care to admit. Service is pretty good and they accommodate most requests."}
{"text":"Roberto's can practically hit the spot for any kind of mood: haven't had it in a while? Get Roberto's. Drunken night? Get Roberto's? Craving Mexican food that's near your house but a step up from Taco Bell? Get Roberto's.  I usually order the carne asada fries, no beans. I've also had their fish tacos (quality varies from location to location), their chicken tacos in hard shell, and the carne asada burrito. I would say that anything with carne asada is my favorite.   Sometimes the wait here can be extremely long if there's a bunch of people. So I just phone in my order and pick it up since it's nearby.   Average Mexican joint, nothing too special. But definitely hits the spot if you're craving it."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible workers, terrible service. I did not feel welcome as i walked in. The way my food was handled was poorly and very shitty. I didnt even get to finish it because it was that bad. They skimped me out on a lot of stuff especially the meat. I felt it was worth a 3 dollar burrito instead of 8. This place used to be good. Now its an entirely different shit hole."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food joint that is open 24-7. Satisfies any taco/burrito/etc craving you have at any time of the day. There is a salsa bar with pickled veggies that is self serve, which is nice. It's also a chain that is all across the city.   I have tried the carne asada burrito, California burrito, chicken chimichanga, and Machaca (shredded beef and eggs).  I wasn't blown away by any of it, but it was still tasty for being fast food.  I think my favorite out off all of them was the carne asada burrito. The restaurant itself is kept pretty clean."}
{"text":"After the worst costumer service, i open the cheesy been borrito and guess what i found when i opened the wrapper? Mice poo!!! OMG!!!  Its like storage no restaurant. Ill never go again!"}
{"text":"Everything is tasty and the service is great! My favorite is the Shrimp Burrito and chile relleno Burrito.  And a JAMAICA to wash one of those bad boys down."}
{"text":"Always a winner with us.  I believe the best Taco shop in vegas When we have that rolled taco urge or a great carne asada burrito. You  have to have Robertos"}
{"text":"Ok, Now I realize that as a Californian I am spoiled by delicious Mexican food. I also realize that as someone who is partially of Mexican decent and has had my aunts fabulous food that I may be ruined forever to the nastiness that is fake Mexican food. But come on! This place is craptastic and there is no denying it. It tastes like your Dutch cousin went to Albertson's and went to the Ethnic food aisle and took a stab at making some Mexican food.  I asked the lady behind the counter what exactly \"rolled tacos\" were, and asked if they were similar to soft tacos, just rolled up or something like that, and she said yes, so I ordered that platter. What I got was 3 taquitos from Costo that had been microwaved and so were mushy and disgusting, covered in store bought guacamole and sour cream. The sides were no better. \"Spanish rice\" if you could actually call it that, that was mushy and gross, and canned refried beans that are screaming \"hi! I'm not fresh and yummy, but from a can and about as bad as you can get!\" Bleh Bleh Bleh!   Jason's food was no better. His stuff was literally sitting in a pool of grease from the fryer and had no taste other than old, over used grease... gack!  This place wanted to make me go back and rate all the other Mexican places I have ever been to a few points higher. I know that people say that Mexican food outside of California sucks... but god damn..."}
{"text":"The service was ok but the cleanliness was not up to par. The cold station had sauce all over the counters, the floors was dirty, has trash on the floor and black spill marks from drinks being spilled and not cleaned up, then I asked for my drink I paid for and she tried to give me a water cup and I said no I paid for a drink. She forgot that fast. They seem lazy. For it to be a new business it should at least me clean. Even the doors was filthy"}
{"text":"For my anytime I crave a carne asada burrito or carne asada fries. Roberto's is here! Open 24 hours a day, you can get your fix the way you like it now or later! Based off San Diego...this franchise is like the McDonalds of authentic Mexican fast food.  They are on all sides of town...from eat in restaurants to small take out only gas station corners...so they are practically everywhere.  Be aware of some copy cats...some just plain dont get at this level. But also know there are a few others that do justice, and sometimes even better than Roberto's....  This location borderline of Summerlin is clean and safe.  It's a small take out only shop, so it can get cold or hot outside depending  on the time of day and season of the year you choose to fulfill your craving.    If out door dining is your thing and the weather is complying, one may feast at the patio tables....about 3 tables with 4 chairs each. Hardly anyone sits there so it should be ample enough.  The huge windows up front are nice and you can see them cook your food...so that's great as well.   Like I said there are tons of Roberto's across town...but this place i can vouch for that delivers on quantity and quality for what it is. It is quick and convenient and call me biased but it is a 1 minute drive away from my house.  If you are ever in the area, want something quick, don't mid take out and Roberto's is your thing ...  You can trust this place. NoM NoM goodness! Arriba!!!"}
{"text":"This new location on the west side of Vegas is in a lil cozy snag of the neighborhood. Located just off Desert Inn and Hulapai, you will find this Roberto's next to a couple of other establishments. The menu is like any other of the gazillion Roberto's located in Vegas....I swear it's like they have more locations than McDonalds lol. But in all seriousness of that serious joke, the menu and prices are on par with what you would expect. Prices are great and quantity and quality is excellent.  Restaurant is clean and well spaced out, and the building's exterior stone brick motif gives it an elegant touch.  There is even a drive thru! Definitely a plus for those late night craves if I don't want to go out of my car and want a quick take home meal even tho service is already quick for in store order. Favorites for me as other places would be carne asada fries, California burritos, carnitas just to name a few. Definitely one of the nicer robertos in town."}
{"text":"I grew up 15 min from the TJ border and this franchise is based in Chula Vista... Where I lived . Fast, hot, and authentic Mexican fast food ... Finally a California Burrito and a Machaca Burrito in Las Vegas that doesn't suck. Keep I mind it's fast food.... Not fine dining. This store is much cleaner than others I've been to in to in town"}
{"text":"I love and have frequently ate at Roberto's over the years the food is always amazing unfortunately the past two times that I have picked up burritos Carne Asada the beef has been stone cold..no exaggeration. This has not been the case during the day shift only at night after midnight."}
{"text":"The beef chimichanga meal is my favorite!  One of the places I can count on the food quality and quantity being consistent.  When people stop in town and need a quick meal 24hrs of the day Robertos on Vegas Dr.  :)"}
{"text":"I came in here to get my taco Tuesday on.. Sadly, no deals for taco  I instead found a deal for the breakfast burrito on Tuesday.  Got myself a breakfast log and a carne asada for the coworker.  Took awhile for them to get my order out.  While waiting, I packed up a few spicy sauce and mild for takeout.  Pick-up is fairly easy since they have a number system on the receipt.    Back in my office, I unwrapped my log and was amazed already by the size.  Took a bite and was burnt by the hotness.  Even though it took me 5-10 mins to get back, my log was still hot!  Awesome!  I am glad they packed it full of eggs, hash, bacon bits.  Everything tasted good; mainly because I was starving.  I'm sure my coworker was happy too with his, since he devoured his before I even got half way.    Plenty of seating inside the restaurant.  Mainly booth seating.  Parking may be an issue at lunch rush.  I always have a hard time here around noon till 1."}

{"text":"I just recently moved to Vegas.  I was hungry and thought I would try their beef taco dinner.  I was surprised how good it was.  My son loves their carne asada tacos.  It is fast Mexican food and they are open 24 hours a day.  There are several locations of Roberto's which is great by me.   I have been going to Roberto's at least once a week since I have been here.  The great part is you can go whenever you get hungry for Roberto's.  They also have daily specials which are a great bargain and come with a drink.  I tried one of their carne asada taco specials and I can see why my son loves them.  I would definitely recommend you try Roberto's if you are near one and find yourself hungry.  You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was horrible, I would have rather eaten Taco Bell. Chicken tacos have no flavor, the burritos were not rolled completely nor tasty. The cashier also wasn't friendly. Just bad experience overall, will not be returning"}
{"text":"Having visited this one a few times, now I see why Roberto's are so common around Vegas. Good food, good prices, 24 hours.   Range of good burritos at a good size for 4 bucks or less - beef, chicken, machaca and chorizo w/ eggs. With the chorizo, spring for guac and pico on it, it's exceptional. I find the chicken is better than the beef if you want to go cheap as possible IMO. Stuff like carne asada, al pastor, etc. is $5.60.  The $1 Wednesday chicken tacos are very comparable to El Pollo Loco's crispy taco and a good deal at that price. Limit 6 per person though.   Carne asada fries for $7 are bomb for the ultimate cheat day meal. Just a massive pile of Not Healthy but oh man does that hit the spot once in a while."}
{"text":"I have to say out of all of the Roberto taco shops around the city this one I feel is one of the cleanest oh that was good the chimichanga combo plate but you can't go wrong with Roberto's"}
{"text":"Not Faustos.  That is all this review should be but I'll do it a bit bigger.  I like that they are open late, I like that they are near my house, and I like how it is clean, spacious, and I feel safe late at night.  I don't like how greasy the food is and how after about 90% of the times I have eaten there I am immediately sent to the bathroom.  Now, some of my friends don't have this problem with them but I have on multiple occasions.  I think it depends on the order.  Any burrito or fried burrito and this sensation is very apparent so be aware.  I don't go often for this reason alone.  The prices are fair and there are good aspects to this place but one bad one trumps them all."}
{"text":"Three words, CARNE ASADA BURRITO. I get mine with no pico(or salsa mexicana) and I add cheese and sometimes sour cream(it comes with guac already). For about 6 bucks, it's the best. I've lived in SoCal, and these stand right up there with all my faves from Oceanside and Vista."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in NYC: a panel high on the wall with photos of all the dishes. Tiny sketchy place. I got a chimichanga  and by God it was one of the fattiest things I've eaten in my life. Scratch one more restaurant off the bucket list."}
{"text":"Food always arrives fast, tables are clean. The only complaint and this may sound silly, but their napkins are so light that when you pick up the food tray and walk to your table, the napkins start flying all over the place. This has happened to me every time."}
{"text":"The usual Roberto's Taco Shop fare; however, this being a rather new Roberto's, it still retains it's fresh and clean looks.  I always either get the three rolled tacos (Taquitos) or a Carne Asada burrito depending on how hungry I am. They definitely get it right, but in a town full of Roberto's, it's hard to get it wrong when they set the standard.  Service is always prompt with someone always on the register/cleaning the salsa bar, and at least two cooks in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Don't worry, you won't die eating their tacos.  If you're up a 2 am and hungry, this place is the go to spot. That's pretty much an open Roberto's in the Spring Valley hood.   Just like any Roberto's...wash your hands prior to eating."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos in the middle of the night !! We were drunk and these tacos we're the best decision EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to order a torta and California burrito with extra guacamole for my girlfriend.  Once we received our order we went back home to eat it.  My girlfriend noticed there was no guacamole added as requested.  I called them to let them know what had happened.  The girl on the phone said I could come back in. I assumed that theyd make me another order.  I got there and they told me since I didn't bring back the burrito they will not be able to make me another one. They offered to return the extra dollar I had paid for the extra guacamole. I was not very thrilled with this. I would recommend if you do order here make sure your order is correct or else they don't bother making you another one.  Apparently someone is counting all the tortillas in the back to make sure one sole tortilla is not missing and their business tanks.  Even though they messed up the order."}
{"text":"Maybe I strayed too far away from my usual. I got he carne asada burrito special as suggested from other Yelpers. For $7.95 the meat was flavorless, chewy, and kind of dry. The guacamole was scarce inside of the burrito as well ;( the beans and rice were yummy though! I'll still be back though..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, cheap, and greasy. The perfect Mexican restaurant! I also love 99 cent chicken taco days!"}
{"text":"We have had delivery through Postmates from here twice now.  The first time I was not impressed...I was starving so I ordered a ton of food.  We got guacamole, chips with cheese, cheese enchiladas, the relleno burrito, the California burrito and a tostada.  Maybe I should start by saying that I am from New Mexico and have VERY high standards for Mexican food.  The chips with cheese we literally chips with not even melted yellow cheese on them, and the cheese enchiladas and toastada were super underwhelming.  The relleno burrito was pretty good and that's what I got the second time as well. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy the California burrito as well.  Only Mexican food I have had since I got here...I will be looking for a new go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"GAT DAMN they jacked the prices up here. I was just at this same location a few weeks ago and they were normal ... now everything is .75 to 1.50 more than it used to be all the sudden? Nooooo bueno.  I understand food prices go up over time but not this much all at once ... this just seems like \"Hey, we can hit the Hard Rock tourists up for a lot more than we already are, let's go for it\"  Shocked to read other people saying they charge $1 for any credit card transaction now too ... it used to be only if you spent less than $4, which I felt was OK because those things do cost money (try freelancing or running your own business to learn all about the joys of paying out the ass to let people pay you with credit cards). $1 on every transaction is excessive though.   Man I hope it's just this location because of the Strip / Hard Cock proximity and not all Robertos, 'cause I love this chain and I don't want to have to rethink our whole relationship :("}
{"text":"THIS GRINGO LOVES THIS MORE AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD FOR A VERY GOOD PRICE AND A QUICK MEAL (I have lived in Vegas for a decade and have eaten at all of the restaurants that I have posted reviews for. To START the review FOR THIS CHAIN RESTAURANT I am using the same text that I've used for the other restaurants in this chain as it applies across the entire franchise.  As you read, however, you will find that I am posting on a specific first-hand experience down below.)  I know that the owners and employees of Roberto's, Fausto's, and Maria's Taco Shops are going to hate it when I say this, but they are all the same. BUT WAIT: THAT'S A GOOD THING. It's actually a very good thing. I've lived in Vegas for a decade now and these places are ALL OVER THE PLACE. They all look the same, have the same menu (well, Maria's has a banner inside that has photos of the dishes, but the items are the same), and the consistency is relatively standard considering it's more like home made than from most of the ultra-low end and mid-range Mexican food joints. (Remember, I'm a gringo, so if you're from South of the Border, treat me like a Hawiian does a Haole or a Ninja does a Gaijin and just write me off. But for you gringos, listen up!)  The tacos are damn good and are a little over $2. The rolled tacos, what I have called taquitos in the past, are really tasty and come slathered in gaucamole. Hell, I haven't had a bad dish yet.  I eat at these places often and sometimes on back-to-back days. One of my favorite dishes to break the monotony is the Nacho Fries. They load on all the nacho stuff onto a bed of fries instead of chips!  There is the full range of types of food that you would expect, and many that we gringos are barely aware of. If you're thinking about going to this place, go and check it out. For the price, you can't go wrong.  REGARDING THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION: I used to live around the corner from this place and have eaten here over 50 times in the last couple of years. The guy who runs the cash register is really cool and I really admire how hard he works. I wish they didn't have Pepsi products, but then that just makes me drink water which is better for me anyways. Don't forget to check out Henry's right next door, as it's a good place to grab a beer and they have some interesting dishes."}
{"text":"Over my past couple of visits here I have tried the breakfast burrito, beef burrito, chicken quesadilla, shrimp burrito, and carnitas burrito.  Everything was freshly made and of GREAT (homemade) quality!!!  There is good value here too as the pricepoints and portions are wonderful!  Great job!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We went there last night and ordered 12 rolled tacos with guacamole only. We came home to find 6 with half sour cream and half guacamole and covered with lettuce. We called right away and they said we could come back right now to get correct order. Meanwhile the other half of our food gets cold, so we said no we would come back tomorrow. We go back tonight and order 12 rolled tacos with guacamole only and come home to find them covered in sour cream only. NO guacamole. We call again just to be insulted by the worker who answered the phone saying he knows there was guacamole on them. Basically accusing me of lying. Great customer service. Please see our picture as proof that there was no guacamole on them. He puts me on hold for five minutes to come back on and say the only thing we can do is if you bring them back right now. You just lost a loyal customer and I will spread the news of your horrible customer service to everyone I know. There are plenty of Robertos and other taco shops in this area, so to be treated this way is unacceptable when the mistake was yours both times. Advice . . . Don't accuse your customers of lying. Please see photo of proof there is NO guacamole on these."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i ordered a beef burrito, 5 rolled tacos, and a shredded beef quesadilla. The beef burrito was too juicy probably bc of the beef didn't strain it. It tasted very good though. The rolled tacos seemed like they were brought from walmart and deep fried a little then took it out to be served. The \"guac\" was just an avocado nothing added to make it guac. Wouldn't order the rolled tacos again from this location. The quesadilla wasn't all that great either the beef didnt taste so good took two bites and was done with it but the serving was big."}
{"text":"I had the bacon breakfast burrito. It was huge! I ate half, and I was really hungry. Sadly it didn't have much flavor. It was bizarre. I eat eggs for breakfast almost daily. Even when I don't use salt and pepper they never seemed this bland. I begin to wonder if it was me. Maybe my taste was off? This really couldn't be THAT flavorless! I didn't add the onions, tomatoes or salsa. I just wanted eggs, bacon cheese and potatoes. Well, I know they didn't use salt. I began to dissect the burrito. The bacon was good. Everything else lacked flavor. I shared with a pigeon next to me at the outside table.   I got home and had some stuffing in the fridge. Now I know what stuffing tastes like. This would be the answer to my question as to if it was just me. The stuffing was great. The burrito was truly flavorless. Just wow. All I can imagine is that it was some of those liquid eggs in the container... Maybe some egg-like processed pasteurized food? There is no way these were fresh from the shell. It was cheap. It was meh. I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first, with me being a picky eater, but I managed to love the food here.  Right when you walk in, you might notice that the place is surprisingly clean for a Mexican food place (no offense!). They were constantly cleaning the tables and floor as customers walked about. The only issue I really had with the establishment is that you couldn't smell the food. It smelled like cleaning supplies. I know it's not really something I could complain about, it just sort of takes you out of the experience.   The food though, oh man, the food. I had their \"Daily Special No. 1\", a wet bean and cheddar burrito, along with an order of French fries. First off, it was cheap. It included a small drink (free refills) with the food and it only costed about $4.50 total. Most of the items on the menu were fairly priced, and pleasant. Second, the food tasted wonderful. The burrito I had was huge (maybe about 12 inches long and roughly 5 inches wide), and the amount of French fries was astounding. I only managed to eat about three quarters of the burrito and barely any of the fries. It was all delicious.   To sum it all up, I will definitely be coming back! A+!"}
{"text":"I dont like Mexican food that much. But my husband is the one who stops here for dinner..Its ok. I think its overpriced. I like the pickled vegetables."}
{"text":"I've LOVED Roberto's for years.  Ordered one of my favorites, carne asada nachos, on 11/29/13.  The chips were bagged, not fresh fried, like usual...  Carne asada has changed...  Horchata was different.  Bring back the good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop anytime of the night to get your taco fix.  I like the rolled tacos!!!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered from the drive thru. Cashier did give me an attitude through her facial expressions. Specially asked for 3 items. Cashier charged us for all 3. She failed to give us out recipe. We only received 1 out of the 3 orders. My date and I went into the shop to complain. Cashier lacked eye contact when she was spoken towards about the miscommunication. NEVER COMING BACK ."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food. The meat inside of the carne asada burrito was super moist. The tacos were good, but the meat couldnt been a lil more tender. Overall, id come back"}
{"text":"Yes the place looks amazing now that it's been fixed up, but he drove thru line is ridiculously slow, slow than any Mexican food place ever. And the lady that takes my order, always the same one, can never get my order right, I say it to her once, and asks me to repeat it, doesn't tell me my total. I take 20 years to reach the window, she asks me to repeat my order once again Ridiculous service. I only go when I'm craving Mexican tacos and it's near my house but I tend to stray away for the line takes a million years and the lady is no help at all."}
{"text":"Good  food but the works are never rude and disrespectful to customer that are not Spanish speaks. The lady that took me gave me the meaning service. If I can give negative stars this place deserve it. Only go here because it the nears on to house. Don't recommend to come here. They need new management and new works."}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite location. They get my to-go orders right every time and the food is always made well. My favorites are carnitas tacos, chicken tacos, fish tacos, shredded beef tacos, and chicken nachos."}
{"text":"We come here once every other week, at the least. Food is standard taco shop quality. Greasy and unhealthy. Each time I order through the drive through, I'm met with loud, audible sighs because apparently asking for no cheese is such an inconvenience.  Last night I had to throw away half the food I paid for because it was covered in cheese. We never drink Soda but I ordered a small Pepsi. My daughter and I split it. It sat on the counter overnight and this morning I went to dump the melted ice out and there was what looked to be a large booger in the cup, floating in the water. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Grow up jerks. I will NEVER go here again. How vile and disgusting."}
{"text":"I love this place I come here everyday they've been short staffed but yet they work so hard to indulge my every need. I read some reviews on here and it makes me laugh. Almost every bad review that had a photo attached complaining about the food, the food was all gone their quick to eat it and complain or just complain because they didn't get their way. I know all the people who work and or worked here and they work hard you guys have to keep in mind their just workers they have no say on how things are done or priced.  I was actually here when all the bad reviews were written and you guys only tell your side of the story you guys were rude and demanding and quickly forgot that yes they work there but they are humans to who deserve respect. Above all the food is amazing each and every time I have came. Love you Roberto's!!!"}
{"text":"No star at all. Those who get anything from here are already gone. Take your choice of options: hairs, not heated properly aka botchilism...service is Retarded, then again what service? Caters to the tongueless"}
{"text":"Fast food and fast service. We ordered a chicken burrito and an assortment of chicken and beef rolled tacos. Both were tasty and the prices very reasonable.  The burrito was brimming with chicken and peppers. Spicey but not over powering.  The rolled tacos came covered in guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce and shredded cheese.  Filled us up and didn't break our wallets like most places in this town."}
{"text":"Awesome Asada fries. Went there to get nachos but settles on the fries and did not regret it"}
{"text":"Usually I wouldn't mAke a bad review over something so petty but this has happened to us multiple times. When someone orders churros it's probably a good thing to put the cinnamon and sugar on them."}
{"text":"I think Roberto's is hit or miss by location. There's 1 I would give 0 stars while another one I would give 5! This place is in the middle hence the 3 stars.   Service was quick and I didn't hear anyone with issues despite it being lunch and packed. No problem with my order (carne asada nachos no sour cream no beans and Jamaica juice) but I did try to get a refill on the drink and they wanted to charge $1!? I'll just get a FREE refill of fruit punch then thank you. The other locations I go to it's not guarded and charged so that was weird.   It was pretty messy in there too. Yes it's lunch hour but you could wipe down the tables in between customers."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town. Always great no matter what location 24 hrs a day. The carne asada nachos are the bomb and can feed at least 2 people."}
{"text":"When it comes to mexican \"fast food\" this is my spot. I am a huge fan of their carne asada burritos, comes heaped with meat, pico de gallo and guacamole. OM NOM NOM!!! Haven't had a bad thing from this place yet. Love their salsa bar with all the extra goodies. Never disappointed by this joint."}
{"text":"boo. messed up my order and had over-the-counter-static."}
{"text":"food was really good service was decent  transfriendly- a okay, might be a little wierd"}
{"text":"I love their food. Big ol seating area. 24hours for a vampire like myself. I come here a lot, they even know me now. But It's awkward sometimes sitting in silence. I even come in on my own to dine but i think they're missing a tv. I do appreciate their consistency to maintain clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Here's my down the street,  go-to for some normal mexican eats. Only thing missing is a good-dance-in-the-rain tamale.( But Maybe because I've been spoiled by my Mex friends with homemade tamales). I like the \"call ahead for pick-up\" option. Very convenient. Outdoor patio seating, maybe only good for 4 out of the 12 months in Vegas.  Eats: on all my visits, so far have never been out of anything and have always delivered my eats 100%.   parking- or lack there of, isn't so fashionable. Good for the folks waiting for their car wash or oil change, which is in the same lot.   Their smiles are hit or miss. kinda snobby at times.  On my last visit, I had a carne asada chimichanga. heart attack im willing to risk. deep fried burrito, but with a side of guac. Mmmm. never fails. of course, i can never finish it. way too huge. a sharable quality. i can count on them like uno, dos, tres."}
{"text":"Yassssssss x's a million. Maybe because I'm local? Maybe because the bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese, creama, onions and guacamole is worth the 800 calories ?   But for sure it's the best Carne Asada Fries..   I've eaten at a few in town but this one is by far my favorite. Clean, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"If you short on cash Roberto's is a winner. $7 and u is topped off. Loosen up the belt and take your shoes off coz u going down!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you're looking for fast food, but something different than what's back home, give Roberto's a shot!"}
{"text":"Can I start by saying I miss authentic Mexican food like they serve at Roberto's! So delicious. I got shredded beef tacos & my fiancée got the Carne asada burrito. We also got an order of chips & pico de gallo. Great food, fresh chips & pico. My tacos were fried which I love! My fiancée really enjoyed his burrito as well. The service was great- the man who took our order gave up recommendations & the food was very fast to come out. We will be back next time we are in Vegas!! Thank you Roberto's!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since new management took over, the prices have gone up and the food quality has gone down. The beans are now watery and cold, cheese on enchiladas isn't even melted, my order was placed with no guacamole, got guacamole anyway. Wouldn't be going back after years of enjoying their convenient Mexican food. How sad!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there a few times in the past but all it takes is one bad time and I'm done.  Have you ever gone into a place and ordered and just get this bad feeling? Yeah...that's about every time I go into here.   The place is never clean. Which kind of makes it feel like an authentic Tijuana taco shop. Honestly. It's always the bare minimum of clean....Which is kind of expected with a 24 hour place. But, maybe closing for a few hours on a slow night for a deep cleaning would help.  So, I always get a kind of feeling that I'm gambling with my stomach but the first couple of times, it was actually pretty decent after I finished eating.  I usually get carne asada fries. I mean...throughout my life, carne fries. Years and years in San Diego and SoCal and this has always been my go-to. I've gotten it here and it's surprisingly one of the better versions. I say surprisingly because just about every taco place I've been to in Vegas is kind of disappointing. Even the upper scale taco shops. But, this one makes it exactly the way I like...loaded!!! Loaded with piles of everything. It's a meal!   But, this last time I got my alternate go-to because I wanted something a little smaller. California burrito with guacamole added ( because apparently guacamole isn't included ), which is basically a carne fries in a burrito. $7.50  It took an unusual amount of time and it wasn't that busy so I started getting an uneasy feeling. The cooks were talking a lot with each other and I don't like that happening when I'm waiting for an order especially if it's taking awhile. There were a couple of customers and a strange air filled the place. I noticed everyone waiting started looking over at why their orders was taking so long. A bad sign.  About an hour after eating, I started getting stomach cramps and now at 4am, I'm waking up with stomach pains. Not sure what else it could be because that was the only thing I ate all day.   I may still give the place another chance but it will not be a priority for me. The lack of cleanliness alone is usually enough for me to find other places."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is about taco shops in Vegas, maybe I'm just spoiled from living in SoCal most of my life, but, they lack the flavor I'm so used to. The meat they are using is something different. It's cheaper and the texture is noticeably different, so, the flavor is obviously different. I can't get over it but people that have been here for awhile don't seem to notice...even Mexicans that have lived here for many years...they lose their own taste to authentic flavor. And for 9-10 bucks per burrito??? Yeah...no thanks."}
{"text":"Nice, clean Roberto's with excellent customer service! The nice cashier told me they have breakfast 24hrs a days and they have a great selection of Mexican food! I liked this location above a lot of the others and I would recommend it.  I only gave it 4 stars because well you know the food is good not great but definitely get your money's worth when on the go!"}
{"text":"I dont know why they cant clean the place up a little bit more. I have been here three times and it always looks dirty in the dining are. The service is meh but what do you expect from  fast food place. For being the largest mexican fast food restaurant in las vegas this place is pretty overpriced. This is not a restaurant its just fast food like mcdonalds so please price accordingly. I cant recommend anything other than the three rolled chicken taquitos but lately the guacamole has gotten worse and worse!"}
{"text":"It's true.  I'm a lover of Taco Bell.  I can't tell you how amazing their burritos are.  It was like crack in a wrap.  Be careful though, the meat is so fresh and moist that it'll drip out of the packaging, soaking into your clothes, and making you smell of sweet, sweet pork.  Man, I can't wait to get back to Las Vegas, so I can feast on these bad boys again."}
{"text":"These guys know how to make a mean burrito! Fast, inexpensive with quality ingredients. I like to get the chicken burrito plate that comes with rice and beans. The tortilla is great, but I like to take all the chicken and veggies out so it's clean.  Definitely a good size portion."}
{"text":"Ok. Of u are sooo HIGH and seeking a good cheap food thi place is exactly what u need to be!! Lol!! Open 24 hours try the fish taco If you have couple of extra dollor to spend!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos here are super crappy. They have barely anything on the inside. The quesadilla I got wasn't even melted and the cheese tasted weird like it was old."}
{"text":"Always consistent. The burritos at this location are a good size. I've never had a bad experience here. I usually get the carne asada fries or a carne asada quesadilla. Both are delicious."}
{"text":"One of the better ones in town. Their sauces are actually spicy. They never run out of chicken tacos on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Everyone giving this place more than 2 stars,  I pray you are either super drunk and you're going to vomit this once you get home or you're high out of your mind and you have the munchies. I ate here sober...  Wow. Ordered the carne asada burrito. The tastiest thing was the frigging flour tortilla. Carna asada literally means grilled steak but culturally, it implies to all Latinos that the meat is seasoned and grilled. This meat had to have been boiled in peppered water and over-boiled might I add.  Lol. My jaw hurts from trying to chew this poor cow. I gave them 2 stars because the staff is nice. I had to find something positive. Oh and the pickled carrots were good. Don't get the boiled meat! Adios and never again. Unless I'm drunk."}
{"text":"This was pretty bad. Even for Mexican American. I've had Robertos before but not at this location. And def this one is not worth your time or money. The other on rancho was way better. It's so sad. The food was cold. The salsa is not even a tiny bit spicy. Extremely disappointed.  The food was so cold the cheese wasn't even melted"}
{"text":"I feel kind of slimy giving this place, located in a gas station, 4 stars, but 3 just wouldn't be right. Same old Roberto's that's located on every corner in town, but with a drive-thru and open 24/7 - you can't beat that. I'd actually give them 5 stars, but they don't speaka that great and they're pretty slow. But the food's damn good, cheap and totally worth the wait.  Their breakfast burritos are huge and stuffed full of eggs, bacon, cheese, pico, potatoes and can easily feed two (unless you're a big eater). And their super nachos are loaded with cheese, carne, beans, sour cream, guac, jalapenos and are ginormous!   I don't think they speaka good Ingles here though. Each time I've been through the drive through, I ask for red sauce and always get green sauce."}
{"text":"Great service matched with great quality authentic Mexican cuisine. I ordered the special beef taco salad paired with the signature Hibiscus Jamaica tea on fountain. The taco salad shell was not overfried and the beef was a slow roasted roast beef well seasoned. Also incuded with the meal is a salsa bar with homemade marinated veggies and salsas. A touch pricey but that's the going rate for this end of town. A delightful lunch, I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my SPOT! I come here for the Asada Fries, Taquitos or the Tacos.."}
{"text":"Ugh...never again. Have been going here a lot and all it takes is one bad time. I ordered California with extra guac. Not only did it not have any guac ( which is extra charge ) but hardly any meat. Was upset but hungry so ate it anyways. Now 40 minutes later, stomach feeling really uncomfortable and sickly. Ugh...thought this was the best taco shop in Vegas but will be hard to forget this now. Can't wait to move back to San Diego where every place is good and only a few are GREAT....in Vegas, only a few are good and now even that number is dropping. Ugh"}
{"text":"It's a decent little spot with a wide variety and good prices usually the food is pretty good and the employees are pretty fast. If your passing through boulder city or just want something quick but don't want McDonald's type food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Checked out this Roberto's while waiting on my car to get done at Discount Tire. This is the largest Roberto's I've been to. They had a large dining room with plenty of seating. It is also connected to the ARCO Am/Pm convenience store.  The employees were nice and very patient while we decided what we wanted to order. The food came out quickly and tasted hot/fresh. The salsa bar was also very neat/clean compared to other locations I've been to in the past. Haven't been to a Roberto's in years but this is one of the better experiences I've had"}
{"text":"Fast easy and good.. I normally get one of the breakfast burritos on Sundays and they always hit the spot lol. Word of advice... Don't get the red sauce unless your home and not at work. Not a good idea trust me haha"}
{"text":"Hidden jewel. If you land and vegas and need quick meal that will get your trip started well... Hit Robertos.  Next to Rental Car Center. Perfect and great tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I can't give this place 5 stars because there are sooo many other Mexican places that are better but their food is decent here. This location is often very busy but service is very fast. Food is pretty greasy but that's to be expected when you eat at a fast food joint. The ingredients seem fresh though and they have a nice little condiment bar too. The main downside is that their food always makes me super tired and sluggish. Would provably be in your best interest not to eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Just your average Mexican spot. Nothing special. I come here for their Wednesday chicken taco specials (.99 cents). Other than that, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I live two blocks away from this restaurant I eat here all the time I highly recommend that nobody eat here when they are busy especially on taco Wednesday. The second they get busy they make everybody's food like garbage they don't care about their customer service whatsoever they let their salsa bar get so disgusting I wouldn't Feed a stray dog from it and when you ask for clean hot sauce or clean condiments they act like you're the biggest jerk on the planet.   It really stinks because are used to like eating here but this is now a horrible place with horrible food and horrible service."}
{"text":"After a late night of gigging and drinking, a stop at the nearest Roberto's to home is a must!  I've been on a fish tacos kick as of late - and I think the ones here are pretty solid. Roberto's is Roberto's - what can I say?  Not the most authentic mexican food (or the cheapest), but reliably edible and open 24-hours.   It always seems like their training new kitchen staff in the early AM hours (which makes sense) - so the food and service isn't necessarily consistent visit to visit.  This night they were topping everything in a king's ransom worth of grated cheese!  Too much!"}
{"text":"I've had so many friend hype up Roberto's to me for so long. I've been told that this place is the ish after a long night of drinking, particularly because their open 24 hours a day. But I can't say it really lived up to my expectations. While yes, this place was good-- it just wasn't anything special. It isn't fair that the day I went here was while I was on my cross country road trip, and had the best burrito of my life in Arizona. For this, I would go back and give them another shot.  I had a vegetarian burrito, my go to order, with beans and rice. My theory on Mexican food: you can always judge a place based on their rice and beans, and the chips and salsa. Green salsa was really good. Burrito was good, just nothing great. Beans and rice, again good, just nothing to fall in love with.   The service wasn't anything outstanding, but very efficient.   Would I try it again? Sure.  But, I feel that there could be better out there."}
{"text":"First off zero customer service- each time I've came. The food is mediocre at best and is typical of this chain. I'm not a fan and they should treat their customers at least with a smile"}
{"text":"I've been to the Roberto's on Fort Apache near West Tropicana and it was great...this one however, needs some improvement. The dining area is clean, the drive thru is great, but the communication gap when ordering is aggravating. Everything seems perfect, until you open your food and find out that the chicken you ordered is actually steak which you don't eat. Or your sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is actually carne asada, which you don't eat. Every single time I have gone to this one, if I order anything besides cheese enchiladas, the order is messed up. My bf orders carne asada fries every time, no pico de gallo, no guac...every time it has one of the two or both, or it's missing something else that he actually did want. It's the strangest thing. It sucks that the place is so damn convenient for us, but we now utilize the one on Pecos and Sunset, or Sunset Road in the Smith's plaza."}
{"text":"its now called don tortaco.  very clean place and still tastes like robertos but no cheese on my rice and beans... =( haha  all good though. i love their guava drink."}
{"text":"This place is only considered good because of how bad it is for you. I wouldn't eat here due to the fact that all their restaurants use lard for EVERYTHING. It was all extremely greasy and on occasion, the food I would get would be overdone and too salty. Its a very cheap place, and the food/experience is reflected by that. Every time we eat here we run to the toilet. I've had much better mexican food that doesn't use lard  and actually tastes like its been cooked perfectly. The only good thing about this place is the price. That, and maybe their carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food i have ever had. Woman working the counter was on her phone, and i had to wait about 15 seconds for her to finish her text message. Food was extremely expensive and wasn't fully cooked. Will never return."}
{"text":"This place is horrible with customer service!! I went once after I moved towards this location and they messed up the order, tried again and they were out of chicken, now today I went after calling ahead and ordering - they said it would be ready in ten minutes - and when I got there they said no order was placed!! Then they proceeded to tell me I was basically stupid and called the wrong place. On top of all that my food was Ice cold! Three strikes and I'm done!! Never again will I go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times in the past and always loved their food but i think its because it was always late at night and mid/after party when anything would taste good, I don't know.    This last time I didn't really care for the carne asada nachos that I had. It was huge and had everything I wanted but it was just missing something I don't know what it was, I even left full but still hungry. Maybe all that bud light lime, not my usual drink, I was drinking the entire night ruined the taste.   I still like that they had fast service and are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Great taco shop with great breakfast burritos. We stop here every time we leave vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered take-out around 11:30pm last night (1/2/17). By the time we ate less than 10 minutes later, all of our food was ice cold and it was clear from the unmelted cheese in our enchiladas that the food wasn't cooked well to begin with. We were hungry so we ate anyway and within an hour we were both feeling sick and throwing up. I've been eating and loving Roberto's for years but I would not recommend this location after this experience."}
{"text":"The food was good like always, but the customer service needs to be improve. I called this place because I couldnt find where the store was in that plaza. The person picked up the phone do not speak English period. However, that was understandable. So, I ended finding it myself after 10 mins circling around that plaza. I ordered carne asada fries and it was $8.50 with tax? around there. The guy didnt tell me that there would be an extra $1 charge for every card transaction, I just happened to notice the smallest post stating that. Now, carne asada fries is 9.50? Seriously? So, ok my fault for not seeing it. THEN, I waited for 30 mins to get my food... why? because they ended up doing the order for the people that was behind me."}
{"text":"Waaay better than Taco Bell. Roberto's is one of the best taco shops in town. Reasonably priced, fast, good portions, and consistently good food.   My faves are the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito, and carne asada fries...what can I say I like their carne asada.   I also like their salsa bar which features salsa (love the green), cucumbers, radishes, limes, pickled carrots and jalapenos."}
{"text":"MMMM Robertos! I love Mexican food! Like so much that if I had to choose one type of food to eat for the rest of my life it would be Mexican! Roberto's does the trick, it's not the best in town, in my opinion but for a 24 hr joint, they rock out the goods in fast and friendly manor. I love to practice my Spanglish here, I feel less judged anyhow, the enchilada was probably my least favorite thing I order."}
{"text":"Best Mexican fast food in Las Vegas. Can feed 2 people for around $12. Can't go wrong with rolled tacos, carne asada burrito, bean and cheese burrito. Come here Everytime I n Vegas"}
{"text":"Carne asada used to be soft but now a little tough. But still tasty in the taco. And at $4.75 for the plate w rice n beans n small fountain drink, it's still a bargain n good snack."}
{"text":"The quesadilla with chicken was super delish! The lengua burrito was one of the best I've ever had . The Carne Asada nachos had a ton of meat, seasoned very nicely. I was shocked at how low the prices were and the service was super fast. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever! Went in on 4/22/18 morning through the drive thru since they always get my order wrong I made myself very clear to state I want CHICkEN enchiladas and two bags of carrots and 2 drinks, when I pick up my order there's no bags of carrots, I was given only one bag of carrots asked I can pay for the 2nd one and was told by employee \"Aurora\" \"NO\". There was also no drinks and when I arrived home my enchiladas where not chicken, they where cheese, when I went to return my order inside the store, employee Aurora instead of apologizing to me she was actually arguing with me. Horrible place!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice.  They have a great chorizo and egg burrito.  I don't see this available outside of my kitchen very often.  Great chorizo flavor that is not overpowering.  The place was clean on the inside and service was good."}
{"text":"Just left the taco shop for a breakfast burrito and was not impressed with the cashier. No greeting, no smile and actions were like it was an imposition to take my order. I ordered two bacon breakfast burritos 1/23/16  store number 0001, reference number 0020 The guy in front of me ordered and carnie asada burrito and had to wait 5 minutes after my order was completed. FOOD WAS GREAT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"To keep it simple. Place is fast to get orders out. One of the cleanest robertos I've ever visited. Friendliness is somewhat there"}
{"text":"Clean little taco shop across from the hard rock hotel. I'm always on the lookout for a delicious cheap breakfast burrito & this place delivers!   The breakfast burritos are huge too!"}
{"text":"A little difficult to communicate directions because of the typical language barrier but you pretty much get that impression when you go there. It's a quick and cheap Mexican restaurant in a gas station with minimum wage employees...what do you expect. Anyway, don't go ordering anything special or complicated or it will most likely not turn out how you want it! Other than that, they're okay."}
{"text":"Awesome local spot for amazingly fresh made food in minutes. This place is really my addiction because of how delicious it is and how accomidating they are to dietary restrictions!  My favorite thing to order is loaded French Fries with beans, rice, pico de gallo and a little cheese if I'm feeling adventurous LOL. Or a loaded bean burrito is roght my speed. Either way, I can never go wrong with this spot.   The other big thing for me is the cleanliness of a location. And the management here really take pride in their resteraunt. Its always neat and clean  The food bar is always well kept right along with their bathrooms. Maintenance is such an important thing in the food industry and Robertos really keeps their in check.  Very delicious food, great staff and awesome cleanliness! I will be seeing you guys again soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for their 99 cent chicken tacos. First time shells were a little hard but edible. This time I asked for softer ones and wow they did them perfect. Very nice, good food, and accommodations. Great place"}
{"text":"I came here because my husband raved about their 99 cent tacos, saying they were deep fried but soft so I was really looking forward to my food.  What I got was way over cooked shells, I could not even bite them. I got dry over cooked chicken, it even was crunchy.  The one off sunset/mountain vista by smiths was way better. Mostly soft shells, juicy chicken and the tacos had lots of filling. Will not be back to this location it was sad to leave half my meal on the plate."}
{"text":"Robertos is disgusting. Even when I'm drunk it's still gross. It's anything BUT authentic. More like a American place trying to be Mexican."}
{"text":"Cheap. Authentic. Fast. One on every other corner!?  What else can you ask for?   Roberto's is the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas. Better than any sit down restaurant and way better than a Del Taco. I usually go for carne asada burrito or chicken nachos, but sometimes opt for chicken tacos, bean and cheese burrito or chicken quesadilla. I've had the carne asada fries as well. Not crazy about them. They're not bad, but just not my style.  A must go!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito without guacamole because their is sour cream in this guacamole and I'm severally allergic to dairy, and when I got it home to eat and took a bite there was guacamole and sour cream and I had an allergic reaction. This is the second time my order wrong :( I like there food but service needs work..."}
{"text":"Ok I have to confess...Roberto's Taco Shop is my weakness...BUT not just any Roberto's...specifically this location because although it is a chain taco shop, for some reason this location on Bermuda and Cactus seems to make it slightly better then the rest.  Here's a few reviews for some of their menu items that are my fave...  The Carne Asada French Fries is nothing but greasy goodness.  In order for the fries to survive the attack of the guacamole, carne asada, refried beans, sour cream, onions, and tomatoes, you have to ask for the fries to be extra crispy.  The beef tacos are sinfully good!  They are definitely not stingy with the beef and shredded cheddar cheese.  There is so much in one taco that if taken apart you can make a second taco.  The golden fried fish in the fish tacos is paired with a tangy coleslaw.  A hint of lemon juice just adds the right touch and you'll find yourself wanting more.    The salsa bar is made up of pickled jalapenos, carrots, and onion.  There is also a salsa verde that is just the right heat, regular salsa that is mild, fresh cut radishes and cucumbers, with lemon wedges and cut up lime.  What I like to do is make a cucumber salad with lemon, salt and tapatio...so so good!  That's it for now...gotta head to Roberto's...!!!"}
{"text":"moved away from my fav,\"rubalcabas\" but robertos is bomb too!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars based on quality and cleanliness. I'm not saying this place deserves a Michelin star but for a Roberto's the hualapai location is the cleanest one in the Valley"}
{"text":"Ordered food and they gave us the wrong burrito.. we told the guy it's wrong and he said he knows the menu by heart. It was some skinny Spanish kid with tats all over his arms. We asked him to get our order right and he said nah then laughed to his co worker. We said ok well we will wait here until you get it right and he said you're gonna be sitting there all night. We had to call the police and made a scene in the shop with all the other customers because they aren't going to charge us more money and not give us he correct meal? Lol cmon"}
{"text":"I used to go to Roberto's once or twice a week.  They raised their prices (about $1.35 on average) and I havent been there since.  FOOD:  3/5.  From their carne asada burritos to their rolled tacos, everything is typical for a mexican restaurant.  SERVICE:  5/5.  These guys are fast.  The food is made to order and it usually takes 'em about 5 min to get me my food.  Even during the lunch rush.  AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's pretty much a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Yelp....y'all need to work on letting people check NO MF STARS! Booooooooyyyyyyy let me tell you!!!!! If you so much foolishly choose to eat here.....CHECK. YOUR. DAMN. ORDER. BEFORE. LEAVING. (It don't matter if you ordered in Spanish and you thinking nah we're paisas they understood my order.....NAAAAH!!!! Check your order before leaving rest/drive through)  Food is mediocre, there is no reason at all to eat here, staff is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ignorant, rude, uneducated (this means the restaurants main manager, he is rude AF good luck with him, he WILL insult you, he WILL be of NO help, and like my self you will end the conversation with saying, I'll never in my fucking life give you my money for your shit in a flour tortilla burrito. True story. Stay away. You been warned.) you know there is a seven eleven down the street id rather eat one of their shity cancer hot dogs than to ever give my money to a robertos, specially the one on Ann and Losee. Eat dollar menu, eat KFC, shit eat the donuts with flies in the display from the gas station next to them.....way better than dealing with this pos restaurant with a bunch of assholes. Have a great day!!!! ****no exaggerations at all this place F U C K N S U C K S."}
{"text":"Super good! My husband and I live in the area and we always would see lines outside of this place. We decided to try in yesterday and it was so yummy. Everything was very fresh.   I had the carnasada with rice and beans and my husband had the carnasada nachos. The only thing I would have changed for my dish is that there were more rice and beans! Love that stuff :)) overall, good food for a good price."}
{"text":"The few times I have order food from here has been made tasty and with plenty of meat and toppings.   Fast service for a busy place."}
{"text":"All in all, Roberto's has great food. My favorite is Carne Asada Nachos, which is what I ordered to go and paid for at this location. What I got was some corn chips with cheese, a little guacamole, and I think there was a small amount of beans. When I returned after my class several hours later the same two employees were still there and both recognized me. And even though the food preparer knew he had made a mistake, they refused to replace the nachos saying that I needed to return the food to them. And the cashier pointed to a sign on the register stating that all returns must include the receipt and the food. This makes me think this location has a history of giving out wrong orders to go. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The green sauce is always inconsistent though. One day its mild and one day it burns off your tongue. I'm also super tired of the young man in glasses calling me beautiful everytime I come in. Thanks for the compliment but when you do it EVERY time it gets annoying. I just want my food not to be hit on. Otherwise this place is cool."}
{"text":"I went to the one on Cheyenne never again rule service root service call me and after all that I noticed they had a grade C... They should not even be in business"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Fresh salsa that taste damn good and great vegetables at the condiments area. Very very good food, however the customer service reeks. Not only are they rude, asking an employee for a napkin turned into this awkward 30 second staredown... Other than the customer service this place is always clean and food is prepared quickly. Btw... Re read your order they tend to double charge or add stuff you don't order"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious!!! Service is great!!! Open 24 hours! You can't ask for more, this is definitely the number one spot!!! In love!!!"}
{"text":"I thought this was the closest location to me, but it isn't!   I only like the chicken tacos and green sauce, pretty good. Not tex mex though!"}
{"text":"found a caterpillar in my rolled tacos. im 7 months pregnant and that was quite disquisting i almost puked. luckily i only ate one taco before i noticed it and im pretty sure i didnt eat a caterpillar thank God! GROSS. i wont return. they did give me my money back immediately and also offered to give me something else LOL no thanks! if you guys cant pay attention when making food im NOT interested in coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has the best carne asada fries in Vegas great everyone in line was ordering them so I had to try them. I guess that's why everyone goes there for that."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Ordered two chicken tacos. Very greasy and chicken meat not seasoned well. Location very clean and good service. Food quality needs a boost."}
{"text":"Chicken Taco is only $1 on every Wednesday and they open for 24hours. The food is kind of grease for me tho."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time this location has messed up my order. Both times I ordered a carna asada burrito with no pico. I ordered through the phone for pick up and the lady on the phone confirmed both times the no pico part of the order. Both times, I pick up during my lunch break, come back to work, open it up and theres pico. I called withint 6-7 mins from pick up. Spoke to a lady who stated she must have given me the wrong burrito. I informed her I was unable to get this since it has pico in it. She said that she will put my name in the book for a free burrito and she asked when would I be coming in. I told her I will come call back on my 15 min break and come by and pick it up. I call back an hour and a half later, spoke to another lady who stated that the lady already left and my name is not in the book. She also stated nobody called the store an hour and a half. So now I'm being called a liar. I asked for a manager. she said its just her and the cook and I can talk to the cook if I want. hrmm really? I asked if she could call the other employee regarding this, she states she doesn't have her number. I asked about the GM, she doesn't have his number either. I asked when will the GM, Jose, be in? She said IDK. I told her she can look at the schedule and tell me. Took her about 5 mins to look and come back and say tomorrow night. Wow thanks! So not only did I pay for a burrito I could not eat, but I also I have no time left to go get other food, so now I will be hungry until I get off work.Thanks Robertos!"}
{"text":"I heart the heck out of Roberto's!  This new location is clean and modern with the same nummy food.  :)  I am Hispanic so let's get that out of the way for the Roberto's haters.  If you aren't afraid of calories and carbs - order the carne asada chimichanga. YUMMMOOOOO.  If you want a smaller heart attack meal - order the breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon and pico de gallo - super yum!  And  if you want a slightly healthier option hit up the Camarones Rancheros - a nice shrimp, rice and bean combo with just the right amount of pico de gallo - tasty and it's not spicy.  Love this place. :)"}
{"text":"I have only been to this location so I can't review what the other location are like. I love this place. They are friendly, fast, and willing to make changes and substitutions. The price is good, higher than Taco Bell or Del Taco but the food is always much better. I love the carne asada fries and beef tacos. You get a lot of food for the price so that is a good thing."}
{"text":"The cashier was on her cell phone when I walked in and didn't end her conversation immediately when she noticed me, so I should have known better than to expect quality service or food at that point. The restaurant itself smelled a bit odd to me upon walking in. I was not greeted by the aromas of food being cooked, I was overpowered by what I would say was some sort of cleaning product. The smell almost made me turn around and walk out but I was craving a burrito so I ordered. The carne asada burrito was okay to say the least, and very pricey. Nothing about it satisfied my craving or was worth the $10 bucks that I paid for it. I ate it because I was hungry, not because it was overwhelmingly enjoyable. Overall I'd say to skip this place and head towards your nearest Del Taco."}
{"text":"Kind of a sketchy place at 3am on a Saturday night, but Roberto's has the best beef taco and best chicken taco I've ever had.  A perfect place for a late night meal after ending a bar crawl next door at Cheers.  (Don't ask...)"}
{"text":"Tried Roberto's for breakfast this weekend and wasn't let down. Had a bacon egg and cheese burrito which also included some breakfast potatoes. The tortilla was excellent, and it was freshly made. I wish the potatoes would be cooked a little more but it was a solid breakfast burrito and i'll be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"2 stars only because It was good.  I ordered a carne asada burrito to go.   Came home and it was egg with onions.  I went back to tell them they gave me the wrong order, and they laughed and said \"we know\".  Excuse me ? You know? How could you give someone the wrong order and laugh about it when confronted.  Never going back.  They did change it for me to the burrito I wanted but they basically through it my face like it was my fault.  The carne asada was good but the service and disrespect was horrible."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh are the first things that come to mind.  Made fresh to order, plentiful portions - it is the ideal street food.  I ordered the beef burrito and the carne asada fries.  Hot plentiful and fresh they are.  My quibble is would prefer a more robust seasoning for the beef, but still had good yet subdued flavor.  I would say the carne asada fries is best described as \"Mexican Poutine\" - true booze munchies. Look forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"Best cheap 24 hour taco place in town. Always good after a night of drinking, greasy, carb filed, hangover curing goodness. Try the Carne Asad fries, or the dollar tacos on Wednesday.  Get the green sauce from the salsa bar. You'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"As a lover of Mexican food and, more specific, Roberto's, I have been disappointed with this particular restaurant.  The food isn't at par compared to other locations around Las Vegas.  I have ordered  bean and cheese burritos and I either get way too much cheese or runny refried beans.  The quality of beef used in their tacos is also subpar and have I been the unfortunate recipient of its...after-effects the following day.  The restaurant is usually clean and the staff pleasant, I just wish their food was as good as other Robertos around town."}
{"text":"Good food, awful customer service! Cashier, young lady must truly hate her job, or life!"}
{"text":"Stay away!!!! The girl was rude as all hell. I asked for 3 tacos de res (beef) 2 tacos de pollo (chicken) a burrito carnitas 2 orders of chip and 2 guacamoles 1 carne asada burrito. Upon paying $40.00 I reviewed the order and questioned the tacos. I said excuse me I ordered tacos de res not asada. She very rudely answered you asked for beef I said yes not asada she said beef is asada I asked do you have shredded? She said yes but you asked for beef going back and forth a few times I said give me shredded period. She rolled her eyes said something to the cook he answered yeah well I have all day in Spanish. First time there and for sure the last time. What a shame. The food is not all that either maybe her attitude jacked it up for me. Mr Roberto time for a change in staff. The loosee location BITES"}
{"text":"Epic! The BEST chorizo, bean, potato and egg burrito I have ever had! Will be going back in my next visit to LV!"}
{"text":"I love Robertos. I live in Austin and Robertos doesn't exist! So this is a must stop.  Rolled tacos and fried beef tacos. Never fail. Excellent guacamole, open during Christmas, cheesy and filled with beef.   The restaurant was clean, the salsa bar was filled and the décor was updated since I last visited."}
{"text":"Great rolled tacos and machaca burrito. But, the smell of pine sol was too strong. Wished there would haven been outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Such taco. VERY delish. Much quick. So cheap. I am wow.  The food was great tasting, and as a party of 5 we ordered and sampled everything from the chili relleno burrito to a 12 taquito and guac plate. The salsa is bar is clean and features excellent salsa and fresh cucumbers. This cheesey goodness cradled our hangovers perfectly and my only regret is not being there on sat/sun to try their menudo."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican fast food joint! The establishment is very clean and is always well kept.   Food is great! Anything carne asada is my favorite here lol (burrito, taco, quesadillas, nacho, fries, etc) It may not be on the menu but if you ask they will make anything with carne asada.   Another plus is that they are 24hrs so when ever you have that late night craving this place is the spot! Especially after a night of drinking, this food will help you sober up.  Fast food prices and they also have several specials through out the week such as $3.99 chicken burrito combo on Monday etc."}
{"text":"The four star designation comes with an asterisk for Roberto's. It's 4 stars depending on your sobriety level. Because of that, I'll complete my review in three states of soberness, those being: Stone cold sober, mildly buzzed, and OMG did I really do that?  Stone cold sober: When I haven't had a few swigs of captain courage I'd give Roberto's a strong 3 star rating. It's decent Taco Shop food. They do carne asada the right way. Their beans are so-so. They generally top everything liberally with cheese. I'm a big fan of their California burrito and/or cheese enchiladas. The enchilada sauce is really good, just the right amount of kick. Everything is always very fresh. Their are occasions where the food just isn't that consistent, then there are times when it's absolutely bomb-digity.   Mildly buzzed: So I used to live in the houses right next to Roberto's, and on more than one occasion I stumbled over there at about 2:30 in the morning with eyes way bigger than my stomach, a pocket full of cash, and nothing but the night and some additional brewski's awaiting. At this point, Roberto's gets a very strong 4 star rating. One, because it was literally a 3 minute walk from my house, Two, because it is open 24 hours. And three, because I'm pretty sure that after enough to drink I'd rate it some of the greatest food I've ever eaten in my life. Late night eats often included Carne Asada Nachos and rolled tacos. Both very good. As others have reviewed, the Carne Asada Nachos are pretty amazing. Add multiple drinks prior to eating and you might give Roberto's a Michelin star.   OMG did I really do that?: At this point in a night you're either at your absolute best or rock bottom worst. I've experienced both, but I couldn't begin to tell you what I ate, how much I ate, how good it was, or whether I'd recommend it to a friend. Because of Roberto's convenient location, there have been numerous pit stops here at the 4am hour. I'm thinking that my go-to item may have been a cheese quesadilla. Something kind enough on my stomach not to send me praying to the porcelin gods, but greasy enough to absorb a portion of the 5 beers, 4 jaegerbombs, and unknown amount of jello shots. At this point in the night/morning/dawn Roberto's is a 5 star Taco Shop, capable of both feeding that drunken appetite and nursing people back to sobriety...one burrito at a time."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast, I walked in put in my order. Went to the salsa bar while I was waiting and it was so dirty with dried up salsa drips and spills. The salsa verde was empty I had to asked the guy for some.... meanwhile I sat there and someone else came in and their kids was maybe 1 Anadarko a half barely walking he bent down to pick something up and it was a giant cock roach..... I'm not the kind to ask for my money back so I took my food and had 3 bites of my burrito before I was sick to my stomach thinking about it. No stars. I will never go back to this one. My favorite robertos is on losee rd and Ann rd"}
{"text":"So here's the thing, I used to like this place because it's close to where I live and the first couple of times food was good. But what I found out is that this place totally depends on who is at the kitchen!!! When there was this guy (his older than the other ones) food was good!   But when there was only young people, (not saying all of them), but usually, they just seem not to care or nobody showed them how to prepare the food, but it wasn't good at all.   So I tried to give it another shot but, no, it was as simple as that... depending on who is in charge this place is good or bad.   I gave them 3 stars because of my few good experiences.    Spanish:   Me gustaba este lugar, las primeras veces que fui tuve buena experiencia, la comida estaba buena. Pero lo que e descubierto de este lugar es que todo depende de quien la este preparando!   En mi experiencia cuando estaba un señor mayor encargado de la comida, todo sabia bueno, pero cuando los encargados eran gente mas joven (y no digo que todos) pareciera que no les importaba mucho, la comida sabia mala, incluso las salsas diferentes no se si ahi las hacen pero la experiencia era mala.   Trate de darle otra oportunidad pero decidí dejar de ir debido a las malas experiencias que siguieron.  Le doy 3 estrellas por las buenas pocas veces que fui y estuvo buena la comida."}
{"text":"This is a great taco shop for a chain restaurant, decently priced and fresh food make this a great alternative to fast food especially if you are in a rush. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a 24hr drive thru open up on my way home. What a complete disappointment. Two thumbs down all day!  I did the drive thru and ordered a beef taco plate, carne asada nachos, and chicken quesadilla. When I got home I was so excited to put this shizzy down, UNTIL I opened up my containers and saw nothing but pure nastiness. The chicken quesadilla was SOAKED in oil, the beef taco was mostly lettuce and cheese, and the carne asada nachos was straight up GROSS! I definitely would have been better off going to Del Taco. And people let me remind you, I LOVE to eat and I'll eat just about anything, but not this crap! I REFUSE to spend and hour at the gym for this place."}
{"text":"nice Service Open 24X7 Good Food  I have been to roberto's at different locations but the food at this location stands out to be the best of all. its simply mouth watering. i like there Shrimp & Chicken Burrito. its hot and tasty. special mention about the size of the shrimp, they are big :) Even though i dont understand the language, I enjoy the Mexican music.  Good Quality food. Clean Restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice , clean store, I'd drive out of my way from the one on Boulder to stop at this one."}
{"text":"I came at noon on a Sunday when they had very few customers. I ordered a steak taco and carne asada fries. They came out cold and the steak was bland."}
{"text":"Have to agree with a lot of my fellow San Diegians, what is up with the Mexican food here in Vegas. The food is bland no taste at all. You have drown it in more bland salsa to try to get some flavor. The Cali burritos don't even come with guacamole I mean what??? That's what makes them California burritos the California avocados!! Wft??"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Vegas for several years. I'm in Henderson this time. This Roberto's is the best I have been to for sure. I have been to at least 3 maybe up to 5 others. I got the machaca burrito and carnitas taco. Delicious. $7.30 was all it cost. Get 2 red and 2 green sauces and grub out. You will not be disappointed. Wow!!!!! Good s..t."}
{"text":"Why in the world does this guy keep changing my order to what he feels I should eat. It's the third time this non-customer service trained employee keeps making a bean, bacon and cheese burrito order into been, eggs and cheese and continues to try to have me order potatoes instead of bacon and argues with me about something so simple. He heard my order clearly,repeated it, but is stuck on continuing to make my order a bean, egg and cheese. When I pull up to the window he reaches for my money and I ask him first about my order. He said he can't make it. I've ordered this same burrito over 50 times from just about every Roberto's in Vegas, but this place near my home is the closes and apparently Perla is the only one who works the register there who can handle such a complicated order, lol. She's the nice one and knows how make this an in and out pleasant process. This guy whoever he is needs to stay away from taking peoples orders cause he has no clue. To top it off he said that Roberto's does have cheese, bacon or beans and cannot make the burrito, wow. Those ingredients are majority of everything they put together just in various orders. Ridiculous & just pathetic. Crazy thing is when I first ordered this 2 years ago he took the order and put it together. Regardless if my order is not on the menu because it's been made time and time again. Such a frustrating experience that has me not ordering from Roberto's ever again. Even after seeing them make the news for having roaches and a unclean locations I still supported them. For two years now I've spent atleast $50 a week at Roberto's and this was the last failed visit. Maybe next time this guy has a break he can learn how to run the register with Perla's help."}
{"text":"Picking up a few things around the corner at CVS, Bear and I were trying to figure out what to have for dinner.  He found Fatburger across the way, but neither one of us was in the mood for THAT. What he wanted was good Mexican food, which sounded alright to me.  That's when I remembered that a co-worker of mine, who's also a local, RAVED about Roberto's.  We'd already seen a few of them around, but hadn't yet taken the plunge, so it was settled.  NOW I get the raves.  Quality-wise, this is DA MUY BUENO BOMB-DIGGETY. Bear had the chicken burrito - which was HUGE - while I settled on the chicken chimichanga, which was REDONKULOUS. Paired with a beef quesadilla, it looked (and felt like) enough to feed an army...and at a reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food, say, that place with the bell and the chihuahua? THIS was good stuff, yet not at all heavy or greasy.  It took some time to finish so we didn't have leftovers, (which we couldn't have taken with us, anyway), but I didn't feel like I needed the entire defensive line of the Atlanta Falcons to help roll my ass outta there when we were done.  The place was pretty clean and the service surprisingly fast for a place run by just two guys behind the counter.  As a local myself now, I sure am glad there's a bazillion Roberto's around town, so we can find one whenever we need one!"}
{"text":"I love me some Mexican food! This place is clean and pretty fast. I honestly can appreciate when it takes more than two seconds for my food to be prepared because then you hope that its actually being cooked after you ordered VS microwaved. I got a bangin' torta. Doesn't compare to my favorite spot in Chicago, but def delish."}
{"text":"Decent mexican tacoria, I got the pork carnitas burrito. It was filling, but definitely greasy. They don't offer free chips like most tacorias which is a bummer. If you purchase a drink they do offer unlimited refills (horchata included!). I also shared the carne asada fries with a friend. That was a huge serving and had plenty of meat, I was not disappointed. The only problem was that you got really sick of eating it.   Would I come here again? Yes, but its not a spot where I'd suggest going to first.   -1 star for no free chips, -2 for mediocre food"}
{"text":"Can you say...Carne asada fries ANYTIME of the day! Delicious! Oh, and their chimichanga is done right! Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! And the guy at the drive thru last night was f***ing awesome. So telling my friends in StL about this place. And going back before we leave."}
{"text":"This place is good every time. Just wish they had more peppers, it's usually always carrots hahaha."}
{"text":"Very very slow staff the cook had his chest all hanging out with his shirt wide open. And nobody at counter just stood there for about 3 minutes. I stick to the Roberto's on lake mead and warm spring area. Food was ok. Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Chile relano, hard shell tacos and burritos were good. I love their condiment section. Reasonable price and good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as always. last time I went to this location I had to try very hard to explain that I wanted my nachos warmed up for my carne asada nachos. Thought they did that automatically. Then tonight I go again because it was closer to my house. Big mistake prices skyrocketed and when I asked for no Pico no beans sub xtra cheese I was charged $1.50 for xtra cheese I wanted guacamole and sour cream on the side and they gave me 1 oz containers of each definitely not enough so I asked for them to put it on and they did a lot of each ..the carne asada was ice cold so apparently they don't heat the steak either ..guacmole wasn't fresh made from avocado either so if ur gonna raise ur prices at least don't go all cheap people want what they paid for ..i will now stick to Don Tortaco cheaper better quality and hot"}
{"text":"This Robertos is hella different!! I swear ta Gawd!! They must have a indoor BBQ smoker cuzz that pork \"Carnitas\" # 10 is straight Fiya  I get it atleast 3-7X within a month and it taste great every time and very generous portions! It's a must stop and grub when I'm not in the mood 2 cook~ Thank you Robertos on Losee.. That ish is so BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Clean spot, fresh food, always open. Friendly service and they speak English! Eaten here 3 nights in a row... yummmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I got a carna asada burrito last night and asked for sliced avocado and got spicy guacamole. Even the meat was too spicy (HOT) I won't be going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"The Carna asada beef burrito is a really good deal and I ask for sliced avacodo on the side and they usually get it right but the last time they put beans on. The Chicken Enchiladas are good too. A good bargain for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Chicken Tacos and the Chorizo Plate- YUM!  cheap, fast, open 24 hours.  Everything is always fresh.  Who can resist a 99 cent taco on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's! I've had in the past chicken tacos, carne asada fries, shrimp cocktail, beef and chicken chimichangas, chicken cheese quesadilla, bean and cheese burrito, the carne asada burrito and other delicious items. They give you very generous portions for a cheap price. They are nice and get the food out fresh and quickly. I am very impressed with their service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love going to robertos always have but I seriously hate this location the staff is rude the place is run down and usually dirty looking, one of the girls there don't even greet you she just says \" what do you want\" like seriously ?? That's how you greet customers ?? At one point they got our order COMPLETELY wrong and said it was my fault that she wasn't wrong and she knew what she was doing. Sorry excuse me ?? I simply asked for no pico because my dad is allergic to tomatoes and they put it any ways and I said I wanted a carne asada chimichanga and I got beans inside. When I brought this to their attention they had an attitude and refused to replace it even though they have a 5 hour return policy as long as you have the  receipt. I literally came back 15 minutes later. I've never had such terrible service from a robertos before I'd rather go to the one all the way on Gibson because they're so clean, newer and a lot more nicer !!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner after work. Somewhat of a line when we pulled up. we ordered a chile relleno burrito and nachos with no meat. We waited over 40 minutes for our food in the drive through, got home and i have a burrito that is packed with fried eggs, and no chile relleno and nachos loaded with steak. I am already annoyed with the fact that the food is all wrong but combined with the fact that we waited over 40 minutes is just too much to ever make me want to go back to this location."}
{"text":"Overall not bad. You get A LOT of food for your money here, and that is always a perk. I had a chimichanga and it was pretty good. Wish it was filled with more stuff (the majority of it was the fried outside), but it still tasted good. Friendly staff. The salsas were probably my biggest critique. I thought they were all very very bland (flavorless) and not very spicy. It would have been nice if they had pico available too."}
{"text":"I do not understand these reviews at all. I went to Roberto's one evening for a burrito and some tacos. This place being from LA, already impressed me as I walked in the door. The second that I got in and paid my fee, my opinion changed. I cannot believe that they charge over $6 for two tacos, which were not only NOT fresh, but the tortilla was burned, the sour cream tasted terrible, and the beans were burnt. The meat tasted horrid, even worse than ground meat bought at some bad supermarket, and I don't even think it was steak. I don't understand why people rave about this place - it is strongly disappointing. I can't wait for another taco company or truck to come out with real Mexican food, fresh ingredients, and actual tacos that are worth their price. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just this location so I went to the one on Harmon across from uNLV too and it was even worse. I've definitely had better, and while I understand that some businesses can stay in business due to the hype, this is definitely NOT authentic Mexican food. Instead it is a place that has cut corners and used poor quality food."}
{"text":"Did not realize this was a chain. Great Mexican food with your choice of red or green salsa. A lot of options but you can't go wrong with the basic tacos."}
{"text":"I work near here so o come here often. I got to give it to them, I love the open 24 hours! I have tried a lot of their things and I like most of them. My favorite has probably got to be the breakfast burritos. Yummy! The salsas are also very good. The spice level in them is a bit high but really tasty. Only thing I am not a fan of is the amount of anions that they put, but ask them no onions and they do that for you no problem. So yeah it pretty good. I will be back soon for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"The food here is great, I love their breakfast burritos! The only reason I gave three stars is because they want to charge $0.75 to put a little cilantro on it...really?!?"}
{"text":"I can't imagine that there's a person who has been in Vegas and been in some sort of nightlife scene and not ended a night with a big heap of Roberto's.  I mean, it's like peanut butter and jelly - they just go hand in hand.  And let me tell you, on a late weekend night there are few things better than some Roberto's.  The rolled tacos with guacamole are good for a cheap snack, a quesadilla can feed an entire family, and their combination plates will sate even the most drunken hunger.  The most famous however, and probably least consumed, are the Chupacabra fries.  Well, that's what we call them at least since they will suck your soul.  It's a plate of fries covered in cheese, salsa, peppers - you know, all the type of stuff that goes on TOP of your usual Mexican fare.  The odd thing about Roberto's is that when you have it during daylight hours, it loses some of it's magic and you sometimes wonder how you can eat all that stuff at 3 AM.  But 3 AM will roll around again, do not fear, and the magic will return."}
{"text":"This was the second location I visited, I was rounding up a day of moving so it was my first meal and it was pretty good. I got the shredded beef burrito and it was so juicy that the fluids fell through my tortilla, all allll over me but I didn't even care lol I was just hungry. The first time I tried Robertos, I went to the location on Gibson road and it was a late night munchies trip so I suppose the situations were different but it was okay both times. I hear this location is the best in town though! I just appreciated the drive through because I did not have the strength in me nor was I in the mood to eat inside or pick up."}
{"text":"Hm.. I had to come back here cos we didn't want to drive miles today get some burritos... This place is filthy. The floor is dirty. And there was bug on the self serve counter."}
{"text":"Other then my cultures food, Mexican food is on my A list.  Coming from Southern California how could you not fall in love with Mexican Fast Food. Im so glad they have a Robertos here, reminds me of SoCal...."}
{"text":"Love this location. Unfortunately, on many occasions I have ordered a breakfast burrito without potatoes, but when I got home I realized there were still potatoes added. Make sure to check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"The food was amazing & the employees were great!!! It's definitely a TACO SHOP & not a restaurant! Probably better for a quick lunch date than a family dinner! They don't serve chips and salsa, so don't get your hopes up like I did! It's also not very \"baby friendly\"...they don't have highchairs or spoons! But it is called a taco shop and that's exactly what it is! I got the Carne Asade and we also got a quesadilla! Both were great!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food..always takes long too receive my food, usually about 20 minutes so the drive-thru is pointless. I'm not very picky when it comes to my food, but the tacos I got were over cooked and I sadly have an onion allergy so I couldn't get the chicken burrito that I usually get at other places..and I usually get guacamole, sour cream, tomatoes, rice, and beans in mine yet I was disappointed to find out everything would be extra because anything with chicken in it only comes with onions and bell peppers I believe. Not the best Mexican place in town, but it's close to my house"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. I say that because when it's late at night and I want something to eat, I always think of their adobada fries, chimichangas or their chicken tacos. However, when I get it I either love it or immediately regret it.   I still think that adobada fries are wayyyyy better than carne asada. It's marinated differently though I don't know how, it tastes better. Clearly I can't explain the difference but trust me, it's a must try.   Their chicken tacos are delicious but it drips oil, lots  and lot of it! I personally don't like having to blot my food before I put it in my mouth. The strange part was one was oily the other was not. Imagine the horror on my face when I picked up my taco and so much oil dropped off of it, even with a gentle touch! They give a whole new meaning to fried foods. Extra greasy. No good!   Open 24 hours, has a drive thru and even the dinning area is 24/7. Most of the time they get my order right but once in a while there's some kind of misunderstanding with my \"no beans\" preference. Certainly a hit or miss."}
{"text":"The 1 star is for the customer service!!! I live close by and their carne asada fries and burritos awesome. It's a good thing i dont crave it every week, it's usually at least every other month but if i want some carne asada fries so bad, ill drive that extra minute. The first time i came to this location was 2009, called to place an order and asked what time it will be ready, got there, not even on time, order wasn't ready. 2 years ago, same thing.. last year same thing.. and this year, same shit! And! I either have to reorder because they misunderstood it when I called and then they start talking in spanish. Like i said, food is great but they need to improve their customer service or at least hire someone that could understand their customers need"}
{"text":"There are 2 soap dispensers in the bathroom,  but they're both completely empty.  Are employees washing their hands? They certainly aren't washing the tables - every single one is filthy.  Two of the employees have been on their cell phones since i got here.  Now i understand why this place always looks deserted. Really,  you don't have to try HARD to have a successful Roberto's in Las Vegas.  But you do need to try."}
{"text":"First time last time. This location is slow as hell and even after your food is ready you have to wait 10+ minutes for them to get their registers online. Ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Fresh food!!!  Carne asada fries and carne asada nachos yummy And The salsa bar all The time fresh and clean.."}
{"text":"Muy bien carne asada burrito...add pico de gallo & guacamole por favor. That's all I ever order, so I cant comment on other items at this time. Consistently clean dining area, kicthen, condiment area & bathrooms. Friendly staff & speedy service. Few places like this I visit, but frequently return once found. Cheers & please keep up the standards, I don't want to look for another place to get a consistently prepared favorite."}
{"text":"This robertos has all of the freshest ingredients in their meals. I love it!  It's also super close to UNLV campus so that's a plus!  I eat this as a post workout meal. It works perfectly!"}
{"text":"The place does not ever stop.  It is my late night stop that always satisfies my need for drunken sub par kind of real mexican food.  Seriously though, the dudes who work this place crack me up and are good at putting out some pretty good mexican grub..."}
{"text":"I've been here many times after drinking heavily. Beer mixes well with there food lol. My fav is the chimichangas. The carne asada nachos are loaded with meat!"}
{"text":"Won't go here again. I never seen my wife get so sick in my life. I'm pretty sure it was food poisoning. It even looks dirty in there. The employees are very nice but that doesn't make up for getting us sick."}
{"text":"I usually love these types of taco shops. Being from Phoenix AZ, we sure do have our selection! I ate at this location here in Henderson NV a few times before anything was not to my liking. The last time I ate their food, I had ordered a bunch of burritos for my family. Long story short, my grandpa bites into one and felt a sharp pain in his mouth. He pulled out a huge metal wire from the roof of his mouth! Almost like a large staple or a wire from a grill brush. I called the place. Even went there with the wire in a plastic baggy to show them. To their credit they did refund me the cost of the burrito. However they were unable to tell me how it could have possibly gotten in there. I won't be eating there again obviously. It's just not safe to!"}
{"text":"Can't ever get an order right. I get home and the order is always screwed up. Get someone who speaks English taking orders."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain taco place.  Go for the Wed $1 taco special . . .you can't beat the tacos for a buck.  If you happen to find yourself there on a day other than Wed, you can't go wrong with the Carne Asada burrito."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. But the cashier Ana is rude and disrespectful. Ana went out of her way to not greet me no hi she just stared rudely like she was mad, she didn't say thank you when I paid and I don't even know her. But she greeted the person after me and thanked them. She messed Shame, I really like the food but, I won't be back because of Ana. So sad people cannot just be professional."}
{"text":"Location Located in Southern Highlands, a master-planned community located on the southern side of Las Vegas, on W. Cactus Avenue, a main thoroughfare through the community.  Sits next to a beauty salon.  Lots of free parking.   It's a chain, though, so they're located all over Nevada and California.  Atmosphere Your standard \"walk up to the county and order your food and take it home\" or \"walk up to the counter and eat it inside because you're too hungry to wait to go back home\" restaurant.  It had festive colors on the walls.  Bathrooms in the rear of the restaurant.  Lots of wall outlets!  (Which was good because my phone was dying and I need somewhere to charge it!)  Service It's not fast food, but you can tell the food is being made fresh to order, so there is a little bit of wait before your food is ready.  The cashier was very friendly and made small talk with me and my friend while we waited for our food.  Food/Drink I'm from the East Coast, so we don't have \"real\" Mexican food.  My favorite fast-food chain is Del Taco (think of Taco Bell, but cheaper and you can get burgers and fries to go with your tacos).  So, when my friend told me that nothing is better than Roberto's I said I'd try it.  Decided to play it safe and order the chicken tacos.  Fresh chicken (I'm assuming chicken breasts that they grill, then slice and put inside the tortilla), shredded iceberg lettuce, and an abundance of shredded cheddar cheese on a warm, soft tortilla. Very simple, but very delicious and very authentic.  I'm disappointed that they don't have pico de gallo as a salsa option.  In my opinion, their red salsa was pretty bland and their green salsa was too watery.  But, they saving grace were their pickled carrots.  You think you're eating healthy because they're carrots, but they're not that healthy because they're pickled.  But, they were so good, I kept eating them long after I was done with the tacos.  I would go back just for the pickled carrots!  I gotta learn how to make this at home!"}
{"text":"They raised their prices AGAIN. I used to eat Roberto's all the time, but now the prices just aren't worth it. Premium prices for not even close to premium food. Such a greedy shame."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Excellent food. My husband & I eat here at least once a week. Love their chicken nachos."}
{"text":"I'm sick and tired of how I come here daily I order the same thing everyday and the manager told me to go fuck myself after I asked them to fix my meal and he wouldn't change my order if they treat all regulars like this I can't wait to see this place shut down nobody's even wearing gloves the hand cleaning station was disgusting like nobody even uses it NOBODY GO HERE HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE I work all night and after work I love to eat here I will never waste a dime here again"}
{"text":"Great hangover Food or when you're done partying for the night. Roberto's is the only place I go to for Mexican fast food.  I like this one wayyy better than the one on Boulder Hwy."}
{"text":"Poor service and poor food. Please do not waste your time or money here.  I tried to order breakfast tacos with no success. I had to get a burrito.   I wanted potato, egg, and beans. They made a huge fuss about putting beans on the burrito without cheese. They finally figured out how to add beans. I had to still get cheese on it even though I did not want it.   They sent the cook that was about to make my order on lunch. I was the only customer there. I was the only order. She could have completed my order THEN gone on break. But no.   They asked her what SHE wanted to eat. She ordered a burrito with beans, eggs, and pico de gallo. They made it for her no problem. They even used the tortilla she was going to use for me on her.   After she sat down to eat they began to make my order. I looked at them like really? She got her order first?!   Never again. That's BS. They should serve the paying customer first."}
{"text":"Very disappointed their tostada has dish detergent on it. It was nasty. I hope the owner or manager fix this problem. You guys will be hearing form the health department soon. I wish I could feed you guys a hand full of detergent so you know how it taste!!!"}
{"text":"Mixed feeling about the place.  Roberto's is around the corner from the house and it is opened for 24 hours. For a person on the edge of starvation at 3:30am, this was the perfect spot.  There are pros and there are cons just like everywhere else, but my experience seriously split my decision right in the middle.  Price: Really cheap in price. I would even compare some of the items to fast food prices. I paid less than 4 dollars for a chicken burrito and 5 dollars for a torta de asada.  Speed and Service: Standard service and attitude. I didn't expect a burst of excitement at 3:30am but I do appreciate them not being sluggish and distant. Food was given to me quickly. By the time I packed my sauces, the food was ready and I was on my way.  Food Quality and Quantity: As you would expect from the low prices, nothing is ever too good to be true. The very affordable prices start to reflect onto my meal as I sink my teeth into the burrito. Oh what a shame that the first bite just happened to be the worst. The entire burrito was bland and unbelievably dry! What I did enjoy was the fact that it was completely stuffed with chicken. If it wasn't for the lime and salsa, I wouldn't have finished it (but in all honesty, I would have because Im a human dumpster when it comes to finishing food). Now the (Carne Asada) torta was pretty good. It tasted like my expectations and there wasn't anything wrong with it. It also wasn't the best I've had, but I would reorder it for sure.  Overall, not my first recommendation during the day time but it gets a \"sure, why not\" as the hours pass into late-night."}
{"text":"Sucks!  Why did it take an hour to get our food?  Why did people's orders get out of order?  It was probably a bad day, but they did nothing to make us want to come back and see how a potentially normal day is there.  The food's ok.  One a positive, I actually got to hear a black guy from one group of people tell another black guy in another group have this exchange:  \"Hey, that's nacho cheese!\"    \"Yeah, that's what I ordered\"  \"Yeah, but that's not yo's.  It's my nacho cheese!\"  And the whole restaurant burst into laughter.  I never thought I'd ever hear that happen in real life in front of me.  That's the only reason I 'm glad I went here.  Still, screw this place.  I'm going to Jack In The Box up the street next time."}
{"text":"I like this place because they are extremely fast at cooking your food. The food is pretty good too. My favorite is the Carne Asada Fries!"}
{"text":"Roberto's has heard our past reviews and turned this place around! For a part of this summer this Roberto's was closed for renovation and recently reopened and the results are spectacular. They have completely renovated this restaurant replacing all of the old furniture food handling areas and equipment with new modern and brought it up to the standards of the best of the Roberto's in the chain. And they did it without raising prices or lowering service and in fact they've returned to the old Roberto's I remember where the food was always delicious hot fresh and generous portion. They have completely turn this place around in my recent lunch and breakfast that I had there was the best I have had at any Roberto's in a long time. Bravo Roberto Robledo and owner Mirtal, you have turned this place around and I look forward to many more visits there just as I used to in the old days. Five stars and delicious and I know that I'll be back soon. If you don't know by now you should get the daily special where you get the meal and the drink at an unbelievable price and on Wednesdays don't forget those 99 cent chicken tacos they are delicious"}
{"text":"I have never in my life paid less than $5 for a breakfast burrito that large! I couldn't finish the thing because it was so filling and it broke my heart. The interior isn't going to win any awards but with a burrito that good, there was no reason to dwell on the decor. It is also open 24 hours----if you are willing to brave Nellis after dark (not sure I would recommend that part)."}
{"text":"I'm sure I could have found better... I should have did more food research before visiting Vegas. It was not good but it was not bad. If you're hungry and must have food it will do but if you're looking for an experience this isn't it."}
{"text":"If you want Good mexican food at a good price and lots of it look no further. I was introduced to Roberto's a while ago when i first moved here, been a fan ever since. What's great is they are located through out the valley and most are open 24/7! Nothing like 2am breakfast burritos (which are massive and delicious)  after a fun Saturday night. The carne asada is pretty good, especially the carne asada fries :D. The burritos are massive and can usually be split among 2 people. They have a lot to choose from for their combo deals which include a drink. Also there is a daily specials, so if your'e on a budget and still want good food you will be able to find something on the menu. Last but not least i highly recommend this place over Tacohell or any of the other mega fast food chains."}
{"text":"It's really good food , I order carne asada fries and two asada tacos the corn tortilla was a little cold and hard but the meat was good, very friendly staff!!!!"}
{"text":"First time in today. And the service was not all that great and I have a high tolerance for that I used to work in the food biz so I know what it's like to be on the other side of the intercom. Me and my girl friend are native to California with a strong Hispanic background. When we ordered we asked for no pico de gallo and when pulling up at the window made sure one more time because my girl friend is allergic to onions, and still the torta had it. For all you Non Hispanics with a taste for Mexican food don't be fooled this place stinks. And the only reason I'm saying that is because if we didn't pay attention to our bag of food we would have been missing some items. This place is just not worth it!  This is not Mexican food i would rather go to taco bell this not authentic."}

{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant chain for the past four years and love it because of it being 24 hours opened right in my neighborhood. Warning: this is not for those health conscious and is more for those who need a late night Mexican fix and want something better than Taco Bell. Health nuts should just get cucumber from the salad bar or should already be home asleep after a night of clubbing.     My go-to meal is the carne asada burrito. My cousin's go-to meal are the carne asada fries (and trust me they don't stiff you at all on the carne asada unlike other restaurants). Before, I would sometimes get the carne asada chimi chonga meal but no longer.   The facility is clean; they always have a stocked up bar of salsa, lime and fresh cucumber."}
{"text":"Everyone always raves about how awesome Roberto's is because it's great \"drunk food\" and it's open 24 hours...but that's about as much as they have going for them. Prices are decent, but food is also JUST decent, enough to get you sober to drive home after a long night but certainly not something I'd crave on a regular day.  Also they were cleaning the bathrooms with a whole lot of Fabuloso and it did not make me feel fabulous at all! I wanted to puke! I just couldn't eat a burrito and smell that at the same time. We took our food outside and ate it in the parking lot. :("}
{"text":"AH! The Roberto's of my College Years....   Rolling out of our highrise dorm at 1AM, getting the housemates together and leaving the misty La Jolla seashore for Miramar Road in the ol' VW Golf for some late night snacking on Nacho w/ Guacamole, hold the jalapeno... I was a vegetarian back then after all, so no taquitos for me (back then.)   I have the menu here in front of me and they have locations in  California, Nevada, and Florida.   .....but NONE in the Bay Area. This makes baby Jesus cry.  THIRTY locations in Henderson/ Las Vegas.  2 in Florida (Del Ray beach and Hialeah)   The car's Navigon GPS system navigated me to this place after telling me there was a location on S Maryland that I never DID find....   My favorites: Taquitos (rolled tacos) with guacamole  Tortilla chips with cheese and guacamole Chimichanga with chicken (available with beef or carne asada, tambien.)   In one sitting (at the other location a few nights previous), i ordered the Chimichanga Plate AND a side of 3 Rolled tacos. I could SEE the Hostest with the Mostest in LV's eyes.. his EYES widened as I placed my order.   The menu does not refer to Rolled Tacos as \"Taquitos\", however. Was there a copyright infringement suit filed or something?????  Warning: Going here twice during my vacation is one good reason why my jeans are Too Tight today. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Roberto's in like years... so on a whim I came down and ordered some carne Asada fries. They were really delicious! :)"}
{"text":"I am so surprised! I live in the Blue Diamond area and usually have Don Tortaco because all of the Roberto's I have been to have treated me rudely. I literally just asked them to cut my burrito in half once and the cashier literally said \"we can't do that\" Really? I work on Spencer, so this location is fairly close. I thought \"hey, why not?\" I did not enter the Roberto's; I ordered off of Postmates. When my order was delivered to my work, I was seriously SO SURPRISED. I ordered a bean burrito with guac, pico de gallo, and rice (I'm vegan) and fries. The last time I ordered that from Roberto's the fries were soggy and they put waaay too much guacamole on the burrito. It was literally just beans and guacamole. This time was so different, my burrito was perfect and I am not even exaggerating. I NEVER eat out but I was hungry today. I even got a side of ketchup for my fries, as I have never seen happen before. I appreciate this, but I will not be eating here much just because of my own preferences. I just like the fact that this Roberto's is A-OK even for being on such a ghetto side of town. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Called in for take out. Employee was rude. Got there and they denied having any call-ins."}
{"text":"Best food in the city!  Tonight their customer service was EXCEPTIONAL and the restaurant was clean and cashier was cheerful.  Carne asada fries best in NV!"}
{"text":"Customer service was so bad, it was unbelievable. Walked in to place an order to go and the experience was just unpleasant. The girl working the cashier didn't know how to use the credit card machine - it took her 15 minutes just to process my transaction, after asking for help from the chefs who had to repetitiously touch the filthy register with their hands they were using to cook and then go back and touch the food with those same hands without washing. After all of this, my transaction was cancelled because she didn't know how to do her job."}
{"text":"When it's not taco tuesday but you still want tacos.. I have been going to Roberto's since i first moved here. Sometimes they are hit and miss just like any other chain restaurants. However I have been lucking out at this one, so hopefully it stays good. The menu is all the same at each roberto's also it's open 24.7 so when you got a hankering for midnight burrito madness here is where you want to go. My personal fav is the 3 rolled tacos. This place is very clean inside and the staff is very good. I have yet to be disappointed with my order, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a true hole in the wall place. Be careful for your safety going in and out of the this place. Other then that the place was great. Food amazing location is scary. I would not go here at night and I would get my food to go. The food is great tho and the prices are great as well."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my work,  what a gem. I went with a coworker on our lunch break at 2 pm today left at 2:10pm. I ordered the beef burrito and it was probably one of the best I ever had.  Great portion Great price I spent $4 and some change and am stuffed. Great job I will be back at least once a week here a cheat meal is OK here and there."}
{"text":"If it wasn't so dirty and smelly and if the service didn't suck so bad this place would rate so much better.   Anything on the menu is good but the longer you wait in the day the less fresh everything seems. I have worked in many restaurants and at some who didn't prepare everything fresh for the day and this place is one of them.  I recommend take out just because of the smell, but check your order to make sure it's right!"}
{"text":"Granted this place is new so cleanliness is not an issue but the staff here is so friendly and the food always tastes fresh and the salsa bar is always clean.  I know a review of this Roberto's may be premature because it's so new but because it's across the street from work and in comparison to it's sister stores it gets 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Third try dining here. Tacos are ok but nothing compared to Tacos y Tacos. Salsa bar was minimal. The one star comes from this morning's breakfast burrito... absolutely YUK. Eggs crazy over cooked, potatoes were, literally, almost raw. A ton of cheese but I'm not sure it was real cheese, given the texture. Grilled onions were not grilled, warm but not cooked. This is exactly the same as I received a month ago. Not edible to me. See pic for what is the remains of my inedible burrito. Quantity doesn't get it for me, in this meal especially. I'm not going to eat here again. Truly was disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is great for a better taste of Mexican fast food. The three rolled tacos with guacamole are great. The salsa bar is wonderful with the marinated onions and carrots. My Mom and brother have had the dinner menu which are a great quality when you want dinner quality fast food. There is no drive through at this 24 hour location. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"worst customer service. I rarely go here but every time I do the employees here are very rude. Today I saw ants in my cup as I was making a drink. You could see the ants on the machine and I even showed the cashier the ants in my cup. She looked at me with an irradiated look with no concern that theres ants floating in the cup. I hope someone looks into this"}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with their cooking . I always get the bacon breakfast burrito, or the role chicken tacos the meal. I like how they are fast but very officiant . I like to call and place my order in and they always have my order correct. Their food is always fresh . The restaurants appearance and uphold of the store is an overall A . Would chose them over the other Mexican restaurant in southern highlands ."}
{"text":"I just wanted my order of a wet bean and cheese burrito made correctly. This place gets my order wrong more often than right...  Customer service is a hit or miss.   One star goes to the cleanliness of the soda machine, condiment bar, and overall restaurant area. The second star goes to the taste of the food when they actually get my order right.   I come back for those times they actually get my food right. It tastes better than other locations I think."}
{"text":"we have been having Sausage Burritos from here once a week now for the last two months. It's been good till today. Started with waiting with nobody at register when I walked in.a few minutes went by a couple walked in and they were making noise so the cook yelled to the clerk people in front. as in ordering the clerks cell phone rings, she answers it. actually takes my order and the next 2 groups orders , didn't give any of us receipts.  even the 3rd group asked for a receipt and the girl said it wasn't necessary . while I'm waiting the party after me gets there food and started eating, while I'm waiting the girl comes out tells another group that they are out of bacon so they needed to switch their burritos while mine are sitting in the window . then she gets mine finally and I get home. Both are sausage burritos , one of them was filled with sausage the other had  would say scraping of sausage if that, mainly a bunch of potato. Overall I gotta say this was the worst experience in this place out of all the times we have went. Still dumb founded by the girl answering her cell phone while taking my order"}
{"text":"Worst location I've ever been to. I came in here after a party at the Hard Rock Hotel in January and it was disgusting! All the tables were extremely dirty and gross yet all the men were in the back laughing and on their phones. I mean sure it's fine if you want to have fun on the job but make sure everything is done before doing so. I ordered 3 beef rolled tacos. When I ordered the guys were all laughing at me in the back and the cashier was just smiling trying not to laugh. That's so damn rude. I had half of one and noticed it tasted differently, looked down, and it was chicken. At this point I'm really mad but I was so hungry that I just kept eating it. I bit into a toothpick. I picked up the little container, and slammed it on the counter. I said I want it remade and I will not pay for it. And that I want it to be beef. The man looked scared and went in the back and made it and it was fresh and perfect after that. The service here is repulsive. The store is disgusting. The food is okay. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I love carne fries with extra pico and sour cream!!! Also the beef rolled tacos. The chicken ones are a bit salty at times. Robertos isn't my first option for Mexican food, but I still like it!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night because it was the only thing open around me at 3 am. I was a little disappointed they didn't have drive thru service because I was so tired and didn't really feel like getting out of my car. So I parked outside and walked in.  Now I've been to other locations before and was not at all impressed with their food. However, at this location, the food was actually good. I'm not exactly sure if it was because I was super hungry so anything would have taste good to me at that time. Or it was because the food was actually good.   The wait for my food took longer than I would have expected. I was sitting in the restaurant for a good 15 -20 mins before I received my take out. I was going to eat there at the location, however there was some ruckus going on outside. A drunk man and his girlfriend were fighting outside and it was getting physical so I decided maybe take out would be best.  After I received my food and took it home to eat, I actually enjoyed it. I'm happy it's close to home and open 24hrs. Whenever I need a late night fix, I'll be sure to stop by here."}
{"text":"The food is as good as always,  but HOLY DAMN have they raised the prices!!! Two meals cost us $21!!! This used to be the great late night cheap place for good food. Guess we'll be going to Tacos El Gordo from now on.  Bull shit."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nasty, saw a roach scatter across the counter near the cashier... then i looked a little harder and noticed this place is dirty and messy. To top it of there are sketchy people around asking for money as you try to order... needless to say i did not order my food. There are plenty of nice Roberto's close by. Screw this location !"}
{"text":"By far one the best locations in the LV area. The food always taste fresh and seasoned perfectly..  the cooks are consistent and the staff people are friendly. Clean inside also. I usually get the asada burrito with rice and cheese enchiladas... always warm and cooked perfect..try this location out for sure"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours a day. Carna asada burrito is pretty good, along with there cheese enchiladas. Hits the spot when your on the run and craving some mexican food. Salsa bar is nice also. prices are moderate. Definitely better then some other Roberto's I have been to around town."}
{"text":"Whenever the craving for Mexican food hits, I go to this Robertos. The food is consistent and the place is pretty clean. I get one of three things: a California burrito, carne asada nachos, or a breakfast burrito. The nachos are massive so my husband and I usually share. Everything is seasoned well and really fulfills my need for a greasy delicious fix."}
{"text":"Ordered something not on the menu...a Chorizo and Egg taco salad with no shell. Although communication was difficult the food they served me was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"FOOD: I haven't found a single thing I don't like from the menu. The only thing that's kind of a rip off was the Fish Tacos. They're pretty much a fish stick with dressing, lettuce and a taco shell. I will mention that the Chicken Chimichanga is unbelievable. Best mexican food thing I've ever had. Only problem with the food is that they put Guacamole on everything which I don't like at all. You can easily order it without. Also once the Mountain Dew wasn't actually Mountain Dew and was orange.  EMPLOYEES: Don't go during the day! There is one of the nastiest cashiers I've ever met there. She doesn't where a name tag but she is a 20 something year old mexican girl. My girlfriend changed her mind last minute that she wanted a drink and the girl rolled her eyes and was completely inappropriate about the whole thing. We now only go at night and the girl at that time is as nice as could be.   ESTABLISHMENT: It's never been dirty when I was there but it is a little dingy and dark. We usually get food to go though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got me rolled tacos last night. I found a toothpick in it.. HOW LOL. Every time I come here they make things way worse than the location I used to does. Going back to Warm Springs and Durango. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican restaurant that I have ever eaten. There wasn't any other restaurant that was open on New Years day and I was craving Mexican food. I saw this location so I wanted to try it. I ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans on the side. The burrito along with the side were nasty. The chicken was really salty. The beans and rice tasted like they put a tub of salt. I couldn't eat it so I threw it away. Next time, I will just starve to death."}
{"text":"Hate to but wish I could give zero stars!!! I love Robertos but this is by far the worst visit ever!!! If you want carne asada fries don't go here!!! I asked for extra gauc and cheese, got charged for both and got neither and hardly any steak. I don't care if it's 12pm or 12am you should always be giving 100 I'm a server and work till 1am and we always strive to put out awesome food no matter how late or tired we are. From my experience here, they could care less. Also paid for 2 tacos and only got one.  Probably won't risk a another trip here."}
{"text":"I just had the most unpleasant experience at this location. I ordered the carne asade QUESEDILLA, and was given the carne asade fries at the drive thru. When I realized it was the fries, I waited for someone to come back to the window with no luck. So I parked and went inside to get it fixed. I stood at the counter for a couple minutes before someone decided to finally come to the counter to help me. On top of already waiting far too long to be assisted, the lady that helped me was so unbelievably rude to me. I told her the situation and from the get go, she started arguing with me telling me that I ordered the fries. I have never ordered the carne asade fries in my life and was actually ordering for a co-worker straight from the order she wrote down for me. So I KNOW I ordered the quesadilla. The lady kept blaming me and telling me it was my fault. At this point, I was furious but didn't want to cause a scene. So I stood there quietly while they made the quesadilla and decided to check the prices of both items and noticed the fries are more expensive than the quesadilla. Typically, I am the type of person to just shrug it off and not worry about the price difference. However, when she handed me the food with attitude and immediately walked away without offering any type of compensation for the price difference, I decided I had enough of being treated like crap and wanted my money back.  As she was walking away, I had to grab her attention again and she was NOT pleased. I explained to her the price difference and immediately she threw her hands in the air and said again \"it's not my fault you said fries\". I was so baffled that someone would treat a customer so badly no matter whose fault it was that the order was wrong. No matter who is at fault, I came in here calmly to get the issue fixed. I did not deserve to be treated the way she was treating me.  She then said something to one of her co-workers (which she had likely been talking badly about me the whole time- too bad I don't understand Spanish). He told her the price difference between the items and she opened the register and basically threw a dollar at me and said \"Here\". Mind you, the price difference is $1.15 and I was charged the tax on the more expensive item. Again, I normally blow this kind of thing off especially because it really wasn't a big price difference. However, no customer should EVER be treated the way I was treated no matter who was at fault for the order being wrong. At this point, I only wish I would have made a bigger scene and demanded a full refund and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"I always get California burrito day or night and I don't get tired of it. It's nearby my house"}
{"text":"This restaurant really needs to work on customer service. When you go through the drive thru and it takes 3 min for someone to acknowledge you (though not s greeting) it really bothers me. When I get to the drive thru window there isn't a \"hello\" or \"how are you\" just an abrupt opening and \"5.95\". I used to manage fast food restaurants and I always told my team \"5.95\" is not a greeting. Just no excuse for not having basic customer service training. I've been all over Mexico and got warmer service even in the poorest of areas so language barrier isn't an excuse either. Yeah it's Roberto's and I shouldn't expect much but maybe they want to improve their business. Who knows."}
{"text":"Meh. This location wasn't as good as the one downtown but it was more of preference. My fish burrito was decent but the fish was a bit burned and had enough lettuce for a side salad. Wife's fish tacos had the same problem. Ordered chips and guacamole/sour cream and expected to be able to dip them. Nope, they come drenched in the toppings and was soggy before I made it back home. 3 stars because the food is pretty good but you should probably go earlier in the day and not take advantage of the 24 hours."}
{"text":"Big bowl Taco salad is sooooo goood! & Carne asada brito & corn tortilla tacos is yummy & big !!! 3 taquito flautas with juacamolle & sour cream is sooo good ! qusadilla is big & yummy !!!"}
{"text":"La comida esta vien pero mucha basura en segida de las sodas y eso los ase ber muy mal"}
{"text":"There are huge portions for a good price here, and I thought the salsa and pickled Jalapeño bar were both spot on. The tostada was good as were the beans. My issue here was that the food should have been hotter (temperature). The cheese was put on but never put in a broiler or something to melt, leaving me with a lot of unmelted cheddar in and on top of the enchilada. Given the options in this town, it's a solid place to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"I've been to this robertos a few times and it well. but this time when I went it was like a 25 minute wait from the drive thru. Then I get the food and in the green sauce there is a hair. Worst experience"}
{"text":"I love this Roberto's! Nice, super fast, delicious food and the restaurant is always spotless, even when there's a line out the door. The service is great, the food portions are generous for the price you pay and being able to grab-and-go is very convenient here."}
{"text":"I got no problems with this place.  Food is great, prices are fair, service is quick and friendly enough.  Tried Carne Asada Nachos the other day instead of Carne Asada Fries my old stand by.  I actually like the nachos better, not as heavy but still loaded down with all the good stuff.  I also love the rolled tacos."}
{"text":"I am a regular Wed .99¢ chicken tacos. But answer your dam phone. I would give you five stars but I can get you too pick up the phone to place a take out order at 4 in the morning. WTH I dont get it. When I arrived there were only two tables of customers."}
{"text":"Still a fan!  :)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Robertos? They are reasonably priced, good food and open 24 hrs. It's a win win. The only thing I dislike is how I'll ask for no beans no guacamole but extra tomatoes and cheese... just swap it cause 30 cents for extra tomatoes when I saved you a good buck off the beans irritates me but won't knock their rating"}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this place. It's like a Taco Truck with an inside. The meal was average and was a little on the watery side for the meat. They had a good selection of sauces on the salsa bar and had good customer service.   I saw some people get super big burritos and large portions of nachos. My dining companions enjoyed their meals. Has good late hours."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I work in San Fernando, CA (population 90% Hispanic) that I'm just used to really good Mexican food, and it takes a lot to impress my tastebuds. I've heard a lot of hype about Roberto's food (A LOT), so I had high expectations trying it for the first time.   We ordered a breakfast burrito and a chicken taco & chicken enchilada plate (#6). The best part of the burrito was the homemade tortilla. The rest was nothing extraordinary. The enchilada was good, with lots of meat, and a very tasty red sauce. The taco was okay, but I liked the fluffy shredded cheese they used. The beans were not great, and I love good beans. The rice was okay. The red chili was good (and reminds me a lot of the sauce at my favorite taco truck in LA). The green was okay.  The shop has a drive-thru which is appealing if I lived in Vegas. I'd definitely use that when I want to be fat and lazy. Inside the shop, you have to play Goldilock & the Three Bears, and try all of the tables to find one that isn't crooked. I like the posters on the wall of the story of Roberto's. It's nice to learn about the person behind the business.  This place has good food - don't get me wrong. My deal is though that Roberto's isn't anything you can't get anywhere in L.A. at local taco stands, authentic Mexican fast food places, or at any of the plethora of taco trucks in L.A. I just expected more from the hype!"}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego & grew up eating Roberto's, I absolutely love, love, LOVE the food... I could eat there breakfast, lunch, & dinner! The reason I am only giving 3 stars is because the night crew is horrible! I've been eating at different Roberto's for 20yrs & have never come across such a horrible staff! There is no manager & the kid working the register is clueless... this location has potential but the staff needs to be trained!"}
{"text":"One star cuz I can't give zero stars. Had to wait 40 minutes for my food. Hands down, the saltiest, shittiest carnitas I've EVER had in my life. I'm fat and have eaten a lot of carnitas in my days."}
{"text":"hey this place is pretty good my friend told me there is some in cali never seen or been there before i was surprise how good it is had there tacos they are great one of the best i ever had."}
{"text":"I usually order the three rolled tacos, which is a perfect portion for me and it's only $2.35!  My husband usually gets a full plate, which is a huge serving, so I like that there is something for everyone.  I personally think they could do better with the salsa..."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Nachos are to die for!  Enough for two and very tasty. Wide variety of taste. Quick and friendly service.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Hmm, it is what it is. It's an okay Mexican fast food joint with a decent selection. I consider the food bland, but you can doctor it up with the sauces on the side bar area. The food is cheap and made fresh on the spy, so it's a notch above taco bell. The place was clean even though I went at what consider a busy time (lunch). I'll come back the next time I want something fresh and cheap, but not because the flavors are great."}
{"text":"4.5 stars   The details of of my first time trying Roberto's Taco Shop are debatable but it might've been about a decade ago in San Diego. I'm prone to forgetting entire dining experiences if they aren't immediately  documented on Yelp.   As fuzzy as my memory might've been at 4am this past 4th of July weekend, I still recall raving about Roberto's bomb-ass rolled chicken tacos which were covered in guacamole, sour cream, cheese, & lettuce, but still uber crunchy, especially at each end. A few forkfuls of his carne asada fries were all I needed to know I've had better (most likely somewhere in sunny San Diego, as well.) An Orange Bang would've made this a 5-star meal, but their cold & sweet Piña drink went just fine with the rest of the delicious Mexican flavors on my (styrofoam) plate.   The only downside -- partiers came from all over the Strip to end their night here, so counter service was extremely slow. All good, though."}
{"text":"MMM MM This my **** this my **** ( to put it as graciously as Ms Gwen Stafani does)    Seriously though, this is my favorite Roberto's hands down.  I have been to about 3 other ones and one comes close, and the other two fall so short I don't even want to talk about them anymore, SO!    My friend and I frequent this particular Roberto's because 1. It is close and 2. It is DA BOMB.  I went on a chimichanga kick for about 3 entire months and to be honest, surprised I didn't turn into one; I couldn't stop eating them they were so freaking good!  Always crispy and hot; I make sure to order with no beans inside, that's just my preference and I have noticed that the innards of the chimi seem to be less watery, which is perfecto!   My other passion is the rolled tacos, it's like being a kid in the candy store and eating all your favorites!  Well, for me it is, I just love that guac and cheese they put on top and the crunchiness, it's just, well- simply FANTABOLOUS!   I could sit here and rant and rave about the food all day, but alas, stop reading and go eat!"}
{"text":"First I need to say that I LOVE Roberto's, it is my new favorite Taco Bell/Del Taco etc.  Since moving here in Feb. 12' I can say that it is certainly my favorite little drunken munchies spot.    Now, on to this specific Roberto's.  This is the third location that I have tried so far and this one is by FAR the worst; and this is coming after a couple pitchers with the munchies raging!  I ordered the rolled tacos with gauc which tasted just like the other 2, hence why they got 1 of the stars.  The other star is because the food was served very quickly, but alas, I believe this is why my second dish was not great.    I got the cheese enchilada meal.  The sauce tasted okay, but the main problem was the cheese was not even melted inside, just a bunch of shredded cheese that I did not enjoy inside my luke-warm enchilada.  My friend also ordered our 'GO TO' meal, chimichanga, mmm mmm mmm; however, at this Roberto's it was bleh bleh bleh!  The tortilla was not fried nearly enough, the chicken was wet, not moist, wet, and overall it was barely even warm.    I have marked this Roberto's off my list and will not return, which is a shame, because I was hoping to make it my local spot on Tuesdays as it's less than a mile from my local bar."}
{"text":"Man oh man!  This food always makes me smile and my mouth water before I'm about to dive into it.  I have been here countless times and have yet to be disappointed.  One yelper mentioned that it TB and Del Taco paled in comparison, man was she right on the money!  I love the rolled tacos, all that guac and under 3 bucks; *drools*  The staff is friendly who takes your order and the environment is lax.  I have heard that the food is different depending on which Roberto's you go to, so I'm only speaking for this location.  Come one, come all - you have to check this place out!  Oh, and need I mention, Roberto's = drunk munchies haven!!!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a MUST stop when I visit Vegas. I always try a different location for variety. Which usually works in my favor today wasn't any different. I ordered the Carne Asada Fries with extra guacamole. The price has increased since my last visit, which is understandable. My only complainant is the guacamole doesn't taste freshly prepared. It taste like the pre-made stuff that comes in the bag."}
{"text":"Average inexpensive mexican place  Enchiladas are pretty good.  Their meats all taste strange for example, the carne asada comes in a watery sauce, FYI carne asade is supposed to be grilled!  I'm glad robertos exists for moments of desperation if I'm far from pepe's or komex is closed  Bottom line:      If you are leaving the club at 3AM and haven't found someone to hook up with, try Roberto's, you feel much better about not having any game."}
{"text":"Cleaner than the most locations than I've been too, super polite and they actually listen when they take your order. Food comes out pretty quick! Ordered carne Asada fries and they probably the best I've had in a long time. Will definitely come back when craving"}
{"text":"While in Vegas, I was craving a good breakfast burrito. We found this place and let me tell you....BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes and pico de gallo salsa were perfect together, but the real winner was the homemade huge tortilla. The burrito was so good we ended up going there twice in 4 days. The place was clean, quick and they even have a 24hour drive thru.  Prices are excellent! The breakfast burrito was $4 and there was an unlimited salsa bar with chunky, green and red salsa. I would 100% recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best late night Mexican food after a night out. And it's 24/7 yaaaay. Wouldn't go any place else on this side of town. Worth the trip and will satisfy your taco craving. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from California and we have these taco shops everywhere ! I thought it'd be just like home.. when I walked in everything looked super clean and the menu looked about the same.The waitress was cleaning the salsa bar and told me to let her know when I was ready to order. When I was ready I ordered the cheese enchilada with beef taco but substitute beef for chicken and all rice no beans. The service was below par, she seemed very irritated . I told her no onions on the taco and she said they don't come on the taco. The food came in a timely manner but when I got it home it was a chicken hard taco and chicken enchilada. The rice was super yummy but the taco was EXTRA crunchy. Super hard and the chicken was dried. When I finally decided to start on the enchilada it had chicken in it.. which I didn't want. And the enchilada had onions and bell peppers all in it. The enchilada sauce wasn't the gravest either. Chicken was just very dry.. needless to say the terrible service and dry chicken will lead me elsewhere in my Mexican food ventures here in vegas! Two stars only because the rice was good lol"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this location negative stars.  Went to this location because the local one by my house was jam packed during lunch. Very bad decision. It wasn't crowded or anything but they managed to forget my order. People who ordered way after me was getting their food. I waited for 10 no hues before I said something. The lady behind the counter did not even apologize. I'm never coming back to this location.   The employees stink and they are so rude."}
{"text":"I cant ever seem to look forward to eating here, but this last time was the last time. We ordered pork tacos, beef nachos, and a chicken quesadilla.  The pork taco tastes like the meat wasn't cooked today, probably recooked or was cooked and we got the last bit of the pork before they cook more. It just didn't taste right at all. Our nachos came out having shredded beef instead of the ground beef that we asked for. It just seems like a mess when we get nachos. Everything is piled on the chips, you can hardly get to any of the chips without getting your hands dirty.  Then the chicken. Unfortunately this chicken quesadilla gave me food poisoning. It was very dry, it was hot but not moist, just hot like a plate being warmed up in the microwave. All it had inside was bell pepper and onion, hardly any cheese at all.  We went at midnight, but I just wouldn't come back here. It just seems like a mess when we get the food, and now I got sick."}
{"text":"This is the worst burrito I have ever tried in my life!!!!!!!!  So thoughtless, put together with no love nor common sense.  So I ordered 1 Taco & 1 Burrito after not eating anything today its 12: 40 am! Being that I just moved here from the south all I see is Roberto's Tacos Shops out here so I download Post mates and it's the 1st thing in it.  I ordered a \"California Burrito\" (If it's anything like California, I do not wanna GO!) I wouldn't feed it to my dawg. Literally, he wouldn't eat it . The chicken taco was actually not half bad until you realize the cheese is on top of the lettuce I had to had & not on the chicken. Long story short. Stick to Taco's Roberto! Your definitely not Roberto's Burritos for a reason."}
{"text":"My last visit I decided to stay in and eat. While I was eating my nachos, the girl starts sweeping the floors, started in the bathroom and is headed towards me. I see stuff start flying in the air, I'm thinking \"she's not gonna come sweep that towards me\" well she did. I see fuzz, dirt and whatever else fly in the air around my food. I glared at her, got up and threw my nachos in the trash. Thanks for crop dusting my nachos with dirt you idiot."}
{"text":"Rude lady named Rosario at the register had the nerve to argue with me about what I ordered.  She seemed extremely dissatisfied with her job.  Perhaps she should reconsider her career path and get a job working as a Mortician."}
{"text":"I used to like this place until I tried Pepes Tacos. Robertos locations are always just sort of dirty inside, so the food can't be much different. Pepes on rainbow is much cleaner and nicer inside"}
{"text":"Glad this place has a 24 hour drive thru! If you want that greasy Mexican food this is the place for you, but it's so good. Order the Horchata!"}
{"text":"Although there are many Roberto's in town, this one is by far the best. I'm not sure what they do different, but I'm disappointed every time I go to a different one."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times, all take home and have never had a problem. Staff at the front is friendly. The salsa bar is like all Roberto's salsa bars. Shredded beef tacos are my favorite and there's always other customers in there"}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for their food,  5 stars for their service,  but 4 stars for cleanliness. Floors need mopping, & counters & tables all need a wipe down. It would help if customers cleaned up after themselves.  They serve the BEST breakfast burritos & hibiscus iced tea (try it! Not too sweet - just right)"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for your typical Robertos place which is good. I can expect the same food and service is as if I got at a different Robertos."}
{"text":"Very good just needed red or green sauce for my burrito and taco but taste fine satisfied with the service will visit again soon"}
{"text":"Total trash. Undercooked, greasy tacos I can actually wring the grease out of. Waste of money, pay more and get better food somewhere else"}
{"text":"My typical rule of thumb is that I need to have 3 negative experiences at a place I typically go to before I stop going there and think about writing a negative review. I gave this place until the 5th negative experience because I work the graveyard shift and it is one of the few nearby options I rely on on a consistent basis for my lunch-break meal in the middle of the night.   What pushed it over the edge this time? A simple order, two chicken enchiladas. What was inside could be best described as cold and uncooked. My vegetables were barely cut up (green pepper chunks bigger than the size of your thumb and what looked to be a quartered tomatos) and were still fresh and crisp, as if they never even entered a warm pot at all. The entire dish was slightly above room temperature. I will still go to other Roberto's locations (and switch to the Don Tortaco that's an additional 3 miles away if I'm really craving it), but I will avoid this one at all costs."}
{"text":"We ate here twice in two weeks. The first time, we had carne asada and adobo pork tacos, a mixed meat combo, and tamales. The food was delicious: fresh, well spiced, generous portions, and filling, but they didn't put out the sides. The green salsa was like crack-- so addictive.   The second time we had 2 adobo pork tacos and an adobo tortas. The food was well spiced and so tasty. It tasted fresher than the first visit, but 1 hour later, we both were in the bathroom with food poisoning. So, the taste and portions are five stars, but minus two stars for an episode of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Great and clean location. One of my fav quick spots when I haven't made dinner. It does have a line every once in a while. Good tip is to call in your order before you get there."}
{"text":"For about 7 bucks you can share carne asada fries because they give you a pretty nice sized portion! Plus you can't beat the 24/7 business hours for that late night, 2 in the morning munchies attack!"}
{"text":"When you're hungry, when your time is short, when you have a lot on your mind, the last thing you want is fast food, comes Roberto's to the rescue. Always open, always great food with free carrots, scallions,  and jalapenos, who could ask for anything more? Try the lengua if you're adventurous! Delish!"}
{"text":"There are the best burritos I have ever eaten. All food in Roberto's taco shop is yummy. . Whenever I come to Las Vegas. Or San Diego I have to pass by with my Filipino friends.  Actually they suggested to me."}
{"text":"One of the things I've missed most about Las Vegas, Roberto's is the perfect cure for a night out on the town. We visited this location right after we landed and I think it's new since we were last here. Very bright and clean inside and, of course, the food was as delicious and greasy as always. I'm partial to the chips and guacamole but, as I recall, everything hits the spot."}
{"text":"I found the staff to be very friendly, the pricing was excellent. Be aware of the carrots and red hot sauce though, those 2 together equals one hot mouth! The green salsa was much milder. I would go back again when in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Mexican food for $ with fresh sauces and sides to go with that?  This is what you call a prime example of a GREAT Roberto's. I understand that many of the Roberto's have different owners, but this location sets the best example.  I love that the price is reasonable for the taste! Carne asada burrito always comes out cooked well with just enough guacamole to inspire your taste buds.  I think having horchata available is a MUST in any Mexican restaurant. The service for a Spanish-speaking employee is amazing! They always understand how I want my order. I do not have to say anything in Spanish.   Always remember that they are willing to customize the food, although the generic menu is great as it is!  Recommendations: Carne asada [plate, burrito, nachos, fries, or taco] Shrimp burrito Chicken taco Bean burrito [chimichanga style or wet] - add spice Horchata"}
{"text":"Good tacos and burritos, kind associates. The burritos a pretty filling and you really can't go wrong whatever you order."}
{"text":"This is your typical Roberto's and I can't see myself giving it 4 stars.   Food is pretty solid and service is good. The condiments look a little old sometimes, so just be careful with that. I've been here a few times, sober and not so sober. So I'm sure the employees were like \"why are they laughing so much?\" I'm sure they're used to it though.   Typical run would consist of carne asada nachos, beef tacos, maybe a adobado burrito depending on the bf's appetite and a side of enchilada sauce. We never end up using it all, but the bf and his brother swear that all the food tastes better with it.   Good spot for food after a night of drinking or just a night of gluttony."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would they got my order wrong twice and were very rude.  They had a roach on the floor it was disgusting.  Then when they finally got my order right.  I look at my carne  asada fries and they had no sour cream the man said you have to pay an extra dollar for more sour cream I paid the dollar took my fries and left service was terrible DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"My office is right across the street, but I always found that Roberto's has too much oil in their food. Today, I decided my starvation is going to accompany me to this restaurant that I fear for my health over.  I ended up getting a carne asada burrito, but when I asked for extra meet... The lady said, \"Are you sure? It is $3.00 more...\" That made me question myself, so I told her, \"Never mind.\"   The burrito came out within two minutes, super-hot, and ready to go. I got the condiments which included carrots, one jalapeno, and the tomatillo sauce.  I took the entire tortilla off and just put the inside on a plate. It was actually not that greasy today! I would suggest coming to this Roberto's!  P.S. Their horchata is the best in comparison to other Mexican restaurants I have been to. Even the formal ones."}
{"text":"In my opinion they are very racist.... this Mexican guy wasn't even in line but I was dont you know she called him up to the counter took his order and after he payed for it proceeded to take my order very unprofessional I will no be coming back"}
{"text":"Ive reviewed the other Robertos near my work,  and i am just as happy with this location.  I dont usually go in the middle of the day,  I usually come to this location in the middle of the night to get my carne asada fix.  The carne asada burrito has to be made by the book because it never fails to satisfy my meat tooth.  Good value for the money.    The space is always clean, except maybe the vegetable/side items area can get a little bit messy at times, the staff is always cleaning something every time I drive by or come in. All in all a pretty clean location compared to some of the other one's I've been too. For the price, the food can't be beat.   Cheers!   -MikeB"}
{"text":"I work super close to this Roberto's and anytime I'm getting the itchin' to stuff myself full of Carne' Asada randomly- I look no further than Roberto's!  I've heard it's 24 hours-but I never usually hit it up other than normal work hours. Let's keep the long story short. Roberto's is basically a mainstay in Las Vegas and located all over the place. They have specials everyday of the week I believe, but I never take advantage of them. There drive through is always full so I opt to go inside and order and take my time eating.   Basic seating, basic decoration, almost a fast food feel to them.   But man, there Carne' Asada burrito never leaves me hungry and I have to loosen my belt notch a few notches after I eat it. If I finish it all in one sitting (which I usually do) I want to go to sleep in my comfy cubicle chair for the rest of the day. Doesn't help at work. Haha!  Anyway, do yourself a favor and get sour cream extra inside of it. The standard pico de gallo and verde sauce is good, and I love watching all the people cram all the free carrots and cucumbers into little baggies like there gonna run out (which they do sometimes as your standing there.)   Always leave full & happy, with only a few bucks out of my wallet. I can't speak too much for the other items on the menu, I'm pretty partial to my Steak!  Cheers!  ~Mb"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. Portions sizes are bigger at this location.  Staff is friendly when placing phone order."}
{"text":"This has to be the cleanest location. After hearing a few people talk about the Carne Asada fries, we tried them last night. I have to say they were pretty tasty. I wish we would have had them before. I normally order the chicken quesadilla which is very filling. This is the only location we will go to now."}
{"text":"On a whim headed back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam we spotted a plaza and looked for food. We saw Robertos it was empty but other Yelpers had good things to say and they were all right! Carne Asada plate was a bargain for 8.50. The guacamole was Delicious , the beans were so creamy and seasoned perfectly. everything was fresh and prepared as asked. A bare bones place but The food is the star here and the kind folks behind the counter took pride in their food and work . Well done , highly recommend ."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru. The food came out so fast. I ordered the tacos and the meat was not fully cooked. Got sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Our whole office staff loves this location. We always call in our order and they food it always amazing! Love the low prices and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Rhis isn't the best mexican food spot, but far from the worst. It's open 24 hours. After a late night out in Vegas, it works!   There's a self-serve salsa bar on the side. Food was fresh and I love the cheese. You can't go wrong with a veggie/bean burrito. Prices are decent too."}
{"text":"Aint nothing better than good ol' carne Asada fries!   This location is pretty ungenerous with their portions.. Unlike their other locations! When I order carne asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it. And 90% of the time when I say \"No Beans\", they always  give me beans!   I've only been inside once and I suggest just going thru the drive thru. So you can avoid coming out smelling like carne asada. The drive thru is pretty fast surprisingly.   There's always this homeless man at the end of the drive thru trying to wash your windows. It kind of creeps me out because he won't stop talking to you."}
{"text":"When I need a quick Mexican fix I run down the street on my lunch break to get 3 rolled tacos w/ guacamole & sour cream. & If I'm feeling famished I will get my favorite, carne asada fries no beans extra guacamole. I can never finish carne asada fries by myself though so I try to think with my head & not with my stomach.    Location is very clean (unlike other locations). The staff is pretty quick to take orders and make food. Lines usually get long during my lunch but with the efficient and quick staff, the waiting isn't too bad.    This isn't my favorite Mexican joint but defiantly will do the job when I'm at work and pressed on time!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the night crew. I order chicken tacos. The cook dropped my tacos in the grease and proceeded to scoop raw carne asada from a drawer that had the metal scoop already in it. After butting the scoop back in the meat and placing it on the grill he starts putting lettuce and cheese on my tacos. Uhhh. No. No. No bro. That's not gonna work. I told the person behind the counter and rather than address the issue and offer to make it right he flat out asked if I wanted my money back. Rude! I sure do tho."}
{"text":"I occasionally been here in this location. I had bad service all the time. The servers are always in a mad mood and always rude. I really dislike the service at this location. Don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Called to order breakfast burritos and was asked to go to another location on Sunset. Wth? So I went anyway and decided to wait because it's on my way to work, and it took 20 to take my order, because the server new I was the one that called. How rude...never again!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, great food for the price. I usually order the California burrito with no sour cream. It gets the job done. The flour tortillas they use are the best though! Best place for late night eats around this area since there isn't much."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Carne asada torta is AMAZING! And their refried beans are amazing! Love that they are 24 hours AND have a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"From what i remember Roberto's being this place was not doing what it needs to be.  First off the service and everything else was good.  No complaints there. The sauce bar was a mess, cups everywhere and ladles in the sauce no thongs for the carrots or cucumbers.  Just a bad start right off the bat.  The food came out quick and was hot.  Another plus for fast food.  Then when i was really about to enjoy that first bite of my Carne asada burrito it hit me.  WAY TO SALTY. This was the same for my whole group.  The carnitas, carne asada fries, and the quesadilla.   I couldn't even finish. Sadly to say i was really looking forward to this location since it was right near the house and i will drive to Don Tortaco from now on."}
{"text":"If your searching for a quick mexican food spot I HIGHLY recommend Roberto's. ( a while back a lot of them changed to Lauritas) The menu didn't really change neither did the prices.  The have a large selection of items. My absolute favorite are the carne asada nachos. Those things will fill your life with joy and happiness. The rolled tacos are a solid chose as well. They come with sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, and tomato. The burritos are good as well. The horchata is always tasty here. Never flat or too milky.   For the kiddos I have ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans and that easily fed my 8 and 3 year old. The breakfast burritos are dangerously delicious. I seriously almost ate one and then ordered another one day. I was on a huge Roberto's kick for about a month and after stepping on the scale I quickly realized that I had to make some changes. SOOOOO with that said if your on a diet you may want to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Went to this Roberto's, ordered rolled tacos (cold and stale) 2 chicken taco's extra cheese (charged for cheese not received tacos dripping in oil) chili rellano (no flavor) shrimp buirrito (4 pieces of shrimp only) caramel churros (no caramel inside) all totaled $24. and change, now keep in mind I got my food to go as I was on my way home from work and had people at home waiting for food. I called the restaurant and advised of condition of food, they wanted me to bring it back (well I'm not giving them the opportunity to spit in my food after the attitude I rec'd on the phone) I advised them I did not live very close to that location and she said \"it's not my problem how far away you live), no resolution, I then sent an email to their corporate office and got no reply at all. This in my opinion is customer service at their very worst, so disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came to get a late night snack after walking around Las Vegas strip with a friend. The order was for 3 carne asada burritos and the #12 combo of 2 tamales.   They said the burritos were delicious and very well seasoned. My tamale combo was great! The red sauce that they poured over them had a very unique flavor.  I am not sure what they did differently, but I practicality licked the plate.  The next time I am in Vegas I will come back to eat here."}
{"text":"This is like \"FOOD HOME\" for a Vegan craving the ultimate veggie burrito. There Veggie burritos Vegan style is off the freaking hook...packed with flavor in every bite,leaving Vegans happy and satisfied, with what they just ate. This particular location will get your order right every time. You will leave here satisfied,that they got your order right,and it tasted so DAMN GOOD!!!keep up the good work...WOULD I EVER GO BACK??? \"Absofrnkinglotley\" AKA(Absolutely) like twice a week!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed at this location. Was happy that a new Roberto's opened and there was a drive thru and when I got my burrito it was just a beef burrito in a lukewarm Tortilla when I had originally ordered a California burrito. Mistakes happen and will definitely go back for another shot."}
{"text":"One question... when we order breakfast burritos with potatoes, why do we sometimes get potatoes inside and sometimes fries?!?! I don't want freaking french fries in my breakfast burrito!!"}
{"text":"This place always takes forever to order/get the food, it's like 10 mins per order! You would think that they are making it fresh since it takes so long. And they always get food order wrong, even when they repeat it back to you!! But it's still a Roberto and their food is alright."}
{"text":"Roberto's are all over the valley, but this location is particularly a favorite of mine because it's so convenient! Aside from the drive-thru, their parking lot isn't too crowded and being a newer location, the inside is very clean and organized. Their salsa bar is usually fully stocked and in great condition since they aren't as busy as other locations who have customers constantly making a mess. I've found the food at this location to be a little bit less greasy and not rushed to be made. The cashiers here are also very efficient so I've never seen the line backed up or customers disregarded in favor of taking phone orders."}
{"text":"Did not acknowledge me when I walked into the shop, and took forever to take my order. When they finally took my order. The server order food with gloves at the register and went back into the kitchen and started preparing food. Cross contamination and unacceptable for a restaurant. Always wash your hands whenever you prepare food or taking order at the register"}
{"text":"Literally the worst robertos in las vegas. Drive an extra few miles to another one.   Cashier was rude, double charged me and didnt want to refund me properly. Food was terrible and store was dirty."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location due to my addiction to Robertos shredded beef tacos and love of breakfast burritos however I've had to break up with them.  They seriously get me order wrong 75% of the time and now they are charging 50 cents on top to use my debit card.  It put me over the edge.  I'm done with you.  Plenty of other locations to choose from."}
{"text":"I had ordered tacos de adobada & my husband got a California burrito & it was super dry! it wasn't even appetizing at all we didn't even eat it & I am one to not waste food but we just couldn't.. I'm sorry but last time I go.."}
{"text":"So first off, me and my husband purchased carne asada nachos. We gave our 1 year old son some guacamole because he loves guacamole. It was the only thing we all ate that day, and very soon after eating we ALL feel nauseous and eventually we're all puking. My son had to go to the emergency room because he's so young, him puking was getting him dehydrated and is dangerous at his age. We all couldn't even keep water down. We spent a week in the hospital monitoring my one year old son because whoever made our food came to work sick with a virus or didn't store or handle food properly. So we finally leave the hospital with a doctors note (and our robertos receipt) for my son being sick from their food. Not only did i have to go through all of that but the employee STILL GAVE ME A HARD TIME Getting my refund back ! The employees name is BEATRIZ HERNANDEZ. Shes the rudest employee there and had NO empathy or compassion for What we just went through. She said Our doctors note wasn't specific enough for her. She refused to give me my refund, So i had to go get another doctors note. I came back and she STILL gave me a hard time ! They told me on the phone before i ever came to the store that i needed to talk to corrina. Both times i went they said corrina would be there but She WASN'T there either time. It seems like the beatriz lady was lieing because i told her im not leaving until she calls corrina on the phone so i can speak to her in order to get my refund back. Then after arguing for so long , all of a sudden i could finally get my refund back. I still never spoke to corrina. Just beatriz. Beatriz went to the back room alone to take pictures of my sons papers from the doctors and then said she had to keep my robertos receipt. That employee caused me to never want robertos ever again. You guys lost a good Customer and lots of money because my family and friends also loved robertos. But not anymore after i told everyone what happened. This is not acceptable and was very unprofessional of them. I talked to corporate. I will also be calling the health department on this location. NEVER go here..Unless you want to get sick AND have rude employees give you a hard time about something that was THEIR fault. Customer satisfaction should be the most important thing in running a business. Whoever runs this location seriously needs more training and also needs to have a long talk with their employees. ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food is always great but I do have some concerns about cleanliness. While I was there an employee was standing on an apron on the front counter washing the wall.  He had half his grimy shoe on the apron and half on the counter surface where you pick up your food. For some reason, the staff always seem to act a little passive aggressive. For example, you walk up to the counter and the staff will have a two or three minute conversation among themselves before greeting you. Another weird thing is they guard the paper napkins like they're bars of gold at Fort Knox. No napkins at the tables or salsa bar.  Overall four star food, two star service."}
{"text":"Roberto's is one of my favorite fast food Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Quick notes:  Open 24/7 One of the cleanest locations in town The supreme nachos are a personal favorite (get them in a to-go container).  Amazing spot... definite must try for those who haven't"}
{"text":"My burrito cost $9 what the heck I ain't going back the food ain't that good ,and I don't feel like getting the runs anyway hahahahah"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat there I get sick and now they raise the prices on their food looks like I'm going to Don tortaco from now on,true story.lol"}
{"text":"I love the Menudo here! I get random cravings for it on the weekends. The problem about this place is The menudo is the best thing here. The burritos and tacos are very average. Its good for late night hung over food but that's about it.  It also upsets me that there is a service charge for using a debit card, whats up with that?"}
{"text":"Really nice guy, didn't catch his name.   Probably the nicest staff at a Robertos yet, so far(in my opinion anyways)."}
{"text":"Hey look in the strip mall, it's a bird, it's a plane! No, it Roberto's Taco Shop.  These places are everywhere and I believe they are all open 24 hours.  So yes when you are having that Mexican food craving in the middle of night after some binge drinking you can always count on your friend Roberto to serve it up.  I'm not saying that's how I partake in this fine Mexican food establishment.  I actually frequent Roberto's quite often in a state of sobriety.  I only have four words for you, are you ready? yes four words that should be famously synonymous with Roberto's Taco Shop!  Wait for it.................! CARNE ASADA FRENCH FRIES!  Senor Roberto took two food items that I enjoy.  French fries and carne asada!  So next time you go to Roberto's Taco Shop at 12:00PM or 12:00AM, sober or inebriated just get the fries!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The closest thing you'll get to home cooked mexican food. They are always fast to get your order together. Never a long wait. Nice and clean place to eat."}
{"text":"So if their system is down they will just kick you out the door instead of taking cash payment and make your order! Went in late night around 2am by the time pull the door cashier already shouted \"system is down!\" \"What's that mean?\" I asked. \"Cannot order nothing?\" I continued. She nodded. But I also notice that some workers behind the counter and doing cleaning. So I hope it's not just an excuse to push away your customers. I'm always a fan of their burritos. 2 stars for that."}
{"text":"Always fresh and it would get 5 stars but this is not my favorite place for a bean and cheese and green chili burrito. Still very good though."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's because it always hits the spot for me when i have my mexican food cravings..  i always get the carne asada fries and carne asada burrito with everything in it BUT beans! (me and beans don't get along well)..   i also dig their pickled jalapeno and carrots.  The only thing i am not a fan of is how \"dive-y\" all of Roberto's feel when you walk in.. It has that \"hole in the wall\" feel to it.. or is it just me? And the condiment cart with the salsa sauces and pickled carrots, can be maintained a bit more.. but i'm not complaining, because I eat anyway.. lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I come in here quite often. So much that tonight when we came in Enrique remembered what we get. He always shows TOP QUALITY customer service. The food is ALWAYS on point and DELICIOUS!!! Enrique's service and the food is why Roberto's is the ONLY Mexican food we will eat. THANK YOU ENRIQUE for being awesome."}
{"text":"WORST TACO PLACE !!!!! First off the cook told me to F off because they didn't serve beer. On top of  that they place was really dirty and the cashier kept talking to her friend while I was trying to order"}
{"text":"This is not good authentic Mexican food at all. Tacos suck, rice is dry, place is dirty. Tasted like frozen Mexican food that was heated in the microwave and served."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to grab a \"snack\" in Boulder City. Perfect.   Food was ok. I was kind of dumb and ordered a 'platter' for a snack, so I had way too much food. (a beef burrito and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice.)  The food came up quickly, but the cheese in my enchilada was not melted. At all. I didn't want to make a fuss so I just ate it.  Burrito was ok - just meat, I think. The tortilla was really soft and chewy though.   Co-guests had tacos that looked good. I should have just kept to a 'snack'."}
{"text":"Laurita's.... This place is GROSS!! Not even 5 min after I wanted to throw up. I do not believe for a second things are made fresh. Maybe days old food their serving. I don't know about anyone else but I would rather wait 10 minutes for three tacos if that meant great savory and fresh cooked meat. My boyfriend had a California Burrito and he literally threw up. Yup we don't have the stomach for this kind of food. I live Mexican, hey Im Mexican but this food is a no go."}
{"text":"Price: $9.00 for 3 tacos.  Food Quality: Tortillas are hard, they put way too much onions on the tacos. They also did not have limes?!?!? Wow  I dont recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Don't ...lol just don't. I give them a chance every now and then cause they are close to my house but I always regret it. Waste of money honestly, the only good part is the salsa bar. If you want good Mexican food go to Rivas it's honestly the best Mexican food in Vegas.  Rivas uses quality meats and ingredients and everything on the menu is delicious especially if you like steak fries I promise eat there once and you'll never go back to Roberto's."}
{"text":"I don't see how anyone could rate this place above a 3. Carne asada was flavorless, and really killed any desire to return."}
{"text":"Chips, cheese and guacamole. At 3AM, it's all you really need. Well, a diet coke wouldn't hurt either."}
{"text":"A small restaurant, but a huge menu. The menu offers anything from the breakfast burrito to beef tongue tortas, menudo on the weekends. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. When my food was ready the cashier looked at me and gave me a head nod, uhhh... does she speak English? The restaurant is a bit uncomfortable, as the seating is wide open with just tables and chairs. I would definitely go back here for the food."}
{"text":"Gross. Just gross. I wanted to like this place, it came highly recommended by locals. But I cannot understand what they are all raving about. Greasy, slimy, overcooked, mess. One of the nastiest Mexican meals we've ever had and upset our stomachs for days.  The local Taco Bell has better reviews than this place, which I thought was hysterical, but now can understand why."}
{"text":"Like any other taco shop. What made me more mad is the discount only given to taxi drivers. Everyone in this complex discounts both taxi and limo. Not this place. Wont be going back or recommend it my passangers when they are looking for a fast place to stop before and afer airport"}
{"text":"I come here regularly, my family likes the chicken tacos, especially on taco Wednesday, the carne asada fries, & carne asada burritos. The food is always hot & the quality is always the same! My biggest complaint would be the wait in the drive through, I actually went here twice today, once around 1145a, there was 2 cars in front of me, the first pulled away shortly after I placed my order & the wait was close to 15 min. Then again around 5p, 4 cars in front of me, again the first pulling away within a minute of me pulling in, the wait was just over 20 min. And No, I don't typically go twice in 1 day, lol."}
{"text":"I remember always going to Roberto's Taco shop off of Nellis Blvd when it was attached to a gas station. Really good stuff and I even had friend's willing to drive all the way from The Strip just to get to it because it was so delicious. Can't say the same for this location.  The food was very filling but not very appetizing. The carne asada was a bit bland and though the al pastor was better, it could still use a bit more seasoning. The best thing the al pastor had going for it was the portion...the taco is stuffed with meat.  I also visited another location last year where the food was a little better than this location but didn't meet the standards of the Roberto's I mentioned early on. Therefore this leaves me to believe Roberto's is hit or miss depending on the location you visit.   Dinner 12/5/2015"}
{"text":"Took 20 mins to acknowledge a customer was waiting... then the employee decided it would be a great idea to give us attitude. Completely unacceptable behavior for ANYONE working at any food establishment. Did not bother giving them my money with a shitty attitude like that."}
{"text":"I had key word (HAD) been coming to this location for about 3-4 years. I had placed my order not just for myself. I requested a beef burrito wet. So excited and STARVING. I had a few bites and went to pour green salsa verde over the top of it. As I was pouring it. A green rubber band poured out with it. Not a big deal right?! Things happen. I'm guessing from veggies added to the salsa. Who knows? I call to inform the manager but it was the owner come to find out. By the name of Chris! He was EXTREMELY RUDE and defensive. Saying so what do you want me to do?! I then changed my tune. I made it VERY clear that I was just giving him a heads up. He said just bring the food back! Oooook! Nothing at all about apologizing. Polite?! Not a shot in dark! As I returned. \"Food still warm\" He was raising his voice in front of the restaurant and said here's your $. Mind you that was short too! He then proceeded to give me corporates #. And stated go right ahead! I don't care! That # is also a dead end road to a cell phone. HOW EVER MANY HE /THEY MAY OWN. They are absolutely AWFUL! Customer service doesn't exist. And from this Incident. I have made sure to share this and this location is in luck. I am a local hairstylist for 16yrs. Each and every friend and client I know WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION. 1 more thing, it's dirty inside and smells nasty!! Salsas etc. Were in warm water not over ice. STAY AWAY! I never complain but this was the worst service ever!!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here and the cashier who's name is Lulu was very mean and was not helpful at all. I'm not from around the area and as I was ordering she kept hurrying me up. I wasn't familiar with their menu and when I asked about what they offered she was very sarcastic pointing at the pictures on the wall as if I knew what they sold. She was impolite and seem to hate her job so much. They need better customer service because they will lose customers like me. I don't think it is worth coming to a place where I feel disrespected. I hope the management really takes this review to better their business."}
{"text":"Stopped here shortly after I left the airport. I got really lucky. Clean place, great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight after Trick or Treating with my daughter. I was starving and knew this would get me right. I ordered chicken enchiladas with an extra enchilada...Omg...first bite I felt something crunchy in my mouth and noticed a funny taste. Pulled it outta my mouth. It was bones and what look like shrimp shells. Spit the rest out of my mouth right in my napkin. Then I tried the second enchilada but this time I opened it to see what was inside. Saw some chicken and decided to taste it. I wasn't gone let my $10 go down the drain.. what a mistake, I couldn't even chew the chicken because it was so hard and again it tasted very weird. So I spit that out and took it apart to see what was inside. The small amount of chicken in my second enchilada was definitely not cooked all the way. It made me think about the third one. So since it was in a separate container I thought it would be different. NOT AT ALL. It tasted the worst of the two. It had this taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth. This was a waste of money and the worst it has ever tasted. I get this same combo everytime I go and it has never tasted like this before. I guess the trick was getting my money and the treat was horrible food! I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would it is so disgusting how greasy the food looks and how upsetting it is when you order to go . I got hard shell tacos and when I open the rapper there's grease everywhere it doesn't even look somewhat eatable there's grease everywhere literally dripping from the show the taste is horrible doesn't even taste like a taco but grease. And this is what we paid for ."}
{"text":"my roommate and i always come to this Roberto's because it appeared to be the nicest of all of them but unfortunately we both got a bad case of food poisoning after ordering the 3 rolled tacos. almost immediately did we begin to feel ill and it lasted 3 days after that. Just thought id share my experience! Be careful people!"}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY this place is open 24 hours! Because even though the food is not great, it is F'N AMAZING at 2 in the morning when you are coming home from parting with friends!  Or even better, have some lunch while you are having your car washed! Easy In-and-Out location, with a few tables out front.   Check out the specials board, there are a lot of great deals. But honestly, everything is pretty cheap! And the service is ALWAYS cheerful! The guys behind the counter are so great! And imagine what kind of drunk nonsense that have to put up with!...and yet, still smiling!"}
{"text":"Late Night , semi drunkin' food spot - HELL YES! For that - Perfect.  Amazing mexican food for you should travel for? Ya, not so much. Although I have heard the burritos are AMAZING, have not had one.  Eating a burrito at 2:30AM terrifies me! That is the only time I am here, so far.  Would I go back- ABSOLUTELY Would I make a special trip across the city. Nope.  But would I drive all the way over to \"Tacos El Gordo\" for ANY REASON? HELL YES I WOULD!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST thing about Roberto's is they are open late (this one is 24hrs!), and it is an easy place to grab some food after going to the clubs or bars.  The bad thing about Roberto's is the food is barely mediocre. The quesadillas are soggy, the tacos & burritos are meh.  But the service is always great! Service with a smile, no matter which Roberto's I have gone to in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok, let me tell you this: ANYBODY WHO RATED THIS PLACE 5 STARS COULD NOT HAVE EATEN AT AN AUTHENTIC TAQUERIA...EVER. Because if they did, they would have easily ripped this place. I mean, c'mon, they throw some so-so carne or what they call carnitas into a tortilla, throw a pinch of cilantro & spoon a little guac and call that a taco? The carne asada was salty and I've made better carnitas in the oven. They didn't even use the \"real\" chico tortillas and they were single, not doubled up, like every other taqueria I've ever been to in my whole life! The salsa bar was ehhh ok...I guess...But I just couldn't get over how half assed their tacos were. For a place that calls themselves a \"Taco shop\", I expected a helluvalot more. I guess it's cool that they're open 24 hrs, if you can't think of anywhere else to eat...At least the coconut paleta was good..."}
{"text":"The perfect drunk food or food in general after a night of clubbing. Especially the Carne Asada Nachos with a large Horchata. My other favorites are the Carne Asada Fries & Burrito, and Cheese Quesadilla."}
{"text":"If you are from Vegas then you already know the best chicken tacos are at Roberto's, always white meat. I always get at least two and drown them in the green sauce."}
{"text":"Decently priced and taste for Mexican fast food. Its not everyone's favorite but their are very few 24 hr restaurants open. This is one of them. Tacos are larger then most which explain why they are over 2 bucks. They also do a TACO Wednesday which I find weird. In California its Taco Tuesday for specials. I do love there Taquitos tho."}
{"text":"Tacos are tasty and big. Two should be enough to fill one up. Prices are good. They were fast and friendly and the place was kept clean."}
{"text":"2 stars because usually service and food at this location are spot on, but today placed a phone order on my lunch for my busy deserving staff. I arrived about 5 minutes later than my quoted pick up time, to find an Unengaged staff standing around, one even on her cell phone texting. I would assume that if they are not cooking that my order has been completed. no... I tell them I have a phone order... In which they all jump up and begin cooking my large order.   Usually when I place a food order, it is because my work is busy and I expect it to be ready in the amount of time I'm quoted. I'm usually pretty understanding if the employees look understaffed or busy with a rush. But today was a disappointment to both me and my staff that was hungry and awaiting my return."}
{"text":"Dang!! I would NOT go back here!!! The cashier was bland the first time I went here. Oh well, right? Second time I came here, the cashier (different one) was separating change, saw me, and looked back down until she had separated all $7.62 of the dimes and nickels someone had paid with. Okay, fine.  I told her my order in English (six breakfast burritos- two potato, two ham, two bacon). Then she gave me a death stare and asked what kind. I didn't get a \"hello\" or \"thank you\" or \"please sign here\" when she put my credit card receipt on the counter and walked away. I had asked her for pico, which she didn't ring me up for, and then she tried charging me $7 for pico, which comes in free-flowing abundance in other places. Forget that noise.  Also, I used to work in a Spanish-speaking kitchen when I was younger, so to hear the cashier and cook talk trash about me while I was waiting for my food is totally uncalled for. I suppose if you don't speak any Spanish and can tolerate surly angst from a $4 burrito joint, it's still possible to go there when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I've been to a really dirty Roberto's (the one on Craig next to Nellis AFB,) and the expression \"dirty Roberto's\" just sounds... terrible. This particular shop was very clean in the morning, and the cashier was wonderfully warm.   Massive breakfast burrito that can feed you for three days straight- or so it seems- for about $5. Load up on your own salsa and pickled condiments, but pico gonna cost you extra- this ain't Texas.   Food is straight forward but hot and satisfying... Sounds like a lot of things in Vegas."}
{"text":"Beef was so fresh. Nice authentic tacos from this gringo. Only regret is that I had a Jersey Mikes sub just before."}
{"text":"Roberto's...   Had a few beers?   Want something to fill that belly at 3 am?  It's delicious, it staves off hangovers, it fills you up, it's cheap. It does it all...   Roberto's steak quesadilla... order it with pico de gallo (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc) and get some of those jalapenos they have at the mini bar. Don't worry that it looks like a sad salad bar... who cares!?!?!  This is budget Mexican at it's best. Get the peppers, get the sour cream, get the steak quesadilla (extra steak)... Put it all together and YUM!  No hangover, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"2 stars was the average for this place and it's pretty accurate. Got burritos and the cheese was cold. Not even melted.   Definitely drunk food and should not be eaten sober.   Sorry but I was disappointed. I expected something way more authentic."}
{"text":"This Robertos is probably my favorite in town. They do everything we ask and they are quick and it's just tasty. It doesn't have that old grease taste like some have. They are always so polite, the veggie bar is always stocked proper and it's usually very clean :) I'm glad it's right around the corner from my house cause I would take the drive to this one vs others in town."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap, hangover food, can't really complain, lived their shrimp burrito, chimichanga is also amazing."}
{"text":"It's a Robertos, what do you want? When you're craving the cheap Mex on the go it's good. Tonight is carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"Terrible location. Dirty. When I went the owners children were in the kitchen eating and running around. Got home to find a toothpick cooked into my rolled taco. Got a refund but still very disgusted. I drive a little extra to go to a cleaner location."}
{"text":"By far my favorite location. It is newer and really nice. I call in my orders and they are ready to go. Staff is nice and friendly. Location is very clean and well put together!"}
{"text":"Love this location!  They have a drive thru which is amazing and convenient. They are always fast, friendly, and on point!  The inside is so so so clean and well kept!! Salsa bar is always full and fresh.   Women working the counter was extremely friendly and did not stop working.   Overall I totally recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, food is good, salsa bar is always in good shape when I come  They have dollar tacos on Wednesday and I used to come to this location every week."}
{"text":"The food quality here is really good, and they are usually pretty fast. However, for the location of this Roberto's, the inside is way too small and it's hard for the employees to hear you sometimes because it gets packed and the kitchen is already loud. It does take quite a while to get orders on Taco Wednesdays because a lot of UNLV students have found out about the deal. The salsa bar is really difficult to get to when it's busy and it gets messy really fast which is kind of off putting. Overall though, it's fine for carry out if you don't mind awkwardly standing in the middle of the restaurant while the sun is blazing in on you making you feel like you will also be a chicken taco soon."}
{"text":"The people at this Roberto's are very friendly and fast. They have always gotten our order right even if it was complicated. Their salsa bar is always in good shape. It seems like the store is always clean, the worst thing I've seen is a sticky table. It seems like they're usually pretty busy around dinner time (5-7). The food always comes hot and tastes good too."}
{"text":"I go to this location almost weekly because its near my house and my other half loves the breakfast burritos they make here. I have had good experiences with the food served, its the condition of the store- cleanliness wise, that I have an issue with. The floors are usually sticky along with most of the table tops. The windowsills are dusty. The salsa bar is in need of more ice and a good wipe down. The soda machine is a sticky mess and dusty on top as well. If the place is open 24hours, there should be some down time to clean the store. So, I will still continue to eat at Roberto's but I hope the kitchen and prep area are not in the same condition as the dining room."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Nachos for the kids and they loved it! They load the toppings and give plenty of food. Our 4 kids shared one nacho plate and we still had lots leftover. Also tried the Adobada Fries and that was just as good as the Chicken Nachos."}
{"text":"If you want decently priced mexican food, this is place to go to. Roberto's Taco shop is all over the vegas and you will find them close to your neighborhood no problem. Additionally, they are open 24hrs which is also awesome if you have a crave during middle of the night.   Food is decent. I would give 3.5/5 However, it could a bit more sanitary though. Overall, not bad!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's location by far. The service here is pretty good, and the shop itself is always very clean. It's definitely not my favorite \"Mexican\" choice, but it works if you're looking for quick takeout and of course, 24 hour service. I love the bar where you can grab as much spicy pickled jalapeno/carrot/onion mix and cucumbers with salsa as you wish. The burritos are huge, and extra spicy if you prefer. My fav is the shrimp burrito, stuffed with large shrimp and tons of onions/peppers. The tortillas are delicious. A popular item is the carne asada fries ... worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious Carne Asada fries! So good i finished all of them. Very clean for a 24 hour restaurant. My fiances fries were too greasy but not mine thats why 3 stars instead of 5. Also the agua de pina was plain no bueno."}
{"text":"It was good but the restaurant seemed a little messy. The tables weren't cleaned while I was there and they were set up really awkwardly. The food was good but one of the things we ordered came a lot later than the other so my friend basically ended up finishing his food before me. I understand that certain things take longer to make than others but it wasn't the lunch hour and we both ordered pretty standard burritos, nothing special. Other than that, the food was fine."}
{"text":"Ah, I miss the delicious crispy chicken tacos so much! Shredded white meat, perfectly season, fried in a corn tortilla until it is crisp but still tender and topped with cheese and lettuce. Can't find anything like it in California. Definitely stop here if you're in town. Great service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"I came here expecting a nice time because this place was highly recommended by my coworkers. The food is average but the customer service is horrible! The lady taking my order had an attitude and a thick accent getting annoyed with me for not understanding. I tried to be polite at first and understand but she was just being rude. I felt like my presence wasn't wanted when I did nothing wrong. Either teach your employees to be patient and nice when customers can't understand or hire people who can speak English since there are non Spanish speaking customers. I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"ver afraid of the hole in the wall Mexican restaurants? Afraid of the taco runs? Well, fear no more! In various areas of Vegas lies a hole in the wall place called Roberto's taco shop. It's small, the waiters hardly speak English, and the kitchen is spotless.  My friends, Sheila and Kim, went to grab a few tacos for lunch. I haven't tried Mexican food since arriving to Vegas in fear of the terrible stomach pains legendary of cheap taco places. I decided to take the jump and ordered some need tacos and nachos with cheese. Being naïve, I expected taco bell portions. To my surprise, I was wrong.  Roberto's is a great place to grab authentic Mexican food. Shredded need or chicken in a freshly fried homemade taco shell and killer salsa verde, it was the best I've ever had since guam. Their nachos have fresh cheese melted on them, and the portions are huge.  Take time to visit the small places. Like Roberto's' you'l find amazing places to eat. I give them my personal 5 out of 5 stars. Sent via BlackBerry by AT&T"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse customer service at this location, I've been trying to look at  (\"Elsa Marada\" female personnel at the register) her customer service an attitude as she was just having a bad day but I've been going to this location getting the same menudo for the past year and she's had the same rude attitude even on the phone she sounds lifeless as if she doesn't want to answer the phone I ordered some menudo to pick up and I requested no bone brought it home it had more bones than menudo so I had to go back and for some reason she felt the need to check it with a glove and a spoon and had to redo it her attitude the whole time was as if I was bothering her! I will never return back to this location they just lost a very loyal customer!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to see one that was 24 hours, close to my house. My friends from out of town stopped by at 3am. Nothing was ready. No beans, No rice. My buddy who was vegetarian had no more options, but just cheese quesadilla. I was embarrassed for bringing them here, but their prices keep skyrocketing, far above other taquerias around town.   These are all family owned and operated like In N Out. But there's no quality control, what so ever. I've been to good Roberto's and bad Roberto's. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for burritos for YEARS. I'm talking 5 stars as far as taco joints go. Then last week, I saw the cook use the spatula to finish up my carnitas, right after he had just used the same spatula to put raw meat on the griddle!!! I have friends who are chefs and they would be FIRED for doing exactly that in most restaurants. Cross contamination isn't taken lightly by me and I will NEVER give Roberto's food to my kids.  ** I've contacted Roberto's and they wrote back saying they'll take care of it. Whatever that means.  As for the food, they give you a lot of bang for the buck. Machaca burrito or torta has shredded beef with two fried eggs in it. It's loaded with guacamole and it's only $3.50. Their condiment bar is loaded with pickled jalapeños & carrots, lime, green onions, radishes, cucumbers, salsa verde & roja. It's kept clean and fresh.  One of Roberto's sons once told me that this Roberto's is their busiest, hence it's open 24 hrs and is very clean. That's why I was shocked to see what I saw in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Love this robertos.  I come here for lunch probably weekly.  The girl who has been working day time there for a while is such a sweetheart!  She always knows my order too!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like some rolled tacos to full the stomach on my way home from a night of debauchery.  Roberto's is just around the corner of my house. The food is good, the staff is friendly, (even in English isn't their strong point), and the salsa bar with cucumbers is a nice touch  There are better places to eat Mexican in vegas, but late night it's hard to find anywhere better Mexican than Robertos"}
{"text":"Alberto's and Roberto's are my favorite taco shops in Southern California to find one in Las Vegas was a treat until I ate here, I will not be back"}
{"text":"Don't eat at this location. Super dirty, the guy working the window is only friendly if you're Spanish speaking. Never again.  The same guy just sprayed windex on the inside of the glass that the sides are in....without taking the sides out first. Good luck to whoever eats that. Windex carrots and everything else. Terrible this needs a health inspection"}
{"text":"Well, when I went into this place I did not know what to expect... I walked in and holy cow this place was so not mexican food. I should have expected not authentic duh... But nope. This place is like a fast food version of taco bell hahaha, or a fast food version of Baja Fresh. I ordered a burrito the meat was the only real good part of it. The rice and beans were dull to say the most. Plenty of parking, but the place inside is clean, clean bathroom, but boring colors inside. Weird because it has a lot more of these little stands everywhere here. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break into Mexican food and then go to little mexican places after this then to the big boys."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, but not anymore.   They raised the prices to the point of insanity. It's basic Mexican food...not fine dinning!!! The prices have gone up close to 35%!!!"}
{"text":"I have had the taco salad at least 5 times. I love it with just the veggies and beans. I try to stay as healthy as possible so if I indulge I try to still make it the best I can.  HOWEVER, the carne asada fries are just plain incredible. If you are trying to eat healthy this is not the way to go. I have to allow myself a cheat day and if I go to Robertos for that day you can guarantee those fries will be on my order!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's in town!  The staff is always friendly and very quick!  Best food too!"}
{"text":"Fish burrito tastes like rotten fish! And I had this when I was starving! The green sauce is too liquidy and not spicy at all. Needs more flavor. Red sauce was fine."}
{"text":"We met some friends here for lunch on our way out of town. I had the crunchy chicken tacos. The two people I asked about military discount did not understand enough english to comprehend what I was asking them so I am not sure if they give discounts or not.  The chicken was so dry that the ends of the shredded chicken were too hard eat. I couldn't eat the taco shells they were hurting my teeth just trying to bite into them. Was scared to chew them. The employees seemed nice. Should most likely have at least one person working the front that can understand english a little more.   MILITARY DISCOUNT=unsure"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Roberto's in the area.  Its the nearest one to where I currently live so we would go out of convenience. Being that it's a Roberto's the food is basically the same as anywhere else but for some reason getting what you actually ordered is a challenge.   They charge a $1.10 to add guacamole to an item and on 3 separate occasions I got home and they had neglected to add it even though I had paid for it. I initially shrugged it off and didn't want to get all bent about the situation but it definitely got on my nerves.  The next time I went in I made sure to tell them about the guac situation and this time they included it but still charged me despite their 3 past screw ups. I thought, alright fine it's just a dollar.  A few days later we returned for breakfast burritos. Took the order home and they had put the wrong meat inside of one of them. I don't know how Carne Asada gets confused with Shredded Beef - and in a breakfast burrito nonetheless. Gross combination.   At that point it was clear that they are simply too incompetent to get a to-go order done correctly. A mistake or two is understandable but this is just ridiculous. It happened time after time, consecutively. I shouldn't have to babysit them while they make the damn food to make sure they are doing their jobs correctly.   I have never had this issue at the other location I used to frequent and though it is a longer drive I will be going back to the old location.   Don't waste your time and money on this Roberto's. They are sloppy and careless. They don't pay attention to what they are doing, especially at 1am when the place is dead and they aren't even busy (which is usually when we would go). No thanks."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. I always get the #6 .. staff is friendly. Atmosphere is not taken into account as I come here for a quick bite not to \"dine\" ... tables are clean."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for two reasons.... 1. There is no drive-thru here 2. It's 24hr (are all Roberto's 24hr?)  So, know that if you come here, you have to leave your car (gasp!), but their doors will always be open (there aren't many 24hr 'fast food' joints open in this area). This particular location is clean and has about 10 tables inside. I've never seen more than 2 tables being used. Taco Tuesday is $1 beef tacos (max 12).   That being said, it's Roberto's. It tasted just like every other Roberto's. You can find a better version of everything on their menu somewhere else in this city. The question is, can you find it at 3am..."}
{"text":"Out of all the robertos that I've been to over here, for a 24hr joint it wouldve been ok. OMG!! We had to come back bcuz Cashiergirl couldn't hear I guess bcuz she gave us a chicken taco combo instead of 3 CHICKEN TACOS!! And my chile relleno combo was this little chile! I guess I'm CALI/SF/MISSION SPOILED! Aaaand I wish they made shrimp tacos. Also, I Wish they delivered as well. Oh I also have to add that when came back to exchange our WRONG order, that girl was sweeping while they had customers there eating!! Now who or wtf, shud there b sweeping while paying customers are tryin to enjoy for WUT they pay for? Also, as we entered the store, that girl AAAAND the cook had attitude AAAND that cook starting sayin some shit to cashier girl & one of them words was \"CABRONE\" Sooo unprofessional! Now wtf shud they b mad? Aaaand she tried to put me in check by eased dropping on my conversation bcuz I was wondering if I'm getting some money difference from this and that's wen she spoke up n loud \"oh u don't get nothing. And from that & being called a CABRONE..... SOMEBODY BETTER CALM ME THE FUNK DOWN! And I swear, they better not have messed with our taco/tacos like Putting some nasty stuff in our food! I'm thinking like this due to the unprofessional rudeness she & the cook gave us on our return!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good size and tasty. Of course al pastor was the best.  We tried shrimp burrito, bad idea.  Just tomato sauce with white rice and 4pc of shrimp. Not tasty at all. Lack of creativity.  The men's restroom was bad. All tagged, nasty and no paper towel.  The pickled veggies were dry and obviously old.  Probably no for next time"}
{"text":"Chimi's are fantastic.  It suits the craving for hot fresh made mex."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries and nachos from Roberto's are the best padding for drinks. Plus, they're delicious.  Thanks to my local Vegas friend for the pickup and delivery service!"}
{"text":"I've been frequently eating take out from this taco shop for the past year and it was very good food. However, the last two times in recent weeks, I ordered a Chile  Relleno burrito and found the Chile Relleno to be half the size of the burrito. On previous occasions, the Chile's were 3/4 of the burrito. I think that $7.50 for rice/ beans and small Chile is rather high. I'm hoping that this was an error by the cook and not by management."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of Roberto's food to begin with but I got the worst food poisoning from this location.  So unless you don't mind being up all night shaking, puking & sh!tting your brains out, don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"The best burritos in Las Vegas not to mention the loaded carna asada fries OMG!!!!! Just like your local taco trucks this place has it all and they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Food is decent but customer service from the girl that works the cashier is horrible. Everytime I go in there she is rude and looks pissed off. I noticed a difference in how she greets and interacts with others depending on race and/or gender. She charged me a fee to swipe my debit card also which I don't ever remember having to do before. Though its probably the cleanliness out of all locations, I try to avoid coming to this location solely because of service."}
{"text":"Since it's a chain, I would think they use the same products.  I am only reviewing the quality of the carne asada that they use in their burritos. It is very poor quality.  Way too much fat.  Tried it twice.  Hate having to pick the fat out of my mouth.  Clean it better.  Whatever Fausto's does, do the same. They have great quality carne asada.  Kick it up guys."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos!! The breakfast burritos hit the spot after a long night shift or in the morning! The establishment is a bit worn but the food is still good. The best part is they are open 24hrs."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Mexican food. The wait time is not too bad even when there are only 2-3 employees present.  The food is always up to par; burritos taste like burritos, quesadillas taste like quesadillas, etc. Although the food is not absolutely amazing, it all still tastes great. There is also a complimentary salsa bar. There is a huge menu with daily specials, breakfast items, and desserts as well.  On my last visit here, I had a chicken burrito plate, which consisted of a chicken burrito, a side of rice, and a side of refried beans. Everything tasted like it was supposed to. Everything came nice and hot. The amount of food for the value of the meal makes it a great buy.  There is not a lot of parking here, but there is always some place to sit. There is a 50 cent charge for any credit/debit cards as well. This place is worth a visit for some good-quality, Mexican food."}
{"text":"Today was the first time we went to this location. We ordered the Carne  asada  fries and a Carne asada burrito. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. And the food was good. Usually at other locations the Carne  Asada fries  are a little on the greasy  side , but not today we ate all our Carne  asada fries   they were perfectly crispy,  cheesy and Definitely  not greasy . My burrito was awesome made special to order (because sometimes I can be difficult like that) I give this place a four  out five stars. Would of been five  stars if the place didn't smell so much like cigarette  smoke so much,  it was very unappealing."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in the drive thru. 15 minutes now and only two cars have been served (and they weren't very big orders). Every time I come here I wait a ridiculous amount of time. This has got to be the slowest \"fast food\" place ever."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start this off by saying I frequent this Roberto's to the point I feel the graveyard guys know my face. I went through the drive thru tonight 3/25 at roughly 2:45 am. I ordered what I always do carne asada fries and a large pina. Over the mic the guy says $13.64 more or less, I pull up to the window and repeats the same amount hands me the fries and drink I hand him two $10 bills. Asks if I'd like more sauce I get a few more red sauces and hands me $1.30 back I pull off thinking nothing of it I didn't even leave the parking and pulled back through and explain that he handed the wrong change back he replied no, no, no I asked if I could have a receipt which I had not received I got no response. I pulled to the window and no one was in sight. THIS LOCATION TOOK MY MONEY KNOWING WHAT THEY DID! I am very displeased and need a response from management not cool at all."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Try taco's el Gordo."}
{"text":"Hungry late at night? Taco 'bot a good meal here at robertos! I enjoy getting lingua (cow tongue) fries with extra meat, fries well done. Pina juice, fried onions, and I take a few limes, radishes, cucumbers, and little cups of salsa. Then my hubby and I share and it's a happy ever ending meal! MmmmMm!"}
{"text":"Had a beef chimi at robertos a few nights ago, I was really hungry and its a lot of food. It was perfect and filled me up. The prices at robertos are awesome, the food hasn't disappointed me ever! And the service is usually spot on. Only waited a couple minutes, and they let me customize the chimi and sides just the way I wanted it which is huge for me (I don't like lettuce or tomatoes on anything!!!) Quick in and out transaction, food was really good, and its location and price is good for me.  4 solid stars"}
{"text":"Wow...what a shame! I've always loved the beef rolled tacos from Roberto's. I live less than two minutes from this location but after so many chances this is the final straw, I'd rather drive the distance than eat at this location. There's literally few strands of beef in the rolled tacos!  We've been a strong supporter of Roberto's, you guys can do better than this!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! It smells like cigarette from the gaming center next door! They don't even have a wall that divides both places it's just a door. Later on when I got home, THE FOOD SMELLED LIKE CIG!!!  Disgusting, horrible customer service, guy just chills in the back and after 10 minutes of waiting with nobody else in the restaurant; he finally walks up and stares at me, doesn't even ask me if I have questions or if I'm ready to order. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Near the airport and open 24/7. We'd just gotten back to the hotel and were searching for food nearby. At 8:30pm there wasn't much other than fast food, so this seemed like a good idea.  After filling up at a buffet earlier in the day, I wasn't very hungry. So I ordered what I thought would be a small meal - a chicken taco and a shredded beef tostada. Oh my gosh! It was plenty of food! I liked the tostada. It was huge. It came in its own box and was covered with beans, lettuce, peppers and onions. The beef was tasty and tender. The chicken taco was so-so, but honestly I just ate the tostada and had enough.   The best part? The salsa bar! The red salsa was so spicy, but I poured green all over my food. And the carrots- the best."}
{"text":"**Review only on the Horchatta***  Came here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station.   We went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.  My horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"This place awesome open 24 hours bomb Mexican food. We were staying locally and wished we found it sooner."}
{"text":"I am a community member of aliante so I like to give all community base companies a shot before going out of my area. However, this place is a disappointment. I ordered some enchiladas a while back and the cheese wasn't melted so I decided to order again and asked them to melt the cheese they told me in so many words they don't do that \"WHAT\"! I guess they wanted me to stop coming to every franchise they had in Vegas. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came to this location after work at 12:30am and ordered the menudo. I work far from home so by the time I got home to finally eat I was disappointed. The menudo they make here is wayyyy wayyy to spicy. Remind u I love spice but not when it burned my tongue even minutes after drinking a big glass of milk. So disappointing. When I called to ask them why they said that's how they make it there. they said I can bring it back for my money back but I live 25 min away. What a waste of money now I have to stop somewhere near by n grab something I can actual eat and enjoy. Smh."}
{"text":"Food is good but too greasy. I ordered two chicken tacos and they were so greasy a hole was formed in my bag. Also, I went through the drive through and the cashier took too long with my debit card. I asked if there was a problem and she said. Ill definitely Pay with cash next time."}
{"text":"Food was great, no complaints there. However the management needs to inform the staff(and be informed) of Federal and State ADA law pertaining to service animals. I brought my dog in(fully trained service animal) and set him down by our table an went to the counter to order. First, the cashier asked if he was my dog and i said yes, and then she asked if i had a \"card\". First of all, it is ILLEGAL to request any documentation for service dogs. Second, private parties can purchase service dog certifications and cards online. It is also illegal to have a dog out in public identified as a service dog that is not fully trained.  There are only two question staff are allowed to ask patrons with service animals. 1) Is the dog a service animal required cause of a disability? 2) What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?   You cannot require documentation, you cannot require that the dog perform its task, and you cannot inquire about the nature of the persons disability.  http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.pdf"}
{"text":"The food was good until my husband nearly chipped his tooth biting a washer that was in his chimichanga. Otherwise would've given 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband had gotten food from this establishment for me - after picking out all the veggies I had asked NOT to have on it, I found a beautiful black curly hair in the middle of my food. I promptly called to see if I could get credit for my next purchase; in broken english they told me I had to bring in the food AND the hair to get another nacho, which could only be received the same day (and didn't apologize either). Needless to say, I didn't have much of an appetite for nachos after that. My best advice: instead of just wearing hats, you need to add some gloves to that equation - specially when you have a bunch of men with hairy arms and hands working with food (DUH)!!!!!!!  GROSS"}
{"text":"I go to Roberto's at least once a week.  Good reliable tacos... love em..."}
{"text":"Love the late night midweek cook here.  The cleanliest Roberto's I've been to EVER.  I always tip them here because they work hard, understand English & they are always pleasant people at the counter.  Give them a smile & they smile back. I hate when I smile & I get death stare. That's what keeps us coming back.  You can tell a lot from an establishment when the employees are cleanly, cheerful & don't mind if you want more.  They're happy to be working and they remind me of myself when I started out in the fast food industry.  I feel like they go above & beyond, as I did for my regulars. You show me respect I give it back, plus a tip. :D  Probably the cleanliest fast food place I've ever been to. During the afternoon is the best time to go.  My Boyfriend usually gets Carne Asada Quesadilla only cheese.  I have a moderate allergy to Wheat so I grab the Carne Asada Cheese fries, only refried beans, steak and cheese.  I hate the avocado, pico de gallo & sour cream. It makes the fries soggy. yuck.  Those of you that don't tip shame on you. :( Whip out your phone calulator & take the Total multiply by .15"}
{"text":"I wanted something for a fast breakfast and thought of coming here since we live off Hualapai Way. The first thing I dislike about this location you can't watch them grill the food (like the Rainbow and Sunset location).  I ordered my usual bacon breakfast burrito and came home to find they put french fries in my burrito instead of the cubed potato from off the grill.  So I called and told them there's a mistake, I think the young man with glasses that took our order answered. At first, he was apologetic.  I said Hola and handed him the takeout bag.  He brings it to the back to the cook and then he's looking for me and I had stepped aside out of courtesy of other customers.  He looks for me and I approached the counter and says there were potatoes in there, I said yes but there FRIED.  He starts raising his voice at me, sticks his chest out and says, \"That's how they come!\".  My heart was pounding at this point, I felt he was being completely rude.  I didn't even get a chance to explain anything, he was talking over me.  My boyfriend walks up from behind me after he parked the car.  He asked the young guy WHO he was talking to with an attitude? This kid says I don't \"got\" an attitude in a calm soft voice, shakes his head and then ROLLS HIS EYES.  I said to him you just raised your voice to me, nothing for an apology. He escalated the situation for no reason.  All the customers are starring by now and so are the employees.   I'm glad my boyfriend came with me.  I honestly can't have long french fries out of the deep fryer because I have a corn ALLERGY and that's why my food had not been eaten. I take my allergy meds to avoid the hives and being hospitalized, I take it very seriously.  The cooks at the other location have always cooked the food in front of me on the grill and it's cubed/square potatoes, not long french fries. They just tried to cut corners and that would have been a big mistake.  Anyway, a young lady employee whom I've met before sees what's happening, she de-escalated the situation by returning our money since he couldn't handle speaking to me like a normal human being. This place is always hit or miss, I just rather not bother coming here when they raise prices and tried embarrassing me in front of other customers. We ended up going to Cracked Egg at Rainbow & Sunset for a real breakfast $4 more. Leave your attitude at home. There are 5 other BETTER taco shops in a 1-2 mile radius, there's no need to make me feel so little!  UPDATE: I didn't notice until now the receipt on our end table says his name is Rolando.  Alejandra was the young woman who helped us."}
{"text":"I have been to this Roberto's alot and I always get the same thing carne asada burrito...I wanted to try something different so I got the carne asada torta. It was a good size and looked amazing...when I went to pick up the bottom was mush...saddd. the top was nice and crisp and buttery so I just disassembled and ate how I could. I won't be getting again back to my old fave."}
{"text":"The Meat and Potatoes on Roberto's Taco Shop in Las Vegas NV - Yes, Yes, Yes I have been to a Roberto's in San Diego, CA did not know they had others, but I was in need of some food coming back from a night out with the kids and saw this 24Hr Roberto's in a strip mall. My mind went back to the Carne Asada Fries I tried in San Diego...... So good. So all the kids ordered those, I had the #4 combo with 2 taco's as well as an 3rd taco. Fries come out and the Carne is seasoned and grilled to perfection, Man these can't be good for you, but taste so good. The Taco's were to be honest just ok. The meat in both of them fell a bit flat next to the Carne on the fries.  The woman taking the orders and the cook were very nice and welcoming, even with it being so late at night. Did I mention this location is open 24hrs.    Ambiance 3/5 Food 4/5 Drink 3/5  Service 4/5 Overall Experience 3.5/5 Till next time Drink, Eat, and Enjoy this life you live - Groux"}
{"text":"Unlike the other Robertos in the city this Robertos is consistently good.   Good things to order ; Chicken quesadilla  Carne Asada quesadilla Carne Asada fries Chicken tacos  Breakfast burritos  None of the above has ever failed me"}
{"text":"If your drunk you can come here. I mean, it's greasy and taste a LITTLE better then Taco Bell. But not by much. It's fast. It's greasy. The people are nice that work there?"}
{"text":"The food was mostly good, but my experience could have been better. I ordered a California burrito with guacamole. About 1/3 of the way through my burrito, I found two pieces of inedible fatty meat but no guac. I politely asked if they had put it in and the cook said yes. While I believed him, I shouldn't have to all if the guacamole I paid an extra dollar for was there or not (I found a trace amount towards the last couple bites). The cashier was super friendly and offered top give me more, but the cook shot me a nasty look. I'll do without the attitude, thanks."}
{"text":"So it looks like from the other reviews I've had a pretty decent experience every time I've been here! Being that this is the closet location to me and the limited amount of food that is available in the late hours Roberto's is always my 1st choice! Carne Asada fries are a hit!! I usually get the nachos but them chips are extremely fried and hard! Even though As far as calories are concerned the fries are more.. But who's counting calories right?? RIGHT! Service for the most part is what it is.. If you don't speak Spanish at least know how to communicate the # of your item! They definitely nickel and dime you for every one of the extras and it's expensive for just a regular burrito once you finish trying to add in all the extras and substitutes! Portions are always equal to what you pay for! That's why the nachos or fries are the best! Seems everytime I go though the prices increase!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Roberto's!  Each time the food has been great and haven't had a complaint about the food.  Why 3 stars?  The last time I visited, I ordered food for the whole family and went on my way home.  When I got home, my wife wanted a bite of the chicken fries and much to our surprise, they had given us chicken nachos.  We were happy to find out the issue before too long.  I drove back to the shop as it is close enough to us, but the guy didn't seem too happy to fix the issue since it was apparently my fault.  After going back and forth about the change needed to be made, we were still charged the additional amount for the chicken fries.  Will we keep going here?  Most likely, but I guess we need to make sure we are as clear as possible when ordering the food."}
{"text":"I have not had any issues with this Roberto's as the food has always been correct and delicious.  I mostly stop by this shop while at work for either breakfast burritos or chicken taco Wednesday."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop locations can either be a hit or a miss when it comes to getting some quality service and food! This location just happened to be on my little short cut way that I took home last night. Hungry as I was I knew at the time of night it was I shouldn't be eating no damn Roberto's but whatev.. Thankfully when I arrived it wasn't busy at all and I was able to order right away. Now I always like to look around at the cleanliness of the place to ensure that it up to par! This has to be by far one of the most clean locations I've visited! One thing that I hate is visiting a location that has a filthy salad bar with all the sauces mixed up and the jalapeño soaked carrots everywhere. They obviously keep a close eye on the lobby and make sure it's neat! One thing I also noticed was the constant hand washing!! Yes yes yes I love it lol my order of the breakfast burrito with bacon came out in a timely manner. Now I'm usually a carne asada fries/burrito guy but some many tips for that breakfast burrito I had to see what the hype was about! And yes there's plenty hype! For $4.60 you can't beat that nice size burrito! I found my new favorite location!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Fries!!!!That's all you need to order lol This seriously is the best dish aside from the carne asada burrito! I moved from Las Vegas to the South and I'll tell you what i miss this place!!"}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shop just simply isn't what it use to be. I feel like based on my last visit which happened to be at this particular location, I had an epiphany.. you know like one of those \"AH-HA\" moments of why it is that I'd went so long without eating any food from them. The quality definitely lacks more than what I remember, that's for SURE!   After a fun night hanging out at the Hard Rock with my friends after a concert we were of course hungry and needed to soak up all that liquor from drinking. Who doesn't want a 1,000 plus calorie meal to feel better right? Oh and to have this place be so conveniently located right across the street there was no hesitation at all. Located right on the corner of Harmon & Paradise Rd you will find them in the Harmon Square. When we arrived it was busy and they only had one cashier who obviously hated her job.. just rude for no reason and shouldn't have been the face of the company that night but that's a different story so I'll move on....  Let's address these prices... Now Mr. Roberto.. Are you for real? I need you to get it together because since WHEN did the carne asada fries come up to $10.77?! I remember the good ole days when these use to be like one of the best bang for your buck options of what to order because it was so much food for a reasonable price. I'm just not seeing these price increasing warranting the taste of what is being delivered. My carne asada fries weren't as delicious as what I know they can and have made right in the past. Then the facts kick in on how much they cost now which made them taste even worse. Bottom line is I really think I'm calling it quits with Mr. Roberto. There are far more better Mexican fast food joints around Las Vegas and even though they may not be 24hrs I still will choose them over this place."}
{"text":"Okay so this is probably like my favorite Roberts to go to!! The carne Asada fries are like a forbidden fruit to me.. I know I shouldn't be eating them but I get them.. And eat the whole thing! Terrible! But oh well it shouldn't be so damn good! The service is always very fast and friendly! If it gets to the point where they know you by name then.. Yes you are officially a Roberts taco shop addict like me :-) anyways if You are in the area and want a quality Roberts to visit this is your place! My only thing is that these particular items on the menu have went up and they will definitely nickel and dime you for all of the normal things that should come on a burrito or whatever else such as sour cream, guacamole, cheese etc! Your lucky if you get the damn limes and lemons for free! Other than that it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Roberto's I've ever been in. My favorite is the Carne asada chips. This is a place I will always come back to for Mexican food. I even come here just for sour cream."}
{"text":"Excellent. Clean place. The food is delicious. I love their carnitas and carne asada the best!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell what??!!! Those two words aren't even in my vocab when it comes to this place!! Great authentic Mexican food at good prices and open 24hrs!! Love the rolled tacos and the California Burrito is too good for words!! Tamales are the best you can get if you can't wait til your best friends Latin feast at their house during Christmas:-)"}
{"text":"After a night drinking, which is like every night basically, i do try to stay on the slim side but honestly... we are in the US and slim is not really a typial american trade now is it?  Anyways, thank god for this great country to allow us to be freaking fat, globby, jiggly bitches and being called sexy because we have a lot of junk in the trunk, and according to german people fat on a woman, even one ounce, is waaaay to fat...  Anyways, thank god we are in the US and after boozing all night we are allowed to visit such great establishements like Robertos. If you want to stay on the german skinny side, order the sides without any carbs. If you want the full american experience, get the full load :)  It is delicious, very inexpensive and more delicious as more you boozed."}
{"text":"One of the best Robertos I go to.  The chicken tacos are always good as well as the carne asada burritos. . Sada is super flavorful!  The red hot sauce is actually fire hot...so freeekin hot.... which is my favorite! Most importantly,  service is awesome,   the guy that works the window is very kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"We strolled in here around 1am looking to fill a void and we're pleasantly surprised to have to say this is one of the most competent of the Roberto's locations we've ever visited! I explained how I wanted all the toppings to my sans carne asada fries on the side along with extra crispy fries and they obliged! Very rare am I blessed to get exactly what I order at any Roberto's these days so this was worth yelping!   The restaurant was clean, the food was spot on, and salsa bar was really well maintained and filled with fresh veggies and salsa!  I can definitely drive the extra mile based on the quality of food and service here alone."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but the food was inexpensive and tasty and there was plenty to eat.. The salsa bar gave you options for your toppings and the food came out fast and hot. We were planning at stopping at one of the \"chain\" places in that area but glad we came here."}
{"text":"North Commerce location is NASTY & DIRTY. Went in and and quickly changed my mind about ordering."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find out Roberto's expanded YET AGAIN to this are of Henderson since my sister lives very close to this location. I'm pretty sure they just opened up a couple days ago.   In case you didn't know, Roberto's is my go-to post-debauchery food after a night of drinking and other shenanigans that happened, if I'm near one. Hell, I even think its amazing when sober. I usually go for their carne asada fries or a California burrito, but most of the time, like during my visit here, I went with the fries. It's a shade under 8 bucks, and so it seems slightly more expensive than the other locations I've been to. Either way I still think its worth it. Something about how they season the carne asada that keeps my fork busy. Pour on some of that chile verde sauce and its a done deal. Every bite is practically like going to heaven... twice. I wasn't even drunk or buzzed when I ate this mind you.   Since its a brand new location, I appreciate the cleanliness of it all. For a franchise with over 40 locations in the Las Vegas area alone, it sure knows what its doing when it comes to making amazing Mexican food.  If I ever crave it at say 5 in the morning, best believe I'd come here, since like pretty much all other locations, its 24 hours. That's right. 24 hours. Roberto's FTW."}
{"text":"Thank the Lord (and the people who run this place/franchise) that Roberto's exists. Especially after a drunken night at the Strip, nothing hits the spot like some greasy Mexican food that'll do work on your digestive system the next morning.   OK, so I originally had another location in my bookmarks, but my friends and I stumbled upon this location, and yes folks, this location is also 24 hours. The first night here, I ordered some carne asada fries while my buddies ordered California burritos. Came out to roughly 7 bucks, which is normal. they had chile verde salsa at the salsa bar so I took filled up a bunch of mini containers and took it to go.   From a drunken standpoint, hands down one of the best carne asada fries I've tasted, besides what I've had in San Diego. I thought Taqueria Chavez in Hayward was good, but holy crap this place took carne asada fries to another level. They use skinny fries, a fair balance of sour cream, guacamole, and shredded cheese. As far as the meat, the carne asada tasted like seasoned steak. I love steak, so that's pretty awesome of them to do it. OK, I know the last couple sentences sounded weird because carne asada is steak, but the flavor just comes out with each bite.   The next night, I ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and rice. Usually taquerias only include meat, guac, and onions in the burrito, which I think is kinda boring. The burrito came out to under 6 bucks, and it was pretty damn good too. Add the chile verde and its over. Oh, I tried the burrito after recovering from a buzz, so I was essentially sober when I ate it.   If you have a car and you're craving good food after a drunken evening, hit up any of the many locations Roberto's has. So worth it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and am still amazed how popular these places are. It must be because they're open 24 hours and late at night it's one of the few places you can get something to eat fast. That's the only reason I eat here.  The good is soso. It fills you up but as far as being flavorful it leaves a lot to be desired.  I'm sure I'll visit again. It serves a purpose."}
{"text":"Had the chance to stop off at this place during a long road trip on our way to Hoover Dam. I order their steak torta and my husband ordered one of their burritos.   I did not get a chance to try the burrito, but I was more than pleased with the torta. It was large, flavorful and stuffed with meat. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"The beef tacos were made with cooked Boiled beef.  Definitely not good tacos. The al pastor tacos were good, which is why I gave them more than 1 star. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is always on top of their game. I regularly place an order over the phone when I'm walking out the door of my house. The guy on the phone promises \"5 minutes\", and he ain't lying! When I arrive, my food is bagged up, ready to go. There is no decline in quality due to being quickly prepared either. I would highly recommend my usual bacon breakfast burrito, no potatoes, add carne asada. Delicious! Another staple order for us are the taquitos. The other day we ordered 12. When I arrived, they had only made me the order of 5. The guy working as cashier noticed the mistake before I did and corrected the error by giving me 12 MORE FREE OF CHARGE!! If that isn't customer service, I don't know what is. Will continue to order food from this location."}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving Mexican food.  I recognized the Robertos name from San Diego.  We got carne asada burritos to go.  They were really good with lots of tasty well seasoned meat inside.   The sauces from the salsa bar were all very good and the carrots were crispy abs hot.     If you crave California style Mexican food then Robertos will definitely satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"It's our first time visiting any Roberto's ever and we definitely went into the wrong location!! Worst customer service ever!!! No hi or hello and the lady looked mad as she takes the order and speaking to her fellow co workers in their own foreign language, who knows she could've been talking stink about me and my family having to have her take our orders.  Spent $50 on their food but we couldn't even stay to eat it there so we packed it to go. Will never go back to this location everrrrr!"}
{"text":"The help is very nice. Their food is great, chicken tacos are amazing and they are only $1.00 on taco Wednesday."}
{"text":"Looking for fast and DELICIOUS mexican food? Go to Roberto's and find happiness. Order the carne asada nachos and find bliss (as well as an extra pound or two). The service was suprisingly good. The cashier was super friendly (unlike some of the other Roberto's I went to). She was also very accomadating to the guests. -she replaced someone's ordered happily and even gave them the mistake order. (some places don't even do that!) -a few customers didn't know what to get and she helped them out  Man, I wish I got her name down.   The location is a bit older than the other gazillion roberto's that are around but the bathrooms were clean.  Now that I've mentioned the bathrooms, I can talk about the food...  The food was delicious. I ordered the carne asada nachos and I truly was about to cry in delight. The last time I got it (at a different location) it was very oily at the bottom. This time, it was not. There was so much meat on there I thought I was going to pop.  Did I mention that it was 24 hours??"}
{"text":"They have the best tacos and tamales!! So much better than Roberto's. And there also less expensive!! They have a  continent bar and dine in tables!! I just wish the horchata was better!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the incredibly rude service kills it.  Lady who works the counter on night shift is uninviting, rude and unprofessional.  We're all locals and won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"perfect spot to grab a bite to eat when you are done outlet shopping or about to return your rental car.  it was clean and yummy.  service was great.  i had the chicken chimichanga combo, perfect amount of sauces."}
{"text":"At 2:45 AM I wasn't sure what to expect for quality in this Mexican Food restaurant and a chain none the less. But, I was surprised!! I ordered the #13, beef chimichanga, rice, and re fried beans!! It was so outstanding! Quick service, fresh vegetable bar, awesome salsa!! Overall, very impressed, I see why after 50 years this chain is still going strong."}
{"text":"Truth be told, the five stars is probably due to a bit of nostalgia kicking in, but I was one happy customer!  We don't have Roberto's in NorCal, which is a real shame.  I thought they were only in Southern California, and therefore was very happy to discover this one in Las Vegas, just a couple of blocks from our hotel.  When I was in college in San Diego, I used to hit up Robertos restaurants (and the other copycat taco shops, like Roybertos, Albertos, Alibertos, etc.) on a regular basis.  Cheap, greasy, delicious food was available at nearly all hours of the day.  On this visit, we picked up a couple of orders of rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, a quesadilla, and a couple of carne asada tacos.  The restaurant was incredibly clean, and the staffers were friendly, even at 10 pm on a Saturday night.  The food was just as good as I'd remembered.  I hope I run into another Robertos on my travels again soon!"}
{"text":"Coming through from California & found this place on Yelp. DELICIOUS food! Some of the best carnitas I've ever had! Generous portions and beautiful food! Salsas are amazing as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Update:   No consistency   Chicken taco tastes like stewed chicken (watery)  $1 charge to use credit/debit card.  (Rip off)  The newness of the place is gone !!    Once I paid $5 for two cheese enchiladas.... the cheese wasn't even melted.    Not going back ..... lost my business !!!         Update:   They cleaned it up last visit.  5 Stars   -----------  4 Stars  Should be 5 stars ....CUZ the Tacos are the Best !!  But 4 stars because the dining room is dirty ....floors, table tops, salsa bar, trash bin area....FILTHY !!  Great food .... but dirty. Bring something from the car to put on the table or a CAN OF DISINFECTANT  !!   WHERE's a Manager ????"}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito, beef was waaaay rare. Not cool Robertos. You charge too much for this now."}
{"text":"They don't speak English at all. I asked for a breakfast taco and she said \"taco\" \"what taco\" , tried 5 times but nothing!! Had to leave and go somewhere else. Strangest thing ever!! :-)))"}
{"text":"The food is good but there's one employee, this lady has no customer service skills, she's rude and always has an attitude, I went with a few friends and she messed up on everyone's orders and when we told her instead of apologizing she said it wasn't her fault that we were drunk, and she didn't wanna serve us anymore, I call the owner to complain and they never call me back... I go to a different location now..."}
{"text":"ASK & YOU SHALL RECIEVE!!  Another Roberto's that meets my standards when I ask for what I want!! After having a hard morning & my annoying body had to satisfy my empty stomach after some exercises at PT. My stomach wanted some stinky queso!  As we walked in... all the chairs were on top of the tables & we thought the place was closing or something but they were only keeping the place spotless which I LOVE. The lady invited us in when we were hesitant & said \"don't worry its ok\" as we really didn't want to step on her hard worked mopped floors. Our cashier took our order he just had one facial expression but i assume he means we'll as his ACTION showed it much better. He HOOKED IT UP!  5 ROLLED TACOS - my goto as I like it unhealthy & order it w/ no lettuce & extra cheddar & ENCHELADO that stinky one! The Bleu cheese of mexican cheese. They make their rolled tacos like the meat squished in more so it's juicer & there's that extra tortilla all crispy like chips at the ends! =]  also comes with a fountain drink for $6.50   The mama was what made our day as we were dead tired she made us laugh... also my man was in a better mood when he saw the officer's facial expression (sitting across from me on another table) had a smirk when he caught me lickin my plate clean as my eyes came above the plate & made contact w/ his O_O *BLUSH* x2 forgot I wasn't at home."}
{"text":"Who can really complain about mexican food. Always come here whenever I want a quick bite in the random hours of the night.  The 5 rolled tacos with extra cheese  The Carne asada fries after a nice workout The California burrito to hit the spot And the breakfast burrito to eat half and save for when I wake up. Finally refreshing Jamaica to wash it all down  That's my story when it comes to robertos. The cashiers are always funny and cooks always hook it up when I ask for that extra queso! Like whopping handful of it!"}
{"text":"This has always been our go to for Mexican food when we travel to Las Vegas. The staff is helpful and friendly. The food is always great. The place looks like it hasn't been renovated in awhile but they do keep it decently clean but hey, who care though, as long the food is awesome. The best part, Roberto's is open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for late night gut busting drunk food, this is it!!  Greasy, delicious and cheap.  Recommend the Chimichanga.  The other locations are pretty good but this one in particular is the best!"}
{"text":"It's robertos you can't go wrong here. Best fast food Mexican game in town. The California burrito is probably my favorite but all their burritos are good. Their enchiladas and tacos are good but the burrito menu is where it's at"}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me what people get used to.  Over the years I have clung to people, places and things without even thinking much about it.  When I was a child I had my favorite used needle.  My homeless friend, Sir Albert Bottomtop used to sit with me for hours on a park bench telling me fantastic stories. He told me about the time he stabbed Peter O'toole in the leg after a drinking binge.  How he once walked in on Helen Mirren, a donkey and 20 ping pong balls.  How once he tackled Winston Churchill to the ground and pink bellied him until finally Chamberlin pulled him off and they all laughed. I cried when he told me about mentioning in passing how hot Wallis Simpson was.  Great stories.    One day I rode my tricycle to our bench and saw him...he was a beautiful shade of blue. He was clutching a needle. I took it.  I had that needle until I was arrested in Finland for kicking Paavo Lipponen in between the legs and screaming \"this is for cooperating with the Stasi.\" I smiled before those rotten fish eaters tackled me and my beloved needle fell smashing against the ground. My tears flooded the modern, sleek and tiny toilet in my cell. IKEA sucks.  After that was a blur of soda pop bottle tops, used underwear, a bra from Estelle Getty, the first place trophy from the Uganda \"Rock, Sissors, Paper\" championship, and a stuffed gerbil from an actor I can't legally name.  Suddenly today...I realized that I am still holding on to things that bring me comfort.  I realized after I woke up in an abandoned floral nursery and all I could smell was rotting tulips, goat feces (don't ask), and the smell of carne asada...and I felt the word roll off my lips...Roberto's.   Roberto's...I have mixed feelings about Roberto's...I have had some great meals and some horrible dishes depending on the location...so I am making this review LOCATION SPECIFIC!  If a duck just fell out of your ceiling with 100 dollar bill...LOCATION SPECIFIC...were the secret words of the day. Congratulations.  I want to start with the best thing on the menu...the Carne Asada Chimmichanga.  The Chimmichanga is always good...but one tip...ask for it to be extra crispy.  The shell goes from Conan O'Brien with a slight tan color to Cindy Crawford on a bikini photo shoot color...golden brown but not over done.  Second, never get the steak. I will always say this...Roberto's steak sucks. Get the chicken...or...the best one...the carne asada.  Pork. Crispy shell. Did I say pork? Well, read it again...even the word is perfect...think about how you can use it in a sentence. \"I ate great pork this weekend.\" OR \"I gave Emma Stone the pork this weekend.\" Both are beautiful. Both make me want to watch the video of that action with my pants down.   Tacos...are great. The Burritos are good if you observe the meat rule, and the shrimp is surprisingly good. The refried beans are good, and the rice sucks. The super nachos (carne asada) are a hangover godsend. The chule relleno are hit and miss. The taco rolls WITH guacamole are amazing. The red sauce is good, but not the best.  Roberto's is like having sex with a 400lb chick with no teeth...sometimes you get lucky and it is great. Sometimes 30 seconds in you wish you were anywhere else.  Drunk is ALWAYS better.  You dream of Rex. Rex dreams of someone else. You dream of Rex more."}
{"text":"Just plain good!! I remember when it was two of these in the city. Now they're everywhere for a reason. Just a very well done Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"Just got two carne asada fries and the fries taste like they've been sitting in old grease for days. So disgusting!"}
{"text":"Menu looked good but the breakfast burritos were horrible.  Destroyed my day, should have went to Fausto's!  Never again and my boss agreed."}
{"text":"The service was abhorrent. As I experienced the cashier giving me snarky remarks and had a rude tone, it felt belittling since all I did was ask the difference between the fillings of different tacos.  The food was refund worthy. Meat was plain, taco bar looked like it was in shambles and the place wreaked of bleach with a mixture of dirty wet towels. Would never step foot in this place ever again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's location :) the  service is awesome . I always ask for my green onions to be grilled and they do it without hesitation . Their salsa bar is always clean and there tacos are delicious!  I love coming for the Wednesday chicken taco special. California burrito is bomb too!    The atmosphere isn't too welcoming but whatevs I come for the food"}
{"text":"Was SO Excited to see Roberto's here in Henderson as I grew up eating there in So. California. Sadly there is something lost in translation crossing the California/Nevada border. The food is pretty bland, no real heat from the hot sauces and just lacking flavor all around. Sooo bummed. Wish the recipes were the same as they are supposedly the same owners as the ones in So. California but just not the same."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and was having a craving, or two, or three, for a California Carne Asada Burrito.   The California Carne Asada Burrito was solid. I mean, I've had better and I've most certainly had worse. These were better than most. I liked them.   The location is odd. It is attached to a gas station/convenience store/car wash - that's just odd. Not necessarily bad, just odd.   I'd go back."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. Went in tonight and ordered 2 meals. After waiting 25 minutes and the three numbers behind us being called, we asked the cashier about our food. He told us it was coming twice. Then after he called the next number my husband told him to look for it. It wasn't coming because they lost our ticket. Now at the 30 minute mark we told the cashier we either wanted a discount or our money back and we would eat elsewhere. They refused both and by that time our food was ready so he said he wouldn't give us our money back because our food was ready now. We asked for his name and the mangers name. The employee refused to give us his name and said he didn't have a manager at all. After arguing with him for several minutes asking for the manager or owners name he finally have us a generic 800 number but then refused to give us our customer copy receipt back that he had taken when they lost our order.  Poorest customer service ever and the food was mediocre. I promise they will not get our business again"}
{"text":"I didn't expect gourmet food. But I REALLY like Mexican food and Roberto's is conveniently located inside Sam's Town. My order was taken by a worker who obviously didn't want to be there. After an unsmiling, terse exchange she yelled the plate number to the cook. The food came quickly. It looked and tasted like an old style TV dinner. I'm sure the ingredients were from cans, not fresh. The burrito was almost all tortilla, chewy and triple wrapped around a few pieces of stringy meat, sliced/preserved peppers and something pale pink that might once have been tomato. The enchilada was the same but smaller. After a few bites I emptied the tray where it belonged. Live and learn..."}
{"text":"It's good, most of the time. You might find cripsy taquito's (rolled tacos, heh heh) or you mind find bendible taquitos, reheated and chewy. Let's be honest, most Las Vegans wouldn't know good Mexican food anyway, so Roberto's has nothing to worry about and I expect their brand of nothing-special to be around for years to come.  The best part about this restaurant is the salsa bar but be warned; The dirt-biker types that frequent this taqueria can be found LICKING THEIR FINGERS as they load up on extra-mild salsa and limes.  3 star median for 4 star freshness alternating with 2 star reheat."}
{"text":"This is the worst Roberto's restaurant that I've ever been to. If I could give it a negative star, I would!  It took them 20 minutes to make 2 breakfast burritos for me. The restaurant was not busy at all. The cook lost my order. I called the manager. His response was.... \"Don't come back\". Really?!  Oh, I definitely won't be back. Very ignorant and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Solid every time I stop in, my guilty pleasure cheap Mexican joint. Love the rolled tacos with guac. Cheese quesadilla is a fave. Carne Asada breakfast burrito is a must try in my book."}
{"text":"Consistently bad food.., workers are really pleasant though,...pls.discontinue the fake cheap cheese, hard taco shells are like greasy bricks. Unedible, employees Are polite though....."}
{"text":"I only go to Robertos when I'm craving Taquitos. Or as Robertos calls it rolled tacos. Today was the first time I visited this location. My rolled tacos were super skinny with very little chicken. I usually go to the one on Charleston and Decatur. They dont skimp the chicken so I was surprised at how skinny these ones were."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 1 star for service. Went in 05/10 through the drive thru waited for 10 minutes and no one was to be found place is open 24hrs open, I knocked and honked and still no one. Three cars were behind me so I chose to go in. Oh all if the sudden I see a young woman come from the back. Had one customer just show up when I went in. I asked in a nice tone hey I've sitting outside for ten minutes with ppl behind me waiting I honked n knocked. She's like I'm only one cashier (Esther) and can't be in two places at one time. Yeah cuz she was in the back doing who knows who or what. Mind you there were two men in the back as well. Not professional at all."}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada fries and got no carne. They wont even replace it. All the cashier said was \"my bad\"."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT!but their is a little issue. I noticed that the GREEN and RED Salsa didn't work anymore. We thought they would at least change it. The lady did not to anything. You could see it bubbling and it taste like acid. And she had the guts to say \"oh así está bien\" translación oh its fine like that  hm yeah okay  REALLY?"}
{"text":"Always friendly fast service, and the place is usually very clean.  No matter what time of day, the food seems fresh and they are great about the quantity of carne asada for example, so you always feel like you got a good value for the money.  Wish they had a drive through, but it's worth walking inside compared to Don TortacNO just down the street.  Go Roberto's!"}
{"text":"The best Roberto's location I've been to so far. Had the lengua burrito for the first time and didn't think I'd like it, but it's pretty bomb. I usually order the carne asada or adobada fries, but I'm gonna start ordering that burrito too."}
{"text":"This is the worst Robertos I have ever been to! I ordered chicken nachos yesterday and today my girlfriend and I both have food poisoning from them. 12 hours and we still havent stopped throwing up from both ends...hate to be crude but this place is shitty!!! Dont waste your time or money.  The parent company ought to shut this location down and fire all the workers in this location!"}
{"text":"I've tried the chicken enchiladas combo twice and the shredded chicken Tacos combo. Food is great, customer service is nice & the wait isn't long!"}
{"text":"Roberto's has lost me forever! A Mexican restaurant with \"No Jalapeños\"! Might as well go to Toco Bell."}
{"text":"My gf introduced me to Roberto's, and if she hadn't, there's an excellent chance I would've missed Roberto's altogether.  It's un-remarkably decorated to the point of almost drab inside and out, at least the location I patronize, but clearly Roberto knows he doesn't need to spend money on the ambiance since people flock there to eat.  I don't really know authentic Mexican food, and I tend to go for the ala cart items like a simple regular taco, but I can judge a good place by the line at the counter that's there no matter what time of day (and Roberto's is open 24/7).  Because of hours of business, the place can sometimes draw an odd crowd.  If I were hungover, second only to Waffle House, I'd go for Roberto's at 3AM, but that's another story for another kind of forum.    My gf gets the #11 every time.  I don't know what all is in that, but she never deviates from that item.  She piles on the carrots from the condiment bar, too.  She loves Roberto's and that's really why I continue to spend money at this place because the food in terms of flavor, doesn't really stand out to me, but I can tell a real difference in Roberto's dishes compared to other fast food Mexican joints.  It's fresh, for starters.  And for fresh, they prepare it made-to-order every time and quickly.  If the crowd at Roberto's is unruly, at least I don't have to hang around there too long."}
{"text":"Garbage service from the ghetto lady who can hardly speak and understand English. She was extremely rude and dismissive. Plus look at the very unsanitary way they gave me limes when I asked for them. I will be reporting this place to the health department!"}
{"text":"The bathroom here is absolutely disgusting. One of the dirtiest bathrooms I have ever seen and to top it all off no soap. Glad the cooks have no soap to use before they make your food."}
{"text":"Dirty!! Smelly!!  Walked in and the first thing that hit me was the smell..omg!!! Cigarette and toilet piss.. no joke i felt like I walked into a freaking smokers house . All the tables were filthy dirty. wth!! Dissatisfaction to the fullest.. I just hope the owner wakes the fuck up and turns this place around... food was good tho.    Ps: no fumen en el restaurante pendejos.!!!"}
{"text":"All of the food is usually very good and inexpensive. However, the thing that bothers me the most about all Roberto's shops is that when you add beans to something they want to charge you $0.90 to me that's just bad customer service and ripping people off because the burrito is the same size so when you add beans they're going to take away carne asada or they're going to take away eggs and bacon if it's a breakfast burrito because burritos have to be a certain size otherwise you can't wrap them up so you don't get a credit back for the bacon and egg or the carne asada that they minus from your burrito so why do they charge you.  When I complained they gave me a really small burrito with lots of tortilla I guess that's their way of saying up yours"}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. I was so disappointed. Their food taste like crap. I couldn't even finish my meal. I got the chicken plate with enchillada. It just taste bad. The most portion I ate was probably the bean. I don't even eat the bean most time. I eat the rice, but their rice is just bad too. I don't see what the big deal is."}
{"text":"Why people like this place is a complete mystery to me.  Not only the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted, but the worst food of any type ever.  Greasy, bland, overly \"wet\" and borderline unfit for human consumption."}
{"text":"I remember when Roberto's was still somewhat of a novelty when I was growing up here in Vegas. Now, I feel like there is a Roberto's around every damn corner. They just keep poppin up like babies in a Mormon family (No offense to Mormons or the Mormon religion). Can't complain I guess :/  Not much has changed. Some are still open 24 hrs if you wanna get your late night taco fix on.  Their shredded beef hard tacos are still dank asf, dripping with grease after every crunchy bite. I recently ordered their chips and guac here (this was actually my first time ordering chips and guac from Roberto's), and it was some green guac sauce, not actual guacamole. That was disappointing. Besides that, I still love my oily hard shell beef tacos drizzled with their green and red salsa."}
{"text":"They were open on Christmas! The tacos appeared to be made in house and the bread on the torta was tasty, yum!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss carne asada fries!  This is one thing I miss about living in Cali & Vegas!  Of course I had to introduce my girlfriends to this West Coast yummy jewel while we were in LV for a bachelorette party! ;D  And they fell in love with it too! =)  Viva la Carne Asada fries!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. We have been there on 3 separate occasions (figured third time would be the charm?) and have been wholly disappointed! Tacquitos were so hard and dry and bland, not even my dog was interested. Fish tacos had bones in them twice. I literally wouldn't even eat this poor excuse for food if it was given for free. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Where did they go wrong? Their quality has always been between a 3-5.  The 5 star experience make up for the \"A-OK\" experience.  Today was just a disaster and I'm very off put about coming back here for a while.  Here are a few suggestions that I hope they follow as I've been eating at this place for over a year now:  1. Learn to begin calling orders by number and not by what people ordered. It will help with the inevitable confusion that ensues when people order the same thing!  2. It may make sense for you to have more than one register to take orders!  3. When I give you my card to pay, please, please, PLEASE stop walking away with it.  Fraud is abundant and you force me to have to watch your every move to make sure you don't swipe my card again.  4. When I order \"FOR HERE\" DO NOT put it in to go because it's easier for you...  Believe it or not, when you order \"FOR HERE\" you get better quality tacos and a larger portion.  5. Be consistent in your assembly of tacos!  Usually we get lots of cheese and chicken in our chicken tacos.  Now we get mostly lettuce, a PINCH of cheese and a few slivers of chicken! WHY? WHY? WHY?  6. WASH YOUR HANDS if you handle money and then my food.  7. Put priority on handing the food to your customers, rather than taking in the orders (see #2 about getting another register). Nothing chaps my a$$ more than waiting another 10 mins because you let me stare at my tacos and let them get cold as you take peoples orders. PRIORITIZE!  Summary: What happened to the A-Team here. I came here today (1/8/2014) and it was like the C-Team was working the place.  Usually the cooks are fast and efficient, it looked like they were half asleep this time.  The cashier was very inefficient and slow and did not put the food out when it was ready.  I was just watching my food get cold and the food pile up behind him.  Then the food came with hardly any chicken or cheese.  Seriously? These are chicken tacos!  Either the entire team needs more training or some energy drinks.  What happened to my A-Team?!?  I've been horribly disappointed with my most recent experience so I think I will have to put this Roberto's location on timeout for a while.  There are better places now than this place - like Baja Taco right down the street."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend (LV native) and I first cooked up the idea to spend my 30th birthday in Vegas, a stop at Roberto's was the first thing he mentioned we HAD to do.   I mean--he was so serious, you guys. Feasting on their chicken tacos was a must--as many times as possible while we were there. Boy am I glad my boyfriend has great taste, because Roberto's changed my life. And from his expression as we gobbled down this authentic, Mexican goodness, I could tell they tasted just the same as he remembered.   First, it's cheap and it's fast--but the portions and the quality of the food will knock your face off.   Second, get yourself some chicken tacos. As many other Yelpers mentioned, their all-white-meat chicken is shredded perfection. It isn't seasoned to all hell, just ever so slightly, so you can still taste the chicken. And yea, it's greasy--but it's because they deep fry those suckers fresh in front of you. Ermahgerd. And if you really want to taste it as it should be, just get shredded cheese and lettuce on 'em. That's it. Then top it with some of their delicious, homemade hot sauces. It's everything that's right in the world. And if one form of shredded chicken and cheese, deep-fried in a fresh tortilla isn't enough, then please let me recommend their taquitos!  We get them with just cheese melted on top with a scoop of their homemade guacamole. Perfection in crunchy, gooey, food form.   Roberto's tacos are a Vegas must-try. Just ask the folks who live there or grew up there--they'll point you in the right direction. And I trust me some locals (and Yelpers!)"}
{"text":"Best Roberto's in town.We have used this location many times after my daughters gymnastic classes we have just across the street from them.Don't get me wrong .its still a Taco Shop but they are very consistent and atleast you know what you will get for your money."}
{"text":"Lots of food for the money! They are fast and food good...our favorite it the beef chimi and asada fries! Both are huge! Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"open 24/7 dine in and drive thru. bunch of locations everywhere and always great food for those drunken nights lol. it may not be the best mexican food but for the convenience and affordable prices. it'll satisfy your cravings for mexican food anytime of day."}
{"text":"I had been to a few of these places since I moved out here four years ago, and I must say I have been disappointed with most of them.  However, that all changed with this location.  First of all, it is immaculate.  Whenever I go in there, they are always cleaning when they are not busy.  The kitchen, food prep area, and dining room are all in tip-top shape.  And the service is top notch as well.  They are all very friendly, and very fast with the food preparation.  And the food is always hot, fresh and good.  There are quite a few Roberto's locations around town that could learn a lot from the employees/management of this location."}
{"text":"This place is always slow messes up orders rude the food is not consistent sometimes it's good other times it's bland and tough.  I am going to start just driving the extra mile to A different toco shop"}
{"text":"Disappointed that they made a mistake and gave me a hard time. The screwed up part is they called ME a liar. Thank you Robertos on Bermuda And Pyle."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's location. The food is amazing. I cannot a week without eating here. Everything is so delicious."}
{"text":"This is the worst robertos ever!!!! If you want to get ripped off go here. The burritos are smaller than taco bells and cost twice as much and the reason given by the employee is they weigh the food but thats not even possible since there was no scale used to weigh my food or anyehere in sight. You could literally put your fingers around the carne asada burrito and pich them together. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is about the best hispanic food in the valley. Everything else is too Americanized or too expensive. An absolute must when you're craving something south of the border"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Way better than Alberto's ... I had the beef shredded hard shell tacos... They were great & had real shredded beef ( unlike a Taco Bell)... Must try when in Vegas... At least for a quick snack before heading to the strip"}
{"text":"It's a small hole in the wall type place that's attached to a gas station and car wash. But it's exactly what I was looking for as I was looking for. It's quick, cheap and tasty. You know that any time they have pictures on the menu board, it's likely to be good!"}
{"text":"This Robertos is constantly inconsistent, sometimes your meal is spot on and others it's not how you ordered it, at al. The food sizes/ quality are never the same.  They have a drive thru but it always takes forever to get your food. They really could step it up and reap the benefits.   We find ourselves driving to another location because they are faster and consistent."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 2 is cuz I was drunk and it was good but my l ft overs sucked! And yes my shrimp main meal was refrigerated shrimp. So maybe get tacos or a burrito? N e way not coming here again."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty tacos! Ingredients seem pretty fresh, and it's really really cheap. We're talking 6 or 7 bucks for tacos, beans, and rice, or whatever other combo plate you choose. They're also open 24 hours, and conveniently located next to a bar. The only downside to the place is it's ambiance. It's not a nice looking feeling place. It's a run down counter service shop with a few tables and chairs. It's a little on the trashy looking side, but the food's good, the service is friendly, and it's mostly a takeout kind of place anyways."}
{"text":"I've been to the shop on the NW side of town so while grocery shopping here and seeing this place I was excited. They are 24 hours so you can't beat that. I ate here before grocery shopping at smiths so I didn't shop hungry, because let's face it we all do it from time to time and regret it later.  Service was fast and friendly. The eating area was clean and tidy. The topping bar was clean and pleasant to eat from. My food came out in like 5 minutes. My partner got a very flavorful carnitas burrito, I liked it. I got 3 rolled chicken taquito tacos with cheese and sour cream on it. For $3.50 it was a solid serving and price.   I enjoy it all the time so if you love tacos check them out. None of the meals were greasy. Most places like this you get a lot of that. I felt good later too we all know sometimes our stomach can hurt.  I will defiantly will be back next time I'm at smiths shopping. From staff to food to cleanliness I give this place a 4/5 stars!!"}
{"text":"After a meh experience at Fausto's, I decided to give Roberto's a chance.   The burrito itself was definitely larger than Fausto's and the carne asada tasted much better. The salsa bar here was also missing pico de gallo... I guess they dont serve pico in NV taco shops?  I am also happy that this location is down the street from my school. I am pretty sure my wallet and waist line will hate me for finding this place."}
{"text":"Gotta love when the whole restaurant smells like the bathroom. I've been to some hole in the wall places that haven't smelled as bad as this place. I've been to plenty of Robertos in the past. This one wasn't very good.  It's hard to mess up carne asada nachos. I know it's an Americanized dish but at least melt the cheese on the nachos. There was a lot of meat on them but the whole thing seemed really salty."}
{"text":"Bad cucumbers like most Roberto's. But usually the asada fries are good at all the locations I've tried.  I paid $10 for a small portion of Arne asada fries that was presented like soup, drowned in runny guacamole and sour cream. There were barely any fries. And I kept having to spit out weird pieces of meat. Also topped with way too much fake cheese."}
{"text":"Service was adequate, tacos are a little pricey at $2.75 a pop. I wouldn't complain about the price but the tacos (carnitas and carne asada) were bland and the red salsa included was absolutely tasteless. Only tried the tacos, can't comment on anything else. Disappointed first time visitor."}
{"text":"Place is clean and staff is friendly.  Food is very good.  Dined in but was very uncomfortable because it was to hot, they have a/c, but it not set right.  Sweating half way thru meal.  Guess drive thru is the only way."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's! I haven't had a bad experience at any location. The carne asada tacos are some of the best in town. LOTS of steak inside.   PROS: Carne Asada taco             Open 24 hours             Free refills"}
{"text":"There is a need for a place like Roberto's in just about every city. Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.  I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.  Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.  Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.  While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick. For those of you who are back and forth with the meat selection, just know that machaca (shredded beef) is the way to go.  Open 24 hours. Gracias to all who made this happen."}
{"text":"The chicken burritos are extremely dry and it also advertises that you get tomatoes in them. You actually don't and they make a big fuss about them damn tomatoes. The cook can't cook by any means."}
{"text":"I only ever seem to yelp when I have a complaint. But not this time! I always have great service here. They are always generous with portions. And I never seem to get enough green sauce unless I go in and get it myself. But when I ask this location for it, i find like, 5 containers of it in my bag. They are just great. And always so pleasant. ALWAYS."}
{"text":"1st, any place that has horchata is my kind of restaurant. I got the largest chimichanga ever! My son in law was happy to have the left overs. I got the beef and it was filed with chunks of steak. Yummy. I enjoyed the pickled carrots from their salsa bar. Service was fast for how much food we ordered for take out. The staff gave us suggestions for on what to order for our 2 year olds. Definitely going back on my next visit to LV. There are so many locations too. Fortunately one is down the block from my daughters house, yummy"}
{"text":"burrito here is the worst i have had...  small and a little pricey. coming from california, im use to real impressive burrito =("}
{"text":"I eat at many of the Roberto's Tacos in the area and this is by far the worst one. The oil they use to fry in tastes old and rancid. The tacos are very skimpy and tasteless. The other Roberto's are very good, especially the chicken taco wednesday's. They need help with this one. Maybe the owners should check out this location because it really does suck!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been my go-to for years after a heavy night of using and drinking heavily. Clean, nice employees, but often a bunch of loud people in the store, so I prefer to access it through the window in the gas station. Also, sometimes there is a woman who sits in the back and just stares. I don't appreciate it and I know you wont either. They don't allow smoking inside which sucks because it's next to a bar and im a chain smoker"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very nice and calm. The restaurant has Mexican music playing which adds a very nice touch to the culture of the place. The food was very good and the price for it makes it even better!! The restaurant gets a lot of clientele coming in but you still receive your order in a timely manner.  The reason for my three star review is due to the cleanliness of the restaurants bathroom. They aren't clean and not sure if they keep up with it on a regular basis or hourly basis for the customers."}
{"text":"This place is sloppy. Food is always half wrapped or cheese is not even on the actual tacos. Just half ass work. Water down drinks too."}
{"text":"Much better than the other Roberto's around. Always a line but never a bad wait. Good customer service. And open 24 hours."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for this location. I've tried other Roberto's in the Valley but always like coming back to this one on Durango and DI. What more could you ask for as it's cheap, filling and tastes great. I always get the Carne Asada nachos minus the beans (I don't care for the beans). Mucho pico de gallo as well. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Roberto's in the valley. I used to go to the one on DI and Durango but they charge you extra for using a debit card. I found this one on Trop and Ft. Apache and it is just as good, if not better. The interior is really nice, large and well lit. Plenty of places to sit down. The salsa bar is also better stocked and cleaner. I always get the Carne Asada Nachos with extra pico de gallo but that was just too much food for me today. Instead I settled for the Shrimp burrito. This burrito was on point. Just a tad too much rice but onions, green peppers and large shrimp were really good. Make sure you get the spicy version for a good kick."}
{"text":"Used to get this all the time when we lived in San Diego. We moved to Seattle for a few years and were happy to see this was here. Just as good as we remember if not better!"}
{"text":"Drove through the drive thru and because the person taking my order didn't speak English that well, half my food was missing. This was the explanation I was give for half my food being missing. This is unacceptable especially since they have significantly raise their prices but still can't get their orders right"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this Roberto's yet? This location isn't the closest to our house, but it's our favorite for one reason: it is freaking clean! I mentioned when it first opened how clean it was and my BIL assured me it would be just as greasy and grimy as every other Roberto's in no time. Not so, sir! They've been open for a while and are just as clean as when they opened.  On our most recent visit, I got a ham breakfast burrito and my husband did a steak breakfast burrito add bacon. The green salsa was friggen' spicy that day! I love that they're connected to the AMPM so you have more drink choices than the fountain-I was able to swing over there and grab a coffee, which was really nice. We love this location and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For the money that you are paying, Roberto's Taco Shop offers a sufficient quantity and has a very consistent quality from my past experiences. Although Roberto's is good when sober, but it is most definitely better tipsy.  Although the staff there can be a little bit grumpy working an overnight shift, it is a minor issue because Roberto's is virtually fast-food and does not require too much service."}
{"text":"I ordered on the phone before I drove here to pick up the food. The guy that tommy order was kind of a @&$% but, I'm stupid and I ordered anyway.   I didn't realize that it's in a gas station. My son is the Roberto's expert and he said he likes this one or the one down the street. I disregarded my initial instincts not to eat at a gas station.    First of all, the food had zero flavor. The enchiladas (which I have had at Roberto's plenty of times) were full of onions and green peppers. Literally! I didn't order a veggie plate.   Second, the food had no flavor.    Third, I became so sick after ingesting this garbage. I was weeping from the razor sharp pain in my intestines ... It was quite intense. I got sick and felt horrible the rest of the night.   That's what I get for eating at a gas station!!! Ugh!"}
{"text":"This place was our choice for dinner, it started off with walking through the door the place was clean and very professional.   We placed our order with the gentlemen at the front and he promptly submitted our order as we paid. The food was amazing and very good value, the value does match the quality. I would recommend and return to this establishment in the future!"}
{"text":"There is a real attitude problem at this Location with the two Men that were working tonight on Oct 2nd.   The cashier was extremely rude, and needs to be talked to. He has no customer service skills can barely understand English. I'm not saying he doesn't know but you work in a restaurant, you are going to have many different people coming in. And if Spanish is all you can speak being a cashier probably isn't the best position for him.   But I ordered two chimichangas and two carna fries and with one meat one the side.  They got my order wrong the first, and the second. My fries still came with all that meat. And the cashier walked to the back as they put my order up and didn't come back up. I will definitely being coming back to speak with a manager."}
{"text":"I tried to order 2 rice and bean burritos, no cheese . They wanted almost $10.00. Are you kidding me??????  RIP OFF... RIP OFF RIP OFF....."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's in Vegas. The service is good and the food is pretty darn good. Went with a hungry crew from work and all seemed to be satisfied. I got Carne Asada chips that were hot and tasty with a chicken taco for good measure. Great experience. Will definitely return. It gets busy at lunch so call your order in ahead of time and it will be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Much better this time around. Went a little later than usual, which made a huge difference. A later lunch meant no long line. The chorizo burrito was hot to the touch and remained that way 'til the very last morsel. The quesadilla was hot as well and cheesier than my boss's cheesy redneck jokes.   Avoid the traditional \"lunch hour\" here and you are good to go. It's amazing what a difference an hour can make. Between 11:00 and 12:30, you have to wait in a long line and can barely find a seat. The further you can stray from that time frame, the better your experience gets.   Next time I'm going to give the chicken tacos a whirl. A co-worker chowed down on some and they looked scrumptous."}
{"text":"\"Oh I have a great idea, let's have 99 cent taco Wednesdays, but let's charge our customers OVER A DOLLAR for extra cheese - ONLY ON WEDNESDAYS.\" ..... said no manager with good customer service EVER.  My order should not have cost more than maybe $6 and change, but turned out to be over $10 BECAUSE THEY CHARGED ME OVER A DOLLAR FOR EXTRA CHEESE ON EACH TACO. The CHEESE cost more than the WHITE MEAT chicken, lettuce, and tortilla used on the tacos. Absolute BULLSH*T. I don't recommend anyone bring this location their business on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"We come here almost every Sunday night after church.  The food is delicious.  so far I have had the carnitas and the carne asada here.  The meat is good quality, never fatty.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they charge $0.50 to pay with a credit card.  This is a turn off for a lot of people.  They should have just thought through the menu and charged 3% more per item to recover the credit card fees.  Then no one would know and all would be happier.  Great food and fantastic service."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go here so often we should own stock. They are always pretty fast even when busy and have no problem taking four or five orders at a time from someone. They don't like doing substitutions much but I can live with that. Food is always fresh and good plus you can watch them make it."}
{"text":"We got there a 2:00 am on a Saturday. The man at the register was very rude, no costumer service experience and lack of manners.   When Got there was telling off a costumer saying \" if you don't like the service get the hell out of here then\" the costumer replied \"are you the boss?\"   The man at the cashier said \"no, but almost\".   Anyhow, since I didn't know how their argument began, I went ahead and place my order. When it was time for me to get it, the main at the cashier grabbed my food with his bare hands after he had been handling money, touching his face, and scratching the back of his head. I told him that I did not want the order of food that he had touched with his bare hands. Then as I was looking at the rest of my order, he didn't separate the guacamole and cheese from my taquitos. When I told him that I did not receive the rest of my order the way I had requested it, he stated yelling at me in front of my wife and children. Finally I requested my money back which he did refunded it, however, not before throwing it to me at my face.   Save your selves the headache and don't bother going to this place."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego where the 1st Roberto's location started. This place is nothing like it. Not even close. I will just wait until I go back to San Diego this weekend to go there. Really hard to find taco shops here. I've had some of the best in San Diego so I know what it's not suppose to taste like. Sorry I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Good food but the never answer the phone to do take out order please resolve this!!! And I will make a better review."}
{"text":"I suppose if I looked up other locations you'd see I have given them good reviews too. I love this chain of semi independent authentic restaurants.  Family owned and operated yet part of a larger chain. Each location has its own vibe and decor, some better than others but the food is always hardy, filling and of great quality.  I ordered two burritos, Not that I could have eating two because they are huge. I saved the second one for breakfast as I knew I was not going to have a lot of time the next morning.   One was steak and the other was Machaca which is egg, shredded beef, and typical Mexican marinated option and peppers.   Most of the people coming in were the kind of mix that give it more character. A black family with three cute little kids, two guys in dress clothes and ties, a Hispanic family who seemed to be regulars, a couple of scary looking gangbangers who were actually polite and friendly, an older Spanish woman who seemed to not speak any english, and the Mexican staff working the counters and in back. I'm guessing mostly family and owners.  They were friendly and polite too.   Its not fancy, or chic, its not trendy, dressed up or touristy, its just great food with a hardy authentic feel."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Roberto's I've ever been to. The food is good and the staff is friendly. The restaurant has always been clean every time I've been here and it is why I continue to come."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, we waited 45 minutes for 2 burritos one bean and cheese the other chili Colorado. Also people that came in after us got their food before we did. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Every time I fly to Las Vegas I have to stop at Roberto's to get my Mexican food fix! I love the food here, it's what we are missing in Hawaii!   The staff here is always friendly, helpful and attentive as well! If you don't know what to order or what is in the food, just ask and they'll help you!   I always order the carne asada fries and the bacon breakfast burrito. Those 2 are my favorite things to eat! The carne asada is seasoned to perfection and the food is made fresh!   They also have all of these pickled vegetables and salsa for you to make for yourself, just remember to take what you need, so they can keep their costs down!   The restaurant is always kept clean which I love!   I miss this place when I go home, we really need one in Hawaii, I can't stand Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I've ordered other items before and have been disappointed... Carne asada fries by far are the best thing on the menu! The flavor combination is no joke... Do yourself a favor and get some! It's even big enough to share with friends and when you taste it your gonna want everyone to know about it."}
{"text":"I came here two days ago seeking a good breakfast burrito. I ended up getting the sausage burrito with added shrimp (they only give you 6) and no potatoes. My burrito was a pretty decent size. Still looked and felt as full as it appeared in the picture. I come this morning and request the same burrito but this time without shrimp; still did not request potatoes. They gave me the smallest burrito I have ever seen. Disappointed. They wanted to argue down the fact that it was virtually impossible for them to add at least one additional egg or sausage because they didn't charge me for it. If I am substituting potatoes, I should be able to have something else added without hesitation. Never coming here AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service everyone is super rude and I had to clean my own table when I was there mind you it wasn't busy had a whole bunch of workers standing around when I asked for napkins to clean his tables so I would never recommend this location"}
{"text":"I love this place but lately the service has gone downhill. My kids and I eat there at least once a week.  They really need to review who they have working the register the gal that helped me last night was extremely rude and if she's working next time I go there I will go somewhere else not happy at all!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! Im definitely NOT coming back after that lady's attitude! I ordered a horchata and she handed me the cup & i said I asked for horchata & she said ice? i said yeah & she told me \"go get it yourself!\" Customer service is everything at a restaurant! She was RUDE!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. The rolled tacos weren't even fried, looked like they were just defrosted from the freezer and placed in the microwave. You don't get to serve your own condiments so when i asked for hot sauce (which they already have prepacked) the container had a half of a teaspoon full! The food tasted horrible and they don't give out refunds, only exchanges. DO NOT COME HERE UNTIL THEY GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"This particular location is clean and the food is delicious! Good customer service and they serve generous portions."}
{"text":"First off I love robertos I always come here drunk, sober etc lol. But this location is disgusting and dirty! When I got home and looked at my chicken tacos that I always get on Wednesday I was not pleased. It tasted like straight chemicals, I barely took two bites. My cat which eats anything and everything and usually loves robertos chicken would not eat it!!!! That says a lot. I will never come back to this location I'll continue to go to the fort Apache one. At least at that location they aren't rude either!"}
{"text":"The food here is so very fresh and very fast. The cashier guy was really friendly even after dealing the girls in front of me who could not make up their mind. I love places that are open 24 hrs :)"}
{"text":"I love the stake and fries it is to die for. The rolled tacos  are from the heavens I get the 5 rolled tacos but if you just want to snack there is a three rolled taco meal ."}
{"text":"My husband continually bugs me to hit up a Mexican food place wherever we visit (yes, even in Japan) so when we visited Vegas for a weekend we had to go to Roberto's. My brother lives there and he always goes here for his fix. We ate Roberto's twice in one day. We picked up three breakfast burritos for $12 bucks. The bag the burritos were in felt like it weighed 10 pounds and for the price pretty worth it. We went there for lunch before we headed on an airplane for a 6 hour flight. I had two carnitas tacos and my husband had the chile relleno plate. The carnitas tacos had guacamole and pico de gallo on it and the green salsa they have tastes amazing. The carnitas meat seemed to be charred on the edges which made it crispy. It was really tasty. My husband loved his chile relleno plate and seemed to drink the red hot salsa they had as he poured it over everything. Anyway, even though Roberto's is a pretty big chain in Vegas, the food was pretty good and they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I went to college in San Diego and Whatever-Berto's were always a good choice.  This one in Vegas is really similar.  Portions are massive and price is cheap."}
{"text":"If you go with the basics, the food here is good enough. If you are seeking an above average dining experience you've stepped foot in the wrong place. I've finally figured out that you do not use the salsa bar unless you want a stummy ache. I don't know what could happen to a 24 hour salsa bar, but I bet it isn't a pretty sight. Did someone sneeze into it? did a child swirl the sauce with dirty hands? maybe dropped the handle part of the tongs into it?  I just want to say, I order the basic popular items and they are good enough for your basic Mexican food cravings. Bean and Cheese burritos with rice is good and so are the rolled tacos (taquitos), but use your own salsa or hot sauce from home cause I blame the salsa bar on tummy aches or ........"}
{"text":"The cook dropped a burrito on the floor ... picked it up... and put it back in the fryer.... didn't bat an eye when called on it. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"WOOOOOW!  I just spent 40 bucks on some great mexican food.   Love the carne asada fries, nacho's and carne asada taco. But NOT a fan of the rolled taco.   The lady in the drive thru was very polite and friendly.  I guess if I want to do a taco run I'll go back to this Roberto's with the friendly people."}
{"text":"The horchata is bomb and the tortas have lots of guacamole, but its really frustrating that the frijoles have lard. There are many things on the menu I just can't eat, but the chicken wings at certain locations are good and cheap!"}
{"text":"A lot better than I expected. Everyone told me to check it out, but my boys don't like Mexican, so I had to stop by on my way back from work. It was pretty good. I had a couple of tacos and a burrito. It tasted fresh...much better than other fast food Mexican places. But it was almost as cheap as they are. I'll go back again and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Place smells awful all the time. Worst customer service ever. No eye contact you don't get greeted they act like your bothering them. Very stingy with the hot sauce napkins whatever. Practically toss you the food when I do the drive thru. I'm heading back to forte apache and flamingo. It's further for me but done dealing with these people!"}
{"text":"Located inside Sam's Town Casino, Roberto's is a delicious spot for quick Mexican food. The steak nachos were pretty darn good. They come in a large serving good for sharing. This location was clean and the serves was good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The customer service here is as bad as it gets....I called in an order ahead of time and when I got there(roughly 25 mins later)they hadn't even started my order...this isn't the first time I've experienced bad customer service as I've come here before and had to wait nearly 5 mins before even being acknowledged as i waited at the counter to place an order....gonna have to find a different robertos as my experiences here have gotten worse with each time!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Robertos. Always consistent. Robertos has made portions smaller to keep from raising their prices. This has been our go to Robertos as it is the closest to our house. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Better than Pink Taco at the Hard Rock for sure. Just sad that the Hard Rock bans all outside food. Thankfully Roberto's has a dining room! Open 24 Hours too!"}
{"text":"Went here yet again for an afternoon burrito craving. Carne asada burrito, double wrapped with just beans, cheese and rice...my my my was so very nice. Roberto's is awesome for that quick fix Mexican food (not as good as Fausto's but its closer to my house)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't rate this place as having fantastic Mexican food, but it's good and it's cheap.  They have several locations in the area and the menu has enough items to satisfy most diners."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years and the food has gotten better. Cooks do change in restaurants and sometimes just have a bad day so I take reviews with a grain of salt. It always looks clean and have never had any issues what so ever. The carne asada nacho's are really good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the way out to hoover dam.  Great food for a decent price.  The chimichanga is literally the best I have ever eaten.  Portions are huge!!  Atmosphere is very casual."}
{"text":"This Robertos location hovers between 2 and 3 stars. But, because it has on occasion sunk to 2 I'll have to go there. Why ? I've had to ask a worker to please not mop the floor with bleach while I'm  eating at table. You'd  think that would be common sense but I guess not. I hate to be an asshat but I just dont find clorox appetizing. On a recent visit,  I ordered 5 rolled tacos with everything.  Usually pretty dang good for a quick lunch -- well these rolled tacos had a noticeably fishy odor and taste to them so I'm assuming they were deep fried in oil used for fish,  instead of dropped in his ( the cooks ) gf 's panties.  I did not finish the tacos,  but the dogs loved them. Later,  I had a hellacious case of the squirts. Explosive. Smelly. And dangerous. I've  sworn off Robertos for awhile,  but I know I'll  be back at some point,  sorta like that nasty sexy booty call at 2 am. Lots of things sound better at zero dark thirty than they do in broad daylight."}
{"text":"This is where I had the best cheese enchilada I ever had in my entire lifetime.... I shit you not.  Oh sure, it was cheap and tawdry, full of that yummy sharp orange cheese.... and it was amazing.  I remember looking at it, eating it, and being absolutely taken aback.... I had visions of walking down the aisle in a grease-stained wedding dress, dragging a 6-foot enchilada to the alter... \"you may now devour your husband\".  AHAHHAA, okay, I'm a little sick.  If you are a cheese addict like I am, this will surely give you your fix.  Every time I go to Las Vegas, I try to stop here and get an enchilada.  Sometimes the simplest things in life can be memory-makers.  :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered no pico and guac , they put that . I say extra cheese ,they charge me for it . 3rd time they messed up my order . DONT GO HERE"}
{"text":"What I asked for :  Chili relleno burrito and chips with guacamole and cheese   What I got : chili relleno burrito with no beans and rice add guacamole and a carne asada burrito   First off, carne asada wasn't mentioned at all when I ordered. How I got a carne asada burrito, I'll never know.  My issues is when I informed the cashier (Rick at 4:07am) that my order was incorrect, instead of filling out my correct order, he charged me additionally for the chips with guacamole with the two incorrect burritos.   Luckily for Roberto's, no one goes for the service, but for the food. But no one should be charged in addition to their food when the employees mess up."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!!! Their service is fast when ordering take out and you can grab as much hot sauce as you would like. Roberto's is open 24 hours every day of the week so it's perfect after a night of partying or just to fulfill those late night cravings. I love their carne asada nachos, fries, and plates. The food at Roberto's is cheap and they give a generous portion of food so you'll definitely have leftovers."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Roberto's Taco Shop for a quick lunch one day, and have heard good things about this chain. Service was relatively fast, and you actually receive your food at the counter after you order before you pay for it. Prices were relatively inexpensive, especially considering the portion sizes.  I ended up trying something that I'd never had before: machaca. It was basically stir-fried shredded beef with egg and some onions/bell peppers. I thought it was pretty tasty, and was filling given the amount of egg, plus it was served with rice, beans, shredded lettuce, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. There is a small complimentary self-serve salsa and condiments bar on the side next to the soda fountain as well.  I also ordered an horchata to drink, and while it does not come with refills (in comparison to the fountain drinks that are located out in the dining area), it was served in a very large glass. In addition, when I asked for it without ice, they still filled up the cup all the way to the top! =)  I enjoyed my meal and while it was not a mind-blowing dining experience, Roberto's serves up solid food at affordable prices.  P.S. There are a few tables for dining in but the place is not that big if you have a large group or come during peak meal hours.  P.P.S. $0.50 surcharge for any credit/debit card payments."}
{"text":"I am such a fan, the guy the runs the cash register here is so friendly and I am such a regular he knows my order.  Big props on everything with my favs being the $4 Breakfast Burritos that I make two meals out of and the gaucumole tacos.  Keep it up"}
{"text":"What's up with the bad star rate here ... The food is decent and the service was good."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but my coworker just went and ordered 5 burritos. Only four were in the bag. When we called to notify them, they placed us on hold without informing us. Then rudely informed me there were five burritos in the bag when I'm looking at the bag and clearly there are only four. Also, they forgot to put our side order of sour cream in the bag that was charged and paid for. I understand mistakes happen and that's fine but when someone calls to inform you of the happening and you are rude and don't care.... and to top of off just hang up on me! That is not ok. Horrible customer service. But again it's Roberto's..."}
{"text":"These Mexicans know how to make some great food! There Burritos are the best I've ever had, the Chile Rellenos are the bomb, and I love there Tamales! I wish Metro Detroit had one of these Taco shops. Gracias !!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if i could.  They were instantly put out when I didn't speak spanish.  Rolled their eye at me when I asked if I could sub cheese for rice in a burrito and raised the price by $3.  If that's what it costs that's fine.  But robertos usually doesn't charge extra.  They were dishonest because they have poor work ethic and they are prejudice.  Go to Don tortaco.  Basically the exact same menu, but they are cheaper, taste better and are always nice."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service and I definely  recommend anything with their carne asadas meat!  Service is always faster than most places."}
{"text":"Love this location... Have been to many Robertos over the years and the food prepared at this location is a 10!  Always fresh no matter the time of day or night!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Mexican food but their CARNE ASADA FRIES is to die for! Minus the guacamole.  huge servings and really cheap."}
{"text":"I had digestion issues after eating here. I ordered a taco salad that was so saucy....it wasn't like a salad at all! I've eaten here before and the food was good so take your chances if you want."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Got some $12.00 Carne Asada Fries and it was minimal in carne , overloaded in cheese and the carne had fat all in it . We got through a quarter of the to go box and realized how terrible it was. We walked up and told them that they have failed us previously and now again and wanted a refund. They asked if we ate the fries OF COURSE WE HAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FOOD TO KNOW HOW BAD IT IS but no we ate it we don't get refund . They probably just throw all of it back in for the next bastard walking in.  We threw it away and vowed to never come back. My boyfriend spat on the ground as we left . DO NOT GO YOU WILL WASTE AN HOUR OF PAY . Wouldn't give my own dog this locations food."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Roberto's taco ever ate at the food basically was not even edible People did not know what they were doing behind the counter that place should be tested by the health inspectors my advisement stay away"}
{"text":"Their Carna Asada fries are amazing. People say to make sure you go to the Roberto's where you can see the kitchen and i have to agree. This Roberto's is right across from UNLV and its really great"}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican food when eating out. And it's great because they are located EVERYWHERE.  They make all their salsas in house and they are constantly prepping the fresh veggies. They have a free salsa bar for customers. My favorite side condiment is the spicy marinated carrots and cucumber slices on the side.  Prices are very reasonable and proportions are hefty.  There are the more \"greasy\" options, but you can choose to get healthy variations also."}
{"text":"The last couple of months The burritos have been going to pot...skimping on the meat big time, more than 50% of my chicken burrito was bell peppers and onions! YUCK   The chili burrito was also significantly smaller."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is for this place. Maybe it's because I'm hispanic and from Texas and know what real good mexican food taste like and this ain't it, sista!   I do think that the portions are huge for the price and that it's fast.  I agree with the convienence of location and it's smart business for those wating as their car is being detailed in the same parking lot.  I have only tried, the enchildas, rolled tacos and carne tacos and those were all bombs. NO Bueno, muchacho! Lets get some flavor in this food and stop overcooking the meat!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are big. I had the carnitas plate and it was good. My wife had the tamales and they were just okay."}
{"text":"Where to start...  Carne Asada tacos = very pretty but bland  Beef taco salad = very sloppy and bland  Chicken enchiladas were swimming in a soup and meat was bland.. How does sour cream not come with the enchiladas?  Fries were good, just a tad too much salt :/  Just don't"}
{"text":"I've been going to Roberto's Taco Shop for over 30 years. Nothing fancy but still really good food. This time I had the three rolled beef tacos and three different burritos. ((Had to take some home of course.)) The carne asada burrito is a big favorite of mine. I had them add in sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Awesome!!! You should try it that way. I also got a beef and bean with cheese. Again, simple but good. Their red and green sauces are actually pretty decent plus they have a little complementary salad bar which is nice of them. I got to meet Roberto Robledo several years ago while helping him with a Grand Opening. He was a really nice guy and as big as an NFL linebacker. Two enthusiastic thumbs up for Roberto's Taco Shop. Celebrating 50 years in the business!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish Roberto's would come to Indianapolis!! Their authentic Mexican cuisine at great prices drew me in, and the deliciousness had me craving more by the next day. The portions are huge and definitely filling while the price is right on point. I can't wait to try their breakfast burrito before I leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with our visit here.  1st they gave our order away which doubled our waiting time. We waited almost 20 minutes for some fries and 3 tacos!?!?  2nd they tried giving us the wrong order twice.  Ugghh I hate leaving bad reviews but this place put a sour taste in my mouth... When they gave us our order no thank you, no sorry, nothing. Probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately choose to eat here the other night 5-5-18 and while I Was waiting for my food to be prepared my friend noticed that the older Hispanic male I was working in the kitchen wasn't wearing any gloves.I was taken back by this and didn't say anything. When I got home I threw out my food. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything at the time of the incident and request my money back. The last thing I need while I am on vacation is food poisoning"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad, but it's definitely not my favorite Mexican food. That being said, I haven't tried everything.   I really liked the prices for their specials. I got the tostada with rice and beans which was $4.75, and included a drink. I ordered it with beef, but now I'm wishing I got the chicken. The beef was too salty for my tastes. I ended up eating pretty much everything except for that. The rice was pretty bomb. The beans were good, too. Both of those tasted just as good as what my mom would make.   My husband ordered the carne asada burrito and loved it, so maybe I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Not complaining about the food but the service. Repeated my order twice and the guy behind the counter still got it wrong and when I told him he argued with me for 5min that I ordered this. Worst service ever!! They should give receipts out..such a chaotic mess in there. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.  The \"Adobada Taco\" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the \"Rolled Tacos\" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the \"Carne Asada Fries\" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone.   Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube.   I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a \"Chicken Taco\" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The \"Rolled Tacos\" and \"Carne Asada Fries\" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the \"Carne Asada Burrito\" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff!    They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays."}
{"text":"Service here is spotty and the wait is always at last 20 minutes. During a lunch rush could be longer. Food isn't that great of quality either."}
{"text":"I stop by this Roberto's for lunch from time to time and they are pretty consistent at this location. I mostly stop by on Wednesday because chicken tacos are just 99 cents (limit of 12 per customer) and they have a drive-thru so I can grab my food and go. I've been inside a couple times and it has been clean however I mostly use the drive-thru. The cashiers are friendly and they actually repeat your order back to you making sure it's correct. If you are paying with anything other than cash, they will add a fee for running the card.  Bean and Cheese Burrito ($2.85) - It's a huge flour tortilla filled with you guess it, beans and cheese. This is a meal all by itself for me. The beans are made from scratch and grate the cheese on site. All of the burritos are fairly priced for the size and what you get.    Chicken Taco ($2.35) - It's kind of hard to come here and pay full price for these when they are just 99 cents every Wednesday. That's why I only order them on hump day. The tacos are fried, so they have a greasiness to them, but I like it. Any of the tacos here are perfect after a night of drinking!  Beef Taco ($2.35) - Fried like the chicken taco, but with shredded beef inside. These are my favorite tacos here and they don't skimp on the fillings.   3 Rolled Tacos (2.35) - You can choose chicken or beef and it comes with two types of cheeses on top. For the price this is a tasty deal. You can add guac and sour cream for a $1.15 more.   Carne Asada Fries ($8.10) - This is a huge portion and can easily be shared. Fries topped with beans, sour cream, guac, salsa, cheese and carne asada. They are generous with all the toppings and the fries surprisingly don't get too soggy with all that's piled on top of them.   Cheese Quesadilla ($2.85) - They use on e of their huge flour tortillas for this and a good amount of cheese."}
{"text":"This location is in a strip mall and parking can be tight if it's Wednesday. Roberto's is a hole in the wall taco joint that's to most of us locals only acceptable food after a late night of drinking, but it's worn on me in the last year-ish when Wednesday rolls around and chicken tacos that are regularly priced at $2.35 are only $.99 cents and a limit of 12 per customer. There is no drive-thru at this location and it gets really busy, so wait times (usually on Wednesday) can be 30 minutes, no joke. People are all loading up on chicken tacos and it looks like they only fit about 12-14 in each basket of the fryer at a time. At least you know it's fresh!  Chicken Tacos ($2.35 regularly and $.99 cents on Wednesday) - The chicken tacos are fried and come with shredded chicken, cheddar and cotija cheese with lettuce inside. They are greasy and good. The chicken has a good flavor and you can't beat the price. I wish they were consistent at this location with the tacos. Sometimes they are overloaded with chicken and cheese (yay!) and sometimes they are skimpy. You can ask for the taco to be modified, but if it's Wednesday when the line is to the door you just might get a funny eye from the person taking your order lol. My hubby had the nerve once to ask for no lettuce on his tacos and will not make that mistake again!   Cheese Quesadilla ($2.85) - I appreciate that 'berto's offers a really tasty quesadilla at a fair price. Some places really overcharge for something so simple. Here they use a huge flour tortilla and a good amount of cheese that actually tastes good.   3 Rolled Tacos ($2.35) - You can choose chicken or beef, I usually pick beef. They roll up the meat in a corn tortilla, fry it and cover it with 2 types of cheese. If you want guacamole with the cheese on top it's $3.50. I don't like the guacamole here, so I ask them to substitute the guac for sour cream.  Bean and Cheese Burrito ($2.85) - Priced right and huge! Problem is the beans are totally hit and miss. They put a good amount of freshly grated cheddar cheese inside, but the beans are not always consistent when it comes to flavor and texture.   FYI if you want to add sour cream, cheese or guacamole to anything it's $1.10 extra. Inside has a good amount of tables and there is a bathroom."}
{"text":"I come here often because it's close to my house and the food is decent (better than McDonald's ) but they mess up a lot.   Well today i called ahead and ordered to go.  There was a new voice on the phone this time.  Kind of clueless so I assumed she was new.   We get our order and drive all the way home.  We were charge almost $30 for rolled tacos, a quesadilla and a carne Asada plate.  Get home and no quesadilla.   My cranes Asada plate was put in the bag side ways so the beans and everything came out.   I called to tell them what happened and missing order and the older lady gets on the phone and says \"so what do you want ?! Your money back or come back\" I said I will come back.    We head all the way back. Return my spilled plate.  Got a new plate and a the missing quesadilla. I sent in my 12 year old to get it.   The new girl gives her the food.  No sorry.  Nothing.  Managed to try to punk her tho \"I didn't give you the food this way.  You don't properly take care of it\" ummmm what?! I had to drive all the way home and all the way back because they didn't put an item I was charged and paid for in my bag!! And we are at fault ?! Wtf.   She was rude and unapologetic completely.   I have been given the wrong order several time and this is the second time I had an item missing and that's the response? Ok.  I'm in customer service and have been for 20 years and would never talk to a customer that way.  Especially a regular.  Or someone so young.  My daughter stopped me from going inside and shoving her face in my food.  She's  would've never spoke to me that way so I'm assuming she felt brave trying to talk down to a 12 year old   I will never be back. The food isn't worth it.  Over priced.  Rude cashier.  Reading through these reviews that are so recent are clearly talking about this new girl.  I will NEVER be back because of her.  Good job Robertos"}
{"text":"The food here it horrible. Their steak tastes like it was boiled, just rubbery with no flavor. I ordered Tacos with just meant and sour cream. The tacos were $3.50 and they charged another $2.00 for cheese and sour cream. So it ended up being $5.50 each for nasty tacos. My wife ordered a tostada, she took 2 bites and threw the rest away. Even the kids tossed their food. The only thing that got eaten was the rice. I'd just try and avoid this place all together."}
{"text":"Small place with a walk up window to place your order and pay for your food. They have a small salsa bar with salsas and pickled veggies, cucumbers, limes, etc. Food is always fresh and delicious. Love the carnitas fries."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get tasty, affordable food right next to the Hard Rock Hotel. Excellent menu and excellent Mexican"}
{"text":"This restaurant is up the street from my bf's house but even if we had to go across town for their food we would!   The service is not nothing to write about though. But the food is excellent.   And they have a self serve bar with salsa and other condiments you like."}
{"text":"Love this location. We literally live across the street and it's our go to stop after a few drinks. The staff is always super friendly and the salsa bar is clean and fresh even at like 3 am. Fast service and food always tastes good, I'm from Tucson and I appreciate Mexican food done quickly that still tastes great."}
{"text":"Walked in at  8:45 pm, floor clean, Tatiana greeted us at the front counter the daughter to the owners, my friend Raymond and I, ordered the California burrito and I had the breakfest burrito, I feel the bacon could have been a bit more crunchy, but still delicious.  We will be going for the Wednesday chicken tacos for 99 cents.   ~Michael Usaj"}
{"text":"I hope I don't get sick because the guy with the white mustache decided that he didn't want to wear gloves or have clean hands when he put my potatoes on the Grill. And the booty didn't even use soap and he washed his hands I hate how I get to experience all the disgusting horrible behaviors that human beings portray I hate it it sucks"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised. Food was tasty, fresh and quick, and also inexpensive.  This location is clean and organized.  Recommend for a quick meal with good quality, sort of fast food plus."}
{"text":"Great food. I used to live close and pass it on my home form work. Whenever my wife and I didn't feel like cooking dinner we'd usually pick up Roberto's. Food that's worth the money."}
{"text":"Just like the other Roberto's it has good food. It's made quick. When I think about getting take out my first thought is Roberto's. If you're looking for Mexican fast food, Roberto's is the place to go."}
{"text":"You go here for anything Carne Asada. Their Guac has chile verde in it to give it a nice kick as well. Taquitos aren't bad either."}
{"text":"The only reason that I gave this place 2 stars was because of the carne asada burrito. My breakfast burrito with carne asada was so dry and I could make one way better at home myself. My chicken taco was so bland I think the meat was prepped for the nursing home with no seasoning or a pinch of salt. Heck my horchata was even mediocre.   I saw reviews saying the burritos were huge and could full you up, not true. My husband and I ate a burrito and taco, and he still went to the fridge and made himself a sandwich afterwards. We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to kayak and needed a big snack prior to going.... we found this little gem and let me tell you... bomb! We went back a second day and almost wanted it for dinner. The green salsa is sooo good. We did breakfast burritos, and loved them. Look at those pix! Yummo!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 5, but there's the one thing - I'll bring that up later. First of all, they gave us WAY too much food for our dollar. Not complaining, but man, a lot of food. The carnitas were the best we've had in a very, very long time. The carnitas were crisp in places, spiced just right, with a perfect texture. Last time I had carnitas that good was about 8 years ago in Mexico. The tortilla was so hot and fresh. That, alone, would warrant 5 stars. The service was friendly and fast. And, they're open 24 hours. These guys are walking distance from my hotel. Perfect! My one and only complaint is that the taco shell of my taco was overcooked and too hard. But, everything, everything else was perfecto!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I got some chicken enchiladas and they were delicious! I'm from Los Angeles originally so it's hard to find good Mexican food compared to LA but here it is!! My New Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"It's Roberto's! What's there to complain about?! Not necessarily what I call \"Mexican food\"  but close enough. Beats Taco  Bell?!! ha ha!   When visiting a Robertos its usually because either A. I'm hungover or B. huge craving for Carne Asada nachos. Nobody gets down on Carne Asada Nachos like Bertos! This location is close to work so I am seen here occasionally on a Monday or Friday during lunch. The cooks are friendly and nice and usually on top of their game. The establishment is somewhat clean, but can make some improvements. Floors are kinda dirty, tables are not always clean and their salsa bar is more often than not out/low on my favorite green salsa. Also, because I'm Mexican, i love to fill up the plastic sandwich bag with cucumbers and squeeze in a few limes.....well, their cucumbers are usually yellowish in color and not looking all that great! :-( Gave up on the idea that I will ever get these at this location."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE is GOOD. I will definitely be coming back. OVER and OVER.  It's like, they make each ingredient of your order great, on its own. Then, when they combine them into your food, it's BOMB. Try it out. All these reviews aren't getting it wrong!  But caveat: Although it is a franchise, they have an issue they should fix and the gentleman at the counter said is true: A problem with CONSISTENCY.  That is, not all the Roberto's Taco Shops foods are made the same. So, THIS SPECIFIC location's food is good in a different way than all the others. They get to prepare food differently, location to location.  This Roberto's is GREAT! Five Stars!"}
{"text":"I dont know why but I am always craving for Mexican food. I just love how this Roberto is soooooooo close to my house and is OPEN 24 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The shrimp burrito is my favorite on the menu, and with their green salsa, isnt this the best dinner I can get in my area? The fries are delicious too."}
{"text":"This Robertos is new, large , the food is exceptional. Numeral 1 Robertos.. This place is so clean..."}
{"text":"day 17 already  i think of that song. should i stay or should i go now. if i stay there will be trouble. if i go there will be double. i miss my family already and waking up to an empty house in vegas. maybe i should have stayed in portland longer. but the idea of me staying anywhere too long sounds dreadful and me leaving places seems to upset others. my dad is getting really old...  damn i feel worthless today. like i haven't accomplished anything in a while. i'm hungry. i need a burrito. i came here on the recommendation of a friend i am staying with. without jiu jitsu friend and yelp friends i would be really screwed. this place is in an area thats being bulldozed and redeveloped. the inside is typical mexican taco spot. the burritos are huge and cheap! very cheap. i had a chorrizo burrito for breakfast and now i need a nap."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's! Whenever I crave Mexican food it is usually Roberto's or Pepe's! I go to Roberto's for the carne asada fries. Although it is a huge portion it is a great meal. I'm here at least once a month for their fries!"}
{"text":"Well let me see. Where should I start. My wife and I came to Robertos because its normally a safe option for fast Mexican food. We came in and tge lady behind the counter did not even great us. We placed our order and the cook kept on looking at us with an attitude.  He made us feel like we were disturbing his day. The food came out fast and tasted good as Robertos always does. However the service at this location sucks. They are rude and make customers feel uncomfortable in the building.  Two stars because of the food."}
{"text":"Bathrooms were disgusting and we saw a  cockroach just passing by our table as we were eating"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try after months of not having it. Biggest mistake ever.  My husband ordered a Carne asada torta, the meat was undercooked and the bread was hard.  I ordered two chicken tacos, the oil was leaking out of the bag. We couldn't eat it. The bowl of cereal was much better. Definitely doesn't deserve the one star."}
{"text":"Aside of the cashier lady who looks like she's smelling shit. They are fast, the price is good and the food is better."}
{"text":"Aha! a bright green painted wall with a large inscripted \"Roberto's Taco Shop\" inside this shop transports me here, even on an early morning to get a stomach-filling Mexican meal. In Vegas 24 hour restaurants and businesses is not a surprise but I like it that this is open 24 hours! in this westside neighborhood in the proximity of South Jones and the Highway 215. This is one of several Roberto's Taco Shops in Vegas.   My ever favorite Chicken Enchiladas wrapped in soft tortillas generously heaped with chicken and cheese. (#6 on the menu with a Chicken Taco). With the addition of lemon, cilantro, cucumber slices, pickled carrots with onions, green jalapeno peppers from the Salsa Bar, it is much of a meal. Green or red chile sauces and salsa sauces are extra choices to perk up the meal adding zesty spiciness. Otherwise, pick your choices from the Salsa Bar.   Ordering is from the menu posted above the service counter. Popular Mexican fare such as burritos, tacos, carnitas, enchiladas, asadas with rice or beans and many more choices. No available printed menu or even a \"take-out\" menu. Noticeably, an absence of Mexican food aroma. No smell of cooking? Must have a very strong air cooking suction filter or air purifier system? Unlike other places of eatery or small restaurants, aaah this place is a smell of clean and it appears well attended to. Modern dining furnishings in granite-like table and padded seats. Service staff and kitchen staff is amiable, patient, and helpful. Prompt sevice. To the far right side of the shop is where beverages can be poured to beverage cup.   It's well-lit at night, shop's neon red signs are visible from the road. Notably from a flyer poster, Wednesdays are 99 cents Chicken Taco Day!"}
{"text":"I came here on August 31st, my husband ordered three tacos, and we decided to eat there. There was no one else in the joint, and we waited about 5 minutes. The tacos came, and my husband tells me he ordered them soft, so I told him I would go and return them. I told the girl who was working and she said \"he didn't say soft\" I was taken aback so I told her if that was the case I would pay extra for giving us soft tacos. I think I was very nice. She then says \" if I do that, I'll throw those ones out\" so I say \" so I'm stuck with these.\" Which she turns around and starts talking with her crew.  What makes this worse is I contacted the company with no response. It's one thing to have a rude crew, it's another for a company not to care. Terrible, I should of read all the reviews first."}
{"text":"Another good branch of Roberto's Taco Shop. The breakfast burrito hits the spot after a night is drinking."}
{"text":"This location is finally reopened after their remodel! It's SOOOO much cleaner and nicer inside. Food is still awesome!"}
{"text":"honestly I used to love this place but the whole company is a joke. lately they have been messing up the simplest of an order. the first few times I've ordered they looked at me strange for requesting potatoes in my burrito. if you don't like potatoes in yours, that's fine. however, it's MY food that I am ordering and I am the one paying for it. neglecting to add something to my burrito because you disagree with it isn't part of your job. this morning just sent it waaaay over what I thought their problem was. again, I requested a burrito with carne, cheese, rice and potatoes. I get home and what's in my burrito? FRENCH FRIES. I know damn well they offer diced potatoes for their burritos so I know this is just a laughing matter on their end. it's rude and ignorant to change someone's order to something completely different than how its originally made. french fries and diced potatoes are two completely different items and tastes. I wasn't asking for the cure to cancer or their first born so I don't see why they motioned to do this. maybe it was a mistake (doubt it), or maybe they are just pissed about their current employment and don't care to do things right. but at the end of the day, that's not my problem!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is one of those Vegas places that can vary from place to place. One expects they do not have exacting standards for all their locations as you will often find differences in the recipe from one shop to another.   Of course, the service will always differ between the various locations around the city. But this Roberto's, in a rather unassuming neighborhood of East Vegas, offers an excellent mix of all the good things you come to expect from the chain.  A recent remodeling may have had an impact on this place. I don't know what it looked like before, but it looks good now and I think that has an affect on the staff as they are friendly and do an all-around good job.   The food is as good as any location in town and the portions and price are what have made Roberto's a local favorite."}
{"text":"This is a great place for cheap Mexican food in the wee hours of the night. It's not gourmet but it's tasty, quick and inexpensive. Their carnitas tacos, bean tostadas and churros are my favs here."}
{"text":"Good mexican fast food.  Not special... But definitely better than the other shit fast food options that are around.  Fresh produce, decent guac, meat seems to be fresh too...  It's just nothing special.  I won't be craving Roberto's, but if I'm looking for a quick bite and they're around, it's a done deal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always liked it... But today was a BAD day .., I ordered the rolled tacos with the guacamole on the side, plus a side order of sour cream, $1.10 for a drop of sour cream, that's ridicules ... I not being cheap but come on... The food was so so and no wow factor , I think it's a bit over priced for bland food .. What I found to be very disturbing was a guy sitting at one of the tables conducting some sort of business with the employees, they'd pay him and follow him to his van and come back with clothing , one guy came back with a jacket .. The seller came back in and another employee bought stuff from him..  Im all for people making money.. BUT NOT on company time , just didn't look right and customers were inside"}
{"text":"By far, hands down, the BEST taco/burrito place in Vegas for a take out place.  I love fried foods, even though I try not to eat it a lot.  Out of all the Mexican places I've eaten at in Las Vegas, California and Arizona, Roberto's houses the best chimichanga ever.  There is a Roberto's in Arizona, but it is literally 50 miles away from my home.  I miss Roberto's.  It's one of the things that I loved about living in Vegas -- it was 24 hours."}
{"text":"With these being on almost every other corner in town you would think they are the same, you would be wrong. I order mostly the same items when at Roberto's and I can say this location makes them the best. I am a breakfast burrito fan and create my own version of their menu item. Some extra bacon, no potatoes, and just a little cheese, this item has me coming back quite frequently."}
{"text":"I get the Roberto's craving from time to time and my weakness is their breakfast  burrito with bacon, extra bacon. I always get it with no potato or pico and little cheese and add guacamole. Though this is not my local store it is closest to work. On a two occasions they messed up my order. The line at the drive through is always slow. I have given up on this store and need to find a new morning fix."}
{"text":"Being the closest to my house I frequent this one the most. I love their breakfast burritos so that is my go to when visiting Roberto's. They always seem to cook the bacon to that perfect crispness, as it should be and they don't load it up with cheese, just the way I like it. I have tried a few other locations that just do not compare to this one."}
{"text":"I come to Roberto's Taco shop because it is a quick bit, a quick fix to eat and right around the corner from where I live. I also like it because every time the food is made to order fresh and never a bad experience. You get what you pay for food wise, a decent order about $7-9 dollars and food to fill you up and even have leftovers. There are times I have noticed that the females are more generous in the food orders then the male cooks. It seems they give a bit more food to your order while the guys during mid day and night just get it done. I come about once a week. Never a \"bad\" experience but still quality you can taste and know is fresh."}
{"text":"Fantastic beef tacos!  We go here every time we are in Vegas!! It's a must on out todo list.  One time we ate here twice in one day."}
{"text":"I've tryed over and over again when hunger strikes and theres nothing else to give these guys a chance in the hopes for decent mexican meal but I get nothing except embarrassment that they call this food. It is an insult to food everywhere.   I ordered a beef chimichanga ...at first it looked great and tasty! It was this huge masive tortilla and it smelled great!   But then the first bite came and wow, I could have spit it out but I couldnt.  The beef was obviously sitting in a mushed pile of old stock and vegetables on the warmer for several hours. The tomatoes were flavorless still green disgusting cheap product. The beans.......omg, really?  How the hell do you ruin beans!!!  They were tasteles and runny!   I tried to eat it in the hopes that at least one bite would taste good but that never happened. At every bite I only kept thinking that I wasted 6 dollars !   I feel sorry for those who give Roberto's a high rating because they have never had good mexican food to realize the kind of junk that they serve. I would have rather had a chalupa at taco bell...  What a shame."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast burrito, big enough for two, great red hot sauce, cheep breakfast! Horchata not so good, kinda ucky..."}
{"text":"The last time I checked, a California Burrito has Fries in it, not a shitload of grilled onions and rice. Using shit thats just laying around to put in a burrito because someone is coming to the Drive-Thru and you know the odds are they wont notice until its too late to come back, shows just how some locations can be compared to Del Taco rather than an authentic restaurant.  Will not visit this one again!  This location's performance will also contribute to it's falling in the rankings on LasVegasBestTacos.com when the new rankings are released!  Stay away from this location!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Probably smallest Burrito I've ever gotten from any Roberto's in the 20 years I've been in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Another location that is pre-cooking their Carne Asada, then reheated when ordered. Tough as leather and overcooked. This trend will only take them farther downhill!"}
{"text":"I like Roberto's, but you might as well be eating inside an old school casino with the amount of cigarette smoke that wafts over from the neighboring gaming bar. Vegas sucks in terms of their lax smoking laws, so to be bombarded by smoke in an establishment where it's prohibited is extra annoying."}
{"text":"This place is crazy crazy crazy good! My car broke down and my tow truck driver recommended it, I know totally random right! However they don't have this in Reno... Where I'm from. I was literally driving along saw the sign and turned in.  To be honest with you it's not really someplace I would normally turn into or would going to eat because it's kind of in a bad neighborhood and it doesn't look like it would be one of my favorite spots from the outside.   I pulled up to the window and gave my order to the woman in the drive-through. She was nice enough, nothing to really write home about. When they handed me my bag of food I swear it weighed about a pound and a half. I was NOT EXPECTING THAT!  I ordered a beef burrito... Nothing fancy no extras and no subtractions. It came with a few napkins fresh red sauce and fresh green sauce. This thing was the most amazing Barito I literally have ever eaten in my life!  The tortilla was fresh in the meet was fresh there was no fat in it it was layered and layered and layered with flavor there wasn't too much beans and rice and all of that filler. This order exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. I would drive all the way across town just to see what else they have to offer!  Awesome!! And QUICK!"}
{"text":"I just noticed a recent review near me. I go here a lot too. I have to agree it is good mexican food anytime of the day or night at a fair price. I just wish they spoke more English lol."}
{"text":"Love Roberto's Taco Shop. Food is so reasonable and so delicious. Customer service is A+ and they give service with a smile.  Since there is so much to choose from, it's hard to make a decision as to what you want to eat--it's all so good, so you can't go wrong. The portions served are more than enough. You will be full, satisfied & more than likely, have leftovers that you'll want to reheat for later. Their salsa bar gives you every spicy condiment, fresh and homemade. The place is clean and gives you a comfortable feeling when you first walk in."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I ever had.  It gave me food poisoning. Upset stomach. I am new in Vegas. I saw Roberts taco shops all over the town . I thought it must be good, so tried last night. It was so horrible I left the food unfinished. I will never go there again. Taco Bell is even batter then this."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through on our way home from an event and ordered carne asada fries. Got fries with no carne asada. When I called I was told I have to bring back the food and the receipt within 5 hours for them to \"fix\" it. Only I don't live near there! So I would have to drive back and waste my gas and time to get the food I ordered and paid for. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"Roberto's is the real deal.  Cheap, fast, authentic Mexican food that is a chain in Vegas for at least two decades.  Came in and got my favorite that I ordered for a long time, a quesadilla that was $2 and had half a pound of cheese, hola momma cita. Shared with my friend two rolled tacos with guacamole for $6.  Damn.  Can't beat these prices.  Can't beat the greasy, oily goodness.  The patio furniture passing for tables and chairs is nothing to note and of course it's fast food so don't have expectations of fine dining.  Grab a plastic fork and a lot of napkins and dive in because it's a delicious endeavor.  Sometimes the employees don't speak English the best but they are friendly and understand what you order.  You get your food quickly too.  Food: 4 Service: 5 Ambiance: 2 Parking: 4"}
{"text":"Two out of three times I've eaten there I've had a good experience. Dinner was good, breakfast was good but lunch was not.  Called in an order, went to pick it up and someone else had taken it. Not a big deal they were busy. The only issue I had was when the lady at the register asked the cooks about it the two cooks gave her a \"so what not my problem\" response.  I'll still go back but probably not for lunch"}
{"text":"Had a couple shredded beef tacos from this Robertos for lunch and the beef didn't have any of the normal flavoring.  Service was good, but food needs a little work to be as good as some of the other Robertos in town."}
{"text":"I like this place! Excellent food at a great price and it's quick. I had the chicken taco/enchilada combo for $6.50. How can you beat that. Not a fast food assembly-line burger, sandwich, or whatever in a TV land atmosphere, so why the three stars only. Because as good as this place is, and it is, 4 and 5 stars should be for places where you're being seated and served, that have table cloths and waiters, views and desserts.  Not trying to be snobbish just explaining my idea of the rating system. Eat here, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I show up at roberto's at 5:20am to buy breakfast. Supposedly they are open 24 hours. The lights are on inside as well as the big red neon 24 hours sign. The employees are sitting on the table inside the door drinking their coffee and eating. I pull on the door but it's locked. The two men inside turn around and shoo me away...no explanation NOTHING! What kind of business does that?!? Worst ever. With so many different options around, I'm never going back again!"}
{"text":"Been two days in a row. Day 1: Carne Asada Breakfast burrito, good flavor and lots of carne, no potatoes and very little egg. Turned out to be a carne and cheese burrito but was still good. Day 2: Bacon Breakfast Burrito; lots of potato almost no egg and cheese with a right amount of bacon. It was a good bacon and potato burrito.  The tortillas are really good and the salsa is awesome!"}
{"text":"We placed a take out order and everything was ok....until we tasted the red sauce from the self serve bar.  It had gone bad and was spoiled.  When we called the restaurant to tell them what happened, the girl who answered the phone said \"complain to the corporation, I just work here.\"  We called again to talk to a manager and she said \"we don't have a manager on duty, and no one else has complained about it but you.\"  My husband tried telling her the sauce was bad and she needed to take it away.  She did not want to be bothered and that was that!  I am shocked because we've ordered from this particular Roberto's numerous times and always had great service/food.  Never.....ever again will we eat at Roberto's again.  They obviously do not care if the food goes bad and their customers get sick.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Quick service, people were friendly, stopped in at 1 in the morning and the food was really good ordered beef chimichanga daughter had tacos she wasn't too happy with that but its good quality food.  Will visit again before I leave Las Vegas looking to try their Menudo"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a breakfast staple for me. The pure simplicity of everything is the most attractive part of this place. That's what I appreciate the most about this place and franchise. Its 24 hours, so me stopping by here before I go to work at 7:30 am is not a problem. You go in you stand in line you look at the extensive yet straight forward menu, you order and pay, and BAM you're done! I normally order the carne asada breakfast burrito (steak eggs and cheese in a tortilla grilled on the grill ), and less than a few minutes after I get my receipt I'm out that thang.   The food isn't overly seasoned, and to be honest theres nothing to special about them. But I guess that's what makes them so good. It's easy and the food is exactly what it says. The burritos are about the size of a human baby (okay not that big but it's definitely a double fister). I can easily eat half in the morning and be full until lunch and eat the other. The prices have went up unfortunately by a dollar or so, but the quality of the food hasn't been sacrificed. The restaurant has a bar full of condiments jalapenos, hot salsas, vegetables to dress your food. I'm a regular customer and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Friendlier than a lot of others :) so good n dont know how I would live without robertos near unlv thank u"}
{"text":"Best Robertos that I know around vegas excellent staff.bean and cheese burrito every time is on point:)"}
{"text":"This is THEE after hours, after clubbing, SOOO drunk eating staple!  Must SAMPS: Horchata   (Pronounced: WHORE-chata) When I first moved here, I swear, I drank their horchata more than water itself."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Robertos in town....so glad it is here!! yeah!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped really quick for food, and we visit this location at least once a week, even if it's just a drink. But Fernando tonight was amazing! Service was great! He was polite and helpful, and just had an overall great service. We love Roberto's and was very very happy with him tonight! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Roberto's in Vegas.  I have tried many and I think the one by campus is the most generous with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, etc.  It's a lil hole-in-the-wall but it's open 24 hours and has great, cheap food... relatively fast.  Can't beat that!    When I lived in Vegas, I used to go here at least once a week.  Sometimes more!  Try the Horchata too. It's a Mexican rice drink (with a lil cinammon).  It's yummy and good for the stomach if you've been drinking!"}
{"text":"Friend recommended recommended recommended to try the carnita fries. After I ordered it I was blew away by the size. I had to share it. So much goodness but my stomach didn't agree but still ate. I also tried a couple of things like fish tacos and I think the beef tongue tamales."}
{"text":"Came back here recently and it is getting better.  The cashier was super nice and accommodating on more than one occasion and they finally got the order right!  But, the lines are pretty long and it takes a long time to get some grub here.  The green sauce tasted kind of weird the first time I started coming around and it still hasn't changed.  Plus side is that this location has a soda/juice fountain unlike the one by my house."}
{"text":"Roberto's would be laughed out of sf mission...but. They serve up some pretty good and cheap grub. I  love their carnitas tacos and their fish tacos are pretty good as well ( a fried piece of fish). The tortillas are pretty good. Their guac is very blah...not fresh. Burritos are good not great.  Their combo plates are also pretty good served with nice rice and refried beans.  Prices are really good....aka cheap. Tacos 2.50-300 each Burritos are 4-5 bucks. Plates 8-10 bucks.  Open 24/7....perfect after a late night of drinking."}
{"text":"Just your run-of-the-mill mexican taco shop. not clean, bland food, and nothing is homemade. plan to sit on the pot for a few hours after eating here. if you like cheap food with a cheap cost (think Applebee's or Chili's) then I'm sure you'll find this place amazing for the cost."}
{"text":"I stopped here with some friends when heading to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for a day trip. I had heard their food was delicious, inexpensive, and authentic, so I couldn't wait to give them a try. It is a very casual place where you order at the counter and then sit down to wait for your food and eat. The wait was short and the food was definitely inexpensive and very plentiful when it arrived, I got a huge playful of food for only a couple of bucks. I personally am not the biggest fan because I did not think the food tasted very good or authentic. Nothing about my dish as well as my friends' that I tried stuck out... it was not especially flavorful or good quality. The guacamole was just meh. I will likely not be back here."}
{"text":"Employee does not understand English! I had to repeat myself several times at drive threw. I tried to add a coke to my order but was ignored. Waited in drive threw way to long. My order was wrong when I got to window. On top of that there is a .50 cent charge for using a card. The food tasted fine."}
{"text":"All tacos are pre made in the morning. Wanted taco dinner with soft shells. They won't give you them with plain meat. All there meat is pre made with all vegetables included. I can't eat tomatoes so definitely not a place to go if you have certain food allergies."}
{"text":"Ok, so growing up in san diego I remember the original real robertos.  This now chain quenches my taste buds for a bit till I can get back to san diego to have better taco shop food.  Most robertos here are still good, but thisone, well thisone plain sucks.  Cant tell why, the meat is always tough, burritos are smaller, food is burnt.  This is the only robertos in town I would not go to.  Dirty also..."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly because I work in the parking lot. We do have tons of choices nearby but I still eat here more than the other places in our lot. Mainly because I have so many favorites on the menu that it makes it tough to get old. I usually call in my order then walk over.   This is not my favorite robertoes and definitely not the most consistent location.   The main reason they get 3 stars is because it is a total gamble that my food comes as ordered, I bet it comes right about 65% of the time. When it comes wrong it is still good though, just not as I ordered it. For example, I like to order a #4 no rice extra beans in it's place... They mess that up a lot. Or chorizo burrito add potato add cheese, also commonly botched. They have never messed up my carne asada burrito tho...  All in all, good food at a good price. Quick and tasty in a valley of terrible Mexican food. Try not to customize your order. And do yourself a favor and grab some of the free jalapeño soaked carrots at the salsa station!"}
{"text":"Needed some food before we headed back to Cali.. My babe wanted Smash burger .. But the smell of bomb Mexican food was captivating.. So I decided to eat @ Robertos instead.. The burritos were bomb .. On a fresh giant flour tortilla... Carne asada pick de gallo and guacamole... Hmmmm .. My son ordered a a  carne asada breakfast burrito .. It only had carne eggs n cheese.. N was delish. Prices are more than what I'm used to paying decent for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"They just opened when I got here. I got the carne asada burrito and it was massive. And it was just a little bit above $6. Get it with pico de gallo and guac, if they ask. I mistakenly got it without guac and it's a bit dry. But that was my mistake. Also get some lemon wedges and extra sauce at the salad bar."}
{"text":"What happened to the green salsa, guacamole and burrito size??? I'm a regular customer of robertos. I always order the same thing.  Bit the green salsa I got, is sooo watery and the guacamole container becomes smaller and the burrito went to the gym and lose some weight hehe. Bad. I guess I'll be going to another robertos."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for some quick Mexican food, you gotta love Roberto's.  I love their red salsa, I don't know why they don't sell it in stores. They have the cool little salsa bar with red and green salsa, pickled jalapeños, pickled carrots, cucumbers and radishes. If you are famished, or sharing with someone, try the  carne asada fries (huge portion)."}
{"text":"If you want some decent Mexican food at any time of the day, this is the spot. There's several locations all around the city and I'm sure there's one near you. The food is always consistent as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good place if you're looking for a cheap Mexican food place, I always get the breakfast burrito with bacon and it's pretty quick (5-10 minutes) every time."}
{"text":"been to a few valley locations & this one is still my favorite. a little bias review since we come here so often the staff recognize us as soon as we walk in. but, whatev. =)  ham&cheese breakfast burrito with green sauce, SO YUM!  sometimes the self serve bar area is completely destroyed but the staff is pleasant enough that if you ask for something not so iffy looking, they most always help you out."}
{"text":"It's not my favorite Roberto's but it will do.    Conveniently located on Cactus in Southern Highlands, this is your usual faster than a sit-down restaurant but slower than a drive-thru Mexican fare.  I only hit this location if I am in the area grocery shopping.  The restaurant is always clean, but they seem to be extraordinarily slow here.  I often find at least four people waiting for orders at any given time.  The staff is always very nice and apologetic, but I've been coming here for years and they are still slow."}
{"text":"Cheese,sour cream and gauc fries are delicious! I live in the area and come here often, the staff is usually friendly. A fake smile is all I need to make me happy!"}
{"text":"I had my hopes up since I'm familiar with the franchise, but was disappointed. The guacamole wasn't that good, and the meat on my tacos was dry. It was towards the end of the night though so maybe they were trying to work through what they already had before closing up.   I imagine there's more Mexican options out there in Boulder City, will check those out instead next time."}
{"text":"Not much to look at but it's my second time here. The tacos are good my only gripe was no onions/cilantro on the bar or on the carne asada tacos. They still tasted good. Best thing is it's 24hrs and cheap."}
{"text":"Although I also REALLY enjoy Mi Familia (just down the road, literally), I really hope BOTH restaurants succeed. This Roberto's have a drive thru and is open 24hrs which is always nice when looking for something at any hour.  Service here was good, food was yummy as always! Restaurant was clean inside and out (always a big deal for me, after all-they ARE preparing our food)   The only reason it is 3 stars and not 4 is their phone service: i've called 3 different times now (we've been eating out a lot lately) and one time the phone was answered in Spanish, so I hung up. The next time was ok and the last (3rd) time was 'Hello?'-phone skills are every bit as important as anything else. If you're rude to me (as they were) then i'm going to go somewhere else (as i said, Mi Familia is just down the road). Please, Thank You, You're Welcome: theseshould be standard on every phone call.   Don't act like i'm inconveniencing you when ordering...  Update (down grade from 3 stars): I went to pickup my order (\"Ready in 10 minutes\", then she hung up) 15 minutes later and it wasn't even started. Today my neighbor and I both have food poisoning-stay away from the chicken AND do yourself a favor- go down the road to Mi Familia. Nicer people, family owned, and quality food."}
{"text":"I'm fully reasonable in my expectations for an all night taco shop that has been serving our intoxicated community for many many years, and have always been a big fan, but I believe the real issue at this location is the service.   The overnight cashier seemed irritated by our entrance into the shop, did not offer any friendliness or courtesy to fulfill our requests.   We have been ordering breakfast burritos for years and always combine 2-3 proteins, agreeing to the additional charge, but this cashier would not give us more than one type of protein, and after requesting chips with a side of guacamole, I was heartbroken to open my to go box with the contents shown in my photo."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to have a meal! The taco's are good, the value is great and the staff is nice and friendly. It is nice the way the salsa bar is, the food is authentic and good."}
{"text":"This is a \"hole in the wall\" find that i was throughly pleased with.  I got the three taco plate, and a Horchatas.  The tacos were like taquito's, and the had shredded cheese with guacamole on top.  The Beans and rice had a good flavor.  Over all the food was a 5, however the location of this particular restaurant was a little sketchy, which I only realized as I was leaving.  Regardless, go there for late breakfast through lunch and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's when I am drunk. I hope all of you get to experience awesome tasting cheap mexican food at 4 am after a night of partying cause it's amazing. I recommend anything with \"carne asada\" in front of it!"}
{"text":"They are a hit or miss; & with this order, they struck out. I had a simple order also. I ordered california burrito, with guac, no pico.  Where's the guac?! How do you charge extra for guac and forget to put it in?!  You should realize, when someone orders something extra on their meal, they look out for that extra ingredient. Did you think I wouldn't notice?   I cut this burrito in half, started on one side never to find guac. When I grab the other half to try again on my quest to find the delicious avocado mix, nothing.  Crushed. Im full, with no guac to accompany the others that sit in my stomach.   Good burrito. Just missing what i paid extra for...  This why I have to alternate between Algoberto's and this place."}
{"text":"Chicken Taco Wednesday. What more can I say? OK, I will say more. It's Roberto's, a Las Vegas staple. This location is near my house which is great when I am looking for a Mexican snack attack."}
{"text":"One of the better robertos I've been to! The food was good hot and fresh, casher has great customer service great smile. We dined in and it appears very clean! The carne Asada fries where amazing. I would definitely come back to this location"}
{"text":"Hit or Miss: I like to stop by here at the end of work. I usually prefer the Potato Breakfast Burrito. The Potato appears to be pre-made which has the consistency of a baked potato that they mix with the eggs as it cooks. I like crispy potatoes and request them to be crispy or deep fried. Sometimes they doing it, sometimes they don't. When I complain, I'm treated as if it's my fault.   Don't know if it's a misunderstanding or a complete lack of caring of what the customer requests.  Either way, I avoid the place at times because I don't want to deal with the disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food! I had a beef crunchy taco plate with rice and beans. Everything was delicious, the taco, the rice... so good and the beans nice and cheesy. My husband had the carne asada torta. He said it was very good. This place is clean, delicious and well priced."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! The food is straight garbage. Ordered a Carne Asada burrito and it was not fresh at all: the meat was not warm, like it has been sitting out forever; the only thing hot was the tortilla it was wrapped in (to make you believe the shit is fresh). I ordered here twice during the afternoon and it was okay, but still not fresh. Just save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really love this place because it is clean, the service is fast. Not gret, but fast. I am visiting it time to time just to grab a nacho on my way to work.  The food here is always fresh and you can rely on qulity and quantity. Here need to mention that the prices are fair, some of the dishes are slightly expencive.  My last stay confirmed that the food is grea. If you check in wikipedia there more than 300 traditional mexican dishes. Roberto's is serving about 40 - 50. which is more than enough. The variety is great.  No need to set up reservation before. But in the rush hours you might have to wait for you order 5 - 7 minutes."}
{"text":"Ran to Roberto's for a quick bite at the drive thru.  The girl at the window was friendly and efficient.  I ordered a Shredded Beef Burrito... THIS IS THE BEST SHREDDED BEEF BURRITO I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  ANYWHERE!!!  The beef is render and flavorful and cram packed into lightly toasted soft flour tortilla!   I will drive across town to come to this Roberto's!  Great work!!!"}
{"text":"Beware of this Robertos: no hand washing,  no gloves.  Luckily we caught it and had them remake the food."}
{"text":"Overpriced, tacos with cold tortillas??? Not good at all. The place is completely dirty and the cashier was very rude. Salsa bar ok, no spicy sauces though.  The only good thing about this place is that is open 24 hours, I wish they will have better food and service."}
{"text":"This store was very clean, so that is always a good thing! The carne asada fries are really good, and the portion was huge! This place is open 24x7 and in Vegas that is a good thing. The staff was helpful and got the order just right! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Like all Roberto's - it hits the mark with fast and delicious (and cheap) Mexican food. This one is at a gas station and has no fine-in, but has plenty of outdoor seating! The people who work there are ultra-nice.  Again, the rolled tacos covered with guacamole are the best!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is Roberto's and it is not the world's highest quality food but me and my kids just love the taste of the food.  It is also very heavy and you will feel the food in your stomach for a long time but after my daughter's soccer game - its off to the taco shop for delicious food.  The prices are super-low too and you get a lot of food.  The best thing on the menu are the tacquitos (rolled tacos) covered with guacamole and shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Food is gross! You could get better at chipotle which is right nearby. Always gives me the worst stomach aches.  The reason this place really is only getting one star from me is because one night my friend and I came at around midnight after volunteering at a charity event.  When it came time to pay, she gave them her card and then decided that she actually wanted to pay in cash.  I guess this made her \"drunk\" because they immediately started talking bad about her in spanish, saying how \"we were just there for the food\" (umm why else would you come to Roberto's?!?!?) and that they shouldn't have to serve \"drunk *****s\" (you are working night shift on las vegas blvd, what do you expect, and we were both sober?!) I think someone needs to tell them that white people may know Spanish too, because it was extremley uncomfortable listening to them talk about my friend that way.   We ended up taking food to go, even though we wanted to relax a little before driving home. When I asked for a manager's or corporate's phone number, they refused to give it to me.  Was going to just google it, but decided that yelping would be better :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 Stars that's what I would do! Are you kidding me right now? I just left this dump! I walk in and place a simple order. One of the cooks comes from behind the kitchen grabs the tip jar, dumps out all the filthy dollar bills where the food is prepped and starts to count it in front of me! In the meantime this little old man is standing at the cash register not knowing what the hell to do. He's asking the now infamous \"tip counter\" for help, and this fucking idiot will not only NOT acknowledge the old man that looks completely lost but could care less that I've now been standing at the counter waiting for someone to take my order. So I let them know I'm leaving. Do you think anyone says or does anything to stop me from leaving? Nope! Not at all. The look of embarrassment on the little old man's face was just too much to stomach. Roberto's needs to clean house and rid of that WORTHLESS TIP-COUNTING MOTHERFUCKER behind the counter. There's a time and a place for that estupido. I have news for you compadre, it's not when your customer is trying to place an order and it's not where the food is placed, cochino pendejo. Fucking disgusting!"}
{"text":"You know if you're looking for a quick meal that isn't too bad it will not break the budget we would recommend this place looking for authentic Mexican food this far is from the place you want to be thank God we were only looking for a quick meal.  When we ordered our steak burrito, the steak was dry like it been sitting around for a while really nothing to decide to come back. Of course we are always people that try to give locations a second try, so we decided to come here for breakfast, we ordered breakfast burritos which were very dry tasteless  and nothing special. If we were looking for a couple quick tacos we were deafly give this place a try again."}
{"text":"thank you roberto's thank you for everything the fish burrito was sweet but it was also very authentic, i missed it very much after i finished murdering it. the beans were very delicious my friend got a bean burrito she was very happy to be the one to stab it to death with her teeth i would like to come back sometime you are wonderful please have a great year 2014 feels like it'll be a very good year for all of us."}
{"text":"yum!  I've had the Carne asada tacos and the carne asada burrito.  Plenty of meat."}
{"text":"new location out front of Outlet mall. It is Roberto's not the best not the work just plain \"a ok\"  update  This location  sucks. The smell in this place is horrible, I went in today and ordered a bacon breakfast burrito...it was OK but they charged me $5 for it..I thought it was a special price on Tuesday...I guess not at this location, I am OK paying $5 for a breakfast burrito but this thing wasn't worth $3. plus the smell oh my was it bad."}
{"text":"Miss the 2.99 special but figured I would give them another try since don tortacos breakfast burrito seems to be getting smaller and smaller. May go here now. Still wish there salsa was a little thicker and had more heat less vinegar taste."}
{"text":"Can we ever say enough about Robertos!  No!! Nay!! Love their fresh cucumber slices on the side bar. Perfect offset to the best of the spices! Servings are huge? More than enough to share always. Thanks Robertos!"}
{"text":"One of the best locations in Las Vegas! I cant say the best cause i have not visited them all.. Service is good, as longest you dont have to deal with the girl that works morning shifts :) She is nice, but no English at all. Food is fresh and the cooks are super fast! Best Robertos ever!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this location after seeing a commercial & figured, \"Why not?\" When has t.v ever lied to us before? ;)  This location is straight up a taco stop. Open 24/7 I ordered chorizo (pork sausage) with egg, rice, beans, & tortillas with a delish orange fanta (soda). My people ordered the asada tacos and asada burrito. Four people ate for $20! That's what I'm saying. The portions were good and we didn't feel like we got jipt. The salsa bar offers cebollitas, cucumbers,  jalapenos,  limes, and salsa of course.   The location was clean, the food was all good. Seasoned just right and flavorful. This little spot had a steady stream of customers walking up and drive through. Will come back when we are back in town. The food plus price was perfect.   PLUS THE BATHROOM WAS CLEAN."}
{"text":"Worst tacos I ate tonight, if you go here and get the 99 cent tacos checked them before you leave, cause I got cold and stale tacos fuck this place I will never go back........."}
{"text":"I work right next to this new Robertos. The food is SO good, but the cashier that I encountered wasn't enthusiastic about her job and seemed uninterested in the customers. Great customer service is a must!"}
{"text":"I got jumped inside this Roberto's and the cashier didn't call the cops or do anything to help me. Got out of there as fast as i could (they had run off by the time I woke up from being knocked out and I was afraid they might come back). I filed a police report the next day and the video footage \"conveniently\" cut off before capturing any usable footage of my attackers. Fuck this place. The food is shit and so are the people that work there! 3 guys literally broke my face and the cashier did NOTHING!!! You would think that if there was a bleeding unconscious female on the ground in your restaurant you might want to at least call an ambulance! I have not been back to any Roberto's and I never will. If I hadn't been afraid for my life I would have called the cops right after it happened, and I SHOULD have so I could sue this company into the ground!  Do not go here! It's not safe!"}
{"text":"Never thought I would be writing this for one of my favorite restaurants but after the experience I had this location I will not be back to this location after the unbelievably bad customer service we received. First they mixed up our orders, when I brought it to their attention the cashier told to switch. I explained it to him that my girlfriend is allergic to guacamole, he rolled his eyes mumbled something under his breath & by the time they were done with my order my girlfriend had already finished her meal so I had to put my food in a to go box & leave.  I have never had a problem with any of the other locations except this one & again they will not see my business this location ever again."}
{"text":"This location is nothing like the San Diego Roberto's I am used to.  The rolled tacos are a disgrace to rolled tacos.  The red salsa tastes like battery acid."}
{"text":"One of the better Robertos in town, nice clean location with pleasant staff. Like with all Robertos you have to know what to order so you can get the best deal. I recommend the carne asada burrito for about 5.00 and about 2 steaks worth of meat."}
{"text":"For a small Mexican restaurant it's actually very authentic they cook everything fresh everyday most of the establishments are very clean and well-kept and the people are very friendly and knowledgeable about the food that they're serving there's many locations here in Las Vegas and I do believe they cater or you can have food to go or you can eat in the restaurant either way it's very good food and they range from oh my God just a plain burrito to a little bit of everything and it's all made right there you can watch them cook in this really interesting so stop in when you're hungry and have a bite their prices are good and you'll enjoy it mahalo"}
{"text":"I can only imagine this goodness gets better when drunk, but for my hungover boyfriend and I, it cured all wounds.  We ordered a smorgasbord--more food than either of us should consume on a single day, probably. I with the cheese enchilada plate, and he with the carne asada wet burrito, and the both of us with carne asada street tacos and chips and cheese with guac. The guacamole was probably the least good part of the meal--the dreaded watery avocado paste--but the rest of the meal was delish.  I had never been to any Roberto's--funny living in Vegas for a while and having lived in Southern California as well, but I enjoyed myself. It's interesting how accustomed I get to places like Chipotle and Cafe Rio and then once I get to a place like this, it's at once awesome and disappointing. I want queso! I want chunky avocados! But then I'm like, wait, this is better, actually, and probably with less terrifying ingredients.   Open 24 hours for all those drunken late night cravings!"}
{"text":"Never again will I come here as a piece of wood ended up in my rolled tacos. I'm usually a forgiving person when it comes to stuff like this but one of my front teeth is fake and probably could have busted biting down on A PIECE OF WOOD. No thanks, Robbie. I'll just have to find somewhere else for my late night post-work food needs. Ew."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here for there burritos the only thing is that you can't ask for without onions they said it's already made with it in it confused. But good portions."}
{"text":"You have to of lived here to understand. I grew up on this. Epic and real no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of years. It's always been great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, nice dining room. It's open 24 hours which is awesome. Overall, its in a good location. They just need to  work on speed, it is a bit slow on service."}
{"text":"Rude cashier, I asked if there was red salsa and almost got my head snapped off. Super rude customer service."}
{"text":"Friday 6/8/18, at 4:06 pm, place my order and was told 10 minutes.  Arrived at 4:16, our dinner was not ready, Olivia said it was change of shift, I said no big deal. Then I had her ring up my ticket, after paying I told her it wasn't correct. I didn't order a chicken Chimichang, it was supposed to be a chicken enchilada and one cheese enchilada. Olivia tried to convince me that is how the enchilada rings up.  I told her I knew the difference, then she stated she rung up the wrong thing. I get home to also realize that my order was still incorrect.  I order a side of gaucamole and a side of tort chips, I received and was charged for a side of gaucamole and tort chips with gaucamole.  I called and spoke with Olivia, she stated that is what I ordered. I told her NO, I didn't want guacamole all over my chips. She started to argue with me.  REALLY...BAD BEHAVIOR AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  WON'T BE GOING TO THAT LOCATION AGAIN. Just because I am not Spanish doesn't mean I don't know how to order my dinner."}
{"text":"The closet thing to San Diego Mexican food. Super bomb!  Try out the:  -Chicken tacos -Rolled Tacos -Carne Asada -rice and beans"}
{"text":"Came here for a burrito. What was advertised as being $5.65 came out it $8 when I told them no guac just meat and cheese. I save them avocado money only to be charged over $2 for cheese...makes sense right? They now charge 50 cents to use a credit card even though I spent $15. Also get it to go it's disguising inside."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's... If you're expecting white washed American Mexican food... Don't come here. This place serves the best dirty taco shop crispy shelled tacos on the planet. Their salsa Verde is the stuff of dreams. And their beans... Good God... The way Mexican beans should be, creamy and full of lard."}
{"text":"First of all this is one of the cleanest and organized Robertos in the valley the staff is friendly and remembers locals. I've only been here 5 times(during grave) in the past couple months and the employees remember exactly what I order. Every time I'm here I see the cook rotating food or cleaning his work station the cashier is always happily taking orders or cleaning the place from the top down working hard getting the place ready for the day. My food came out quick and well cooked. I have been to many Robertos and the food has been either chewy or under cooked this place does not compare.   It's a hidden Gem on the right side of Big Lots and Next to PT's if you wanna get your drink on while eating a taco.    Pros  - Quality Control - Cleanliness  - Friendly and Helpful Staff - Simply Amazing  Cons  - None"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to Roberto's, and sadly, I will not go to any Roberto's again after this.  The staff at this location is fantastic, the restaurant is super clean, the service is fast. If I could give them a separate rating for service, I would. Five stars.  But, much like walking in on your parents in their bedroom, what I saw two days ago cannot be unseen.  The carne asada burritos used to be the very best thing on the planet, and craving one, I popped in to order one.  When the woman making my burrito moved, my jaw dropped and stomach sank. No longer is it fresh beef, or even \"we made this earlier and are warming it\" beef.  It's canned, cubed beef out of an......industrial can.  There they sat, stacked two high and two deep--huge cans with large print stating loudly, \"Canned Cube Beef\", and in front of me, my sacred burrito being made with the same.  Sadly, the taste, no matter what they may have done to it, still tasted like higher end canned dog food (it was a dare, and I needed the cash, thank you), and the aftertaste was God-awful.    It brought a tear to my eyes.  I'm sorry it had to end this way, Roberto's.  It's you, not me."}
{"text":":( I used to come here every other week but the prices have raised... The burritos used to be 5/6$ now there 7+ and the quesadilla used to be 2$..l and the  employee wouldn't make me a quesorito for some reason... I'm done coming here. There are a lot of options nearby for the same price"}
{"text":"Fast service. Always a good spot to go for Mexican food. This place even had a take out window connected to the gas station"}
{"text":"I can't even count on both hands how many times the night crew has messed up my order and been rude about fixing it. I should have stopped going here a long time ago."}
{"text":"Usually this place is ok but tonight my boyfriend and I ordered Carne Asada with the fries extra-crispy. We got home and the fries aren't even cooked all the way through"}
{"text":"Great dive Mexican fast food. They have a cult following and I have to tell you that the chicken taco salad is to die for, as is the chicken quesadilla! They cook their chicken in bell peppers, onions and seasonings and that just gives it a special oomph! Prices are GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing on the menu is the shrimp cocktail although my family and I have never ordered anything we did not like. Service isn't the best and food prices are expensive."}
{"text":"Enrique! Where are you lol My husband and I came here again and it was someone we didn't know. He got our order wrong and I was sad lol usually when we come here we don't have any issues then we did.  we still think this place is bomb though so we cool. Lol"}
{"text":"Probably the cleanest Roberto's in town. There's a huge window that allows complete visual of the kitchen. Every time I go the service is awesome. Guy at the front was incredible, and the food was great (by fast food standards, of course). Horchata was awesome, tamales were fresh, and the burrito was a very well put together burrito. c:"}
{"text":"There are times where you want tacos that don't come from Taco Bell or Del Taco, so you find the next best thing -- Roberto's.  There are actually quite a few Roberto's Taco Shop locations throughout Las Vegas, however this one is convenient for me because it's right near UNLV. Everyone knows that the area around UNLV is sketchy, especially at night. So if you go here in the late PM/early AM hours of the day, you're bound to be accosted by the drunk customers or the sketchy people outside asking for money.  The inside of this place is disgusting. It's dirty, repugnant, unappealing -- basically any word that has a similar negative connotation, would describe this Roberto's. The floors weren't maintained and were sticky with black residue from who-knows-what everywhere, the tables weren't clean or wiped down, and the salsa bar (where you can get your condiments and veggies) was dirty and you could tell people were dropping whatever they were getting into the salsas. I don't even think the sneeze guard was clean, either. VOMITROCIOUS.   The food was pretty decent. They have 99¢ tacos on Wednesdays, which we went for and grabbed a few chicken tacos. The tortillas may be a bit hard, but they have a good amount of chicken in there as well as lettuce, parmesan, and cheddar cheese. It's good for the price, I admit. If you don't know what you want to order and want to spare yourself from staring at the menu, then I suggest ordering the carne asada fries. It's pretty good and does the job of filling you up.  If they just step up their game customer service and appearance-wise, then they should be up there with the other Roberto's locations.  If you're brave/near the area and have late night munchies or need to satisfy your Mexican food cravings at weird hours of the day, then you should try this place out (if you can survive the ratchetness, to be honest)."}
{"text":"I found a metal wire in my burrito yesterday at 6:30 pm. I'm currently working on a case against the franchise to seek compensation. This is the first time this has ever happened to me in my life. I would not risk going here. This place might be shutdown. If I find a lawyer who can do so."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Stood at order window for 4 minutes and no would acknowledge me. Everybody Jaber jacking in back. Bad place!!"}
{"text":"I love getting their carne asada fries, and even though I'm a picky eater and I ask for plain carne asada fries with nothing on top (just carne asada and french fries), I still enjoy them!!!! Sometimes, they'll get my order wrong and end up putting something on top, but they understand when I tell them that the order got mixed up. I enjoy coming here a lot and my family does too! My little sister is allergic to a lot of foods, but she loves the beans they make and she can eat them with tostadas."}
{"text":"Dirty as place salsa was spoiled and lemons old . The horchata i bough was bad . The onion on my burrito bas now white nor a normal color. The taquitos tasted old and omg horrible mexican food here i have a video to to show the salad. Bar"}
{"text":"I've been to different Roberto's all over town, and this one is always on top of their   food. Friendly staff, clean building, and great food as always! This place is on top of the way the food is presented and cooked, always very filling and tastes better than the other places in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, noticed they raised  there prices about 30% on every item on the menu...Taped over the old price....Tip jar for fast food?....especially after raising the price like that...Come on Now....I know the difference did not go for employees....Sorry, can't tip after raising the price like that....Too many other Mexican fast food place that are better and fairly priced,,,,Looks like I will be going to the Real Mom &  Pops moving forward....  Sorry, my bad! The Roberto's I was talking about is off of Eastern going towards Anthem...."}
{"text":"Got the california burrito, it was pretty good!   The hot sauces weren't spicy at all, I had to load up on the red and green sauce to get some form of spiciness.  As for the burrito itself, it was worth about two meals -  but then again I don't eat too much in one sitting to get full.  Opens 24 hours a day (Or so I think)."}
{"text":"This is NOT gourmet Mexican food.  This is a good, down-home greasy cheap joint with yummy Mexican cheap eats.  Decor is as basic as it gets, but service is awesome and they aren't skimpy with the cheese!!  Best of all-it's open 24 hours..  Great after a night out, and it won't drain your wallet.  These are all over the place in Las Vegas.  You either love Roberto's or hate it, but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"After waiting for the buffet to open at the fiesta and realizing it's Valentine's Day and that was way too expensive we drove across the street were so excited to see a Southern California Mexican food taco shop in the gas station!!  Friendly service great food for reasonable price when win-win this is Vegas after all"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest. Borderline rude. It's successful because of the food not the employees!"}
{"text":"Can you give zero stars!? Worst rebertos ever and not just from this last visit. I've been here more then a few times and every time there's a problem with my order. Workers have the worst attitudes as well. And if you go through the drive through don't expect to get your drink unless you remind them.   Today I went through the drive through and the order was wrong and no drink, when I told the lady in the drive through she acted so put out that she had to correct it!! This rebertos sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly accurate service!Clean place.food was fresh smiling faces.Well lit up lobby .nice place way better than the KFC that used to b here!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM. i live in socal so i definitely know my way around a delicious, authentic mexican joint but i will tip my hat off to Roberto's. after a drunken night, i ordered 4 carnitas tacos and was shocked when i looked at my meal. HOLY SHIT. these tacos are HUGE ! and STACKED with meat ! with guacamole! i barely finished 2. the only reason i knock off a star is that i think they're meat can be a littleee bit more salty. oh, and their hot sauce kind of sucks. i'm obsessed with king taco style hot sauce and theirs is probably the exact opposite of that. still looking forward to eating here on my next vegas trip"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer Roberto's I've been to. I usually order carne asada fries or the California burrito, but the other day I saw my co-workers eating some taquitos and that made me crave it ever since. So since I was determined I came to this location on a Wednesday night. As I look at the menu I remember they call their taquitos rolled up tacos instead. I order the special that comes with guac and beans as well. I get excited when I get my food and dig in. The rolled up tacos were rather dry? The beans were decent and the chicken taco had a whatever taste. I do like the fact they put cheese all over the servings. I don't think I will order this again and stick to my usual choices of fries or California burrito. Although last time I had the fries I wasn't that impressed either?"}
{"text":"Wow $4.50 for a taco are you kidding me worse roberto tacos ever the service is horrible"}
{"text":"i love this place, their burritos are bomb! and the staff are very friendly too. this is a great place to buy tacos and burritos. and they're open 24/7"}
{"text":"Cactus location sucks because of their employees! Food not that great either... But you go in and the dude at the register looks at you like he wants to fight, I'd slap the shit outta him if I wasn't with my fam,  you try and decide what you want and he acts impatient. I even looked at the employees in the back and they all look pissed off too! Could be b/c it was 100 degrees outside and their AC wasn't on. They shouldn't stay open 24 hrs, this place blows"}
{"text":"I was born and bred in California, with most of my years there spent in America's Finest City -- San Diego.  As such, one could say that I have been exposed to a wide range of taco shops.  One would be correct.  When I moved to Las Vegas in the early 1990s, I was disheartened to find that Sin City did not have any high-quality taco joints.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nada.  Sure, there were a handful scattered about the cityscape that seemingly had nonstop queues out the door, but methinks that was more a function of scarcity of competition than anything else.  Consumers simply didn't have much to choose from.  So over the years I found myself relying on the various Roberto's establishments across the Vegas valley.    A couple of months ago I came across this specific Roberto's (which is now called Don Tortaco Mexican Grill) whilst in search of a quick bite to eat.  This site happens to be located in a small commercial setup that includes car repair places, a check cashing money lender, and a Taco Bell.  While I was tempted for a brief moment to indulge in the bland, gooey concoction otherwise known as the Burrito Supreme at Taco Bell, I decided to give Roberto's a shot...especially since I was in the mood for some carnitas.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I don't know why this Roberto's (now Don Tortaco) is so much better than every other Roberto's I have ever been to...but it is!  So much better!  Better guacamole.  Better pico de gallo.  Better meat.  Better sauces.  All kinds of better!  I would even say it trumps Cotijas in Point Loma!  And that's saying something."}
{"text":"We ordered carne asada burritos and shredded beef tacos and we've got to say that we just loved them! The burritos were simple...meat, guacamole, and pico de gallo....they were huge! The sides are also awesome! We don't understand why the place has 3 1/2 stars....we just moved here from California and this place is just as good as any taco joint in Socal or NorCal!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to do it, went back to Roberto's for another Fish Burrito.  Gotta lov'em.  One of these times I will try something else.  Still have not had a Fish Burrito that beats this one."}
{"text":"I  it! It is so good the best thing I like is the quesadillas! I eat it all of the time! I love how they are so big and I wish I could have them all of the time! thank you for serving them to me!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Roberto's and this is a nice one. I just was served in 3 min and portions were nice. They did a good job in my book!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero review I would. Called in an order to go and still waiting for my food for over 30 minutes. Tipped the guy at the cashier five dollars in advance and still got horrible service. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Good solid hangover mexi food. The chicken, beef hard shell tacos were tasty and their green salsa is delicious. My family LOVES the Menudo so get it while you can on the weekend. Solid place overall."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Roberto's EVER!!! I usually love robertos but I've come here 3x (all during graveyard shifts) and they've found a new way to screw up a bean & cheese burrito every single time! I'll be going out of my way to go elsewhere from now on. I mean c'mon it's like the simplest thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Nasty.  Never coming here again . To start off we get there and the tables were all dirty. I asked for them to clean it and they handed my mom the ragg??!?!? Lol  So my mom ordered an enchilada which was half frozen half hot. I ordered 2 soft tacos,and My tortillas were hard.  The salsas looked extra watered down. And the salsa bar was such a mess!! yuck!!!  Went to the restroom,  and to my surprise there wasn't any seat covers!!   Horrible just horrible.  Atleast the cashier was nice"}
{"text":"I recently moved to this side of town and have stopped at this location a few times after work.. Has to be my favorite location so far!! Especially because the staff is very very friendly!! The food is always hot and fresh, the condiments are always stocked and fresh and the establishment is always clean!! Good job!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times during my 10 years of living on the East side.  This place is always so dirty. Also, it's really annoying that the people taking orders don't speak english! They forgot items in my order this past weekend. I'm done with this crappy location."}
{"text":"We ordered carne asada nachos with everything, carnitas, and a California burrito. The carne asada was wonderfully seasoned, and made the nachos fantastic. The carnitas were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The meat was all great quality and tasty. The California burrito had a lot of flavor and the contents were balanced (sometimes I get a big mouthful of guacamole in California burritos because of a bad balance, but I did not have that problem here).  I'm upset I didn't find this place earlier. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"I eat at different Robertos around the Las Vegas valley and this by far was the WORSE service I have ever had st any of the taco shops in Vegas. I order the same thing every time; carne asada burrito minus the guacamole and add sour cream. They charge an additional $1.50 for the sour cream which shouldn't be a change when you are subbing it for guacamole but ok that's fine. I open my first burrito and no sour cream, I take it back to the counter and ask for sour cream. She ask for my burrito and she returns it to me not folded and no flooded with sour cream. I can't even take a bite with liquid pouring out all over my plate and drenching my hands. I try to fold it back together again and now the burrito is soaking wet. I bring the burrito back to the counter and she offers to make another one which is great. They make it immediately and serve it back to me. I take two bites and realize there is no sour cream on the burrito. Another team member steps in and I figure things will get better now, nope she says I already got enough sour cream on my previous burrito. Really??? I ask for a side of sour cream and she wants to charge me again for another side of sour cream. I try to explain to the new team member that I have already paid for a side of sour cream, she finally decided to just give me half a cup of the completely liquid sour cream. What a joke"}
{"text":"The salsa bar here made me very happy.   The food here made me very happy.   I like carne asada all the ways, except at breakfast time when you have to order the ultimate hangover killer.... machaca burrito with cheese.   Also the coke machine is in the dining are so you can just drown your sorrows in soft drinks."}
{"text":"This is a good choice for a 24 hour meal place, although the service is not too good. I usually come and get the Carne Asada fries with a churro and it comes to around 11.50$. I always say no onions which means no salsa and no guacamole. Last night when I went, they has onions all over my food and since I had placed the order over the phone, I was home when I realized the mistake. When I called back, the lady was like \"oh yes I don't know why he put on onions\" and when I continued to ask for a refund or a new meal she said no?  Since when in the service industry do you not allow refunds or making them new food? That's horrible costumer service if you ask me. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Burritos got smaller, flood still flavorful, but the attitudes of the servers aren't positive and enthusiastic as they use to be. I dont think I'll be eating here again for a while."}
{"text":"Me an a friend came here to eat after work, they charged him a 2 dollar tip of of his debit card. Didn't even ask they just took it out."}
{"text":"Originally from SAN Diego these ta o shops have always been one of the best. You don't realize it until you move to the east coast and their Carne Asada burritos don't come close. The have California burritos filled with rice and beans as fillers. We don't do that. So it's nice to visit my other hometown of Vegas and find a Robertos. The prices have gone up but still a great deal. The breakfast burritos are off the chain as well. Been getting those for years too!"}
{"text":"So I went their with my family last night ordered out food and when it was ready it was not what we had ordered so I told them and their response was no that's what you ordered at this point my 8 year old daughter was sad that she didn't get the tacos they were rude as well so I ordered two tacos for my daughter the whole time we were their the workers looked at us as if we were in the wrong after I spent 35.00 we will never be going back to this place again and telling everyone about what happened here"}
{"text":"Always have to go to Roberto's when we visit Vegas.  It is the one place that is not in LA where I now live.  Love their Chicken hard taco/enchilada plate!  Also great for late night!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's!!!! So why the one star? Because of the employee who brought his unsanitary chubby kid to work! He kept kept licking his fingers and putting his hands in the salsa bar. And no it wasn't a customer he was behind the counter doing this. Well no carrots or salsa for me. I'm so heart broken!!!  This is a brand new Robertos and it's clean for now. Why do you have to bring your kid to work and ruin it for me????? That is a health code violation!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their Carne Asada fries. I have not tried anything else. I ordered a burrito there for my son once and the breakfast burrito was huge my son didn't not even finish half try the burrito it was ham and egg burrito."}
{"text":"So i went to this taco spot today,i usually go to tacos El Tizon on Eastern and Trop and i love their food,i went over to Roberto's today because i was going to walk to Target afterward. I walked in and got no greeting or hello from the person at the counter she acted like she couldn't understand me,i was tempted to order in Spanish to see if she would make more of an effort but decided against it,maybe as another reviewer suggested living in Los Angeles for years means i am used to a higher standard of Mexican food but i doubt it...........I ordered 7 taco's,three for me in the store and 4 for the hubby for later,when i order taco's at a Mexican place i expect soft corn tortilla with fresh Carne Asada,what i got was deep fried shredded beef tacos with lettuce and cheese......i mean i have literly ordered better taco's at Taco Bell.I immediately went to complain to the girl she said that is how they serve them,they have no soft tacos and that i never asked her anything. I spent $15 on these taco's which i think is alot and i was denied a refund so i left with 6 Taco's i will not eat and  was completely irritated.  I think this place is a joke,the picture of their Taco's on the menu board is no reflection of how they serve their food,the meat tasted off and the taco was dripping in grease totally disgusting.I go to Taco's El Tizon and i can get one taco with beans for $1.25 and it comes with a whole choice of salsa sides and pickled veggie's the staff are wonderful and the meat is cooked fresh,the Taco's i bought at Roberto's were $2.09 per taco and i wouldn't be surprised if they came from a box in the freezer. I will never go back and would never recommend the place to anyone........very disappointing"}
{"text":"They're not as good as they use to be. They lowered their meat portions. I ordered carne asada fries and they put more fries and less meat than what they use to put. If they lowered their price along with their portions then I would give them a better rating. Other than that, the food is good and the staff is just fine. If price is a big concern then don't do it."}
{"text":"I love their Carne Asada breakfast burritos.    That being said... Service is poor and wait time especially in the evening time is HORRIBLE!  Crazy thing is:  I'll be back for the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here on the way back home from our grand canyon trip. It got good reviews but we decided for us it was just a 3 star Mexican place. Not half bad, but not overly terrific either!   My burrito was huge and I was so hungry I stuffed it down so fast but than I couldn't finish the nachos we ordered with our meal. It was a decent burrito.   Going to the bathroom scared me a little bit, the bathroom was sketchy and we were there kind of late there wasn't a soul in sight except for us and the employees of the taco place."}

{"text":"Even though it appears to have stayed in the family, we all wish Roberto had procreated a lot less* and thereby our lovely valley marketplace would permit for a better contender when it comes to overpriced, shitty California-Mexican food.   (*Keep it in his pantalones.)   This specific Robertos takes the cake for shittiness. Dirty space, indifferent service (whether one orders in English or Spanish, scoffs; what is the point of knowing Spanish then?), and even featuring the shittiest agua fresca I have ever tasted in my entire fucking, miserable life.**   (**It is like they went to the neighbourhood WalMart, purchased the horchata they sell there, and then felt they should thin it out, so these cheap bastards watered that already-watery shit. Goddammit.)   Why am I paying 9$ for a Carnitas or Asada plate with nasty rice, nastier habichuelas,*** and barely human-grade meat? I would find this grade of meat inferior to even feed my cat. How is this location still in business?   (***We call them that; bugger off.)   Avoids the one-star by managing to not kill me via foodborne illness. Congratulations Robertos Taco Shop on Rainbow near Charleston! And who does Taco Wednesdays anyway? (Inutil pedazo de mierda más ....)"}
{"text":"Got our order wrong, forgot items, I paid for additional items and wasn't given them. I went up to the cashier not once but twice to get it corrected. They need to get their act together. You guys do NOT know good customer service nor proper food etiquette. I WISH I could give you guys 0 stars. I wish I read reviews before I came to this location. Never again...."}
{"text":"My first experience with Roberto's! While it isn't the type of place I would want to eat at often, it is definitely the kind of food I constantly crave while looking for an unhealthy caloric escape from homework! So many menu items I need to try.... On another note, clean location and right off of Cactus in the Southwest/Southern Highlands neighborhood"}
{"text":"Normally we are always so pleased with the quality of food from Robertos...its usually our cheat day however today I was soooo disappointed! I ordered a fish taco, however when I opened my to-go order what I found was an overly fried piece of fish with sauce and pico on top however it was missing the tortilla. How can something be called a \"taco\" without a tortilla?  I ate it with a fork but one half of it was so hard it was inedible! Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. Food is always made to order. Customer service is usually fast and friendly. The breakfast burritos are huge for six dollars. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever!! Please don't eat here. The tortillas were stale and the SERVICE was HORRIBLE!! The cashier was a female with an attitude and was so annoyed with everything!! The restaurant looked dirty and the tables were not clean. I ordered a Churro at the end and they gave me a cinnamon filled one instead of a regular one!! I took it back and the cashier almost bit my head off!!  I will NEVER come back here!!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food Mexican food places that I've been to. What I love about it is the fact they have a drive thru that is open 24/7. My favorite here is the Carne Asada fries. Now I've tried other places in California and in Henderson and none of them come close to how flavorful, as well as how packed of a container you will get for the money. Best bang for your buck. Will always come here to get my carne asada fix."}
{"text":"No more lengua. poor customer service, (where they make tons of mistakes on your order) and they raise prices. And they got rid of the carne asada deal. Ridiculous it's almost like they can't afford the remodel and they are making the customers pay for it. Lol the Roberto's down the street is our new Roberto's.  Asked for guacamole and pico. This is has barley any guacamole. Wtf"}
{"text":"By far our absolute favorite place for tacos on the planet,  especially when visiting Las Vegas.  This is real shredded beef and a nice crunchy shell.  I can't stop eating this stuff.  They are usually always open so they are available anytime you need a dam taco.  They also serve breakfast and you bet it is delicious as well.  I really wish they would open one here by me, once you eat their tacos, nothing compares."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's review since it's his favorite place.  I just love the carne asade burritos, that's what you come here for. I mean the enchillads are ok and the tacos are nice but it's all about coming here after work and grabbing a big burrito. Plus i used to come here after going to clubs and what not since it's open 24/7"}
{"text":"Best hang over cure. Good Sprite. (For those people like me, it's very important) and great for just before that long drive home."}
{"text":"I think this location is pretty damn good. My orders are usually pretty difficult, and now that I'm pregnant, they're even worse, and the employees at this location always work with me to help me get exactly what I want. It's rare that they get my order wrong, and they have never got my husband's order wrong. The only problem I've noticed is that because this location is often very busy, sometimes the employees can be a bit snappy, but not too bad, and the cleaning of the front can get behind when they are busy."}
{"text":"Been to quite a few roberto's around the town and this one is by far my favorite. Clean, friendly, and the food is exactly how I like it. Some roberto's skimp on the good stuff but not this one. The chef at the time made a burrito exactly how a burrito should look like. They deserved all five stars."}
{"text":"99 cents chicken tacos on Wednesdays.  Love their enchiladas, sometimes I have them add shrimp to it.  I can compare them to Albertos in Cali.  Good food, especially late at night...they are open 24/7.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Eat here every Wednesday & some days in between & this drive thru location is the best around!! Nicest employees & decent portion sizes everyday!! If you haven't tried this location...do try it soon!! Love my Roberto's!!!"}
{"text":"Always the freshest & tastiest 'fast food' for Mexican food! Got 4 99 cent chicken tacos- 2 bean & cheese burritos & a bit more... Everything tastes great! Everything is in the bag-they never forget! This location is the BEST one in town!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and greasy food that's perfect for your hungover drive back to LA!!! The service could definitely improve as the cashier looked like she wanted to spit in your face but the food was much needed and worth the drive from the strip. It's also not too far from the airport so it was good since we were dropping a friend off. There was no wait and food came out relatively fast. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not actually mexican, so I may have a bit of a bias for the more american vein of mexican food.  I waited for the perfect time and for when I was in the perfect condition to try this place- slightly drunk, and 12:45 AM. Upon walking into this fine establishment, I noticed it smelled like urine- like, as if I had walked into a public rest room. Because of this, I did not stay long here  I ordered a carne asada burrito that I enjoyed in the car on the way back home. And it was a-ok! The meat was good, loved the veggies and guac.... the highlight was definitely the tortilla. It tasted fresh. I do love me a fresh tortilla. It cost around 5 dollars, which is a great deal.  If you're up late and want some late night munchies, I definitely sugest roberto's. If you enjoy eating at establishments that don't reek of piss, then I would maybe hit up somewhere a little more expensive, where they probably pay their employees to clean."}
{"text":"I eat Roberto's a lot and this location had the best chicken tacos I've had from a Roberto's! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is Roberto's there are many like this but this is mine!!! I have been to so many Roberto's and yea their menu are the same but this is by far the best!! They make you feel welcomed but just order eat and leave but I get a lush from the humor and hospitality!! I like that they tweak the order if I ask like half chicken half carneasada chimichanga!! Don't like how small inside but I'm guessing it's one of the old ones. Only downfall is the bad area of the city it's in connected to a PT's. Wouldn't recommend late night visit!! But if the suns out see if it's better than your local Roberto's!!!"}
{"text":"What's up with the ridiculous price raises? Foods that were $6.50 are all of a sudden $8.00. Almost everything on the menu has been raised by more than a dollar. You're almost better off going to a sit down mexican restaurant at these prices. At least the food is of quality there!"}
{"text":"The first time we ordered the chicken tacos they were fantastic. I thought, GREAT, I've found a good taco place. The second and third times, the tacos were cold and sitting in oil. I am not sure how they prepare their tacos, but it seems they cook a bunch, then \"reheat\" them in cold oil. This place is not consistent."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2003.. It has gone downhill.. I always get bean and cheese burritos and when we came tonight, there was literally SAND in my burrito..as if the beans aren't pre-washed before cooking. I could not finish it so more than half of it went into the trash..  Too bad. The red salsa didn't taste great either. Used to be much better.."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Roberto I'm provided with the best customer service by their employers thank you!"}
{"text":"This location is the least favorite. My carne asada fries was made like slop...my cheese was on top of the sour cream and guacamole REALLY? My fries are cold and half cooked."}
{"text":"I always get the no 4 two beef tacos rice and beans.  On a suggestion from a friend I tried the carne asada burrito. WOW this thing is fantastic. For the first time I was asking for more of the other ingredients other then beef crazy I know. But this thing is awesome.   Have tried beef tostada, bean tostada, chicken rolled tacos, beef rolled tacos, beef nachos, chicken tacos, cheese enchiladas everything is really good.    Life hack the nachos are so big they get soggy."}
{"text":"Charge me 20.00 for steak fries and a taco with extra guacamole, something doesn't add up!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some late night food. Their fryer wasn't working according to the cashier and that was understandable. We ordered carne asada burritos and a carne asada torta instead of the carne asada fries we really wanted. We got our food to go. Upon  picking up our food we see the cook frying up some fries for another customers order. It was a miracle!  We go to our hotel room to find that our carne asada burritos had meat and a very onion filled pico de gallo only. The torta was missing beans.  The plus was the meat was good.  Good luck with your experience."}
{"text":"This is not about the food but about the girl taking our order.  We were her on vacation and staying at the Cancun Resort. My son lives in North Vegas so I am a little familiar with Roberto's. I love the fresh cucumbers at the salsa bar!  We brought our three grandkids who all wanted tacos. I sent my husband in to order and the girl at the front just seemed annoyed with his ordering. He was trying to find the most cost effective way to feed our group of 5. He ended up ordering 3 combo plates for $22.38 for all 5 of us to share. All the tacos on the orders were different to satisfy the 3 kids preferences so she became extra annoyed at the special order for each combo.   It was Wednesday and the place was very busy...why? Because it was .99cts taco day at Roberto's! This awful woman let my husband struggle with this order! We had 6 tacos to share for 5 people with beans and rice and it cost, again $22.38!!! We could have all had 2 tacos each for $12.00 and a much easier way for us to order to her!  We saw the sign in the window long after we ordered. What I can't understand for the life of me why this woman didn't tell my husband it was .99 cent taco Wednesday. I think it was a terrible thing to do to a family.   I hope Roberto's will tell their staff that the decent thing to do is tell folks of the daily specials. Especially considering how many folks are from out of town in Vegas and don't know the specials offered."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean cashier super sweet but the food!!!!! I never go Thru drive thru any more since the order always ends wrong, I may have to change locations too.  You would think every location would taste the same or at least be consistent.  The same dish I always get was do horrid I was stunned and couldn't even finish it.  My sons food was just as bad if not worse.  The Chili Colorado was so nasty it tasted like nothing but spicy hot Tomato paste.  My sons chicken burrito which we never get hot was so bad after 4 bites he spat it out and then ate a pop tart for dinner!  They get 1 star for the cashier and 1 star for everything being clean but that's it the young man cooking needs to be retrained or the removed from cooking"}
{"text":"Order was wrong. Over charged. And my nachos were soggy with lots of liquid. I love this chaina md have never had a problem at any location and it was my 1st time at this one. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, but mess up your order all the time. I've ordered carnitas and gotten carne asada; ordered no Pico and gotten extra... tonight I ordered beef tacos and got chicken. Check all your food before leaving."}
{"text":"Very Good!  Big Servings!  Low Price!  I don't even like Mexican food but I have to give this place 5 stars.  Love the spicy carrots on the fixins bar."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to Robertos and there are definitely some not-so-great ones around town.  This one is exceptional, from their guacamole to their salsa bar.  On point!  And one of the few left that don't charge that annoying 50¢ credit card fee."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Roberto's I've been to. Had egg shells in my breakfast burrito-and not just a little shell. It was half an egg shell. This is ridiculous. Will not go back.  Shared photo to this store as well."}
{"text":"Uhh...This place is JUST ok if that. I went there last night (well about 1 AM) and ordered the chicken chimichanga. The chicken was way too salty I couldn't even finish it..I ended up eating some of the tortilla and throwing the rest away. The beans and rice were both bland."}
{"text":"The beauty of Roberto's is that if you are driving home from the strip at 3am, it is virtually impossible NOT to find one at that hour. They are everywhere: old Taco Bells, strip malls, gas stations, etc. In every direction of the compass. There must be like twenty five in Vegas.   Roberto's is like a Bail Bondsman-- he keeps you out of jail for DUI!"}
{"text":"This is a great little Mexican fast-food chain.   You can find Roberto's sprinkled all over Las Vegas.   It's a cheap alternative to sitting down at a Mexican restaurant.   The best part about this location?  They have Machaca!    Machaca is made in the Mexican state of Sonora, where they dry the shredded beef with chilies and garlic. It's cooked with eggs and it makes a perfect Brunch burrito. I also ordered some enchiladas but the cheese wasn't melted and they use an orange type of cheddar cheese not Monterey.  No drive-thru here.   I think for the value and the other items I've tried that were very good, including the tacos and rice and beans, I would come back.  Menudo on Sat. and Sun.  Thank God for Mexican Food.   Viva Mexico!"}
{"text":"Good ol' reliable.  Open 24 hours in the south west corner of Charleston and Buffalo with the gas station right next door.  I usually work really late into the odd hours of the night and what makes this location even more convenient is their drive thru!    The prices are affordable, the location if very clean, and this is one of the few 24 hour food stops within this area.    I'll take my steak, chicken, or carnitas the way it is: perfectly well made with friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of Roberto's around town for some down-home, greasy somewhat authentic Mexican food.  This particular location is OK, but it is in a seedy little strip mall.  For those of you not in the know, it's in the same mall as the Big Lots.  It is hard to find, it's around one of the far corners of the mall, tucked in between a laundry cleaners and a PT's Pub.  Can be easy to miss.  Came here late one night after a Yelp event because we were hungry and had the urge for some tacos for some reason.  This Roberto's is probably the closest one to our place since they closed the one that used to be on N. Rainbow Blvd.    The inside of this Roberto's is typical, same paint scheme (white), same menu, even the same layout as other Roberto's around town.  So it's nice and familiar.  Stayed with what we know should be good:  -3 Rolled tacos with shredded cheese and guacamole -Carne asada burrito  Placed the order and proceeded to wait for our nibbles.  This is where the night almost takes a frightenly sickening turn.  Each Roberto's has their 'salsa bar', right?  So my wife sees this guy that placed his order before us...wait.  If you are the queasy type that gets sick easily you should skip reading the next paragraph and proceed on down.  SO...my wife sees this guy that placed his order before us at the salsa bar.  He's making a few containers of red and green salsa to go.  He's also filling up little plastic bags with radishes, and pickled carrots with jalapenos.  Here's where it gets kinda gross.  This guy, he arranges the pickled carrots with jalapenos in his plastic bag, tears the stem off of one of the jalapenos, licks his FINGERS (yes, licks), then proceeds to throw the jalpeno stem back into the tray of pickled carrots and jalapenos on the salsa bar!  FRIGGIN' GROSS!  Seriously, and this guy thinks no one was watching him during this heinous act.  Luckily my wife was kind enough not to go into full panic mode right away.  She waited till this doofus left with his food to let me know.  I immediately picked up the entire tray of pickled carrots and jalapenos and brought it straight up to the counter to tell Roberto's staff what happened.  Hello...anybody remember the 'Firefly' fiasco??  Anyway, the staff we apologetic and went straight to throwing away that tray and making an entire new batch of pickled carrots and jalapenos in a new tray.  Salmonella averted!  Geez guy, next time eat at home and play with your own carrot.  Or jalapeno.  You would think after what happened we would make a beeline to the door.  But no, we were too hungry so we waited.  Just didn't bother touching much of the salsa bar.  Glad we waited too.  Our fatty Mexican food was pretty much on point.  The rolled tacos were hot and crunchy, covered in a layer of bright orange cheddar cheese and a load of guacamole.  My carne asada burrito was nice and hot, with good cuts of steak, seasoned well and mixed with cheese.  No filler on this one.  Grease rules the coop here!  I do enjoy most of the menu at Roberto's, from the chicken tacos, to the tortas.  Of course, they also serve lengua and cabeza!  That's Mexican speak for tongue and head, yo!  Oh God, I really (really) want to insert a tongue-head joke so bad right now...but I'm gonna resist.  Eat at Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Just over $10 and I got a beef taco, 3 rolled tacos-loaded, a quesadilla, and a bottle of water. Bonus points for the grease-laden quesadilla. This was a fantastic gut bomb that would have been perfect as a hangover cure. They never disappoint, unless you are my buddy..... They seemed to have forgotten his order entirely. That's ok-didn't hurt my rating one bit."}
{"text":"I have been to two separate Roberto's in the Henderson area and I am now 0 for 2.  I got sick both times after I had been to this chain.  The first I had a beef burrito and this time chicken enchiladas.  Disgusting and sickening."}
{"text":"The food is garbage... Iono who the cook that works graveyard is, but he sucks.  No pride in his work.  He and the tons-o'-fun lazy moo-cow that works the counter make me want to throw chairs.   There's this one little cashier dude though, you'd know who I'm talking about, cause he's the only one that smiles... that guy is cool. Tip him every time."}
{"text":"This is the best Robertos I have found in the Las Vegas area.  The business is clean and I have always received great service."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update my review for months now. This Roberto's is on the way home from work w/ a drive-through, so it makes for a very convenient take-away on those really long days! The food has gotten much better the last few months! The husband always chooses the chicken chimichanga, I typically choose rolled tacos & sometimes a few other additions... The rolled tacos are consistently good. The chips & cheese are also tasty. The beans at this location are typically good- the rice is \"fine\".   I give it 4 stars because the food is good, fast, & convenient!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place, I really did it's near my house and wanted a place a little closer to pick up good burritos and nachos, I ordered the carnitas burrito with bean and rice and sour cream, I had to pay extra for all, first off carnitas meat should be stringy looking kind of pull apart style but this particular meat was in chunks and burnt on one side, so I truly don't know how old this meat is and it had no flavor, carnitas has its own natural flavor, how is it flavorless? The rice was bland as well so the entire burrito has no flavor. The nachos were full of meat but the very little cheese they placed had not been melted so it was minimal cold cheese. Yikes I've eating good quality Mexican food and low budget Mexican food and it fell way short of that sadly. If you really are craving Mexican Tacos take the Trip to Tacos el Gordo. Those lack nothing at all, if you want simple Mexican or Nachos and I mean real nachos go to Tacos la Mexican on Durango and Mt spring road, other then that I truly don't recommend this place the soda machine was good and their side set ups was nice but truly this is not Mexican food Mexican food has flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way home from work the other day, got 2 burritos and was charged 103$.  They told me to wait 5 minutes for someone to come in and figure out how to reverse it, but while I waited I would get my food.   15 minutes passed and no one came and they didn't start making my food.   I've never felt so disrespected at a business in my life, when I asked them after patiently waiting fifteen minutes they talked to each other in Spanish and then said hold on and ignored me.   Been here many times, this being the last"}
{"text":"Use to go here a lot, but recently I've stopped due to the asada tasting bad. They use to cook the meat fresh on the grill when you ordered it. Now they keep it cold in a pot. Disappointed to know one of my childhood food spots are going down the drain."}
{"text":"Everytime i go here and get carne asada fries they screw me and give me like no steak or sourcream the best one is on green valley and horizon ridge i will never go to this robertos again. Even if this is convenient dont go here its a waste of your time go a little farther."}
{"text":"All stuff are nice. But only casher can speak English  I always get shrimp Cocktail. Big size only $10. !! Great !! And open 24h !! They charged $1.50 if you ask for more veg ..."}
{"text":"To me this is the five star Robertos in Vegas experience, that I've come to know.  Drop a cash tip and see how quickly your service improves.  This is still Vegas and cash tips are greatly appreciated by nearly all...  Bacon breakfast was on point and because I was nice to the guy and starting talking about the Raiders coming to vegas due to his hat and BAM my burrito was served up mas grande.  I could taste the fresh ground cheese which is great and the pico de gallo upgrade is essential.  Early in the morning the floors are mopped and the salsa bar is all clean and fresh including utensils, all very nice aspects."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since 2001, since I'm new to yelp let's funky with it.  Robertos is disgustingly delicious! You see the 5 pound carne asada fries before your eyes and you just feel happy. You take that first bite. You let it sit in your mouth, it's so goooooood, you feel like you're getting hit by a truck! That's how flavorful it really is! Indeed pleasurable :)"}
{"text":"Okay so this place just opened about 3 weeks ago. The first time I came here (2days after they opened) the food was great, fresh made to order and delicious. How ever a week later I came back a couple times and I saw them doing a method where they have carne asada already cooked and being kept warm in a metal jar over the grill with tongs in it. I guess they do this so that they don't have to keep cooking a fresh batch of meat every time they get an order but it's horrible. And it doesn't make any sense because carne asada only takes 3 minutes to cook. I got my food and the meat was barely warm and tasted stale and hard. This is coming from someone who ate Roberto's growing up in Vegas. Lazy method by lazy employees. I asked them to re make my order and make me fresh meat and they did. Just upset they had to turn to bad habits so quickly."}
{"text":"Roberto's Breakfast Burritos are the best, in my opinion! Not only are they tasty and delicious but they are very affordable and you get a big filling. This particular location is just off the highway tucked away in a plaza area. The staff and cooks are very nice and fast with your food that they cook in front of you, if you desire to watch them make your food."}
{"text":"One thing that's important to remember is that when you're rating a Roberto's, its best if you review it compared to other Roberto's.   We all know what's up here. They're a taco shop. Their tacos are greasy, crunchy, and awesome. Their burritos huge and burritoey. Their food superb for that late snack when you're regretting all the booze you drank a couple hours ago. A great place for a work lunch when you just want something greasy and cheesy that isn't a burger, especially on $1.29 chicken taco Wednesdays. There are few greater comfort foods in the world.  Now, this location.   It's easily one of my favorites, and I'm a frequent patron due to its proximity to work.  Pros of this one versus other Roberto's.  1. The staff is awesome. They're always busting butt to get the food done ASAP, and always polite when ordering. The main checker there during the day is always friendly with me and does some small talk while we ring up the order. Love it.  2. Their red sauce is fire, to an almost literal extent. Other locations have very timid, almost tomatoey red sauce. Not this place. Their red sauce takes no prisoners and will make you it's bitch if you have too much. Keep in mind that I eat super hot stuff all the time, so I'm no stranger to the wonders of capscacin.  3. The place is well maintained and they keep good tabs on the sauce/lime/carrot & jalapeno cart.  4. Those $1.29 chicken tacos. Yes, other places have them, but there's something about how they make them here that just makes them extra crunchy and greasy. Outstanding.  Cons:  1. No green onions on the condiment cart. Sad face.  2. It can get pretty stupid busy, especially on Wednesday, so plan accordingly. Not really their fault, but FYI.  3. Parking is atrocious there. That whole shopping center is a parking nightmare. Again, not their fault, but FYI."}
{"text":"I used to love Roberto's (aka Maria's) because I could walk there and they had decent, consistent Mexican food at a good price. However, the last couple times I've been there, the food has not been decent at all. My husband got a carne asada burrito and pulled out a chunk of fat probably one inch by one inch by one inch. No exaggeration, there was zero meat on this chunk. Sick. After that, we decided to give Roberto/Maria one more try since we had had so many good times in the past. Once again, the meat was gristly and neither of us finished our meals. Instead, I'll be going across the street to 100% Natural for my takeout Mexican food from now on. It's a little more expensive, but at least I can actually eat it!"}
{"text":"My normal Roberto's is down on Rainbow and Flamingo which I absolutely love them but this store is also wonderful they always get everything right no matter how weird I changed my order. My regular Roberto's tends to overcook or even burn meat (i know it's word but i like it that way!) as to where this place doesn't, it gets it right. This restaurant is a bit larger more seating and always great service and clean."}
{"text":"I have never had a problem with an order here though they do tend to kind of over cook or burn their meat but for me that's not a problem because I've always kind of preferred it that way. It's a small place not a lot of seating but the service is great they always get everything right and it doesn't matter how much I mess with my order and change it every which way they always get it right! I am a regular here and I will remain a regular!"}
{"text":"A surprisingly good local chain. Food was prepared well and pretty authentic despite being a chain taqueria. Meats were tasty and the price was very wallet friendly. I'm a fan of the tacos, both soft and crispy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's location in all of Las Vegas.  I've tried many.  Breakfast burritos are the best because their cooks know how to cook eggs.  Some locations overstir the scrambled eggs.  The salsa bar is always clean, which is not always the case at many of the Robertos locations.  It's hard to put a finger on it, but this location seems to have the best tasting food.  The burritos are full.  There is enough cheese.  Also handy is the fact that they have a drive thru.  My only criticism is the dining room is in need of a remodel.  Other than that the place is top notch."}
{"text":"(Positive) Big portions for the price and the quality is good too + I like their salsas.   (Negative) They don't offer water cups nor do they have even water at the fountain. :-/ I was a little disappointed about this because I don't drink soda and I didn't want to pay so much for bottled water."}
{"text":"How many 24 hour mexican fast food places does one town need? Apparently Vegas did not have enough, because a brand spanking new Roberto's recently opened up pretty close to my work.  There is another Roberto's even closer to my work that has been open for quite some time... But my coworkers and I have all agreed, this location on Rainbow is worth driving an extra block.   It is clean and spacious. The price is right. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"For cheap, fast, tasty Mexican food I haven't found a place in Las Vegas better then Roberto's. This location is very close to my work, so it is the one I go to most often. They are open 24 hours and have a drive through.  I only get two things from here: the potato, egg & cheese breakfast burrito (which is more more of a brunch burrito then a breakfast burrito) with pico de gallo added. Or the tasty carne asada California burrito. HUGE portions for $5.   Fun fact: Did you know that pico de gallo translates to rooster's beak? I don't get it either..."}
{"text":"Surprising good food for the price. Very good service . Employees seem to really care that your happy. Store is always clean even at the busiest of times. Will frequent this place a lot!"}
{"text":"Every once in awhile I'd see this place and think...looks like some of the taco shops I go to in Southern California.  But I would never try it. Coming from San Diego (15 minutes from TJ), I became a snob when it came to taco shops out here.  I had this attitude that no taco shop in Vegas can come close.   After reading some of these reviews, I thought I give this place a try.  I was starving and been to plenty taco shops that can mess up a carne asada burrito and carne asada chips.  You know how it goes??  You're hungry, but at the same time in no mood to experiment.  So, I naturally played it safe and went with the rolled tacos.  I'm not going to say it was the best rolled tacos that I've ever had, but it was good enough for me to come back.   I didn't give this place 3 stars or 5 stars because I didn't really try anything special.    I still need to try their -Carne Asada Fries -Carne Asada Chips -Carne Asada Burrito  If this place can deliver on any one of these, I will change my rate to a 5.  One wish regarding the rolled tacos...I wish they had the mixed white cheese with the red tips.  If you're from California, you know what I'm talking about.   Overall, this places has me curious on how good it really is.  I will be back to find out.  This place reminds me a lot of the taco shops in San Diego, compares to Alberto's and Sombrero's.  One positive for sure is the service, cleanliness, and it's open 24hrs."}
{"text":"I love Robertos! Get off the plane and this location is closest to the rental car pick up. Any time of day go get you some Mexican food. Chicken tacos are my favorite - juicy shredded chicken with fresh lettuce and cheese inside a deep fried taco shell. I could eat these for life!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and I'm from Texas can't find much out here that relays to the food there but they seem to capture it here I had one small problem with a carne asada burrito I ordered was something completely different but besides that the food is absolutely amazing and it seems to be very clean I have been visiting ever since I went there and will continue I appreciate my neighbor is putting me on to Roberto's Taco Shop"}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego so I'm very familiar with Roberto's. The ones in Vegas aren't as good as the SD shops but they are still pretty solid. Not the best, certainly not bad though."}
{"text":"Wasn't going to say anything until girl swept dirt on me.  Girl sweeping rug towards me and I can feel dirt hitting my legs, wow!  Wtf?  Seriously!  Get a vacuum.  Whole restaurant was dirty and disgusting.  Sink in men's room faucet handle broken.  Restroom also dirty and disgusting. Then over charge me for my burrito, asked for no cheese but she charges me for it anyway.  I'll never come back to this one."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food is amazing!! I love the chicken tacos and my bf loves the cheese enchiladas and bean and cheese burritos. Their service is always fast and the food is fresh.   My only complaint for this location is, that when we went, mind you it was lunch hour...this place was packed, the empty tables were dirty, one person taking orders and the line was long. I'm sure if I went at any other time, it would be great.   This location is super close to me and very convenient for us to drop in and get a meal quickly."}
{"text":"I give this Roberto's a 3 star. I love the food, but the service has been lacking and most of the times I have gone to this locations, they do not have the salsa bar stocked and/or the drinks are out.   This location is just across the street from where I live on Eastern and is also in the same parking lot as Jamba Juice, Panda Express, and 24 Hour Fitness. I come to this location more often now then before because of the location and it's very convenient for me to just walk a few minutes and get some food fast.   I always order the chicken tacos (in my opinion, some of the best chicken tacos I've ever had!), and have at times ordered the Carna Asada Burrito or the Carna Asada fries. Both are also very good. Food always comes out quickly. Never have waited more then 5-8 minutes for an order, which is always a big plus++.  Cons for this location: 1. They could make sure the salsa bar is always stocked, especially during rush hours. 2. Drink/Ice machine needs to be always filled as well. 3. The times that I've gone, there are always dirty tables. 4. They also need to run a/c or at least a fan in their shop. It's always so stuffy and hot whenever I go there.  Other then that, it's a great place to get food fast."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and this location didn't disappoint at all!  I stopped in here on my way back to Phoenix as I was craving their amazing chicken tacos. It was early in the morning, so no one else was there when I got there so was able to order right away.  First thing I noticed was how clean and organized this location was. It also looked like a newer place than the ones I'm used to going to. Tables were all cleaned, the floor was swept, trash was taken out, trays picked up and the salsa bar was filled and clean.   The menu was very easy to read and very straightforward. I'd say the thing I was disappointed in was the prices. It seems as the prices on their food items have gone up quite a bit since I lived here a few years ago.   I got the chicken tacos and they were still as good as I remember them. The chicken was well seasoned, moist, and they gave you just the right amount of it in each of their tacos. The taco shell is fried, so it was nice and crispy without being greasy. They top their chicken tacos with two kinds of cheese and lettuce. I wish they gave you the option of tomatoes and onions as well, but they were still awesome!  The service was quick and efficient. The two people working were very pleasant and easy to talk to. I did have to really work on trying to understand the guy that took my order as he had a very strong accent. Good thing the register shows your order before you pay.   Look forward to coming back to this location again soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good food, clean, nice staff, cheap prices. The mini condiment bar makes it go the distance to 5 stars. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and was happy when I came across this location as it is very close to where I live and will be able to stop in when I have cravings for their amazing chicken tacos.  I came around 6:30 pm and the place was empty. The lady at the register was very friendly and gave me a few minutes to look over the menu, even though I knew what I wanted to get. I got a couple of their chicken tacos to go.   As I waited for my food, I took the time to look around the inside of the restaurant. The main dining area is large with plenty of tables for those that want to dine in. It was kept clean and organized. The floors were swept and looked like they had just been mopped as well. Trash can was emptied. The salsa counter area was clean and sauces, cucumbers, carrots and other items were all filled.   They had music playing softly which was nice. Some locations the music is pretty loud and I can't hear myself think.   My food came out fairly quickly and even though it was about 10 minutes before I was able to eat them, they were still delicious!! Chicken was well seasoned and moist. The shell was nice and crispy without being too greasy. I think this location adds a lot.morw cheese then the other locations I've been too. So, if you like lots of cheese, this is the location to come to.   Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Personal preference, but I truly enjoy Roberto's and the food that I've gotten from them. This place is one of the cleanest with such friendly employees working there.   I have so far only come during Taco Wednesday as I LOVE their chicken tacos and they are only $1.29 each. They fry up the shell so it's nice and crispy and fill it with moist chicken and topped with lettuce and two kinds of cheese. And they don't skimp on the ingredients. Each time I've gotten their tacos, they are overflowing!  The two employees that have been there the times I've come have been super friendly, have smiles on their face and are patient while you look over the menu and always make suggestions if you can't find what you want. Also, they are always willing to make something just how you want. Example, a friend wanted a bean and cheese burrito combo, but they didn't have it, so they were willing to making the meat, bean and cheese burrito without the meat, but they still charge the same even without the meat.   The inside of the restaurant has been super clean. Tables all wiped down, chairs in their proper places, bathrooms clean and stocked up with the necessities, salsa bar clean and filled up.  Sad they don't offer any pico de gallo, but I get the red sauce that they have. Sometimes it is pretty spicy, but this last time it wasn't..so not sure if they use the same recipe each time. I always leave with a bagful of cucumbers as well. Yumm :)  Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Service was amazing-- that's were it ended.  See my tip about the food. When I got home,  I painted the toilet for over an hour!  Nuff said, right?"}
{"text":"Laura was so friendly .  My 1st time at this location.  The food was so so.  It was 445am and then chicken tacos were. It warm.    Oh welll."}
{"text":"They get an extra star for being open 24 hours.  But the food was not good and the cook barely spoke English. It was four in the morning and maybe it's hard to find good help at four in the morning     Place was clean but very mediocre food"}
{"text":"This place has great late night food come here on Tuesday nights late which is officially Wednesday and you get $.99 chicken tacos that are off the hook I have no idea where this place is a 2 1/2 star rating because it's good when you get a great taco for $.99 don't believe all these reviews I've been here 20 times and it's always pretty damn good"}
{"text":"Robertos Closest location to my house! Nothing much to say but here's what i've got.  Since this location is literally a block and a half away from home i can literally walk to have a late night snack. Price is very good for the portion of food you get. I usually get the carne asada breakfast burrito. Packed with meat and very thick. I'm full and content once im done with it.  Service here is always friendly and fast. Nothing much to say other than that when it comes to service. Most of the time the tables are clean and the floor is clean, every once in awhile i walk in and there's a small mess on a table from customers not cleaning up after themselves or on the counter top of the soda machine there's a mess, but what fast food restaurant doesnt?  I come here for my mexican food fix, great deal for the money you spend."}
{"text":"Wake up guys i love Roberto\"s taco since 10 yrs ago This place bad bad bad i went to around 2 am to eat taco salad    Insinde of togo bow darkn oil was filled up for hanf inch with taco salad   How dirty is this??? Do you guys want me to eat dark deepfried oil with salad together?  This is my first time feel really bad to you guys   If that time shift cooked like that?? Do not cook ever to customer, you dont have any manner to selling food bro"}
{"text":"Yuk. I just moved from Durango and 215 and that place was never disappointing. I ordered the carne asada burrito tonight. My burrito was full of onions and drowned in gauc. Horrible in this location"}
{"text":"This food is so amazing. I just can't get over it. Carne asada fries are my Achilles heal! They're expensive and the service is cold at best but damn, this food is so bomb, so be it!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 of the burritos Carne assad plate the burritos were cold and they didn't even heat up the flour tortilla and the over salted the meat, they did even put pico de gallo in the burritos like the other Roberto on Decatur does...it's sad this is the closest Roberto to my house and the second time I have ordered there and it will be my last"}
{"text":"Parking was plentiful. Walked into the place and everything was clean and new. Was quickly greeted by the cashier and took my order. Was able to pay with my debit card and did have to pay an extra dollar for the service, it didn't faze me at all. I asked for a large piña drink with no ice and was surprised by the ginormousness of the cup. The salsa bar was clean and generous. My order came out quickly. The chile relleno was very good and so were the chips with guacamole. This place is just down the block from where i was staying at, so it will become my go to place for mexican food when i visit vegas."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Mexican place with legit California burritos 24/7. If you want Michelin Star restaurant service, search elsewhere. If you want bomb ass carne asada, you've come to the right spot."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive for what it is, however pretty good Mexican food none the less.  I have yet to try the cult favorite Carne asada fries, I'm really looking forward to it though. 3.7 stars"}
{"text":"I LOVE robertos. But this location is BY FAR the worst one. Don't ever go here at night. Literally a GUARANTEE that they get your order wrong! Third straight time that they could not deliver on a very simple order will never be back to this location again. Horrible. I only wish I could give less than one star. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We stopped by Roberto's to grab some breakfast. The bacon, egg, cheese & potato burrito was great and at a fairly good price!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Mexican place we've been to in the valley so far. Tacos Tijuana on the east side was as authentic as could be (they had sesos, bucha, tripas, lengua, etc), cheap (just north of $20 for the three of us), and made a killer salsa. That place was a definite 5 star joint.  Habaneros Taco Grill just down the street had a wider selection, generous portions, a salsa bar with three salsas, pico, radishes, limes and the requisite pickled carrots. Nothing stood out but neither did anything suck. It was very satisfying and we left full and happy.  Roberto's pickled carrots were much better than Habaneros' but that's about it when it comes to saying the former was better than the latter. Roberto's should've been good but something was strangely lacking. There was no wow or even an oo-o. The ambiance was a bit off, too. Maybe because it was kinda cold inside or maybe it was the way-too-big cutout photo on the wall of the not-so-happy-to-be-celebrating-50-damn-years elderly Latino couple staring at you while you tried to enjoy your meal. Something just wasn't right about the place.  People kept streaming in one by one but nobody but us stayed to dine in. It was all take out. Maybe nobody wanted to stick around to actually eat there with Mr. and Mrs. Roberto staring at you without a smile on. If I had been in business for 50 years with multiple locations, I think I'd have a smile as big as a hard shell taco stuffed with all the fixings.  Back to the food. It was just ok. We went there because of the ratings, felt like we got suckered in, and had to go somewhere else to get a real fix. We don't need to go back, unless it's to steal the pickled carrots to go along something from Habaneros."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's. It's perfect for any occasion. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Hangovers.   Pretty much anything on the menu is going to be delicious. My little go to is the Carne Asada Chimichanga. It runs about $7.50 but you get a huge fried burrito.  Normally, they just slightly dip it in oil and it's still soft. Couple this with the fact that they slap the guacamole and the sour cream right on the thing, you end up with a wet burrito.   The expert tip is to ask for it extra crispy and with the accouterments on the side. That way, you have a crispy chimichanga and you can add the sour cream and guacamole when you are ready, instead of letting it seep into your food. As a side, it doesn't hurt to get their chips and salsa as well. It also hits the spot.    Do your best Mission Impossible impersonation to get your green / red salsa and limes without touching the sneeze guard or dipping your hands in the food. Another pro tip (from my fiancee), you get the best mix of heat and flavor if you 4 little cups of green salsa with 1 cup of red and add 4-5 limes."}
{"text":"Woooaaaahhh!!! No se si cambiaron el cosinero pero hoy ordene unos tacos cual x sierto estan buenos pero hoy savian tan feos que hasta tuve que marcar para hacerles saver.  Segundo la salsa roja pense ay a lo mejor save feo x los tacos que compre pero no tambien la salsa nomas de pensar tenia un savor no muy placentero.! La verdad muy muy decepcionada!"}
{"text":"I used to use the drive thru 2-3 times a week for a breakfast burrito on my way to work (and this is my only perspective).  The people working there are always very polite and the food is tasty.  However, there are times where I wait at the speaker and wonder if it's broken as no one asks to take the order and no one is in front of me in the drive thru at least.  So, that has lead to driving off as I have to get to work.  Also MOST times, I don't get the salsa I asked for (I get the wrong kind) - being the drive through, I don't have access to the salsa bar.  This is frustrating as it obviously effects the taste and flavor expectations.   Note:  I edited this review after being called a \"Princess\" by someone named Moises through a private message - LOL.  Maybe I deserved that as I wrote another updated review in a moment of frustration.  However, the honest truth is, it's hard to plan how long this is going to take and what I'm going to end up getting - I may get the burrito with red sauce, I may get it with green.  I do wish I could know that.  I think it's time to bypass this place and find another similar place for my breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is okay for a 24 hour place. Be prepared for some loose stools in the morning, which is typical for a place like this but nothing too serious. Food was okay A bit salty it will leave a after taste in your mouth in the morning but for a quick Mexican bite to eat it is not too bad in the service was fine. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"It was decent food.  It is in a sketchy strip mall.  My experience wasn't as bad as some of the reviews,  I've had better."}
{"text":"I'm finally over this place.  They raised their prices, but quality is still the same.  17 buck for two burritos? Come one man!  I understand if We were on the strip or at a game with those prices, but your local spot you have been going to for 10 years?  I'm done.  Plus the service has gone waaaaaay down.  This used to be one of the best taco shops in the city...that has really changed."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time here in 2wks, and all 3 times the same cook was a huge asshole, and rude with such attitude. When we went the recent time, which was June 14th 2018 at 1am, my husband bought the chorizo, and he said it tasted spoiled, and the cook was watching my husband eating it, and was laughing the entire time. So I'm pretty sure it was spoiled and he did it purposely. My husband ended up so sick and throwing up all night. it's always the same guy after midnight. I spend a lot of money at Sam's Town, and don't deserve this type of service. Why do you have people like this working for you guys! So listen up people stay away from Roberto's after midnight! PS. We we're nothing but nice to this guy and even gave him a tip!"}
{"text":"I had the enchilada dinner.... by far the best Mexican food in town - maybe even the best Mexican food I have ever had. I have tried several different items on their menu and everything is great. My family goes weekly and every time a visitor comes to town this is the first stop after they get picked up from the airport. Amazing food, friendly staff, good experience."}
{"text":"I had just ordered a very simple order of 3 tacos, some carne asada fries and a horchata, when I got home I noticed some of my order missing. When I called not only could they not communicate whatsoever, they were extremely rude and unprofessional. Even so I was still polite, after being hung up on and pushed aside with no effort to help I decided to leave this review to warn future customers of the mess they may encounter at this location."}
{"text":"This is one of our local lunch and sometimes-post-gym spots, so my review has been long overdue.  Although the food seems somewhat pricey, especially the carne asada fries (never ordering that again when I can just get the carne asada torta w/ fries and a drink special), I have generally had pretty solid experiences here. The food is flavorful and the portions are reasonable. It might not be as \"authentic\" as some non-chain places, but it generally hits the spot and I don't mind eating here when Ross J's and Chicken Shack get a little boring or just aren't open late at night.  Overall, this is not a go-out-of-your-way destination, but a good local spot for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Roberto's location for many years now and have yet to be disappointed, so I wanted to make sure that I posted a review after picking up food from there again today. The staff is always so friendly and service is always quick. I never have to worry about the quality of the food whether they complete my order in 5 or 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star because you can't just put nothing.  NEVER eating there again!  I ordered a taco salad with chicken and absolutely no onions! when I received it there was a black hair sitting on it. I'm blonde so obviously not mine! I took it back up there and it looked like she was going to argue with me on it so I clearly pointed it out. They made me a new one but I couldn't sit down and eat now so I had to take it to go. When I got home and I noticed that now it was completely loaded with onions! When I called they told me that nothing they could do. Well I can't eat onions due to an allergy so I ended up throwing it away because they didn't want to remake it again or give me a refund.  Screw this place and their absolutely no customer service! Employees need to be fired, if you don't want to do your job then give it to someone that will and if the owners of this location don't care that a customer was treated like this then they deserve to be shut down"}
{"text":"I'm so over this location. This is by far the worst location for any Roberto's or other drive-thru I have visited. Recently went to grab 2 breakfast burritos, 1 ham and 1 bacon and I get home and what do I have? Two chorizo! How does this happen when I am the only vehicle in the green slime filled drive-thru? After driving back I now have to enter the location and I just want a refund at this point. The gentleman working the counter looks at me multiple times and doesn't come to ask my concerns. Finally after he finishes with other patrons he comes to ask what's wrong. I inform him my order is wrong and I just want my money back. He says I'll fix it where I again say no I want my money back. He then rings up other customers and one car thru the driv-thru and then decides to bring me my money. Hire some new personnel because these people are failing miserably."}
{"text":"didn't go to this location, but went to the one on craig road and the one on sunset, ordered the same thing at both locations: carne asada fries, and 5 rolled beef tacos, xtra large horchata.  When I first moved to Vegas, I would look foward to going back to California for Adalbertos or Baldos for the same exact thing, but this is my home away from home...both open 24 hours and both can give you a heart attack...but soo worth it.  This is one of those places where you can only order the carne asada fries maybe twice a month because it's so bad for you... but ohh so good!"}
{"text":"Cashier was super rude. Ordered 2 breakfast burritos and they gave us 2 Carne Asada burritos drowned in guacamole. We didn't realize it was the wrong order until we got back to work. Went back and explained what happened and she said that it's our fault and that we shouldn't of picked up the wrong order. Customer service was horrible, instead of apologizing and giving us what we paid for she decided to be nasty about it. To be honest I should of got a full refund after that type of service because after running back and forth food was cold and appetite was ruined. Will not be returning, food isn't that good anyways.. it's just convenient."}
{"text":"Do not eat here, go hungry instead! The worst fish tacos EVER! Seriously go to Jack in the box instead. Had their fish tacos and they were more like a pico de Gallo salad served on a regular cold size corn tortilla and fishing for the fish. Then the salsa was totally insipid no flavor what so ever. So disappointed and still hungry. Decided to go to sleep hungry and save my appetite for later today. People do go to bed hungry in America :("}
{"text":"I always call in our orders and they have them warm and ready when I get there. This location makes the Best Carne asada fries! Love these guys!"}
{"text":"FINALLY I found my Mexican joint in Las Vegas.  I knew I was on the right track when I walked in and every customer was speaking Spanish.  The food is very authentic and they even have Tacos de Cabesa, they also have some of the BEST Carne Asada Fries I have ever had (not really a Mexican deal, but definitely California style).  This is a little hole in the wall, but its not expensive the food is great and plentiful.  They have a condiment bar that has a couple choices of salsa, but lot's of homemade spicy carrots and such."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm from California where we have some amazing Mexican food. This place has legit food and great prices I was actually really impressed.   The tortas are hella good and I love the red salsa they have. Definitely give it a try!  Oh and it's open 24 hours!!!!"}
{"text":"We walked to Roberto's this morning at about 2 am, in search of good Mexican food. We are from Texas and are sick and tired of all this Baja style food out here, we wanted something a little more like Mexico City.  Well, we found it here!  We both loved our food. I had a chile relleno, chicken enchilada, chicken taco, beans, rice, and churro. He had chile relleno, tamale, beans, rice, and churro. Everything was very flavorful, just the way we like it. The verde sauce was good (very hot!), did not try the red salsa just because they usually all taste the same anyway... I'm a verde kind of girl.  The ONLY complaint we have is that my husband's tamale soaked up all the grease belonging to the chile relleno, so it ended up tasting like a plain-ish enchilada. My chile was on the side in its own package, so all the grease and goodness stayed where it belonged. (And if you're getting grossed out reading about grease, that's how real Mexican food should be, FYI. Eat it in moderation and you're perfectly fine. We like to eat but we are not fat.)  The meal made my husband sweat, which means it was good and spicy, just the way he likes it. He is the one that declared it to be 4 out of 5 stars. I liked having the scallions, radishes, and cucumber on the side. Nice touch at the condiment bar! Everything was cooked up nice and fresh, plenty of cheese on everything that needed cheese, no skimping. The churros were fantastic, reminded us of the churros at the State Fair of Texas, which are literally like tasting Mexico. Very delicious. I love that they don't just offer Horchata like everyone else, they also had 3 other fresh juices to choose from, plus the bottled Jarritos which are always good.  Everything made for good leftovers as well. Definitely priced well for the amount of food you get and the presentation. And if you're worried about spicyness, don't worry. I don't like spicy but my husband does, and we were both very satisfied. It's all in knowing how to use your condiments wisely."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, Roberto's is just one of those fixes you get when your craving carne asada fries. However I'm rating this solely on my experience this evening. I went through the drive thru after work and Gissell was amazing! She was very personable through the speaker and was very friendly when I pulled up. And I mean, really friendly! I enjoyed our little conversation, and she remembered all of my little extras that I like on the side :)"}
{"text":"Chicken taco came in a fried taco shell that was stale; lengua tasted like frozen roast beef."}
{"text":"Robertos is our go to Mexican fast food whenever we get a craving & no time to fix it homemade. Everything we've had is so good. The neighborhood isnt the safest or nicest in town, which is why i always send my husband, but its always worth it. We always call ahead with our order & are in & out in no time."}
{"text":"Stopped in before catching my flight home. The establishment is open 24/7 which would be a great place for your late night night munchies fix. Dine inside where there is ample seating and a salsa bar to spice up your favorite Mexican entree.  After cheking out the the menu  large posted menu, I went with a carnitas burrito and a side of sopas. They accept credit cards here and my order was up quickly.  The burrito which was packed with yummy pork, cilantro, and salsa - it was so large I could only eat half of it and half of  the yummy side entrée rice.  Definitely would recommend this place for your nevt Mex fast food fix."}
{"text":"Waited for over fifteen minutes at lake mead and rancho today (Monday 3/14/16) from 6:26-6:49 and there was no sorry or explanation for the wait. There was one car ahead of me for about five mins. Several minutes went by and no one came to the window. Paid $7.30 for a damn near 20 min burrito. Find another taco place if you want your food in under fifteen minutes. If the food is bad I'll write another review."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the entire chain, just this location. I hope the other locations are better then this one. Service is VERY slow inside and drive through. Portions are SMALL."}
{"text":"My husband and I really love this place. They are always fast and nice.  We usually get the \"Carne Asada Fries\" and some Chalupas to go. Oh! Don't forget your \"Agua de Piña.\""}
{"text":"I usually try to stay away from places like this because the meat tends to be so dry and really bad quality. BUT on drunken nights...I just can help but crave my standard carne asada burrito with the works (+avocado, sour cream, and hot sauce).    As for customer service, the man behind the counter was extremely nice eventhough he knew me and my partner in crime we beyond tipsy. Also the place is clean!  A plus was their selection of tasty fountain drinks: horchata, jamaica, & limon (the ones I remember)."}
{"text":"I love me some Roberto's! Great fast real Mexican food at cheap prices.  You can get your Mexican fix and be stuffed for under $10!  I love everything I have tried here and enjoyed trying new things too. My mind was blown when I had the carne asada fries. Yummy!"}
{"text":"It's a Roberto's. I used to be in love with the food here. Over the years that has faded. I also think the overall quality of food has as well. There are several locations all over Vegas. I do think Roberto's is better than a lot of spots you can eat. But after trips to mexico and a few out of this world food truck street tacos robertos is just average. It is average that I like to eat from time to time if I am craving it. I like it, I used to love it. It's still good just not great in my books."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and have for a long time.  I have my favorites from here and those are what I usually order.  They are the chicken tacos (2 or 3 at $0.99 each on Wednesdays) and an order of three rolled beef tacos with guacamole.  I also occasionally get the chicken burrito meal ($3.99 on Mondays).  I used to order the carne asada burrito (my dads favorite) but I don't care for the amount of onion in it and I always forget to aske them to leave it off.  Other highlights at Roberto's include the asada fries.  Think of them as nachos with fries instead of chips.  They are loaded with cheese, beans and carne asada.  I only ordered them once and that was enough for awhile.  They are insanely good but also monsterously big.  It was too much even for a big eater like me.  The same can be said about the chimichunga which I do at times order in a combo with rice and beans.  The beans are good but I can do without them.  The rice, on the other hand, is great and sometimes I just order a side of it because it is so good.    While the food quality at various Roberto's shops is pretty standard and equal to one another each location varies in its appearance and cleanliness.  This Roberto's which I go to most frequently is one of the cleanest I've seen.  I love coming in.  The only questionable area is the cold bar with the salsas, cucumber, radishes, green onions, limes and pickled jalapenos and carrots.  Despite the splatters of salsa soiling the stainless steel I still like to get some of the carrots, cucumber and radishes.  A nice refreshing crunch on the side with my tacos is sometimes just what the stomach ordered."}
{"text":"Sometimes Roberto's gets a bad reputation for being a dirty restaurant.  And perhaps some locations are.  But do not let that scare you.  This location on the east side of the valley is always clean as are many others across the Vegas Valley.  It is always open and it is always good. I love coming here.  Almost religiously I have to get the three rolled tacos with guacamole and maybe a taco or two.  Or if visiting on Wednesday, a handful of $0.99 chicken tacos.  And don't forget the pickled jalapenos and carrots with some radish and cucmber on the side.  The food is good.  It is fresh made.  They are fast.  The menu is not short of anything.   They even have this one creation called asada fries.  Think nachos with carne asada and all the other fixings on french fries instead of chips.  Awesome.  They are worth trying at least once and is almost guaranteed to fill you without a second thought.  I'm getting hungry as I write this.  And now that I think about it, today is Wednesday.  I think a taco run is in order tonight."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is on my way home but I don't think it is going to be my go to shop any more. It is so hit and miss.  Several months ago, when I first started coming here, I was shocked to find a young child running around the KITCHEN barefoot. Um, health code violation. I stayed and ate despite this and I wasn't thrilled with the tacos. Not because they were bad or anything. The chicken just had too much pepper for my liking. But I have continued my Wednesday stops since then. And more often than not I am pleased with what I get.  But tonight I am more upset than I ever have been at any Roberto's. I ordered my standard two chicken tacos and one order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. The cashier, clearly the new girl, looked at me like I had guacamole coming out of my nose. I repeated what I wanted and she could not find the button on the register. She finally pushed a button and asked again what meat I wanted. I told her beef. The price rang up less than what I had expected. Less than normal, that is. I knew something was amiss but said nothing. Thats on me. I should have checked the recipt sooner. It showed chips with cheese. And also beef with no price next to it. Cool. I'm getting nachos with beef, right? Not quite. I got, quite literally, chips with cheese. Not even melted cheese. Not a single piece of beef. And my standard tacos were way sub par. They were cold. Colder even than the chips that wouldn't even melt the cheese. And the taco shells were not crispy anymore. They were soggy and chewy. Clearly these tacos are premade and only finished with lettuce and cheese right before they wrap and bag them. It makes me wonder why I waited nearly 10 minutes for my food when it wasn't even warm. I guess I'll start going a little further for my Wednesday indulgence."}
{"text":"I like Roberto's Taco Shops a lot. I look forward to Wednesday nights when I can get a couple of $0.99 chicken tacos. And an order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Those are a little more but oh so worth it. This has become a Wednesday night tradition for me. This past Wednesday was no different. What was different about this latest visit was the location. I came to the shop on Russel Road at Boulder Highway as I was in the area. I got my usual order as outlined above and eagerly awaited my mid week treat. The shop was busy this night as is often the case on cheap taco night so it took a few minutes to get my food. I was never disappointed with what I ate though there were some differences from what I am used to. The rolled tacos with guacamole were fine. Crispy and all. The guacamole seemed thin and bland compared to other Roberto's locations. The cheese was pleantiful but not at all melted. The tacos had more chicken than what I get at other shops. That was nice. They were actually pretty solid. What I did not care for as much is the amount of black pepper in the chicken. It was a little heavy handed for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed my meal. My reasoning for a 3-star rating is for the restaurant itself. It seemed dark. Dimly lit if you will. With the area it is in and some of the scary looking people around, I felt a little uncomfortable. Also, when I was ordering, I saw young girl of about 4 or 5 running around the back of the kitchen barefoot. I'm pretty sure she was the child of one of the workers. Perhaps the manager even. But I also fairly certain it is not OK. A child should not be roaming a restaurant at all. Let alone doing it barefoot. Surel there was an office she could have sat in if they had no place else for her. I don't know. That just bothered me. Had I not been hungry and this not been the most convenient Roberto's at the time I would have left."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a quick drive thru for some Mexican food.  We drive by this almost daily and decided to try it.   My husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  He stated he liked it...but it was a typical breakfast burrito.  I ordered the carne asada platter.  The meat was really tough.  The rice and beans were standard.  There wasn't any guacamole.  But the tortillas were really good.   We thought we were going to be able to go thru the drive thru quickly, however, it took forever!  I don't see us going back because we like Laurita's on Maryland and Pebble much better."}
{"text":"Ew ew ew! Why did I try this place again?! I had a friend rave over their chicken tacos so we went on Wednesday when they are a dollar. They weren't even worth that! Horrible. No taste at all and the tortilla was inedible. It wasn't soft but wasn't crispy. Every time I think I'm going to like Robertos, I am proven wrong. I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Ok... So I was under the impression that Robertos was the place to go after a night of indulgence.  (Which I have done many times). Having said that I could not provide an accurate review due to lack of memory. I know I was always happy with the food in my belly but at 3:00 am I was not in a position to accurately describe until now. On a recent visit to Robertos during the day with zero alcohol in my system I had the pleasure  of enjoying one of their chicken burritos. Omg this was good. I mean really good. All white meat, sautéed onion and green peppers. I added beans and sour cream. For $5.50 this can't be beat!  I enjoyed 1/2 of that burrito for lunch and finished off the rest at dinner. Yum"}
{"text":"It's 24 hours so that's a plus it's cheap the food is what you'd expect from can food and such but if you're ever have the munchies it should do the trick their horchata is bomb tho their service however isn't"}
{"text":"I always order Carne Asada Fries or Carnitas Burrito. The meat is always fresh and yummy. You also get fresh cucumbers and green onions. This is my favorite Don Tortaco!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, brand new building, clean salsa bar and great combo prices. Would recommend the carne asada burrito special number two."}
{"text":"We came here after bowling last night, around 12:30 am or so.  Some of us were a little drunka nd annoying lol, the employees here were really cool about it.  Took our orders and our food was out promptly.  I ordered the carne asada fries, minus the carne asada (I am a vegetarian) and some how when i got home I had my friends, meat filled fries lol (not the fault of the restaurant) I tried to pick as much as i could, and what i could eat was amamzing. I will be going back soon so I can have my vegitarian yummies."}
{"text":"If they get your order right you are in for some great Mexican food. Only thing in Vegas that makes me forget Tito's back home. 24 hour drive thru too!!!"}
{"text":"Shhhh! This is our favorite chicken taco lunch. Inexpensive,  packed with delicious shredded chicken and cheese. Hometown best bet."}
{"text":"Not all robertos are created equally...this one is horrible. Staff is rude, asked for no meat got meat...lucky asked for no cheese and they actually did give me any, but skimped on the fries and the drink...horrible. The one next to my work is so much better"}
{"text":"I got carne asada fries today, paid extra for salsa, got no salsa inside at all... the guy knows what I want cause he charged me for it. I don't know why u need this dish without the main ingredients... really pissed"}
{"text":"Great place to go to when you are craving food in the middle of the night. Best carne asada fries I've had in Vegas!  I chose this location simply because I like to be able to go inside and sit to wait for my food. Unlike the Charleston location inside the car wash place.  This location has been the best one I've ever been too. Extremely clean! And very friendly. My food was made just how I wanted it In a timely manor. This is my new favorite location for sure!"}
{"text":"I've always been a Roberto's fan...I Just Love this Place! I know that they have shut down a few locations in Las Vegas, but I was Very happy when I Found this one Close to My Sister's House. It is located on the SouthWest Side of Las Vegas, You can get the Specific Directions here on Yelp!  This Particular one is a little small, but Very Clean....It does get a little busy, so there may be a wee bit of a wait time! I've Tried their Beef Rolled Tacos Plate which comes with Spanish Rice, and Refried Beans with Melted Cheese.  They do top it with Guacamole, but you can tell them you don't want it. Their Carne Asada Nachos is/are enough for 2 people. Or One if you are Really Hungry! Chimichangas, Carne Asada Fries...Are also Way on Top of My Yummage List here!   They do have a little Condiment Bar where you can get your sauces, and the soda machine is of course...Free Refills!   You Ask if I'd go Back, No Doubt About it!!!!"}
{"text":"This Roberto's has the Same Menu Items as the Rest of them in the Las Vegas Valley! Same Furnishings as The Others as well! I had No Problems with My Order...They were Pretty Quick with My Order.   They do have a lot of Parking, as they are sharing with other Businesses in that little Strip Mall! They are Open 24 Hours, and I think this location is a Fairly New One!  Just be Wary of some of the Drivers in the area, at times they don't look when they are Backing out of the Parking Stall, or Keep on Driving when they were Suppose to Stop at the Stop Sign!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast burrito! Potato, egg and cheese reminds me of my grandma's breakfast tacos :)"}
{"text":"Cleanest place I've seen yet!!! It's so good here. I'm from Tucson Arizona and I have seen dirty restaurants but this is spotless!!! Great job guys!!! I will definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  Lately the carne asada burritos have been grizzily and pico was overpowered by onions.  But today, 99cent chicken tacos they did not have at 9:40PM even though the special is until midnight.  This is not the first time this has happened to me at this location.  And the girl who works there, her english is not so great.  All she said was special out, rather than we have no more, we ran out, etc.  Of course no substitute was offered.  I think I will have to stick with Don Tortaco."}
{"text":"Cheap Mexican food that is delicious!  You get a lot of food for not very much money.  The meat here is good.  I've never had a burrito filled with fatty meat.  But what really makes the burritos good are the tortillas!  I don't know how they make them so good but they are da bomb!!!  The only things that I don't love is the location, in a gas station, and they charge you to use a credit card."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and I really like it. This last visit I got the bean tostada. I was surprised at how filling it was. There were a lot of toppings, and not all lettuce. There was a good amount of beans, some lettuce and cheese.   I love that they have a 'salsa bar' there, complete with to go containers. There are salsas, vegetables and even sliced limes. Limes are a must have in my opinion, as they really make the flavor pop.  My husband got the al pastor burrito, as he had been craving this for a few days. He was really pleased with the flavor. The burrito was also very filling.   Great value for the money. Love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I have always had good food at this location. The tacos, tostadas and burritos are always hot and fresh.   I love the crispy shells for the tacos and the tostadas. A bit too much lettuce at times, but there is always plenty of 'the good stuff', otherwise known as the meat and cheese. Their pastor (adobada) is my husband's favorite burrito. Everything is made to order, and is worth the wait.   I like that they offer a condiment bar with green onions, lemons or limes, salsas and another veggie mix."}
{"text":"Actually, the Roberto's I want to review is on Cheyenne.  Quick/cheap/efficient/tasty.  Love this place.  24/7.  Easy parking.  Favorite!!"}
{"text":"I don't suggest this place because I came here with another person and when we ordered our food they were having difficulties working the register so after we ordered our food we sat down and waited to get our food to go and after 30 minutes they came out from the kitchen and said are you waiting for someone and so we said we are waiting for our food and they hadn't even started making it so we got our money back and went to another place nearby called don tortaco and I really suggest them."}
{"text":"Been here many times! Their C/Asada Fries are to die for! It costs $8.76 at the moment.   They are open 24 Hours! Inside cleanliness is decent but is comparable to Taco's El Gordo.   Overall good taco shop on the east side!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time was just OK, average taco shop fare. The staff has a hard time with communication in English, but no big deal. Well the second and LAST time, I had to explain 3 times what I wanted. then when it was served, looked and smelled worse. The girl behind the counter was rude. So into the trash the food went and out the door I went."}
{"text":"Open 24/7 in a sketchy strip mall. BUT don't, absolutely don't, let that fool you. This place is off the hook when it comes to good Mexican food. Want a delicious breakfast burrito? Then this place is where it's at...I love their carne asada, adobado, and chorizo.  Pick your poison, they've got it.  My go to place any time I'm at Nellis AFB or in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I love robertos, but this is the worse location in las vegas. I have visited this location 3 times total in hopes that they would improve. The first two times i was sent home with the wrong order. The 3rd time my boyfriend found a tooth pick in his rice. It was sitting at the bottom of the rice. Not only that, the rice smelled like fish and was mushy. We called the store and they wanted us to come by the next day and bring the food to them for a refund. we didn't even bother to waste any more time on this Roberto's location. I do not recommend this location. I'd have to say the best location in town is off decatur and Hacienda."}
{"text":"hello my name is kat and im a robertos addict. its all about the carnitas nachos!"}
{"text":"Love the food, super fast service. Counter service friendly and patient.  Sooo happy there is a Roberto's on this side of town. The menu is extensive and they will substitute. Always look forward to Taco Wednesday,  so yummy."}
{"text":"First attempt was understandable ordered some nachos with no beans oops we put beans on it no big deal remake the older, silly me doesn't check it because I'm in a rush, at work I find this time we got fries instead of nachos (I'm not trying to be a crazy picky jerk but the fries get soggy much faster, I would never order them to-go) Still no problem at this point! I call these guys back they say \"hey our mistake bring the fries in when you get off work, we will swap them out for you!\" Cool no harm no foul. I found something to eat at work and I'll enjoy my Roberto's after work instead of before however... on our third try the graveyard shift makes the order just as specified except this time after two bites I realize that not only does the beef taste like charcoal it feels room temperature... I'm in the Industry so I get it, maybe they just cleaned the grills and we sure would hate to make them dirty again right? but really? I would rather be told \"no!\" instead now I'm worried that the two bites of improperly handled meat is going to make me vomit copious amounts over the next several days.   Sorry for the rant but this is just one example, this location has been failing a lot as of late. Who knows, maybe the staff are sick of working there, maybe the managers aren't paying attention to this location anymore, whatever it is just trust me enjoy your Roberto's but don't go to this location, especially late night."}
{"text":"This location WAS top notch for a Robertos but lately the service here has gone down hill. I almost always go inside to order. They used to get all my orders right the first time but the last handful of time they would somehow get it wrong. Missing plates, wrong protein and almost always never ring up the drink even though you ordered it which sucks when you need to make another order just for the drink. Food just seems to be piled into plate with no passion. The glass they had installed at the counter for whatever reason is kind of a bother but i understand its a preventive measure for criminal activity. They need to change that cheap order mic and speaker through the glass as it is hard to hear and speak to the worker taking your order. Hopefully service wil change for the better in the future. The food is always great but all these issues make it easy not to go back"}
{"text":"Most terrible service ever, food is ALWAYS made wrong. Literally they can't do anything right. Every time i come in I get terrible service, even after I ask them to repeat my order to me they mess ALWAYS seem to mess something up, whether it's \"forgetting\" a few things on my order or they make my food all wrong. I keep going back in hoping that the next time will be better than the last, but it's been the opposite of that every time.They always cheat me out of my money, when I say that I mean, I see on my receipt that I did pay for what I asked, and when I get my food I see that I'm missing some food and when I ask for the missing food, they say I still have to pay for then even though I showed them that I already have. I always tip and I'm always the nicest to them, I don't do or say anything to deserve such horrible service. Obviously they need new employees. Long and terrible story short, they are shit and don't go if you don't want a zesty spit dressing in your food."}
{"text":"God I hate Roberto's. The burritos are so damn sloppy and it looks like someone opened up a tortilla and took big a dump in it. It's like pig slop. Chicken burrito has more onions and peppers then chicken."}
{"text":"I'm big on customer service but this has the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced.  The neon looking guacamole was disgusting and the food was not even good. This place does not even deserve a star and I will not be returning.  Folks, give your well earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of a Los Angeles taco stand.  I walked here from The Hard Rock which only took a few minutes.  I ordered a potato burrito and it came out perfectly; just like grandma used to make.  It has just enough firm fried potatoes and eggs to make my mouth happy.    The fresh red picante sauce is spicy!  Yum.  Love the marinated jalapeños and carrots, which all taco stands should carry.  Radishes and cucumbers help cut the heat.  They even have the traditional plastic bags for the veggies like in LA.  It's very clean and service was swift.  The menu looks huge and includes menudo on the weekends, a great hangover cure.  I'll try the chills relleno next time.    No coffee but go next door to Dunkin' Donuts for that."}
{"text":"I ordered from Roberto's Taco shop after passing it several time on my way home. The place always looks busy and it's open 24 hours.  Pros: I revived a huge chicken chimichanga combination plate with beans and rice for 8 dollars and some change. The portions are huge and you are for sure to have some left over.  Cons: the chicken was bland and the food did not deliver. I have had better chimichangas and for a lower price. The customer service is also good.  I would not recommend wasting your money at Roberto's Taco shop. I literary throw away my food after a few bites.  Just a huge disappointment"}
{"text":"Best Taco salad ever!!!!!! We've tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The shrimp burrito is a must! Filled with large shrimp and veggies. The taco salad has a crispy, flaky she'll and the chicken is full of flavor. The tacos are huge and worth every penny. Chile relleno burrito is to die for, oh my goodness....."}
{"text":"Wait wasnt long. Only problem is the food quality is different.. It's like they changed their cooking procedures. The toungue taco doesnt really taste the same, small stringed out pieces instead of the chunks. Kind of on the really salty side. No more Horchata refills....That is a no no. You cant just take something away that people were so acustomed to...Oh well when I am desperate I'll come here."}
{"text":"I've tried Roberto's once before and I wasn't too impressed until my fiancé said that I needed to try the Carne Asade Fries. His advice is to get this to go, because you get more bang for your buck. He came home with this one day as a \"snack.\" It is not a snack.....it is HUGE! Between the two of us we could barely finish it. There was plenty of carne asada, fries, cheese, etc! It was flavorful, but I am sure eating this all the time will definitely clog up those arteries. I would recommend it to anyone with a craving for something greasy, meaty and yummy! For less than 10 bucks a pop, it is definitely worth your money if you need a quick remedy for a hangover or if you just want to enjoy some fries!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican place in Las Vegas. Everything tastes fresh and is of a higher quality than most other Mexican places.  I think their secret is using East Indian roti/naan for their burrito shells. That's basically what it is, and I've not seen any other Mexican place do this. If you're Indian or from the Caribbean, you're going to love this place. Closest you'll get to a roti shop without going to NYC, Toronto or the homeland."}
{"text":"Customer service needs to be improved. First time being in the place we ordered off the special menu to the right of the counter and the gal didnt ask us if it was off the special menu or the regular menu even tho she seen us over by the special of the day poster.  She puts our order in wrong. Then she gets rude. She could of asked \"the number #3 here or over there?\" (each no. has two diff meals)Then we were rudely  told  how to order correctly the next time.....very rude on her part. I really cant see the next time happening. Food was good but her customer service was uncalled for."}
{"text":"Really sweet workers, but this food is not good. It's really bland and just disgusting."}
{"text":"Taco shop style mexican food. Perfect for late night munchies, especially after you've had a few drinks. Greasy and delicious! The bean n cheese, and breakfast burritos take the cake! Also there's a salsa bar with spicy carrots, salsa, and green onions too. The salsas need a little work though."}
{"text":"The best food for a late night coming home from a bar! Love their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I stays up in here, I am considered a regular, especially the the night crew knows you AND your order. (Don't judge me ) I like rolled tacos, but where I come for they call 'em ROLL tacos. Hahaha  Out of convenience #1 late night food spot for me, I get the same all the time 3roll tacos and a fish taco. Never disappoint, always clean, very nice staff and speedy service"}
{"text":"I love this place, yes there are many \"TACO SHOPS\" (that's what we call the @ home) here in Vegas but this location here is the BEST.  What makes this location great? Fast service, nice people: the workers actual extend the conversation past taking your order. Clean at all hours of the day, condiments are always fresh i.e. fresh salsa, crisp-crunchy carrots, peppers, cucumbers, raddishes. Food always comes out piping hot, they did reinvent the wheel here they just keep it SIMPLE. I will pass up 10 different taco shops and drive clear across town to get to this SPECIFIC location to order something as simple as 3-Rolled Tacos w/ guac, cheese and hot carrots. It reminds me of Rolberto's off of El Cajon Blvd/28th in San Diego...oh goodtimes, goodtimes I'm over here cracking up reminiscing. Try it out if you happen to be on THAT side of town."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and has been for FIFTEEN YEARS! Anytime I break down and try them again I regret it. The carnitas had an absolutely AWFUL flavor tonight. I waited in the drive through TWENTY MINUTES for garbage food I ended up throwing in the trash. Just close this dump already and put something good in here."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Roberto's to go to until the quality and customer service went to the dumps... what happened :( ... the lady at the drive tru does not pay attention and has screwed up our orders several times we are over it not to mention the health department needs to visit this location its pretty dirty inside so we will no longer use this Roberto's till they clean up their act."}
{"text":"I had the chorizo and eggs burrito. Everything about it is amazing. The tortilla is perfect and chewy. Top it with red salsa; it's a little spicy but it has a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"We've been to many of these Roberto's locations all over the city (across UNLV, near Valley High, Rancho shopping center, Sahara/ Sloan, Decatur/Charleston, etc.), but the food quality at this one is terrible. We won't be coming back. Hubby really wanted RTS this past friday night. This is in our area, so we tried it. Not good. At all. Also, the drink machine needed more syrup. Hubby noted that it was all women working there.   Hubby got a breakfast burrito but there were some mysterious black things that he kept pulling out of it. He also noticed that the ham they used was the cold-cut kind (very cheap low-quality meat). At all of the other locations that we've been to, ham steak is the norm. I got the beef rolled tacos with sour cream, cheese, and guacamole. The beef was a sad color, didn't look fresh, felt lukewarm (it wasn't hot or crunchy like it usually is from other locations), and the worst of it, was that I pulled out a one inch piece of fat---I  saw it before eating it. YUCK! WTH! So, after all that, I lost my appetite. (I actually wanted everything out of my system pronto. Even just thinking about it is grossing me out, too.)   This was really gross. We're trying another one (RTS) in the area (there are other options). From the looks of things here, looks like other Yelp reviewers are on the same page."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a super clean location.  I am a huge fan of Robertos' taco shops. Love getting bean and cheese burritos, chips, breakfast burritos, and recently fell in love with chimichangas.  My only complain about the chimichangas is that some locations (this one included) will smother your burrito with guacamole and sour cream. I am not a fan of that because I want to crispness of the burrito shell. When it is smothered in something wet like sour cream, it defeats the purpose of deep frying my burrito and just makes it a soggy mess. Also, the burritos are the size of a small infant, so I need to split that meal up and it gets soggy and gross sitting in the fridge with guac sauce on it.  Easily fixed by asking for toppings on the side."}
{"text":"This used to be a Roberto's.  Now it's called Maria's.  Pretty much the same menu though, and might even be the same employees.  I ordered a california burrito and a cheese quesadilla.  Burrito was fine, but was missing guacamole.  I'm not sure if they forgot to put it in, but carne asada without guacamole is just plain wrong.  Quesadilla was okay.  I would have preferred for it be more buttery and for the tortilla to be more flakey though."}
{"text":"Roberto's doesn't hold up in comparison to the other places that have opened up or the food trucks around Vegas.  Just not a fan of fast mex food.  There are other places up and about. Old school Mex Food and taco shops.  Even Taco y Taco play music and have liquor and better tasting items in my opinion.  Chipotle, Zabas and the other fast casual \"Mexican\" grills taste better and don't make me run for the bathroom or make me feel too full or heavy.  The employees aren't terrible, though they speak English well enough or perfectly, the service can only go so far.  Roberto's just feels like an old outdated restaurant to me.  It seems cheap but carne asada fries with a drink is still about $10-$11 dollars, and you can spend just 9 at Chipotle and feel satisfied but not grossly packed in your stomach.  All in all i can't say i'll be wanting to come back to Roberto's."}
{"text":"I was just there through the drive through. I love going to robertos. I have been a customer for years and have never been so disrespected. She was obviously too busy to take our order. She was talking to all her coworkers and talking on the headset (not taking orders). Besides the disrespect she got my order wrong. Which she repeated back to me 4 times. So I don't understand how it was messed up. I will now take my money to Fausto's where they treat their customers better."}
{"text":"A reliable 24/7 Taco food chain. They have $0.99 chicken tacos on Wednesday. Yummy and good deal. I like how staff are very friendly and helpful. Baltazar was very accommodating to a big prder I had and helped me. Favorites are carne  asada fries and california burrito."}
{"text":"Cayman boyfriend was drunk waiter was rude (julio) told him I only wanted one chicken taco roll he was trying to charge me for 3 finally took my order after I asked to speak to manager and he still didn't allow me to"}
{"text":"Gotta love Roberto's. There always open.  Carna asda buritto wet is yummi."}
{"text":"Their tacos are amazing for a \"fast-food-not-so-real taco place\"   And its open 24/7!  Servers look bored and unhappy, thats why im giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"I used to like this place except now the service with an awful sour attitude! Food is ok as compared to other nearby Mexican restaurants. I suggest going somewhere else! I highly do not recommend this place until they change service attitude!"}
{"text":"All is can say is Gross! This comes from a guy whom lived in North East LA for 13 years!"}
{"text":".99 chicken tacos on Wednesday? Hells yea!  This is basically the only reason why I come here. The tacos are super oily but they actually taste good with some of their red salsa! If you come here their food consistency is not always the same, the tacos anyway.  The first time they were hella hard with a little bit of chicken, the second time they were perfect and this last time they were perfect shells with a little chicken and not enough cheese. For .99cents you really cant expect more though.  My coworker got the rolled taquitos with guac and asked for sour cream, they charge 1.10$ for that, WTF!? They also charge that for guac. Its totally insane to charge that much for sour cream though! The guac was already oxidizing by the time we got back to work, like 5 mins away.  They have a salsa bar, but the place is cramped and people always take wayyyy more than they should. They do offer green onions here, which not all Robertos offer.   The place itself is pretty clean, and customer service is so-so. The cashier is usually in a hurry and just trying to get orders in as quickly as possible so she isnt super nice.  I will continue to come here for their cheap tacos, but thats about it LOL.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I havent had carne asada fries in a looooonnngggg time! I've been being a good girl and going to the gym and avoiding these 3,000 calorie mofos!   One night a few days ago I decided to go, at first I was very hesitant then I said eff it! So I park and walk up to the window. They just looked at me like I was stupid. I ordered asked for no pico and paid. The lady recited the order to the dude and he said something, which I couldnt hear (Spanish is my 2nd language) and thy both laughed... I was a little annoyed by that. I went into the store and got a tea and poked around.  I went back to get my order, which was just sitting by the window in a bag. I looked into the window and they were again sitting in the back of the kitchen talking. I gestured like, is this mine? I mean shit, I didnt want them to have to get off their ass to get me another couple red salsas so I just left.   I got home and looked at my sinful foodz and they looked sooooooo yummy! I hesitated! And of course I was let down : ( They looked amazing but were def bland, all was bland! BOO!  No mas Robertos for me!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for Taco Wednesday!  This specific Roberto's, imo, has the biggest tacos. I've been to the one by UNLV and they do not put as much chicken as this one does. How can you go wrong with .99 tacos!?  The tacos are pretty greasy, so I just wrap them in a napkin.  I know what you're saying, 4 stars for Roberto's? YES. The customer service here is awesome, they're so nice and accommodating. Here they also have one of the better salsa bars, their red salsa is one of the best I've had out of 3 others Roberto's. They also have cucumbers! Not those crusty white ones, delicious green, crunchy ones! They also have green onions, and other stuff.  Location is usually always clean, especially with how busy they are!   Catch me here on Wednesdays!  Yay!"}
{"text":"BIG, THICK, BURRITOS!  OK, so I've had the carne asada fries which are totally BOMB! I ordered a california burrito this time, I was pumped... and let down! WTF! ANY Calif burrito I've had included : fries, carne asada, sour cream, guacamole, and cheese (pico if you like it) This one only had cheese and freakin carne asada! I was pretty pissed! I ate only half because the tortilla tasted sweet and was just irritated! I really dont want to pay 5$ for meat and cheese! UGH!   Go for the carne asada fries! The plus is they are open 24hrs and have a drive through!"}
{"text":"Not sure this is the very one I had a breakfast taco this am. Close enough. Was fresh prep and really good, as I watched. I would surely return. Thanks folks. Well done."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service! Got my order completely wrong and had to drive back. The cook looked at me like I killed his puppy when the cashier went to talk to him about it. Then not one apology for the inconvenience!  The food isnt good enough to go back and deal with that to me! So long Robertos!"}
{"text":"I eat at this Robertos all the time BUT a couple weeks ago my daughter found short black hair in her chicken tacos they were apologetic and i gave it another try well today i bought a breakfast burrito i cut it in half to give my son the other half when i proceed to put hot sauce a small black hair inside attached to the potatoe just gross i took it back right away and the cook tells me he never had complaints before i told him thats the 2 nd time it happened well they gave me the money back and i left still hungry will not return again just gross and kind of rude made it look like i put it there ugh"}
{"text":"Had breakfast  here and the employee was the only one working.  He completed  my order and was able to assist others without taking a long time. Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"I love burritos but these people take longer then a snake to fart. It should be called a drive through. ..it should be called a drive, stop for 20 minutes,  check if ur order is right  n drive through."}
{"text":"Went to this location today at 4:45 pm, meet the rudest cashier. She took my order wrong and talk back to me when I pointed out to her, than refund the wrong amount of money to me. I been coming here since it opened. I will never return to this location again. I asked for a manager and she said she was the manager. I don't think a business should Keep this kind of manager to run their business."}
{"text":"Came here around 2ish and all the staff were cleaning. I stood there unnoticed for a bit since they were all busy. I was helped by a young gentlemen, and ordered carne Asada fries. It didn't take too long to make, and the food was delicious! They also have salsas and such for you to take with your meal."}
{"text":"I do not like to complain about the food is terrible, this place tops the cake. Not only do you have to wait til they are done doing what they do which is not waiting on customers. The food is terrible. They try to compensate by burying it in salt. So called chili has no flavor what so ever.  Never again will I eat there or any other Roberto's. I have noticed that they do not have any quality control. It is good to have 60 different locations but when you do not have quality control you have 60 locations that are on a downward spiral. What a shame making money by selling crappy food."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced, authentic Mexican food. Bottomless pickled carrots and 254 calories apiece shredded chicken burritos. Count me in."}
{"text":"I could eat here practically every day (and almost do!). Healthy (if you want), cheesy and greasy (if you want!). Bottomless relish bar. My favorite place!"}
{"text":"Very close to real Mexican food, and very cheap, very popular, we went there a few times in a row, there is always space available but always busy. Great choice when you are on a budget. They have some medium spicy salsas to dress it all up with :)"}
{"text":"This review Is for the location on Centennial. I won't bore you about how \"I'm from California and thus and expert about Mexican food.\" As Roberto's and dang near every Mexican restauranteur is either from California or Mexico.  I usually pick up a burrito on Thursdays because that's my busy day at work and it's convenient to grab food from Roberto's on my way to work and it sticks with me all day even if I don't get a lunch. I'm thankful they are opened 24 hours as I can order whatever I want; breakfast or lunch.  The food tastes authentic, hot and ...fresh?? Or shall I say not as greasy as other locations. Some locations are heavy on the salt but the cooks here make their food well. The restaurant is always clean. On my last visit, the cashier came from outside after sweeping. He washed his hands upon entering the kitchen and taking my order. This stood out to me because I work in healthcare and am mindful of such behaviors.  The cook came out and struck up a conversation with me in broken English. I couldn't really understand him but I appreciated the customer service enough to take the time to write this review."}
{"text":"Very dirty inside. Food was okay and I love Mexican but got it twice now and it's always dry and not very fresh/warm. Tired a few different things and just not for me at this location. Needs an updated inside and needs to be cleaner"}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Roberto's I've ever been in. I know that's Roberto's isn't exactly a 5 star joint, but this was most worst experience ever. The cashier was so unbelievably rude. Yes, they were busy. Dinner Rush was going on but that does not excuse a negative attitude toward guest. The cashier did not greet me in any way at all and she was almost yelling at the old woman in who was in front of me.  The food quality was mediocre, but the service is what will prevent me from dining here again."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews, especially when the food is good, but after what happened here last night I feel like I have to write this.  Based on the rest of the reviews I read, it seems there is a pretty consistent problem with some of the female staff at this location.    My girlfriend and I used to love this place.  The food is decent, cheap, its close to our condo, and its open 24 hours.  Perfect spot for some late night grub.  So we went last night to grab some dinner.  We had also been by that morning to split a breakfast burrito, so to go twice in one day, you know the food must be good.  I wasn't feeling well so I took a seat while my girlfriend ordered.  I wanted a carne asada burrito, but after the order was placed, I heard the cashier tell the cooks to make carnitas.  I thought that maybe I either heard wrong or she was talking about a different order.  When the food came, I double checked the ticket and saw that they had in fact rung it up as carnitas.  I am not a picky person, and if they had made another meat, such as beef or chicken, I probably wouldn't have said anything, but I don't eat pork so it had to be sent back.   My girlfriend told the cashier that she asked for Carne Asada, not Carnitas, and asked if they could remake a new burrito for me.  The cashier obviously just misheard her order, which is understandable as they sound similar.  I thought this would be a very simple \"Oh, I'm sorry about that, let me get you what you asked for\" type situation, but boy was I wrong.  The cashier became aggressive and rude, telling us that she ordered carnitas, thats what it says on the ticket, and if we want another burrito that we have to pay for another one.  At this point, I was shocked at the way she said it, so I stood there for a moment trying to process what was happening.  The cashier then doubled down saying she was busy and wanted to know what we wanted to do.  At this point, completely baffled by what was happening, I told my girlfriend to leave the burrito on the counter and we went next door to get a sandwich.    This was such a stupid problem; a simple misunderstanding that was handled so poorly.  Over something that maybe costs your business a few dollars, you're going to lose a customer?What is sad is this cashier probably thinks that she did a good job by saving the restaurant some money.    Well, you may have saved a few bucks by not making me a new burrito, but you have forever lost two customers that enjoyed your food.  I'm also disputing the charge on my credit card, so instead of saving money, you are getting nothing, and you lost your food cost.  Sucks.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  Don't assume because I'm a \"gringo\" that I don't speak Spanish.  I'm sure that some of your customers would love to hear what you really think about them."}
{"text":"Every single time I have came to this location, they cannot get my simple order right. RIDICULOUS. If I could leave them a negative star I would!"}
{"text":"I got food poisionin from this place last night , i do not like this location .i got sick af i ordered 3 chicken tacos and carne asada fries never aagain"}
{"text":"We ordered food by phone said it would be ready in 10min, we got there paid and still took 20-25mins, turns out our food had been ready but the lazy cashier charged us and didnt give us our food"}
{"text":"Drive through takes a ridiculously long amount of time every single time :(  food is good, staff is friendly. Just wished they would try something to get a faster turn around with drive through it probably will be faster if you order inside."}
{"text":"I once drove around for an hour trying to find this Roberto's. A little nicer and cleaner than other Roberto's but the food is the same no matter which Roberto's you stop in at.   Best meal at 3am when you're belligerently drunk trying to find your way home. They always mess up my order. But whatever they give me, I finish it all. I heart the steak nacho's with extra salsa and sour cream. The best deal is the crunchy chicken taco with a chicken enchilada combo. I love how they stuff the taco with loads of shredded chicken, a little lettuce and tons of cheese.  The enchilada compliments it quite nicely.  The guacamole is processed but what the \"o lay\" do you expect for great mexican food at these cheap prices? Skip the beans, they aint  that great either. Tacos, enchilada's, nacho's, burrtio's, you can't go wrong ordering any of these.  Don't even think about going to Taco hell.  I hear if you flash em in the drive through, it's free."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I tried some horrible cardboard chicken tacos here over two years ago (and haven't been back since) and thought I learned my lesson. Came in here late night, figured I'd try a lengua burrito at the listed menu price of $5.65. Tack on a small cheese quesadilla and a drink + use of a credit card and I get hit with $15.53. Are you kidding me? I asked what the \"misc\" charge of $3.70 was and I was told \"oh, it's for the lengua\" even though it says right on their menu that it is $5.65. Instead of arguing and risking getting my food spit in, I just paid the bill.  The food was bland, the price was unreasonable and unexplainable (I don't mind paying a premium if it's stated in the menu) the salsa bar was a disgusting mess.  I hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location. Had Postmates deliver as we were very busy. My original order was 2 shrimp cocktails and three rolled beef tacos w/guacamole and side of rice and beans. When he delivered our order he informed us that Roberto's told him they weren't able to make the cocktails as they didn't have the shrimp. (That sucked but ok) What they actually made was 6 chicken rolled tacos with cheese and a bean and cheese burrito..  Damn Roberto's. The most disappointing hang over cure ever!"}
{"text":"First time at this Roberto's location. First off, the food is absolute delicious here. I ordered beef machaca burrito for breakfast and it was delicious. The flour tortillia was thin and  not caky like here in TX. I wish they make these types of burritos here in TX. If they do, I have not found that taqueria yet. I only seen this on the menu at IHOP around here. Roberto's makes good tacos and it's always my destination when I am in Las Vegas. Can't wait to come back again. I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves good authentic Mexican food. You will not r disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the very worst burrito I've ever had this is absolutely nasty the Mexicans should sue this place because this is not Mexican food this is garbage just salty crap  a dog won't eat this"}
{"text":"We had the 12 piece taquitos... it was Friday after school, me and the kids thought that it would be the perfect food to end the hectic week! And it was! The food was delicious, the staff friendly and restaurant was clean! Would go back when craving some yummy carbs!!"}
{"text":"Just opened up and it's the same as all Roberto's... Since I am closer to this area it comes in handy when you don't have to drive far for a craving.... Like all Roberto's its open 24hrs."}
{"text":"So far this is probably the worst Roberto's we have been to. We gave it a second shot since the drive through is so convenient but alas they let us down again. The nachos every time we get them the cheese is not one little bit melted so we have to go home and melt it ourselves before we can eat. You only get a couple small things of salsa for 2 tacos and 2 nachos. The temp of the food is rather luke warm when it comes out as well. Other Roberto's we have been to have never had this type of thing happen and it's happened twice here. I would just travel to a different one and get a better meal."}
{"text":"If you could give no stars I would. The lady in the drive thru was extremely rude. First she tried to give me a bag with hot suace all over that outside of the bag. Then she doesn't give me a fork and continues to argue that it's in the bag. No fork. Would it be so hard to to just give me another fork. This lady is horrible she should be fired. Today's date 9/19/16 3pm"}
{"text":"This location made my nachos wrong and when I called to inform them they said even if I took back they would've make it right, they said they wouldn't even return my money.. I thought they could at least make me a new order. So I called corporate offices which gave me franchise owners number, he answered my phone call but said he thought I was lying and refused to help me to fix problem.. by this time I was pissed because I loved this restaurant so I tried calling corporate back, surely they would see to it that my order was corrected but sadly they said they can't control individual owners so they couldn't help me!!! They lost a customer forever now. The sad part is that i loved this chain of restaurants so I do miss them but when you get treated so poorly it's time to give your money to someone else."}
{"text":"I've been to many locations, but this is by far the cleanest. The staff is very friendly, and the food is excellent. I love their chile Colorado burrito. Very impressed and will be a regular customer. Added bonus that it's within walking distance of my home."}
{"text":"Worst experience with ever, never will I go back. My sister found blue greenish slim in her taco salad .Top it off we were pulling more and more out. The cashier had a attuide a guy which was eating his taquito while taking ar order cussed us out and said we can't have are money back. Ohh it was hell in there . The mom in he kitchen started talking shit In Spanish and I told them please In English but I told her in Spanish(Rude) she knew English. Lol..by far the worses restaurant ive had been to.They need to be shut down. Terrible Terrible Terrible.."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours and always consistent.  Machaca burrito, California burrito, and Carne Asada fries are my \"go-to\" dishes."}
{"text":"The cashier lady decide to charge me double on my food, because she claims it's her machine that was doing it. Then she says we ordered 2 drinks which we didn't. She is terrible and she stills owes me 1 dollar."}
{"text":"Roberto's is the first GOOD Mexican food place that's squeaky clean on the inside which made me really suspicious the first time I came. After all, we all know good Mexican food comes from health food inspection failed places. I'm from Los Angeles, but I can recommend this place with two thumbs up.  Everything on the menu is good, like most Mexican places, it's the same stuff packaged in different things-- tacos, burritos, nachos, enchiladas, the food is the same but you choose how you want it served. The one thing to know is that the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. My girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla because she 'wasnt hungry' and received a half pizza-like monstrosity of cheesy chicken-y goodness overload.  My personal favorite are the carne asada nachos (order them to-go- for bigger portions) at around $7.50 coupled with a large horchata ($2.50) and you've got yourself a meal. My brother likes the #6 with steak (enchilada and burrito combo) and loves the red sauce on the enchiladas. Make note that pictures on the walls are not correct because the portions aren't that small (all the better for my bro) so I'd say for most things, you could split it with another bulimic person.  A couple of things I'd like to note: - They're open 24 hours. - The sour cream there is really good. I swear it's mixed with crack so if you like sour cream, try ordering a side of it for $0.99. They'll give you a lot. - The guys there are really cool and speak relatively fluent English. - They take credit cards."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Spanish and go hear late at night your ordor will be wrong.. Has been the last 5 times I've gone. Even after having them repeat it back to me to make sure it's not..."}
{"text":"This is the best Roberto's I've been too!! Not sure what they do different too the green sause here but it's incredible!!"}
{"text":"My favorite day is 99 cent taco Wednesday's!!! Staff is so friendly and my order has never been wrong. Extra cheese please only green sauce and always correct. Unlike other Robertos!  Best one on my side of town"}
{"text":"Always friendly service & good tasting food! Lunch time is busy with construction/ landscaping workers, so the can be longer. Always an A grade showing with the health dept."}
{"text":"A perfect Place to Pick up or eat inside.. Great Tacos and Burritos and the Salsas so testy !!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Waited fir my order for 40 minutes, got home just to see the torta bread totally burned.  My kids food was cold and the rice must have been from last week. last time i ever buy food here."}
{"text":"fast food. had the bacon breakfast burrito, was ok. kinda bland. split it with the hubs and was perfect amount for both of us."}
{"text":"So I guess Robertos raised the prices on everything. Along with that I watched my food sit behind the counter for 8 minutes while it was just me and one other customer in the place while 4 employees ignored me."}
{"text":"Okay.. So It's Roberto's a.k.a. Regreto's.... You know you're whasted af.. stumbling into Roberto's because its the carpe diem of Mexican food after drinking, and definitely NOT Taco Bell. I give them 5 stars regardless if they got my order wrong, they did slightly over charge me for a bogus rolled taco deal, almost skimped me of my LARGE side of crema (sour cream) I ordered.. and had to ask them for  little sandwich bags so I can munch on jalapenos, and carrots while I waited for my order. WHO GIVES A F $%&!?. Your here because your drunk, its a weekend.. you're not working out tomorrow.. the hottie you were working all night at the club,  left with some other person that probably wasn't even close to being as hot as you... and all you can think about is wrapping your alcohol absorbed lips around some legit, lard made tortillas, some carne asada pappas, and an extra order of anything on the menu to bring home to gorge on in the afternoon while suffering from your hangover. I mean!?... come on! You're most likely to wake up a couple hours after your binge, and puking your 15 bucks of great Mexican fast food ANYWAY. This place not only deserves 5 stars, but 5 GOLD stars for sobering my a$$ up enough to get me home."}
{"text":"Moved from Vegas 7 yrs ago and this particular Roberto's is always my first stop when I'm visiting home.  The. Best. Chicken Tacos."}
{"text":"Ok I'm posting it here because it happened to be the closest one (and the one I just ate at) and I'm sick and tired of all this Roberto's is the sh*t sh*t!!! As you can see I'm not a fan at all.  First off let's talk about what they do right: the staff at every location I've been to is very friendly and professional. They are courteous and quick and I've always had them get my order right. The locations are invariably clean as well. Kudos for that.  The problem for me is the food. I am a damn good cook - I make damn good food - and I'm from Texas. All of my grandparents were from Mexico and since I've been eating this food all my life I feel like I'm pretty well qualified to comment on this. Mexican food done right is the best food in the world. Done wrong - well if you haven't seen the episode of South Park where the dead celebrities are haunting Ike (Kyle's little brother) and Billy Mays's undead spirit is hawking Chipotle-Away because it can get the blood stains shooting from your ass at high velocity out of your underwear from the burrito you ate earlier - well let's just hope you don't ever experience the Mexican Screaming Shits. It's not pretty. It's actually pretty damn ugly. And it smells bad. Nuff said. The food here is mediocre at best and I have found it's rarely at its best. I've tried a number of different items and each one is always greasy and covered in cheese. Now anyone who knows me knows my opinion on toppings, condiments and fillers. When they are the star of the meal, it's a sign of mediocre (at best) food. So why is everything on this menu loaded with it? Hmm...not a good omen but we'll see. I ordered a breakfast burrito here (sans cheese) and was less than impressed. Granted the sausage was ok - not great, not horrible, just kinda...meh. The burrito was hot and made to order, which is good. However, it was wrapped in a tortilla that felt like it had been slathered with lard and heated. How do you serve a greasy tortilla? REALLY?? Now I've eaten at Roberto's several times since I moved here - my friends have always said it's great drunk food and the first few times I went I was a bit drunk so I guess I must not have noticed. The last bunch of times I've gone though I've been sober and every time I just like it less and less. I just cannot ignore that the only thing I usually taste is the cheese (which is not good at all since I'm lactose intolerant) and I'm just really not a big fan of things tasting cheesy. I had the burrito without it and - guess what - it was mediocre. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just...meh. Nothing about it shone. I couldn't even taste the pico de gallo which it was supposed to have. Hell I can buy a better burrito at Carl's Jr! Thank you - but no. I don't think I'll be going back to Roberto's anymore unless I'm just desperate and can't find a Del Taco. It's really a shame, too. Oh Roberto's you had so much promise. Too bad you couldn't deliver."}
{"text":"If you order take out make sure you check your order before leaving. I called within 30 minutes of being there telling them stuff I paid for wasn't there. Because I ate my dinner with the mistakes she would do nothing about the extras I paid for and didn't get. It was late and I was starving and didn't want to wait for a correction. A simple partial refund of the extras I didn't get would have been fine but no. Never again Roberto's."}
{"text":"Man oh man oh man!  This place is good!  Open 24 hours!  The food really tastes like socal San Diego.  I ordered a number 11 (3 rolled tacos with rice and beans) and it was delicious!  I tried the green and red salsa and both were bomb!  Granny ordered a machaca burrito.  She said it was better than the normal place she goes to as they use tiny little strips of meat but Robertos meat was way better.  She saved me a lil piece and it was good.  Sis got carne asada burrito and i didn't hear any complaints so it must've been good! Definitely coming here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Roberto's I've ever been to this is my favorite. It makes for a convenient, low cost dinner when I don't feel like cooking. My 1yr old loves their rice and beans too"}
{"text":"A great local place, I went here for dinner one night and will be back, i had a great experience. The food was great, the service was friendly. Great for a quick stop in if you are in the area. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Worst location. Carne asada burrito and fries were cold. Tortilla was hard and cheese was not melted. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Over priced, cold cheese enchiladas, nachos had cold un-melted cheese, carne asada meat was just plain gross! Never again."}
{"text":"Súper rico, me sirvieron súper bien y el staff muy amigable!! SUPER YUMMY FOOD, ad the staff are so friendly, great customer service and food!!!!"}
{"text":"A classic. I hope this place never goes out of business."}
{"text":"I visited this location a couple of years ago for lunch and thought it was decent, but promptly forgot about it. Today I finally returned to give it another try. It's not the Mexican food you'd find somewhere like Texas, but for this area it is pretty decent.   The entrée portions are huge and the food is A-OK. I like the salsa bar to personalize your food. Today my husband and I had breakfast burritos. They were the largest burritos ever which I wasn't expecting for around $5 a burrito. The burrito was pretty good. It's definitely the best breakfast burrito option near my house. Our order came up quickly as well."}
{"text":"Overall this is a decent spot to grab a quick lunch.  The location is conveniently located in front of the outlet mall. The only negative to this is that parking can be tight at lunch time. The restaurant isn't huge, but there are plenty of tables inside and outside to accommodate busy times. I love that they have a few tables outside for us office folk that need some sunshine on a beautiful day.  The staff is really doing their best to get orders taken and prepared as quickly as possibly. The girl taking orders was quick, but all business since they are trying to get everyone through as quickly as possible. After placing my order I visited the salsa bar and my food was ready in less than five minutes.   On this particular day I opted for the chicken taco and chicken enchilada combination with rice and beans. I like that the shell on the chicken taco is fried. The enchilada had a good tasting sauce on top. The green and red salsa from the salsa bar were both tasty. It definitely hit the mark for my Mexican food craving. The plate had plenty of food and was a cheap lunch option."}
{"text":"Recently my visit at this location have declined and finally have decided to stop coming. All because of that one older guy's terrible attitude at the drive through window. We live across the street and have been coming to this place at least twice a week since they opened. My husband and I were here the other night around midnight and again late last night at 1am. We usually just brush off this old guy's bitterness, but two nights in the row was no longer ok. This location have made a couple of mistakes here and then but we didn't mind too much because they were honest mistakes. We have been coming here since they opened and usually have a smooth time. The other night, we ordered a Taco Salad with no meat nor beans (my usual) and a Machaca Burrito and two carrot bags. He rolled his eye and smirked. I didn't originally know what for but whatever, he can stay miserable as he wish. We got home and realized he only gave us one carrot bag. I guess that was what the eye rolling and smirk was for. We were also surprised to have receive a very burnt Taco Salad shell. I thought I'd try it out to see if it's still edible anyway and maybe I could save us some time to drive back, I didn't want to deal with the guy again to ask for a remake honestly. Too bad it was not edible and I really had to return it. So I drove back for a remake and asked the guy politely because I didn't want it to get even more difficult with him already having a terrible attitude. He refused to remake it and gave me a refund. That turned out to be a total waste of time on my end after all. Again, I brushed it off. The next night (last night) as if I haven't learned my lesson yet. I told my husband I wanted to go back and order it because I started to crave it. We pulled to the drive through, same guy asked for our order and I ordered it again: Taco Salad with no meat nor beans. Guess what happened this time, the guy started talking smack IN SPANISH saying we're back again. First of, EVEN IF YOU COVER THE MIC ON YOUR HEADSET, IT DONESNT MEAN IT MUTES IT. Second we are not Chinese like you said. YES WE DO UNDERSTAND SPANISH, maybe just a little BUT ENOUGH. These recent experience have made us decide to NEVER come back until that guy is replaced with someone more deserving of the job. We spend around $30 a week here and the store have just lost that extra sale. You have that guy to thank for."}
{"text":"I live on the east coast now and sometimes I barely find the Strength To Survive without good mexican food. I recently went to las vegas and I Believe roberto's is one of the best burritos i've had. When We Were Younger, we had a lot of good mexican food, but Everything Changes when you try roberto's. It's Not Too Late to try some! Tell Me you'll make your way to roberto's to try their california burrito or carne asada fries. Slow Down, because i'm Not Done Yet, this will be the best burrito you've ever had. Don't Worry, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent but the 50 cent transaction fee for credit card is ridiculous."}
{"text":"3rd strike and your out.  Todays order was to be steak and when I got back to my office it was chicken.   This is the last time I visit this location.  I normally dont have this problem at other locations."}
{"text":"After searching all kinds of food nearby, we came across this restaurant. Surprisingly, the food was amazing! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came here out of convenience and I'm kinda sorry that I didn't drive to the other location. Not that it's a huge deal but all I ordered was the 3 beef rolled tacos with no cheese and guacamole. The rollers were totally overdone and the guacamole is more of a dressing and doesn't seem like avocado at all. Not at all the quality of other locations. And all of the employees singing loud and chattering back and forth felt pretty rude."}
{"text":"This is your typical 24hour cheap Mexican food place.  The food is pretty delicious and the prices are not too bad. What I especially liked about this location is how clean it was!! Another awesome thing about this location is the fantastic service! My group was greeted upon coming in and the cashier was super friendly!   Thing I liked the best: Cucumber slices at the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Ghetto @ROBERTOSINVEGAS right off Twain & Swenson.  Same menu as every location,same food sadly. Myself I like Ground Beef to be like a seasoned maidrite not Shredded Pot Roast with NO flavoring.  TOO Greasy and bland for my tastes!!  I prefer Victors next door"}
{"text":"There are Robertos all around town, but this is the best place to go... Very clean, very courteous employees, very quick service.  Carne Asada Nachos will feed you for 2 days.... Seriously....  Chicken burritos are a little over 3 bucks and contain only.... Chicken! What a concept!  Will go back"}
{"text":"My husband is from Las Vegas so we go once a year to visit family. Of course while we're there we have to go to Roberto's. I always get the carne asada burrito with rice and beans and I have never been disappointed. When you think of Roberto's you always think hole in the wall and that's what it is a special little gem hidden away with bomb Mexican food. We are Roberto lovers for life. :) it's the perfect food after a night out on the strip. If your tipsy this is one of the places to go for sure!"}
{"text":"I like this place. its clean and food taste good. They have a really good cinnamon rice drink also!"}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect if you've eaten at a Roberto's before. It's located inside the Sam's Town Casino and it's open 24 hours which is very convenient so you can eat at any time of the day."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this robertos they screw up the order! The lady at the drive thru is rude!! this robertos sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Complete Garbage!!!!! It's Mexican food, how do you screw up the order so bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  Soda Fountain completely out of order, then they charge for a refill of watered down pineapple juice water.  Rolled tacos were soggy, with barely any cheese.  Chicken tacos needed to be held over the fryer for a few more seconds, total grease bombs."}
{"text":"This place has cheap Mexican. By 'cheap,' I mean in price and quality. They have pretty crappy sauces and use cheap yellow shredded cheese inside their dishes. The wait is long for what you get. It's just gross, who's writing these four star reviews?"}
{"text":"The chicken nachos are banging!! A ton of chicken. I don't even like mexican food so it's exceptional!"}
{"text":"best mexican food i've had in nevada. chicken tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Skip this location charge for debit card also.85 for Rice instead of potatoes owner has 3 location in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I was really glad when this place opened cuz it was really close to home and what makes it more enjoyable to order something and get it home quickly so it's not soggy or becomes lukewarm.  Well all the times I have ordered from this place I have been disappointed.  The only two times I was satisfied .....1-after drinking, 2-my friend ordered a special nacho for me and I was starving.    What disappoints me about this place (maybe it's just this one on Cactus) is the lack of flavor.  I should not have to add all kinds of sauce or feel like there is something lacking that I cannot put my finger on.   Specially for the carne asada.  It should have taste that excites the taste buds on your tongue.  But...no.    I've been to good taqueria and I do miss the one in California called Chavez in Hayward.    So time to search for a good place, hopefully not too far from home.  My son would rather eat TACO BELL, and me, too."}
{"text":"I love Robertos. Always stop for rolled tacos. That comes for eating them in San Diego way, way back. We stopped at Roberto's on Russell today. Very disappointed. The rolled tacos were okay. Had a tostada and shell  tasted burnt . The salsa was empty (both kinds) and not brought out until we were ready to leave. We told the girl behind the counter that the ice machine was not making ice and nothing was done.  The pop machine looked like it needed a good cleaning. The area around the condiments was messy and looked bad. We did not eat any condiments. We were going to order some other food to go when we left but the service and appearance of many things left a bad taste in our mouth. I will still go to Robertos but will not come back to this one again.  I come from Wa State for these tacos....have never had an issue before and hope not to again!"}
{"text":"I've loved Roberto's for years now! For breakfast it's a yummy breakfast burrito...or lunch carne asada burrito. I love the chips, cheese, and guac too for a snack. Cheese enchiladas, Shrimp Burrito, Nachos are THE BEST."}
{"text":"This location definitely has the sweetest ladies! Every time I go through the drive through they are amazing!!  And my horchata tastes like smarties ahah I love it"}
{"text":"Only place I got for carne asada nachos!"}
{"text":"At this time and when I'm buzzin, I'm usually craving a sausage buffet or some booty but at the moment, I actually wanted real food.   When I walked in at 2am they already knew wassup 'cause I was buzzin from Carlo Rossi wine and had the munchies. Cliche.  I got the Carne Asada Fries and it was on point as usual with an overabundance of protein. The service was alright, it's not like it matters when your head is throbbing and it's 2am.   This place is connected to a convenience store so if you wanna get fucked up even more, there ya go. They also have a drive-thru, the tables were clean, and the salsa station was well-equipped."}
{"text":"I came here to satisfy my depressed appetite (I recently broke up with my boyfriend who I thought was \"the one\" and we talked about getting married soon in Palm Springs..........and I came here for pick-me-up food). It's not that he's a bad person; it's just that I decided to cheat on him for my career.   I didn't feel guilty at all for consuming this fat mess! The Carne Asada fries were on point as usual and it brought up all my natural antidepressants to lift me from melancholy.  I highly recommend this place to those who just got dumped and feel like shit. Dr. Roberto will ease the pain. Haha."}
{"text":"Their chips were cold, old and stale. It was too tough to eat. The cashier couldn't even speak English. Not going to come here again."}
{"text":"While waiting for a friend's doctor appointment, we decided to grab a quick bite at Roberto's.  I've been to several locations in my time, but I have to say that this is the best looking.  The place was clean, the seats were new and the bathroom!  the bathroom was spotless, I only used 1 coat of antibacterial gel afterwards.  Which as it should be, since it appears that this particular location is having its grand opening.  Not much to say about food, other than we ate it and we didn't get sick. The prices are great and the service was speedy.  The consistency of Roberto's is pretty spot on, which is always  good to know you can expect the same thing at their other locations."}
{"text":"Their chicken tacos are the BEST! Stuffed full of shredded chicken... Three of those tacos with some of their red salsa - that's dinner! Be on the look out for their .99 cent tacos deals - that's the only way this food gets any better!"}
{"text":"My favorite Roberto's in Vegas. The 5 rolled tacos with everything and a drink is a great deal."}
{"text":"Awesome to finally have a Robertos on this side of shit Summerlin.   The downfall is the weekends, uber crowded, ordered 1 burrito and it took about 30 minutes.  Dining room was packed for people waiting on To go orders,  drive through was packed and people were coming in from the drive through inside asking where there orders were.  Long story short, good food, be prepared to wait.  I will count this as a new weekend, everyone wants to get some Robertos and a apartment community is next to it."}
{"text":"We just left this location and I'm so happy with the whole experience that I believe it worth writing a review. The person who took our order was really friendly and the place was really clean and well organized. Considering it's almost 4am I wasn't expecting a good service or a clean place, that's how all my previous Robertos experience were. Strongly recommend this location"}
{"text":"I get Roberto's pretty much once a week at this location. I love the food, and it pretty much always tastes great. Only issue is that I've had them give me the wrong order probably 4 times in the past, so now I have to check it before I leave. And like others have said, charging $1 for a little side of sour cream is ridiculous! But I'll keep coming because I love the food."}
{"text":"Wow. Total re-do/double-take Batman! This place has had a facelift and it's a very good facelift indeed. The last time I trekked to this Roberto's it was probably 4 or 5 years ago. I remember it being a kind of greasy taco shop in need of a major upgrade. Ya, the food was okay, and the place was... eh.  But I came here today for a torta and the shop is really nice. The tables are clean and the entire kitchen has been turned around. The employees are nice too and my food was served up quick. I was the only one there at the time.  I ordered a carne asada torta with everything. I enjoyed this torta. I felt as though it was well made, like they actually put thought into it. I have had so many tortas that I felt were just thrown together and the guac was dripping out the sides, the pico was all runny and gross. But not this torta! It helps that it was wrapped up very tightly in the waxy-paper and then the aluminum foil. Plus the bread was hefty. It wasn't a light bread. Therefore, even though the sandwich is juicy, the bread is holding up to it. I have had a lot of tortas when I got to the bottom I just tossed the damn thing because the bread was SO mushy and gross. Not this torta. The bread was only just a bit of mush, so I could eat it with no problem.  I didn't realize this Roberto's had had a little renaissance. Now that I know, I'll probably be back more than once every 4 years."}
{"text":"50/50 Robertos on Cheyenne & MLK!  Breakfast burritos are always good.  Tacos, burritos, rolled tacos in the evenings are sometimes cold.  They precook & freeze their carne asada, chicken, pork & such meats.  I have never seen one employee there actually cook raw meat. Its very strange for a Mex. Restaurant to actually not cook raw meats.    Employees just look at you w Zombie faces. Not just at night but every minute of the day & night.  They never smile at this establishment except to themselves.  I pretty much get that impression with most of the Robertos in town!  They are definently not happy nor friendly to their customers - all around.  Everyone is money per a body there & the orders in return is as bad as the service.  Thanks for hot sauce bar... it helps with favor.  No friendly customer service.  Zombies that think they are the only taco joint in town.  I only go to a Robertos if I'm desprate.  I put up half of that star cz bad customer service makes ordering out unpleasant."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas. Being from California I'm used to the real authentic flavors that places all over back home have & Roberto's provides that here. My favorite is the Asada Burrito, the meat is super flavorful & the burrito is the size of 2 at other joints. This is perfect for anytime of the day or night & with most open 24 hours Roberto's is always an option"}
{"text":"Went there only to be told that anything I ordered would be microwaved. They had just cleaned the grill and didnt want to get it dirty. They are a 24 hour business so exactly how long would they want to keep the grill clean? Will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Fresh and made to order!!! Loooove everything but especially the breakfast burrito!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. Great food and amazing staff. Even my picky husband loves their food."}
{"text":"My husband seems to eat at Roberto's on Decautur at least once a week. He usually orders the 5 taquitos and this time ordered the chili colorado. He said the meat was somewhat tough and overall lacked flavor. Luckily, he got a breakfast burrito for the morning so he had something else to eat. Maybe it's just this location with the not so great chili colorado. My father in law ordered the tortas and said they were great. They were so big, he got 3 meals out of it."}
{"text":"I lived in San Diego County a couple decades ago and Roberto's was a favorite place for fans of Mexican food.  The carne asada  burritos are good and not loaded with rice and beans.  The best Mexican in Reno."}
{"text":"Maybe I just expected a little more given I have heard how amazing the food is. Not so tonight. Enchiladas lacked flavor, sauce on it seemed watered down. Chile relleno  had a off taste and was even cold in the center. Chips were literally thrown on the plate out of the fryer. You could see the oil on the bottom of the plate."}
{"text":"These folks are fast! The food is good and you can be in and out before you know it. It's not in the best location but their speediness makes up for it .  It's the closest thing to San Diego Carne Asada Fries you can get without being there."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite place to grab a quick bite. My daughter love their carne asada fries and I love the rolled taco with guacamole and sour cream. I also enjoy the Horchatta, which is a Mexican rice drink.  The cashier is always friendly and so are the cooks."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location about 3 dozen times and I am always surprised that at the salsa bar its never clean. I've always got radishes or peppers in the hot sauce Baja Fresh keeps theirs clean I don't know if this is just this location or a nationwide problem but it's pretty annoying to know somebody else's slop is mixed into the hot sauce. Show a little pride in your work. The food itself is good"}
{"text":"This Roberto's is legit! Went  in 2 weeks ago at 1am, and the salsa bar was stocked and fresh! The green sauce is amazing!!! They also use chicken breast here too! The place was nice and clean and the cooks were friendly!!! I love me some rolled tacos with a side a rice! Lots of cucumbers and radishes too!"}
{"text":"Best Roberto's in Town, hands down! Chips and Guac, with 3 rolled chicken tacos, rice and beans is the way to go, all their food is great there. I take all my Cali friends there and any time I'm home, there for Viva Las Vegas or Punk Rock Bowling it's a great hangover meal, I love the OC but all the Roberto's here are in SD. The place is clean too! Staff is nice and the salsa bar is stocked with salsas, peppers, and even cucumbers!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get homesick for San Diego I come here for some comfort food ....So Cal style! I broke my rule of not eating after 5pm because I was craving  a Breakfast Burrito...and they are open 24 hours so I figured it was destiny . The burrito was just what I needed after a day filled with salad and berries. It was filled with potatoes, cheese, eggs and bacon. Soo good it's probably a gazillion calories....but I will not worry about that tonight."}
{"text":"Ok food. My soda had the wrong proportion of fizz to flavor, and the food was somewhat bland. Need more salsa options. Quesadilla was better than the tacos, which had very little meat in them."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a good experience. The tables weren't clean. There was a sign above the salsa station saying don't waste it, which seems pretty tacky to have a sign like that. The salsa was too hot and there was no less hot option. The worst part however was both of our meats were overcooked like it had been sitting up there for hours. I had carnitas, which was tough. We talked about how much better Chipotle is than this place. We eat at local Mexican restaurants in the Mission district of San Francisco and expected something similar."}
{"text":"They always get the order wrong. No matter how much I stress the particulars of my order. Just say a number and don't deviate from the menu. The food is bland.The place is a hot mess. Been there three times and always disappointed. I loved this place back in Sacramento. Here in Las Vegas...they are just slapping beans on a plate."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, where taco shops extend beyond the Roberto's chain, I found myself hopping from taco shop to taco shop after moving to Vegas, chasing the guacamole dragon.  I finally found this location, which has a friendly staff, is clean and reminds me most of the taco shops back home. Everything I've had here has been good and the price is reasonable.  I personally love the #11 -- 3 rolled tacos with rice and beans. On occasion, the beans can get kinda salty. Someone back there gets a little heavy handed with the cotija cheese (salty salty!), but I just throw more hot sauce on it and move on.  Two negatives: Their horchata isn't very cold. That may be traditional -- maybe I'm just a gringa used to icy cold horchata, but its not even served with ice. On one hand, I dig it because you get more horchata, on the other hand... it's warm horchata.  The other is that they don't offer chips and salsa.  Every single Roberto's I've been in, when i ask if we can get an order of chips and salsa with our to-go, has given me a look like, \"Que?\"  And then we end up with a stryofoam carton full of chips and pico de gallo.  The concepts seems to elude them. Maybe it's a SoCal thing.  But I drive out of my way to go to this location. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I go in for a light night grab after work, staff is always nice and friendly and I get my order with no problems, they have raised the prices but the raise is understandable given today's costs, I also love the sign in the lobby that explains this. Better to pay a bit more than have the place go under."}
{"text":"I usually really love Roberto's...but today I was so grossed out I couldn't even finish my food.   It was my first time trying this location and I should have known better when I immediately saw there were dirty tables as my husband and I walked in. The cashier seemed friendly though as we proceeded with our order.   As we waited, I went to the salsa bar to get my favorite pickled carrots. Well, it wasn't to my surprise that the salsa bar was also a mess. The vegetables weren't refilled, sauce everywhere and a dirty rag that sat nearby.  The tongs lay have dipped on top of the carrots and I was disgusted to think how many people may have touched those and how many times they probably fell into the sauce...I could not eat those after that. Not to mention there were red chili peppers in there in place of the jalapeños.   Finally our food was ready and I sat down to eat my carnitas burrito. It was really very soggy so I ended up picking at it with my fork. It wasn't until I told myself I'd take one more bite and be finished with it, that the last bite happened to be the taste of a brown avocado...ew, ew, ew.   I quickly had to flush it down with a soda and told my husband we don't need to come back here again. Of course after the bad experience I check on Yelp to see other peoples' bad reviews...  I hope we don't get sick tonight..."}
{"text":"Last time eating Roberto's. Over priced as fuck and they apparently give you ham in your machaca... smh"}
{"text":"The food was gross. Carne Assad nachos were soggy, the chip to topping ratio was way off.it needed way more chips. The said cream on my chimichanga melted so my chimichanga was swimming in melted sour cream. It looked and tasted nasty. The bean and cheese burrito was all tortilla, not enough bean and cheese. Stay far away!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  I've been to the one in Henderson and been very happy.  Today here for a chorizo and egg burrito and it was very good and consistent with the other store.  The food was hot, fresh and very good.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"They charged up twice for the same order and then yelled at me on the phone saying that because I didn't have my recite on me it wasn't there problem and hung up on me"}
{"text":"Not all of the Roberto locations are the same, each location though they have the same menu, the food can be drastically different.  I have been to this location many times and is by far my favorite! There are two locations closer to me, I drive past them to go to this one.  My favs... Carne Asada Nacho!!! Loaded with everything wonderful! Carne Asada Burrito. Want to make it better? Get the burrito enchilada style!! Delicious!!! The breakfast burrito is excellent as well.  I prefer to get it to go... the location is a little icky... booths aren't cleaned as often as they should be. Thats why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5.  But the food is really good."}
{"text":"great mexican fast food place.  open 24hrs.  multiple locations all over vegas.  cheap and with large portions.  id recommend their carnitas plate, breakfast burritos and carniasada fries."}
{"text":"I have no idea how anyone can think Faustos is better than this place. First it is super clean the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the have Jamaica! But let's go over some things here the Carne is super tasty and at 5.95 a really good deal for the portion. Both sauces are tasty but u enjoy the green sauce a bit more than the red the beans and rice had prefect seasoning and I loved the open layout and big windows it gives such a bright feeling in the building. Also not to do with food but the music isn't super loud or filed with static which was pleasant. If you want the lower los angelos feel and some really good food at a decent price where you can sit with the family I highly recommend Robertos any day of the week."}
{"text":"These people messed up my order then when I showed the receipt that stated they put cheese and sour cream on the order they still would not replace   Also the red sauce has a tinge of sewer water taste to it   Avoid this place give your money to someone else who see quality food even it it costs you the extra dollar"}
{"text":"I have family out in Vegas..And its a MUST to stop by when we come into, In the middle of our stay, and right before we leave. Carne asada fries are the shit! The shrimp Burrito is pretty gnarly too.."}
{"text":"When I work early in the morning I call in breakfast burritos for myself I and some coworkers and I called and order and paid to have sour cream added on 3 when I got them none of them had sour cream when I called to order next time I explained that I paid for 3 to have sour cream and bob did that I was going to order 3 more but to make sure they had it she told me I will charge only one because of what happen last time I said how if your charged me for 3 and 3 didn't have any and today I'm ordering 3 and should be be free she started arguing so I said keep your chump change I'm fighting with you for less then a dollar but I guess I will be finding a new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This is how you do tacos in Vegas!  And the horchata drink was the perfect sweetness to the taco and enchilada."}
{"text":"Okay, first things first: it's open 24 hours.  We were looking for somewhere - anywhere - that was open after we checked in at midnight.  The burritos are huge - guacamole included - and tasty.  And they take debit/credit, so that rocks.  Should've got extra salsa though..."}
{"text":"Good, not great. The quality/taste is about the  same as other similar taco shops.....one gripe is that there is a door that connects them to the bar/casino next door, which allows smoke to get in the \"dining\" room."}
{"text":"We were leaving town in the am hours wanting breakfast on the road, the usual fast food options we're not sounding very appetizing. I found Roberto's on yelp and stopped in. We ordered their breakfast burritos which were amazing and huge, we could have split one! The service was fast and very friendly!"}
{"text":"if i could give this place 0 stars i would. their employees are dishonest and rude. the 1am crew tried to charge me $9.00 for a regular burrito that says $6.95 on the menu. tried to refuse giving me my money back after i noticed the overcharge. and then proceeded to scream \"fuck you\" in my face after i made him give me my money back.  mind you no receipt was given for any of this. Who cares if you have a drive thru, your employees are rude and steal!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel silly reviewing a chain, however, this location is delicious. The restaurant itself could use a touch up though. Maybe its because every time I've been in there its just after a dinner rush, but about 3 times in a row every table is dirty and the place is a little messy. The staff is kind though, and the food is always consistent. I will always return!"}
{"text":"Decent enough food but the place was filthy. Floor was sticky and it's not like they were busy. It might have been after a rush but it's a bad look when there's trash everywhere and workers are just standing around talking. Food took quite a while but wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Have lived in Texas for 5 years and sure miss Roberto's from when I lived in San Diego. We were traveling through Boulder City on our way to the west coast and saw Roberto's listed. Couldn't wait to get there and we weren't disappointed. Great food at a very low price. I had rolled tacos with guacamole plus rice and beans. Delicious! My husband had a chicken burrito that was sooooo full of chicken. Definitely a bargain price and great food. This is not a fancy restaurant but they do have seating. Looking for a good fast food Mexican meal?  This is the place!"}
{"text":"The chili relleno was amazing and there tacos were full of meat!!! The service was amazing and the facility was clean and beautiful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was the last Friday in Lent and I'd made a late night run to get a burger for myself and then fish tacos from here for my husband. I also went ahead and picked up an order of cheese enchiladas and loaded Nachos. While my husband said the Tacos were pretty decent, everything else was disappointing. When did every Mexican restaurant decide that it was ok to serve Cheese that hasn't been melted?? It's seriously infuriating and turning me off to Mexican food entirely. Why would I want Nachos or enchiladas with cold shredded cheese?? In the case of the Nachos, they are no longer loaded Nachos - it's just a Nacho salad. Fail. Who will right this wrong?!?"}
{"text":"Not very pleased with this Roberto's location.  They don't offer sausage here and the potatoes were undercooked in the burrito I ordered.  It was basically like eating little rocks.  :(  I am unlikely to go here again (except to get my money back for today's order).  It isn't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Wednesday chicken taco night is one my slight indulgences, lately. I would say with 99 cent chicken tacos, you can't go wrong, but with this place, it can be hit and miss. The shells can be super oily and can quite literally soak through the wrapping and even the bag before I get home, which is 3 minutes down the road. Two tacos does just fine for me. The other dish I like is the #8, the machaca (shredded beef with egg.) nom nom!"}
{"text":"The best things about this place is that the food is fast and the service is kind.   The food is DECENT at best. It's food, it's not bad, but it's definitely not authentic.  Shredded cheddar cheese in the main ingredient in this establishment. It's topped on everything, placed in everything. And usually stays like that. Cold.  In both my enchilada and my friends quesadilla the cheese was not melted completely. Still chunks of cold cheese.   You can tell almost of their products are packaged or canned, with the exception of the salsa bar. They make the pickled veggies and salsas. The chips are relatively fresh, not stale. This is a good place to go if it's late and you need something quick... just heat it up when you get home"}
{"text":"Not happy at all with the food.  I have eaten 99 cent  chicken tacos from this location for over a year.  This time I noticed a HUGE difference,  especially when compared to the location off sunset and mountain Vista.  My tacos were not satisfying to say the least.  What LITTLE chicken that was used in my tacos was over cooked.  It seemed like they substituted a head of lettuce to make the taco look full.  I don't take kindly to restaurants cutting corners to save a buck.  If you want to save on your precious chicken cause your losing money,  take away the .99 chicken taco Wednesdays!  I won't be back as it's obvious I wasn't important enough to give me the chicken taco advertised on the window and picture menus!"}
{"text":"The food here was Southern California style Mexican food which I was very happy about. I had shredded beef tacos and carne asada fries. Both tasted good but the shell on the shredded beef tacos was so hard it made it tough to eat, the meat was very flavorful though. The carne asada could have used more marinade or seasoning but when you mixed it with all of the other toppings on the fries it was really good. I enjoyed the red salsa too!"}
{"text":"Worst service no one speaks english and charged for items i never got when asked about it i was called a lier.  The condiments were all open to kids hands and not even chilled the radfishes are watm and salza had floating things in it.  This place was at one time good now the worst service in all of vegas!!!!!  Sams town needs to pull there lease and get a real resturant in here. I speak from exp on this i have tried several times before writing this review.  Also there is no money back if thay mes it up only an offer of new more meased up food   STAY AWAY !!!!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Roberto's in the Valley. I've tried several gas station versions of Roberto's and none compare to this one. I am a regular here, at least 2-3 times a week because it's located down Rampart near my place.   The food here is EXCELLENT. I usually order the chicken burrito combo which comes with rice, beans, and a drink...FOR 5.50 (Best deal EVER) !!! The burrito itself is between .75-1 lb of fresh peeled chicken with peppers and onions (always add queso fresco $0.95). Love it. Probably the closest to homestyle quick mexican you will ever get. Also notable are the rolled tacos and carne asada plate. Truthfully, the prices are what got me in and the taste keeps me coming back. The salsa bar with marinated veggies are totally worth a sixth star.  Service is quick, accurate, and on-point.   The atmosphere here is more of a \"sit-in\" style compared to the gas station versions while maintaining a fast food ambiance.  I recommend THIS Roberto's to everyone far and near. Great value, big portions, and gigantic taste...There's no reason to pass this place up."}
{"text":"Great food, and good prices.  The inside was pretty standard taco shop kinda place. The food is good. I ordered a carne asada burrito plate and was quite pleased with what I got. Keep in mind that the burritos sold here don't come with rice or beans inside, you have to order the plate. Also, it is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Meh.... There really isn't anything special about Oscar's Mexican Food stall. It has authentic Mexican fast food. Not super cheap like it is in California. It's a little outdoor type joint where you order outside and take it with you (or sit on the little chairs and tables around the gas station).  I seem to order the same thing whenever I go which is a breakfast burrito hold the meat with sour cream added. Despite the fact I have them take out the meat, they still charge me at least a $1 extra for the sour cream. \"No substitutions.\" The potatoes are ALWAYS hard and uncooked. Don't know why I keep ordering this burrito. I have tried it for the last time and won't be getting it again. Sigh.  Tried the fish burrito and it was a fried type of fish, like a fish stick. Ug. I've had seriously KICK BUTT burritos in SoCal and wonder if I will ever find a replacement for the nicely seasoned soft grilled fish they use in theirs.   The bean and cheese burrito is a good bargain for $2.50.   Their rice is good.   Portions are pretty good. Not too big.  There is not any other way to order the food except for stand in line outside the gas station while all the people walk past you, in and out of the doors to the shop.   I guess this is sort of a desperation type of Mexican place for me since there is such a limited amount of places to eat in the area.   Wahoo Fish Burrito (right around the corner) is a lot better and more flavorful."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, cheap prices, and 24 hours!  What's not to like?   Nothing!  I often come here after work, and am working my way trying their awesome variety of burritos.  The 3 rolled tacos are always good.  The real stars in my book, are the breakfast burritos!  I don't think I can say enough about the breakfast burritos.  They are life changing, I don't know if it is even worth trying another breakfast burrito to compare.    The restaurant is always clean, the food is prepared quickly and the food is AMAZING!  I can't say I've been to all the Roberto's but this one has always been a great go to place."}
{"text":"I like Roberto's for a long time but now I won't be going back because of their political views"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Roberto's, especially to grab a late night meal. Roberto's was always the go to spot for the infamous carne asada fries, but I'm sorry to say that you have officially lost a life long customer due to just sheer greed. $10 for carne asada fries!!!?? As well as 7 something for a burrito!!?? Ridiculous. You guys raised your prices by like 20% lol. Gonna go to another restaurant that charges fair prices."}
{"text":"Always fast and delicioso! Very clean, from the dining room to the restroom. Love the salsa bar that is always stocked with complimentary fresh cucumbers and spicy carrots. Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Came in at 4:00AM with my boyfriend. Although language was a slight barrier, our order was accurate, made in a timely manner and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I must say, the carne asada fries are very tasty. However, the customer service here is not so great. My job is right around the corner, so I eat here at least once a week. There's been many instances when they've gotten my order wrong one way or another and the thing that bothers me is that they don't even apologize for it. Customer service is definitely lacking and considering the fact that I'm a loyal customer, I really expect more from them, which is why I knocked down 3 stars. If the customer service isn't good, it really makes you think about whether or not you want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This particular Roberto's is like a beacon of light among a sea of ticky-tacky track homes.  It's conveniently tucked away in at the corner of Cactus and Bermuda.  Since it sits in a low traffic area, it's never super busy like others.   It has a drive thru located at the end of a mini strip mall.  I love Roberto's food and they are always generous with their portions.  My favorites are the unbelieveably savory rolled beef tacos (always with Guacamole and cheese), fish tacos, carne asada chimichangas, carnitas nachos and even chips with guacamole and cheese.  The drive thru is open 24 hours, so it's probably the best and cheapest after-gambling or clubbing food around!  As a frequent visitor to Vegas, sometimes you start to hate/dread the strip and just want something cheap (why not?) simple and fast ...you get all this and so much more!!!  PS... OK, I'll share a funny story regarding the rolled tacos... I ordered them through the drive thru and was so hungry, I couldn't wait to get home and started eating them in the car.  I had no idea I was dripping sauce, guacamole and cheese on myself.  Before I got home, I had to stop off at a drugstore to pick up a few things.  I distinctly remember the guy at the checkout having a funny look on his face and never really making eye contact with me.  I just brushed it off and hurried back in the car when I saw my reflection on the store glass - my shirt looked like an art canvas of green, orange and red!! I can't imagine what the checker thought... maybe one too many martinis... Geez...at that point I just laughed and cleaned myself up!"}
{"text":"Roberto's on Boulder is very good 'cheap' food.  For those of you that have never been to a Roberto's, don't expect dim lighting and fresh flowers...it's a fast-food Mexican joint for Pete's sake! :)   I don't recommend being in a rush if going through the drive-thru...it should really be classified as \"semi-fast food\"...lol. Tacos+rice+beans= snoopy dance by me."}
{"text":"Very very good Mexican food!  We are snobby Soouthern Californians when it comes to Mexican food, but this place was delicious and cheap!  Got a carne asada burrito and man, it was stuffed full of meat.  The meat was also very flavorful and fresh!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tacos are great the burritos are ok. Carne asada and carnitas are tasty. I haven't tried anything else yet but being open 24hours and close by means I will be trying something else soon! but anything taste good when your drunk."}
{"text":"We were excited to go here since some friends had recommended it. It wasn't nearly as good as they were saying. We got a bean and cheese burrito and the breakfast burrito. Both were really bland and the breakfast burrito was $9...seemed over priced. Probably won't be returning here. The food wasn't bad but it was unimpressive overall. If you're looking for good Mexican, taco y taco is WAY better."}
{"text":"Love this location (and you can see from my activity that I enjoy my Roberto's)! The food is always well prepared, fast, and fresh. It's in a kinda sorta strip mall next to a sweets shop and behind the 7 eleven by unlv. Never crowded (even on taco Wednesday), and always seems to be the same four guys working. Whatever, they know their stuff and the food definitely shows it."}
{"text":"I recently heard the expression \"sex on a plate\" as someone described a meal. Now I know what they mean!  After reading up on the reviews of this place, I decided I was missing out. I WAS! I had a beef enchilada and a cheese enchilada to go. I don't know what kinda cheese they use but there was plenty on each one. The beef is marinated so well. Their enchilada sauce is just so BOMB! My roommate got a carne asada burrito and said it was excellent. So I will definitely go back.   Only downside here is a little pricey, but honestly it's worth it."}
{"text":"Tired of ordering shredded beef burritos stuffed full of onions, peppers and tomatoes! Where's the BEEF? I've eaten at Robertos many times and have always been happy, but this drive-thru location really skimps on their meat!!"}
{"text":"The best mexican food in the area. So yummy! It's always fresh and they are really respectful of details if you need to edit ingredients used, for dietary reasons. I love this location!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far and I have to say that both times, the food was incredible.  I am huge fan of Roberto's in general but for some reason, my experience at this location has been amazing.  Both times I ordered via drive thru & both times the food was fresh.  It wasn't as greasy as some of the other locations I've been to.  I hope they keep up the good work here.  I love the location and I love the fact that I can walk here from my house."}
{"text":"I often come to Vegas to visit my family and we were just looking for somewhere quick to eat. This place was pretty good! I'm from Southern California where the Mexican food is near authentic. I had the enchiladas and the chicken was lean. My dad had the fish tacos and he didn't have any complaints. It's pretty clean and so is the bathroom. Not to mention they have a complete salsa bar. I'd come here again if I was in the neighborhood looking for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from food establishments, especially Roberto's, but the customer service there was GOD AWFUL. The workers looked like they wanted to die and the lady(?) taking orders had the WORST attitude, not to mention she gave my family a smug look the whole time we were there! Her face alone almost made me lose my appetite so we had to take it to-go instead. The reason I say \"lady\" with a question mark is because I wasn't sure what their gender was.. If you ever go to this location you won't miss him/her. He/She has a big mole on his/her face.      .. Other than that, the food was whatever. I'd recommend Taco Bell instead. Or another Roberto's location."}
{"text":"Food here has never been a problem. I can get a to go order, and it takes at most 10 minutes to get my food. Only thing I can say that prevents the 5 would be the lack of a smile. Maybe the workers just don't like me in particular :/  All in all, food is great. Particular fan of all the burrito choices. Always hot and fresh with a nice grilled taste."}
{"text":"If I could give a -negative score I would  SUPER greasy!! Chips and tacos literally SITTING AND DRIPPING in grease YUCK!!  I specifically asked about shredded meat saying I DON'T eat shredded meat then my tacos had shredded beef YUCK. The sauce was horrible! She didn't even 'offer' to replace the order.  The tables were dirty, chairs were broken. I WILL NEVER go back!! I DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT Recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"It might not seem like a compliment to compare one Roberto's to another.. But anyone who is honest and dines out knows, it's never the same in two spots.  I love Roberto's. I am picky about guacamole, preparation, sauces, carrots, and jalapenos. Here all is covered. You won't be disappointed my the delicious carne asada that can overwhelm a togo box to capacity if you order fries or nachos.. The cheese quesadilla is always my go to. I adore how big the flour tortilla is, and that somehow they have the perfect mixture of different cheeses that it always melts in my mouth. I wouldn't eat anywhere else when it comes to the way I believe mexican food to taste.  Just my opinion, but then again, I don't frequent anywhere else when it comes to fast, delicious mexican."}
{"text":"The cleanest/best Robertos in town"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's and this happens to be right by my house so I come here all the time. The food always comes out fast and they always get my order right.  This location is old and the decor is dumpy ...but I don't go to Robertos for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Roberto's is such a perfect place to get delicious and quality Mexican food! The staff at this restaurant is so welcoming and the food tastes phenomenal and fills you up! I highly recommend this Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch especially 99cent chicken taco Wednesday great food never a long wait too"}
{"text":"My foods always delicious and I love this place! The green salsa is addicting. Also Wednesday nights are .99 chicken taco night and that's my go-to food. The staff is nice and they keep it clean. It gets really crowded come dinner time though!"}
{"text":"There is really an insane amount of Roberto's Taco Shops in the Vegas area but for how good this one was, despite being adjoined to a gas station I can see why. Robertos managaes to capture the taste of a local taqueria and propagate it for mass convenience. It's the sort of delicious, greasy, and abundant meal that makes taquerias the ultimate comfort food to me.  FYI the tacos are a little ridiculous. But in a good way. They're huge and have a ton of guac on them. My recc: Al pastor all day baby"}
{"text":"Drive-Thru!!  I love this location, I can get my greasy mexican food grub on as well as pump gas and buy junk food.  The food is just like any other Roberto's Taco Shop which is wonderfully greasy, cheesy, and delicious.  Great hangover food."}
{"text":"Fast, clean, cheap and chicken taco Wednesdays! I love this place."}
{"text":"Drove up to Speaker Box and spoke very clearly and slowly I wanted 7 Chicken Taco's with **Mild Sauce & a bag of Cucumbers \" ... with my order.  Two Cars a head of me only.  When I got to the window I had to wait 5 - 8 minutes and then when I got home \" no Mild Sauce & no Cucumbers \".  Never leave here without checking your orders 1st.  (And any complaints ... there is a phone number at the pick-up window to call when your not a happy camper.)   I wouldn't call this place  \" Fast Food \" either.  You'll have to wait more than U would at a Jack-In-The-Box for sure. And yes, as another person indicated pre-made at times.  Previously got the Chicken Taco's on the Wednesday's Special for .99 cents and it was obvious when I got home the were not fresh \"Hot Made\", they were Ice Cold from being pre-made refrigerated .... Order \" Fresh Hot \" ."}
{"text":"Large portions, good value. Some locations are cleaner than others but about what you'd expect for each neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the REAL DEAL Roberto's that originated in SoCal in the 70's. My Mom and Aunt confirmed it when they recognized the owner after getting their infamous Rolled Tacos with Guac and Cheese on a whim during their last visit.  I'm not kidding when I say it instantly brought us all back to our High School days and the midnight after-party Roberto's trips. I'd been a little hesitant to go there since I often recall my original Roberto's visits in my daydreams, the smell of fresh tortillas the and wonderful carne asada on the grill... it was almost as if I didn't want to cheat on them... But now that I know IT IS them, bring on the Horchata and spicy carrots!!! I will rep this little taco shop forever as if it were my own."}
{"text":"Too sad that I've moved away from Roberto's Taco Shop territory. I lived just around the block from this location and hunger pangs were usually cured by Roberto's. I only ever really get one or two things from here when I go, but consistency is what I liked! The meat in the burritos are a little tough sometimes or overcooked, so I hardly get those but Roberto's is my go-to for carne asada fries. Extra cheese and ask for some jalapenos before I drive off and I'm good to go. Best carne asada fries I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"This Roberto's sucks compared to other locations. They charge ridiculous amounts extra for everything. If you want a carne asada burrito twice the size of this location go to the location on flamingo and rainbow. This is the last time I try this location. Bad attitudes and smaller portions is what you will find here."}
{"text":"Ok so first time hitting up this robertos the red sauce so far is the best from all the robertos ... And the taqitoes are good...now this is the bad part ... I order a tamale ....ive ate plenty of tamales in my day ... And i habe to say this is the worst god dam sorry excuse for a tamale ive ever seen and tasted in my life ... It was beyond shameful and pathetic !!! The whole thing was soggy yet burnt to hell at the same time ... Was quite a disappointment...thats why i only give this spot a 2 rating the tamale killed it very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"... this is the worst robertos ive ever been too in my life ... the guy behind the counter was actimg really stange like he was on drugs ... then scans my card ... then he looked confused ... and acted as though my card didnt go though and gave me food ... then he started talkin shit in spanish like a fuck ...head ... not obly was this guy acting lile a tweeker ... but the food here really sucked ass ... then to add the embarassment  of him makin me look bad lile i didnt have money on my card when i have well more then enough ... what it all boils down to is this is one shitty ass robertos ... dont go to it ... the cashier  is a noron fuck face !!!"}
{"text":"Shitest fuckin robertos they always fuck up order theresvplenty of other robertos to go ro ...trust me go to another one"}
{"text":"Their beans taste just like they should. Hard shell tacos, So good! Nachos are plentiful. It's your neighborhood taco shop what more could you ask for. Call your order in ahead, avoid the wait. \"Who wants tacos?!\""}
{"text":"ROBERTOS. I don't know where I would be without this 24 hour joint!   Depending on the location you go to, the cleanliness varies. This location is VERY CLEAN & maintained.   My usual order consists of chile rellano, shrimp burrito & sometimes a cheese quesadilla. (Late night cravings FTW!)   The chile rellano, I think is an acquired taste. It's very cheesy & saucy inside of a pepper, but it's delicious. Try with a side of horchata if \"spice is life\" isn't your life motto.   The shrimp burrito is HUGE. It usually takes 2 people to finish it up, unless you have an appetite & in that case, this is still probably the only thing you'd need to order to feel satisfied.   The cheese quesadilla is extremely cheesy & not to mention super greasy. *order with caution*   Bottomline: If you are craving some decent food, even at late hours of the night, where you get a bang for your buck -- you might want to try this."}
{"text":"They always are friendly and patient with me...I'm the type of person who stands there for 5 mins saying hmm an ummm an shesh what should I get...plus I love the condiment station...I pack a ziploc full if those carrots and peppers oh so yummy for my tummy!!!plus they have great deals on mondays they have 1.99 breakfast burritos...Wednesdays they have 1.99 chicken tacos seriously I could eat here all week...then again my body wouldn't be happy with all the working out I would need to do...thank you Roberto's for feeding me such delicious food ^_-"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here at 2am today.  Short story: Got charged for 3 large horchatas and received 2 smalls. No receipt. Awful service.  Got off work late and decided to grab a quick bite for me and a friend, ordered Carne Asada fries and a carne asada burrito, with a large horchata. Pulled up to the window, cashier says it's $34. I say \"no way, I only got fries and a burrito, and horchata\" she said \"no you ordered 3 fries, 3 burrito.\" After telling her I didn't order that she takes my money. Gives me my food with no receipt. My friend then decides she wants an horchata as well, since there was literally nobody in the store or in the drive thru line, I ask if I can add another large horchata. She takes my $20. Charges me for 2 large horchatas (even though I already paid for 1 large), hands me my drinks and I drive off. After I leave the parking lot I see that the 2 drinks were actually smalls! Which means I paid for 3 large horchatas and received 2 smalls. My friend noticed her putting bills into the tip jar behind the window, so we're pretty sure she used what was supposed to be my change as a tip FOR HER AWFUL SERVICE. Horrible service experience. A language barrier is one thing, but this wasn't a miscommunication just really bad service."}
{"text":"This one on Sunset and Pecos is fantastic!!! Friendly service, happy employees and food is great!!! Came here from California and I am hooked on this place!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Roberto's to my office and it's fairly similar to every other Roberto's in town. It's not the nicest one in terms of decor, but I doubt you go to Roberto's for the interior decorating. The menu and pricing are exactly the same as every Roberto's in Vegas. The one thing to note is that there is no bathroom available to customers. For a dine in restaurant, that's quite odd. You may need to wash your hands before eating, but you won't be able to here. And considering this is Mexican food, you may need to hit up the bathroom immediately after eating, but you won't be able to here."}
{"text":"This is the Roberto's closest to the office, so I'm here about once a week. The cashier knows my usual (carne asade burrito special) and is surprised when, on rare occasions, I order anything else.  At the end of the day, it's like any other Roberto's in Las Vegas. Convenient. Cheap. Delicious."}
{"text":"its edible, that's it, taco bellish, had better food from a roach coach"}
{"text":"Horrible ! That's what I have to say I went there on January 9, 2016 ordered 5 rolled tacos sour cream to the side no guacamole yes cheese and Pico got home started eating my rolled tacos and bit into a chunk of metal I was like no way so I went to take another bite and there was another chunk of metal that's gross so I call the restaurant and the guy says oh so what you want me to make you more I said no i would like my money back he oh no I can't do that I said is there a manager he said huh and hung up and then didn't answer so I will not be back that's gross !!!!"}
{"text":"The California Burrito is to die for, especially with a side of guacamole to slather on top. I will seriously dream about this burrito when I'm back in Utah and unable to get it. Plus, it's dirt cheap. It's by far my new favorite burrito."}
{"text":"Man how disappointed I was with quality of food with this Roberto's Taco Shop . Generally I love Roberto's especially the one closest to my house off Gibson. But I decided to try the one closest by my work which happen to be the Rancho dr one..   This is the second time I have tried the food at this location and was let down twice .. Normally I love the Wednesday taco deal , but the tacos at this location were a big let down . I went during the  lunch hour rush, both times and it seems like they maybe a little under staffed . Because the food I got was cold and I noticed that the had a canister full of pre cooked tacos .. I ignore this, but when  I go to eat my tacos they just fall apart because they are cold and hard ..   I Know it's not easy to keep up with the rush hour for lunch .. But I think the food should be cooked upon ordering .. Not pre-made food that I received..    Sorry but twice is enough for me not to return to this location .."}
{"text":"How absurd that they charge $1 to run your card, I didn't charge you gas money to come to your restaurant. Furthermore your overpriced and under portioned.   Was a big fan. That is no longer the case"}
{"text":"Oh man this place was not what I expected. The meat lacked flavor and they were big hard chunks in tacos!!! Their portions are big but without the right flavor and quality meats it's no good. The prices were a bit high and I feel like I completely wasted my money. It's not authentic Mexican food, it's very Americanized."}
{"text":"Me and the bf's to go place for a late night hunger. Lol out of all roberto's location we tried, this is the one we like because they are generous in giving meat and everything else (specifically speaking for carne asada fries and carne asada burrito)   Staff: They're ok. Friendly but not too approachable. Doesnt smile lol but its ok for me(maybe they're tired or sleepy) coz we always go there like around 10pm literally only for a late night craving/hunger so understood if they dont want or not able to smile...   Place: no complaints... We dont eat at their dining room coz we always take our food to go.  Food: big portion for the price. Sometimes they forget to put beans on my burrito tho!!!! Lol  All in all, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"If it was up to me I would give not even a star but unfortunately I have to. This is not the first time that I've had an issue with my order less than a week ago I had to drive back myself back to that location and deal with the cashier I would guesstimate he's in his 20s very disrespectful and it's like a total toe issue. I am a pain customer I'm not here to measure who is better / harder. If I order my food and it supposed to come with certain sides I shouldn't have to drive back or make phone calls to make sure my order is correct. If you ever happen to have to go to the spot please make sure that everything is in the bag I promise you this place is worse then a McDonald's drive-through... I am definitely going back just to complain to the manager myself to try to if it resolves the issue I'm not saying that they're intoxicated on some sort of methamphetamine but I would not be surprised... Please do yourself a favor and go to a different one and if you have to go to this certain establishment do yourself a favor and pull everything out in front of that kid so they can see how bad they messed the order is up constantly."}
{"text":"Ate here w/ 3 family members & we all loved it!  We tried the daily special - it was chicken tacos, at extremely reasonable price. We added sides of refrained beans & rice to share. Their salsa bar includes several salsas + pickled veggies. A great lunch at very reasonable price.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Lets see where to start.... I just moved from Inglewood, CA to LAS this past week.  First mexican spot to hit. Boy was i even wrong to consider this mexican. To start of the guac? aint even guac. Its disgusting; no taste, no flavor, and just plain dull. I ordered the taquitos which i got 3 which are also flavorless. Trust me if anyone knows mexican food its me. NOW IF UR MEXICAN u know the one thing every mexican place gotta have good is tacos n taquitos ohh n menudo lol! I prob wont be back here again. I payed 8 bucks for this and 1.75 for xtra guac in the side. Btw i love guac. Guac is everything. Its not even guac. its blended guac.. yeah u know that kind of guac that is americanized. Save ur money and dont eat here. I should have gone to popeyes instead. Im not stereotyping but this place has no SWAG in food. I gave this 2 stars just because their fast."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of times very late at night. The food was very good as was the service. They have a nice little area set up for salsa,  radishes,  limes, etc. All I had was the tacos but they are good enough to come back for. Late at night the tables were dirty, I got my food to go."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for 6 years now and I keep hearing about Roberto's. You gotta try it. They are so good! Good food choices in this part of Henderson are limited and we're trying to find new stuff to eat so Roberto's finally got a visit.   After ordering taquitos and a chicken taco and chicken enchilada combo, a couple of things come to mind. If you want greasy food say after a long night of drinking, this will work. But if you're not overly intoxicated, this is a shrine to grease that is best avoided. And it's not hard to cook chicken. It's a fail safe food choice for me when trying someplace new as even with teenagers in the kitchen it's hard to mess up. But the taco and enchilada here had all the appeal of post surgery hospital food. Bland, boring, dry, and depressing. Waiting 30 minutes at the Taco Bell drive thru for corporate fast food would be preferable to Roberto's and it didn't make me reach for the bottle of pepto 30 minutes after eating it.   For a local chain that's been in business for 50 years, now I understand why they are open 24 hours. It has to be that the late night after bar crowd keeps this place afloat. I'll give them 1 star but they won't get our repeat business."}
{"text":"Best Robertos location in town! Most Robertos location are crap, but this one makes everything perfect. They have pollo Asada which most locations don't have"}
{"text":"First, this place is located in a gas station.  Not that it makes it bad.  In fact, it makes it more appealing to me.  Unfortunately the food was just meh.  The shredded beef had very little flavor to it.  The enchilada sauce also needed some spice.  I guess if I was drunk off my rocker I might want everything on the menu.  Being sober, on a Saturday around 1pm, this place definitely needed some help."}
{"text":"Very very mediocre. Nothing memorable. I am shocked it gets 4 stars it should just get a solid 3.  I had the nachos and the carnitas. Bathrooms are not too clean but at least the service was nice"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times, but I don't normally seek out Roberto's since I rarely visit Mexican fast food joints and if I do, I prefer Faustos. My recent visit was based on convenience and I thought I'd give it a whirl again to compare.   I have been on an Al Pastor kick for the last couple months, so I immediately began searching for my favorite pork. Since I couldn't find it on the menu, I saw \"marinated pork\" and asked to verify. When I asked the cashier if they offered Al Pastor, she responded, \"Yes\" and directed me to the Adobada. So, I ordered an Adobada burrito for myself and Adobada Nachos to share with my friend.  As it turns out, Al Pastor and Adobada are NOT the same thing. Al Pastor is pork marinated in dried chiles, spices and pineapple, then roasted on the vertical spit. Adobada is generally pork marinated in a \"red\" chilli sauce with vinegar and oregano. Adobada can refer to any type of marinated pork, so people can technically claim it is the same as Al Pastor, however, the vinegar in Adoba sauce and preparation of Al Pastor makes a big difference in flavor.   Who knows if Faustos serves real Al Pastor when it could just be Adobada (the possible absence of the vertical spit)? Either way, Roberto's Adobada does taste different from other Al Pastor I've had in town. I concluded it was not different in a bad way, but rather just good in its own way. The flavor was great! I really enjoyed it with the nachos (I think I may prefer their nachos to Faustos, slightly). The burrito was good as well, but I was surprised that it was accompanied by just pico de gallo and guacamole. However, I don't order burritos often, so this may well be the norm. Their tortilla was yummy and I loved the crust they put on it from the flattop.   My verdict is that Roberto's is good in its own way in comparison to Faustos. I like Al Pastor slightly more than Adobada, so that may be the deciding factor of where I choose to go. Oh, I did enjoy the salsa bar here much better because of the additional fresh vegetable choices!"}
{"text":"I've lived over here for 5 years now and this Roberto's has always always always been good!!  Especially the Carne Asada Fries!! And there's been many days where I crave a simple Bean & Cheese burrito....and every single time it's been great!  It's been hit & miss at other Roberto's in town but this location has been good every time!!!  Ooh ya....almost forgot....the Shrimp Burrito rocks too!!!"}
{"text":"Our drive thru order was missing items. Missing the sour cream we ordered and order of rice. We paid for the items but they weren't in the bag. Also, no utensils and minimal condiments.   The carne asada taco meat was dry and the salsa on top had too much onion. I was picking it off. I can do some onions but not that much. The carnita taco had good flavor though but was lukewarm.   Just make sure to check your bag whenever you order from this place to make sure they didn't forget anything. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Excellent storefront mexican very close to Nellis AFB main gate."}
{"text":"Food was cold and they took 20 minutes to make. I ordered a burrito which was priced at 5.65. After tax i checked my statement and they charged my card 10$! I guess the workers think they can add their own personal tips. Very dishonest workers. Pay cash and double check what they are charging you if you are going to come here. PS Not sure what i just ate but looked like a fingernail and pubes. I did not know they had pubes and fingernails on menu. Maybe that's why they over charged me??"}
{"text":"Perfect food for the late night grubs! 3am after a club or a bar..and you just wanna have a good time and need somethin to fill up those alcoholic tummies, this is the joint yo!   Ok so I haven't gone here late night yet, but i assume it would be perfection. Burritos are awesome and cheap. They melt in your mouth and leak onto your lips and faces. I really like carne asada and adobada burritos. They're both under 5 bucks. Tacos are too cheesy for me but if you're a cheesy type of gal or guy, check it out.   Typical looking slightly larger mexican restaurant. The service at night was horrible. I stood in front of this mexican chick at the register for at least 10 seconds before she noticed i was standing in front of her. Then she looked at me and was like..'what?'  GIRL I WILL SLAP YOU! some atrocious service at the time. other days that i have gone it was not that bad, but beware for the beezies who hate their job.   food is good..forget all the other things i said :)."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and average tasting food.  You will need to use the condiments to give the food any flavors."}
{"text":"The service was great, he was patient as it was my first time there I ended up playing it safe and getting deep fried chicken tacos!...AMAZIIIIING!"}
{"text":"The taco was cold and too hard to chew. Service was lousy. The dining room was dirty and I had to eat at a dirty table with trash still on it."}
{"text":"Food portions/quality, service, prices, and overall experience have become horrible. I used to love this location.  The sneaky little credit card 50 cent fee put me over the top. 4 of the last 5 visits have been lousy. I will go to real Mexican sit-down places and pay the same prices for a better experience."}
{"text":"Very clean, very friendly staff.   We tried combos #2 (bean tostada, cheese enchilada) and #11 (3 rolled tacos - chicken). Preferred #2 - the tostada had lots of lettuce and cheese and the enchilada sauce was very good. The rolled tacos were good but a bit dry and not as filling but loved the chicken was white meat. You will be full as the combos come with beans and rice - I didn't find either particularly wonderful, but good. Wish I could visit again to try other things (tacos, specials) as I don't think I would strongly recommend either combo we ordered. Loved the salsa bar (red and green sauces) with sliced radishes, cucumbers, green onion stalks, and hot peppers/carrots."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for five years now and have eaten regularly at almost all the Roberto taco shops around town, and never have I once ever given them a complaint until now especially having to do with this location on Harmon. At first it kind of pissed me off that I had to go back out to my car to get my wallet and pay cash, cause if you want use your credit card at this location no matter what the total is they want to charge you a flat rate of $1. That is totally absurd to me.  Also their salsa bar was a complete mess...  there were cucumbers in the hot sauce, carrots in the green sauce,  jalapenos and onions in different places than what they should have been, and there was only 2 customers in the restaurant. They were not that busy so I'm sure the guy behind the counter who stood there playing on his phone probably could have cleaned up the hot sauce bar.  Also, while I was waiting for my food I noticed a sign by the hot sauce bar that said please only take what you need so we can keep our prices low. I thought that was pretty funny seeing how they're ripping off every single customer who uses their credit card by a $1"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Robertos, Robertos are doing a great job keeping it real Mexican food \"Best carne asada fries in town\" OP"}
{"text":"This Roberto's Taco Shop is my favorite one in Las Vegas. They're very professional, the restaurant is spotless, and the food was fresh. I wish I took a picture of the condiments. Carne Asada Quesadilla."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The staff does not like Gringos. They did not speak English. It was a horrible experience. The woman at the registrar did not even speak to  me other than no. All she knew was NO. She just stared at me with a crap face. She was disgustingly rude.  Every time I asked her if they have something told me no. And that's all she said. Later on if they did when I Astor she said no. But it was on the wall. Don't waste your time on this rat hole."}
{"text":"The food isn't as good as the other shops they have.  The place is a bit dirty and it's next to a gas station.  A lot of weird people come through this place."}
{"text":"In the almost-3 years I've lived in Las Vegas, I've seen new Roberto's locations pop up all over the place.  One thing to remember is that many of the stores are owned by different people, and the quality and menu definitely vary from store to store.  For some reason, the green salsa at this place is WAY hotter than it is at the other locations I've been too.  Huh.  This Roberto's is the closest to where I live, and it has always been pretty good.  The carne asada is so-so, the breakfast burritos are okay, but I've found that the carnitas here are better than other Roberto's locations.  When you order the carnitas they quickly fry them to a crisp right before putting them in the burrito or taco.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"My favorite Roberto's in town. It's very clean and the employees are very polite. My favorite is the carnitas plate aka #10. Very juicy and tender. The classics are very good too like carne asada fries/nachos and burritos are great too!!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I go to this place a lot. Me and my son go tonight to eat. I order 2 bean and cheese burritos, and carne asada fries with half the sour cream on the fries and half of the sour cream on the side. She makes a big deal about the sour cream thing. I said whatever ur normal portion is just cut it in half. Half here and half there. So I get my food she doesn't listen there's no sour cream on the fries. So I talk to the cook he's like ok give it to me and I'll put some on the fries. She makes a face and rolls her eyes. Whatever I'm thinking it's the way I want it. So me and my son start to eat, and my bran and cheese burrito is freezing cold not even the tortilla is hot. So I take it back and say my burrito is ice cold please make another one. I even told her feel the other side of u don't believe me. She doesn't of course just rolls the eyes again, and throws it away. So now I'm getting irritated, and I call the number they have posted on the counter. He calls me back, and ask to speak to the lady. She rejects to speak to her own boss.  So he's like I'll call the store. He calls the store I sit down, and eat with my son. He calls me back and says that she says I'm problematic everyone I go there. REALLY???  Why because she can't follow instructions on the sour cream ??? I'm like ok when I get home before I write this review I'm gonna call or text him to see if there is someone higher that I can talk 2. He says no, and that I'm the only customer who called today, and that I'm lying about my burrito being cold. ? Really I'm gonna lie about my burrito being cold, and if I was lying why would I tell her to feel it??? I wish I can post the pic. Of the text he sent me. Don't give robertos ur money! Please save ur self the headache and give ur money to a better Mexican restaurant or at least one who will not call u a liar, and take care of the issues."}
{"text":"Great service! I always come here and Every time I ask for something extra they never complain, always the best service."}
{"text":"The late night cook/cashier don't even know how to make a machaca burrito..He was so lazy, He just put the shredded beef and wrap it with tortilla WTF."}
{"text":"Love carne Asada fries,but when the fries are darn near burnt,it just ruins them.bo quality control when the over cook something."}
{"text":"Had the tacos here a couple of times during my stay in Vegas. The location is super convenient to base. The tacos aren't the best in Vegas but they are pretty damned good. The service was nice and the lady even remembered me a couple days later, probably had something to do with the white boy ordering tongue. I would definitely give this place or any o their locations a chance if your hungry for some good authentic Mexican grub."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place since moving here, and I've passed by these restaurants everywhere I go in Vegas. I had their chimichanga plate, and it did not disappoint. The chimi's tortilla was fried in something delicious.  Haven't tried anything else yet, but will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bwahahahaha seems like I'm the rare soul who ventures here sober at 3am. Nuff said, there should be one on every street corner. If Baja Fresh is Bill Cosby, Roberto's is Samuel L. Muthafuckin' Jackson."}
{"text":"They serve good burritos. It is tasty and it comes with the regular condiments of peppers, carrots, that have been in vinegar. It's good. Nothing to rave about but they make their food well."}
{"text":"I've always come here to grab a quick bean and cheese burrito on my lunch break. Typically never a problem. Today however, half way through my burrito and I'm chewing on some piece of shredded plastic? Let's get it and keep it together Roberto's. I'd like to still come and eat here."}
{"text":"Wow. It doesn't matter what time of day or night, you can come here and get amazing mexamerican food, made to order. The staff is always friendly, and they always get the order right. Best late-night stop, if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Robertos! Carne asada plate is the bomb! And their homemade flour tortillas... they are huge and so fresh!! Yum. the BEST thing about this location is that they have a drive thru! I remember back in the day when most robertos were in gas stations and you had to walk in. So glad they're having success and have their own individual locations. I wish more had drive thrus."}
{"text":"My friend and I order carne asada fries from here about once a week, if not, once every other week. ALWAYS specify extra crispy. It's NEVER extra crispy. Keep coming back because of convenience of location but it's getting frustrating now and willing to go out the way for a location that pays attention to detail."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong about this... The food is decent. I've had better from places like El Patio Mexico etc. My boyfriend and I also made a comment that we feel the need to get a Hepatitis test after eating here.  My main issues with this place are: A) Dirty dirty dirty. I should have checked around inside before I ordered. B) Soda machine only worked half the time we were there C) You do not need to drown everything in guacamole. Guac should ALWAYS be on the side... not the main ingredient in a torta or yucking up half the nachos.  D) Please get some staff that understand English. Blahblah, I understand this place is a Mexican fast food joint, but when I have to repeat myself a half dozen times to get the order right, only to find guac on everything despite me saying NO to it, I do get rather annoyed.   If they fixed these few things up, they'd be a really great place. Until then, there are much better Mexican joints around."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hrs the place is super clean and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to a Roberto's on Durango and Warm Springs, ordered a bean and cheese burrito which came to $3.08 with tax...I paid with my debit card with no issue and left a tip.   I came to this Roberto's across from UNLV,  ordered the same bean and cheese burrito, total came to $3.08 and was told if my order is less than $5 they'll charge me a $1 fee to use my debit card. That really annoyed me, how petty. I ended up adding two chicken tacos (that I didn't want) to my order to get it up to the $5 because I refuse to pay a fee to use my debit card. I gave the two tacos to a bum sitting outside of the front door.  Needless to say, they did not get a tip."}
{"text":"Éste Roberto 's siempre ha sido uno de mis favoritos, pero hoy me sacó de onda. Lo único que note fue un nuevo cocinero, Mi torta de Milanésa estuvo terrible, y mis churros que los ordene de cajeta, estaban mal cocinados y no eran de cajeta, la orden fue para llevar así que me fregué. Solo espero que esto no pase de nuevo, de verdad."}
{"text":"The worst robertos in town. Quality is horrible and different from all other locations. Salsa is not homemade and taste like it came from a can from New York City. New York City??? Avoid this location."}
{"text":"I went in for a group order for the guys at work. Maria helped me with my order and she was very attentive in ensuring my order was correct. She was very nice and asked for any additional things I might need. Muy amable!"}
{"text":"Ate at a different Roberto's location a few months ago and got carne asada fries. The fries were good, but the meat was not... it tasted a bit old, or as if it was microwaved. I decided to give the establishment a second try and got the chicken burrito which was less than $3. Not good at all either. I'm not sure what it is about the food but it just doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! I'm from Jersey and these are the best tortillas I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"Not every Roberto's has chicken asada but this one does. Best chicken asada french fries! Good for sharing."}
{"text":"We are regulars. We nick named it Beto's. We just say to each other should we stop by Beto's for dinner and everyone knows we are talking about Roberto's Tacos ....LoL The team there is great!"}
{"text":"In a town full of  posh and expensive restaurants, back to basics Mexican food at Roberto's is alright wit me. The food is consistently fresh and yummy. Best of all they have a Yummalicious Breakfast burrito! I have been searching all of Vegas for the best breakfast burrito and think I have found it. It has eggs, potatoes, pico de gallo, and perfectly crispy bacon (or carne asada) or whatever else you want inside. Just the perfect size for a hangover!"}
{"text":"I come to Roberto's because I feel like it has the best quality food over restaurant competitors such as don tortaco or Fausto's. This is the last time I step foot in there, halfway through my food I found a guys black hair in my food. I felt like throwing up after, I called to speak to a manager. There are no managers available at night time, worst location yet."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience from this place! Friendly staff, and generally good food with big portions! You gotta try the carne asada fries! Such a big portion and they are not shy about putting carne asada. it definetly hit that carne asada craving I had!"}
{"text":"Best chimichangas I've ever had. Only reason I'd move back to Vegas, the interior is alright and its best if you get your food to go. The portioning is ridiculously large and the best price around for the food you are getting. Be advised this is greasy food so if your health conscious avoid it. For really good tacos and the best chimichangas though, go here"}
{"text":"I normally would get the carne asada fries and add salsa verde and limes to it. Today I go the adabada fries as something different. They are not listed on the menu so you'll have to remember them in order to get them. They are hands down the best fries I've had in a very long time. The meat is so flavorful and really does go well with the other toppings you get. For less than $10 you can get literally two meals worth of enjoyment! I will definitely try these again."}
{"text":"Was at work and needed some quick breakfast. Coworker suggested breakfast burritos from here. I ordered a carne asada burrito. The burrito itself was huge. Definitely will fill you up. However I was a little disappointed with the meat. There didn't seem to be any flavor in the meat and therefore the burrito was bland. I did use salsa which helped slightly but still very little flavor. Next time I guess I will have to put guacamole or pico inside."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this location. Restaurant that neat and clean. Service was extremely fast and my food was made fresh to order. I ordered a California burrito with a side of chips and guacamole. I have never had either from Robertos. The burrito wasn't bad. There was a lot of excess tortilla that I ended up ripping off. Would recommend either using a smaller tortilla or at a little more filling given the burrito was fairly small for the price. The chips and guacamole were a little different then other restaurants I've ordered from. I received a to go box filled with chips that were already topped with guacamole. I was expecting a cup filled with guac as it was a to go order. Don't get me wrong it was good but made it very hard to eat given the guac was more runny then traditional guacamole that I was used to. Also, the bottom chips didn't have anything on them. They were lonely :(. Overall it was an ok experience and filled my Mexican food craving for awhile."}
{"text":"I have ate Robertos, I don't know how many times. But this, this was the BEST! The carne asada fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Love Robertos taco shop. Been going for several years. This location was pretty decent.  I called in ahead of time to order carne asada fries with everything. They said it will take about 5-10 minutes so by the time I left my friends house it should be ready.  When I arrived I said I called earlier. Food was ready. Saw them prepare it fresh off their grill. They added their yummy crispy fries, carne asada and other goodies.   On the side I grabbed a couple lemons and green salsa.   Great location and my carne asada fries tasted great!"}
{"text":"Service here is alright. I love their carne asada fries or California burrito. Food doesn't take that long too make depending how busy they are. They have lots of variety of Mexican style food. Prices are decent and they are open 24 hours a day. I always have a good portion of food every time I order and it's worth every buck. It is also clean here and offer fresh side bars."}
{"text":"I no longer live where there's a Roberto's. Saddest day! Best late night taco shop! I love the wet bean burrito, carne asada tacos, California burrito, chicken tacos, and carne asada nachos. Really good red salsa . Anytime I'm traveling where there's a Roberto's, I'm sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Love this place and the salsa bar...yummy!  Throw back to Oakland, CA mexican food trucks!!  Low prices...excellent food!  The place wasn't very clean (floors, tables, etc.) At 2:30am.....when I arrived there was a full table of 4 giggling women, a couple and one guy.  After I ordered...I swear...the club rush followed me in...the line was almost out the door...which means the 4 guys running the restaurant were getting slammed and hadn't had an opportunity to clean up during a break.  So, I'll look past it especially at that time of morning with drunk folks dropping food etc.  Excellent food!!  I had the $4.45 cheese quesdilla w rice and beans."}
{"text":"I don't know. It's cheap, it's not bad.. I think I'm ruined for any sort of authentic Mexican food, as I prefer Taco Bell to this place. Maybe it's my undying hatred of cilantro? I don't know, but I've eaten at Roberto's a few different times and still don't think it's great."}
{"text":"I ordered the number 8 and a beef taco. The girl that I placed the order with was nice, but the food had barely any taste. I am not saying it is bad, just not my taste I guess. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"I've tried the tacos de Lengua and California burrito with no veggies and they were both amazing. This place also has a drive thru."}
{"text":"Worst Robertos I have been to.. we waited over 20 min for our tacos and had we not went up to ask we would of waited longer.. I also asked if I could get a refill on my horchata and she proceeded to charge me.. She never even apologized for making us wait so long.. We took the baby and she got very irritable.. Never coming here again.."}
{"text":"A 24hour Mexican place??? A 24hour Mexican place that sells CARNE ASADA FRIES AND CALIFORNIA BURRITOS???? if there were 6 stars, it would get that.  I actually went on a trip to vegas w/ some buddies (one being the guy who first reviewed this place - LJ B.)   We actually went to this place twice, once being drunk and once sober, and both times it was absolutely amazing.  The meat at Roberto's is delicious.  There aren't a lot of people there at 2am so wouldn't know about the crowd. I ordered a California Burrito both nights. My buddies ordered the Carne Asada fries and all of us really enjoyed it.  When my buddy, LJ B. went to vegas w/ his family, i actually asked him to bring me back some Roberto's. That's how good it was."}
{"text":"Great for a late night snack when the wifey is hangry!!! We had the carne asada tacos for a quick late night snack. I did like the actual tortilla's the meat however was not as flavorful. I got the salsa verde and the spicy sauce. They were spicy but not very flavorful. I guess next time I end up here, I will have to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"I never physically eat inside, I always do the drive-thru.    We love their food. I always get the #14. If you LOVE Chili Relleno, then order that. My husband loves the chicken rolled tacos.   It's better than many places as far as Mexican fast food goes."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I can't judge nor comment on anyone elses review, however I will advise anyone thinking of eating at this paticular location to get your food to go.  There are constanly people around this location that look suspicious.   The trash bins and bathrooms were or perhaps still are filled with graffiti.  I had the $0.99 chicken tacos, and they were atrocious. They mask some horrible food with cheap prices. If you go to the location on Durango, the tacos taste fresh and crunchy not stale and flavorless.  My friend ended up getting a carne asada burrito and was on point so maybe the next time I come in the food will be better and the restaurant will look cleaner.  The staff was pretty much on point but that can't compensate for bad food. I speak fluent spanish so communication is not a problem.  Maybe next time Roberto."}
{"text":"On the naughty list  I can't really express myself here the full extent.  What I will tell you is that the tacos are over $2.00 each, they taste better at Pepes Tacos.  The location is horrible there are always people panhandling, or wanting to sell you something while you are trying to eat.   The staff is really slow, they don't pay attention to orders. I asked for one thing they gave me another.   They over charged me and didn't give a proper refund.   Overall the inside looks dirty, just like the one on Easter Ave.  The owner if Roberto Robledo, who is the owner of the Eastern, Durango, and a few more, So far the only location I can recommend is Warm Springs and Durango."}
{"text":"Second worst Roberto's Taco Shop in town.  I wasn't even able to order because they don't accept credit cards.   On top of that the locations is very hidden and the inside is very dirty looking and small.   The staff was just unsure of what to do being that I had already ordered. They charge a crazy fee for debit card transactions.   Stay away..."}
{"text":"This place does CARNITAS right. We got their large Horchata, carnitas taco, carnitas burrito and their carne asada fries and it was amaaaaaazing. Didn't try a single thing that I didn't fall in love with almost immediately. Fries were freshly made, the sauces they had on the side were amazing, everything about our meal was on point if not perfection. Will definitely be coming back here as much as I can while I'm in the area and I recommend anyone to do the same."}
{"text":"I live by the Roberto's at 1101 Fort Apache, but I like to go to this one because their food is much tastier. They also get your order right the first time. I like salsa and the salsa at this Roberto's is exceptional. The red sauce has a smoky flavor that is delicious - it's spicy but not too spicy. The green salsa is the best I've had here in Las Vegas. Compared to the Roberto's near my house, there is no comparison. My husband usually gets the beef chimichanga and I get the rolled tacos. Our daughter gets enchiladas. All are very good. They also have a salsa bar with fresh lemons and limes."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. I've been to plenty Robertos, but this one takes the cake. None of the sodas had any carbonation, hell scratch that, none of the the drink dispense fully worked. This place over all is fucking nasty, don't know if it was the crew that day or just the management. I'm glad the Robertos closer to where I live have better quality than this shit hole."}
{"text":"Not as good as Hualapai and DI. Asked to clean and chop up green onion for burrito. They just threw the green onions in without taking off bad parts or chopping them up. Carne aside burrito sort of soupy and not nearly as well done as we have been accustomed too. People nice but English not that great. Flour tortillas kind of hard. Hot sauce a bit off too."}
{"text":"I think they changed vegitables vendor! The green onions were huge and cilantro was like they just picked it. We have a certain way we like it made, best custom Carne asada burrito they've made us. Great job today..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. The fact that it is open 24 hours is convenient for those late night cravings. The burritos are a great value for the price and quantity. They come huge and loaded. They do offer smaller items but a variety that will keep food lovers happy! This is just a walk up window area but does have some out dooor seating area. Mostly recommended for in the go."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and I must say I am impressed. It of course is your usual Robertos, but the way it is set up gives it a nice modern touch. Ambience is not too bright but not too dark. Service was quick and on point. Went around 8pm on a Friday night. I hear that it does get packed too, but our experience had a steady fast flow service. They even have a drive thru! Its great to have but not sure if I would trust it on s busy night especially on a big order. Restaraunt is clean and i love how the salad bar is arranged. Everything is opened out and just seems to flow accordingly.  Always great and good to know when you have more locations/options to go to. I am sure i will be back to check this place out again."}
{"text":"A pretty reliable Roberto's located in a gas station and with a drive thru.  I recently came here while strapped for cash and being hungry after work.  I got the carne asada burrito for $6 and some change. It had guacamole and pico de gallo in it. As usual per this location, the meat  was seasoned well, and was still pretty tender. I guess I got lucky with a recently cooked batch of meat. The guacamole and pico tasted fresh and had good flavor to it as well. All three ingredients combined made for a good tasting and filling burrito.  Once again, I was given red and green sauce when I only ever ask for green. Whatever, not the end of the world. But pickled onions, carrots,  and jalapenos were put in my bag without having to ask, which was cool.  Another experience of decent tasting Mexican food that was filling and didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Supposedly open 24hrs but when we showed up at 1 am after a night of drinking the place was closed. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!"}
{"text":"What's all the hype about this place? This place sucks, I just don't understand how this place stays in business? it has to be some kind of money laundering business, who else would serve food like this? It's pretty disgusting. Flavorless tacos that are way out of line on price, nope never again, you'll never get my business again. The cashier thought I should be serving him,"}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN food ever tasted!!!! omg so inexpensive and so DELICIOUS!!!! U must hit up any Roberto's when you visit Vegas, I am dead serious! They open 24 hrs so you MUST eat here after a drunk night.  Believe me every dish on the menu will give you a food orgasam.  Mmmm.... i miss Roberto's."}
{"text":"2nd time I have been to this location and the food is great!!! The shop itself is tucked in by the Home Depot, I highly recommend trying this Robertos next time you are in the area. I  will be back to this one every tom I need a tool from Home Depot"}
{"text":"I've always hated Roberto's, but now that it's the closest Mexican option, I've found a few dishes I love. Service at this location is great, and it is a much nicer Roberto's than others I've visited. The same guy seems to be working 24 hours a day, and he never forgets my order.  I'm addicted to the three rolled tacos with guacamole, bean tostadas, and enchiladas. The only problem I ever have is that they sometimes give me beef rolled tacos when I request chicken, but it's not really a big deal for me. Otherwise, I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"So, I live like  a minute from this place and the food is good but the service is well not that good. The people who work there don't understand English that well so it's hard to tell them what you want at times. So many times my family and I have been overcharged or not given things that we've paid for. I will still go there, I just wish they would hire people with better customer service skills. I have called in to place orders there and they haven't understood what I was saying."}
{"text":"ok so everytime i go to this chain i always regret it afterwards. Of course i ignored my experience and went for my desire. After you eat there you feel like you just inhaled an elephant. And for the life of me I have no idea why but whenever i eat here I get projectile diarrhea...in fact i went to robertos one time and I had to use the bathroom before i ate and i walked into the most disgusting bathroom i have ever seen..he evidently had just had a meal there. That was enough to keep me from ordering at all. From now on I think i will just pass on this chain its obviously not the best food nor does it agree with me."}
{"text":"If you've lived or gone to school in San Diego, seeing a Bertos is a welcome sign for sure. Yes it's greasy and nasty but that's what sort of gives it than endearing quality that has kept me coming back for over 30 years. The carne asada is often tried but never duplicated (in LA anyway). Best of all is my Uber driver took me through the drive through (yes I offered her a burrito.. her loss.)"}
{"text":"Simple Fast & Delicious! Rolled Tacos & California Burrito Yes & Yes!!! Burrito is BIG!!!! Rolled Tacos \"taquitos\" topped with sour creame & Guacamole oh heaven"}
{"text":"Love this location, staff always ready to help and quick services. Clean restaurant and bathrooms"}
{"text":"Was on my way to a friends house and stopped to grab some dinner.  This location is newer and very nice. Food was actually better than most of the Roberto's around vegas.  I did have to wait quite a bit  longer for my food than I wanted."}
{"text":"Right off the freeway in a strip mall.. place was clean   I ordered the carne asada burrito .. it comes with guacamole and pico de gallo.. the tortilla was crunchy .. left to long on the flattop .. but tasty.  The green salsa was good, the cucumber was randomly chopped up but fresh, the green onions were raw .. I've never seen them served raw before..   Menudo is served on weekends"}
{"text":"They are all over Las Vegas and are always great for fresh cook to order Mexican Food. Honestly I only order the 2 beef taco plate with rice and beans. The quality is always consistent and good."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this is definitely my favorite fast Mexican food in Las Vegas. Roberto's Taco Shop always make my favorite food just the way I like it.   This location is right beside Smith's on Sunset. Not sure how long this location has been here, but the inside was very clean and was one of the nicest and newest looking Roberto's that I've been to.   I ordered the #5 which is a Beef Burrito & Cheese enchilada combination plate which cost $9.30. I asked for the burrito to be just bean and cheese and they were more than accommodating to make it for me. They still charge the same for just a bean and cheese as they do the beef burrito. My food came out quickly and was delicious. Everything was well seasoned, even the refried beans and the Spanish rice.   The employees were very friendly and smiled a lot. They made sure everyone's order was correct and was more than happy to correct something when it wasn't what someone ordered. They made sure to keep the salsa bar filled and clean. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are any negative reviews for Roberto's. I guess it's all a personal preference and what people order. My experience has almost always been a positive one, especially with the food.   This location is very convenient and the couple of times I've been here it has been clean and organized and the employees are always helpful and friendly. They make sure to keep the salsa bar full and clean as well.   My favorite items here are the bean and cheese burrito, cheese enchiladas, chicken tacos and the Carne Asada Fries. Everything has always been made just like I like it. It's fresh and well seasoned. The food is always hot. If you want something taken out or added to an item you order, they have always been very helpful with it.   Wednesday they offer $1 chicken tacos. Limit 12 per customer.   Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Love Roberto's and the food that they offer!   This location is just a few minutes from my place so it's super convenient for me to just stop in and get a quick dinner when I'm feeling like Mexican food.   I come in a lot of time on Wednesday for their $1.29 chicken tacos. Which are a must try item if you love chicken tacos. The chicken is super moist and full of flavor. And unlike many places that do taco day, Roberto's is very consistent. Their tacos on taco day are as big and filled as they are on any other day. Sometimes I feel like they actually are bigger than on any other day of the week.  Another of my favorite is the bean and cheese burrito combo (#5 which I ask for the burrito to be made just bean and cheese, no meat). This is something I actually have to specially order as they don't have it on their menu and they are always accommodating when I order this. They do charge the same as if you were getting the actual #5.   The employees here are super friendly. Never have had any bad experiences with them or my order.   Restaurant is clean and organized and everything at the salsa bar is filled and kept clean."}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada fries and the burritos are always amazing too. The California burrito is a favorite. (;"}
{"text":"For the price, for the speed of service, for the cleanliness and general efficiency, as a new resident to Las Vegas coming from Miami I couldn't be more happy with Robertos!!! Long time visitors to Henderson we always found Faustos to be the area's best taco shop. Actuality, no, I think it's Robertos! We moved in across the street and stumbled into this place and love it. As a food service professional its clear to me the product is made fresh and made to order. The chimichanga among other things is amazing. Very good quality, fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"One dollar to use a credit card after ordering 9 dollars of food. No other Robertos in Las Vegas charges that. So if you are visiting Las Vegas don't go to this place. Ripping of people. Okay it's January 30th and I see they no longer have a credit card charge so I change my rating to 5 stars. Food is good people are nice."}
{"text":"I must say for a chain this place is bomb! I have not been disappointed once and that's hard to do honestly! The staff here are so friendly! I love coming here and not being rushed to get my order in. They smile answer any questions that I have about their menu and do it with a smile.   Keep in mind this review is only for this location. I don't know how friendly other locations are, but this one is awesome! Parking is good never have a problem there. They have tons of seating so you won't have a problem finding somewhere to sit if you dine in.   To the food.... Oh man!!! The chicken enchiladas are so so good!! They pack it full of chicken too! I hate when I order from other places and I get tortilla with sauce basically. You won't have to worry about that here. If you get a taco craving this place is the place to go late at night especially you know when you cannot get that craving out of your head! Their chicken tacos.... Ohhhweee so so good! You have to try one you won't regret it!!   Overall probably my favorite place to come get some tacos without costing me an arm an a leg."}
{"text":"I love this place every single time I come they have always been consistent the amount of money that you spend at Taco Bell you get double the food and have leftovers for the next day.... Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I always come to this location because it's right by my work. Almost every time I order the order is wrong. Once I had to drive back THREE times for the same incorrect order, mind you I was also working. The third time I finally went inside and slammed my damn food on the counter and told them this was unacceptable. Today I was got stuck in the drive thru for 20 minutes for ONE chicken taco. This place is ridiculous and needs some kind of management. They are lacking in every sense of the word."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible. Each time I have been here the workers at the register are incredibly rude to the guests. You are much better off at the location on Losee and Ann."}
{"text":"Never eating here again. I found a nail in my order of Carne Asada Fries. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I love Roberto's! This one especially! Service could be more welcoming but their food is on point! I usually get one of 3 things for myself...carne asada fries, carne asada burrito or a chicken chimichanga. Their salsa bar is always stocked with fresh cucumbers and hot carrots every time I've made a stop here. This place is kept clean, plenty of seats of you want to dine-in and averagely priced for a taco shop. I will always come back to this place...weekly. lol! The only thing I really don't like about this place is how inconvenient it is getting into the little parking lot coming from the south on Ft Apache."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find a Roberto's near my workplace especially since I just had some the night before I came here. But boy was I met with total disappointment at this Roberto's establishment!   The facility itself is messy. The salad bar wasn't fresh AT ALL, the floor was sticky and needed sweeping, and the staff spoke very little to no English. On top of that, one of the counter personnel (I'm sorry I will not disclose who this person is nor their gender, I'm not trying to get anyone fired) came out to talk to my coworker and I about their oral health concerns (in Spanish). Now...I completely understand Spanish...but it takes me a little while still to form all the correct words in my head in order to carry a conversation in Spanish...but I responded to all the questions with English while still holding the tongues with hot carrots in them. They didn't get that I wasn't interested in that conversation. AT. ALL. Anyway that's beside the point...my point is...I'm on lunch....don't you think it's rude of you to approach anyone to talk about the pus coming out of your tooth you thought you extracted a year and a half ago?!?! I'm in the dental field...I have a strong stomach but yuck! That's not something I want to hear from a place where I'm getting my lunch!   So now...the food :( I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my co-worker ordered a chicken nacho plate thing with more chips than chicken. My chimichanga was full...and I mean FULL of onions...WTF where's the meat?!? I usually like onions but c'mon man! That was just too much! My co-worker's plate was full of onions too!!! She asked for more chips than chicken meat and she literally (and we counted) only had 9 chips!!!! She was pissed!   The food was edible. That's about it...nothing to wow about. I should have driven the extra 5 or 6 miles to the other Roberto's I went to the night before.  Not ever coming back to THIS Roberto's again."}
{"text":"Oooooh Myyyy Gooooodnesssss! I've been searching for something similar to San Diego's taco shops since I moved away from San Diego back in 2011 and...THIS IS IT! As a matter of fact this chain of Roberto's started in San Ysidro (in south San Diego) according to their banner inside celebrating 50 years of service!  WOW Am I impressed!!! They are a very clean establishment and have huge windows to view the back kitchen where you can see them actually preparing your order!...Goodbye hole in the wall mystery meat! The staff was super courteous...can't say much about the other customers that came in after us but I'm not reviewing them so who cares! Their salsa bar was clean, stocked to the brim and just excellently FRESH!   I ordered a carne asada burrito and OMG that first bite!...AMAZING! You can taste the fresh off the grill carne asada and it was spiced just right...no extra saltiness like most of these Mexican restaurants out here in Las Vegas. I can't rave about this place enough! I told my hubs that he was going to love it at the first bite...totally did!   Coming from San Diego my standards on Mexican food are pretty high. So...Right on Roberto's! You definitely delivered in taste quality and service! I commend you! (^_^)"}

{"text":"This place is good for lunch when I don't feel like eating the food in the work cafeteria. I usually get the California burrito or carne asada fries. Wednesdays there's dollar tacos and I think they still have dollar chicken tacos on Thursday's. Overall it's hearty, cheap, and convenient."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos!!! Stopped by on a whim and was so glad we did! Machaca was delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"That phot looks nasty. Get rid of that barf photo... ewww. I'm afraid to step in the door"}
{"text":"Delicioso!! Our first time trying this place! The lady that took our order was nice. Food was prepared fresh & fast! Rolled tacos were awesome & so was the chili relleno. They've got a station to add condiments too. Open 24hrs... It's the perfect 4th meal! ((All they are missing are margaritas))"}
{"text":"My main squeeze and I, were staying at La Quinta, down the street. We had a late-night craving for snacks/food, and although in pajamas and comfortable, we didn't want to wake hungry the next day.  I pulled up Yelp and searched for nearby places. We scrolled past McDonald's, but to see a mexican place open 24/7, is bound to get your attention. The reviews were favorable and the photos, mouth watering.  So we hopped in the car, sans a bra (this is Vegas, after all, people), and trekked over there.  Boy toy chose the rolled tacos (aka, taquitos) and said the guacamole was real good.  I selected the chicken tostada and that thing was huge and so dang good! The shell was hard, the refried beans and spanish rice on the side, were tasty. The added sour cream was cold and the cheese, lettuce, and such, really hit the spot!  Consider this place for lunch or dinner, as the food is great, and the price is really fair, for the amount you get."}
{"text":"The best tacos, burritos and came Asada fries in the NW,  always consistent, the best service too!"}
{"text":"It's the poster child for a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, but the food is good!  There is no bathroom facility for customers.  They offer a bottle of hand sanitizer.  The seating is limited, so I always get my food to go.  The service and food have always been good every time I go, which is about once or twice a month.  The prices are reasonable.  I noticed that this location offers twice as many 'aguas frescas' flavors than the few other Roberto's I've visited.  It would have been four stars if a bathroom was available for customers, so instead they get three."}
{"text":"They moved the beverage machine so that it is now self serve.  Had a carne asade torta today and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Went during lunch time and wow do they know how to hustle!   They had only one man working the one register.   He was taking orders,  filing drink orders and bagging food to go.   Not sure if that's the best practice when handling money.   Other than that,  the food was Delish as usual."}
{"text":"Solid good appetite destroying Mexican food- Carne asada fries are always a solid choice but most everything they serve is solid quality."}
{"text":"Unremarkable.  11 am on tuesday, was at Sam's Town and grabbed a bite while waiting for someone. Just needed a bite.  I had wondered about Roberto's having seen both pro and con. How disappointing at least this location.  I ordered the #5 combo beef burrito w/cheese enchilada.  Burrito came warm but not hot, not that much shredded beef, and sliced onion and peppers.  Not much taste to it overall...mediocre. Enchilada was ok tastewise with plenty of cheese & lettuce atop, more flavor than burrito, but not really even warm. The cheese was cooled. The red sauce was mild, just slightly warm and seemed like old El Paso canned. Yes could have given it back to them to heat but my questions aboit their quality were answered.  Did not really feel the need to eat further.  I recently had a Taco Bell new item...taco burrito...much better taste, composition and quality than this Robertos.  May try a spot they have closer to home but not going out of my way, & not with expectation.  A quick hit at the buffet ir even the McDonalds next door would have been more satisfying.   ."}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight while travelling in Las Vegas. Order the beef burrito and was very happy. A side of chips and a few vegetables from the salsa bar and I was very happy. Will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Francisco was so amazing ! He gave me such amazing suggestions !! BEST ROBERTOS in Las Vegas ! Thank you for the experience !"}
{"text":"I believe that no matter how fancy or casual a place of dining is, employees should take pride in their job and offer the absolute best customer service possible.  That being said, the reason for my low rating is due to the low quality of customer service I have just received. I ordered a veggie burrito without cheese & sour cream and added french fries. The cashier hesitated with my order then told me I'd have to pay extra for the fries. I had no problem with the extra charge and told him that was fine.  My boyfriend ordered a California burrito without meat. The cashier said he couldn't do that. We inquired as to why he couldn't do that, and the cashier just kept getting increasingly annoyed at the question. He kept saying it wasn't possible. My boyfriend orders this same California burrito without meat at the Southern Highlands location with no problem. This is our first time at this location so we were simply looking for an explanation as to why they can't make the California burrito without meat. After a bunch of back and forth, the cashier eventually gave in (while rolling his eyes) and said, \"This is the LAST time I'm gonna do this for you!\" This was also the first time lol. Not putting meat in a burrito is one less step for the cook and saves the company money by not wasting product. So we are still curious as to why the \"no meat\" alteration is not allowed at this location."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pork tacos and a quesadilla. Both lacking in flavor. The pork was to the point of overlooked and the quesadilla both had seriously no flavor, on the dryer side. I tried with and without the salsa..sauce the best one just overpowered the lack of flavor with heat, even the tomatoes were bland. My husband says if your starving and broke they are fine.... sorely disappointed. I hear rave reviews about Robertos... limes didn't even help."}
{"text":"Trash. The service is slower then molasses and when they mess up an order they wont want to compensate for you their mistake.. mind blowing I know. Stay clear of this location."}
{"text":"This review is for the location on Losee. I have been to this location several times before to buy carne asada fries,burritos and, a couple of other things on their menu.  This time I bought two chicken soft tacos. I have to honestly say they were not the best tasting tacos I have had in this location or any of the Roberto's locations.  Chicken had been marinated in some kind of red salsa sauce and it overpowered the chicken in itself.  If it wasn't for the shredded cheese and salsa Verde I put on top of them, I don't think I would have been able to eat the tacos. This Kind of neutralized the flavor but to be honest with you I can still taste the overpowering marinade the chicken was cooked in.  The location itself was clean there were ladies cleaning the dining area sweeping making sure it looked nice, so as far as appearance at least it was nice and organized, but as far as the food is concerned this time around I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"They don't have the combos they put on their website. Very upsetting. They should have changed their menu to match what's in the restaurant... BUT the food was great! !"}
{"text":"You would think with how many times they've cooked potatoes they'd have to get it right, but clearly that's not the case as every potato in my burrito was undercooked. Not that great biting into crunchy potatoes."}
{"text":"How does this place only have 4 stars and 9 reviews? The food is fantastic and the price is very nice."}
{"text":"This place is the filthiest robertos I have been to. Is that bulletproof glass?  It is good drunk food, especially for the area. Watch for the bums and the crazies. Once they are dodged, you're going to be okay. Carne Asada Nachos/Fries best on the menu."}
{"text":"Had breakfast burritos here with the wife one Saturday morning.  We were the only people in the joint.  Roberto's food is never overwhelming but it's usually average.  This visit was no different.  The burritos are ENORMOUS, so you get a lot of food for your money.  I recommend adding salsa, they can use some additional flavor.    This location was very clean, I'll give them that.  The salsa bar was clutter free and all of the tables were clean.  There are certainly better places for Mexican food, but Roberto's is reliable, inexpensive and quick."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was ok.   The rolled beef tacos were greasy and the beef didn't have much flavor.  They forgot to add my sour cream which may have made a difference.  Rice and beans were good but super salty."}
{"text":"I'm really enjoying my lunch here. Carne asada burrito platter rocks! Nice Mexican music in the background, very clean here too. Beans are kinda bland but everything else is tasty."}
{"text":"Roberto's is always the place to go in Vegas when you are low on money and very hungry. Sadly I was almost always both of those while I was in Vegas. LOL! My favorite was always the chicken chimi. This thing could fill King Kong up on a hungry day, and I hate to admit this but I loved how greasy and unhealthy it is. Go chimis! Go Roberto's!"}
{"text":"It was okay, I didn't like how this location keeps the bags for the sides behind their counter. Food was decent. Meet was kinda fatty but it served its purpose to settle my craving. Cheap prices though"}
{"text":"The most important thing about Roberto's is they roll the best breakfast burrito I've ever had anywhere. I'm talking ridiculously big and ridiculously good, with quality ingredients to boot. The tacos and salsas are good too.  And this quality grub is available 24 hours a day. Basically, Roberto's is outstanding *fast* Mexican food served out a mysterious drive through window (in what feels like the middle on nowhere) in the south Las Vegas suburbs. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I find it only fitting that my first review on Yelp be of our local late night Mexican take-out joint both for my absolute affinity for Mexican Food and my love for this gem of a Roberto's...Yes, I know - there are dozens of Roberto's locations across the valley and I have not sampled each establishment's fare, but having gone to a good number of them, I can honestly attest to the Bermuda location's superiority! While most of the favorite late night dishes (Super Fries, Three Rolled Tacos, Carne Asada Burritos, etc.) are similar to other locations, the difference is in the little details...the hot sauce here is not too seedy, the spicy carrots are always fresh and crisp and the friendly staff is always willing to make reasonable substitutions - a must for my pico-for sour cream trade-off on my California Burrito! MMMmmmm....."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Their breakfast burritos are so good. Today not so good. Skimped on bacon and the potatoes were not quit cooked. Worst of all, the people who work here have always been friendly and nice. This morning the female who waited on me was very rude. May have to find a different robertos in future."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuummmmm. The jaimaca is so refreshing and the carne asada nachos were on point."}
{"text":"Easily one of the sketchiest places I have ever been a patron at.  You order through bullet proof glass.  The clientele there range from pimps, hookers, gang-bangers, and old folks that will ask you for bus fare.  This is not my favorite of the Roberto's that I have been too.  The food quality and clientele is better elsewhere, and I'm not being bugged by people for money or food, or feel like my life is endangered just by ordering food there, but of all the Roberto's, this one has the most character, and it's close to Nellis AFB. Here I had a chicken taco (it was only 99 cents on Wednesdays!) and a pork torta (forgive me, there is a proper Mexican name for this, but it slips me, and is not worth the time to look up),  The meat in the torta was almost non-existent.  I have had it in another location and it had plenty of pork in it.  The chicken taco was great though.  Crunchy taco shell, just the right amount of cheese on top, and messy.  You can't beat them for the price. Come for the experience.  Hope you don't catch VD, a bullet, or a bum asking for a hand-out."}
{"text":"I frequented this location the most on a recent one month stay down in Las Vegas.  It was the cleanest and the quickest service.  Open 24 hours was convenient for when I was getting out of work at 4:30 in the morning.  I had everything from their taco's to their tortas to their burritos, all are wonderful.  You won't break the bank on a meal here too, which is great and rare to get a good value for your money these days!"}
{"text":"This is the final of the three locations that I visited while staying in Las Vegas.  I bought a beef taco and a carnitas torta.  I did not go inside, but instead used the drive through.  The order they initially handed me was incorrect, so my length of visit was over 15 minutes (in the drive through).  It was about 7am in the morning.  The food was excellent.  The torta had a lot of meat and was just perfect.  The taco had the finely shredded cheese and the perfect compliment of meat and lettuce all held together precariously with the very crispy taco shell.  It was cheap and tasted great!  The service was kind of lousy and they got my order wrong, although they did correct it.  That is why this location only gets a three star rating."}
{"text":"I finally got dragged along to that chain of Roberto's that are popping up everywhere in Vegas.  After hearing that some of the Roberto's aren't the cleanest ones, I was a bit hesitant and concerned I was without my Immodium.    The one on S. Fort Apache actually deemed pretty decent said my fellow diners as they are frequent eaters of the other Roberto's around Sin City.    I ordered the Rolled Tacos (2 chicken and 1 beef) with Guacamole.  They were okay.  I think the frozen ones I had at home were a bit better.  The guacamole was plentiful, but a little too sweet for what I had in mind.  It would have been superb it my cheese was melted a bit...maybe add the cheese first and then pour on the guacamole?  The insides of my rolled tacos weren't hot enough for my tastes either.  Overall, they just weren't crispy enough for something that just came out of the deep fryer.    I did get to try the Al Pastor soft tacos and those were definitely much yummier than my order!  The meat was super flavorful and definitely hitting my taste buds.  They taste even better when you load them up with freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce, and jalapeno peppers.  Unfortunately, my dining companion was a bit of a piggy and didn't bother saving any leftovers for me the next day!  Keep in mind that al pastor isn't offered at all the Roberto's, so take advantage of it when you find it on the menu.      Another friend ordered what looked like the Carne Asada Fries and that was one hell of a mutha focker order!  When you open up your styrofoam box, it's like damn...that's your dinner?  Major bang for your buck for sure!  (It was noted that my friend said he got more here than at the other Roberto's!)  I finished up my meal with a $2 large Horchata that was oh so yummy!  And for two bucks, what a deal!  Hot damn!  It's hard to finish one of those big gulps on your own, so share it!    We love Mexican restaurants that have a self service condiments section on the side.  I love loading up on tons of fresh limes, peppers, hot sauces, cucumbers, radishes, etc. without feeling like a pig 'cuz the staff isn't watching you overload.  And watch out for that red sauce, it's a kicker alright!   Side note: Their pictured menu up above definitely helps you decide what to order.  The prices vary per each Roberto's, so take note of that."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the customer service is horrible. The cashier was rude and disrespectful, she thought we didn't understand Spanish and was calling us gringos, etc.. This is embarrassing for a successful company and I hope you look to hire more professional employees."}
{"text":"I swear this receipt says no guacamole, but for some reason they heard EXTRA guacamole.. come on people! At least pretend to care. I was already disappointed with how much they raised the prices and now my order is wrong too! Lost my business for sure , and probably much more .. sushi prices for fast food that is messed up to order ..."}
{"text":"While decently priced, this is somewhere to only come when drunk. The food lacks any real flavor and is greasy. You get a lot of meat for $5 tostada but it's not really someone I'd come back to unless I was hard up for money lol"}
{"text":"We always hit Roberto's after a night of drinking while in Vegas. It's the perfect food for after the club or bar. The carne asada fries are bomb! They always hit the spot. They give you a lot, so it can be split into 2 meals. They were super cheesy, and lots of guacamole and meat. The carne asada burrito was pretty good too. Love that it's 24 hours, so I can get my Mexican food fix any time. I've been a loyal customer since 2011, and that's never going to change."}
{"text":"Yum!  So good!  Decent price, great food, huge portions... I ordered the Beef Chimichanga and was not disappointed... I will be back!!"}
{"text":"So there's no line and there's a cashier who were talking to other girl and she saw me and my bf and the thing is she didn't even greeted us and like she went to the register, turned around and talk to her co worker and I'm like \"hi!\" With manners of course .. And she got our Order then when our order is up, my pine apple juice is missing and she is no where to be found and her guy co worker did my pine Apple juice like seriously bad service smh"}
{"text":"There are few Roberto shops that make FRESH carne asada fries... and this one amongst the few. If you like your hot food hot, this is the place to go!  Oh.. And this location is also very clean compared to the other Roberto's!"}
{"text":"If I could have gave it 0 Stars I would have, I will never eat here or order food from here again.  They Nickel and Dime you to the max!  I was charged extra for Tomatos, cilantro, and a small dab of sour cream.  The girl working the register was rude and impatient and she got almost the entire order wrong!   When we called to speak to the manager we were rudely told it was our fault and that they filled the order correctly!!!  On top of all that the food was poorly prepared and carelessly thrown together!  Fausto's is much better I wish I had drove the extra 1/2 mile and enjoyed my Meal!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Found a bug in my food. They actually offered to make me me another dish. I pretty much had to argue to get my money back. Worst place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Growing up we lived down the road from an amazing taco shop. They had these amazing carne asada burritos that I have dreamed about for almost 15 years after moving away and the shop closing down. Robertos carne asada burrito is one degree less than the one that I probably remember as better as it was! But man, so excited to find something close! We love the rice and beans and the chimichanga and tacos... okay we've loved everything that we've ordered...."}
{"text":"Although it isn't the classiest one,  the food is always great, the workers polite, and very clean.  They like on the gauc and cheese, and never over cook. I hate it when the tortillas are darker brown, haven't had one yet like that here.  My new go to Roberto's. Ps tip them, they appreciate it, and the gauc glows even freer. :)"}
{"text":"Decent Roberto's, standard look  and food. However it smelled like the dog pound! Just like the dog pound.  I ate anyway, I have the stomach of a goat, but I won't rush back!  Tostada was good, not broken, place was clean."}
{"text":"I admit I have a soft spot for this Robertos. Site of a first date, AND a rather awesome memory in a parking lot!   They make the Tostados and chips just dark enough, the shells don't crumble, the tables are usually clean, and the keep the salsa car stocked.  There is always plenty of parking, and Wednesday is $.99 Chicken Taco Day! Whohoo!    Some locations run out of ice or don't have the air on on summer, but this one always has both.  The only thing marking them down is that sometimes the grease puddles on the plate. Letting the fried food drip for a second or keeping the oil hotter would fix it, moving them to a perfect score."}
{"text":"This is one of my two Go To Roberto's.  Good consistent, and always polite.  Thus one does get very crowded. Make a new fiend so you can share a table crowded.  But.... Rolled Tacos. Nuff said."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican place in my hood. Love me some spicy carrots and onions. I always get the shrimp cocktail. Delish. They so a pretty good job at the drive thru providing salsa."}
{"text":"Even though we'd eaten at another franchise location in CA the food here was extremely over salted and otherwise lacking in flavor! Won't go back."}
{"text":"Rude! I ordered a taco salad and it was soggy so I called to tell them I wasn't happy and the lady said to come back and she would refund me. Well when I did the lady rang in what I described that I needed a refund on and I was charged again!!! When she refunded it the machine was \"off line\" I tried to explain that to her but I might as well be talking to a \"wall\" ! Well I tried to call the owner manager corporate and they didn't call me back for three days then the manager called back and said he did my double charge without my authorization refund over again and guess what happened?!?!! No refund and when I called to inform them they laughed in my face."}
{"text":"The roomie and I had a late night taco craving,.and finally found this place in a gas station..of all places. Lol. They give great portion sizes.I got the adobada n the carnitas taco. I wanted lengua but they ran out :( bummers next time I guess. Anyways the guys were really nice. The food was great n our cravings were satisfied.  Plus u can get gas at the same time!!! Bonus!!!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is bomb! This location is great, they are fast and the food always tastes great. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this Roberto's location I haven't been there in over a year but I just wanted to give a shout out to my ladies that work there I used to always come in and get the carne asada fries they were the best in the world I used to get there rolled tacos amazing I used to get the shredded beef tacos amazing there are really clean there and the service was great they knew I only know a little bit of Spanish so they would help me when I would try to speak to them and it's open 24 hours you can't get no better than that but if you ladies read this I miss you and by the way I live in California now and carne asada fries out here suck really bad I really want to go back to Las Vegas just so I can order my carne asada fries from this location"}
{"text":"Love that it's open late!!! Carne asada fries are super delicious! My husband got a breakfast burrito and he loved it. He loved the thin tortilla the burrito was wrapped in."}
{"text":"I've been going to Roberto's for so many years. Not a lot has changed except the prices! If you want yummy mexican fast food that is a better then Taco Bell this is your place. They have drive thrus and most are open 24 hours.   I've always liked them for a late night meal. Some of my favorte things to get are the Carne Asada Nachos, a Chicken Chimichunga and cheese enchiladas. I also enjoy their menudo on the weekends.   Roberto's is yummy for sure! It's a clean location and has friendly staff. The salsa bar is  always stocked and has fresh salsa. If you've never been your missing out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner and ordered their adobada (marinated pork) burrito that comes with just guacamole and salsa.  The burrito was good but definitely dripping with grease.  The also grill the tortilla so it gets really crispy but chewy at the same time.   The reason I gave this place 5 stars is for the kind hearted workers. A homeless man came in the store and only had two dollars so he ordered a chicken taco. The workers hesitated for a bit, and then said that they had an extra order of 2 burritos made and gave that to him!  It's really great to see that people have generous hearts!"}
{"text":"Robertos is a regular go to for my self, my family, visitors, and many friends. It is not upscale by any stretch and certainly not fancy sit down mexican food. But it is all very tasty recipes and wonderful prices. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for tasty Mexican east served up quick and cheap. Better quality, prices, and certainly more authentic than ANY fast food chain around."}
{"text":"First time food is good but bad customer service  They make you feel stupid  I ordered taco  and my gosh taste awful"}
{"text":"I am so upset I went to get rolled tacos today and i ate the first one it was delicious but the second one I bit into something was poking the back of my throat!!! It was a mother fucking tooth pick!!!! You people need to fucking get it together this is the second time that some similar has happened to me and it's crazy! I will never go to this fucking robertos again"}
{"text":"I ordered my meal very clearly to the cashier but they got it wrong. I didn't like the food it was dry. I won't be eating there again. The floors were dirty too."}
{"text":"Yes it's next to a gas station and attached to the mini-mart, but you don't come here for the ambiance, you come here because you need quick Mexican food.  I couldn't help but laugh when I realized that they also sell buffalo wings and fries, and there was a family sitting next to us that had ordered it.  They have a stainless steel cart next to the cashier with pickled carrots and cucumbers, salsas, and whole strips of green onion.  The trays were kind of empty when I went, which was around lunchtime on a weekend.  Carne asada fries or nachos.  That is all."}
{"text":"We used to hit up this place on our way home from Vegas every time for the awesome menudo and carnitas burritos. We stopped today and we ordered menudo that has no hominy it was ok. Then I ordered huevos rancheros and specifically told the lady to not cook the yolk of my eggs I like them runny. Of course when I got my food it was topped with globs of salsa . The salsa tasted horrible too. I scraped it off and of course the eggs underneath were over cooked . Didn't even bother to let them know cause she already looked like she was in a bad mood . I'll stick to my rule . Never eat Mexican food out of my house . Won't be coming back to this sorry excuse for Mexican food . Worst part is everything is served in crappy plastic plates ."}
{"text":"Compared to everywhere else, Robertos ranks low for me.  When it comes to indulgence after a night of drinking, there's no place like this Mexican fiesta!  Whenever I come to Roberto's, no matter what location, I tend to get the same two things:  Carnitas Burrito and/or Carne Asada Fries!  On this night, I got the Carne Asada Fries.  This meal is huge!  Crispy fries smothered (and when I say smothered, I really mean it LOL) with all the Mexican fixings:  sour cream, onions, cheese, guacamole just to name a few.  The carne asada is perfectly seasoned and cut into strips.  Every bite is packed with flavor and the combination can cure any drunk tummy.    This particular location was packed with a younger crowd.  A.) probably because it was right across of the UNLV and B.) It was like 3 in the morning.  The staff was nice, nothing that stood out.  Bathrooms were disgusting.  I'm not going to get into details, but I have NEVER seen a Roberto's bathroom in good shape.    Trust me.  NOTHING in here is healthy, however, if you're looking to get your drunk munchies on, this is the place.  Come by and check out the fries.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"First time at Roberto's and I'm not disappointed. I tried the number four, which comes with two tacos (beef or chicken), rice, and refried beans for $7. The rice and beans were excellent. At first i wad disappointed with the tacos as I did not think there looked to be a lot of chicken on them;  however, as i was eating them I quickly realized there was plenty of meat.  The hard shell tacos were good, but a little chewy.    They seemed to have a pretty extensive menu with a wide range of entrees and sides.  The staff was pleasant.  I really liked that they have a little buffet where one can get their own salsas and toppings - they even have to go containers to make it easy!   Overall, I will definitely be trying again."}
{"text":"I love this Roberto's especially the night crew! I've been coming to this locations since I was a teenager it was my hang over location lol. The pretty lady with green eyes is always nice as well and the night coook he always makes everything perfect"}
{"text":"Roberto's is sub par Mexican food to begin with but when you add in a dirty restaurant. Rude service and employee behind the counter, old salas and condiments it just makes it worse. I called ahead for my order and then when I got there 10 minutes later it wasn't ready and the cashier said \"it's almost done we are making it now.\" The cook hadn't even started the order yet. I got home and my order was wrong. Went back and then he argued with me about the order being wrong and would only remake one of the burritos. I took the whole uneaten, cut in half (to share with two others)  order with me back to the restaurant. He put on gloves then took my old order and opened it up to inspect. After discussing the the anatomy of my dissected burritos he concluded that only one was made incorrectly and I could have back the \"correct\" order so he wrapped it back up for me..."}
{"text":"For Vegas locals, they know how tasty Roberto's is but this place takes the cake! Clean, spacious, and the quality of their food is amazing! I've been to so many Roberto taco shops (bc I love me some Mexican food!) and this location NEVER fails to let me down when it comes to their service! Drop by if you're in a mood for a late night snack, and I guarantee you're hooked!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent,  and the customer service is great. We will be back for more. Every time I have gone in there and ordered food they get it out in a reasonable amount of time and haven't messed an order up."}
{"text":"Roberto's is one of my favorite places to get Mexican food~ It's cheap and good, not to mention, this location is really clean and empty!! So far, this is the only Roberto's that I really enjoy eating at because of its cleanliness. The staff is really friendly and pretty quick at preparing your food :)   Some of my favorite things to order is the carne asada enchilada or the burrito! Mmm! It makes me hungry just thinking about it! Also, to the left of the cash register there is a sauce bar where your fave hot sauces are located along with to-go cups and various veggies.  However, there are some things on the Roberto's menu that are just too small or too untasteful to be sold! So, be careful when ordering! Otherwise, enjoy a nice enchilada at this fun & clean location :)"}
{"text":"Yes, there are heaps of Roberto's in Vegas... and California, for that matter.  I'm just adding this location because I wasn't aware of it until I drove past it after selling my kidney filling up my car with fuel at the Chevron.    Great hard shell tacos, and rolled tacos (taquitos)... the rice is just as flavorful as the locations in San Diego.    ... and I thought Roberto's only tasted good after a surf session!  Give em a try!   Mahalozzzz!"}
{"text":"Should be called reliable Roberts because they're all 24 and everywhere. Some are not as good but only slightly. The girl that rang me up was not the most personable but not rude either, she looked stressed and everyone has their day (or month ;). I like the \"go 2 Carne Asada burrito, recommend the Carne Asada nachos, or when I'm feeling like a baller the chimichanga! Hubbahubba!)"}
{"text":"Still my go-to taco place in Vegas. I've never had a bad experience at any Roberto's taco shop. Order whatever sounds or looks good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always come to this Roberto's because it's so close to my house but every time they either mess up my order or they do something to mess it up. For instance a while ago I ordered a breakfast burrito no pico add beans. I even asked the guy if my burrito had beans and he said no pico add beans. When I got home it had pico and no beans. Another time I was craving Carne  asada fries and everywhere I've ordered them they have been really good. When I got home my fries look like they threw everything on cold and steamed it in  microwave. It sounds like I'm complaining but I'm not picky it just looked really gross and wasn't that tasty either.The other night my boyfriend got a carnitas burrito with rice and no guac ( by the way the guac is not freshly made its out if a bag with no flavor ) and I had a bite. It was super good carnitas was crispy and juicy and delicious. Of course the one time it's good I don't order for myself. So Today I went again and ordered a California burrito since they did a good job on the burrito from the other night. The potatoes were mush and had the consistency of mashed potatoes . If I wanted mashed potato I would eat mashed potato. When I order the cal burrito at the Roberto's on cactus and Bermuda the food is always good and the fries are crispy in the cal burrito. This place is either hit or miss most of the time it's a miss. I suggest driving to a different Roberto's because this one is not the place to come to."}
{"text":"I always come back here no matter how many times they mess up my order. 9 times out of ten my order is not correct and it just doesn't taste right. Employees always coming and going. Sad part is I always go back because it's two minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Okay, so I lived in Vegas for a total of 5 years. Coming from San Diego (where I now live again), Roberto's is a staple taco shop. A great place to get your 24 hour Mexican food munchie on! But I also know that there's alot of \"imitators\" out there with taco shops. I just called whose \"-bertos\" because it's usually just some other prefix with the \"berto\" name attached (Alberto's, Filberto's, Juanberto's). Anyway, when I saw a \"Roberto's\" down the block from where I lived, I figured it to be just a knock off of the ones in San Diego.   I pull up to the drive-through to be greeted by the same broken English that I get at other places, \"Mah, I help tu?\" I play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito. My order is repeated and confirmed. When I pull up to the window, sure enough there's a customer service sign with none other than Jose Roberto's phone number and address. Complete with 619 area code and Chula Vista zip code. I was stoked that this was an actual Roberto's!  The food I got resembled what I got in San Diego. It's as authentic as your going to get for a taco shop in Vegas. My only disappointment is that I didn't realize how many there were in Vegas. Man, have I been missing out!!!   The food was great and I ate there many times during my stay in Vegas. It was a nice little reminder of San Diego and good food when your drunk and need something to fill your stomach.  Could have gave this place a Four Star. But let's face it, it's a taco shop. You know what you're going into when you get there."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The food is fresh with every bite! You will get drunk of this food! First time coming in and the only taco stand close to us and they didn't disappoint us. The enchilada/ taco combo has a fresh taste with a little kick of the red salsa. I was amazed at how tasty it was! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Got a burrrito from here Thu/9 Apr about 11 pm: - Clean, spacious place. - Burrito was ok."}
{"text":"Figured this place could use a recent review as the last were almost a year ago. I have only been to Roberto's a few times and this was my first time visiting this particular one. We just moved in not too far away and decided to stop in on the way home from a night out. This is definitely not the most glamorous place but the guy at the register was kind and outgoing and I liked that you can see into the kitchen and watch everything that goes on. It was after 1am I believe and its one of the better non-fast food options. The breakfast burrito was huge (I actually wish they had a smaller option) and a bit heavy for a late night meal... however it was very tasty. I'm sure I'll be back now that it is so close. I always see a bunch of people there when I drive by so this location must do fairly well despite the negative reviews. Hopefully my experiences stay positive moving forward!"}
{"text":".99 cent chicken tacos on Wednesdays.  You cannot go wrong. Condiment bar is fresh and full. I would visit again"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! The cashiers at this location don't know what they are doing! I asked for a carne asada burrito with red sauce on top and  aka a wet burrito, she told me no, she doesn't feel like making it! First of all, that's rude!  2 I'm the paying customer I get the order the way I want even if it means me paying more. And three where the hell is customer service!! Never again!! I has to talk to the manager and she said they don't have one???? Really??"}
{"text":"The soda fountain smells like mildew!!! We tried the Dr Pepper and thought it was the cup after switching cups and lids and straw it still smell and tastes like mildew!!! We let the employees know and they got mad at us that we even complained."}
{"text":"Total crap... Ordered  chimichunga,,, it was not good...  Sorry to say Taco Hell is gourmet compared to this shit this place sells... Avoid at all costs or bring TUMS..."}
{"text":"They have the best burritos there, I just moved from California and I was looking for a Mexican restaurant and when I found them I was stunt. Fast service great food and the salsas are great. Their selection of drinks is great too. They have sodas and waters like horchata and tamarindo. They also have a good menus and specials of the week with are always great to see more food for less money I would say. Robertos also has different desserts that you can choose from their not made in there but they are pretty tasty. Like I said I love that place for the burritos but I'm sure the other options are as good as the burrito. Defiantly should check it out."}
{"text":"This is thee worst Roberto's in Las Vegas that I've been to. Hubby & I have been eating Roberto's from San Diego to here for 20yrs+ and this 1 store their food is sooo GREESY which is sad cuz we're RIGHT around the corner. I expect better cuz it's by the Lakes & Red Rock however NOTTT. I actually got the Wednesday tacos 1 night & threw up within 2 hrs. Hubby joked it was all the grease. I now believe it!  We've been there many times during different hours and same ol shit. GREESY.  Don't understand it cuz other locations r NOTTT like this(from r experience) Update: Reynaldo from Robertos called me. He was very kind. He said they r not draining the tacos long enough & was gonna follow up w/this location. I agree. I've worked in restaurants for going on 16 yrs,13 w/MGM corporation. I'll just still use the other 2 locations I love. Like I told Reynaldo  this is NOT gonna stop me from eating Roberto's. Their food is gooood.  Thank u Reynaldo for ur courteous call back."}
{"text":"All the reviews for this place (positive ones, at least) involve copious amounts of alcohol.  If I have to be intoxicated to enjoy a food, it just must not be very good.  Sorry, but Roberto's beef tastes like horse meat when you're sober.  It's all gray and hard... kinda reminds me of that scene from the movie Animal House when they scared that horse to death and had to chop it up to fit it through the door.  Now I know where the poor creature ended up!  The place was also really filthy."}
{"text":"I usually love robertos but this location is the worst one I've ever been to. I ordered a carne asada burrito added beans and rice, side of beans, and a bean and cheese burrito. Everything was terrible, wasn't hot, wasn't fresh, tasted dry, stale, and as if they had it premade. I will never recommend this place to anyone. If you want late night food, go to the one on forte and tropicana"}
{"text":"For those of you from Cali or west coast in general, you know what Roberto's is about. Since I've moved out here all I've been seeing is Roberto's all over LV. This location is the one right by the airport. Roberto's taco shops are generally known for their big portions and cali burritos. I dropped by this location with my friend around 12:00pm for some lunch. It wasn't crowded or packed at that hour.   Was in the mood for some California burritos with guac came to be around $11. Good size burrito overall but the taste was 7/10. I also got the Carnitas fries for $10... taste 6/10  The bathrooms were really messy and which was a bit frustrating. Hope they keep the restaurant cleaner in the future."}
{"text":"Ahh, Roberto taco shop. And old trusty favorite.  This is what I love about Roberto's, no matter what time it is, breakfast lunch or even dinner, I know that my Carne asada fries are going to to be amazing and so yummy. The cure to any hangover if you haven't tried it yet will be the carne asada burrito. It's a Roberto's standard and a cure all. Happy eating at my favorite hole in the wall."}
{"text":"If you are in West Las Vegas and are looking for a quality taco.. A place to find eats after the club... Then here is your place.  This place is very simple. There are a few chairs outside to enjoy these wonderful tacos, or you can take them to go.  **note: there's free WiFi out by these chairs as well**  No complaints about the service. It kind of reminded me of tacos that my mom makes.  I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Tamales were okay. Fiancé got the chimichanga which was good. If you're going to eat here, get the chimichanga."}
{"text":"Slow service in a an empty restaurant. If you plan on gettin my food here be sure to call ahead to order your food."}
{"text":"I love their food and drinks but, they always get my order wrong. My taco shells will be busted and my fish is normally burnt. When I called to complain after experiencing this three times they weren't friendly. I now take my business to the store on lake mead."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic and likely always will be. But this particular location likes to skimp on portion sizes and consistently gets my order incorrect. Hopefully this time everything goes well!"}
{"text":"Can't make a burrito to save there lives. They need the San Diego guys to come teach them how to make some good old fashion taco shop food. Disgraceful to the Roberto's name."}
{"text":"How hard is it to take an order correctly?  I ordered several items for lunch today 4 of the items were correct but i question why they smother their tamales in sauce not appetizing at all....  I also ordered a combo 2 tacos with rice & beans and asked for shredded beef but instead i get 2 chicken tacos which in my opinion is very bland no flavor to it at all...  I still recommend this place for decent  grub but it sort fails at customer service"}
{"text":"This place use to have great asada fries, aww the good old days. Compared to other places I wouldn't buy them here again. Many places are offering with better tasting meat. The asada was so bland here that I felt bad I wasted my lunch coming here. I placed an order so I wouldn't waste much of my lunch waiting for them to make my food. When I showed up, they started making it! No point of ordering over the phone then, that's what cost them a star. The salsas were good, better than the meat. I had to drown my fries to get a good taste. All in all this place is starting to disappoint, and with more competition around. Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     46/100  Bleh. My brother picked up a chicken chimichanga for me from here today and it was bleh. It was still edible, but not as good as Fausto's version. I asked him, \"why didn't you go to Fausto's?\" (Fausto's is our go-to) His reason being Roberto's was conveniently located next door to the cell phone repair shop.\"  Reasons for this rating:  - Brother said the sliced cucumbers tasted like detergent. Maybe some cleaning liquids got in.  - Chimichanga was filled with fillers -- aka flavorless bland onions, peppers, etc. that didn't go well and less chicken compared to Fausto's Chimichanga.  - The sides of guacamole and sour cream was half as less as Faustos.  - The hot sauces had no flavor to it, and overly spicy. Watered down as well. - The tamarind drink was watered down.  - Oh, and I know this sounds gross but their carne asada burrito smells like my pup's poo. Not joking and not kidding. Sorry, but it's better that I mention it here.   I don't usually compare in a review, but with the quality of food we received from here, I say you're better off going down the street to Fausto's on Stephanie and American Pacific. I've never been disappointed with their food and it's the same price. Trust me, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     52/100  More of a 3.5 stars. I'm still a Fausto's over Roberto's fan, but as far as Roberto's this is one of the better locations in the southern area of Las Vegas. This is the only Roberto's I like and go to lately because family and friends live within a 2 mile radius. We usually order take out and eat at their house.    Great things about this location:  - DRIVE THRU! - fast service - rarely busy when I go.  - Food is consistently good. Never had a bad experience with taste.  - My go-tos are the burritos, carne asada fries, tortas, tacos, horchata.   Most recently I had the carne asada torta. I really liked their bread. What I liked about their torta is the bread was soft with a little crisp on the outside. It was so soft that it fell apart easily while trying to eat the sandwich. Good and bad but I didn't mind, I just used a fork. Also the bread is huge, fills the take out container but the torta doesn't have as much meat as Fausto's torta."}
{"text":"Omg. This is authentic Mexican. Hand shredded chicken and the food is soooooo fresh!! I would suggest this place to anyone who wants fast fresh Mexican food!!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"EPIC FU**ING FAIL!!!!!! The only reason why I gave this place a star is because the guy at the cash register was extremely friendly however I'm on the hunt for some good Mexican food I come across this place not too far from my house it has a decent amount of stars I get in there and ask the guy for a chicken burrito with he asked me do I want shredded or grilled I said shredded  I asked the guy if it came with cheese he said he don't know((WTF)) you work here you getting paid for this what do you mean you don't know!!!!! so I did not get rude keep in mind it's one o'clock in the afternoon and I have not eaten all day so my attitude is not the best right now ...so I say well what comes on the burrito he says chicken and tomatoes((WTF)) I said ...no onions no cilantro ???he said yeah that too I said okay will let me have a chicken burrito with and let me add sour cream and cheese ....I get the burrito is wrapped up in foil that's not how a eet burrito comes ((WTF)) by this time I'm just ready to walk out I get home I'll take a bite into the burrito all I get is chicken.... I'm like okay sometimes the good stuff be in the middle... I take another bite of the burrito I get chicken sour cream and cheese my third bite of the burrito chicken cheese sour cream so I open it up there's nothing in the burrito!!!!!! but cheese and sour cream ((WTF))where is the onions and cilantro where's the tomatoes he told me about ??????? like if I would not have asked for cheese and sour cream would I only got chicken in a tortilla??? I am extremely disappointment needless to say I will not be returning...and I'm outta $7 bucks...AND!!!! I'M STILL HUNGRY!!!"}
{"text":"I am not really reviewing the food per se...everyone has had Roberto's, and everyone knows you can find better Mexican food elsewhere.  But when Tacos El Gordo is closed at 3am, this is the first place some people think of when they want salty mexican food lol.  We ordered the old favorite, the carne asada fries...which come in a huge tub for about $7-8.  They are huge, and two hungry people can pound em out and not need more.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so the food came out fairly fast, but their was a little bit of food on the ground and the bathroom was a mess.  They probably run a thin crowd at night, but somebody trashed it and it wasn't cleaned by the time I got there.  It is a solid place to eat late, but if you are coming down here during the day time, you can do a LOT better"}
{"text":"This Roberto's location is always great and super friendly. The establishment is clean and the salsa bar is always stocked fresh."}
{"text":"Love their chicken burrito its the best there is prices are great and service is decent they get 5 stars if they were a little bit faster and a lil bit more polite"}
{"text":"Ok this is better than taco bell. The burritos are gigantic so you do get a lot for your money...but they are kinda greasy and unhealthy . Some sides cost extra like sour cream, cheese, salsa etc. So the price can go up pretty quickly if you order lots of add ons' so double check what is included on your item first.  Overall this place is cheap convenient eats.  I'd go here for convenience, but It isn't my favorite. It does have its good points. I'd give a 3 1/2 if I could. The customer service has been great so far."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their amazing breakfast burritos!! They are huge and delicious! They are big enough that you can share 1 burrito with someone! And I really enjoy not cooking on Wednesday's for their $1 hard shell chicken tacos!! Only complaint would be it takes them some time to prepare the food. When u order in person it takes a good 20 minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"For the price and quality. I've had better.  When I go to a Mexican Restaurant, I like to try their lengua (tongue) because it's how I can tell if they put thought and effort into their cooking.   The Lengua at Roberto's is flavorless and greasy. I've had better in Los Angeles.   The positive note with Robertos is their burrito contents. They will give you a burrito filled with meat. So filling... but flavor, it's lacking."}
{"text":"So I went to the Roberto's across from UNLV because I had a random urge to eat carne asada fries. Now, I only get this urge once every few months because after I eat them I always feel like dying, but it's still always worth it. So the carne asada fries were priced at around $8 which isn't a bad price for the amount of food you get.  The carne asada fries come topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and probably more. I would tell you everything, but once you mix it together it looks like one big mash up of amazingness. The fries were pretty delicious, but filling. One order can most definitely be shared by two.  I've seen some other reviews talk about the service, but I had pretty decent service when I went. The cashier greeted me and my friend as soon as we walked in, and had our order out in a much shorter time than I had predicted.   Would I come here again? yeah, probably just for the fries. While the other food looked decent, I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food."}
{"text":"I also have Postmates and anytime I am looking for a quick delivery I choose Roberto's! Not only do I love their quick food choices but I love their entrees as well! So much so I wish they had more delicious dishes to choose from!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this location! They were so accommodating to my giant order for the guys at work... 10 churros at 8:30 AM! So many breakfast burritos. They are fast, super friendly and it's very clean :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to any Roberto's in a hot minute. Like 3 years of hot minutes... but DANG. This trip really hit the spot. Everyone who complains about the portion sizes must be doing it wrong.  We had a weird late day and dinner was at 10 PM. No biggie, as it was the first Saturday of summer vacation for us. We were on our way back from a night play session at Craig Ranch and we were super hungry! Thank goodness for 24 hour spots. I ordered the Chorizo plate with corn tortillas (a #8, I believe?) and T ordered 6 chicken taquitos sans cheese. We decided to dine in and relax.   The salsa bar was clean and well stocked. Service was prompt and courteous. I was actually shocked when I saw the size of my meal. It was HUGE. There was the perfect amount of chorizo to egg ratio. The rice was moist and had several chunks of jalapeño and tomato. The beans were topped with cheese and were nice and creamy. Hidden underneath all of my chorizo and egg was a nice portion of fresh, shredded lettuce with a good size fallow of guac. I polished it all off and it was SO good. Really hit the spot! T's taquitos were hot and fresh (but he's impatient so he insisted he wrap a napkin around so that he was able to immediately enjoy)- crispy, filled with well seasoned chicken. He immediately devoured 3 and saved 3 for home.   I'm super glad we stopped in on a whim last night. It totally re-ignited my love for this place."}
{"text":"This was just a little hole in the wall and it was fantastic!  The menu board on the wall with the photos reminded me of a take-out Chinese place which was pretty funny! I had a burrito and it was fresh and tasty.  They also seemed to have fun chatting with their regular customers which seemed to have a steady steam in while I was there.  A definite stop for an inexpensive plate of Mexican food if you are in the area"}
{"text":"I have seen a lot of these chains since I moved here and was hoping that I found my go to place for mexican food.   I ordered a carna asada burrito and the meat was decent quality but way too much salt in on it.   Maybe I got a bad batch but first impressions make a lasting impression.   Might give it another go when I craving mexican and dont want to drive far."}
{"text":"if you happen t be in Vegas and want a quick bite? well this is the place, I had a carne asada burrito and it was loaded with carne asada not to mention delicious."}
{"text":"Bacon breakfast burrito! Typical robertos but they have a great selection of Mexican beverages..always an option"}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada fries over the phone, came to the restaurant 10 minutes later and walked out. Easy.   I've been here about a handful of times and I haven't had a problem so far. They're pretty fast to making your food when you order, and the food is usually on point."}
{"text":"I like this location but I think they need more workers it gets really busy and seems they don't have a a good way of handling all of the customers . Other than that they are a lil stingy with the meat on the super nachos"}
{"text":"wanted some Mexican food. Went along time ago to Roberto's and it was not bad that I couldn't do it again. But this spot on fort apache was horrible. Food tasted old like it been there all day. No flavor very greasy.  The only thing good was the pickled carrot and onions. Wasted 7.46 and the dam cashier don't speak English and if he did he looks at you like he don't understand and nods his head yes to every thing. Place was clean though. I will never trust Roberto's. Again my stomach hurt from the little I tried to eat. Just NASTY!!!!!!!!!!! SO GREASY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  I came around 10:00 p.m.  The lady was so rude and bad manners.  All of us enjoyed good food but also like to see nice people."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant at the middle of the lunch hour.  It was clean, the order taker was polite and courteous, and the order came quickly.  The carne asada burrito and horchata drink were fresh, flavorful, and very filling.  Based on this first time experience, I will definitely come back again since it is very close to my job and left me with an excellent impression."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Robertos taco shop. The beans are second to none. I am a definite chicken taco and bean burrito guy. Every time I come here my wife expects a little bowl of beans and cheese. I'll be a customer for life."}
{"text":"I bought this expensive food for my family, and it was the worst. We all got sick, I don't think anything was fresh. The chef made the food in 2min everything was cold and I live just across the street."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've never felt any attitude from their staff, despite seeing how hard they work and the late night drunken riff-raff and kids they put up with, being 24hrs.   The ingredients always taste fresh, delicious. Awesome soda fountain with unlimited refills of all the typical sodas, sweet and unsweet teas, JUICES and HORCHATA'S! (that alone is almost worth it!)   And no where else in Vegas will you find such a delicious and large sized Machaca Torta (Shredded beef, egg and onion sandwich on fresh baked bread) for only $4.00! Half of it is a meal!  I go there all the time after a late night work out at 24hr fitness. Love it. People are very particular about their Mexican food, but these people are a class act, and the service alone is worth it.   I'm not a fan of Ranchero or loud music either, but they play the CLASSIEST, most pleasant Mexican music from the 40's 50's and 60's at a low, pleasant volume. The ambiance is great too! And unlike a lot of other 24hr taquerias, they always have nice, spacious tables to sit in 24/7.   If this place had wifi or served coffee, I'd be there almost every night."}
{"text":"I didn't want to go to Roberto's in the first place, but this is what happens when I throw caution to the wind and tell my husband, \"You choose. Whatever you say, I won't protest. We'll go there.\" This was close by and open, so he thought it was a rather logical choice and/or he was really excited to eat a big greasy burrito. Either way, we arrived. The environment is sparse, very sparse. The fluorescent lighting, aging paint and general worn down state made me a little uneasy. The staff was friendly, so I tried to keep an open mind. I ordered the carnitas plate and awaited the results. To summarize: everything was very salty, and the pork was dry with the only prevailing flavor being that of fat. My error was probably not getting everything wrapped up in a tortilla and covered with other ingredients to create a sum that could have only been better than its parts. My husband seemed reasonably pleased with his burrito. I have been to other Roberto's and found it acceptable in the right circumstances, but from the environment to the meal, this experience was just too disappointing. Better ingredients, less salt and a fresh coat of paint would go a long way."}
{"text":"when I want a fish taco, I usually find one of the Roberto's and general I'm happy.  HOWEVER, today I went to a different one, this one on Horizon.  I ordered my usual fish tacos to go.  When I got home I noticed that the piece of fish was so small, I couldn't even find it underneath all the lettuce.  I was furious, but not willing to drive all the way back and throw it in their faces. Be warned about this location, if you order to go, make sure you check your order before leaving otherwise they will CHEAT you."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant and provides fast service. Great place to grab a quick meal. Isn't the best in taste but it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Not Roberto's anymore (Maria's Taco Shop now?)... probably because they got their franchise pulled.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I Love Roberto's... but this one has a sewer problem. Kinda hard to enjoy carnitas when it smells like sulfur.  We went twice two weeks apart and it had the same problem  Go to the one on Rainbow between Robindale/Warm Springs"}
{"text":"The amount of garlic this cook put in my food was ridiculous. Paid extra for things I have never been charged for in the past. I am so disappointed. If your cook doesn't want or know how to make something simply tell me when I order; don't make the food inedible."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a 4.8 do that I looked like an actual person who comes here a lot. Taco Wednesdays are my families favorite.  Today however,  is Friday and I had a craving for a taco salad. Yum.  Always friendly fast service."}
{"text":"I'd like to complain and say, wtf, you really raised your prices!!??  And for fast food at that!  But I digress.  The food here is great! It's on point with any sit down Mexican Restaurant only I get to take it home and binge watch Netflix and chill with my husband!   The staff is always friendly, fast and they always get our order right!  I'd like to suggest they get a good salsa.  The green/red sauce is good but I want some chips and real salsa!!  This go round the hubs had a shrimp burrito with rice and beans on the side and I had carnitas nachos.  Both were actually really good!    This particular Roberto's is located just outside the Fabulous Freddie's on the SW corner or Ft. Apache and Charleston.  My suggestion, start getting gas and then go place your order.  Finish up your gas and then pick up your food.  Go home and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Roberts is located all over Las Vegas.  Being from Chicago we have lots of quick little Mexican restaurants all over the city and suburbs.  Roberts is a little taste of home right here in Vegas.  I've really only had a few things on the menu.    If you like tacos or burritos and carne Asada, this is your place.  This location in particular I frequent, because it's close to my house.  The service is typically quick but sometimes this location can get pretty slow which is why they don't have five stars.  Sometimes it gets very busy and they don't keep it the most clean.  With a lot of slobs that spill all over the place, I imagine it can get pretty hard to clean up after pigs all the time.  However the quality and taste of their food is what matters most.  As far as a taco shop and burrito joint, you can never go wrong with Robertos!"}
{"text":"Its not too busy whenever I go in. Steady traffic. My food has always been good,fresh and hot"}
{"text":"You know what would be nice to have in an order of nachos? Chips!  You know what else?  Cheese!  It seems like every time I order nachos here I get one less chip than the last time I ordered.  Well, guess what?  I'm not coming back anymore.  I'm sure you don't care, but maybe somebody will read this post and think about eating elsewhere.  Take my advice if you're looking for good nachos and avoid Roberto's."}
{"text":"This place could really use a number system when ordering food.  Countless times I see people walk out with someone else's order...seems like a simple fix."}
{"text":"Cleanest,  nicest,  best robertos in town. Food is consistently good. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Its Roberto's.   I wasn't expecting anything special or spectacular...I wanted something different from what I always get when I'm in a hurry...Del Taco, Jack in the Box...I was bored!  Stopped in about 6:45pm last night, got an order of nachos with no meat and no guac, and a burrito (don't remember what kind, it was for my fella.)  Service was polite, but not overly nice, and the food was prepared quickly.  We went home and ate, and it was exactly what I'd been craving.  Something tasty, and easy.    Could I make better nachos at home? Of course.  But for convenience, I'll eat at this location again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Robertos fan!  Food is great!  The only downfall...I'm from San Diego and nothing tastes better than the Robertos in Chula Vista!!!!"}
{"text":"So, I just left the store. I went through the drive through, as I normally had the past few times, and they failed across the board yet again.   Three months ago I went to this location and ordered what I typically do. Same order, every time. But instead, the lady at the drive thru window can hardly speak English and we go back and forth a few times and finally decide on \"Carne asada tacos, meat only, no guacamole and no Pico de gallo\". Needless to say, what I received was a handful of guacamole and a little bit of Carne asada. I go inside, keep in mind I went there because I wanted to utilize the drive thru and get back home where others were waiting on their food, and receive a ton of attitude and a sloppily made replacement pair of tacos. I said thank you, and didn't return for over a month.   Next month, almost the same occurrence happened, however this time, it was clear dialogue with a different lady. Ordered the two Carne asada tacos, meat only, and without disappointing, they still overloaded the tacos with guacamole..... But instead of just letting me down on the tacos, they went ahead and over loaded my three rolled tacos with guacamole. This time, I held up my receipt and handed them back their food through the window and asked them to correct it. They did, but this time the food was nicely made and the young lady opened it at the window and showed me the food as I ordered and made sure I was happy. Loved it and it made things right in the world, an honest mistake.   Fast forward to today, the first Lady was there again, and I not only sat outside the ordering spot with back and forth figuring out what clear spoken English means. But then when I finally get up to the window I'm there for 15 more minutes and was alright, well, hopefully they are making my food right now and I'll get fresh food. Nope. Cold Carne asada, but not only is the Carne asada Cold but the guacamole that is piled up on high, on top of the Carne asada, is cold as hell as well. The rolled tacos and the burrito are fantastic... But this will be my last time going back and forth with this lady, Last time going and getting disappointed by people that cannot check the order and cannot verify what I ordered. Last time.   Actually this will, unfortunately, be my last time going to robertos period. I'm sick of this. 12 bucks to get my food shit on. Yeah, I'll pass. Taco bell here I come. I'd rather pay the same for diarrhea that tastes good and is what I ordered. Rather than pay for food that I won't eat because it isn't what I ordered."}
{"text":"I love Robertos. They're always fast and have not had problems with the food. I always tip a couple bucks, but today was an exception. I ordered a carnitas burrito which was great. But when I payed at the drive thru, my order was 6.22, I didn't get any coins back so I thought the guy at the window just rounded up the change so he didn't have to count out the 88 cents, he actually rounded down and kept the 88 cents, as his tip?, I guess??  Before I realized what he'd done I was gonna give him 2 bucks for his trouble but not after I counted the bills. I won't be back to this location. I'm thinking it's pretty rude to assume a tip. It's basically stealing from a customer who would have otherwise been happy to express his appreciation for the service."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Roberto's but there are TWO meals that I recommend:  3 Rolled tacos- beef- w/guacamole & CARNE ASADA FRIES (minus the beans) from this location ONLY! So far they are the only ones I found who serve crinkly fries- which are my fave!"}
{"text":"I was here on Wednesday while waiting on my Samsung Galaxy phone being repaired at Wireless Doctor next door. Wednesday is 99 cent chicken taco day.  I was very happy after eating 3 tacos and it only cost me 3 dollars and some change."}
{"text":"We have been ordering takeout from Roberto's an average of twice a month over the past year, but never had as bad an experience as last night. For starters, they forgot the guac on our nachos order (we asked for it specifically, too). And the person taking the phone order barely understood English. I'm not a business owner, but if you have non-Spanish speaking customers, you may want to have a truly bilingual employee manning the phone for orders.  Next, they gave \"10 minutes\" as the pickup time. It takes 10 minutes to get there from our house; I waited another 10-15 for our food once I arrived. All this with no less than five employees behind the counter. Talk about overkill.   Needless to say, we're looking for another go to Mexican restaurant for our takeout nights.  Hopefully, this was just a bad night for Roberto's, although they certainly weren't busy at 7pm - not in the restaurant or the drive-thru."}
{"text":"The food is usually very good however tonight the service was horrible and the food was very subpar the young kid who looks like a young lineman was at the register taking care of all of his friends while other people waited for their food the young man served his friends.  I'm hoping to catch the owner when she is present so I can inform her of this ridiculous situation and I will no longer go to this location."}
{"text":"I Usually don't write bad reviews for a place but every time I go to this place they screw up my order Everytime. 4 times in the last few months and today was the last straw, my girlfriend and I ordered a really simple order a breakfast burrito and a carne asada burrito and when asked what kind of sauce we wanted we said green. simple right no way it could get screwed up right? Well when we got home we opened the bag and first thing we noticed was red sauce not green. Second we grabbed our burritos and start eating at first but of mine I no rice it was not right I said oh I must have taken yours because this is a breakfast burrito. She said no I have a breakfast burrito too, so what the had made me was also a breakfast burrito with some carne asada in it WTF. So if you want your order right stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 2.5 because it is really a 50/50 chance it will be good. There is no consistency from visit to visit. It will either be great or terrible. You'll either get a huge burrito or something slightly larger than a taquito. Good luck"}
{"text":"Bienvenidos a Ribertos taco shop! Its located in a strip mall. However, dont let that fool you. This place is so good! Carne asada burrito, which by the way, they make their own tortillas de harina.  Try for your self. U wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"The cashier over charged me for my food and when I brought the attention to her manager she was just as rude !!!! It's great she's there for her workers but she needs to learn how to listen to customer complaints without getting offended. I told her I wouldn't come back to this location and she laughed and said okay! Would not recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Got the burrito breakfast. They are fast and the food is so good. The place is clean and the staff is friendly too. It's a good fast food place to go to."}
{"text":"I hate this one. I notified the cashier that there was no green sauce and she 'sorry! Too busy!' while there was no one in line. She also wanted to charge me $7 for a meatless burrito, that at other locations charge me $5 for. Another woman asked for onions and cilantro on the side and cashier wanted to charge her $1!! This place is a rip off. They don't seem to care for customer service either."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos ever. This location is our favorite in the area.  Service is always quick, price is low."}
{"text":"We stopped in before going grocery shopping (we all know how bad of an idea it is to go shopping on an empty stomach), and it was quiet. The restaurant was dirty, and the fryer oil probably hasn't been changed in a month, or longer (it's in plain view from the counter where you order). The cucumber/carrot/onion/salsa bar was definitely on the sketchy side.   But I love me some dirty, sketchy holes in the wall.   I ordered the carnitas burrito, and I really liked it. The pork was flavorful, and abundant. The guacamole is standard guac (nothing to complain about or write home to mom about), but it adds good flavor.  The pico de gallo was in one spot in he middle of the burrito. I had to scoop some out because it was just too overpowering in that one spot. But, overall, it was a good burro.   Will I go there again? Maybe.  We'll see if I'm hungry the next time I go grocery shopping."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm finally got to try  Robert O's and it was delicious! Couldn't  decide what to order off the menu because everything looked amazing     . Excellent guacamole!  Service was quick and food was delicious .   I like that you can grab limes and other toppings to place on your food . Sounds weird but the mtn dew was excellent lol. Server was nice. We  will definitely   return to try many other things .   We got the chili rellenos and rolled chicken tacos and a massive cheese quesadilla. Refried beans were very tasty. Tons of cheese atop the rolled tacos   .  No complaints!"}
{"text":"We usually come here later in the evening so the drive thru is really hit or miss. Sometimes you may spend 3 minutes or sometimes up to 15 (they get busy). They're usually nice when we get to the window. A few of them actually recognize my husband when he pulls up which is nice. Food is usually the same, tastes good. We usually get the carne asada nachos and carne asada burrito (it doesn't come with the fixings - guac, pico, etc) I LOVE their horchata too!"}
{"text":"There's nothing bad to say about this place! Yumm yummy!! I always get the #14 but everything is Delish! Everything!!"}
{"text":"I practically grew up in San Diego so I'm Very Familiar with Roberto's. This location is one of the best in town. They're pretty consistent with their food, and that's really important for me. If I had one negative thing to say, the Rolled Tacos are a bit different from the ones I remember having in San Diego, and I don't know what it is, but that doesn't stop me from ordering them still. I love the Chicken Burrito, the stewed chicken is delicious. I recently tried the Beef, not the Carne Asada but the Stewed Shredded Beef is really good, but of course their Carne Asada is still a classic! I also recently tried their Taco Salad Special which is a great value for the amount of food you get, plus a drink. But if you catch their Daily Specials, then you are definitely getting the Best Bang for your Buck! Mondays is Chicken Burrito Combo day, Tuesdays is Big Breakfast Burrito day, try the Chorizo! Wednesdays is $.99 Tacos! Plus they have tons of Everyday Values to choose from. Pretty much you can't go wrong if you're Craving Mexican Food! And if it's 3am and you've got the Munchies then you're in luck because they are Open! Also for my NorCal friends, the California Burrito is no where near the same or close to the Burritos we are used to, these ones have Potatoes inside, pretty much all the Burritos here just have only meat; the Rice, Beans, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Sour Cream, Cheese, and Guacamole are All Extra! So don't make the mistake of ordering their California Burrito and thinking you are getting a Mission-Style NorCal Burrito. I pretty much add the extras which come pretty close to the price of the burritos you would pay in NorCal anyways. Now you may be wondering why I would say I practically grew up in SD but know a lot about NorCal, I'm originally from SanFran, but have relatives in SD and spent my Summer and Spring Breaks in SD and for a time Lived in SD at the Golden Triangle, where my closest Roberto's was on Miramar, Yup, near Top Gun! \"I feel the Need, the Need for some Yummy Mexican Food!\" Haha, I'm so Corny!"}
{"text":"My morning hunger pains were gnawing at me and suddenly the idea of a breakfast burrito sounded marvelous. Located right across UNLV, Roberto's was an easy pick for a to-go breakfast. Service here was a bit iffy - the three guys working behind the counter hem hawed around and took their sweet time making orders. The breakfast burrito came with eggs, potato, cheese, and refried beans. With the $0.50 card fee, my breakfast came to a little over $6. If you ask me, that's a bit outrageous. My local taco shop charges less than $4. What gives? Taste wise, it was alright but at least the serving size was huge. I don't think I'll return here anytime soon.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #65"}
{"text":"First, let me just start off by saying that Roberto's is not my favorite Taco Shop. I eat at Roberto's only when it's past midnight and after my friends and I have had a night out on the town. Roberto's greasy food is just what the doctor ordered after you've had your fill of drinks. Roberto's Taco Shop also happens to be conveniently located next to where I live. I usually order the combo quesadilla meal, which at $4.55, is a no-brainer choice because it's 1) cheap and 2) hard to mess up a quesadilla. The quesadilla is loaded with cheese and dripping with grease, which is fine by me in the wee hours of the morning. The beans and rice served with the quesadilla are average.     Here's why I'm giving Roberto's Taco Shop 3 stars even though I think their food is less than stellar:  1. Affordable prices 2. Food is brought out quickly 3. Open 24/7 4. You can eat your food in peace and quiet at 2AM at a sit-down fast-food restaurant 5. Located throughout Vegas   Customer service is minimal, but I don't expect anyone to be perky at 2AM. I would say I'm a regular at Roberto's, but it's due to the fact that it's convenient, not out of love for the shop's food. In sum, Roberto's is a no-frill Taco Shop with average food, but it's a quick and easy option that everyone can agree on eating at before hitting the sack."}
{"text":"Ok you're drunk out of your mind and have the munchies. You don't really care about eating healthy considering the amount of carbs and calories you just consumed with that last shot of Jameson's or that 24 pack of pabst blue. Where should you go? Well considering that there is one designated driver in your group or at least still have the ability to stand and walk, you should definitely give this place a try.   Roberto's Taco Shop is essentially what it is. A hole in the wall Taco shop with chains of stores spread across the valley to help hungry people get their Mexican fix. With its staff of Spanish speaking staff also fluent in understanding the ramblings and slurred speech of people who have had way to much to drink. They'll work to the best of their abilities to serve you good Mexican food. You want chorizo, they got chorizo? You want carne asada? They have carne asada? Whatever Mexican cuisine you want they mostly likely have. However I do recommend that you order the carne asada nachos or fries. Super delicious and will definitely make the perfect last meal since its fatty content has to almost guarantee you a heart attack. It's cheap and it'll get you full."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Won't listen to your order then when correcting, they do not want to change it because they are making it.. WTF!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting the bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the inside. (yes, that's exactly how I order it) its like 3 dollars and it fills you up. If you're on a greasy cheesy unhealthy kick then do it up! This location isn't as \"cozy\" as other locations I guess and the workers are real stoic but it's real quiet and relaxing."}
{"text":"My company started treating us to $1.00 chicken tacos on Wednesdays and the Roberto's on Las Vegas Blvd S. *near the Outlet Mall has been AMAZING!!!!  On a few occasions we ordered as many as 100 tacos and the team prepared them to the utmost quality and with a SMILE on their faces!  Sometimes on the Wednesday Special ***$1.00 dollar tacos***they have a line that goes thru the restaurant and all the way OUT THE DOOR.....AND this crew never stresses or quits providing the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  if you want a great lunch for your business office with an extremely low price...hit up Roberto's at the Outlet Mall!!!  They are the VERY BEST!!!  James Roth II, Solar City, Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a chain thats been popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. What do they serve? Good cheap mexican food. The burritos here are a little different from the ones I had back in Cali. Usually I'm used to having rice and beans in my burrito but the ones here only come with meat, sour cream, guac, and some pico di gallo... Not that I'm complaining or anything. What I usually end up getting is either the Carne Asada Nachos or the Carnitas Burrito. They have a huge menu with tons of other things but I stay loyal to my choices. Another thing thats good about this place is the consistency. I've eaten at Baha Fresh several times and each time its pretty hit or miss. Roberto's is guaranteed to fill you up and/or give you some comfort food to cure your hangover.  So the next time you're hankering for some good cheap mexican food at 5am after a night of drinking and partying... GO TO ROBERTO'S! The kicker? You can go there when your not drunk either and its still good!  Check out the picture I posted. I guarantee it will make you HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"It wasn't all that! Friends got taquitos and they were pure tortillas and I got a burrito and it was way too greasy"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries is my favorite it's a huge portion and it's so flavorful and yummy. I also like there quesadilla and tortas. It's convenient that there open 24/7 and the place is clean and the workers are so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Probably the worst location in town. Next to the one by UNLV since my friend was shot at there. This location is CONSTANTLY disgusting. And somehow always packed. Cashiers are always rude. Only upside is that it's close to my house and I once accidentally got a free drink. Oh, but HOW DOES A COMBO not come with a drink????? Seriously, that's a chain-wide issue. Combos everywhere come with drinks."}
{"text":"I will not be caught in this place alone ordering past 8 pm. The strip mall where it's located is a bit dubious. The restaurant itself is dark and dingy. Their salsa station always looks messy.Talking to the cashier on night shift is like talking to a robot. No attempt at customer service whatsoever. There are so many things they can improve upon.   It's a shame because their tacos are decent with enough flavor and spices to hit the spot. This place is also open 24/7! From where I live, this is closer than having to venture out to downtown/strip to Tacos El Gordo. So if I have a taco craving, Roberto's can *sometimes* suffice, especially when pressed for time. I just order their adobada, carne asada, and fish tacos."}
{"text":"Out of all the Roberto's in the Las Vegas area, this by far is the best.  - Cleanest  - Freshest  - Nicest - Most spacious  - Even during peak times, 6-8pm, still not that bad of a wait  - Usually order on the phone. Food ready in 10min. Great service.  - Salsa bar packed. If not, friendly enough to restock - Even on Chicken taco Wednesdays, not sloppy.  - I wouldn't go out of my way to just to visit this particular location when you have one right next to where you live, but I feel this place deserves merits."}
{"text":"I had the Monday chicken burrito special and carne asada fries for 13.   - Great chicken burrito deal. A regular drink cost almost 2 bucks so we just got the meal for 4. Also comes with rice and beans.  - carne asada fries are crispy. similar to molca-salsa but without the nacho cheese and more expense. - filthy. when i entered, i felt like i needed to take a shower. bathroom has graffiti everywhere. seating are uncleaned.  - free refills for horchata! no fee like socal! :) - they have specials on tuesday and wednesday. I may come back to try it, especially their breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Giving a chain 4 stars??? A taco place??? Fast food??? Really???  Well, yes. Why not? I only get items that I've tried and tested: chicken chimichanga, chicken taco salad, carne Asada quesadilla and horchata.  It's a convenient place to get food from. Next to a gas station by my gym. They're open 24hrs and they have a drive-thru. The food is inexpensive.   When I think of Mexican food, I think about lard, salty fried fatty food, sour cream and mushy beans. But you don't necessarily need to get all that if you don't want to. I'm very specific with my order (no beans, no sour cream, with guacamole) and they've never screwed up my order. The chicken pieces in the taco salad are huuuuge and juicy. They don't skimp on the protein here.  I'm not a fan of soda or sugary drinks but every once in a while, I do crave for some horchata. I trick my lactose-intolerant self to think it's kind of like cinnamon-y milk."}
{"text":"Worst Robert's I've eaten at in Vegas ordered three items all items very little meat and 3 to four times the onions and green peppers the meat that was there was placed on the ends of the two machacca burritos and the chicken enchiladas I ordered the burritos had very little egg also. Basically I paid for onions and green peppers with a hint of meat in all three items.  I eat at Robertos all over town so far this one is the worst."}
{"text":"You can always tell if it's going to be good Mexican food if the refried beans and rice is good... They were some of the best I've ever eaten! There red enchilada sauce was dynamite!! Some of the best Mexican food I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Hangover cure for sure. Nothing tastes better when you've been drinking. Never have to wait more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this place doesn't offer much for me.  The bean and cheese burrito is pretty good - but I could make that at home, so, why did I come here?  I guess if you're in a hurry at 4 in the morning and want a burrito, this is your place.  But, me?  Not my favorite."}
{"text":"Ugh I don't usually write a review but I'm so disappointed. Ordered rolled tacos and got a chicken tostada instead, seems workers get confused from their #7 and #8 went home to realized there was a tostada in place of tacos. Went back (20mon commute) only to find staff blaming each other and not offering proper costumer service and compensation for waste of time....."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos were da' bomb according to the wife. Hi lite for us where their tasty tortillas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible I mean seriously what fucking idiot shoves 8+ chicken tacos in one box!!! Fuck you and tour broken ass chicken tacos putos"}
{"text":"Roberto's has my heart! I don't know why they have so many negative reviews (disclosure: I've only had their carne asada) but that's because it is the BOMB! Their tortillas are honestly some of the best; they almost feel home made! The carne asada fries are also off the hook!! Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, I bet you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"So I ate here with some co-workers and I order the a burrito and fish tacos. The burrito was okay but the fish taco was a fish stick with lettuce, I was expecting something different considering the fact I never had fish tacos until recently at this establishment. My fault I guess."}
{"text":"If you decide to eat at Roberto's Mexican Food, stay away from the Milanesa Torta. It's basically a thin leathery breaded beef steak that tastes like old burnt beef jerky that may have been refried and then microwaved about 5 times. YUCK! And a $1.10 extra if I want sour cream added on my nacho chips? C'mon!"}
{"text":"In a drunken stupor finding the flashing 24 hrs Robertos sign is a sign from above. Fast and tasty burritos with fresh non salty guacamole."}
{"text":"It definitely was an entertaining visit at this location.  When it was our time to order, the cashier made us wait as he was right in front of us calling the Subway next door placing his order because, just like us, he was hungry. At some point he said he didn't want to be here. He talked back to the customers. The salsa bar was a complete disaster (cups in the salsa, and salsa all over the bar).  About the only good thing about this place is that the food comes up quick, but to no avail since it sits in the window for about five mins before he called out the numbers. The food itself was okay to say the least but not much to expect from a taco shop. We definitely did have some chucks and giggles."}
{"text":"This the first time I have eaten at a Roberto's.  If the food at this Sam's Town location is the same menu at all the other locations, then I definitely won't be back.  Very bland and lackluster Mexican food."}
{"text":"wow okay so this restaurant is so boring looking inside and it doesn't look special or delicious or exotic or fancy or any of those interesting things but let me tell you that you have no idea what you are talking about because this place has taquitos that are very delicious and they put guacamole on top and also they have meat inside and they are crispy like wood chips but they are edible and also greasy and i mean they definitely are not good for you but if you can get past that mental roadblock then you will understand how important these things are and i am sure you can just go to the gym for a little longer or skip having a heavy meal later on or if you are a normal person then you will just go about your day because it is not that big of a deal and no one will think differently of you if you gained a few pounds and if they do then they do not understand the magic of a nice greasy wood chip with guacamole and they also have carne asada fries but those are dangerous because you try to get them and you tell yourself that you will eat half now and have the rest later and it's actually a great idea because you can get two meals at once but it is not two meals it is one meal and you are a fool to think otherwise and i was a fool once too so i am an expert of how a fool thinks do not be a fool just enjoy your life"}
{"text":"Good late night spot when you are in a rush I live around the corner so I'm always we there when I need something quick to eat late at night"}
{"text":"We used to love this place and order takeout at least 1-2 times a week. However, a few month ago something happened to this place, they either changed the cook, or the whole crew, but the quality is just not the same. Every other time the nachos are burned, and the burritos have more fat knots than meat. But the last drop was when I found a piece of plastic film INSIDE my food. I'm sorry, but that's too much. I'm all for loyalty and giving second chances, but come on. The only reason I put 2 stars (I know I ought to put 1) is I hope that some changes can be made and this place can be restored to its former quality level. It's a shame to see your favorite spots turn like that."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst location I've ever been to. I switched to the hualapai location after too many poor experiences at this Charleston (shell) location, but tonight was reminded why I dislike this one so much when the bf picked up food from here. The rolled tacos are lacking in meat and poorly made (nearly every one of the dozen times I've ordered it here), they hardly put any guacamole on the food, and tonight they actually melted cheese over guacamole making for a goopy, warm, weird consistency of melted cheese and guacamole. There are many other complaints, but I don't want to get going. If you want Robertos in the Summerlin area I would drive to the hualapai location, only 2 miles away from this one. And it has a drive thru too!"}
{"text":"My husband  and I was in the neighborhood and yelp Mexican food, we came because of the carne Asada fries, it was good but for some reason it felt like a big container of calories. The fries were kind of undercooked.  They could have been crispier.  The carnitas burrito was ok but the rolled tacos was the best.  I probably get that if we go back.  My husband wanted the Tuesday special which was a breakfast burrito for 2.99 but he didn't want bacon egg and potatoes so he ordered the carnitas burrito.  The place did not really have a place to eat besides a few tables outside and it was a windy day so we took the food home with us.  This was something I wouldn't go back to but my husband may win on this one.  I think it was just ok \"when it touches my lip it is sooo good\" that didnt happen to me.  My husband loves all good Mexican food especially if he get good gas later, lol."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for rolled tacos in any other place we would call it taquitos.  We got the special 12 for 9.99 it was perfect for the three of us!!  We have gone to other locations and had the nachos and burritos all good you can't go wrong with Mexican food here.   We went during lunch time and there was a little league team it brought back some fond memories.   There wasn't anywhere to eat but we took out so it was okay."}
{"text":"The rolled tacos were okay it's not home made tortillas and the guacamole was like a bright green kind of a strange color. The french fries was generous but it was oily and not very crispy. I like them better before"}
{"text":"Im rating this location only. I've been to a number of Roberto's in Vegas this one is not great. If you like going to a taco shop and being stared at as you wait for your food this is your place. I ordered my usual Roberto's... Bean and cheese burrito and tamales. I was highly disappointed! The cheese on the bean and cheese was overwhelming. There was more cheese then beans and it was in one big clump. The tamales were decent but were kind of dry and hard/over cooked.   I usually get a cup so I can get water well apparently this place doesn't believe in water because they have no water button on their fountain thing. The guys behind the counter were gawking so uncomfortably I was very relieved when my food finally came up. I probably won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I have not been to Roberto's in a very long time. This is pretty close to my house and the workers wanted this for their lunch so I decided to hit it up.  I love that you can call ahead and place your order. It is so much faster than waiting around at the gas station. I had a very large order and they got everything right. No screw ups, I was shocked.  You can't go wrong with the #1 ( shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w/ beans and rice) or the carne asada burritos. Those burritos are huge and oh so good.  Don't forget the salsa and bag of carrots and peppers before you leave. You can't eat a Roberto's meal without those."}
{"text":"Yes-- I am giving this Roberto's 5 stars. It is a fairly new location and it is super clean. I walked in and was greeted by the staff. Everyone was very nice and they were all working. Not a single person just standing around.   I ordered a shredded beef taco and a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. It came out very fast and could not be fresher. The salsa bar was clean and stocked. I got my order to go and it was still hot when I got home.   This is a really good Roberto's compared to some of the other locations in town. Oh and another plus is that they have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Really delicious Mexican food, huge portions... Not health or diet food... But delicious!"}
{"text":"The food came out delicious, hot, fresh and didnt have to wait long. The price is decent and the portions are good. Definitely a nice small place for a quick bite. I wish I could have left tip on the card but they dont have that option."}
{"text":"Why is Roberto's such a favorite for late night munchies? It could be that all of their fried items are done so in lard. I was happy for my friend who has a soy allergy because she does not have to worry about dying. At least not from coming in contact with her allergen. The same cannot be said from a possible heart attack.  I cannot resist the rolled tacos. They are a comfort food that is slathered in guacamole and topped with a generous amount of shredded cheese. The prices are comparable to other fast food Mexican. Plus there is an added bonus of it being 24 hours."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Roberto's and go quite often. We always get the same thing, carne asada fries. It's usually good although the past couple times we've eaten here haven't been very good. We usually eat inside and it's usually not very clean there's always a table or two that's sitting with food on it or crumbs and what not on the floor. Which really doesn't bother us too much we just sit at a clean table but lately it's been too much. The staff is never too friendly.  The last time we ate here I actually got a carne asada quesadilla and the meat was very fatty and some pieces looked like they weren't cooked all the way. It made the meal unappetizing and I didn't finish it. We took it home otherwise I would've asked for a new one. Today we went and got fries and they were pretty good but towards the end I get a fork full and right before I take the bite I noticed a long piece of hair tangled literally around the meat. I took it to the cashier and showed her and even she was disgusted. She tried pulling the hair out and the meat came with it dangling from it. It was disgusting and the fact that we basically already ate all the fries was even more gross to think about. It was taken care of but I won't be returning. This place just keeps going downhill."}
{"text":"This place food was disgusting, the chicken was bad and I mean really spoiled. Granted we went in at 3:30 am and no we're weren't drinking I drive a truck and just arrived in Vegas.  The green salsa had no taste and was super watery.  Nothing had flavor and was greasy tasting taco shells.  My first and last experience with Roberto's"}
{"text":"Tried 2 restos on Rainbow and the Robertos on Commerce in N. Las Vegas. So funny how all 3 restos are very different in taste considering they are owned by the same person. My fave location has got to be Robertos on Commerce on North LV. Their carne asada is so delish! Seasonings on point. Their Carne Asada Burrito and Nachos are always hot and fresh and just so tasty. Their red hot sauce is thick and super hot the way I like it. Employees are nice and obviously are great cooks"}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I head to Vegas this is our first stop. Everything on the menu is good and fresh. Customer service is good and the restaurant is clean...."}
{"text":"The Chichen Tacos were outstanding!  The staff are always friendly and  are quick with our meal.   Good Food and Good Service makes for a good timer out!  If only these guys could cook Asian food!  We don't have a good Asian place to eat at here in Southern Highlands!"}
{"text":"This is a place I heard about from many locals and I finally got a chance to check out one. I'm not really a fan of Mexican food, but their chicken taco was something else! I wish there were Roberto's in Seattle...but then it would probably taste like Taco Bell. In any case, the next time I'm in Vegas I'll be eating here more often.  Service was polite and quick, bathrooms were clean. It's all I ask."}
{"text":"My go to spot when I'm angry at my tummy.  I mean this in the nicest way possible.   \"What's that you say?  You need more veggies?\"   as I take another bite of my California burrito stuffed to the absolute limit with steak, cheese, and potatoes.  As it's pleading for help I add to it with a heaping forkful of Carne Asada fries and wash it down with whatever alcoholic beverage I might be indulging myself with that evening (early morning?)  Great for drive homes where it's 3 am and you're trying to remember when the last time you ate was and what kind of food you might have available when you'll wake up and dont want to move.    My list of recommended food: 1.  California burrito (steak, cheese, fries.   3 essentials to late night dining) 2.  Machaca Burrito (Shredded beef, eggs.  Breakfast OR Dinner.  Or Both.  HAVE YOUR PREFERRED HOT SAUCE ON HAND before ordering) 3.  Carne Asada Fries (you can't ever get enough fries, cheese and steak) 4.  Carnitas Burrito/Carnitas Plate (when you're sick of gut busting steak and instead want gut busting pork) 5.  Adobada Burrito/Carne Asada Burrito/Chorizo Burrito (eenie, meenie..)  You really can't go wrong IMO, though I personally am not a fan of their chicken overall, and I tried the Flying Saucer on a whim because it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I expected them to hand over the keys to the store based on the other menu items' relative value, and instead it was just some disappointing tostada thing."}
{"text":"Overall this place is really good. I like the burritos and have tried most things on the menu. The only complaint I have is the selection of sauces for the food. They have the typical red/green sauce which both are not even slightly hot, salty, tasty and honestly just add some sort of wetness to a dry burrito. I will say hands down my favorite item is the beef taco bowls. They cook the bowls fresh and they use a nice thick shredded beef which is plentiful. I also really enjoy the menudo which is only served on weekends and is first come. I will say that sometimes when I get a container to go, about 50% of the time there is a huge bone with fat on it which takes up a good portion if the container. Also the menudo does not contain hominy and they don't offer it at all. The restaurant is clean and has nice seating area if you are eating in and the staff speaks English well enough that your order is easy. I will say that anything that involves beef tongue has a weird taste. I have tried that multiple times and maybe it's the way it's cooked but it does not taste as good as other places I have tried. Overall good prices and a great place to get a bite."}
{"text":"Im sitting in here for 30 mins waiting for my order. There are EIGHT customers sitting here ahead of me. They have one person cooking and one person working the register and its totally backed up. Maybe by the year 2050 I will actually get my food.  Several of the customers have already gotten up and walked out.  Service = 0 stars"}
{"text":"At 9am I already knew I was going to have a kick ass day - because I kicked it off with a breakfast burrito from Robertos for only $5! It was that good. It was a fiesta in my mouth...which I've been told is a dirty saying but I mean it to describe how good the burrito was :)"}
{"text":"Tall female who was gonna take my order made me feel as if i was taking up her time lol nobody is here and it says open 24 hours..... never coming here again reviewers arnt lying...... didn't get a chance to taste food but wouldn't give me money to this place with this kind of service . Literally took off after a few simple questions that I asked . I'm totally sober and have a full car of my family who was hungry after a long trip.... keep in mind I'm really damn patient......"}
{"text":"For a chain Mexican restaurant known for being a hole in the wall standard, this place elevates the usual robertos dining experience. Yes it's in a gas station but it's huge! 8 tables with 5 of those tables seating 6 people is larger than any previous robertos that I've been to. I like to come on Wednesdays for 99 cent chicken tacos. The dining room is clean and the service has always been friendly. The food has always been exactly as I ordered and expected it to be."}
{"text":"This taco shop is close to my house and delicious! I like getting their carne Asada burrito and fries... But believe their menu is good. The only issue I have with this place is there are homeless people coming up to your car asking for money... The funny thing is if the cashier spots it she will yell through the intercom \"leave my customers alone\" overall quick and convenient Mexican food."}
{"text":"Drive thru is terrible. You are rushed the entire time, even if you are the only customer at 10 o'clock at night.   The lady had no manners or any sort of restaurant (fast food) professionalism. While ordering she interrupts you with your total. I had asked for a specific item and it seemed as if she was in a rush to hurry and say \"no\". There was no entry and exit greeting as you pull up the window.    As far as the food, I am disappointed. Putting aside the horrible customer service, the Carne Asada meat is too heavily seasoned, the spanish rice is also the same, and the burrito is wrapped as if it were done carelessly. I could wrap a burrito tighter then this with my eyes closed.   Worse Roberto's I have ever been to thus far."}
{"text":"This is me and my dad's #1 stop! We're always getting grade A food when we come to Roberto's Tacos. Not only that but the service is amazing! Everybody seems friendly and they remember your orders when you become a regular! This place truly deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"1 star for being open 24 hrs and 1 star for not making a greasy cheese quesadilla. But my fish taco had to be the saddest, tasteless fish taco I've ever received at a Roberto's! Haha, and I've been to plenty over the years being from San Diego....I'm still shaking my head.... lol. Fish sticks, smh...ya'll are lazy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Robertos location. Drivr thu is fast and the food is always good.. After tying out the location by our new house over on sunset and mountain vista a few times, if I want Robertos I just drive to the Boulder location."}
{"text":"Have to say the new lady that's works graveyard at drive thru is a idiot for starters 2 nights in a row she gets my order wrong and not to mention instead of handing me my large drinks she put it in the bag with my food she then hands the bag to me ...I say my drink is in the bag she was so ashamed she told me sry and closed the window  and walked away lmao ...the old workers were better"}
{"text":"Decent spot. Not like the taco shops in SoCal. Price is decent. Crunchy tacos are good. The California burrito lacks flavor. The hot sauce is not flavorful either and is only mildly spicey. The service is always good. The restaurant is fairly clean which is a huge plus. Best part about it is that it's open 24/7"}
{"text":"Food Is great  Service is great just dont order over the phone. They will wait until u get there to start to prepare ypur meal. Why have phone orders than?!"}
{"text":"I definitely can't complain about their chicken tacos  but the green onion is always bad I'm never going to that location because the green onions are part of my favorite part of eating there. Not going to that location anymore."}
{"text":"Wednesday $1 tacos. Tortillas tacos are deep fried so they cone out very crispy. Must eat them asap otherwise they get stale. Chicken is shredded and very lean which btw they are not cheap with their chicken. Two have me pretty happy, three have me full.   Breakfast burritos are pretty hefty and tasty. Again, eat right away."}
{"text":"We stopped in here expecting a little dive Mexican place, but DANG! Soooo good. I got carne asada nachos, which were incredible. My mom got a machaca burrito, which she said was the best of her life. And my dad got a ham breakfast burrito, which he loved. They were fast, kind, and super helpful. The store was clean, and in the 30 minutes we were there, they were busy and kept on top of it so well. I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food.  Almost as good as my kitchen. ;)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but I have been twice and both times I was not really happy with the food. The service was great and food was done quick but it really did not have much flavor. The plus side is that this spot is open 24 hours so if you just have to eat something then this could be an option but with the many options of Mexican food spots, I feel like I'd probably not come here too often."}
{"text":"Decent location, has a drive through if you're really not wanting to get out of the car, but it takes forever! So I don't recommend it unless it's 1am and you're in your PJs and bunny slippers."}
{"text":"I was starving and had a plate with shrimp in marina sauce, yellow rice with mushy red beans, half an avocado, shredded lettuce, 2 slices of tomato and corn tortilla. The tortillas were warm so I ate it with my dish. The shrimp was drowned in way too much sauce so that made it more on the salty side. The yellow rice texture was not similar to my previous yellow rice experience - it was sort of gritty. I think the best part of this dish was when I drained the sauce and mixed it with the avocado and the veggies.   Food service was fast. I had the food to go and they didn't provide utensils."}
{"text":"Cheapest Mexican breakfast in town!!!  Great food and ok service.  The one on Gibson is the best in my book."}
{"text":"Grabbed Roberto's the other night for dinner... Much to my disappointment the California burrito no longer comes with guac or sour cream! If it doesn't have at least one of those ingredients than it's not a California burrito you penny pinching cheap b^$+ards!  No thank you, never again. There are way too many better options for similar prices."}
{"text":"Every time we go it gets worse... Barely any steak in my California Burrito along with a tiny amount of pico and soggy fries."}
{"text":"Carne asada nachos....... $6!!!    Carne asada torta... $6  !!!! Horchata..... $3  ALL THAT AFTER DRINKING THE NIGHT AWAY...... CHACHING!!!  Oh damn.... dont forget carnitas burrito... Damn Im gettin hungry"}
{"text":"Now I've been to lots of Roberto's Taco Shops. The staff at this location hands down have been the best.  Restaurant and bathrooms are always clean.  They are quick to sevre you and quick getting the food out right the first time.    Come visit this location, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Robertos! Quick, easy and tasty! Try the carne asada it's delicious! Great rice and beans too! My hubby likes the Chili rellano burrito, chicken tacos and the Colorado burrito!"}
{"text":"Well I found a toothpick in my food. This place usually satisfies but I'm done now. Good riddance Roberto's tacos. Not to mention my horchata was disgusting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Roberto's. The carne asada and chicken burritos come filled with meat! Wednesdays offer 99¢ chicken tacos and sometimes they'll throw in an extra taco! The lady behind the counter is very friendly and always greets you! I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Roberto's is Roberto's. But this Roberto's always looks horrible. Never clean. All tables are always covered with crap. But I guess that's how it is lol."}
{"text":"This place does it right! Easy to order blazing fast service and Simply amazing food. The prices are cheap and the portion are gigantic! The fried tacos are a must. The chicken burrito is a must... The carne asada steak nachos I saw was the size of a brief case! The salsa they have to take To-go is phenomenal. I am so glad this location was closer to the casino. The place is a must return for me when I return. When you build a location in Oklahoma City let me know!!!  Thank you for being awesome! Respectfully, Bryan Oklahoma City."}
{"text":"This Roberts prices are higher than other one but I was okay with that since it is in henderson . However , it's pretty darn dirty. Not sure if it's just an off day for the workers here or what. But I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Loved the chicken burrito, carne asada quesadilla, and carne asada burrito. Pretty reasonable prices and quick service. Would stop by again!"}
{"text":"Having lived in San Diego for awhile, I know all about the \"Bertos\".  There's a billion of these types of Mexican food places in San Diego: Adalberto's, Himiberto's, Wookieeberto's, Ernie and Berto's....  Okay, so the last two I made up, but there's still a billion Berto's variants in San Diego.  \"But what about my experience in Vegas\", you ask?  I'm getting to that.  After a night of drinking, I stopped by Roberto's in the Sinclair gas station.  It's the same stuff.  The same blessed stuff as I'd find in San Diego.  And the rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole are just as good.  So is this food merely tasty only with the extra alcoholic kick?  I couldn't help myself.  After being reminded about how enjoyable the flavor was, I went back without drinkage, and still just as good.  The food is value priced, tasty, and consistently dependable, right down to the little salsa bar.  It's not gas station fare.  It just happens to be located inside the gas station.  Don't let the setting scare you off.  It's not life changing, but it is good fast food, and a nice continuations of one of my old late-night traditions that has carried over to my new hometown.  But after a late night of socializing, there's not much better that hits the spot."}
{"text":"I hate that all robertos are different. I asked for chips with cheese and for them to put chorizo on and just charge me for nachos which I always get when I actually go inside. She straight up said no. I have no idea why. You're making money off of me. Wouldn't even let me just buy some chorizo. You make your food as people order. I would understand if it was pre made .. But come on"}
{"text":"So I went ordered serveral food items with a horchata well unfortunately the machine was out so instead of say I'm sorry we are unfortunately out right now it's gonna be few min. to make it did you still want it or no they 1 younger girl went to the back and I'm what they did or whipped up but came back and have me a drink which looked off so I took 1 tiny sip and was horrible I told they lady that brought me the drink and I told her this tasted horrible and she said \"oh I didn't make it\" so I told her can I just get my money back for the drink they looked confused and started speaking in Spanish and then ask me if I wanted to try another one they just made I said no and said it's okay jus out the drink credit towards another burrito and I'll pay the difference so she said ok 4 more dollars I said ok and the whole time they were jus starring and like chit chating in Spanish like if they were talking trash I purchased over 44 dollars worth of food and left tip and this is how your gonna treat your customers ....very very disappointing and I will not be gonna back ever to that location or any Robert is for quite some time I believe their food is pretty good but workers their all lack the courtesy and this goes with several other locations if your not happy where you work go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a Las Vegas favorite. Ask anyone from Vegas and they will tell you that they love Roberto's. This is likely why they have so many locations. Roberto's is the perfect cheap late night indulgence. The portions are absolutely huge and the food its self is to die for, at least if  you like casual Mexican fare. Its not the nicest or even cleanest looking place but once you have eaten the food you don't care. This place is so popular that its hard for them to keep up with the wear and tear that comes with being the neighborhoods favorite.   They have an awesome little salsa bar that includes things like pickled carrots, radish, cucumbers, whole peppers, and a variety of house salsas that sit next to plastic bags and cups because they know you want to take a lot of it home with you. They are ok with that, this is not a place where the restrained come to dine. This establishment is where everyone goes after they leave the bar early in the morning to get some greasy food before passing out. Its where the college kids go to get two days worth of food for cheap. Put simply- Roberto's is a Las Vegas institution and taco tradition as beloved as the city it's self."}
{"text":"This place is too over priced to not get orders correct and for it taste so bad. Roberto's taco shop are the absolute worst in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me! Well they have fooled me for the last time. In addition to the tacos being overpriced, this particular location has zero customer service. I can call the order in and it still will not be ready once I get to the restaurant. Also the quality of the food is left to be desired. The below picture is the 2nd taco out of the four I ordered that had a crack shell once I unwrapped it. I know you thinking that a cracked shell is not a big deal...well it is a big deal when the tacos are deep fried. The crack shell results in the already cooked chicken being hard and inedible due to being cooked even longer.  Definitely taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Like a previous reviewer said, If you've lived in Vegas and had any kind of a social night life, you've probably called on Senor Roberto to bail you out of some late night hunger spots.  This is probably also the case if you've done anything in So. Cal past midnight.  This Taco shop is nothing like a Bay Area taqueria, I liken Roberto's/Alberto's/Jilbertos/Ralberto's to Mexican fast food.  Though it may not be the most authentic, it's usually greasy, unhealthy but devastatingly delicious.  Carne Asada burritos, chips and fries from So. Cal are the stuff of legend amongst my friends.  Prices here have gone up a bit compared to when I was last in So Cal, but the large portions, delicious Carne Asada and late night hours (24h) all remain.  The Carne Asada Burritos here, come with only carne asada, sour cream, guacamole, and pico, no rice or beans.  The carne asada fries, come in a Styrofoam container filled with fries, then guacamole, sour cream, pico, carne asada and cheese dumped on top.  Unreal, and unreal that I have yet to find a place in the Bay area that can do the same properly.  They have a green and red salsa (both good) along with some pickled carrots, radishes and jalapenos in their salsa bar.  And they also accept credit card.  If you are in Vegas looking for late night eats, seek out Roberto's, there are like 30 locations."}
{"text":"Carne asda burrito, the staple of my Roberto's eating, they really do make a good one, just as long as the meat is cooked fresh. They do have a nasty habit of cooking the meat in batches, then leaving it in a pot to stay arm, this results in dried out meat, so just keep an eye on it.  The one thing these guys do badly is the carne asda fries, the premise is great junk food, fries, carne asda meat, all the toppings, but they never seam to be able to cook the fries, they are always almost raw, which results in me having to have them made again...."}
{"text":"When it first opened it was great! But as of late the quality and quantity of the food is lacking. This evening I had a burrito al pastor and the meat wasn't freshly cooked and barley warm not  mention the girl behind the counter has a sour look on her face."}
{"text":"Easily the worst location , the food is much better at the other ones. Chicken is dry a lot of the time, the chips have never been fresh, food just has a lower quality taste compared to other locations."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food Mexican restaurant!!  The dishes I normally get is the rolled tacos plate (chicken) or the chorizo plate with flower tortillas!! Deelish!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here maybe three or four times and I usually get the beef taco plate which comes with Spanish rice and refried beans. The food is decent especially at 3 AM.   We've never been inside, only gone through the drive-thru which moves pretty quickly.  Every time I drive by I always see a line which I believe is a good thing for a restaurant to have."}
{"text":"Usually I love robertos this one is disappointing.  No meat in anything.  We got Chimichanga and there was hardly any beef in it carne asada nachos same thing"}
{"text":"I usually get great service at Roberto's, however I stopped in at this location on Cactus because I was in the area. The people at this location is so rude. While I was ordering the rude lady turned her back to me and started bagging someone else's order. She came back to the register and asked me what I wanted so I had to repeat my entire order. I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"Why does everyone say Roberto's is only good when you're drunk? I heartily disagree!  I love the fact that their tacos are fresh corn tortillas wrapped around the meat of your choice, toothpicked shut and dropped into the deep fryer. Afterwards it's topped with lettuce, cotija and cheddar, and served with really, really good beans and rice.  The salsa roja packs a decent punch and a good flavor, I find the tomatillo salsa verde a little underwhelming, but a better match for the shredded chicken.  I also really like the carne asada tacos, with pico and guacamole, or the rolled tacos and guac. The tortas are friggin' huge. The carne asada fries are much-talked about but I think that might be one of those drunk foods.  The breakfast burritos are awesome, especially with bacon and roja.  I would advise staying away from the quesadillas, which are beyond greasy and rubbery. The chile relleno an enchiladas are a bit too cheesy and gooey for my taste, but it's certainly going to be to the liking of others.  I've been to a few Roberto's around the valley and this is the cleanest one I've ever seen. You could eat off the floor.  Of course, being all the way out in the soccer mom suburbs of Southern Highlands, there's nobody on the floor during the prime time drunken shenanigan hours."}
{"text":"I have to give a quick throw down update to Robertos... This place is walking distance from my house and the neighbors and I have been having late night beer pong tourneys and well nothing soakes up a stomach full of beer pong domination like a giant burrito, my new hangup is the breakfast burrito with bacon... This location is one of the cleaner and friendliest... I was shorted a side of Guacamole one time but other than that mishap the location has been spot on and helps to take care of any late night suffering!!"}
{"text":"I've become a regular here now so that every time I come in after work in the mornings, the staff knows my order! Haha. I've always wanted to achieve that familiarity with a restaurant and of course it would be Roberto's  Anyways, for the past few months, I have been getting the carne asada breakfast burrito with sausage meat added to it as well. You can't go wrong with this combo and it's so filling that I always only eat half and save the other half for later. The total comes out to be about $9, which is a pretty good price for a meal that can last me the whole day."}
{"text":"Best mexican around! Food always made fresh to order . I usually get the family favorite Chile colorado which is stewed/simmered to delicious perfection! Comes with 2 corn or flour tortillas which are huge. Next time I should just get the burrito since I can do without the beans and it'll be rolled for me. :)"}
{"text":"Roberto's is a pretty decent place for Mexican food in North Las Vegas. My friend lives just down the street from this place and I go here to feed the friends when I'm in town and everyone is craving something greasy.   I've tried the carne asada fries and they're pretty decent. There aren't too many options for Mexican around these parts so Roberto's is basically your only option."}
{"text":"The only thing Roberto's make GREAT is carne asada fries but the servers here are rude AF & slow AF. Don't ever get a quesadilla, it'll have more onions than meat."}
{"text":"I have some buddies that came up this weekend to celebrate ST. PATRICK'S DAY.  So where better to have a St. Paddy's day then Roberto's Taco Shop?  I told them that for Cinco de Mayo they will come back for a trip to a British Pub to have a pint of Guinness.  Anyhow, here is my review:  We checked out the menu that was here on Yelp!  and decided what we wanted before we came.  So, that's a bonus.  I ended up getting the 2 taco combo meal and a bean and cheese burrito.  I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the burrito was great.  A couple of my friends had the same thing and another had a torta.  She raved about it.  So, next time I go that will be the move I make.  We got our meals to go and they gave us all of the sides we needed.    So, it was a 4 star experience and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home."}
{"text":"Great food. Great place. Always made fresh to order and very quick. The employees are great and always make what I want and what I need without error."}
{"text":"Great authentic street Mexican food. Open 24 hrs I love tacos al pastor and adobado. The portions are generous !"}
{"text":"What's wrong with me? I used to go to Roberto's a lot when I lived in Vegas a few years ago. I've been back in Vegas since 2011 and tried Roberto's maybe twice. It's either gone downhill, or my tastes have changed. I had the enchilada plate- my go-to dish in the past.  The items seemed to kinda blend into one another. Nothing special about the flavors. A plate of pale and mushy food.    In the words of Hall & Oates, no can do."}
{"text":"We were starving on the way back to Las Vegas from the Hoover Dam.  I was on Yelp trying to find a place to stop and stumbled on this gem. My husband always says \"4 stars and 1 Dollar Sign? I'm in.\" Roberto's Taco Shop did not disappoint.   CARNE ASADA FRIES. Do it. You will have dreams about these fries. They are just that amazing. Honestly, the hubby and I ordered two combos and we both just ate on these fries.  I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo plate--I can't tell you anything about them (other than the rice and beans were tasty).    The carne asada fries on the other hand----The fries were crispy, fresh, hot, and amazing and topped with a heaping pile of juicy, hot carne asada meat, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and sour cream.  I took turns with the green and red salsas for dipping.  This are insanely delicious.   Tourists---DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP.  It's a must try on the drive between the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. Get the fries!"}
{"text":"Downhill this location has gone. Nothing like listening to the sounds of what could be a microwave. How could an enchilada be soft yet stale? We've come since the moment they've opened...they're pretty much the reason why I got on the Mexican fare bus. I know, right? I'm from an island where Taco Bell was as Mexican as it gets. Lol. I can say from experience if you go late at night as we would do...it's a hit or miss. Service is iffy too. But hey, if Robertos is your man...by all means. There is a reason I don't own a microwave in my home, and if I'm in a food establishment that uses it especially with me knowing so...eeeeek!  Needless to say, I know that Taco Bell isn't as Mexican as it gets and have frequented many Mexican restaurants to know. Hahahhaa. And what I also know is, I've got to be super drunk to want to come here because nothing would matter and the food would just be outright delicious. Microwaved and all.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When your transplanted Vegas (now in Austin) friend posts on Facebook that she is having serious (non-preg-related) cravings for carne asada fries, and the place she mentions is Roberto's, and you see there is a yelp listing for one just far enough that you can incorporate it into your daily workout as you jog there, and you're on vacation with no other lunch plans, and your wife is busy at a conference on The Strip, you just say \"Why not?\".  This location is a comfortable 1.75 mile walk/jog/run from our spot at the Venetian.  I wasn't sure it this location was even open yet (the website still said \"Coming Soon\"), but I decided to do a little recon anyway.  It's in a new shopping center on Paradise right across Harmon from The Hard Rock.  In Vegas fashion, it's open 24 hours a day, just like the Subway next door (who knew I could get Subway at 4 in the morning?).  When I got there, I thought it wasn't yet open.  But they had opened just a couple hours before (on May 2, 2016).    On to the food.  The Carne Asada Fries were as promised.  For $8, it is a Mount Charleston-sized pile of melted cheddar, beans, salsa, sour cream, onions, and guacamole-sauced goodness, piled onto just-fried potatoes.  I enjoyed it with my Dr. Pepper, but completely wish I had noticed the horchata to drink instead.  It really feeds two (or makes a decent second meal later), so a couple could devour an order, have a couple soft drinks (Pepsi line of products plus Dr. Pepper) for like 12 bucks.  The menu is a broad variety of tacos, burritos, torts, etc.  Just like you'd find near the southern border of California.  I saw other reviews for other locations that mention disinterested (or worse) staff.  But here (and to be fair, it was their first day) it was all smiles.  A little bit of San Diego's taco counter roots, planted BAM! in the middle of Las Vegas.  EDITOR'S NOTE:  Though it's perfectly acceptable to run here, you probably won't feel like running after you have more than, oh, a third of an order of those fries.  I had about half and walked back."}
{"text":"it's not real Mexican food. the only close to authentic was the condiments bar with the pickled carrot, jalapeño and the sauce. their taco was tasteless and boring, no flavor"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite Roberto's.  There's really nothing better than cheap, greasy, Mexican food after a long night of drinking, and I'm really grateful that Roberto's makes getting it so convenient for us.   We usually stop at the gas station its connected to on our way home from partying to pick up more drinks, and cigarettes, so the location couldn't be any more perfect. The people that work here actually understand my order, and get it done quickly, and correctly every time.   My favorites are the carne asada fries (a large to-go container filled with  fries, and smothered in meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream), and the California burrito (beef, potatoes, and some other stuff).  The taquitos are  really good too (and are also smothered in guacamole)."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go on your first date.  This is the place to go when you want to stuff your face, and take a nap. The food is great, but the place itself is really old, and ghetto looking, so I usually take my food to go. They are open 24 hours, which is a huge plus, but their menu is limited late at night."}
{"text":"If you don't like a business expressing their political views via campaign posters while your dining pick somewhere else.   Food is good and inexpensive.  Staff is polite."}
{"text":"It's a better option than Taco Bell, but what isn't?  I think this place is a little over-hyped.  It's not that expensive which is good, but the food is extremely greasy and sub-par.  If I am really hungry, it is tough to go the place because I'll usually end up with a stomach-ache - and I consider myself someone who has a pretty strong stomach.  Also they don't have a \"only chips\" option on their menu.  Not a huge deal, but the only option on the menu is \"chips and cheese.\"  The cheese isn't even melted, so it's like a lazy version of nachos.  I'd give this place a 3, but I feel I have to balance the force of the review system."}
{"text":"After SO many recommendations of this place from so many locals, we finally went for a late night dinner here.  For no one there at 11pm, I was astonished to see how much meat they were chopping up in the back of the kitchen.  There were 2 huge mountains of shredded chicken and 2 employees were cutting up what looked to be about 100 pounds of red meat.  No one else was in the restaurant!  Anyways..we went for the chicken burrito ($3), carne asada burrito ($4.50) and carne asada nachos ($6).  No rice, beans or cheese in the burritos, just a TON of meat and guac in the carne while the shredded chicken burrito had a couple of carrots.    Anyways, no point in going to Taco Bell for me!  My wife still prefers Taco Bell over this though."}
{"text":"Very affordable And I think this Robertos might even be cheaper than some of the others around town (obviously not by much, but still cheaper). The service is always decent but most importantly, the food is made really quickly compared to the other Robertos.  I always order ahead and it's usually waiting for me when I arrive.  The place is also way cleaner than most of the other Robertos which definitely makes a difference."}
{"text":"We came often to eat at midnight. Recently work people change that so bad attitude and service like they are sleeping at booth seat at front, they don't wash hands when you back to the kitchen, after cook go back to sleep again even customers are still eating and turn off table's light.  Please manage or checking how they work and customer service."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place gets good reviews, their food is mediocre at best. I have eaten here 5 times now (the people I live with keep ordering from there other wise I would have eaten there once only) and had a variety of things and the meats always taste reheated/microwaved the beans are dry and the rice is flavorless. Seeing how so many people like this place I never bothered to throw in my 2¢ about it but the last order I got was the beef tacos and one had half a splintered tooth pick in it that nearly went through the roof of my mouth! Now today with a sore mouth I'm writing this to warn others, the people who work there are nice but clearly do not care about the food they are serving."}
{"text":"We went here after a day of Christmas shopping.  The store was very dirty inside.  The worker taking our order was definitely stoned, friendly but in drugs.  Foods was pretty amazing. We didn't want to eat there since all the tables were dirty and trash was all over the floors."}
{"text":"Great place to go on Wednesday, it's half off on fresh tacos. I Love it, the employee are nice and friendly. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I like coming to Roberto's. They by far have the best carne asada nachos! Plus I like the fact that when I order it with no beans with the sour cream and guacamole on the side at the drive thru, they don't give me a hard time. I also like coming here on Wednesday's for their $0.99 chicken tacos!!! Can't go wrong with those especially if your on a budget! Lol... The green salsa is awesome!!! Really good place when your craving Mexican food late at night. Also a great location! 4 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Close to my brother place so tried it.  Prices are great because they give alot.  I ordered the carne asada fries came out fast and hot.  Brother ordered chicken enchiladas came with Spanish rice and refried beans he wolfed down that plate I guess his was good too."}
{"text":"I go all thr time and they are amazing!  Every time I call or come in they are always so polite and nice! Food is amazing! Even have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Good food but the last 3 times they have gotten my order wrong. I guess I should have checked it before I left."}
{"text":"They have good food but there sign that says \"All returns must be within 5 hours plus your receipt\" isn't valid. I returned mine within 20 min and the lady said it was my fault. Yeah I won't be going there again"}
{"text":"Have two stars instead of one because the food is usually up to Roberto's standards.   Didn't give 5 stars because they're very slow. Most Roberto's are MAYBE a 5 minute \"order to eat\" time frame. This location is usually 10+. Even the drive thru is crazy slow.   I only go here, cuz they're the closest to me and they usually get there food correct.. Although, they rarely get the sauce you want correct... Which is crazy to me, with all the allergies people have.  Once again, this neighborhood is slimy, covered with meth heads and out of work hookers.. I wouldn't come here at night unless I was strictly going through the drive thru. Ya heard?"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to try it. Don't go for atmosphere--go for good reasonably priced food. My cheese enchilada platter was delicious and my husband's chicken taco/enchilada combo was loaded with chicken. We were both very pleased with our lunch selections."}
{"text":"Asked for a California burrito with adobada instead of carne asada, they said okay. Check my food to see its not adobada, so I ask and then they tell me no it is. Literally unwrap the whole burrito and show it to them and then they tell me, \"oh sorry no adobada and no fries, tomorrow okay.\" What the fuck dude. Instead of getting what I asked for, they gave me a carne asada burrito and tried to lie to me about it."}
{"text":"I was staying in Vegas for a week, and I hit up this place 4 times! Seriously.  Before I dropped off my gf at the airport, she wanted this place to be her last meal before heading back to Fresno. Seriously. So good and as authentic as the taco shops in San Diego.  As a gift, I then took a best friend (who now lives in Vegas, and grew up in San Diego) to this taco shop. Sharing is caring."}
{"text":"How do you mess up a quesadilla.... Soaked and a complete mess... Second time here and the place is just not worth it last time was horrible this time as well soaked 2 plates freeze and fluid everywhere the tortilla was soaked and just gross I have never had worse Mexican food I will never return. I have ordered the simplest items on the menu and $10 for a quesadilla that has no flavor and is difficult to eat because it's sliding out of your hands. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I won't ever be back again.  Had a carne asada burrito.  Within 30 minutes I was sweating and violently sick. I was up all night with explosive diarrhea and 12 hours later I'm still sick. Won't ever be back again.  2 days and I'm still sick.  Filthy DUMP.  You have been warned"}
{"text":"Horrible food. No taste. Guac is so watered down.  The food basically went into the trash."}
{"text":"I asked for a bacon burrito and a regular breakfast burrito and then asked them to add chorizo. He took my money and then when the order was being made he asked me for 2.65 because he didn't charge me for bacon. I inquired why bacon was 2.65 if another burrito was 4.65? Is every other ingredient worth that little to equal 2.00. So long story short I paid the 2.65 so I could have the burritos. As I did this the wind blew the five dollar bill across the counter. He got pissed and said I threw it. So I took a one dollar bill and showed him by gently dropping the one dollar bill in the same spot. Yep...it blew on the floor. Then I got the burritos and they were terrible. They had no eggs in them. They were just bacon and chorizo. I will never eat at Roberto's again!"}
{"text":"Great service and clean! Love the taco Wednesday's!!! Fast and easy thing to pick up when you don't have time to cook... The workers are always so friendly"}
{"text":"Two words: Chile relleno.   Three more words: With the seeds?!   The order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly.   It has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.  However, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present.   Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.  History was already \"meh,\" and now #lunchfail. Potential just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Yeah somehow accidentally posted a review for Robertos. Great food!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I have really enjoyed the food. The first time, we were moving, tired as fuuuuuuck and this was the closest place to the house. My mom had been here before, but I hadn't. The restaurant is small, but has plenty of seating. The few times I've come, it's been consistently clean. It's a quiet ambiance with no music playing. They have a salsa bar with both red and green sauces, some carrots and onions mixed in a vinegar type of solution, green onions that should be cut up instead of whole stalks, and a few other things.   We usually order combination plates, so that we get the rice and beans. My mom ordered the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. You can choose between the steak or chicken and she had chose both, saying that the meat was well-seasoned and tender. They kind of remind me of taquitos, but they have more meat.   We have also had the tacos in the shredded beef, chicken, carne asada, and carnitas. All were good and you get a lot of meat, especially in the soft tacos. Each comes with guacamole and sauce. They put a lot of cheese on your tacos! No complaints from me...I am a certified cheese addict! Usually when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I have to ask for extra cheese. Not here, thank goodness!   Other family members have ordered burritos and they are really large and full of ingredients. One thing I didn't care for and that I think they need to change is the fact that they won't remove certain ingredients from the burritos. For example, my mom wanted a chicken burrito with no tomatoes and the lady said she couldn't because it's already mixed in there. That's news to me. I thought they put the fresh veggies in there when they are putting it together. My mom has an allergy to tomatoes, so I think that is something that should be changed for patrons with allergies. Basically, all burritos came this way, which meant that she couldn't enjoy any of them.  Otherwise, the food is really good and they have a pretty extensive menu, which made it easier for her to choose something else."}
{"text":"Ugh, I'm done coming to this place. They NEVER get my order right. I love the food here but what good is it if the order is wrong every single time. I'm done. Too many other options near by to choose from. You've lost good customers Roberto's."}
{"text":"The only reason there is two star is because they have okay food.  Other than that. Terrible service. He is getting mad for changing our order before he even put it in. No utensils. He tells us we need to hurry up because he doesn't like to go back and forth. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"It's Roberto' Tacos... It's fast taco shop kinda food, and I go here all the time.  On a revolving depending on what kinda of mood I am in... I get these things; Chili rellano burrito, chicken tacos, tacos de lingua, breakfast burrito and carne asada fries.  It is moderately priced half way decent Mexican food.  Actually, I would rather eat here than most Mexican restaurants in town.  The food is about the same, it's beans and rice with something wrapped in a tortilla.  But here it is cheap.  I am a little skeptical of the self serve salsa bar. I mean have you ever noticed people - of all walks of life - clumsily ladling salsa into tiny little plastic cups.  It drips off their fingers, the ladle handle slips into the sauce, their jacket sleeves hovering over the salsa. Basically, with out sounding like a winy snob, the salsa thing is kinda gross.  I always eat it though.  My own weird theory is the hot salsa will kill any germs.  In other words germs cannot live in hot sauce.  Which, I am pretty sure is not true, but it helps.  Also, this place displays political signs, which has no place in a restaurant.  They charge fifty cents to use a card."}
{"text":"If you want greasy Mexican food, you have come to the right place!  It's so evil in here, yet SO GOOD.  We made it part of our midweek lunch place - almost every week!  And what did we order every damn week!?!  SUPER CARNE ASADA NACHOS! (no beans)  They definitely do not hold back on the carne asada, which is always good!  The melted cheese (so greasy), sour cream, and pico de gallo create such a perfect harmony with the meat and the crunchy chips.  I just used \"perfect harmony\" while describing nachos.  I need help.  Just try to ignore the massive amounts of grease towards the bottom of the plate.  It'll make you feel really bad about what you just ate."}
{"text":"Food is made to order and delightful.  Gal at the counter seems miserable, with evil glares, and poor conversation skills.  If I didn't know any better I would think she was human trafficked and forced to serve my gringo self delicious rolled tacos three or four times a week.  Watch your back after dark and expect to be \"le me ax you sump tin man\"-ed by a chap holding a weed-waker.  Great food though, even if the neon green guacamole sets you off."}
{"text":"stopped in at like 4.30 am for a burrito before catching a flight.  it's right around the corner from the car rental return for the airport.  and the gas in the parking lot is much cheaper than the station 1/2 mile away at the car rental return.  so get a yummy burrito and fill your gas tank as well.   the burrito was delicous, btw...much better than i was expecting.  ususally things i eat at 4.30am seem amazing b/c i am drunk...that's why i'm eating...but this was delicious and i was 100% sober."}
{"text":"This Roberto's is located in super sketchy area inside a gas station, across from Texas Station casino.  It's the only drive through Roberto's I've ever seen, and I can see why it didn't take off. The amount of time it takes for you to get your food is the same as inside a regular Roberto's, so I imagine if there's ever more than one car in line, people get really antsy and annoyed, where really, it's just like ordering inside, same wait. Plus you can roll up in your pajamas.   Food taste and quality is consistent with other Roberto's, to me this had more entertainment value than anything- rolling up to a suspect speaker to order, waiting in car and watching people stumble across adjacent empty dirt lot into the night like walking dead, some shady dealing going on in poorly lit lot behind- just adds to atmosphere.   Probably will avoid though, sort of feel safer waiting inside regular Roberto's, lol."}
{"text":"Simply put, BEST HARD TACOS I've ever had. Mexican food is my favorite and nothing compares to what this place has to offer. Grew up in San Diego eating Mexican every day. Add sour cream or guacamole for the best taste."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of late night food for the drunks.  A bit worn out but not dirty.  Food has too much cheese but isn't that what you want to soak up the alcohol???  The food is plentiful and cheap. I have tried many of the dishes here and most are adequate or above.     The one serious standout is the chorizo breakfast burrito.   This is one serious oil tanker of a burrito.   It is easily two meals unless you have a serious hunger going on.   For 10 bucks you can get a pile of decent food in a divey Mexican restaurant with a counter to order at and some quiet booths tucked in dim corners.    As long as you know what this place is, it is brilliant."}
{"text":"Girl working the counter was NOT pleasant at all, down right rude.  We were trying to not let that ruin our Robertos fix, sadly the food was not up to normal standards.  Side bar with all the peppers, carrots etc was lacking normal ingredients, baggies and napkins were also out.   Carne Asada fries were good, bean burrito was ok, chicken tacos were horrible, meat dry and shells were so oddly chewie and hard at the same time.    Gonna have to rethink our Robertos meals hopefully this was just a one time bad day."}
{"text":"Love their food here especially their tamales, well now I'm hungry for some mexican food better go get me some tamales & churros"}
{"text":"I used to like Roberto's but it's gone downhill. I just tried one last time and I won't be back. This is the third time in a row my fish has been burnt black! (All 4 tacos.) The oil that the chicken tacos were fried in must have been old because they tasted rancid. Not happy."}
{"text":"The service is average but I love the food. The tacos and chips and guacamole are great dishes for me to eat."}
{"text":"Very slow with taking your order and then the wait for the food is even longer.    Only Robertos I have been too that is not clean."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Fries are amazing. You can't go there without trying them. The tacos are okay, beef chimichangas are pretty good also and so are the enchiladas.  My go-to place when I'm craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Eeeewwww!  Bad service.  Asked to have food to eat here and they packed it to  go.  Annoying!  They forgot about us and served others there order before us even though we were ahead.  I had to finally stand in front of them to get my order.  Now for the food.  Like I said, eeeewwww!  Shrimp was over cooked because they forgot it.  Chili rellano was horrible and the chili was so tough and stringy that is made it totaly enedible.   My dog liked the chicken out of the disgusting enchilada though."}
{"text":"So I drove here to do drive thru but when I got here I decided to eat in.  Friendly staff and food was fast and to top it off its next to dispensary 2 birds one stone"}
{"text":"Roberto's used to be really good food at a reasonable price but over the last year the quality of food has dropped and they've also added a 50 Cent charge for using a debit card and as of November 1st they raised all their prices by about a dollar to a dollar fifty per item making them by far more expensive than any other fast food place we lower quality food and another $0.50 making it even more costly if you don't pay in cash I'm really disappointed and sad to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yuck. Not good Mexican food, even for the price. Guacamole seemed to be made of mixing water with powdered avocado and they put it on the chips without telling you. Luckily my friend knew this ahead of time. The chips were also cooked with cheese more like crappy nachos. Weird. The chicken tacos I ordered tasted great but the shell was so over cooked it was like rock. The beans were equally watery and the rice was blah. The order said it came with tortillas but when I opened the wrapper I had someone else's taco. My friends order was equally screwed up and they gave her the wrong enchiladas."}
{"text":"Best Robertos in town! Big portions and reasonably priced. The food is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican style fast food. Coming from Southern California, this is the Vegas version of Alberto's. I enjoy the carne Assad's burrito with beans, cheese and guacamole."}
{"text":"My husband ordered nachos with beans when he brought them to the table in the park there was chips with cheese and sour cream  nothing else. He took them back and they gave him loaded nachos with very few chips. Part of the problem is  workers who do not speak english.  Maybe in the future hire Americans who speak the language.!"}
{"text":"I love Roberto's!! Grew up with it in college and now live in Los Angeles. Vegas is great since they have Roberto's. This location seemed great. Rolled tacos and guacamole and a carne asada taco. That's what I always get and this location is as good as any. It's definitely a dive but it's open 24 hours, good food and cheap. Especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic, real meat, real cheese, real home made tasting sauces, real fresh, Mexican food. You won't be walking out of this place wondering how many processed questionable food particles did I just ingest. This is the real deal folks. Unfortunately they have gotten a little too pricey and the help keeps getting worse which knocked the rating down a few stars."}
{"text":"We come here all the time, like once a week, maybe twice. We love that they're always open. And the food is good. :) win win."}
{"text":"Highly unsatisfied. I was in the area to go to the Goodwill outlet in the same shopping center and wanted to grab a bite to eat before hunting for deals. Checked Yelp and the locals seem to love the place so I gave it a try. Big mistake! Ordered 2 Carne asada tacos--nice size but zero flavor on the meat. Not even salt or pepper. The onion cilantro mix is ridiculous as the onions are chopped way too big and there there is barely any cilantro seen. The menu says it comes with guacamole but this is just a green liquid that resembles a green salsa without the jalapeño kick. The 2nd taco dripped about 1 teaspoon of grease onto my plate which caused my tortilla to break as well. Also ordered a Horchata and I don't taste any cinnamon!  Oh and what taqueria charges extra for chips?! Sorry locals, but this place is horrible!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little spot hidden in a gas station. I've once had their burrito here and it was average. What I did get when I was just here recently was the rolled tacos aka taquitos. Those weren't that great I think I should of stuck to the burritos or have gotta the street tacos. My meal came with beans and rice which again weren't that great. I'd rather of gotten beans and rice at another spot, but hey it did to the job of filling me up especially in the middle of the night. I'd still come back here for more rather than going to Taco Bell. Price here isn't as cheap as a normal fast food place like Taco Bell or Del Taco, that's because it's not really considered fast food. Open 24 hours with better burritos, would get me here rather than Taco Bell, unless I'm on a budget."}
{"text":"One of the best Robertos hands down! Will always come down the fries are on point the meat is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I called in an order for 2 fish burritos, upon arriving to pick them up I was told that I ordered beef burritos!  When I respectfully asked for fish instead the cashier rolled her eyes at me and started talking to another female employee in spanish!  That was enough for me to walk out, good luck in business with that attitude!"}
{"text":"Since my husband and I moved here to Vegas from NY, we were craving some fast Mexican food somewhere close to our home, so we stopped in here and I had the chorizo Burrito, and my husband got the enchilada plate!! Well now I have to have a chorizo Burrito at least once a week!! I absolutely love it!! I have never had anything bad from here! They always remember me when I call or come in!! Very friendly and fast service!! Great price for great food!! I have tried others but this one by far beats the rest with quality of food and cleanliness!! And of course again very friendly employees!! Thank you!! We will continue to visit you guys!!! :))))"}
{"text":"I go to Roberto's much too often, haha. I have only ever tried their carne asada fries, for obvious reasons. After recently introducing a friend to this magical concoction, we pick up an order together on a weekly basis. Carne asada fries are the perfect meal after a very long and busy day and they are great to share with a friend and chat over because each order is a very large portion. Like many Roberto's locations, this one is open 24 hours, a great plus in my book! This is Vegas, after all."}
{"text":"We ordered the #4 and #13 combo with side order of chips.#4 was two crispy tacos with rice and beans, for my tacos I ordered chicken and beef. Both meat had no flavor and the shell was not even crispy. My husband had the chimichanga which he had to cancel. We waited for our order for awhile, our # was called and we were informed that they are still making the chimichanga. We waited for another 10 min (every one was waiting for their food for awhile) when my husband just told them to cancel his order. I love Mexican food but this was the worst Mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Mexican food since moving to Nevada. So maybe tonight is a fluke, but I ordered rolled tacos aka taquitos and they were the worse I have ever tasted. The guacamole looks & tastes at least two days old and the tortilla is soft and soggy.  It will be awhile be I go back.   Today I called and he put me on hold for 4 minutes. I pulled into their parking lot and watched a guy walk in the door and get help at the counter, while I was still on Hold!  They need to learn customer service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since I moved to Vegas I've had  Shrimp cocktail,burritos and menudo and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Good food good service great prices."}
{"text":"If I could give this ZERO stars I would.  I lost my debit card and the last place I used it was at this location.  I called AND went to the store and the girl at the front counter REFUSED to go back to the office to look for the card or even ask if any cards had been turned in.  HORRIFIC SERVICE.  And, on a side note, my chicken tacos were excessively greasy."}
{"text":"Walked in, and the cashier was pretty friendly. I gave her the order, saw her input the special items correctly, paid and waited.  They were pretty quick at getting all of the food out, as my order was to go, and I was running late (Roberto's closest to work closed and we didn't know), I had to get back before I could open the container.  Now, the person who took my order, is also the person who packaged the food. She did not bother to remember or read the special instructions, thus getting my order wrong.  No big deal, I didn't want the other items anyway, apparently. The taste was almost absent on my enchilada. The chicken taco was good, the beef taco tasted a bit over-fried/crunchy.  The prices are a bit high for such mediocre/poor quality/taste. I think I will give other taco shops a try next time I am craving tacos."}
{"text":"If you want over-priced, absolutely flavorless tacos, Roberto's is the place for you! I was starving last night, craving some tacos. I haven't had Roberto's in ages, and was looking forward to some delicious tacos. I ordered a pile of crunchy tacos & a quesadilla, then went home to eat.  The chicken was an odd texture, with zero flavor. Seriously, why do I have to ask places for flavor in my food?  The quesadilla was just a foil wrapped puddle of grease that was leaking everywhere, and I couldn't get more than a few bites into it.  Seems my memory needed a reminder about why I didn't eat here anymore."}
{"text":"Any taco shop with a drive-thru automatically receives extra credit from me, and this Roberto's is no exception. Although there is another location that is a bit closer to our house, I would rather drive a bit further so I can order my food while wearing no pants. :)  The staff is as friendly as can be expected and I have never experienced any issues. The food is always delicious and made fresh and I really have no complaints. Plus, they are 24 hours - score!"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  I've never had a bad meal from Roberto's, although I am usually intoxicated while eating their food, so I wouldn't really know (or care) the difference!  There are much better places to get Mexican food....That being said, I love that they are 24 hours.  Sober or not, it is always nice to have an option other than Jack in the Box at 4am.  :)  Everything I've had has been fresh and freshly prepared.  There is just nothing overly spectacular about this place.  I would rather support a local, family owned mexican restaurant, rather than a large chain."}
{"text":"Not even worth one star! Wasted money last nite on special $1 tacos. My dog couldn't even eat them"}
{"text":"I've died and gone to HEAVEN!!  I actually squealed with delight when I saw that a Roberto's - with a 24 hour drive thru, no less - opened near the intersection of Lake Mead Pkwy and Boulder Hwy.  I love me some Mexican food, and I would much rather eat at a taco shop than at any sit down place.  I stopped at this new Roberto's around 6:30 in the morning yesterday on my way home from work.  This place will end up being the death of me!  It is what it is - cheap, fast Mexican cuisine.  I ordered a California burrito, and it was no different than any other I've tried.  I need to remember that I am not really a fan of those burritos unless I ask to add sour cream and guac, they usually tend to be too dry for me.  But the carne asada was delicious and the french frys were crispy.  Also, everything was cooked fresh and the tortila was really good.  Can't really complain for less than $5!  The restaurant is all shiny and new and everything is sparkling clean.  The cashier was friendly and it didn't take long for my food to be ready.  Their prices look decent, and must I remind you of the 24 HOUR DRIVE-THRU?!  That alone is worth a look, in my opinion!  I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"Sitting here now eating a late night chimi and holy flipping cow this thing is a monster! Worth the 10$ its just yummmy and yuuuuhggeee. There open 24hrs and i cant believe im saying this but i dont think i can finish it. Theyve got good costomer service and there clean. Im coming baaaaaccckkkk"}
{"text":"A little taste of San Diego, CA in the middle of Sin City.   When buffets and typical franchise fare ain't hittin' it, drive the rental car over to the far South end of this strip mall on Nellis Blvd and get your Carne Asada fix.   They got it all and a salsa bar included. Sorry, the hot sauce is self serve, no tiny pre-packaged plastic tubs thrown into your bag.   The folks working here could use a little more personality, in the kitchen there's a stack of tortillas 3 feet high, the burritos are smaller than what I see in SoCal, the prices are about the same and the joint is cleaner than most.   It helps they put up photos of the food on the overhead menu.   The ignorant Gringos who frequent Taco Bell have no idea what to order.  I was shocked, my relatives who live 3 miles from here for the past 15 years never tried this place before.   I was ready to throw a spicy carrot slice at them."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! The older lady at the cash register acts annoyed when she takes your order and doesn't seem to want to even take the order."}
{"text":"I'm very unsatisfied. There was a fly inside my drink. My food is never great and they don't ever give me the amount of salsas I ask for."}
{"text":"That was the most amazing chicken burrito ever.  The pork carnitas was delicious. Will definitely go there again before we leave.  Yummy yummy.  We found it on accident and said her let's try this place.  So glad we did.   Made the burrito fresh in front of me.  So good."}
{"text":"Hands-down some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life. I really don't understand what all the hype is? Aren't there enough Las Vegans who used to be Californians to know what good Mexican food is? No salt, no seasoning, no soul, no sabor! Someone gave me tacos from this place about four months ago and I thought they were horrible. But I wanted to give it another shot tonight so I ordered a torta tonight. Absolutely terrible. Even the raw green onions in the salsa bar had no flavor! How is that even possible? Even the menu looks gross...like a 6 year old colored it with one yellow crayon. Tacos EL Gordo continues to set the standard."}
{"text":"I came here after looking for some breakfast tacos for my coworkers. I'm not going to lie, this place is quite small and dirty. However, the people working there were very nice. Not a huge menu but decent selection"}
{"text":"This is one of the worse Roberto's I have been to. I dine at Roberts and Don Tortaco 1-2x a week. I went into this location and ordered CA burrito minus meat add guacamole. She told me there was a charge for guacamole. That does not make sense because I am not having meet in there. The other locations do it no problem. She wouldn't budge so my friend and I went to Heidi's Brooklyn Deli next Store and enjoyed our lunch"}
{"text":"Erika the cashier had no idea what she was doing when she helped me. I tried to be as polite and patient as possible, but she continued to not get my order correct. I ordered carne asada fries, a side of a rice, a side of sour cream, and a horchata. Simple order. Yet she didn't even ring me up for the sour cream or horchata. She ended up taking off the sour cream from my fries and put it on the side. Not what I ordered. Then when I confronted her about the missing items she gave me a lot of attitude because I \"didn't order it\". Even though I had told her three times I'd like a horchata and she never rung it up. I'm never coming back to this Roberto's. I was so frustrated I wanted to give everything back. I didn't even have an appetite to eat being so upset. The cook came to try to help with the problem but she only made it worse by not giving me the items I ordered. It is not difficult to give me a side or sour cream in the first place. Wish I could give this Roberto's less Han a one star rating."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since 2005 and have noticed its quality in product has dropped severely.  No more of their dried out carne today I get carne jerky ! Black as it gets too mmmm appealing. Then I call the manager to tell them and all I hear is this cannot be.  Please it's not the first time it's happened and it won't be the last its just the last time I'm dealing with paying money for crap praying it will be consistent.  Now I'm leaving my home office to go and return my food.  The manager gives and offers no customer service as I am here.  \"do you wanna you money back or what ?\" Ummmm  if any of my managers acted as such id be outraged. How about you as the manager make a decision to do what is right to make a customer.  I would have returned my money and made my food for free. This is ridiculous the lack of consideration knowing I had to take time out of my day to come back so they could fix their mistake.  I do business consulting and this restaurant needs major customer service manners.  I got my food remade because I will be writing reports for he next 7 hours and one taco and one quesadilla last for a long long time ! But to the white headed manager / owner learn how to treat your clients.  Do you offer to pay me my value for my personal time , my gas money ? No all very horrid service and I and all my friends as they read this on Yelp face book and Twitter @jennysook holler will know your customer service needs a major attitude adjustment !! Your hand delivered food to my table and a sorry was too little too late ! Have a better more apologetic attitude like that from the beginning not when I show up with my food showing you the travesty you served that you find edible giving me no excuse why it was served to be in the first place"}
{"text":"So late night is a problem here in drive thru ESPECIALLY! The guy rarely gets the orders right and at he window when you TRY and let him know what's wrong he tries to convince you not to get what you ordered because he doesn't want to ring up anything or FIX anything.   Then I get home and the me I ordered that's supposed to come with tortillas comes with none. Literally I'm over laying 30-50$$$ here for crap mediocre service when the one on Ft. Apache and Tropicana NEVER GIVES ME THESE ISSUES.   If your restaurant can't handle the drive thru without having EXCUSES for their errors.   When you call there they just blame each other , THEY NEVER APOLOGIZE OR try to fix what's just happened.   I'm never going back here"}
{"text":"I like the spaciousness and cleanliness of this location.  The marinated veggies at its salsa bar are always plentiful and fresh.  I prefer just a bean and cheese or machaca burrito, but their dinner plates are good as well as their rolled and regular tacos,  nachos and enchiladas.  Although its adjacent to a bar you don't even notice that."}
{"text":"I have been to Roberto's a few times over the years, but came to this location for the first time a few days ago. I haven't been in over 3 years so I will base it off this trip.   I had a bunch of family in town so we ordered a buttload of food. The total for 8 adult persons was about $70 (plus we tipped on top of that price). The food took about 10 minutes and not one thing was messed up. Bravo! While we waited we got green and red salsa, radishes, cucumbers, and the spicy carrot mix (all fresh and good, not scary germ cesspool-looking).  I personally got the carne asada fries (I requested no onions, but not sure if they come on it), a shredded beef taco, and ordered chips with guacamole and cheese for the table. The carne asada fries were more than I could eat! They were huge and could easily be shared as a full meal for 2. They had carne, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and beans on them. They were so delicious. I had them the next day and they weren't that bad. Reheated fries are never the same. I also had to eat the taco the next day (I made a good dent in the fries and was too full to eat it) and it was still pretty good. The chips were average. Nothing special honestly. I should have just ordered guacamole and put it on my On The Border chips with cheese I have at home.  They had an A grade showing, which if you watch \"dirty dining\" on the news you will know that Mexican and Chinese food restaurants tend to frequent the C, D, or F grade list. I love Mexican food and was happy to see a drive-thru AND that they are open 24 hrs a day. I do not like Taco Bell all that much, so I will drive an extra 1/4 of a mile around the corner to avoid their diarrhea burritos."}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars?   It's open 24/7, has a drive thru. There's like no one ever eating inside when I've been. Portions are big and prices are cheap. Always clean.   Snack on some carrots and cucumbers while you wait from the salsa bar. Heard a customer ask if they could fry the green onion from the salsa bar (which is free)- Robertos happily did.   Haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"It's clean it's a new Roberto's. Dollar Wednesday chicken tacos told me they charge full price for soft tacos?"}
{"text":"ROBERTO'S my ride or die!!! Still havent found carne asada fries that i like more. The meat and their skinny fries are perf. Ive tried A LOT of things on their menu. Their food is solid."}
{"text":"Roberto's Taco Shops are great.....this location....not so much. If you want to order your food, get home and find out it tastes weird or the meat inside is burnt to a char...by all means try this location. If not skip it!  This location sucks!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Robert's when you've had a few too many drinks. It's cheap and efficient. My top go to place!   This place did take longer than usual with making my food with only one order. I'm sure it's just because how busy they get at night."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Fries. By. The. Pound. I love this place. I will admit the place is small but the food isn't."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I'm trying to make this a tradition to stop here.  Food is so good!  It's like a southern Cali Alberto's but 1000 times better.  It's just the same idea minus Alberto's taste."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Roberto's for a while it's slowly going in the dumps! Ordered a Carne asada burrito it was full of unmelted cheese I asked them to remake it and they wouldn't rolled their eyes at me and said that's how they come along with \"what do you want me to do\" really your the restaurant worker you should take the time apologize and make it right along with the water downed green sauce I will NEVER go back so long to a 5 year customer!!!"}
{"text":"My place to go when im craving mexican food. They make my order quick when i make it To Go. When they make mistakes on my order ( 2 or 3 times) they would give me free food like a carne asada burrito. How nice of them.   I give it 4 instead of 5 because on this particular store, it gets pretty lonely when youre eating in and theres no music. They should add radio because it gets pretty weird when youre eating in silence. Hopefully they will add one sooner or later!"}
{"text":"This Roberto's is located on Rancho between Lake Mead and Owens, across from the Fiesta Rancho, inside the Sinclair gas station.    Went today 8-12-15 at 11:15 AM for some takeout.     I've eaten many different menu items at many different Roberto's and they have all been a let-down.  I hate the mexican food in Las Vegas for the most part.  Where I grew up it is just completely different and better, IMHO.     My co-workers drag me here every Wednesday because every Wednesday Roberto's has 99 cent chicken tacos.  They were pretty awful today.  All of them were greasy, bland, and the tortillas were like chewing on shoe leather.  Even dousing them in tomatillo salsa didn't help.  The lettuce was full of inedible stalk pieces.  Even the guy who cuts the lettuce there don't give a f**k.    My co-workers will continue to make me go here every Wednesday so I'll have to find something edible here soon.  Maybe they have french fries."}
{"text":"Don't trust the nightshift workers at this location they are very sketchy. Ordered chicken tacos and noticed the shrek looking woman at the window looking and laughing while inside and then I got my order and quickly realized why they were in the back laughing look at this taco it was burnt and the tortilla was broken"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE ROBERTOS!!! lol! I can eat mexican food all day, everyday and especially appreciate that they are open 24/7!!! Their food is authentic mexican food! So delicious and large portions! My eyes are always bigger than my belly and everything looks so good on their menu I often order more than I can handle and end up with leftovers, which is fine by me. They have always had great customer service with robertos and the food is always the best!"}
{"text":"Very good chicken tacos and chicken burritos. Rice and beans with combo. Tastes like authentic Mexican. Friendly staff too. I give it an A rating!"}
{"text":"So I am from Reno and we recently got a Roberto's there.  The hype is so great that you can't even get in the door at the Reno location so when I found it here in Vegas while traveling for work, I couldn't resist.  My coworkers and I ordered several tacos and a carnitas plate.  Everything was really good.  The tacos are HUGE and the portions plentiful.  Everything was very tasty, well seasoned and well prepared.  The meats were good quality - not too fatty or grissley.  A salsa bar is always a favorite of mine and this one was well stocked with carrots, jalepenos, cucumbers, lime and a variety of salsas.  The meals don't come with chips and there is no beer served here, so that was a bit of a bummer.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and quick service with large portions.  Would I wait 1.5 hours in Reno for it?  No.  Would I pop in for a quick meal if I was in the area?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"The best rebertos in town!!!! Always get three rolled tacos with sour cream and the carne asada fries are bomb! Also love the California burrito but the best thing ever is the chile relleno burrito!!!! Holy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever! They literally take about 10min to acknowledge you whether you're in the drive thru or inside. The cashiers talk to you like they don't want to be there but this Robertos needs new employees or needs to retrain the staff. Most of the time it's the lady that's in the drive thru during the night and I won't be eating from here anymore for that reason... TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I always go to the Roberto's on Montecito Pkwy and I've never had a problem there. I will continue to go to that location. At this location, she tried to upsell me for a drink by being vague about the price, they charged me $.50 for using a credit card, and the food made me sick. I've never had any of those problems at the other location."}
{"text":"Excellent, so many loocations to choose from in Cali and Las Vegas area. Order it to-go and you will get a larger serving."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this location. I come here a lot because it's right down the street from my house. Every single time I go here I know to check my food because there is always something wrong with my order. Whether it's forgetting something, getting the wrong order, or putting guacamole on my boyfriends food when he specifically asked for it without because he's allergic, I deal with it every time BUT I can live with that, I just make sure it's checked before I leave. HOWEVER, today was the last straw with them. Of course, once again, they got our order wrong and we forgot to check it when leaving because we were in a rush, my boyfriends rolled tacos with just cheese turned into rolled tacos with guacamole (which they charged me extra for when we specifically asked for the cheese ones) then there was pico hidden under my chimichanga, (when I also specially asked for no pico) guess that's our fault for not checking this time BUT then I went to cut into my chimichanga and to my surprise the meat was BRIGHT RED, not their usual \"a little pink\" but actually raw bright red meat... Are you kidding me? At that point we were done and went back to get our money back and honestly if they would have been cool about it it would have been fine but the lady was completely rude. First she tried telling me that's how their meat always looks, I get the same thing every time, I know their meat is usually a little pink, but this was not just a little pink, this was 100% raw. Then she asked for the receipt, no problem, gave her the receipt which was the only receipt she had given me when she gave me back my card, but she still tried asking for another receipt and of course tried making every excuse she could until finally just giving me cash for my purchase. Had she not been rude about it all I would still probably go back because we love robertos and this is the closest one to us but now I will be driving the extra couple miles to go to the one on Durango. I'm done with this location for good."}
{"text":"I was told that I have to try Roberto's when I moved to Vegas. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, so I wasn't really in a rush.   A friend told me he always gets the breakfast burrito at this specific location the morning after a night of heavy drinking. I decided to give it a shot one morning and I was hooked on Roberto's. I've tried a bunch of items on the menu, but always go back to the breakfast burrito. It cures everything.  The staff here are all very nice and service is quick so you're not standing around the gas station too long.  I visited another location (Buffalo/Charleston) and they prepared the breakfast burrito differently and the tortilla tasted old. I'll never stray from this property.  Additionally, I just noticed that they have daily sales. For example chicken tacos are $1 today. I found dinner!  There's also free wifi if you feel like sitting outside at a gas station eating a burrito and rocking your iPad."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland.  We ordered beef rolled tacos.  They barely had any meat.  My 6 year old said they were too plain.  We also had a cheese quesadilla which was dry.  The carnitas burrito had potential but it was soo bland.  The shredded beef chimichanga was good."}
{"text":"This specific Robertos location. It can get closed down for all I care and any other food joint that takes it place will instantly be better. I order some carne Asada fries. But I don't like pico de gallo. So I asked the lady \"no pico de gallo\" I'm standing there just  waiting.  and I hear the chef getting mad pointing at me screaming about pico. This dude is getting mad at me because I don't like something? Screw him. After him throwing a temper tantrum. Also a side note. This guy doesn't wear gloves. Pay attention to that stuff if you order from here. He then comes up to me and hands me it. Personally. Muttering under his breath about pico de gallo. I sit down and eat it. And it was terrible . Wayyyyy to much sour cream and the carne Asada was almost burnt. It was like chewing beef jerky. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"YOOOOOOO!!!!! This is the best place to get tacos PERIOD. Well actually I got the \"rolled tacos\" or taquitos. They are BOMB and the rice and beans were fresh and amazing and always are. Ive been here at 4pm/10pm/and 3am and no matter what time or how many people are there, the food is fresh, hot and amazing!!"}
{"text":"So-so Mexican food; I had a Cabeza taco and a burrito. Between the two of them something left me feeling a little queasy, my bet would be on the cabeza but not sure. The cabeza wasn't as good as I've had elsewhere. The burrito was a bit better. The food is cheap--you can find something that will fill you up for around $5 if you want to, but I am not sure if I'll be back.  EDIT: Food really didn't sit well with me. Knocking them down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Good  place  very clean employees are awesome . Place its big and look nice . I been there a many  times and never had any poblems with anything . Breakfast burito are the  best !"}
{"text":"Very small doesn't look to clean . And food doesn't taste the same as other ones . I was very happy at first to see that I have it next to my house . But I went there few times and I never go there anymore"}
{"text":"Nice place for the price clean , small but it's always parking outside and gas station right there so it's good if you need grab some food really quick"}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place being a pick-up window style Roberto's, but there wasn't much more I liked about it. The carne asada fries looked great but lacked any real taste beyond soggy fries and beans. The bacon breakfast burrito was ok, but again tasted more bland than anything. The only saving grace was the lengua (beef tongue) burrito. It was a decent price and the only thing with flavor of the night.  Flavor has never been a big problem with other locations, so I would skip this one and go to the next closest Roberto's in town"}
{"text":"If you want cold enchiladas where the cheese inside isn't melted and it's rock hard eat here."}
{"text":"This is the worst Roberto's I've been to. Terrible customer service!! They charge way to much to use my debit card!! C'mon 1.25 that's ridiculous I've heard of .50 then .95 cents extra for everything cheese,bacon on a breakfast burrito C'mon seriously that ridiculous!! Then forget asking questions,they couldn't answer it, looked at us like a deer in headlights and walked away to grab someone else that still couldn't understand and spoke good English just decided to ignore the question. The food portions are ridiculously small for what I paid. 4.00 for a breakfast burrito 3.90 for a carniasada burrito ended up totaled to 15. After all the dam fees!! Every other Roberto's I've been to I couldn't finish my meal it was so big these are like kids burritos! F this location"}
{"text":"Desagradable experiencia, compre un burrito de machaca y NO ERA MACHACA era carne hervida y desebrada sin sabor a nada, que lástima que no cocinen como antes y cambie el producto engañando a la gente muy mal"}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, we know good, authentic Mexican food. Got into town late on a Saturday night & spotted the bright neon red sign. So glad we stopped in. We had carne Asada tacos and they were amazing! Plenty of meat with yummy guacamole & we added cheese. Portions were generous & the food was excellent!. The staff was also very friendly! Will DEFINATELY visit again before we end our vacation & will come again next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's near our house, cheap, and they give a lot. May not be the best taco shop in town, but it'll do. My fave is the carne asada plate and/or the alpastor nachos! (Tho they charge you extra for the alpastor nachos. they have carne asada nachos in case you don't want the extra charge) My sister always gets their carne asada fries whenever she's in town (which is good). I've tried their chimichanga too, and I think it's also good. Their (chicken or beef) burritos could be better tho. Their tortilla is a bit hard for my liking.  I don't recommend their taco salad. I ordered one before (about 4 yrs ago), and the shell was burnt! I haven't ordered it again since then"}
{"text":"Tastes like home made! Better in some cases..  The tortillas tasted absolutely amazing, the carne asada was great. You gotta try the breakfast burritos. Customer service was great, our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"OMG, this taco salad is to die for. The ingredients are so fresh and the shell is crisp and flaky and one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was well seasoned and just the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"I visited the Robertos Tacos on 215 and Decatur,  It was Wednesday's dollar Taco. I ordered 2 tacos. The first taco was over cooked. I told the female worker. She looked at me like I was totally crazy.  She then proceeded to me imitate me, in spanish to the male worker who was cooking on the on the grill, when he asked her what did I need. I explain to her the taco was over cooked.  The chicken meat was dried out. The female worker refused to acknowledge and looked at the taco. Which in my opinion is rude. Her response was people always complain the tacos are grease. I told that is not the issue here. I then told her, to give me an order of rolled tacos. She then told me no, because they are the same. I am very disappointed in this Robertos taco shop. They are totally clueless when it comes to customer service. Thst is the reason they received a one star rating."}
{"text":"Roberto's is Decent and fast food with a drive thru and it's decently clean but nothing fancy. We could me to lots if the locations for quick Mexican food. The cashier seems nice and they have bathrooms that are decent."}
{"text":"It's not the best carne asada I've had, but it is heaped on generously to your fries.  You will also get an equally generous portion of guacamole, and all the ingredients that make up the carne asada fries.  Its prices are fair enough for how much food you get as well.  From what I understand, the other Roberto's locations do a better job, but this wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The place was quiet, very large clean when I got there they were cleaning. Its bright, cheerful and everyone was so helpful. Ordered chicken taquitos what I always get. They were fantastic, fresh cooked correctly. Lots of fresh salad and guacamole on top.The guacamole was almost flavorless but the salsa added with a little salt made it perfect and all was right in the world again. Anytime Im in the area and craving a taquito fix I will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Got Carne asada fries and the portion was giant!! Definitely sharing size! Only complaint is the sauce cups were prefilled and they were all less than half filled so you needed several."}
{"text":"The location is the best I've tried. Always get the order right & the mexican rice is great!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is bad. The staff is rude on top of it. Just don't... your better off going a couple of extra miles to the next Roberto's. After coming to this location multiple times and being cool with placing an order and showing up but I still have to wait cause they hadn't even started my order. I don't really make reviews although I plan to more often. I just felt compelled to express my opinion on this place cause it's that bad. Please don't waste your time, especially if you read this."}
{"text":"I had the worst nachos ever!! I didn't ask for a blob of mean and a few soggy chips under the blob!! I got beef and some pieces looked raw... That was a waste of $8 !"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Roberto's, but over the years, this location has consistently been the worst one in the area. In 9 years of Roberto's, this is the only one that's given me food poisoning (chicken chimichanga). The quality is also generally lousy which is weird since every other one pretty much tastes exactly the same - kind of the point of a chain.   You may wonder why I'd go back to a place that I know sucks. What can I say, I'm a typical lazy American and a 24hr drive thru is a powerful draw.   Got beef nachos and the shredded beef had a dog food like consistency. So yes it's convenient, but you've been warned. There's a billion other Roberto's so I'd suggest avoiding this one unless you're feeling super lazy."}
{"text":"I like this place but they can't get an order right for nothing ! I would have died already if I was actually allergic to beans. I said no beans about 3 times, took a bite and got a mouth full of beans  this has happened twice already and I had to drive all the way back to get a new one..  Service is everything too me so 2 stars"}
{"text":"You can't beat a 24hrs spot that had carne asada fries! I prefer this location to several other Roberto's (Losee & Craig) because they are very consistent"}
{"text":"Super slow drive thru! The cashiers are always so slow and they even forget you are waiting for them to take your order.... be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for them to take your order,  5 minutes to collect your money and 15 minutes to get your food. Just horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food (MTO) made to order! Great prices, and you get your $ worth! They are open 24 hrs. An they have daily specials! They have a taco day.. 0.99 tacos. The Carne asada burrito is super yummy and huge!  Shredded beef taco is my favorite! Way better than chipotle,& you get more bang for your buck! An it's not meat/ food sitting around to be scooped out of a pan while people point at it! The staff here is really nice and helpful! An if you need something sweet try the Rice milk.. It taste like a churro!"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries are awesome! A must try :)  I've also had the rolled tacos and regular soft tacos, they were mediocre.  Overall Roberto's is a great place to go when you're looking for a quick meal. It's never crowded and they're consistent with their service and products."}
{"text":"I am not exaggerating when I say this is THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! I'm visiting from Ohio and want to move here just for Roberto's! Everything I have tried is beyond delicious! You'll never want to go to another Mexican joint ever again! Everything is made in house and authentic! You'll fall in love!"}
{"text":"Tacos are good, but there's no way to wash your hands only sanitizer, friendly employees"}
{"text":"Odele muthafuckas...this is hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants I know of. Gives me one more reason to thank the Mexican culture. I generally order the carne asada burrito,beans,guacamole,sour cream,pico de gallo and a lil Mexicana love. And you know what I love about a lot of Mecican restaurants...they post pictures of the actual food. Compadres, this is muy bueno."}
{"text":"Good service, delicious homemade taco shells with steak meat, good beans, fluffy rice.  The Carne asada fries were good too.  I like to go here on Saturday morning to grab freshly made breakfast burritos too.  They're so huge I can only eat half So I share the other half."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about food & have never had a problem with this location till recently. Not only did they skimp out on the quantity of the food but, the quality as well. I don't think I will be returning to this location no matter how convenient it is.  Not to mention their burritos at this location is like 1/2 or 1/3 the size of all the other locations that I've visited.   I don't think I've ever been this dissatisfied with any Roberto's Taco Shop location!"}
{"text":"I got a big ole buddy that loves to eat that recommended this spot... And I usually take his word as bond cause like I said, this brotha can put down some food, and some good food at that.   The place didn't really stand out as I tried to locate it but once I found it I ordered the carne asada tacos to see what they we working with here. I wouldn't say I was blown away but I was satisfied. Decided to give it another shot and order the carne asada fries. Now that was what I looking for! I never imagined fries tasting so good.  Needless to say, after going to Roberto's two days in a row, I'm currently on the John. But it was worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. My daughters cup had a hole in the side of it. Not only did I clean up the mess but was charged for a new cup. Always had great service until now. Last time we'll be coming to this location."}
{"text":"Love Roberto's entire menu!! Staff here is always very pleasant and very cheerful!! Marylin is top always cheerful and hard worker!"}
{"text":"It's your common tequileria.  Don't expect anything here to change your life and bring you back. It's the usual food pictures on the wall, fast Mexican food. The place is dingy for that area.  If you're hungry and want some sloppy Mexican food, this place will suit you. I had their chicken burrito to be safe and it was big and just fine."}
{"text":"I love this place. They're good, not expensive, and open 24/7. Roberto's all over Vegas is awesome :) been a fan since 2005 lol"}
{"text":"This place is a must stop at on every Vegas trip of ours. Their carne asada breakfast burrito is to die for and they serve it 24 hours a day. Their pickled onions and carrots at the condiment bar goes well with anything they serve. Yeah there's nothing glamorous about this place but after a night of partying and drinking this place always hits the spot as a hangover cure. Considering it's in this small sketchy strip mall behind a 7-11 inside Roberto's is actually very clean for what it is. The guys working there are nice enough and the food is always consistent and a great value overall. I'd rather eat here than a majority of those fancy expensive foofy places on the Strip."}
{"text":"We come here on every Vegas trip we take. Time and time again it turns out to be one of the better meals we have in Vegas. We always get the same thing, the carne asada breakfast burrito. It's mad cheap and very satisfying. I've been to all the foofy places on the strip too like Robuchon, Savoy, Gordon Ramsay's and Bobby Flay's places, STK....yeah no thanks. I don't see the point in dropping a mortgage payment on one meal. If you're on a date or trying to impress a lady don't take her here. If you're hung over to the wall and need some sustenance to detox this place is it. It'll leave you plenty of money to retox that night."}
{"text":"Food is lacking, soggy...We have been to this location before but it seems to be going downhill., this review reflects the recent price change as well. $18.08 for 3 chicken tacos and 1 chicken quesadilla.....no sides, no drinks. The quality AND quantity of the food is not worth this price. We won't be back. Pictures speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Roberto's, how can I describe you best? Oh I know...CRAZY GOOD DRUNK FOOD!   After a long night out on the town, partying and drinking it up, head to Roberto's to fulfill your late night munchies. Can I recommend the carne asada nachos? Warm tortilla chips piled high with fresh carne asada meat, guacamole, sour cream and TONS of cheese. Aye papi!   All-in-all: Good mexican food, fair prices, lots of bang for your buck, made to order, always fresh. Muy bueno ;)"}
{"text":"Roberto's is far from my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it does the job. Their rolled tacos are not bad, and their carne asada burrito is okay.   I'm not too fond of the quality of the carne nor the seasoning. However, I realized they have decent lunch special combos. I got the carne asada taco plate for lunch, which came with a drink, and was sufficiently stuffed for $5. I call that a decent fast food deal."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place many times, and finally decided I wanted to eat a carne asada burrito. I'm used to eating burritos in California, where the standard carne asada comes with mexican rice inside. Yeah...I'm not a traditionalist.   I found out here as well (for the second time) that you need to ask for rice and pay extra for it. That's fine and dandy, I can live with it. But, the carne asada meat itself was meh, and the burrito in general was an OK for me. I wasn't too impressed. I also thought it'd be a hole-in-the-wall, which is what I was hoping for, but it's actually set-up like a fast food chain store! That was unexpected.   Prices are way too high for what they serve. The salsa bar was okay as well."}
{"text":"I am extremely happy they have a place like this in Las Vegas. I was scared when I moved here I wasn't going to be able to satisfy my super nacho fix. Roberto's is the place to go for late night Mexican food. Plus, everything is decently priced. I will definitely be back.  I recommend anyone to give this taco shop a try. If you don't know what to order, try any of the following:  -Three Rolled Tacos -Carne Asada Burrito -Anything with Carnitas  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Taco Wednesday rocks. Came here around 7:30 PM to pick up quick dinner. Long wait time in the drive thru kept us until 8:20. It also seemed like the chicken tacos were dumped and kept in oil for too long. Aside from the 40 min wait time as well as the overly greasy food, the woman at the drive thru window was nice and also patient when I requested something be changed to my order. Will choose better time to go to this location from now on though!"}
{"text":"The food always taste amazing.   However,  They cannot/will not customize your order correctly.   I have ordered on multiple occasions and every single time the order is incorrect.  If you are very picky or have eating restrictions, this place is not for you!"}
{"text":"So-so americanized Mexican food... In other words it's bland... The service is horrible.. Rude and not helpful staff.. Avoid at all costs.. Stick to taco bell or del taco......."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional, rude, barely speak & understand English. Much better food at Frijoles and Frescas."}
{"text":"My favorite Roberto's in town great service and the food was hot and fresh very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Back I went to Roberto's for lunch, where I indulged in a large Wet Bean & Cheese Burrito and a crunchy Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito was almost swimming in Enchilada Sauce, and the burrito's interior was chockfull of refritos and cheese with some strands of cheese on top as well--although I would have preferred some melted cheese.    With creamy guacamole and pieces of fresh tomato added to shreds of beef inside a crisp but malleable taco shell, the taco was excellent, except not much guac was included for $1.10 extra.  Service was friendly, and a somewhat complicated order came out exactly right.  It was another satisfying lunch at this Roberto's."}
{"text":"On this latest occasion I had a massive Wet Bean & Cheese Burrito smothered with Cheddar Cheese and overpowering Enchilada Sauce, along with a Shredded Beef Taco with tomatoes and guacamole.  Unfortunately, little guacamole was added to the taco, and it was of the creamy sour cream variety.  An excellent pliable fried corn tortilla was utilized in the preparation of the taco.  And, the Refritos were hot and smooth inside the nice flour tortilla casing of the burrito.  As always at a Roberto's Taco Shop, hot carrots and peppers and two types of hot sauce were on hand.  Paper napkins are tightly controlled here, even though a need often exists for multiple numbers of them.    Overall, a solid taco shop, with 3-1/2 stars earned on this particular visit."}
{"text":"Update.. they have dramatically increased the prices it seems. In some instances 50-75%. It was good for what it was before but for the prices now I'd rather just go to a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of Roberto's. Recently started trying them again at this location. Found I enjoy the beef tacos and the adoboda burrito very tasty. Close convenient location to my house always very clean with quick friendly service. Price is very fair for what you get."}
{"text":"Not one of the better Roberto's in town. Salsa is so so and they charge $2.89 for plain chips! Everyone else charges a buck. Food is decent."}
{"text":"Poor customer service... salsa bar but chips are $2.00, $2.50 if you want cheese. Burritos are really good and carne Asada fries have a huge potion and are pretty good."}
{"text":"Can someone tell me I should pay 10 bucks for something like this ...this Roberto's is the worst I've been to and it's every visit the food taste bad they skim u wit the food these Carne asada fries the worst meat burn old and hard I'll just let the picture do the talkin I will not return to this location as another review said there's a problem wit this location and they should fix it and quick"}
{"text":"I stopped at this taqueria on the way home from Las Vegas superbowl wknd. It was breakfast to begin my drive back to LA. I had thought of this place since I got into town and if you like a breakfast burrito as I do this place won't do u wrong. Reminiscent of East LA taco joints this was all of that. Fresh made salsa, both green and red, spicy pickled carrots and radish, limes just like at home. IMO it could have been a little bigger but for the price it was fair $6. Made right there as you order, served hot and tasty and filling. Skip the overpriced buffet breakfast at the casinos and take a 5 minute drive from the strip that will reward you with yummy for your tummy. 3.5 star food 4 star price, speed and service. 4 star overall. Many locations in Vegas probably all very similar. Enjoy."}
{"text":"First time in this location. I've ordered crispy tacos take away. When I got home and open the bag it dripped unbelievable amount of oil. On the sofa and on my clothes. The tacos was soaking wet with oil. But the pickled carrots are good. Don't order crispy tacos!  I love Robertos tacos but not this location."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by here while meeting a client for work. This has to be the cleanest and friendliest Roberto's I've ever been to. The workers were friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. I had the breakfast burrito with scrambled eggs, chorizo, and bacon. The next time I'm in the area, I'll stop by. Next time I will try the carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"horrible. inedible. they smothered the rolled tacos in cheese, which didnt help the lack of taste, not to mention that it was just a greasy mess.  i gave it all to my dog... atleast someone was happy that night."}
{"text":"the worst location in las vegas- avoid at all costs. this place is always filthy and equipped  with incompetent, rude staff. ordered a wet burrito, was given a box of fries. are you serious? can't even trust these people with a very simple order which took over 20 minutes. do not waste your time and money on this b/s establishment."}
{"text":"The employees were very pleasant & service was prompt. The carne asada burrito was pretty good. I little too salty but overall pretty tasty. However the rolled tacos had no flavor at all. The meat & guacamole had no taste, the beans it came with didn't have any flavor either. The only thing that tasted decent was the rice. Even the hot sauce was tasteless. I really wanted to like this place but my food was too disappointing. Unfortunately, next time I'll have to stick with my original plan of going to Del Taco, haha."}
{"text":"You can take the girl out of California, but you can't take the California Burrito love out of the girl.   There are Roberto's all over, but this spot is right near my house. I'm on the way fence whether this is a good thing. The location is across from UNLV so it gets busy quickly. There is a parking lot, which is nice, and cars are constantly coming and going.   The woman behind the counter is a beast. She moves quickly and gets your order in fast. The foods takes a bit, seemed like there may have only been on person on the line, but it's decent. The tortillas are full of all the lard, so obviously they are delicious. The burrito itself was a bit dry, but it curved my craving for a bit.   Wednesday's they do chicken tacos for $1.40 something. Not a bad deal. Whether you're in college, or just need a deal, you will find yourself satisfied."}
{"text":"You know, it's easy to trash on Roberto's.  The food isn't particularly good, it's pretty bland actually, the quality of the product isn't exactly up there and the service is whatever.  This place is perfectly average across the board.    But it's one of the first meals I had in Vegas and it's open 24/7.  Much like Pho Kim Long, there's something reassuring about these 24/7 spots that you can rely on for a halfway decent meal that will fill you up for cheap."}
{"text":"This is the worst Roberto's ever! I'd rather drive an extra mile or two out of my way than come back here. The staff is rude, they don't use common sense & they completely ignore you if you ask for clarification. Not to mention, they can't get an order right if you modify in any way. How hard is it to not add egg to a burrito?! They are ridiculous! The women that work here are angry, miserable, rude people! So disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"worst service ever It was ridiculous how they put together my carnitas fries and carne asada nachos hardly no fries or chips with a little meat never again!x"}
{"text":"The In-N-Out of mexican food..  They wear gloves when handling your food you paid for, that is stellar service. The Robertos i went to on South Eastern is awesome as well, I think better but I live on the west side of Vegas so this gets my review. The Robertos on Owens is terrible and ghetto.  Great place, freshness everywhere! Fresh Pepsi products! From the jalapenos/carrots/onions bathing in the vinegar spiced juices to the tortilla and the innards of any burrito you want, everything is immaculate, polite staff, everything is clean minus the graffiti. I've had all burritos from Bean and Cheese to Carne Asada(I'll go further down the menu later down the road), AWESOME. They're the most expensive I have ever paid for a great place (big tacos $2.75 with meat, pico, guac) but \"F\" it, it's quality. Pure quality, love it. I dig this place over Del taco and Taco Bell for mexican food. I've been to a few other places but Robertos always hits the spot. Quality. That is what spells Robertos.  P.S. They have$1 chicken tacos every wednesday which are awesome as hell. Add sour cream, cold pepsi, jalapenos and carrot slices in the vinegar juices and OMFG...  I always come here, the only time I don't is when they don't wear gloves. If anybody doesn't wear gloves touching my food or I can't see the cooks wearing gloves handling my money in the kitchen, that restuarant doesn't get my business, i shouldn't have to lick cooks hands. So what if people don't like rules, don't make a career out of a fast food job you don't like. You don't like working there, piss off!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Roberto's to where I live, and it's a good place to go for some quick Mexican food.   The place is clean, staff is friendly and service is fast. They also have a salsa bar, and the spicy carrots are highly addictive.   The Adobada burrito is my favorite of the ones that I've tried. The Machaca burrito is a winner if you're feeling slightly hungover after a night out."}
{"text":"Low grade dog food served up by unfriendly people. Add ons were $3.70 more and were barely visible.  It was across from my hotel - otherwise I never would've even tried it. Should've gone to the Subway next door."}
{"text":"Tasty and very reasonably priced Mexican food. Just got back from a 3yr tour in the UK, and I'm sure this goes without saying...you can't find any decent Mexican food there! So finding Roberto's was great! We've only done takeout, and they are always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"My friend and I got sick last time we ate here. I got food poisoning so badly I ended up in the hospital. Their food is good until you're a few bites in and realize they don't use seasoning on anything. Very plain and average \"authentic\" Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ordered a taco salad and asada taco. Theyre fine. They tasted like home-made tacos in Mexico with a little bit of tex-mex. Good for the money."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my food and experience. I am on a budget ATM and I find out after my card was ran and I was signing that there is a .50 charge. Irritating but not the reason I am writing this. The burrito I ordered to go was still raw. Super hot egg and cheese but the potatoes were cold and still raw. Not happy with this franchise I will not go to this one anymore."}
{"text":"I like Roberto's. This one (the closest one to my house) is one of the nicer ones in town. I tend to try different stuff when I visit. Tonight I was in a carne asada burrito mood. Got the special which came with rice, beans and a drink for $6.75. I always take advantage of their salsa and veggie bar as well. Great, quick service too. Always a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this Robertos 4 stars because I've been to a lot of Robertos around Las Vegas and I really like this one and drive a little further than another location to go. I've also been to this location about a dozen times and my experience has been consistent.   This location is attached to the AM/PM gas station, it's clean when I go, the condiment bar is stocked and the people working are nice. I've only had an issue of a mistake on an order once and it was fixed without a problem.  So my food recommendations.. Get a breakfast burrito anytime of day, they are huge, made fresh and ask if you want extra cheese or anything you prefer. Carne asada or adobada is really good from Robertos especially on chips or fries and I always ask for my fries extra crispy. I also recommend to skip the Wednesday chicken taco deal, they are fried and usually dripping in grease and just not worth it.  I will definitely be back to this Robertos for a carne asada breakfast burrito with extra cheese!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the attitude of the staff is something to be desired. The girl at the front counter does not greet you and she looks and acts like your bothering her. I ordered $100 worth of breakfast burritos for my staff, but next time it won't be here. Many of other options with a much friendlier staff. No one here says hello or thank you.   I see all the same reviews, but I guess it falls on deaf ears. What a shame."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas about a year and a half ago and I have always heard soooooo much about Robertos!  So I finally had to try it and see what all the hype was about... I started with something super simple, I had crispy chicken tacos, and I must admit they were quite yummy! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Roberto's. They are consistant across the board. This one is located next to a bar so once in a while I will see the bouncers for the bar inside, eating. The staff are friendly and always make large portions."}
{"text":"Roberto's is awesome.  I go here every week. They make my food hot and to order. They greet me with a smile and always thank me. Their prices are awesome and portions are large. They add value to my dollar and even if I am strapped for cash I can always find enough to get a bean and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Lets start with the friendly staff. The woman who took my order was running the drive through along with the main register. She did quite well and was very friendly even when some drunks spilled their soda on the condiment bar.   With exception of the customer created mess the restaurant was clean. The food was mad quick and was ok. Some of the Steak in my Steak Fries was cold and their steak is pre-cooked. The Bean an Cheese Burrito was ok. I was satisfied with the meal for the price.   I gave it 3 stars, because the Fort Apache and Tropicana Roberto's makes is a a lot better with the quality of food."}
{"text":"I go here two to three times a month. Always friendly and always good fresh food."}
{"text":"Adobada fries. Delicious. Customer service was friendly. Environment on the inside was pretty clean. It's Roberto's, so come on!"}
{"text":"This Roberto's location never disappoints. They're open 24/7 and always get my orders correct. It's very clean and the employees are very nice. They have the open bar full of limes, vegetables, and sauces. The portions are huge for a great price. Sometimes I even call ahead of time to pick up my order right away.  Adobada Fries $8.10- adobada meat, french fries, cheese, sour cream, salsa, guacamole (however I don't like avocado so I don't get it)  Breakfast burrito $4.35- eggs, potato, cheese  Carne asada burrito $5.65- carne asada meat, guacamole, salsa  Chorizo burrito $4.00- pork sausage, eggs"}
{"text":"Our worst Roberto's experience ever! Roberto's is usually out go to late night dining experience and have had good experiences at many of the other locations so we have come to trust the quality of the chains food; that is except for this location.  First off coming here late a night is a bad idea. The salsa bar was a buffet for local bums. While we were waiting for our food, we saw 2 different bums walk in and grab carrots and ice and then walk out .  When we ordered there was no one else waiting for food so we thought naturally that we would get our food rather quickly. Not the case, 2 orders went out before we got our food an when we did it was sitting on the queuing rack. I must've been there for at least 10 minutes.   When we finally got back to the room eat our food we were disappointed with what we got.  First the carne asada fries were a disaster. The fries were undercooked and raw and the carne asada was nearly burnt to a crisp. There were tons of black burnt bits mixed into the fires as well. We had to fish though the entire box and pick out the burnt chunks. Every other piece of meat was burnt on one end so even the \"safe pieces\" weren't edible. See my pics of the  dish if you don't believe me.  The cantinas tacos had the same problem. The carnitas was old and hard like jerky an could not be eaten w/o breaking a tooth.   The only thing that was \"normal\" was the rolled tacos.   Another major mess up was there was guacamole on everything when I specifically asked for no guacamole since the GF is allergic.  We hate to waste food but none of this was edible. If you dont believe me look at the pictures I uploaded...   The place is not on par with the other Roberto's that we have eaten at. I don't want to thrash a business but there are many things that need to be taken care of at this location. I'm sure that this place would be a health inspectors dream...   Shame on you Mr. Roberto for this place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Lolita I will never stray from you and your wonderful Carne Asada fries...   Roberto, I wish your fries were as good as your rolled tacos. It was way too goopy and heavy with guac and beans and a little layer of fries.  But on the flip side I'm not complaining about the loads of carne asada that was piled up on the top..   It was close but nothing beats the real thing..."}
{"text":"It's now Laurita's Taco Shop. Roberto's are a well know sight in Las Vegas. This location is fairly new and is usually clean. The staff are friendly, the food is good, and the prices are affordable.  I'm not sure what happened, but the name at this location is now Laurita's Taco Shop, but everything else is still the same."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped to get some chicken tacos. They weren't authentically Mexican at all, but we're ok and filling. Staff were positive."}
{"text":"This Roberto's location is great!  The food is always fresh and the place is clean.  The staff is friendly.  The enchiladas are a great deal, 2 for $4.50.  Everything I have tried has been great!  Fish tacos, Carnitas plate, bean & cheese burrito!  All delicious!"}
{"text":"Same Roberto's menu, but at a convenient location at the corner of Fort Apache and Charleston (across the street from Claim Jumper and P.F.Chang's). Perfect for grabbing some filling Mexican food while you get gas or waiting for your car's tune-up.  There are some tables and chairs out front, but if you intend to get your grub on right there, be sure to tell them that it is not a to-go order. The food is prepared very quickly, and there is hardly any wait time after your order has been placed.   This is the perfect place to go if you are hungry and in a rush,regardless of the time of day or night"}
{"text":"As far as an inexpensive but still really excellent burritos is concern, this Roberto's is the best out of the ones (the others are located in the SW) I have actually tried.  Unlike the other locations, the burritos served here comes to you nice and hot. The burritos is packed with the filling you ordered, and not with rice and beans.  The burrito I love ordering here the most is Lengua (tongue), it is simply the best.  I actually went here for lunch and again for dinner after my class in the same day.  And they do serve Shrimp Burrito at this location.  They also have a simple fresh juice bar, where they will squeeze fresh oranges or carrots for your real fruits and vegetable juice.  The decore is not impressive, although a crew was in there tonight to do some remodeling. So next week, when I go back, the interior may look a lot more presentable.  They still have a few arcade games in there, and the jukebox too.  The salsa, cucumber and other garnishes are still available in the self served bar.  The staff here have no problem taking my order in English. The drive through is pretty active, but I didn't see a huge crowd in the store or in line for the drive-thru (could be the late lunch and late dinner times I was there).  Parking is not a hassel here. Location-wise, I would recommend it to any CSN student attending classes or works at the Cheyanne campus and others in the area.  I would not recommend driving to North Las Vegas if you live or work too far away just to eat here.  5 Stars for delicious burritos, good value for the money, and nice hard working staff in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This location is one of many Roberto's in the area, but is the one I visit the most -the food is good, not great - the staff is nice and service is prompt - location is clean, never disgusting like some other Roberto's - they take care to always handle special orders well  -their drinks are actually really good. I love the Jamaica and the piña here more than some other places - they take phone orders, which amazingly, some Roberto's do not - their shrimp burritos are spicier than most other Roberto's in town  Not the best Mexican food you'll have, but you won't be disappointed if you're eating here."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again.  They will ask you if you want something on your taco.  Normal things that come with the price of a taco, and then charge you for it.  My grandson only wanted cheese and meat on his taco and then smothered it in sour cream, too, and charged $1.10 for it, and also $1.10 for the cheese.  Taco shells were overlooked and hard to eat.  Too many other good places to eat.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"Stupidly overpriced nachos for fast food, and when I asked if they came with lettuce, the answer was \"No, but it can be added for $1 extra\". LETTUCE!   I already did not like Roberto's solely because their food is incredibly weak, but this pushed it over the top."}
{"text":"I would give this place four stars, as I love everything about it, except the lady behind the counter. She has zero personality and can even be rude at times. We just went for for Taco Tuesday, and after ordering our tacos, we find out it's Taco Wednesday.  My wife ordered 3 tacos and we get a \"combo #3\" which I explained to her was wrong and she got loud and rude arguing with me.  She's in there every time we go, so maybe she needs a day off or six."}
{"text":"I really liked Roberto's but this is the end. We would go to the one on Sunset in Henderson every week. About 2 months ago they changed the staff. The guy that appeared to be in charge was a jerk yelling at the other staff. I ordered Chili Colorado special when I got home I found it was a box of boiled meat. They forgot the Colorado sauce. Last strike so we switched to the one on S Las Vegas Blvd. It seems the staff issues are common at all locations. I order Chili Colorado, Chicken Quesadilla and a breakfast burrito. The cashier and the female cook were going at it with dirty looks and I do understand enough Spanish to know what they were saying to each other. Again there was a problem with the Chili Colorado. The male cook obviously did not want to do it, so he started in on the cashier. I went outside so as not to have to watch the reality tv unfolding in the kitchen. 10 min later my order was up so I grabbed it and hit the door. When i got home it all looked good but the Chili Colorado had a very strong chemical taste almost like soap. The Quesadilla was water logged and slimy from the not draining the chicken. The tortillas were burnt black and smelled of charcoal. The only thing they didn't murder was the burrito. I'm done with Roberto's just hoping I don't get food poisoning for dessert."}
{"text":"Bought 4 orders of 3 roll tacos.  Pretty good but a little bit hard. Nice quick meal but I felt it couldve been prepared with more care but I didn't expect much for rolled tacos.  Use extra chile verde and you will be good."}
{"text":"Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better.   I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos.   9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.  9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!!   The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!    Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas and we were hungry. Craving for Mexican and we looked for near by Mexican food. And we decided to try Roberto's taco shop since it had most good reviews. Well we weren't disappointed we all ordered something different. Carne Alsada chips, carne alsada fries, and carne alsada burrito. They were very good, it had flavor and it was juicy. Not disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places to go to even though there's so many out here employees are always friendly!!!! Food is fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good for a late night mexican craving.  Carnitas taco was very good but a tad dry...still good.  Chimichanga was massive hardly put a dent in it. Will go back!  Employees were super attentive even at 2AM.  Restaurant was spotless."}
{"text":"When you are dying to eat something at 3 in the morning, you can always rely on Roberto's 24 hour taco shop. The standard carne asada fries is really good. The kitchen is clean and well maintained, but you kind of have to since it is open for us to see. The service is really quick! They normally always get our order right but one time they did forget to give us our carne asada fries. At least they had it ready when we came the second time around.  I also like their pickled carrots and jalapenos are really good. I hate how some places cook the carrots and they're all soft so I am happy with the ones here. It is a Roberto's so do not expect anything special."}
{"text":"This location has been open for 12 years. It is the only business that has managed to stay open (it was 2 different restaurants before) The food has always been good for a quick meal. It tastes the same as it did when it opened. I just wished they would include drinks with their combos. The Large soda is over $2.00."}
{"text":"Drive thru service was horrible.   Was rushed off the drive thru radio while ordering. There wasn't even any other people there. Then wen I got to the window, I didn't get a \"hi hello thank you you're welcome bye\" at all. I just got a rude stare, even got an eye roll when I took a second paying exact amount of coins."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS GO HERE! I always order the bean and cheese burrito, the Super nachos, or the 3 taquitos . I love depending on how hungry or what I'm feeling. I feel like they do have cheap prices which is always good. I also love their green chili! Goes great with my food. It is the BEST Mexican fast food place I will goto."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Roberto's? It's cheap, fast, good and always open!  This is my Roberto's of choice. When the trifecta of hunger occurs (ie. hungry, lazy and cheap) I head to this particular Roberto's. I always know I'm going to get something delicious for a good deal.   My favorites include their chicken quesadilla, carne asada fries, California burrito, rolled tacos or breakfast burritos, You can't really go wrong and there's usually a Roberto's on every other corner in town, so it's convenient and a safe bet.   Now I'm craving a taco. ;-)"}
{"text":"My carne asada fries were ice cold. The meat was over cooked and has been sitting. The cheese is rock hard. The fries themselves were white and contained a crunch not from cooking but from actually being raw. All in all the worst carne fries I've ever had. And I will not be returning to this robertos as they have showed me the quality of food they are willing to give their paying customers."}
{"text":"We are new to Henderson..moved here a couple of months ago..and i was craving some good mexican food..and this place is disgusting..there refried beans are horrible.they look fake..processed..out of the can..really bad..and i tried there cheese enchiladas ..and i was so disgusted..i will not be a returning customer"}
{"text":"Stood in front of the register for 10 min before they even acknowledged that I was there standing and it was just because I decided to ask  the girl if they were open.  Food was cold and the pineapple water was nasty"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying  they're so unprofessional and disgusting when myself and my children walked in they didn't say welcome or anything the lady and the man seen us walk in now the reason why we decided to come here is because we're new to nevada and only live  5 minutes away driving distance let me tell you I ordered the hardshell taco and the tortilla shell was so hard that it scrape my gums and my pallet was bleeding and there's so much more I decided to use the restroom and omg I can't believe what I seen in there i was in disbelief but people I seen food and plates in the restroom disgusting right I immediately left and guess what ill never ever come back to this place again I don't recommend for nobody to come here oh and the food had no flavor"}
{"text":"This spot gets the job done. It's cheap, good, greasy Mexican food. This is the closest you'll get to a taqueria. I always enjoy their food and don't ever get sick so I'm sold. I wish they sold agua frescas though, that would be awesome and it would save me a pricey trip to Los Tacos and having to pay over 3 bucks for a taco."}
{"text":"It's your basic taqueria. It's food isn't the best but it does the trick when you're hungry or hung over. I usually go for their numero once which is 3 rolled tacos, beans and rice. Always a good meal when I'm starving or their carne asada fries which is so huge I can never make it halfway. They really should make a half order of this monster. But its' always delish and by far the best in town. Prices are more than reasonable and workers are friendly."}
{"text":"I am always looking for good home made mexican food. This simple little walk up window, wedged between a car wash and a mini mart, is awesome. Fat meaty asada tacos with the perfect match of sauce, onions and tomatoes. I will be returning to this place. (and the gas station attendant said the 2 dollar Tuesday Tacos are a geat deal too!)"}
{"text":"Love this location. Food is always fresh. Friendly staff and clean place. The rolled tacos with guacamole is amazing!"}
{"text":"Got the carne asada fries and they were amazing.  Toppings included guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, beans, and cheese. They gave a generous portion of meat. Will come back to try more stuff when I return to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"They were better before they remodeled and prices went up.  Taco combo #4 and a wet bean & cheese burrito was & $14!  The meat was flavorless.  Bummed because this use to be our favorite place for fast Mexican food"}
{"text":"One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had.    I will never go back.   And the salsa?   You've got to be kidding me.    Did you get it from a can?"}
{"text":"This place is open for 24 hours. For a person on the verge of starvation at 3:30 a.m., this was the perfect place. It's extremely affordable in price. I would even compare some of the items with fast food prices.   Standard service and attitude. I did not expect an outburst of emotion at 3:30 a.m. but I appreciate that you are not lazy and distant. The delivery of the food is fast, I was in and out for only about 10-15 minutes.  As expected from the low prices, nothing is too good to be true. The very affordable prices start to be reflected in the food."}
{"text":"We went here after pokemon hunting at Sunset park last week (this Roberto's is just across sunset park).   I got the taco salad and wifey ordered fish tacos and carnitas tacos... She' a fan of both! The taco salad was pretty good!  We went back last night and wifey ordered the same thing and I got the california burrito. Burrito was huge! I guess it was pretty good, because I was able to finish it. Could not believe it myself! (seriously, it was big!)  Service was good. I wish they offer free chips though like the other Mexican restaurants. Also, they only have 2 kinds of salsa. No pico de gallo (which is my fave!). =(   Glad that this place is open 24 hours a day... Will be back to try other items on their menu... but I'm sure my wife will get the same thing next time (fish taco + carnitas)"}
{"text":"First time eating here and we were very disappointed. Food was bland not  good at all.  Will not be back im better off going to Taco Bell.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly what I honestly liked most about it is that there was someone there who spoke decent English... the young lady took a phone order for me and it was ready when I got there just the way I ordered it... Will definitely return in the future"}
