{"text":"I came here with my daughter in the hopes of finally finding a pizza  place nearby that doesn't cause heartburn, have a hair in it and that doesn't fall apart when you take it out of the box.  I found it.  Bob's is great.  Wholewheat, gluten free, thick or thin crust.  Wonderful.  I recommend this little place, with great pizza, great service, and to top it off keeps your phone number on record so they keep your preferences on a data base so you don't have to go through the ordering process every time.  Thumbs up."}

{"text":"Had cheese pizza and Mediterranean pizza recently. By God, it's absolutely delicious! Really good fresh veggies on the Medi. Much better quality of veg and toppings than you usually see. Great stuff!"}
