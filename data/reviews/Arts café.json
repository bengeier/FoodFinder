{"text":"Great food and also great coffee! The waitress was really polite and nice on our visit, as it was our first time at Arts Cafe. They had a huge variety of teas as well, which I really appreciated as I'm not much of a coffee drinker. Their food is also very good; they use Fairmount bagels (which I am the biggest fan of)! I'd definitely go back to Arts Cafe because they have all the things I want in a cafe: (1) good drinks, (2) good food, (3) good vibes! Great place to get some quick work done while you eat."}
{"text":"Déjà beaucoup de commentaires positifs mais honnêtement leur réputation n'est pas surfaite. Les plats sont sont savoureux et abordables.,la décoration est vraiment très cute, le café très bon et le service très bien sans trop en faire. Parfait pour passer un moment sympa entre amis"}
{"text":"This place is ideal if you like having good tea somewhere that is not a dedicated tea house, with their attention to steap timing and their selection of leaves from Camellia Sinensis.

Besides that, the baked goods are simply amazing. The regular food items are very good, but not quite on the same level of exceptional."}
{"text":"Cheddar appel bluberry scones!! un melange de saveurs surprenant mais un regal. On vous amene le the avec un timer pour une saveur optimale! l'endroit est tres agreable avec de la lecture a disposition. Ne pas manquer si vous etes dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious and creative brunch, great espresso drinks, and a fun ambiance"}
{"text":"Cosy little brunch spot with a shorter line up than most (and a cute little terrace for hot summer days). I can't speak for everything on the menu but the Shakshuka I tried was simple but pretty good. I'd have it again :)

{"text":"Don't come here, this place is too good and I don't want too many people soiling the quiet atmosphere, nor ruining the food with requests for adjustments to their perfect recipes. I did not want to write a review for this place on this basis. However, since my wife is already writing a review, I might as well give mine.

I have no direct comments to give as everything in this place is utterly perfect, so thus I need not ruin the Zen of this temple."}
{"text":"I had come here a few months ago and had quite liked the eggs benedict and the waffle. 

However, after going back again recently, my experience was very different. The waffles we ordered lacked the \"seasonal fruit\" as indicated on the menu, consisting simply of 5-6 blueberries. The breakfast sandwich lacked substance - the \"guacamole\" consisted of a mere tbsp of avocade spread sparsely over the bread, and the taste was quite bland. Also, we were only informed when ordering that the sandwich is no longer offered with a side, as indicated on the menu. However, we were given the option of meat or polenta. At the end, I did feel quite dissatisfied paying $8 for a sandwich that was 90% bread.
 
I've given two stars this time because their lattes and coffees are still quite delicious."}
{"text":"\"I have always been amazed at my contemporaries' lack of finesse, I whose soul writhed from morning to night, in the mere quest of itself\".

the times  are a changing. 

this is a hard review, the old arts cafe (pre renovation) was my favorite spot to while the time away, a box that housed my box for hours on end,  the place had a soul, the walls had ears, the windows had eyes, the coffee was cheap and bottomless, it was a hangout for those who couldn't study in solitary confinement, fully equipped with a silver haired waitress that rivaled some of the greatest women who ever lived, and now, sure, the coffee is better and it's heated in the winter and presumably air conditioned in the summer, and sure the food is executed very well (though $9 fancy but delicious grilled cheese with no side  is still tough to digest), but it has no soul. it's no longer a cafe that feels like part of the community, a place to be for people looking for a place to be,   and although the coffee and food is night and day from its predecessor, it feels like a  vampire went for the jugular and sucked the vivre out of the joint. 


that doesn't make it  a bad place, it just blends in now, with all the other nice cafes that serve good, slightly overpriced food and nice coffee, and if you want a spotless and bright place that serves nice coffee/baked good items you should go there. wait, that doesn't sound so bad.

   -1 star is for the memory of a love long gone, and since i only throw my arms around stone, after much deliberation,  i'll give it a solid yet seething, spiteful recommend. 

do cafes need to be an extension of the patron? with so much time and so little to do, perhaps. it is a cafe for its place and time, so i recommend it  only to people who are for their place and time, but for those among you who are late in time, lost in place, i don't know. in any case, with any place, you must find out for yourself."}
{"text":"J'ai jamais jamais attendu aussi longtemps pour recevoir ma bouffe et qui plus est, un sandwich. Travaillant dans la restauration je sais qu'être dans le jus peut arriver mais là, en 1h30 d'attente personne n'est venu nous pour nous expliquer ce qu'il se passait ni s'excuser pour l'attente. J'ai juste eu droit à un vague \"jmexcuse\" quand la serveuse m'a finalement déposé l'assiette devant moi. Finalement sur les notes ils nous avaient offert les pâtisseries qu'on avait commandé mais sans rien dire, sans un sourire ou un mot d'excuses. Limite gênant cette affaire. En plus ce n'est pas donné pour de la bouffe quelconque. Passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, *delicious* evening menu, all in my favourite neighbourhood in Montreal. Can't wait to try it again for brunch or lunch! When you're in for dinner try the ramen slaw and the scallop and miso - both dishes well beyond what I expected!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely spot I've known for a long time but hadn't visited in a while. I really liked the food and ambiance. The coffee was delicious as well - big plus for any brunch spot. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the service. The waiter serving us was one of rudest I've seen in a while. He couldn't be bothered to explain the menu or remember what we'd had, or even look at us. We all have bad days, but there was no effort on his part. That being said, it is a nice little spot and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Had brunch outside with a few friends there and really enjoyed it!  Great huevos rancheros, nicely seasoned fresh roasted potatoes.  Small salad with unexpectedly classy perfect dressing (in my opinion).

decent value definitely.

Very nice large seating areas both inside and outside.  Friendly staff. 

Good brunch spot."}
{"text":"A neighborhood brunch place with full menu and coffee.  We ordered salmom bagel and benedict.  The salmon bagel was good, and the benedict was average.  However, the SCONE was so tasty!!!  Gosh, so hard to find great scones nowadays.  Scone lovers, must go!  I do recommend this place and I will return for its scone!!!"}
{"text":"L'Arts Café, sis sur Fairmount non loin de l'Avenue du Parc, est emblématique de l'esprit qui bat dans le très artistique quartier Mile-End. Son ambiance mixte de vieux bois rugueux et de meubles noirs presque propres, sans compter son installation décorative en vitrine de vieux globes incandescents, portent la marque impossible à confondre de ce quartier bourgeois-bohème de la première heure.  

L'atmosphère y est bonne, appuyée de la musique indie-trendy des derniers jours. Les cafés y sont goûteux, adroitement concoctés, les pâtisseries fraîches et délicieuses. Tout semble avoir une petite touche de spécificité. Il y a le service aux tables, parfois un peu débordé, des prises de courant en grand nombre et une connexion internet gratuite \" Île-sans-fil \". Cette dernière avait quelques problèmes d'intermittence lors de notre dernière visite. S'il peut faire chaud à l'intérieur en plein été sur le plateau Mont-Royal, la terrasse à l'ombre en fin d'après-midi vous apparaîtra comme un refuge de fraîcheur. Le service est tout aussi bilingue que le quartier lui-même. 

Il y a un menu de nombreux cafés classiques, une liste deux fois plus longue de thés, et quelques items à manger qui valent le détour. Il est également possible de déjeuner ici et l'ambiance agréable devrait être inscrite au menu.

En somme, un café plutôt classique, très bien mené et bien tassé!


À propos du Mile-End : 

Le Mile-End me semble parfois mal porter son nom. Au lieu d'être le cul-de-sac ou l'endroit à l'écart où se sentir à l'abri de la foule, on y entre plutôt comme à travers une porte dans un espace bien fréquenté, mais obéissant à ses propre règles. On s'y sent un peu plus près de  la réalité New-Yorkaise, cosmopolite, de petit quartier enclavé et trop conscient de sa particularité pour être modeste. Plusieurs genres et cultures s'y croisent, mais les plus prédominantes sont la plus grande communauté juive hassidique hors Moyen-Orient, et une bonne part de la classe créative montante de Montréal, une ville dont la scène culturelle fait sa marque à l'échelle internationale."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great brunch. Music is a little too loud to have a normal conversation."}
{"text":"I Had never been to this place and lived in the area 6 months. Now after the first time I've found myself back there 5 or 6 times to eat in under a month. The place has a really great atmosphere, not too loud but often quite crowded especially on weekends.
Having tried a lot of their menu now I can personally recommend the Shakshuka for something savoury and if you have a sweet tooth you can't go past the waffles. They were just amazing!
Their coffee is also great and the staff were very friendly. Their lattes are quite large and I'm not really a fan of that much milk so I've stuck with the cortados or espressos there and have not been disappointed yet.

Be prepared for a small wait if it's a nice summer morning on a weekend. The place is quite popular"}
{"text":"We waited 1:15 for our order. The service was incredibly slow and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, since I've heard a lot about it from some friends and other Yelp! reviews. I think I need to give this place another shot. I had the Shakshuka and I was a little disappointed with it. The tomato sauce and eggs just didn't excite me too much. The merguez that was served with it was tasty though. My bf got the vegetarian sandwich which was very good! Great bread, great hummus and overall great flavor. Definitely recommend getting that! I should have gone with the benedict offering. I saw some other customers order it and it looked both delicious and filling. 

The service was very slow. We ordered pretty quickly and I had to wait about 20-25 minutes for the latte that I ordered and then another 15 minutes for the meal. We did come on a Sunday afternoon at 11 am, though, so it could just be the day.

I also bought some of their coffee, and the person helping me was extremely helpful.

Overall, I need to give this place another try. But if you live in the area, I would recommend coming here to brunch."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas amatrice de brunch, mais je ne peux attendre de retourner chez Arts Café pour me régaler de leur délicieux pain doré aux pommes et de leur café parfaitement corsé. C'est bon, l'ambiance est agréable et le décor est juste assez trendy sans tomber dans le cliché du café hipster. À découvrir!"}
{"text":"Hipster style cafe in mile end. The walls are lined with hanging plants and colorful books, and the menu sports great lunch and brunch options. I got the shakshuka with polenta and it had interesting spices and was really filling with quinoa, bread and polenta. The clientele ranged from 20 something's to 40 something's with people camping out on their laptops working on creative endeavors. Would definitely recommend it for brunch with friends or a cozy cafe to work in for an afternoon!"}
{"text":"Après avoir été pourtant séduit par une récente visite en soirée, merci à la nouvelle carte offerte au souper, j'y suis retourné pour le lunch. Vraiment déçu. Service désintéressé, musique insupportable et un menu qui convient davantage au brunch qu'au lunch. Je mets donc au rancart l'idée d'y retourner sur l'heure du midi."}
{"text":"When you're looking for that perfect afternoon latte, or that trendy weekend brunch spot, you go to Arts Café. 

The coffee is absolute perfection. So good it even managed to convince my non-coffee drinking husband (I know, right!) to order a latte. So velvety and smooth, this coffee might just change your life. 

They also have lovely brunch options. From magret de canard and waffles, to a breakfast sandwich or granola, everything on their menu is fresh and purposeful. I also love their baked goods, especially the scones and jam. Haven't tried their lunch or dinner menu, but judging by everything else I'm sure it's delightful. 

One of the main highlights at Arts is definitely the ambiance. The space is bright and comfortable, without being pretentious. I personally love to come here on a weekday, when it's not too busy to work for an hour or so, and get re-energized. In the summer, they also have a quaint terrace, which is perfect for procrastinating. 

Service seems to be hit or miss, but overall I am a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Cozy, fresh food very near to mile end boutiques. Seems like a favorite local hangout. Great coffee and tea. Excellent breakfast sandwich. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect corner cafe...well worth the wait for brunch on a weekend. Wait staff is great and attentive. Food was terrific. If you like loose leaf tea they have an amazing variety."}
{"text":"Great slightly refined brunch and good coffee, what more could you ask for? You can never go wrong with their eggs benedict plates."}
{"text":"Very trendy place. Decor is artsy and cool. Service was okay. Food was delicious but portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"Cute, cozy, and warm.  Nice coffee house kind of vive.
Brunch and coffee were very good.  They use cute plates.  The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"C'est un endroit que je recommande pour aller travailler ou lire en prenant un café mais pas vraiment pour les repas. La première fois que je suis allée pour prendre un café et un scone, j'ai vraiment apprécié. Cependant,Je suis allée dîner aujourd'hui et c'était moins réussi. Nous avons trouvé nos repas corrects mais sans plus ( slider aux schnitzel de poulet et hamburger). Aussi, le service était plutôt lent autant pour commander que pour recevoir les plats et pour payer. Cela dit, si c'est un endroit où on va  pour prendre son temps, pendant l'après-midi devant un café, c'est parfait. Le décor est vraiment joli et original. Il n'y a pas d'air climatisé, mais c'est très bien ventilé. Aussi, ils ont un petit espace de terrasse à l'extérieur."}
{"text":"We love it! I brought my mom here on a weekday for her last day of visit here. We both love this place's simplicity and lovely decor, along with the cleanliness and efficiency expected of a good restaurant. The wait time can vary depending on the waiter serving you, we started off with a slower (perhaps a newer) waiter who took a while to give us the menu and water. But things started to pick up, when another one came to take our orders and continued to serve us for the rest of the meal. 

The food! The food is amazing! It seems to be a fusion of Middle Eastern cuisine coupled with some Western styled breakfast ideas. My mom had the Vegetarian Sandwich, which was made with walnut falafel and fresh salad on the side. She absolutely loved it (which is a relief because she has the taste palate comparable to a food critic). I had the Shakshuka; it was so delicious and its cumin seasonings were so memorable, I would definitely go back and try some more. 

The menu was not expensive and fairly priced for its great food quality, but a consideration is that some of the dishes may have smaller portion than standard brunch meals. My mother's portion was a little bit more than mine, but I don't eat much so I finished mine and was comfortably full. Usually after finishing big brunch meals, I easily get food coma yet after eating at Arts Cafe, the food made me feel refreshed and energized. This is for sure a place I would hope to return for more."}
{"text":"Un des plus beaux cafés de Montréal.  Les déjeuners sont très bons et les portions parfaites

Bref, une bonne ambiance de quartier, un excellent menu et prix abordable"}
{"text":"A hipster cafe/brunch place on Fairmont with a very nice interior design. It has a very cool row of light bulbs along the windows. The menu was simple and clean. We ordered Arts Burger and Shakshuka for brunch. The Arts Burger is a Burger of mixed pork and beef with some lettuce. It came with a side of greens made of lettuce and what I thought was bok-choy stems. The plate looked anemic. There was no color, just a pale green salad with a pale looking burger bun and patty. The salad was bland, it had a drop of sourness and that was it. Also, why were there oxidized stems? The Burger did taste pretty good.

The Shakshuka wasn't bad; It had one egg and one sausage! Why only one? I like my sausages and eggs. For brunch, I feel there are better options around the area."}
{"text":"Fairmount bagel with gravlax and lemon dill cream cheese - daarooool
Tasty eggs benedict
Beautiful and delicious cortados
Carrot cake soufflé - siiiiigh
Pleasing interior design and warm vibes overall

Despite this clearly being an excellent spot, only in Montreal would a place be this busy on a Monday! I forgot that nobody actually works in this wonderful city."}
{"text":"Tried going there on a Saturday for brunch but there was a huge line up!!! 
So decided to come again but a weekday, Monday at 09am... no line up at all! :) quiet ambiance for a nice breakfast and meeting with a friend. 
Loveee the decor!!!! Lots of lightbulb lighting hanging at the windows, it's pretty neat! 
For the menu, I opted for something different than the traditional egg potato bacon plate. I ordered the \"Shakshuka\": cumin cardamom sauce, quinoa, baked egg, potato toast with choice of merguez
It was really good!!! A good salty plate and finished off with a blueberry scone. Delicious!
Easy to find free parking."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee, great food and baked goods, great interior, great ambiance, great books, great staff."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Mile-End (IMHP). Two reasons: good taste and consistently solid execution."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré le cappuccino, l'ambiance, le service, la bouffe et décor. C'est un sans faute."}
{"text":"Endroit sympa, par contre beaucoup de monde le dimanche et peu de choix de brunchs j'ai trouvé...
A cause du fait qu'il y avait du monde, le service était assez lent...
J'ai pris le sandwich déjeuner, c'était assez petit, avec quelques pommes de terre et un peu de salade...
Apparemment les scones sont très bons"}
{"text":"Arts Cafe renewed my love for brunch food. 
The cafe is adorable inside and out - that patio is not on a busy main street and people watching is perfect while sipping latte or freshly squeezed. Servers are attentive and warm, I'll come back again and again. The whole place has an artsy chilled vibe, a perfect little spot to watch the world go by. 

Cod cake - is delicate and crispy on the outside, the accompanied dill sauce is artfully plated.
Poutine - scallop potato on gooey cheese and tender smoked duck. 
Eggs Benny on brioche - good overall but the blue cheese on sweet potato was the star of the plate. 
Montreal + brunch, qui, qui!"}
{"text":"Me and a GF were looking for the famous Fairmont bagels and when we realized that meant grabbing a bagel to-go, we decided to go elsewhere for a real sit-down breakfast. Arts cafe was just around the corner and happened to feature a Fairmont bagel in one of the entrees!

We sat outside. The service was ok, not especially attentive or quick. We ordered differently so we could both try their cuisine. 

The restaurant inside is very cleverly decorated. Def fits the \"arts\" cafe brand."}
{"text":"Excellent food but slow forgetful service. We came for brunch and tried the shakshuka and the farmount bagel sandwich. Both were excellent - the bagel comes with a very nice lemon cream cheese and fresh capers. I'd prefer smoked salmon as the trout was a bit too subtle. The shakshuka was perfectly spiced and came with a yummy polenta loaf. Though the food was tasty, the wait was not so hot. Minus points for long wait times and slow coffee service."}
{"text":"Poutine and French toast were so good.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Great beer options too. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Bohemian chic. One of my favourite cafés for a cozy afternoon of writing and also a good place for a creative tête-à-tête.

You'll see a glowing apple on the back of a laptop at more tables than not; it's a popular hang-out for writers, artists, and students. They make lovely coffees, and also serve wine and beer if that's more your speed. Some casual, inexpensive meals are also available, in case you get hunger while penning your next novel."}
{"text":"Sipping on my soy latte from Cafe Arts I felt like i was back in Australia again... in more ways than I would like!!

Firsty it had an impeccable crema, which is impressive for soy.
But for $4.50 for a take away coffee! I think I'll shop around.
$4 for a coffee in Australia is pretty standard but I expected more from you mtl.
If there are any yelpers reading this who know here I can get a good latte that's not too expensive, feel free to give me a shout.

As the breakfast options here, they looked divine! If I ever feel homesick one day I will head to Cafe Arts for a soy latte and poached eggs, and find comfort in having to fork out for it."}
{"text":"Nice, warm, artsy little cafe on Fairmount! With a small intimate vibe. Food is fresh and served right away! Staff and service met my expectations! I had a classic breakfast with Merguez Sausage and fried polenta which was absolutely delish!

My 5-stars is for venue, food and service!"}
{"text":"Arts Cafe is a cozy, hip, and bohemian-vibe of a restaurant. Expect long waits on the weekends for brunch but the food makes it all worth it. The portion size is perfect to not overly ruin your remaining of your day at a great price. The food was full of spices, which made it that much more delicious.

Ordered:

1. Shakshuka which came with quinoa, polenta and toasts
2. Duck confit poached eggs poutine style

If you are in the area, a must try!"}
{"text":"Pro: Great lattes. Nice ambience. 

Con: One hour wait for a brunch order. 

Come for coffee or a drink. Classic breakfast tasty with merguez. French toast adequate."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! We are brunch on the outside patio area. We ordered the original breakfast which included eggs, potatoes, vegetables, bacon, and the most delicious toast I've ever tried. All of that food yet the serving was just right. 

The service was incredible. Our waitress was extremely polite and patient with us and our non-French speaking selves. She did not make us feel rushed; but rather made us feel quite welcomed. 

The area where this restaurant is located is quite home-y. The area wasn't crowded and there wasn't any traffic. 

I will recommend to all my friends that visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Top brunch and coffee always. It gets a bit busy on weekends but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent, les brunchs sont délicieux. Un ++ pour le tchaï latte. Et un cadre vraiment joli, design au naturel, agréable est très bien tenu. Belle qualité de service, avec attention et rapide, et un lieu très propre.
5 étoiles pour des prix vraiment bien positionnés, cela mérite le détour."}
{"text":"My friends and I discovered this place while walking by on our way to Mont Royal. Despite a wait, we were seated quickly. The ambiance of the cafe is great, and the food did not disappoint. We split a scone (highly recommend the raspberry!) and we were blown away once our meals came. We each agreed that it was the best brunch we've had in a long time. The French toast is a must-try, and the poutine is delicious. I definitely plan to come back on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"We had a very tasty brunch-Eggs Benedict, fresh salad, sweet potato fries and very friendly service sitting out on the terrace on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"They have a great coffee from Vancouver, their poutine is also tasty. The deco is cosy, with books everywhere and some greenery, which makes it a nice place for a couple."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my bestie and heard about this hip and trendy spot! We shared a rasberry scone which came warm and served with a sweet cream... delicious

My bestie had the cod cakes which came with an egg Benedict, hollandaise sauce, potatoes (chips like) and salad = D-LISSHHHH ( of course I had to try a piece of her cod cake, Im from the Caribbean and we love our seafood)

I had the classic breakfast sandwich which is basically : homemade bun ( I didnt ask but the bun was so fresh and had to have been made in house) egg Benedict, pancetta (which i changed for bacon due to the saltiness of pancetta that I dont really care for) , potatoes (chips like)  , and a green salad.... i requested a classic mimosa to go with my meal... I loooove mimosas and was really happy to see mimosas on the menu ...

Overall, service was great, friendly, and fast!
The ambiance is totally beautiful and trendy .... really artsy and classy and vintage like and i can go on.... you just got head there and enjoy it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Arrived at noon on a Sunday with a group of three. Once seated we waited around for 15 minutes before we had to ask to see a waiter to place our order. Not even a quick visit to take drink orders. 

After ordering it took about 45 minutes to get 2 Classic breakfasts and 1 shakshuka. Overall the food was good however the service spoiled the whole event. To add insult to injury we were charged for refills of coffee (standard filter coffee). 

Do not recommend on a weekend for brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious place to have brunch or breakfast in the mile end. I had the breakfast poutine, and it was divine. A downside is that you have to pay for each cup of filtered coffee (free refills on filtered coffee should be a given, especially in a breakfast place). I'll definitely be returning to try more options on their menu soon."}
{"text":"Had brunch here before I got on a bus to a plane to another plane to another bus to home. REALLY cute place - it feels artsy and fun. There's books lining the windows and they're all actually thoughtfully chosen titles, from art books to classic bohemian, music, and philosophical reads. Good job getting that authentic feel.

The food itself is also excellent, I had a solid breakfast of eggs, think sliced potatoes, merguez, and buttered toast. Everything you want out of a breakfast, and all cooked perfectly. Their filter coffee is excellent too, I even bought a pound of ground coffee to go from them.

Nice spot. Would definitely come here often if I lived anywhere in this country. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I miss the great big stained glass piece and the klezmer jams but have to admit, in its new incarnation the food and coffee served at Arts Cafe is exceptional. Third wave coffee service, incredible big mugs of filter coffee or a perfect latte go great with lovely brunch options like the daily Benedict special (roast cauliflower with garlic hollandaise?! Amazing.)"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and I'd love to come more often but the service is so bad that's I've stopped coming. i had been in for coffee late afternoon a few times and service was slow but we got our drinks eventually. We came again for brunch and waited over 45mins for a table, we were a party of three, the waitress had no control over what was going on and appeared to care even less. It was a mess -after an hour we were starving so we left without getting a table, we told the waitress we were giving up and she seemed to have no idea  that we'd been standing there for an hour. I put it down to a bad day but I went back and it was a similar experience-hopefully they sort out their service soon."}
{"text":"Mon go-to pour un brunch tardif. Le décor est mignon, la nourriture est bonne, et l'ambiance chaleureuse. 

La poutine est ce que je commande le plus souvent. C'est loin d'être (ou de goûter à) une poutine traditionnelle; on y retrouve confit de canard, uf poché, oignons caramélisés, fromage et pommes de terre coupés en tranches minces. Sinon les uf bénédictines, le bagel au gravlax de truite ou le shakshuka sont aussi de bonnes options. Et si vous avez une plus grosse faim, prenez le burger avec pain Kaiser!

Malgré le service un peu lent et distrait, cet endroit saura vous charmer."}
{"text":"No smile from the servers at all, everyone had a poker face. They looked very surprised when I didn't order any drink. The food was nothing more than average. I got basically a sausage in tomato sauce. Won't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Really delicious and fun place! We had just arrived in Montreal for the weekend and I stumbled across this place on Eater Montreal as a great spot for brunch. We came here on a Thursday around 11:30 AM and the 3 of us sat right down. The decor and athmosphere is super cute and trendy - industrial bulbs with greenery and lots of books.

Their food was delicious - I ordered their Fairmount Bagel which was a delicious bagel with Lox - it tasted so fresh and light. My siblings got the Cod Cake which at first looked like it would be super heavy, but again, surprisingly delicious and light. 

For drinks, we also got their Bloody Cesar which may have been the best bloody mary I have ever had - their secret is the Montreal steak seasoned rim! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Un endroit très sympathique dans le Mile End. Parfait pour se détendre avec un petit café ou pour réviser/étudier. J'ai adoré la deco, fait de lampes, le livres et de plantes. C'est sobre et cosy. L'accueil est chaleureux et sympathique."}
{"text":"Trés convivial dans un quartier qui n'a plus besoin de présentation. 
Leur limonade au gingembre est parfaite pour les temps chauds à venir. 
Le service est très courtois et les prix très raisonnables.
Leur sandwich \"Ben Mi\" (genre de sous-marin vietnamien) est surprenant! 
Je vous le conseille fortement!"}
{"text":"The chai latte and spritz cocktail were great. The scone as well. The patio is very nice.
The shakshuka was pretty good. The service was a little slow. With an abundance of amazing brunch places, this place was good, but not great. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"We were staying in the Mile End area and were on the hunt for brunch - I am always keen to find places that expand on the traditional egg brunch dishes by adding a few twists. Arts cafe had a shakshouka on the menu, and it had good reviews so we went. 

Food: I did have the shakshouka - it had a unique clove flavored tomato base, the egg was still oozy when I cut into it (good sign!) and the merguez sausage was good. I liked it. My partner had a more standard dish - eggs and potatoes, with a couple of small polenta bricks, which was fine. I also ordered a cortado and was impressed that it was a high quality drink (often non coffee shops don't quite hit the nail on the head with their espresso drinks). Overall the food gets a 4

Ambience: we went in the day, and the windows were open bringing in the sunlight. It was just the right size and has a bunch of lightbulbs hanging down one wall - I imagine these look really nice lit at night. Ambience gets a 3.5- 4. 

Service: Service was good - our server friendly-ish and efficient despite being very busy. Service gets a 4.

Overall, I'd recommend this place for the food, the coffee and the overall vibe!"}
{"text":"Arts Cafe was recommended by my friend's AirBnb host as a good spot for weekend brunch. It was one of my favorite places that we went, and I would 100% return if I find myself back in Montreal.

The space is beautiful. I loved the wood floor, the light and airy room, and the hanging lights. Even the books scattered around looked interesting: I could imagine myself whiling away a chilly afternoon with a pot of tea and some art books.

The menu looked great, and I'm sorry I couldn't try everything. I loved the breakfast plate I got here: perfectly scrambled eggs, beautiful potatoes and parsnips, buttery toast and baked beans with a side of merguez. It was the perfect start to a long weekend of shopping and sight-seeing. My friend also raved about her smoked trout bagel and coffee. I stuck to tea: also top-notch. I've had a falling out with Earl Grey lately, but their version re-converted me. The tea timer ensured I didn't over- or under-brew it.

The only thing that would make Arts Cafe better is if they moved to Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"This spot screams Mile End. I LOVE it! The coffee, food and decor are spot-on, and the staff is great... however, my last two visits are keeping me from rating a full 5 stars. I usually order the eggs Benny, which are always delicious, but wasn't too thrilled to receive two tiny pieces of toast and overly poached eggs. I also recently tried the poutine, which was absolutely awful. The potatoes were undercooked, the cheese wasn't melted (I think it had been sitting out for a while because everything was lukewarm) and there was barely any flavour.

Aside from that, I really love Arts Cafe. Such a nice restaurant in a wonderful neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Before this place got taken over by new ownership, the olds art cafe was one of the many great weekend breakfast options.

Back then their breakfast menu were named after famous painters, my usual order was \"Le Wood\". They used to have open mike nights of Tuesday evenings and their chalk board had upcoming events.

The new incarnation has not messed with the decor. The menu is very different from before and methinks (not confirmed) they keep changing their brunch menu each week(end). The chalkboard was not there so I am guessing it does not double as a venue anymore.

Because of my bias to the older Arts Cafe, don't use my review as a touchstone. Maybe you will enjoy their fancy brunch offerings.

I did enjoy flirting with the Australian host, unfortunately she is probably back in Melbourne! Oh well, maybe next I'll flirt with somebody from exotic Cairns or Darwin!"}
{"text":"The iced coffee wasn't that great. And the chai tasted more like milk than chai. A bit disappointing. But a cute setting in terms of tables and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"my chocolat was good but it wasn't hot and the service was slow and rude. the place seems nice, crowded but quiet."}
{"text":"It took us a while, my husband and I, to discover Arts Café, but once we tried it, we decided it was one of the best coffee shops in the city and proceeded to return as frequently as possible, in spite of the distance that separates us, Sud-Ouest dwellers, from the feisty Mile-End neighborhood. 

Tastefully decorated and with walls filled with a fair collection of interesting and colorful art and design books, as well as manifestos, Arts Café is zen and inviting, harboring a serene atmosphere whether one visits it in the early morning or the late evening. 

49th Parralel supplies their espresso and all the espresso, macchiato and latte they've served us so far have been perfect.

We've also had the pleasure of trying their cheddar and raspberry scones, served with a side of fresh cream. Until I had Arts Café's scones, I felt very neutral about scones in general. I now know what a scone is supposed to taste like; buttery, fluffy, soft and tasty goodness. All the other scones sold in the city now seem sub-par in comparison!

Arts Café is a haven, and in my humble opinion, one of Mile-End's best coffee establishments."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch twice and was not disappointed on either occasion. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is charming, and the service is good. They serve each tea with timers, which is a plus if you're fastidious about how long you steep your tea. The espresso drinks are pretty good, too, though not the most amazing I've had in Montreal.

The baked goods are pretty great. They look heavier than they are, in fact. I tried a piece of grapefruit cake with basil cream cheese frosting. I could not figure out what was in the icing at first, and when I asked the waitress what was in it, her orgasmic expression was everything: she smiled, tilted her head back a bit in pleasure and said, \"MMm yeah, it's basil cream cheese.\" 

I have also tried the parsnip soup, which was very good, and the breakfast sandwich which came with a nice side salad. All were very delicious, though not quite as memorable as the unique grapefruit + basil cake, that I will definitely be trying to recreate on my own some time!

If you go on the weekends, be prepared to wait! Though service in Montreal is definitely not super speedy, be prepared to wait for your food a bit, too, as the kitchen is very tiny."}
{"text":"Pour le connaisseur, c'est un peu comme un Café Myriade, niveau qualité de café, mais avec une belle surface intérieur et une belle terrasse! Il y a un petit menu bistro pas trop cher et de très bonne pâtisserie fraîche en constante production! Ils offred aussi une sélection de boisson froides pour les chaleurs d'été. Ils vendent le café qu'il utilise aussi en sac de 1Lbs (454gr) pour 19$. Je vais fort probablement y retourné, si j'étais du coin, je pense que j'irais là de façon régulière."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place great coffee. Food that looks like art. And a chill coffee bar vibe. I've had everything on the menu and so far would have to say order anything you won't be disappointed.  

Also get a scone the jams are homemade and served with a decadent clotted cream. 

Will be back here when I come back to Montreal"}
{"text":"Food was fine, but the subpar service stood out more than anything else. The restaurant was less than half full on a Monday morning. Very long wait, no servers interested in taking our order. A simple request for butter to come with a blueberry scone was met with a bit of attitude and quite a wait as the server took a table's order and cleared another first. Many better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"À essayer si vous êtes à la recherche de variations intéressantes au brunch traditionnel (tout en restant en terrain connu!). Les ufs bénédictines, avec patates douces et fromage bleu, valent le détour. Aussi, les pains et brioches viennent de la boulangerie Guillaume. Par contre, gardez en tête que les portions sont assez petites pour le prix et qu'aucune boisson (café ou thé) n'est incluse. Le décor est assez trendy et \"fit\" parfaitement avec ce qu'on s'attend du Mile-End. Terrasse disponible en été!"}
{"text":"Pas de bonjour, zéro communication - sans même parler d'une mini attention - des cafés servis à 5 minutes d'intervalle l'un de l'autre, une assiette \"classique\" avec des ufs et des pommes de terre quasi froids... 
Si j'y retourne ? Non merci (et vu le mécontentement d'autres clients, je ne suis probablement pas la seule)."}
{"text":"I don't know if I could write a fair review based on having had one hot chocolate there, so please proceed with caution. 

I went with a girlfriend on a Friday night. We got there at about 8.15, so we only had 45 minutes before they closed. The waitress was really, really friendly and we didn't feel like she wanted to kick our butts out when it was nearly 9 either. The decor is adorable. Lots of hanging lightbulbs placed in proximity with each other somehow create a pleasant effect. Very artsy indeed. The vintage wood chairs and tables only add to the charm. I like! 

However, the hot chocolate was disappointing. First it wasn't warm enough, so it was hard to get those sugar cubes to dissolve. Second, the taste just didn't cut it. Nowhere near what can be called hearty and full-bodied as what hot chocolates should be. 

I would go back though, for sure. Just not for the hot chocolate."}
{"text":"I have long heard about this artsy café on the Plateau and there I go, I finally got to try it! I had a matcha latte that was quite good and my friend enjoyed her cappuccino, the place was quite unique in the sense that the interior decor is so special and each wall has different highlights elements. The iconic part is the rainbow colour blocks, just love it! Didn't get the chance to try the brunch yet but judging from the mouthwatering smell from tables around us, I need to come back and try their food!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe in the mile end. The funky and eclectic decor make the place feel nice and energetic.
Came here on a weekday afternoon with the thought of it being a 'study' cafe - it isn't (no wifi or outlets), but I was still able to get work done as the chatter and feel in  the cafe were nice and lively. 
Had the cider (nice and light!) and the trout and and dill cream cheese bagel, the presentation was absolutely beautiful and it tasted just as great! 
The service was also excellent.
Am definitely excited to come back and try more off the menu, all the items have great ingredients and sound delicious. The cocktail menu also looks great. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent. Leurs ufs Benedict sur une tranche de brioche super épaisse de la boulangerie du coin, parsemée de bleu, la petite frisée et les frites de patate douce...
L'espresso est nickel, serré à souhait.
Le cadre est un peu trop maîtrisé pour être vrai avec sa guirlande aux milles ampoules mais ça marche. Prévoir d'arriver tôt pour éviter de piétiner dans la queue."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service abit slow. Our waitress was also not so peachy. But the food and ambiance is great. Definitely will keep going back. Maybe we ll get another waiter...."}
{"text":"What a gem! We stopped here for brunch after hearing there was a 45 minute wait for Lawrence down the street - and we're so glad we ended up here. The decor is what made us stop in - it's filled with plant life and shelves lined with old books, making it feel so homey. 

I had the shakshuka with polenta, which was crispy and delicious. The shakshuka itself was great too. It was a small portion size, but it was just the right amount to leave you feeling satisfied. 

It was pretty packed for brunch but if it's quieter during off hours, I imagine it would be a nice place to stop for a hot drink and a good book."}
{"text":"Café presque vide à mon arrivée. 10min pour avoir le menu, 15min pour avoir mon café... Service vraiment pas fou. 
Mais la place est tres sympa dans ce quartier que j'aime tant !"}
{"text":"Since I didn't have a chance to try Poutine in Montreal, I was really excited when our last stop at Arts served breakfast Poutine (duck confit, poached egg, caramelized onion, fingerling potato, cheese curds, hollandaise).
I was disappointed that it wasn't traditional poutine style, but it was still good. The duck was crispy yet juicy. The melted cheese was delectable. 
My biggest problem was that the egg was way over-cooked. The runniness of the poached egg would have added a great dimension of flavor to the dish."}
{"text":"I love this place, visited it many times. The coffee is great ant the food is extremely tasty. They even have their own version like a real cousin. The place is well decorated and they gave spacial touch to everything from the toilet to the dining area. Looks hipster but feel like an elite cafe, give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best lattes I've had. Some of the worst service too. Very cute spot though. I'd prefer to go somewhere else in the end because of the bad-ittude."}
{"text":"It's my go-to place whenever I have out-of-town visitors: the coffee is approved by my Vancouver coffee snobs, the dessert and decor are approved by Swiss and Norwegian and finally the food is approved by french and Chinese :). My favorite is the brunch. Our waitress was extremely nice which is rare in this hipsterland. There might be a lineup on the weekend but nothing crazy like the other popular (but disappointing) brunch places nearby."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourite brunch/coffee spots. However, some of their staff is very very rude. If the management thinks that people will come to this place back no matter what, they should think twice. Montreal is a small place, and people know what's going on. I have experienced horrible attitude from the servers two times and heard/read many things on Instagram regarding the servers and service. 

They have to get their act together. There're many other brunch spots out there. + I'd rather pay for a decent food and a friendly service rather than eating at \"the\" popular spot."}
{"text":"Years ago this used to be the place where a lot of my unemployed artist friends would land semi-permanent serving and cooking jobs- the space and food reflected this mentality and was a good time but definitely nothing fancy.

As much as the space will forever be remembered as such in my mind, I love what Arts Café has become. The coffee, service, space and above all, food are great. The first time I was back recently I ordered the shakshuka with the polenta and was really impressed with the delicate composition of the dish (they use quinoa!) along with the perfect portions. The next time I ordered the simple breakfast, and while I could have gone for a bigger plate, I really enjoyed my meal.

The big win for this place for me is that they serve a great brunch all week long. If your weekend is an unconventional one like mine, this place is a dream."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service and strong coffee in a beautifully decorated cafe - can't ask for anything more!"}
