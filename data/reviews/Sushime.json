{"text":"We came here tonight for a few pieces of sushi when those cravings hit nothing else will satisfy. I have to say the place was clean and cute. It was a shame we were the only people in there! They have selected sushi rolls for $1 which is awesome. We had spicy salmon, tuna, and crab rolls for $1 and they were all really good. Mine were extra spicy as I tend to go overboard with the wasabi.   We also ordered the Leelee roll with cream cheese inside along with tempura shrimp. I really liked it my boyfriend was meh on it but I thought it was good. We will be back. I gave a 3 based on what I ordered had we ordered more sushi I would have given more. The place is nice and simple and the staff is happy. We really enjoyed our quick sushi fix this evening and will be back to see what else Sushi Me has to offer our taste buds."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi me. I think it's much better than Kinjo or Globefish. It doesnt look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter, but its definitely worth a stop. I like that the rolls arent a bunch of rice, you can eat more without being filled up right away. Which also keeps you full longer after your meal. The special rolls also are a great price for what you get. The staff are warm and friendly, and nothing beats the orange they slice and cut for you to have after your meal!"}
{"text":"Dropping into the north-west corner of the complex that holds Value Village, SushiMe was a great change from our usual south end noodle lunch.   Room was fairly nondescript but warm and pleasant. Service was was super friendly and quick, with an avocado roll coming out within a couple minutes of ordering to satisfy a hungry toddler.   The menu itself was not terribly extensive (and didn't seem to include the customary paper checklist for nigiri, maki, or hand-cones...though we were given a pencil...much to my toddler's delight). An advertised special for $1 pieces of common nigiri sushi had been extended into April, so this made the bulk of our lunch. Fish was fresh and generously cut; inari came studed with sesame seeds and a nice schmear of wasabi. This was a great value, definitely bigger and better quality than the other local dollar place, though I'm not sure what the prices will jump up to after April.   Creative rolls in the other hand seemed expensive and not terribly creative across the board (lots of variation on crab stick and shrimp tempura). We had a mango, shrimp roll that was well composed and tasty, but at $10.95 a touch more than I'd like to pay.   Definitely worth a stop (especially given the sushi situation in the south) but make sure to stop in before the end of April to hit the dollar sushi deal."}
{"text":"Although I rated this restaurant a 3 it is likely that it is going to become a strong 4 as I explore it more. I do not live in the Midnapore area so I do not get to this unassuming little spot as much as I'd like to. If I happen to be working in the area I will generally stop in for lunch, tea and some note writing (working lunch). Half way through I've realized I haven't tried enough of the menu and I'll order more for dinner that I pick up later! Staff here always smile, the are soft spoken, considerate and competent. The food is consistently fresh, reasonably priced and thoroughly enjoyable. The tako yaki is my favourite and only way of eating octopus though Mike says the tako sashimi is good too. The BBQ squid is different then the typical ika yaki and I like different. There are specials - often and currently $1.00 sushi pieces! Be adventurous here and you will be delighted - the food won't disappoint you. The rolls are simple, not transformed too far beyond the fish, nori and rice which is lovely. The more I come the more I will try and the higher this restaurants rating is likely to be."}
