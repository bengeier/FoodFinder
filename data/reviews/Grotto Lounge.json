{"text":"The decor - funky, trendy... but place was confused. Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Loud thumping dance music @ 7:30pm made us want to chew to the beat and leave fast!   Salads started out great - but who can screw up a salad?  For the main - My date had lasagna - nice mid-east flair with addition of cinnamon. I had what was supposed to be the seafood risotto... chewy overcooked octopus, rice was soooo bad it falls into the grain of shame. I suspect rice was boiled previously, then sauced after the fact.  Service - quick, attentive, friendly - very good... but it would have been helpful to be told in advance that 1/3rd of their menu - pizza - was not available BEFORE ordering.  Recommended if you're looking for a place to hang with friends for drinks and light munchies."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and we are avid brunchers. What can we say? We love breakfast food! We've hit all the 'traditional' breakfast places in the area and we started expanding to places that offer brunch on the weekend. Enter Calisto.  My husband had the french toast and cappuccino. I had the burger w/salad and rosemary potatoes.  He enjoyed his french toast and his cappuccino (which had the largest head of foam I've ever seen and came with a small biscotti). The french toast came with apples and an individual syrup container. Good for my sweet toothed hubby!  My burger was very tasty. The patty was a good size, nicely seasoned, and wasn't too dry or too juicy (I'm not a fan of an overly juicy burger). The homemade bread and chili mayo turned a good burger into a really tasty burger. The salad was good: spring greens with a light vinaigrette. The potatoes were super tasty: red potatoes with rosemary and butter. yummy! The only change I would have made was to have my chili mayo on the side so I could cut back a bit on the heat! ole!  Our waitress was very nice although a bit overworked. There was another party in the restaurant that had to flag her down for their bill after waiting quite a while. However, by the time she was dealing with us she was on time and very prompt with everything.  The atmosphere is also nice. We sat near the front, so we didn't get the full 'cavern'/wine cellar effect the place seems to be going for. Although it seems like it would be a nice atmosphere for an evening out.  One point of confusion was with the menu. We thought it said \"salad and potatoes with all above items\". Apparently it did not include my husband's french toast. The toast was plentiful, but he was disappointed to not have the salad and potatoes.  The burger was $8.75, which I think is a pretty good deal considering how good it was and the amount of food. I can't remember the price of the french toast, but I believe it was also under $9. A good deal for some tasty food!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but I am rounding up to 3 stars since our waitress was so nice.  We went to Grotto for dinner on a Thursday evening and I have some good and some bad to report.  Good: - I really liked their decor - the stone wall theme was very suitable to their new name without feeling cold. - Our waitress was great.  She was very friendly and attentive to both of us and our toddler. - The food was good.  We ordered the gnocci quattro formagi and the grilled chicken breast.  Both entrees were prepared very well and we really enjoyed it.  Not so good: - Our food choices were actually not what wanted to order in the first place. We asked for two of their pizzas and were told they were not serving ANY pizzas although they had been on the menu. - The food took FOREVER to come out.  If they hadn't served free bread, I don't know what we would have done with our hungry child. We were waiting for over an hour and the restaurant wasn't even that full. - The portions were rather small.  The chicken came with 2 pieces of asparagus and that was it."}
{"text":"NOTE: This is not a review for the restaurant, since I have not actually eaten food here.  I have been to this place several times but not for dinner or food but for events downstairs. When you first come into Calisto, you see the dining room area but you would be surprised to know that in the basement they have a full dance bar. The bar is long ending at a small sized dance floor with a DJ booth in one conrner. If you are looking for a small place to host a party or just go out with some friends, Calisto is the place for you. The drinks are normal Toronto prices. The music is a good mix of stuff. Sometimes people throw special events in there and you may stumble upon something really interesting. The staff is friendly and there is usually no cover (I have never heard of anyone paying cover).   I do like this place and feel pretty comfortable there, so will you!"}
