{"text":"Overbooks on Groupon deal and under allows the reservations. Impossible to get a reservation there if you have paid for a deal. You can call and reserve a place or show up and there is room, but if you have a paid voucher you're out of luck. all of a sudden they are full. 

Scam."}
{"text":"On the plus side, the tempura, soups, salads and sashimi were quite good and decently fresh.

The big disappointment was the sushi, which was bland to the point of being inedible. The main problem is that the chef does not use proper, seasoned sushi rice, but instead uses plain white sticky rice, which is not the same thing. The result is very dry and flavourless.

They also shove way too much cucumber in their sushi and not enough of anything else. In addition, they put out very cheap soy sauce that is watery and not very flavourful. The service was also not amazing, and we had to ask twice for wasabi (which should be served automatically with any sushi plate.)

Overall, if you can make a meal out of sashimi, tempura, and sides, this is not a terrible all-you-can-eat deal.  But for the actual sushi, better to stick to Kanda."}
{"text":"I agree with  Kyrie M from Montreal. I went there tonight with my Groupon voucher but my friend and I both agree that it was even worth the 50% off...

The food was bad and not fresh.
The place was clean.
Tip was automatically added on.  The service was weak and slow so they stuck on the mandatory tip to ensure themselves. 
The reservation was ridiculous....apparently, we required a 1 week reservation. 

I would recommend it and would not go back."}
{"text":"The combos are a rip off and the sushi is very mediocre. Had the sashimi combo, out of the 11 pcs of sashimi, 4 were pieces of egg and fake crab. Fish is not that fresh and portions of it are stingy."}
{"text":"Send Gordon Ramsay to this place, it a kitchen night mare!
Nasty food, slow service and cheap decor. So many better all you can eat sushi in MTL."}
{"text":"Some of the sushi were ok... But the overall food was nasty :(
Smoked salmon smelled fishy and chicken tasted almost out of date
Fried calamari and sushi were burned 
You dont even get unlimited ice cream :/ 
Never coming back."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, because there are only 2 waiters, so expect to wait a long time for your food if you go on a Friday night. The fishes they used for the sushi weren't very fresh, and some of their cuisine dishes are tasteless. In addition, if you want to have more choices in your menu, you have to pay some extra dollars for the \"VIP menu\", ridiculous."}
{"text":"I like it for lunch. Not expensive. I usually have the tempura fried shrimps and veggies which is yummy. The general Tao hits the spot. I don't really go there for the sushi. 

Service is pretty quick at lunch time."}
{"text":"I had a great time at komiko! The waitress was very friendly, and the food tastes good(it takes long though, get ready to wait). Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a cold first night out in Montreal. I was debating between 3 to 4 stars on this one. It's a four if you are really hungry like I was (and all you had to eat all day was a nasty sandwich on the 12-hour amtrak train). The place was really empty for a all-you-can-eat place. They have ridiculous amount of options and all of them are pretty decent. Highlights of the night-

-My boyfriend liked the vegetable soup since it was light and flavorful. 
-We are both huge salmon fans so we ordered 20+ pieces of salmon sashimi and devoured all of them. 
-The beef teriyaki is really tender.

I recommend this place if you are hungry! If you are a sushi/sashimi snob you might not like this place very much. This place will cost $50+ for two with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I took the spicy ramen. It was pretty disappointing as it tasted like water with spices. Its as low quality as you can get. My girlfriend took sushi deluxe which includes some sashimi, some hosomako and some futomaki and it was also very terrible. She had shrimp sashimi..., fake crabs and 2 pieces of salmon. The sushi rolls had rice outside and inside of the seaweed sheet making it mostly rice and seaweed with small piece of fake crab.

I dont think anyone should go here by choice."}
{"text":"Bon, j'avais dit que je n'y retournerais plus, mais comme c'est près du bureau et que certains collègues aiment bien cet endroit, j'y suis retourné à quelques reprises. 

Pour le positif, le service, quoique relativement lent, ne l'a jamais été autant que lors de mon précédent avis. Même que lors de notre dernière visite. Nous étions un groupe de 25 et nous n'avons jamais été servis aussi rapidement.

Sinon, personnellement, je ne suis toujours pas super fan de la nourriture. Pas mauvais, mais rien qui mérite un détour. Mais ça dépanne lorsqu'on est dans le coin."}
{"text":"I want to this restaurant a couple of times now, and I have to say it's a bit disappointing. The freshness is there but it looks like the quality of the food is not at top level, meaning they it's not very tasty. Big kuddo to the waiter though who is absolutely awesome!!! He is the highlight of the place, really. 

Food: 2 stars
Service: 5 stars
Atmosphere: they should hold back on the air con a bit so we don't freeze in the restaurant, otherwise it is ok: 3 stars"}
{"text":"We shared the all you can eat $20 special.  There were plenty of things to choose on the menu.  We ordered several types of dumplings (stay away from the peanut (sauce) dumplings) and fresh fish slices.  They had no tuna roll on the menu, but we were happy with everything else.

Just know that you'll end up paying $50 minimum for two all you can eat 
specials.  Come hungry.  Also $1 is added to the bill for everything uneaten.  This means don't order the peanut dumplings if you don't think you'll like them...

Lastly, take a trip to the bathrooms... they're themed."}
{"text":"Also went using a Groupon deal, which allowed me to pick from the VIP menu (more choices).
Compared to my favorite sushi places, which are Sushi 999 and Sushi Palace (both in Chinatown and Longueil locations), the service was 2x as slow and their sushi had 2x as much rice.  And I don't go to all-you-can-eat sushi for thick coatings of rice.  Or go on a not-busy weekday evening to pick at my soy sauce while waiting for each order.

They also only allowed 1 serving of ice cream for dessert and it was their only dessert choice.  It was not even on the menu- you had to ask the waiter for it.  Not a terrible flaw but doesn't give this place extra points."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place despite only 2 reviews. It was our first day in town and this place was near our hotel. We eat sushi often and were really not sure what to think of this place. We were given the AUCE menu at first and it took a bit to get the regular menu. There was only one server for the whole place but she hustled her butt off. AUCE is the deal if you are hungry for sushi but we weren't so we went with the eel bento, tempura veggies, and udon. Tempura was good but not outstanding and the udon was very good. The eel was the hit of the night and we fought over it. Yum!

We ordered a large saki that ended up being a huge saki! Thank god we only had to walk a few blocks. 

Overall, food was very good, service was slow but with good reason, and she was very accommodating with our very limited French, the space is large and nicely done, and the prices are reasonable. Definitely had things on the sushi menu that we don't get in the States, but we didn't get to try them."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the interior looking quite upscale and classy. The tables and chairs were matched really well with the wallpaper and lamps. The paintings, equipped with individual lighting, were the icing on this fantastic interior design. And the music was very appropriate. When I was there, it sounded kind of jazzy. If you take any delight at all in the finer things in life (ex. wine, art, classical music), you won't be disappointed with the way the restaurant has been set up inside. With that said, it's an ideal place for a romantic date. I saw a businessman in full suit walk in with a dressed-up lady, whom I presume were on a date.

Our server was very friendly. When we received a dish we didn't remember ordering, he brought us the paper menu on which we ticked off our choices to confirm that this was indeed our dish. I appreciated that he counted how much we ordered initially so that we weren't ordering more than we could handle (we were having all-you-can-eat). The sushi was similar to that offered in many small sushi businesses back in British Columbia (and everyone knows how it's much easier to find higher-quality sushi in BC). One roll particularly stood out for me. There were just as many tempura crumbs rolled up as the rice, and in the center was a piece of sashimi. Combined, it tasted creamy and chewy, and the sashimi gave my taste buds a \"sweet punch\". The price of the all-you-can-eat sushi here, about $30, is reasonable in Montreal. 

There's a surprise waiting in the women's washroom. Depending on your cultural background and personality, this surprise may either be cool or bizarre. If you're a man, you can still see it because the men's washroom is right beside the women's and the door for the latter is usually kept wide open."}
{"text":"I totally agree with all the bad reviews here. Do not go there.
Worst sushi buffet I've ever had. The sashimi was not fresh and very thin. The beef terriyaki tasted like boiled beef with terriyaki sauce. The oil they used on fried foods like shrimp tempura was not fresh too.  It was very cold that day, so we asked for hot water or tea. The server gave us the tea. And I never realized they charged 10 dollars for the tea until I payed. :( They could just gave me some hot water. 

I totally agree with all the bad reviews here. Just do not go there. Everything there was below average."}
{"text":"I walked into this place about 2pm for a late lunch on a rainy afternoon. The restaurant facade and decor looked well put together, but the place was completely empty. 

I had the orange chicken set, while my friend ordered a shrimp bento box.  The miso soup came out first and while initially savory, it quickly became apparent that it was too salty and should have been watered down a bit more.  The orange chicken came up next and was not what I expected, but I was still keeping an open.  Unfortunately it too had enough salt to pickle me.  It tasted of burnt marmalade and was served with a watery slightly sweet sauce on the side, that I couldn't find a good use for since the chicken was already covered in a thick brown sauce. 

On the other hand, my friends shrimp looked amazing and he said they were tasty.  I tried a piece of his sushi roll and it was a bit small but otherwise good. 

So the moral of this story is go with the sushi and go during peak hours or you'll be wondering if the place is even open."}
{"text":"Great miso soup...BUT.
The least fresh sushi I've had.
'twas truly awful."}
{"text":"I visited on a groupon and was worried about all the bad reviews. The staff were very friendly but yes, very, very slow. Besides that, the decor was cute and simple. yes I recognized the Ikea Expedit units but I own 2 anyways so I can't hate their functionality. Unlike some other all you can eat sushi places we were actually delivered everything we ordered. They brought it to our table in reasonable batches but a little bit too slow. The sushi itself was quite tasty and I was pleased that they didn't try adding extra rice as filler. We certainly didn't consume $50 of sushi between the two of us, but it was filling and tasty none the less. 

**Tip is already included on your receipt!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. Went there with an all-you-can-eat groupon which entitled us to as much as we wanted from an impressively wide range of things (soups, salads, dumplings and tempura included, though we mostly saved room for sushi). Seafood miso soup and tempura veggies were both awesome to start, and we were very happy with all the sushi we ate as well. The \"sushi pizza\" (which is effectively a fish cake, I guess) was super crunchy and delicious. It wasn't very crowded even though it was a Friday night, so everything came pretty quickly and service was fine. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We were fooled into eating at this restaurant by a groupon deal. Being Chinese ethnicity myself, sadly most of these Japanese all you can eat restaurants are being poorly run by Chinese people who have no Japanese culinary sushi skills....sad but very true. It took almost 45 min to receive our second order of food we placed, the sushi rice was hard with no flavour, the nigiri sushi had paper thin slices that resembled smoke salmon, and the SOYA SAUCE was watered down (I don't know if this a Montreal thing but this is not the first time I've experienced that). Please STAY AWAY. I don't understand why this place is still open? Absolute garbage and a waste of time."}
{"text":"I stand by my previous review. Really enjoy my time here. Food is hot and tasty. Friendly service! Lovely ambiance!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday nite supper and i must say it was good. I got the all u can eat buffet for 22$. They have a good selection and service is fairly fast. One thing that would made it better would have been better soya sauce. It tasted like it was watered down. It was close to my hotel and I may come back again, but only if I stay near by as I would try somewhere else if not."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday evening, there were enough tables, it wasn't a problem. (+1 star) 

But it was a warm summer evening. The AC was clearly not on, or not working or non existant. 
The water they served was at room temperature with no ice. 

The sushi were decent but there was too much rice and some pieces were extremely big. But you order your sushi the same way you'd do anywhere else and it becomes difficult to finish. Thank God people could get take out so instead of paying a $1 fee for each uneaten sushi, we got some take out. (+1 star) 

Then, the service was not more than what you'd expect, so less than average. But here is where it went wrong. When it was time to pay, the girl never said anything about the tip being already included in the total. I was paying with my credit card and there was the option to tip, which I did. So I ended up paying 15% of a total that already had a 15% included. They never said anything. I only realized it when I got home. 

Do not go there, stuck to your favourite all you can eat sushi places."}
{"text":"They were out of salmon ( weird for a sushi place) service is limited, didnt even ask us once if everything was okay, no eye contact whatsover so that you can ask her to take your order.
When we received the sushi, surprisingly there was salmon on some of them, made me doubt about the freshness. And I confirmed by the taste, I've almost immediately had a stomach discomfort.
I wouldn't recommend that place unless its during lunch I heard its okay.
Sorry !"}
{"text":"J'ai eu une excellente expérience chez eux! Le personnel était attentif et courtois. La nourriture était délicieuse. Le service plutôt rapide pour un vendredi soir! Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Was gifted a living social deal so had no excuse not to try this place out.

The restaurant was elegant, clean, but a bit cold (need to crank the heat up).

Service was good. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The sushi was good. Some up and downs though: one of my salmon cuts was a bit old, and the other very fresh. Same thing happened with a veggie tempura: one was crisp and clean and the other soggy and old. There was a good selection, smaller in comparison to other all you can eats, with good composition and flavors.

The one down side I would have to say was the speed of service. Compared to other all you can eats, it was rather slow. We waited approximately 20 minutes before getting our first order in.

Overall a good all you can eat experience, but if you want faster service with higher selection of sushi/food with comparable friendly staff and setting, I would highly recommend Sushi Crescent."}
