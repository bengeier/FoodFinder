{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant so far! The food, prices, portion, and service is amazing. My favorite thing to get there is definitely the orange chicken(you should try it). This place has a very chill and welcoming atmosphere, so it is a great restaurant for the family."}
{"text":"I have been going to Panda's Den for many years. They are a good take-out place. Sit down is ok, and as one reviewer noted, the service is always over the top. The food is consistent and you can count on the dishes being what you expected - a favorite will be the same the next time."}
{"text":"They are authentic Chinese food! Oh my god I've been to Charlotte for several months and this is the ONLY one has great perfect Chinese food. Service is also marvelous. I high recommend to all."}
{"text":"The best Chinese place in Charlotte! Been coming here for years, family owned and quick service! Always refill drinks before you even notice you're low. The moo shu chicken is delish!"}
{"text":"I stopped going to the Panda about twelve months back.  It seemed that after Bob retired that the service and quality had decreased.    Today I decided to give them another try and by Georgio, I think they have the touch back.  My two favorites have always been the Hot and Sour Soup (the best in all of Charlotte - I even tried to buy the recipe!) and the Hunan Beef.  So that is what I ordered for lunch today - my two most favorite Pandas Den dishes.  Service was very good today.  The food was heavenly.  The atmosphere was quite (my favorite sound in any restaurant).  I found myself sitting and drinking hot tea for some time after my meal.  It was a good experience.  I will definitely start going more often and using them for meetings and gatherings again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Chinese.. Just didn't like the sweet and sour chicken.. But that was because it was already in the sauce.. But the rice, perfect! Still yet to find my go to Chinese place here in Charlotte that is a good substitute for my Boston, MA Chinese, but this place is very solid. I'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"I need to give it a high rating because it can count as the best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte University area.   The owner is always very nice and humorous, and service come check you and add water very often!  Good food to go: Pork Rice Combo, Three Cup Chicken, Onion oil Cake, Vegan Chicken, Ants Tree, Soup......So many"}
{"text":"Food is always great, service ect, the best. Value the best. Love this Chinese restaurant. No other Chinese restaurant comes close."}
{"text":"Panda's Den is as good as it gets for American Chinese food in Charlotte. Try the honey walnut chicken - it is excellent!!!!  The only reason I only give it four stars instead of five is that takeout doesn't ever seem as good as what you order in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese for the money, its not spectacular, but it is good, especially the Sesame Chicken and the Shrimp Lo Mien.  The food is a little greasy, but the portions are big and the rice is good. There are definitely better quality Chinese restaurants in Charlotte, but if you're in the University area and needing some Chinese, this place will scratch the itch."}
{"text":"I love going to this place they have really good authiec Chinese and Taiwanese food. There food are good and really big portions. The sever are really nice and the manger there is super nice and awesome. They staff treat you really well. I try to come here often as I can:"}
{"text":"A step above the rest in Charlotte area cheap/fast Chinese food.  YELP TO THE RESCUE!!!  As I'm driving way down Harris Blvd one day around lunch time, I get a hankering for my weakness.  Cheap Chinese lunch.  As soon as I whip out my yelp app, not only do I see a well rated place close by, but a place that is well rated by no other than Chad E!  Oh, I was excited.  Chinese restaurants near the not so nice side of town are always hit or miss, and this one was almost perfectly spot on.  I went ahead and read some other reviews to get an idea of what I may want.  One yelper said that hey loved the hot and sour soup and the Hunan beef so much he had bribed the owner for the recipe, so I gave it a shot.  My waiter, was soooooo fast.  Almost stalky, but not in a bad way since it was lunch time.  I drink a lot of water and I don't think it was ever less than half full.  The soup came quickly.  The first couple bites were great, rich, and perfect with the crunch of the noodles I put in.  Although, It did get a little overly salty towards the end.  My Hunan beef came shortly after.  Beautifully thick looking sauce and a nice portion sized per $.  I took my first bite hoping for the best and it was soooooo close.  Amazing flavor for a quick cheap spot, but yet again over salted and that was pretty much the story of the meal.  Even the eggroll tasted overly salty.  That is the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars in my book.  Maybe I was off kilter, maybe my taste buds were overly sensitive, that did come to mind once the eggroll wrapper tasted so briny.  I guess I'll have to back and find out.  Anybody want to join?  They have a lunch for 2 special, 3 things off the menu, to rices, and 2 eggrolls for less than $14.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have been driving across town, passing many other Chinese restaurants  for Panda's Den for many years. Prepare to be \"serviced\" to death and thats a good thing. Quick service, great food, especially their Hot and Sour soup and  mu shu, pork and beef. You probably cant get 4 sips from your iced tea before they are there filling it up. Great for lunch, dinner or takeout too.."}
{"text":"Always excellent service, whether eating in or stopping in for take out. Love the hot and sour soup and the house special lo mein"}
{"text":"I must say the service is top notch. Never have I experienced such superb service at a Chinese take away restaurant. Smiles, attentiveness, greetings... These are a few of my favorite things when it comes to good service.   Now as for the food. Apparently, you don't have to be at Burger King to have it your way. I wanted broccoli, snow peas, and and another veggie in garlic sauce... I got it. No: \"That's going to be extra cost\" or \"We can't do that\". I got what I want.   It was good too. Nothing to run screaming in the streets over but good.   The tea was aight and I tried a rib... \"Just one rib\" It was good.   I may actually dine in one day. Did I tell you how good the service is?"}
{"text":"I went there several time. It's definitely a choice for you. But it's not like you want to go there everyday. Still, they've got good food there."}
{"text":"Definitely the best \"traditional\" (i.e. non-Americanized) Chinese food I've had in Charlotte. I came here on Christmas and ordered two dishes off the Chinese-language menu. I had to order based entirely on the pictures since I couldn't read the menu, but I was very satisfied with both things I got. The appetizer was a spicy beef tripe dish. I don't usually eat tripe, but I liked it. The main dish was lu rou fan, or ground pork over rice. It was delicious and would have been enough for more than one meal on its own, and it came with an egg, tofu, cooked vegetables, and pickles. I'd eat here regularly if it were closer, and I'd like to come back here and try some other things."}
{"text":"Decent traditional Chinese cuisine. There aren't many Chinese restaurants in Greater Charlotte area (I'd like to use all the area within a 10-mile distance beyond I-485 Circle) that provide better Chinese dishes than here. I'll give it a Top 5. The other 4 may be Lee Cafe in Fort Mills, SC; MyBento Asian Diner on University City Blvd.; and other controversial 2. They both worth a visit. The ultimate highlight I'd like to note here is they provides various kinds of noodle soup. Cheap (generally around $7~8 before tax) and Yum. One order (one bowl) can feed a 150lbs college guy. Have a try if you are Asian/Chinese oriented."}
{"text":"The food is alright at best, very blah. I guess it's there for when you've drank too many beers. Great selection and menu though. Wouldn't be my first choice as a place for dinner, but maybe after dinner drinks. The service was OK, felt a little rushed even when the place wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"Rice was old and that says it all for me, wonton soup was a dark brown instead of a broth color, pan seared dumplings looked like they were sitting in the container making them soggy."}
{"text":"I had dinner there this evening . The food was excellent and very beautiful. My wife had general Tsao's Shrimp  and I had Shrimp Curry which was wonderful.  Bravo 2 the chef"}
{"text":"I won't complain. The service is always impeccable, friendly and leaves nothing to be desired. Food portions are high and aplenty. You won't and shouldn't leave here hungry. A+ to everybody at Panda's Den in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! Quality is superb. Food is delicious. Wonderful service. My new favorite Chinese in the area. Can not get any better!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Truly, I do! I have frequented Pandas Den quite a few times, and each time there is always stellar service, the food is up to par, fresh and excellent! Strangely, I always get my waiter as a young man named Nestor!! He is awesome! So sweet, always attentive to my cuisine needs and just overall a pleasure! A true gem to the restaurant! I love the fact that I am a vegetarian and they have options for me!!! That's fantastic because us non-meat eaters eat Chinese too!! They have tofu with veggies and I promise I've never seen veggies so fresh!!! Absolutely love this place! The owner or manager (not sure which one he is) always asks about my dining experience; they are all so excellent as well as the food! Great choice; Top choice!"}
{"text":"I almost feel sad to write a bad review but this place used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant of all time up until recently. Recently the inside of the restaurant smells bad and the last time I went a roach fell from the ceiling onto my fiancé's plate!!! It was traumatizing and we have not been back since that day (last fall). I used to love this place but it is just not what it used to be. If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, please work on the sanitation so life long customers will return for the food we love so much."}
{"text":"The flavors were good but the quality of the chicken and beef weren't great. Tough to chew and some of the chicken was not chewable and had to be spit out. Even Dad confessed he won't be eating egg fu yung leftovers.  The eggroll was good though."}
{"text":"Pork rice is nice! Friendly services, and fast! Fried chicken (Taiwan style) is a great try, crispy and good authentic Taiwan taste."}
{"text":"Frequently busy due to their great food, but the wait moves fast - as does the time at your table.  If you go at a peak time, know that you aren't going to have a long wait, but you aren't going to have time to sit around and be coddled by the wait staff either.  They're going to get you in and out as quickly as possible, because there are likely other people waiting for your seat.  Even so, the staff is always courteous and helpful, and the food is served up quickly and tasty.  If you order something spicy, make sure that you ask for extra spicy, because they don't go overboard on flavor.  There's plenty of it in the mix, it just isn't designed for someone who wants a large amount of spice in their dish.  Think more along the lines of a Southerner looking for Chinese food.  It's good, but perhaps not really spicy."}
{"text":"Unbelievable quality!  I love this place a truly simple restaurant but don't be fooled, they just forgot to build The Great Wall. Great taste, price and quality matching other High $$ flavors in the city. I live near Lotus II and The Great Wall of China and would chose Pandas Den over both anytime, anyday."}
{"text":"They have really really great and authentic rice wiz stewed pork. The flavor is almost the same in Taiwan! And price is really reasonable with such a big bowl. You should open one in the university campus hh"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   This place was (only because I moved across town) one out my two favorite spots to go to. It seems before you finish placing your order the food is coming out of the kitchen. This was the main reason I was a fan of Pandas Den (PD).   The portions are pretty big. The wings WERE big as well but my last visit...well not so much. They wouldn't dare let you drink be 1sip away from full. On my last visit, the corner booth was Rank!!!  Go enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"Called to ask if open Christmas Day..  less than enthusiastic positive response. we went about noon.  Only a few parties in the restaurant.  We waited 25 minutes when we asked about our order.  Several staffers and (guessing) mgr apologized and food came out shortly after..  great food, served hot and more apologizing..  maybe our ticket got lost.  Quite affordable.. Most likely will go back again.."}
{"text":"I have ordered here for carry out on about two occasions because it is not a long drive from my house.    It always takes about 15 min for the food to be done, which is good.  There is nothing special about the food, just average. The order has always been correct.They are a little pricey than a normal Chinese restaurant, especially just for take out.  I was a little disappointed in that.    The customer service is ok.  They are quick, but also don't really talk much.  Nothing too personable, which could be fine if you want to get in & out!"}
{"text":"I have avoided trying this place for three years now and that has been three years too long.  Panda's Den is actually a charming little Chinese place if you can believe it!  What made me avoid it to begin with was the area it is located in.  That said, I am learning that despite the area being a bit old and rough in places, East Charlotte has lots of little culinary gems if you just give it a chance.  Panda's Den itself is very clean inside and prompt with their service.  The people dining there seemed normal when I was there ( a real plus!) and the wait staff was suited for the venue.  The dining area is simple and hints at welcoming atmosphere.  I would bring my family here if we wanted a quick bite.  The menu is probably like you would expect: lo main, general Tao, etc..  I actually think the food was great! I would put it in the top five Chinese places in Charlotte - that I have been to.     To enjoy this place, I would not go in expecting grandeur and opulence or even an interesting atmosphere.  If you are food minded, you are half way there but don't get hung up thinking that they will cook the same style of Chinese food you loved in college.  Just enjoy it for what it is: a big step up from a decent \"to go\" Chinese place."}
{"text":"After passing this place about a million times, the wife and I decided it was time to check it out. When we arrived, we were seated fairly quickly and had our drink orders taken.   We decided on an appetizer of the crab rangoons, General Tso's chicken and Lo mein noodles for my wife. When we received the rangoons we noticed that they were overcooked. They were very hard and had a burnt taste to them.  My wife's meal the Lo Mein, was watery and flavorless. She did not enjoy them at all and had the waiter take it back. The number one rule of cooking was violated: If YOU wont eat it, don't serve it.   However, the saving grace was the egg fried rice and General Tso's chicken. It was very flavorful and ranks among some of the best I've had. My wife changed her order to sesame chicken. She enjoyed this MUCH more than the Lo Mein. The pieces were tender and juicy.   All in all it was a good visit. Although there were issues with some of the meals, the staff took appropriate action to make the situation right. I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day or maybe my fellow Yelpers just lead me astray, to be honest I'm not really sure which explanation is more likely. As a Charlotte native, I remember coming here a few times growing up, but the food was meh. Based on the Yelp reviews I was sure the ownership had changed and the food was going to be excellent, unfortunately that didn't end up being the case.   Midweek running between appointments and I'm starving decide to try this place because of the high rating and the fact that they have a Taiwanese menu. The vibe of this place is definitely divey. Think well used, but beloved space that was awesome in 1990, but in 2017 just seems worn. Sat down and asked if there was a Chinese menu and they told me the menu they gave me was the only one available. Ok fine I can go for some Americanized Chinese, but not what I was expecting.   Ordered Chicken and vegetables and hot and sour soup - quick, easy, no fuss. The soup came out first and wasn't too bad, not as flavorful as I would have liked, but for $5 and some change I can't really complain. The entree came out second I will say good selection of mixed veggies, but the chicken seemed to have been fried first and the rice/brown sauce was exorbitantly salty. I was chugging water like no-one's business and $5 I should I know what I'm getting myself into in terms of quality.   Mentioned the saltiness to the staff at check out and she stated that they had a new chef in the kitchen who might need to be told to go easy on the salt. Didn't realize until I left, but I guess she charged me less because of the salt issue which was a nice gesture.  Not sure I will be back to be honest. The food just wasn't really good and I value my blood pressure too much to subject myself to that kind of salt intake. However, I will say I love that Panda's Den is still working with local schools as evident by all of the posters at the entrance from various classrooms thanking them for donations/field trips."}
{"text":"This  was my 1st visit  as per a friends  recommendation.  I ordered Orange Chicken and  my friend ordered shrimp fried rice. If i hadny seen the  pieces  of orange peel I would have though2they gave me the  wrong  order."}
{"text":"Quick lunch, good-size portions and fast service ... that's Panda's Den.  One of the best lunch bargains in town. The sesame chicken is first rate, soups are good and the fried noodles at your table are addictive. I like the white rice over the fried rice - if you're making a choice.  Your glass will never be empty. The service is always fast. Maybe too much, but I'll take that over not enough.  Worth a visit at the intersection of Harris and N. Sharon Amity."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the American Chinese food, but from the regulars I see coming through, it has to be pretty decent. I am mainly reviewing their \"authentic Chinese menu.\" At some point they hired a new chef, and they have since then offered snack plates and rice/noodle bowls for good value. The \"soy chicken\" cold dish (vegetarian/vegan chicken - whatever it is called in English) is my favorite! It is tossed in a light sweet and sour sauce. I can just eat that entire plate by myself. Their rice bowls are GIGANTIC! For $8 I had enough food for 3+ meals.  Check this place out if you haven't for real Chinese (more like Taiwanese) dishes."}
{"text":"Charlotte native, have gone here for several years with friends and family. Went there for many Sundays for years. The original owner is no longer there and it seems he took the quality with him. I do know their hot & sour soup is still pretty legit, possibly some other dishes too. But I won't be back. It's sad to see the change.  I do not like giving this place 2 stars but it's just not what it used to be. My recent dinner was chicken and broccoli and sesame chicken. It was gummy and greasy. I ordered brown rice- it wasn't brown rice. A lot of Chinese places do this too. They serve white rice that has some sort of flavorless, brown coating on the rice. Definitely not the same as the true healthy version."}
{"text":"I always order from the authentic Chinese menu. Has some good dishes that's good for single portion or family style. Try ??????????????????????Appetizers wise: ???????????????????"}
