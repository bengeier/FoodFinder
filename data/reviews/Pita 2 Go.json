{"text":"Situé dans l'ancien local d'un Mister Sub, ce Pita 2 Go est pratique pour avoir un sandwich en fin de soirée ou pour avoir un falafel en route pour la maison. Ce n'est pas le meilleur ni le pire, c'est tout simplement pratique !"}
{"text":"After a night cavorting on College street, it is only appropriate to cap it off by throwing your digestive system a curveball in the middle of the night. The bright lights of Pita 2 Go beckoned to us at that ungodly hour, like a siren whispering... \"shawarma.\"  The restaurant is bright and clean though there isn't much room to sit down. (That's what they mean by \"2 Go\".)  At 3am a few things had been cleaned up/shut down, but there were plenty of options available.  The owner \"Mo\" was a super-friendly guy. We got to talking about travel and it was difficult to name a country he hadn't lived in; this cosmopolitan attitude is evident in the menu here. The menu is a generous mix of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean street foods. There are your standard turned meats on a bun, and a few other interesting selections too, like the chicken shawarma poutine ($7.49) and keema (ground beef) on a pita. I ordered the latter for a reasonable $4.69 and it was pretty tasty. The keema has a great spicy flavour, and I think there were peas in it too... awesome. The owner recommended the butter chicken for my next visit and I intend to take him up on it.  I shall return soon!  Obligatory Title Pun: SHWARM yourself up in here.  Menu Readability: Frickin' readable. The menu above the counter is well-lit and easy to read. It would be nice if they had printed brochures too.  Need to mention: Open until 3ish on weeknights and 4ish on weekends.  What this place teaches me about myself: I love peas."}
