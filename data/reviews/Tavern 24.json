{"text":"Shaneese is an awesome server. She was the only server on duty and did a great job considering she had multiple tables. Nachos and wings were delicious and I recommend them. This was our first time here and we are glad we stopped in. 2T4 - take care of your employees. Everyone we came in contact with ensured A+ service."}
{"text":"This establishment is poorly managed. The food is very sub par. The credit card machines go down every 1 to 2 weeks and they take 20 minutes to re boot. The martinis are half full as well. Wait staff is confused and over whelmed. Pretty bad experience."}
{"text":"I was genuinely surprised by the complexity and creativity of the menu at Tavern 24.  They have managed to take bar food ideas and really give them a modern spin.  When you have a restaurant that is able to please my picky parents, (I love them, but they would rather chop an arm off before trying sushi) and my Trendy, Yelping. Millennial self.  I think you're really on to something.  Also the bar is really cool.

I personally can't stand restaurants that have more televisions than people on the inside, but I understand the reasoning behind this choice."}
{"text":"Best steak I ever ate was here at Tavern 24 plus the staff is excellent.  The fire pit is a great spot to eat on a cool night the inside sitting area is nice too.  The place is clean and the service is excellent I recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Kaitlyn was our waitress, and it was clear she could not be bothered with us. My boyfriend had to track down another server to get silver ware, and after she brought us our food, she never came back to check on us or refill our drinks. She walked by our table multiple times and did not even look at us; however, she had plenty of time to talk and flirt with two older gentlemen at a nearby table. The kicker was after she brought us the bill...I had given her my card and was going to sign my final receipt, when I saw that she had charged me the wrong amount! My original bill was for $19 dollars, but she brought me back a receipt with my name on it for $45! My boyfriend took it to her and a manager came by a few minutes later to bring me the corrected receipt. While the manager was nice, she never actually said sorry but just that \"it's such a busy night.\" For the record, it was a Thursday and the restaurant had plenty of open tables. Mistakes can happen to anyone, but the fact that her service prior to this was terrible AND the fact that she never came to our table to personally apologize is just too much. I will not be returning to Tavern 24."}
{"text":"Food is usually good and well prepared, the problem is with the sides. The vegetables were frozen, you could really tell. The fries were way under cooked. This restaurant needs to buy fresh vegetables for their sides, and prepare them as such. The carrots were baby carrots out of the bag. Frozen I'm sure, as well as the broccoli. Service has always been great for us."}
{"text":"Here for the second time. Food was less appetizing than the last as well. Wish the friendly manager was here like last time, his integrity to this place made the experience worth while despite the obvious reluctance given to myself by my waitress."}
{"text":"Just no!  Service is absolutely miserable. Spent 2+ hours there. Took about 25 mins after I ordered beer to actually have one at the table. Rude servers food is okay. Just a typical chain with no soul. :("}
{"text":"I took my wife here to celebrate her birthday. While the place was busy, we were seated promptly. We ordered our food, but it seemed to take a long time for our food to come out. 3 burgers and fries (one sweet potato fries). The burgers were only warm, and looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time. The two orders of pub fries were soggy and greasy. It looked like the cooking oil was not the correct temp.  The sweet potato fries were cool. 

On a positive note, the deserts were good (we had the chocolate cake and key lime pie) and the place looked nice, but given all of choices in Gastonia, many with much better food, this place is off our list."}
{"text":"This place used to be fantastic.  Always packed, but great food and fantastic prices.  Well, it's not fantastic anymore.  It's not even mediocre.  The last four times I've been, the service and food has just gotten worse and worse which is sad because I always looked forward to going.  The service is slow and sloppy despite the fact that there are no more than four tables in the restaurant.  My last trip resulted in getting the wrong food the first time, undercooked food the second time, and a third try which I didn't even bother trying."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and service. The food was great. Only complaint is that the hot wings are not very spicy. They were tasty but I ordered \"the hottest wings they have\" and they were very mild."}
{"text":"We had the Prime Rib, was great, wonderful, cooked just as we ordered. The little potato croquet  was outstanding. Our waitress was great as well. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Staff is great and the beer is cold. Prime rib is great. I will be back"}
{"text":"Now that this is a karioki  bar and not a sports bar.  It's too loud to enjoy.  I've walked our twice and won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for a belated mother's day celebration at noon on Wednesday.  We were seated promptly and the air conditioning was working just fine.  I ordered the Club Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries and my mom ordered the French Onion Soup and Salad combo.  After a moderate wait for the food to arrive, my sandwich was on the dry side.  The cheese tasted fine, but had a dried out texture.  The ham and turkey were also a little on the dry side and there was no bacon to be found on the sandwich.  The sweet potato fries were very good.  My mom enjoyed the salad but commented that the french onion soup was very, very salty.  I like this place and will definitely give it another chance.  I will not order the club sandwich on my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday after being in the area for a work meeting. I had a salad with a burger on top which satisfied my hunger perfectly. The service was great and attentive. Located in the parking lot of the Target and right off of I-85, Tavern 24 is a great stop if you find yourself visiting or passing through Gastonia."}
{"text":"This place was great. I took my mother here for Thanksgiving and they served a traditional turkey meal for her and i got some chicken since i don't like turkey. The food was well presented and nicely portioned. the waiter was very attentive and made sure we had everything. I thought it was also pretty cheap for what we got. I'll defiantly be a repeat eater here."}
{"text":"Great food good prices, just don't go on Sunday cocksucker steelers fan there. It's enough to make you throw up what you ate.
Name is Doyle I think older guy missing teeth and hair. Other than his pony tail."}
{"text":"Today was my first trip there. Service was good and food came out quickly. The sweet potato fries were a little salty but the Cuban sandwich and BTYMC Chocolate Cake were outstanding. I will definitely go back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Good food and good price. Waitress was pushy. The atmosphere is nice. The big booths are good and seem private which is good."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriend for a late lunch early dinner.  Sat outside on their great oatuo.  My gf had a burger and sweet potato fries that she devoured.  I had the meat pizza.  I was very impressed that their caramelized onions actually were brown, caramelized perfectly.  Most places caramelized onions are barely cooked and disappointing.    Our waitress Nancy was really awesome!  Overall it was a great visit."}
{"text":"Best baby back ribs ever, best cheese fries ever. They also have amazing burgers, wings and sandwiches. Don't get the pizza though, that's about the only flop they have, I really hope they improve on the pizza it's making them look bad to people who have only tried the pizza. The atmosphere is really nice, The servers are amazing and super friendly. Me and my husband go there every week."}
{"text":"The food is amazing - SHRIMP & GRITS are the best I've ever had!!!  The service is top notch, the food comes out super fast and the servers are always on point. I highly recommend them you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time eating at Tavern 24 and now I understand why NO-ONE has ever recommended this restaurant!  When you walk in the door you are greeted by friendly hostess but the smell of soured dirty dish cloths is almost overwhelming!   We were seated and waited over 10 minutes before the server came to our table.  If they had been busy would have understood the wait. We were in the Tavern around 12:30 and very few were in the place !  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The burger was not hot and the soggy lettuce was on the bottom.  The onion straws were greasy and limp.  The server was nice but definitely was not trained nor did he know the menu.   Will not return. The price of the meal and service were not to be desired."}
{"text":"Never again!   We had a large group of 15 people and so called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us. They told us no problem and could sit us inside where it was heated. When we arrived they said they had no room for us.  Both the hostess and the manager were rude and when we complained, they threatened to call the police on us.  Freaking unbelievable.   I can't wait until they go out if business."}
{"text":"Tried this because supplied a lot of the material for this restaurant. Should have been happy with that but what a disappointment. First the waiter came 20 minutes after we were seated. Took our order because we were ready no reason to just order beverages. Brought the wrong drinks and had to wait until food arrived to inform him. He set our burgers down but we had no fries. So off he goes to get our drinks fixed and the fries. Guess he went to cook the fries so we sat there 25 minutes waiting on a drink or fries. So we ate the burgers with no fries or drinks. So here he comes with the fries and drinks 10 minutes too late."}
{"text":"I give three out of five stars solely because the fries portions are quite sad. I was with a table of 9, most of which got fries, and the serving size was embarrassing. A little more fries would have given this place a 4/5. The atmosphere was nice, the server was attentive and the manager was visible."}
{"text":"Updated:  I am adding a star to the previous 2 I had given them because I value Customer Service as highly as I do Product Quality.  The manager did reach out to me and offer me a second chance at their menu with a complimentary dinner.  

Although I did not take him up on his offer, the gesture was appreciated and warrants  a revision to the rating."}
{"text":"LO RECOMIENDO 100%
Las atenciones son muy buenas y la comida riquísima."}
{"text":"Best food around. I had chicken wings and tater wedges and a half rack of ribs. Best tasting food ever. The ribs fell off the bone."}
{"text":"We found Tavern 24 by accident and decided to give it a try.  Hard to find, but the service and food made up for it!!!   Jessica was excellent and extremely helpful as we were new to the restaurant.  She also had the manager come by and see us. He was very friendly.  The food was excellent!   We are definitely going back when we are in the area!!"}
{"text":"We usually love this type of joint, but this one was sub par. For a Saturday night, it was not packed (not a good sign) and I think the service overall was the reason. Our waiter was nice - he was definitely attempting to do a good job - but was very slow. 2 of our 4 orders arrived incorrectly. We also were delivered drinks that weren't ours. However, we did have four people with an appetizer to share, 2 alcoholic drinks a piece, 4 entrees, and one dessert, and our total before tip was fairly reasonable at $74.

I got the Bayou Top Sirloin. The steak wasn't cooked medium like I requested - it was dry and definitely well done. It was a tiny piece and the sauce tasted like it was from a can, which I think it probably was. The shrimp on top were tiny shrimp cut in half - it was almost a joke. However, the taste wasn't terrible, and since the price wasn't outrageous I guess I couldn't expect too much for a steak/shrimp.

We got the cheese fries as an appetizer and they were good. Scallions, bacon, cheese, and their semi-thick fries... it was a good size plate to split with 4 adults."}
{"text":"When here with my dad and some friends order some drinks my dad and friends are older the 50 and still got carded. They wouldn't serve drinks untell they seen the id really u can tell they are old enough. Ordered stacks they was way under cooked  and the sweet tea was old. I dont think we will be back"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to go to an awesome sports bar? Have you ever wanted to watch football, socialize with people in a fun atmosphere while eating deliciously sinful food? If so, bypass this place! I don't always cheat on my diet so when I do I want something that makes it worth it. 

However, if you want a mediocre place with a sketchy crowd and pizza so watered down that your toppings legitimately fall off the nasty crust.. You're in luck!! This is your place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night. Promptly waited upon.  One in our party had been before and recommended the chicken tenders aka calabash chicken. With that recommendation, I ordered the calabash chicken salad (chicken tenders on top of mixed salad). Although there was too much bacon on it for me, it was very good. Others in my party ordered a pizza, black bean burger, loaded baked potato and side salad. Everyone said their meals were good. 
Lots of tvs to watch whatever sport you want. Quick service. I will be back next time I'm in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Very good food
 Service needs to follow suit. Maybe next time they will not have rude people working..."}
{"text":"I love Tavern 24! The food and Wait staff are wonderful! I really like the sauce on the wings I got. They have a really nice patio area with a fire pit. I'm really impressed and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"slightly better than the average food choice in the area.  had a tasty healthy salad requesting dressing on the side.  my husband opted for the fried portion of the menu and enjoyed it.  you could definitely do worse in gastonia."}
{"text":"We went to hear a friend who played in the band. It was very crowded. Service was slow, but the place was packed. I really liked the Tavern 24 beer. Very good, in a 22oz mug and only $3.75. My wife loved the Saranak S'mores beer. We got the nachos. Very good and only $10. Included  chicken and beef. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been awhile since we are here and don't know why, food is great, service attentive and good prices.  Great place to watch games, eat nachos with tri colored chips, topped with guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapeños and tiny black beans.  Get chicken added and perfect for sharing.  Lots of options, calabash chicken tenders are always moist, everything going past our table looks amazing."}
{"text":"This place for me is Meh, I've had better but it was good for what I needed it for. Nothing BLOW ME AWAY worthy. 

I had a business meeting in the area and after the meeting everyone decided to go have lunch. Not being from the area I went with their suggestion and prior to agreeing I check Yelp which didn't put this place in the highest regard BUT I like to give places a try on my own for what it's worth just as long as they don't have ONE star on Yelp LoL and the reviews don't say anything about sanitation.

Our server was nice and sorta odd as he handed out napkins for our table of 6 by throwing them across the table to each person as oppose to walking around the table to sit them in front of each person. I'll leave that right there now let's get to the food. I ordered the vegetarian salad which was OK. It looked incredible but some of the ingredients were not so fresh such as the lemons ( seemed like the bar lemon garnish for drinks and appeared as random items to throw on the salad to make it look nice but I personally can live without those bat germs from the skins of fruit that is not cleaned properly from the skin all around) and the grapefruit seemed mushy.

One of the guys in my group ordered naked wings and they didn't come out until 5 of us had our food and was almost half done as the server said they were running behind. Now let me say, this place was NOT busy as I think it had the potential to be considering the location and the look and feel. 

We sat on the patio and the heaters were extremely HOT which was good because regardless of the fact that the sun was shining and it was warm in the sun, under the deck was pretty nippy so I commend them for the heaters on the patio ceiling.

Not sure if I'd eat here again while in the area for business but that is not definitive as I like to give places multiple chances (2-3)."}
{"text":"I went on Monday and the burgers were $5.  I got the stuffed beer burger and as advertised it was really tasty. Wife got salad topped with salmon and went back later in the week for the same. Next Monday I know where I'm going."}
{"text":"We had an overall pleasant experience at Tavern 24 today. We decided to give it a try on our way through to the airport. It is conveniently located right off the highway. The space is very nice. Cool, modern look. Lots of tvs. I'm sure it is awesome to watch sporting events at.

Our server was great. Very friendly and kind. We ordered the spinach artichoke for an appetizer and it was satisfactory. Topped with pico de gallo which added a fresh twist. The chips were seasoned nicely. 

The main reason I give Tavern 24 only two stars is solely due to the fact that both our burgers were overcooked. I can't understand how a restaurant can be known for their burgers when they can't even temp one correctly. I ordered a medium rare blackened blue burger. It came out well done. Super disappointed. We were in a hurry or else I would have sent it back. My father ordered his burger medium and it also came out well done. 

We made the issue clear to the server and she apparently talked to the chef and her manager. I would normally expect them to discount the bill or give us a free dessert but the issue wasn't brought up again. It's too bad. Otherwise I would have given Tavern a good rating. Oh well :("}
{"text":"Mark was my server. He was SUPER nice and made me feel welcome. I was dining alone so it was good to be taking care of so well."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise. Some would love the tv's turned to sports. I was mot crazy about that but i loved the food. I had a lunch special of ribs with a spivy whisky sauce and a salad served in a chilled salad bowl. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill over the past year! Was one of our favorite dinner spots until the last two times we've been. 6 gummy all wingette, wings for $9 is robbery! On both occasions the hostess was distracted by flirting male coworkers and we didn't receive silverware or napkins. 
Not sure if management has changed recently, but if not maybe it needs to! Save your money and try hickory tavern instead."}
{"text":"I went with my mom this past Monday.  The hostess wasn't excited to see us and she didn't even say a word to us. My mom had to tell her \"2\" completely unsolicited. She nodded and sat us in the corner of the dining area. We wanted to scope out the bar so this was a disappointment but I guess we weren't worthy enough to sit in the bar area. The waitress was at the table right by us with her coworkers eating. Yes, we were seated by the employees lunch break table. 

Moving on!

So we ordered a beer and fancy $3 cocktail. The bartender over poured.  I shudder remembering the power of the vodka in such a small glass. Lol But hey, whatever, let's eat, right?  We ordered an appetizer which was delicious and got the heck out of there in search of a friendlier place with a better atmosphere.

Sorry Tavern 24, foods great but your staff and atmosphere are terrible."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night. First thing my wife noticed is that there is no sidewalk around the place. Have to keep on your toes or get run over. Had a 2 min. wait. 5 people at the front desk. Could not readily understand what they were saying as they all wanted to talk at once. Very confusing.
 Small booth with table for 2. Table wobbles. TVs everywhere. Floor sticky and overall appearance, \"cheap\" looking. 
 Waitress prompt, tea very good but in plastic glass. Beer comes in glass  glass. ? Waitress was good and never let needs go unfulfilled. My wife got the calabash chicken salad. She was disappointed with amount of chicken but indicated salad was good. I had the patty melt. Rye bread was much larger than actual burger so almost half of the bread was not eaten. Hamburger was greasy and saturated the bread with grease.  Fries were very hot but a little greasy.
 For a relatively new restaurant I expected a little more. The ambiance was of a cheap sports bar not a family restaurant. Really good wait staff, but not good enough to entice me to come back. Food and atmosphere will keep me away."}
{"text":"Not that I don't love Gastonia I am here just about three times a week.  The thing is it's full of fast food and chain restaurants so for lunch options you guessed it usually fast food.  What a nice find when my coworker and I came across Tavern 24.  The place had just opened and I was a little skeptical I hate visiting a restaurant when it is so new I never feel like I get the right experience.  But this place did it right they were fully staffed and ready to serve.  The grilled chicken sandwich that I ordered was delicious as well as their sweet potato fries, my coworker ordered a pizza that he said was awesome.  Overall a great lunch experience if your in Gastonia I would definitely give this place a try.   On a side note when we get warmer weather check out the patio they have an awesome patio!"}
{"text":"All in all this place is pretty good!  The wings are huge and very tasty. The stuffed beer burger is also excellent.  Honestly that burger is by far one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life.  My only negative is that they are not to good on cooking the burgers.  The two  times I carried my burger out it was still very pink in the center when I asked for well done. However, I pop it in the microwave and its still great!  Definitely try the beer burger. especially if you like stout beer!"}
{"text":"Greasy food. Greasy hamburger and greasy prime rib sandwich. Prime rib was similar to microwave steakum"}
{"text":"Terrible lunch time service. Waitress didn't check on us one time during our meal and the place was almost empty. Dry burger and mediocre fries. 24 is my favorite number... what a shame."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place twice now on my way home from the airport, my first visit was okay but my second visit was sub-par at best.

They have good wings, a decent beer selection (make sure to get the Appalachian Mountain Brewery Long Leaf IPA) and a large enough menu, but we are yet to get good service. 

Nothing I've tried here is spectacular, like I said before I enjoy the wings but their burgers aren't great and I was not impressed with their salads. 

I would probably come back, but I would not make a special trip for it. 3 stars all day"}
{"text":"For traditional bar food, you don't get much better than this!  I took my daughter here for a mini celebration today and we had a great lunch!  I had the citrus salad with salmon and the citrus vinaigrette; it was beautifully plated and so yummy I could eat it at LEAST once a week!  My daughter had the steak and she's a complete steak snob, but she loved their steak.  It was perfectly done and the knife slid through it like butter!  The chicken tender appetizer was good as well.  I'd tell you more about it but my daughter had the lion share of the chicken so I don't have a lot of experience there!

Jamie, our server, was attentive and made the experience that much better.  If the other servers are as good as he was you'll never want for ANYTHING.  So, in short, I can't come up with any complaints for Tavern 24.  It's just good food at decent prices.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area so we've been trying out restaurants around town. However, we will not be trying this place again. First off, we waited a while for our drinks and order to be placed. We are pretty easy going so this didn't bother us too much. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits which didn't even look very tasty when it arrived at our table. At the same time, she brought me the wrong sandwich so we had to wait on that to be fixed. It took some time and all the while my husband's food was getting cold. The correct sandwich finally comes out and I almost wish they had just kept it. Both meals were super underwhelming. How do you mess up a sandwich?! Just trying to keep other people from making the same mistake we did."}
{"text":"My loser workmate wanted to go to McAllisters Deli for lunch. I was like WTF? There are 40 restaurants in the area and you choose some chain deli? I was not having it. So I suggested Tavern 24 just across the parking lot. I am glad we did.

I got the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. It was more of a New Orleans style than Carolina. The spicy sausage and brown gravy were different than the typical Carolina style. I am pretty sure the shrimp were frozen, and they were small, but still tasted pretty good. I added a touch of hot sauce to set this one off. Very well done dish."}
{"text":"Nikki at the bar is top notch. Excellent service. Good draft selection and late night specials. Plenty of TVs to catch whatever sport you want to watch. Food is ok, but a GREAT addition to this area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was good! Nice outdoor firepit. And the hostess and most of the waitresses are pretty yummy too. Yes, I did just say that!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and cheerful. We were a large group and our waitress handled everyone with grace. The food was great. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food on the other hand, awful. We ordered cheese fries as an app, fries were cold, old, overly greasy as in refried greasy, cheese wasn't melted and cold. Also ordered pretzel sticks, burned on the bottom from where they were recooked, stale. Got the 24/7 burger, it was good, my side of fries, old tasting, cold, overly greasy as though they had also been refried. Definitely won't be back. Disappointed, to say the least. Our sodas were good."}
{"text":"Great local bar , clean updated atmosphere. 
Friendly staff, large beer selection. Everyone pretty much was drinking beer and fireball shots. 
Food looked good but didn't have to comment on. Happy Hour, save $1 on beer pints, ranges 2.75 to 3.50 on beers I ordered. 
Highly recommend to stop by."}
{"text":"I've been by the place on the way to Target many times and never considered going there.  Looks like a typical sports bar with average bar food.  On a suggestion from a neighbor, my wife and I decided to try it out.  When walking in, it looks like a chic modern sports bar.  Lots of TVs, but also lots of comfortable seating.  Light interior (compared to other dark sports bars). I'm not a big sports nut, so I don't care about all the TVs.

The food from this place is excellent!  We have been back many times.  I have ordered different things and my wife sticks with one thing.  We have never gotten a bad meal- the food has always been outstanding.  We usually start out with the pretzel, which is to die for. 2 dipping sauces are included and you can never decide which is best.  My wife gets a salmon salad and I have gotten different burgers and some chicken meals.  I keep trying different things trying to see if everything tastes great. So far it has. The beer is awesome too!

Reasonably priced. Staff is friendly and quick.

This is our new favorite restaurant in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good food. We stopped by while traveling and really enjoyed our lunch. We had wings and a salad and both impressed. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the atmosphere, staff, overall demeanor has changed and definitely not for the good.  Bartender is less than personable and barely concerned with the ones she's serving.  Food came out literally falling off the plate.  Bar tender putting up her hair at the bar, then making people's drinks and bringing out food plates without washing her hands.  Needless to say, there's obviously been a manager change and I won't be back.  Guess others have got the word since there's barely anyone here. Sad bc it used to be a fun place."}
{"text":"I love this place and the food is consistently good. The one area this place can improve is with the service at the bar. Apparently it is common to order a draft beer and not get what you ordered if you are eating in the bar area. This has happened to me twice - both times I have been here. 
The last time this happened I had ordered a Sweetwater IPA draft and was served a Blue Moon. I brought this to the waitresses attention and she explained the bartender often makes glaring mistakes like this and often blows it off by saying \"the customer will never know the difference..\" 
Seriously? 
I can only give 3 stars based on this experience."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and I am glad we did.    We went on Sunday at 4:30 and no wait but by the time we left there was quite a wait.  
Menu had a good selection of pub food and drinks.  We got the trio appetizer to start, everything was good (loved the calabash chicken).  I got the cream cheese grits with shrimp with Italian sausage.  I like cream cheese but it was too much in this dish and over powered it.  Everyone else got burgers which were messy and the club on ciabatta that looked good.

Our server Amanda was great and on her toes even thought was her twenty first birthday the day before.  I will definitely ask to be seated in her station again. :)"}
{"text":"Very mediocre bar and grill type restaurant I had a burger and there was nothing spectacular about it."}
{"text":"Best place in my opinion to catch a game, it seems like you have your own personal television. Love the outside patio as well"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was great. Philly made with \"ribeye\" was really dry, and they didn't add the mayo that I asked for. House made chips were very chewy. Blackened chicken was so dry, couldn't finish it. Pizza and chicken fingers were tasty."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the Philly cheesesteak special on hoagie roll. I was surprised to see a minuscule amount of cheese and not an overwhelming portion of prime rib. I mentioned this to our server who was very accommodating. He had the mgr come over. I explained my observation to the  mgr. he said that the cheesesteak was a first time offering and appreciated the input and concluded that they should use 2 pieces of cheese. The sandwich tasted fine. When the check came l was surprised to see my sandwich comped. A truly nice and professional gesture."}
{"text":"Tavern 24 had it all. Huge beer selection great appetizers and entries. Friendly and helpful staff! Wish we had this Tavern in California"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Tavern 24 in the past, the last time a few months ago, and found it to be an average place for lunch with average food and average service.  However, this past week, I went to Tavern 24 and encountered the most unprofessional restaurant staff I have probably ever witnessed.  In fairness, I paid my way through college working in fine dining restaurants, so maybe my expectations exceed what these people are reasonably capable of.  On the other hand, my favorite restaurant is in the end of a gas station on the edge of a swamp on Edisto Island, South Carolina.  A restaurant which, by the way, exceeds Tavern 24 in every respect.

The cluelessness began as soon as I arrived.  I had a child with me and the hostess seated us right next to the crowded bar even though there were plenty of tables available throughout the restaurant.  I had her move us to a more reasonable table.  Next, our waiter arrived sniffling, wearing a heavy coat and complaining to me that he was freezing, even though the restaurant was uncomfortably warm.  I'm pretty sure he was sick.  The table had not been thoroughly wiped down and the condiment bottles were sticky.

As I began to look around, I noticed nearly all the slow-moving waitstaff were covered in visible tattoos and a couple of the women with multiple face piercings.  I don't care if someone is a tattoo enthusiast, they look ridiculously unprofessional and the piercings look, at best, unsanitary.  There are few things more unappetizing than feeling as though you have walked into a Hepatitis-C convention.  It is alarming that people with no better judgment than this are handling food.

I called for the manager and, as I expected, found the root of the problem.  I told him my concerns and he explained, in no uncertain terms, that this is how he runs a restaurant: sections get seated in turn, regardless of the apparent comfort or needs of the customers; he hires people without worrying about the impression they make on the dining public and he is far more concerned with the bar than the food service anyway.  The manager also indicated that if I wanted to go to an actual restaurant, I should go to Fatz, which is owned by the same company.

Bad employees are the result of bad management.  I can't go back and trust these people to handle my food."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night and they were crowded. I about a 20 min wait and I believe it was worth the wait. I checked the menu out and for some reason I thought pizzia sounded good. I had the Meat Pizzia and I have to say it was one of the better pizzia I have had in awhile. The wait server was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place. I would go back again next time I am in Gastonia."}
{"text":"The following review may seem off topic at first but please read the whole thing as I had a very bad experience here.

I went here with my girlfriend to meet someone for a craigslist deal.  It's important to note the other party (the seller) wanted to meet there.  We arrived before they did and the seller informed me that Christina at the bar would hook us up with free drinks if we said we know him.  

RED FLAG. 

No bartender, anywhere, should give out free drinks.  This is stealing and irresponsible for the community and I won't accept free drinks at a bar.  If an owner is stupid enough to give free drinks to \"friends\" he also isn't smart enough to realize his \"friends\" are using him.  If you can't afford alcohol you have more pressing problems.

The seller turned out to be trying to commit fraud and sell us a broken potentially stolen product.  After I told him I wouldn't fall for it he began yelling and swearing at me and my girlfriend in front of the whole bar.  This doesn't reflect poorly on Tavern 24 but what followed does.

When we tried to stand up for ourselves bartender Christina told us \"this is a family restaurant don't talk to him like that\" as the seller continued to cuss at my girlfriend and I. This person was intent on fighting us and the staff of Tavern 24 SUPPORTED THE AGGRESSOR.  Luckily I'm a responsible adult and there happened to be a police officer present. I paid my tab and left.

Also the fries were just okay and I think their Tavern 24 draft is just Bud Light with a slightly higher price."}
{"text":"Called ahead Saturday night to verify no wait.  Hostess informed us two minutes later when we arrived there would be a 15 minute wait.  There were several open tables visible.  The place was not busy.  Hostess was rude and server was terrible.  No silverware or napkins with our food.  She was less than thrilled when we asked her for them after she forgot to ring in our appetizer.  Food was mediocre at best.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Tried Tavern after a long break.  Our server, Rex was awesome. He was very attentive.  We had the nachos with beef as an app and it was large and tasty.  Served very quickly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The customer service on this visit was great! The waitress Courtney was very friendly and nice. The GM was also nice and courteous. However my steak was supposed to be medium well. It came out burnt and bleeding. They took it back to and cooked it more. So now it was really burnt. After telling the waitress it was corrected and the GM brought me a new one cooked to perfection! As a plus they had live music that was really good!"}
{"text":"I visited Tavern 24 on December 3rd.  It is a very nice establishment.  My wife and I were especially thrilled to see the nice outdoor area that has amazingly good heaters for the cooler and even down right cold evenings.  She smokes, so sitting outside is always a good thing.  Until now..  More on that in a minute.

When we arrived we asked to be seated in the patio area.  We were taken to our table and sat down.  The over-head fans were on. Now granted, December 3rd, 2012 in Gastonia was a warmer than usual day with temps in the low 60's.  But when we were sat, the temp was about 57.  With the fans blowing it was just cold.  We asked if they could be turned off.  The waitress was very pleasant and immediately turned them off.  Without the fans, it was perfect (in our opinion). However, someone at another table must have complained that they were too hot, because in just a few minutes, the fans came back on. We asked about it when the waitress came by.  She stated someone else had complained it was too hot, so they turned the fans back on.  Also interesting to note, there are a lot of fans and they are all connected.  So it's all or nothing. Then, to our surprise, the heaters came on.  Also something to note, the heaters are on or off, there is no adjustment.  They radiate enough heat to keep your food nice and hot, but that means you are too. It honestly became comical at the fan on, heaters off, heaters on fans on, fans off heaters on dance that continued the whole time we were there. 

Now the wait staff.  It's a newly opened restaurant, but I think they went out of their way to get people who've never worked a restaurant before.  They were sorely disorganized.  We never got silverware until after the food arrived, and they tried to deliver our food to the wrong table.  When we explained it, they left our food at the wrong table while they went to check.  We did have the opportunity to meet some nice folks that complimented us on our selections.  The waitress returned, having confirmed her error, and gave us our food from the other table.  Our drinks were never refilled.  Now, about that smoking.  There is no smoking outside. They gave us some excuse about needing fire marshal approval, but had no ashtrays on hand. So really, did they expect to allow smoking outside but just didn't bother with ashtrays until the fire marshal said it was ok? I doubt it.  They just didn't want to say there would be no smoking outside because they knew it was just absurd. We got our to-go boxes and left.  BTW, I had the \"El Diablo Pizza\".  It was excellent! My wife ordered the Grilled Quesadilla appetizer as her meal.  It too was excellent.

I know I've spent most of my time bitching about them, but I'm willing to let the disorganization go to it being a new restaurant.  But the smoking ban outside is ridiculous. So if you're a smoker, keep in mind, you won't be able to smoke here unless you go to the area outside of the heated zone.  If you're a non-smoker, then I think you'll enjoy this place quite a bit.  

FOLLOW UP (01/11/2013): Tom, the general manager of Tavern 24, contacted me to let me know that the smoking area is the area by the firepit table.  That's just two tables that will seat 2, maybe 3 people, as it's pushed up to a wall on one side and the firepit table that will seat 8-10 people.  I'd estimate the outdoor seating at approximately 70-80, smoking section 16.  That's about 20% of the outdoor seating given to the smokers."}
{"text":"Food is great for a sports bar.  Beer selection is a little pedestrian.  I'd recommend the Shrimp and grits when they have it."}
{"text":"I have ate here quit a few times and always enjoyed my food but The last time I went I wasn't that hungry I just really wanted a few drinks so I ordered something small and choose the wings ... I couldn't believe the wings here!  I wasn't expecting the wings to be SOOO GOOD! Reminded me off buffalo NY wings and that is hard to find! The wings were so Crispy cooked to perfection and loaded with bbq sauce I will order them every time I come. not kidding!"}
{"text":"Meh. I wanted it to be better. The food was decent enough - they had some good ideas on the menu but not sure the follow through was there. Its like they want to be a fancier burger type place and I'm just not sure they're pulling it off. I'd rather the food be really good and simple than just alright and inventive. A passable beer selection and ambiance. I hope it gets better, Gastonia needs it!"}
{"text":"Went with my a friend. We sat for 30 minutes waiting on service and debated leaving. Finally they took our order and the food was ridiculously over priced. Most importantly the bottled beer. None the less I saw our serve maybe 3 times who seemed to be on some sort of upper the way he was moving. Overall, drinks are ridiculously overpriced and food is average. Would not reccomend."}
{"text":"We have been to Tavern 24 and the food and service is always good!  We had a group of 10 this time.  The hostess asked if we minded high tops, that was  fine, except that she put together five round tables, not the best for conversation, so I asked if we could sit at rectangle tables and she said these are the only tables available, even though most of the inside seating was empty!! Just felt we could have been accommodated better!  Also thought it was odd when the waiter said he could not put in all orders at the same time???  What???  So some of us got our food and others had to wait??  We really like the food but not sure if and when we will go back, maybe time to find a new place!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch. The prices were very reasonable. Presentation was excellent. The shrimp and grits were probably not traditional, but they were fantastic. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger here. It was aight. Seems like its a generic sports bar kind of place. Kind of like a poor mans taco mac. Not bad but really not great. Best part was the people watching. Lots of interesting couples."}
{"text":"Not the best experience today. Asked to be seated at a high top by the bar. \"No problem\" said the hostess. But apparently it was, because we sat there for 6 minutes with no attention whatsoever. There were at least 12 employees that I counted milling around, passing by our table. Some managers, some waitstaff. Here's the kicker - the restaurant was not crowded or busy. Inexcusable. Frustrated and irked we took our menus to the bar. The bartender was friendly enough and attentive, but it was too little too late. Kudos for having OMB Dunkel and Sam Adams Rebel on tap. The cheese fries were 4 stars. This is your free pass Tavern 24. Good beer and food aside, the service is your weakness."}
{"text":"Potato cakes are AWESOME!!!!!  Always goes well with my custom burger.  I could eat the potato cakes by themselves every day though."}
{"text":"This sports bar has focused on the quality of food that they serve and it really separates them from the pack. Their burgers are angus beef and are made fresh each order.  They will cook exactly as requested and serve on a buttered, toasted bun. Super reasonable prices and lots of delicious choices. Oh and did I mention 24 beers on tap?  What's not to like!"}
{"text":"Just tried to go there and they stopped me at the door to tell me \"due to violations we wont be selling alcohol this weekend\""}
{"text":"The worst place ever!!!
I went in there yesterday and waited at the bar for 5-7 minutes (no joke) with out ever being greeted. So I decided to leave. Upon doing so I decided to call the and speak to the manager and let them know why I was leaving and perhaps give them an opportunity to resolve the issue, if not for me maybe for future business. Anyway, some kid puts me on hold for another 4 minutes before I hung up and chalk it up to bad management and from poor leadership comes poor service. So I jump on my bike and head down to Hooters where the service was friendly and inviting. However, I still felt that the management should know about all the mishaps thus far. So I call back there and a lady answers the phone and I ask her what the GM's name is and she informs me that they DON'T HAVE A GM!!! Well now it is all starting to make since. My suggestion, NEVER GO THERE! I know I won't be. Well, hopefully it closes down and somebody who knows how to run a restaurant gets in that spot. My suggestion, go across the parking lot to Lone Star. At least they're inviting and want your business."}
{"text":"Came for some food with the family.  We were promptly greeted at the door and sat down outside under the awning.  It is nice! Especially since there was a downpour earlier on.  If it rains, come here.  There is a fire pit outside so night time without rain should be good.  They had \"RJ son of a peach\" on the chalk board and that is exactly what I ordered, so good suggestion at entrance."}
{"text":"I read previous reviews that said the servers were rude, unprofessional and tattooed. I saw none of this. The hostess and our server were professional, attentive and smiling constantly. Both of us ordered the wings which were excellent. Meaty, saucy and flavorful. My friend also ordered a side salad for $2.99 and it was huge. She had to take half home. The restaurant was average in terms of cleanliness - our table wasn't sticky, I saw no trash or bugs. The only reason why I'm only giving 3 stars is that I think a place with a full bar and \"Tavern\" in the name should make awesome alcoholic drinks. I could barely taste the rum in my drink. I told my server and she happily took it back to the bar to fix it. However, it returned still watered down. My friend had eaten there before and mentioned that her previous drinks were weak too. I had a long week at work and was looking forward to a nice drink to start my weekend. I did not receive it. I would return, however, because the food was good and we peeked at other people's food and they looked great. However, I'll have to give specific instructions to the bartender on how to make an adult drink."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for several weeks in a row over the summer because we got hooked on the .50 boneless wings. Soooo good. Then we went back a few weeks ago after a hiatus and were told they only offer the wings on \"game nights\". The waitress said they didn't offer the boneless wings at all, we were willing to pay full price rather than 50 cent.

The few times we came over the summer it was absolutely packed. Servers were busy and had a lot of tables so we were patient when we had to wait forever to get our order taken. (Plus , .50 wings! Doesn't get any better.) 

I agree with some of the other reviews though, this place has sort of went down hill. Some of the last few servers I had seemed pretty rude and service was slow even though the restaurant was not busy. My advice would be to hire friendlier staff and to bring back the fifty cent  boneless wings."}
{"text":"Good service. Cardboard bar food. Now I'm writing more to satisfy writing quota for the app. But really - the first two sentences fully satisfy all I have in my heart to say regarding this dining establishment."}
{"text":"The service was great! Greeted immediately and she was very friendly. Ordered from there lunch menu. Which wasn't badly priced. $7 for a meal. With pasta it's an up charge for a side. But I didn't want one so it was not an issue. I got a White zombie (one of my favorite drinks) on tap, so was really happy about that. Good food,perfect amount for a lunch portion.  Definitely recommend this place. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"enjoy the drinks and awesome chicken sandwich very flavorful. they could have some better wing special $1 per wing doesn't sound like a deal. the waiter was very nice. will come back again"}
{"text":"I went here awhile ago, I'm back dating my reviews b/c I was a slack yelper! 

Anyways, I've been here a few times, and each time ordered a drink, and appetizer. Each time, drinks been on point, and app has come out fast. The place is always clean, and if you like to be under the stars there is a pretty dope outside area you can chill & enjoy the company you are with.

The ONLY reason for 4 stars is due to the fact that I'm not sure if the staff pays attention to how drunk some of the customers get. Each time I've been there I've seen at least one person beyond wasted, and still drinking. In all fairness to the staff once I saw a female bartender say no, and catch someone trying to buy drinks for the obnoxiously drunk person. For the safety of others, and the reputation of the establishment I think that they should be more vigilant in keeping this under wraps. 

Other than that this place is great for lunch, dinner, and after hours."}
{"text":"Meh... nothing amazing. Don't be in a hurry. There seem to be a lot of employees, but no one is really in a hurry to do anything. There also seems to be many frustrated customers. The food is as expected of chain restaurant bar food. I'm not from the area, so if I am back here I'll probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My group had prompt service from personable waitstaff, and delicious food.  If you want to watch TV while you eat, this is the place.  There are an incredible number of screens, facing every which way, but mounted high enough that you don't HAVE to look at them if you're not interested - and the sound is not intrusive ( you can tell I wasn't there for Sports TV, right? haha)"}
{"text":"Second time here, so I feel like a review is warranted. My date and I both got the sirloin, she got it plain mine with Alfredo and shrimp toping. They may have been (key word may) 5oz portions tops. The taste and flavor was fine but I am not kidding when I say it was four to five bites of steak. I know 12.99 is not a lot for a steak and I know sirloin is not the top cut but the size was ridiculous. Go to Logan's and get twice the steak for the same $$."}
{"text":"Excellent service tonight. Awesome dish of Shrimp and Grits, albiet a small serving, but hard to go wrong with stone ground goodness. Suggest they take a chance and expand the draft selection and put sword fish back on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great find near Charlotte!  Great beer selection, awesome wings, and delicious burgers & pizza. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the use of black, rather than kalamati olives on the veg pizza.  

We would definitely eat here again when in the area."}
{"text":"We had great food, great service, and a great time. I cannot remember our waiters name for the life of me but he was great. He was very sweet to my two young kids and actually turned one of the many tvs in the restaurant so they could watch cartoons. I thought that was great. He even brought the kids cups with hand drawn smiley faces on them. His name was an uncommon name and he was a great server. We never had to wait for a refill. Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch because it was one of those days and I wanted a good craft draft. Well let me tell you it was awesome! I started with the fried cherry peppers and they were crispy and delicious. The dipping sauce that came with them was just ok. Tasted more like mayo than anything else. For my entree I decided on the el diablo pizza. Wow very good. I rarely order pizza but had a good feeling about this one. They told me I was brave because it's hot. Good flavor and because I'm the queen of spicy it wasn't too hot for me. The cream cheese is a nice addition to cut the habaneros. Oh yes I had an appalachian it was one of the IPA's on tap. Very nice."}
{"text":"Shanice was awesome. She was probably the best server we have had in a long long time. She seemed very knowlegable about the food...and speaking of the food, it was nothing short of amazing. I had the beer burger (5 star) and the kids' was awesome too. Certainly recommend to friends!!"}
{"text":"Gastonia, you never cease to amaze me.  A restaurant chain with only 1 other location??  You're moving up in the world!  Amid the sea of Applebee's, Chili's, O'Charley's, and other Restauranty's, Tavern 24 is a shining beacon of hope for the restaurant scene in the Gashouse.  Solid menu with great options for bar food.  Great service.  Lots of seating.  Great selection of beers on tap (24 to be exact, which I will try in 7 months when I get this baby out of me).

The nachos were awesome.  I ate them for my meal, and it was more than enough for this gal.  Hubby got the beer burger, and it too was delicious and beer-y tasting, and the fries were large, crispy, and delicious.  Very very reasonable prices for some solid, tasty, food.

Congratulations, Tavern 24, I can no longer say that there are no decent restaurants anywhere in Gastonia.  You win."}
{"text":"Nice place. Came in for a couple of drinks and dinner but after one of the employees toddlers continued to \"make noise\" - and no sign of leaving, decided to go elsewhere to eat. Don't bring toddlers to work-especially if it's a bar"}
{"text":"Our visit started with super friendly service. We enjoyed our meal on their beautiful patio and once our server realized it was our first time here she briefly went over the menu and told us the most popular items. We started with the potato skins that were perfect- just the right amount of kick! We decided to have burgers for dinner. The blackened blue burger was delicious and the red pepper aioli sauce completed this yummy burger. The hubs got the bases loaded burger (minus the caramelized onions) which had beef, ham, chili and fries on it- it was HUGE and tasty!!!! Will def be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"COOL outdoor area...and when it's cold, the heaters WARM it all up too!
:)
wings are HUGE...burgers and pizzas are really good too.. attractive bartenders and everyone was friendly. Hard to believe you're in Gastonia."}
{"text":"The food was average and the service was the worst I've ever experienced. Saw the waitress twice. Once when she took our order and once again about 40 minutes later when she gave our check (another waitress dropped off our food). Was never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, not even with our empty cups pushed out to the end of the table. Ordered the Fish and Chips. The fish was soaking wet when it should have been crispy. I can definitely say we will NEVER go back. And that's solely based on the service."}
{"text":"Fantastic find!!! My son and I stopped here for lunch on our way home. The food was excellent, and the service was amazing! Tiffany, our server was a gem!!! She was so sweet to my son, and made our experience wonderful. I had the black and bleu burger- I highly recommend it. The jalapeños were the perfect addition to it."}
{"text":"Classic Bar and Grill. A lot of TVs and I sat at the bar to eat and have a few beers. I had a salmon salad which was very good and the salmon was well cooked. The beer special was $1 off the beers on tap and bottles. 

The service was very lacking though, the girls were not paying much attention and most of the time took a long time to get the order. 

It was somewhat annoying and I had to keep flagging them to get another beer or order my food.

If you are not looking for great service, this is a good place for some bar food and good variety of beers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some vittles yet again and this time, I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice beer list!  In my last review, I suggested that Tavern 24 have a beer list because the servers were having a hard time remembering what was on draft.  Well, wouldn't you know that they have a beer list now.  And it's laminated and easy to read.  Sweet!  Plus, they now have my favorite beer on draft - Yuengling!

This place just keeps getting better!  And you know I ordered a dozen bourbon wings because they are the bomb!  

We watched the local basketball game on the nice HD TV's which was sweet.

Recommend."}
{"text":"We went with 3 adults and 4 kids so we were really looking for family friendly and easy.  This place was definitely that, very accommodating to the kids.  The service was friendly, but overall pretty slow.  The food was good, but not great.  They do have salmon on the kids menu, which is rare and my daughter loved it."}
{"text":"First time here for NFL draft night. Service was adequate but certainly not spectacular. Wings were, by far the best thing we had. Great drinks. Ribbies had an odd texture. Pretzels were described as fresh made sticks but were typical grocery store pretzels. I'd come back to try again for the ribs alone."}
{"text":"I've visited Tavern 24 twice since they opened in Gastonia- once to eat in and once for take-out. I ordered the Stuffed Beer burger both times. This burger is marinated in beer, stuffed with cheese, and topped with caramelized onions. It is great! The fries were really good too. The service for our eat-in meal was pretty good, but we loved that they have reserved parking and a separate entrance for take-out orders. They also bagged and labeled each entree, which was a huge plus."}
{"text":"3.5 really. This is a nice place with a friendly staff. 
We got the mashed potato cakes as an appetizer, they were ok. Mashed potatoes and some veggies and seasoning, fried, with a mushroom gravy on top. We liked them ok, but nothing to rave about. My fella had the Southwestern black bean burger, and even added habaneros with fries. He says the burger gets 4 stars. I had the fish and chips, but subbed a salad for the chips. They were so flexible about substitutions. They accidentally gave me the chips anyway but did not charge extra. The fish was better that I expected. Lightly battered and crispy, not the least bit dry, and very flavorful. They lost a point from me by not having malt vinegar. If you serve fish and chips, you really must serve malt vinegar. It's like a rule. The salad was really good, I appreciated that it was a mixed greens salad, and not iceberg lettuce. All in all a good experience and would not hesitate to dine here again."}
{"text":"Good happy hour drink specials. Chicken Parm sandwich was above expectation, as was the steamed broccoli. It is a nice alternative to the loud, packed, chain steakhouse fare along the interstate. Multiple TVs to watch sports and a friendly bar staff."}
{"text":"I met an old high school friend here for dinner.  I was early, so I ventured over to the bar.  Before I could sit down, the bartender was asking for my order.  I asked for a drink menu and chose a Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.  My friend arrived, and we were seated at a very small booth that may have been too cramped if we were large people.  We were in the midst of a conversation, and, right before the punch line, a waitress interrupted us to take our order.  The staff training must focus on employees behaving like over eager puppies instead of being intuitive to pragmatic nuances, but, at least they were friendly.  My friend ordered a bacon and red onion pizza, which she said was good.  I ordered The Southwestern, a black bean veggie burger with cilantro aioli, guacamole, and jalapeño.  I requested no bun, which they honored.  The burger was delicious, accented by the accompaniments.  The fries were soft and warm, needing no additional seasoning.  The music was a mix of the most irritating pop music, the kind that features video game sounds.  But, at least it wasn't overwhelmingly loud.  My summary:  decent food and rapid service in a setting that was slightly elementary.  I predict that my friend and I will meet there again as it was a good halfway point for us."}
{"text":"The whole experience was pretty bad.  I ordered the nacho spinach dip for an appetizer and the baby back ribs as my entree.  About 15 minutes after ordering I was told they didn't have spinach dip so I changed to the chicken quesadillas.  Those came to the table not long after but there was no sour cream or salsa and hardly any chicken on them.  A half hour after ordering I was told that the bbq sause I ordered wasn't a available so I had to pick the only one they had.  When our food arrived 45 minutes after originally ordering it you could tell that it had been sitting in an oven for quite some time, all of our food was very dry and our plates were very hot.  

After our meal we had to wait about 20 minutes before we could get someone to bring us a check.  When it did arrive it had the incorrect amount of drinks and food items.  The manager did correct the mistake.  

The place was close to empty with 5-7 tables in the entire restaurant.  We have been there several times in the past and always had a good experience.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were closing in the near future since they were out of the items I ordered and several types of beers."}
{"text":"Service was great, and atmosphere was awesome. However, we went on a Sunday with the NFL games being on and they had sound which was good, but NO drink specials which I thought was odd. The burger I got was very dry and had zero flavor. My wife got the chicken Parmesan and it was very bland. It was just ok for us."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, friendly bartenders & servers. The calabash chicken is delicious and the blackened chicken pasta is dank! Love going here."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Our server was super sweet and honest about the menu which we really appreciated. She was also very attentive without hovering. All of the food we ordered was good. We got the nachos, chicken pasta, prime rib dip, and cheddar and beer soup. I did think the soup was a bit salty for my taste but nevertheless it was tasty. The presentation of all the dishes was also spot on. 

We will done here again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here on a Sunday afternoon. He got a burger and I got the chicken tenders with a side salad. We sat outside and it was gorgeous. The food was terrific and my husband tried my chicken tenders and he really liked mine too! We were both very satisfied. We will bring others here and be back!"}
{"text":"A nice new edition to Gaston Mall.
Went here to watch the Panthers @ Chargers with James.
Very casual pub style food.

We had wings and nachos. The wings were just OK, I like the rubbed style.  The chicken nachos were exceptional. Very fresh veggies, tasty chicken & the guacamole was better than average.

They have lots of HD's, gerat for watching any sports event. This place feels like more of a sports bar than a restaurant.

Better than average service,Amanda did a good job for us.

A Southeast regional franchise, the owner is from NY.

They have a nice patio area with overhead heating and many HD's. 

The floors were sticky and it seemed very disorganized at the hostess desk."}
