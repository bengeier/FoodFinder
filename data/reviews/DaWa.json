{"text":"Fresh, nice fried chicken, crispy and not oily, the inside was moist and juicy. Didn't like the Tao chicken. A bit on the pricy side for the portion."}
{"text":"I've tried all the boneless variations and found the two \"spicy\" ones to be very similar to each other. While the ones with sauce are more flavourful, I love the half and half for the \"unsauced\" ones to clean the palate, so to speak. Would give the place five stars for deliciousness and the great service. However, it feels just a tad overpriced for the fact that at this \"diner-style\" restaurant my husband and I easily spend $35 (on food only) by splitting a large half and half and both still feel a bit peckish.   Problem is our appetites are too big for a 10-piece entree each (or splitting a 20 or 24- piece entree), but are not big enough for two 20-piece entrees. Unfortunately there are really no reasonably priced items to fill in the gap without paying an additional $10 for another entree."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had high expectation for their fried chickens because of the reviews and words from friends but it turns out they were just okay. It was a bit dry we barely finished our plate. I find the place a bit plain too."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is insanely good. I'd say it's the best in Montreal, in fact. The French fries are an affront to French fries. Coleslaw is subpar. Please please please switch to homemade fries and make that coleslaw better!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant in NDG has hit the mark with their Korean chicken. For fast food it's very fresh and delicious, made to order. We tried the half & half dish with fried chicken and chicken with sauce. The fried chicken was moist and crispy and not heavily battered. The chicken with sauce was very tasty and fresh. It came with French fries and coleslaw. Good sign: most of the clients here were Koreans. At night they dim the lights and make it welcoming. We will definitively be back."}
{"text":"Fried chicken menu is huge with many choices of flavors and seasonings. However, compared to the fried chicken at Mon Ami or Shabu Shabu (local competitors ), I wouldn't recommend to people. The chicken is crispy but they do not stay crispy if you don't eat them right away. The skin starts to lose their firmness after a while. Portions are smaller than those served at MonAmi, but you pay the same prices."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Ordered food for delivery and it was 1.5hr late and when I called they were non-chalant & unapologetic. I cancelled. In a city like Montreal with so many restaurants this awful service has no place."}
{"text":"Love DaWa, but I find their chicken dishes on the pricey side. Service is friendly but can also be a hit or miss. Am also sad they charge extra for a bowl of rice. On the other hand, fantastic food, and really I'm here for the food and the mesmerizing kpop MVs."}
{"text":"Great little place. Love the chicken. Staff we're super nice and accommodating. Had the boneless fried chicken with rice and salad for 13 bucks (including tip) no drink tho. Not cheap but no expensive."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past year, every week at first and now every few months and never again. They used the worst cuts of meat in their sunsal-tao chicken and put way more salad than fries. When I asked the waitress to take back the salad and give me more fries, she said, Sorry, it's already been made.\" How stingy! And this after ordering and paying for extra pieces of chicken and giving her a generous tip! It's too bad because I really like the owner of the place. Best not to come here when it's busy (Saturday night and in summer for some reason), because quality of food and service goes down."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time today at lunch with my son as my date. Odd little place - don't go for the ambience, there isn't much.    It's not fancy or terribly cheap  and out of 8 tables, 5 of them had junk and supplies on them.      French tv blasting AND an English cd playing on the stereo at the same time makes for a lot of conflicting noise. We were the only diners the whole time we were there. He had the 1/2 & 1/2, I had a Tao meal. The chicken......really, really good.      The man working there was lovely and couldn't have been more attentive to us. I would absolutely go again but I'd order it to go."}
{"text":"I've heard a few people told me how good this place is, so I gave it a try and went there...  It's expensive and not that good.  I've tried the full chicken half-half. The sauce okay, and the half without sauce was just fried chicken. Really nothing wow. The mustard sauce that was on the side was also good. It was suppose to come with fries and coleslaw, we never got our coleslaw...  We also took Stir fried udon and spicy pork noodles. The Udon portion was tiny and was 8$. The portion is smaller than what a young kid could eat...  We initially wanted to order bulgogi, but the waiter told us they ran out of bulgogi (Saturday 6pm) and we were only 2 tables (they wanted bulgogi too, but no more)...  The service was so so...we ordered a pepsi that never came. We had to ask for napkins, because he brought us plates and forks only...even though another table asked for napkins before us. Technically, you should realize that you should bring napkins to other tables too..."}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick and family friendly near home for dinner with young kids.   Dawa is small, very clean looking and has a very simple (too simple) menu of fried chicken with different \"Korean\" sauces that seem dummed down for the Canadian palate.   The chicken is good and worth waiting for as it's freshly fried to order. The skin is crispy and made with rice flour but lacks some seasoning. The garlic teriyaki wings are great as is the sweet chilli sauce.   The freezer fries were over cooked and not great. What we really found missing was a fresher assortment of sides. Some steamed or saut√©ed vegetables would be nice to cut the rest of the greasy fried food.  Other than a salad option everything seems to be fried.   Apparently this is under new ownership so their liquor license is not going to be valid for another 3 months. It seems to be run by a very friendly Korean family who all pitch in.   If they make some additions to the menu and spruce up the ambiance a little bit more i could see our family coming by more often."}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken?! YES and YES! I was totally excited about this place and heard about it through seeing its name somewhere on my facebook news feed. I had this kind of fried chicken in California and I didn't realize Montreal had one too!   So when you arrive you have to order at the counter first for whatever type of chicken you want. My bf and I decided on the regular fried chicken number 7 i think. It came with coleslaw and fries. Really, it was just good, Like 12 notches better than your typical fried chicken. The skin was crispy, it wasn't overly greasy like dunked/bathed in oil, and the seasoning was spot on..   Now if I had to choose between the usual fast food joints like Mcdonalds, KFC, A&W etc and Dawa, I'd go for Dawa all the way. Dawa is still considered fast food I find, but Korean version and so delicious, It's really worth traveling to NDG for. It's easy to find: located right near the Korean epicerie.   Now go try that chicken!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is the best chicken in montreal. The chicken is warm and crispy. The clients and owner are friendly:):)"}
{"text":"KFC finally in Montreal..... Nope, this is not about the Colonel....I'm talkin bout Korean fried chicken. Finally a good spot in the town that does some yummy fried chicken. The Sunsal Pa-Dak is my favorite. Crispy fried boneless chicken served with spring onions and wasabi spiced soy sauce. Also tried their half and half. Two types of chicken (deep fried And sweet and spicy) served with fries. Not a big fan of chicken with bone though. Will definitely be back to try other dishes  Food : Great Service : O_o Ambiance : o_O Worth the price : Affirmative"}
{"text":"Went there on a rainy night, since its in my neighborhood. Ordered the half & half fried chicken & general tso. It came with fries & comeslaw but i asked for extra fries since i dont like coleslaw. The lady was nice wnough to ask the cook to fufill my request. I ordered it ti go. The meat was tender & full of spices. I need to go back & try their wings. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the waiting time was kind of long :(."}
{"text":"I visited Dawa a few days ago. In the interest of time I called my order 45min ahead of time. When I arrived, my food was not ready and the person at the counter was completely confused. Asked me what I had ordered and I explained accordingly. As it turns out, when I arrived home I had the wrong order, for the third time I may add. When I called the restaurant, they were unapologetic. Ok, decided to give them a chance to make up for the mistake. When I arrived my food was not ready, 30min after calling. Then I was lectured about how this was my fault and asked me to pay more than what I had already paid. Considering the unapologetic and argumentative attitude, I found the situation unacceptable, so I asked for my money back and left.  This establishment has absolutely no customer service and the management seems completely clueless about good business practice. My advice, stay away, there are other good establishments in the area that will appreciate your business.  Horrible experience. I am never coming back."}
{"text":"The taste was good, really good. But something is not right. I ordered the #2 family package, 18 pieces of spicy chicken for $23.99+tx. But there was only about four spoons of rice. COME-ON! Isn't it suppose to be a FAMILY PACKAGE?"}
{"text":"My dad and I visited here because he was craving for fried chicken and I've passed by this place a few times and wanted to check it out. We were well served by a friendly fellow, and our fried chicken was made fresh. I have to say that while the sauce was quite good, the chicken came out dry. If your specialty is fried chicken, it should never come out dry...Since this place is so well rated by others, maybe it was just bad luck. I may come back again and give it another chance should I ever crave fried chicken."}
{"text":"The best Korean chicken place in montreal. We got a bit of everything. My favourite was the garlic teriyaki chicken wings! We also got the order of 18'pieces half Korean sweet chilli and half original fried. The 18 pieces came with side of fries & unlimited refill coleslaw. We also had the yaki udon, which is on the sweeter side but I thought was very tasty and so did my boyfriend. We had left overs because we ordered so much but glad we did so we can also have it at home again later :) we will be returning very soon as if is very tasty. Also if u get take out, there is a Korean market right beside the restaurant so you can stop by there and pick up traditional ready made side dishes to go with your chicken! There is free parking in front of the restaurant (street) for an hour max :) they also deliver on just eat if you live within the vicinity"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was excellent. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.   Simply fried chicken dishes, with salad sides, and beer. Sooooo good.. Really yummy, regular fried pieces or with general Tao sauce. Some of the healthiest, tastiest fried chicken I have ever had. And for good prices.  I stopped eating fast food years ago because it was always like fool's gold, ie: with KFC (PFK), you crave it and then after feel gross and bummed out. This is the opposite, as the chicken is fresh there, and made to order.  For the two of us, it was about $30 (bt) for 12 boneless chicken pieces, two coleslaws, and fries, and two Asahi's 500ml. Making it even cheaper than KFC. And a really nice and simple arrangement inside, with friendly staff and an easy to read menu.  Lovely outdoor seating too on Sherbrooke for sunny days. I will totally go back."}
{"text":"Fried chicken wings is one of my ultimate favorite dishes ever since I was a baby! So when I heard about this place (listed on a list of 10 best places to eat chicken wings on nightlife.ca), I. HAD. TO. GO.   This is my kind of place for a Sunday night meal, so casual and without pretention. We ordered three flavors: the Tao wings, fried wings and terriyaki. My favorite was the latter.... perfectly crispy but wit some sauce on it, a little bit salty and a little bit sweet. We had the hot sauce on the side as my friend can't take spicy, and ohhhhh it was finger licking good especially with a Sapporo.  Even if they were broadcasting a CBC documentary on pigeons, I will definitely go back. One of the best chicken wings I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was good, we shared a half and half 10 piece meal. Half straight fried and half with sauce.   The chicken has not greasy at all! It was crispy fried and juicy. The only thing that I could say was for me it was missing a touch of salt.   The sauce was tasty with a little bite. I would have liked some kimchi, a little ban cha maybe?  All in all. I probably will go back"}
{"text":"I've actually never enjoyed eating fried chicken because most of the time the chicken is sand dry and it's hard to swallow. DaWa proved me wrong. Not only were their fried chicken moist but they contained no traces of oil. It's like comitting the perfect crime and erasing all traces of evidence. What kind of sorcery is this? The best kind I suppose. I also asked for the spiciest chicken they had and I wasn't dissapointed. To some, this might be a punch in the face but I found it comfortably spicy - definitely stronger than your typical bottle of Sriracha. It was spicy as biting into a fresh thai pepper but without the lingering burn.   Overall, the best fried chicken I've had at a reasonable price. I challenge chicken haters to still loathe chicken after they've been at this place."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken as much as I do, you should know that there is literally a world of it out there and it isn't just restricted to the American South or Kentucky for that matter.  Korean Fried Chicken is a bit different from it's American counterpart, it uses Rice Flour usually in its batter and throws in spices as well. What you get is an insanely crispy skin which just the right amount of juiciness inside. I came in last night since I was in the neighborhood and I constantly saw the delivery guy on the go as well as many people coming in for pick-up. When I noticed that most of the clientele coming in were Korean themselves, I automatically took that as a good sign.  And it is a sign well worth heeding. Thank God they deliver to my area. This is going to be another place to keep in mind for those winter days when I don't feel like cooking and would rather order in."}
{"text":"Great place for fried chicken. You can select half/half between their 2 flavors.   Nevertheless, I'm not really a fan of their sauce.  After ordering, the waitress told me the wait would be about 25 mins, but I think the first chicken pieces arrived earlier.  Chickens pieces are juicy are taste delicious. I will come back! The place is not really big, there's enough space for about 15 people."}
{"text":"You guys need to stop taking cash only for deliveries and charging both taxes on handwritten bill (you are not remitting the money to government) and then snatching the bill out my hand!! It's insulting that you are collecting taxes under a false pretence and pocketing. Thieves!!"}
