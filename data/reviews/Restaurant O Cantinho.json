{"text":"First time patron .... The seafood platter was delightful and perfectly roasted. The staff were all colorful characters with Megan trumping all . What a place to eat Mediterranean style with family and friends ."}
{"text":"Had the mixes seafood plater the shrimp really stood out.  Next will go for the giant shrimps dish."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend, best surprise in Montreal. Good price for a huge plate. Had the half chicken and it came on a huge plate. Shows to you the best restaurants aren't on MTL Blog!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for charcoal grill. Love the pork and chicken. One of the cheapest chicken in town, beside their express counter on Henri Bourassa.  Service has always been great for me. They have a liquor license, unlike the express counter. If you go during prime hours, there will be a lineup, so be prepared to wait.  I love this restaurant, very inexpensive, less than a large pizza."}
{"text":"Having lived in the Azores as a teenager, I'm always interested in trying Portuguese food when I have the chance. We made a day trip to Montreal and when looking at restaurants near our last stop of the day, this one popped up. The reviews were so positive that we decided to give it a go, and we weren't disappointed. But we definitely have to remember to order less food in the future! We got 2 appetizers, the seafood (octopus/squid) salad and grilled chorizo. The salad was a standout and huge! Then we decided to order the mixed meat and mixed seafood plates for our entrees. This way, we each get to eat half and then trade so we get a good variety of food. Everything was delicious and we came home with enough leftovers for another meal.   I had read reviews criticizing the service, but we had a great server, who paid just enough attention without being annoying and was interested to hear that we were from the US.   All in all, I'd definitely go back, but next time, I think we'll just order 4 appetizers, which will certainly be enough food for the 2 of us to share! The portions are large and with the bread & olives waiting for you on the table, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"We ended up there with a whole hockey team of teenagers and their parents on a busy Valentine's Day . I cannot rave more about the place and their hospitality. The food was amazing and their house wine was great. It made our tournament trip to Montreal much better."}
{"text":"Cool Place (in the back room if you are too hot, or terrace i summer) Very warm place (in front, close to the grill). So, depending on your mood, this place will warm your soul. Awesome fish! Delicious ribs. Good veggies and fries. Decent wine list. Fair prices. GO there! Worth a try."}
{"text":"ate there on Oct.27, had the half chicken spicy and it was delicious, one of the best I've ever had. Service was friendly however very slow"}
{"text":"Un merveilleux restaurant portugais la qualité est sans compromis et les prix très raisonnable. Les grillades sont délicieuses surtout les côtelettes d'agneau."}
{"text":"Une autre belle découverte! Situé dans le quartie, ce beau petit restaurant est tout a fait l'image que que je me fais d'une rôtisserie portuguais. Malgré un service inégale, un décors Kitch et le fait que ce soit très bruyant, la vrai raison de visité ce resto reste l'excellente nourriture. Le poulet est excellent (palettes sensibles soyez prudent si vous le prenez épicés), la pieuvre hors de ce monde et les déssert traditionnel sont aussi très bon.  En été, la terrasse rends l'endroit plus charmant. J'y retournerais régulièrement."}
{"text":"While in Montreal we planned to visit at least one Portuguese restaurant for our anniversary, so we ended up deciding to try out Restaurant O Cantinho. This restaurant was about a thirty minute bus ride from our flat, but is seemed to be more authentic than some of the other in the area and we were willing to give it a shot.  When we entered the restaurant it was bustling with patrons but we were seated quickly. The wait staff here isn't the most friendly in the world (limited conversation and very brief interactions) but they were quick at providing us the traditional bread, butter and olives.   The prices at this restaurant were reasonable, especially for their seafood, which can be one of the biggest drawbacks for dining at a Portuguese restaurant.   We ended up buying the lulas grelhadas (grilled squid) for an appetizer which was delicious. The squid was cooked to perfection and the salad that accompanied it was good as well. For our main course my wife got a steak and I got polvo grelhado (grilled octopus) which were also both delicious. The fries that came with the steak were the best we have had in the city, and the rest of the food was perfectly prepared.  In the end, this restaurant is five stars worthy in my book, but the wait staff again wasn't the most receptive and on a few occasions a bit off putting. We would definetly dine here again and encourage others to do the same, but be prepared for a lackluster experience when it comes to service."}
{"text":"Je suis tellement traditionnelle et prévisible, je commande toujours le quart de poulet cuisse avec sauce épicé. Formule gagnante pour moi en plus d'être très abordable. If it's not broken why fix it.  Resto vivant, service inégal, un jour le service est sympa un autre on se demande quelle mouche les a piqué.... Çà fait partie de leur charme... On est un peu coincé, il y a du bruit et on mange presque sur la table du voisin, mais çà aussi fait partie du charme. Pas de souper en tête-à-tête ici."}
{"text":"Muy bueno el ambiente, el servicio, y pedimos pollo a la brasa y estuvo muy bueno. Solo el aderezo de la ensalada, no estuvo a la altura del plato. Sugiero algo tipo aceite de oliva, limon, sal y oregano."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a friend, and it did not disappoint. Their chicken was delicious! Make sure to get their chilli hot sauce with your order. We also ordered the sausage and I wasn't a fan of that. I was expecting more of an Italian sausage taste but it tasted more Iike dry ham."}
{"text":"We order take out from them since we live nearby. Huge portions! The chicken tastes the most like northern Portugal. (My husband is portuguese so I am quite familiar) the bifana is also very good.   Only recommendation I have is that their pasteis de bacalhau should have less green onions. And it was overcooked. Still, I recommend this place to everyone in the east end."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé d'utiliser Yelp pour connaître les bonnes places autour de chez moi. J'ai donc pris une marche et je suis allé chez O Cantinho, avec zéro attentes.   L'endroit était à moitié en rénovation, mais c'était plein de gens pareil. Il y avait des groupes qui arrivaient après moi, très achalandé comme place, je me suis dit que c'était bon signe.   J'ai commandé l'agneau avec les frites pour emporter. J'attendais mon repas assis gentiment à une table, mais il y avait tellement de gens qui arrivaient que le gérant m'a promené de table en table pour pouvoir placer les gens. Mais c'était plutôt rigolo.   Le gérant plutôt sympa bien que très occupé. Il m'a remis mon repas avec une carte d'affaire, me conseillant fortement de commander par téléphone avant de venir chercher le repas la prochaine fois. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de place pour attendre les take out.   L'agneau était vraiment excellent et les frites... Incroyables. J'y retournerai c'est certain."}
{"text":"I like this resto! I came here for the first with my family to celebrate our birthday. I admit I did not have high hopes for this place because I honestly found it a bit ghetto,  the neighborhood isn't that great and it's far but the food is quite good! I brought my boyfriend here because we wanted something fairly inexpensive with big portions. I recommend the grilled octopus. It's so huge and it's so tender! I also recommend the fried calamari. I've had the chicken before and although its good I rather go to ma poule mouillée for chicken. The lamb is good but there's better stuff on the menu. The house wine is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"A great place on the east end for Portuguese chicken! Their spicy sauce is really tasty and the prices are pretty decent for the plate they serve. It's quite a big restaurant and does get busy on weekends. They have a good variety of chicken, fish and meat."}
{"text":"Stationnement sur la rue un peut difficile mais à l'entrée de le resto avec Terrace extérieur ouvert je peut sentir une atmosphère excitant avec accueil amical et service rapide d'un vers d'eau, petite olive et pain portugaise. J'ai commander une entrée de 3 crevettes and quart de cuisse épicé."}
{"text":"Le seul restaurant avec bcp d'ambiance dans le quartier. Il y a toujours du monde, ca roule, les assiettes sont excelents, la sauce piquante une delice. Mangez sur place ou commander par telephone, il n'y a pas de salle d'attente."}
