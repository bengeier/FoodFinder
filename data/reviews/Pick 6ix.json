{"text":"Found it over priced for what you get. Overall atmosphere is nice. Serves was great and one young woman came and gave a great explanation on the sushi. We all struggled with the menu, it was tough ordering and would suggest adding carbs of some sort. 
Now for the washroom, I have attached a picture of the rags underneath the sinks. Dirty rags and that is disgusting and if the washrooms are dirty so is the kitchen.  You would not witness this in McDonalds.  When you are paying an average of $150 per person- you be the judge."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this restaurant has such low ratings but here goes mine:

Visited Pick6ix on Thursday, April 19th and our server's name was Julianna. We ordered the snow crab roll, fried rice, the kalbi, and the chicken gyozas. They were all very tasty not to mention the maki roll was really fresh. The vibe of the restaurant is a lot of fun because during commercials they have a DJ who plays music. I mainly gave this place a 5 star because of the service that Julianna provided. I was having a severe heartburn and Julianna was kind enough to see how I was feeling and even provided a vinegar remedy to help alleviate my symptoms. She was sincere and kept on checking on us until I felt better. I highly recommend her a server and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The music is awesome - Sat night!  Food and service was...not what I expected at a place like this!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant.....
The service was excellent and the restaurant itself is impressive, but the food was mediocre. And for some reason theres a bunch of food not on the menu that you can order? We started with empanadas that honestly weren't that great. The shell didn't taste fresh, reminded me of something you'd microwave. For my entree I ordered steak fritz ($30). The fries was very plain and the steak was very plain. The highlight of dinner was my boyfriends fillet mignon
 which was delicious and reasonably priced for that cut ($50) The portions are small, the prices are high and the food is underwhelming. Normally, if I'm not crazy about a restaurants food but I like the atmosphere it will become a happy hour spot. Not the case for Pick 6ix. $14 caesars that came in tiny glasses and weren't-even-good."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for Memorial Day weekend and am a die-hard Drake fan so I had to check this place out, despite the bad reviews. Unfortunately I was not impressed and disappointed. The atmosphere and music was great. Our server was very attentive, but that was about it. The restaurant was warm, I don't think the AC was on. We got water on tap but wasn't provided ice. The water was warm, the pitcher was not chilled and seemed to be sitting for hours. We even asked for a cup of ice, but they didn't get the hint. They did not have actual appetizers on the menu and did not list any beers. The menu was small and so were the portions. Extremely over priced. We ordered a roll of sushi and fazzoletti, it wasn't anything special. You'd need a couple of entrees to get full. The sushi was served with a fork instead of chopsticks, which was also bizarre."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the reason my crew and I decided to venture over here while in Toronto was because of the Drake buzz. We were looking for something to do on a Saturday night so this seemed like the obvious answer. 

The bar is extremely trendy and luxurious, with awesome lighting, mirrors, and cool seating. The staff was fun and friendly. I was feeling good vibes all over as soon as we walked in. 

We had already eaten dinner at a restaurant nearby so we skipped food and just focused on drinks. Their cocktails range from $12 - $18. Out of the three that I tried, my ranking is as follows:

1) Lucuma Loca - made with gin, ginger sour, lucuma, and prosecco. This cocktail usually comes with white peach purée, but since they were out of it that night, I asked for them to substitute it with passion fruit purée. It was FANTASTIC. Definitely my favorite cocktail of the night! And the gold flakes didn't hurt. ;)

2) Passion Punch - made with Remy Martin VSOP, Bacardi, passion fruit purée, ginger beer, and bitters. This cocktail was a close second. I'm not sure what exactly it lacked, I just know that I liked the previous one better.

3) Up All Night - another cocktail made with Bacardi but this time combined with lemongrass syrup. Not good, not bad, but wouldn't get it again. Not sweet and fruity enough for my liking. 

Would I return here when I'm in Toronto? Possibly, if I'm looking for a fun and flashy place to grab a cocktail. Probably wouldn't make a night out of it though... unless of course Drake happens to make an appearance. =P"}
{"text":"You may have trouble getting reservations to this place online but they usually take walk-ins whether you're sitting at the bar or the dining room. I'll start with the decor. Not necessarily my vibe but it is very swanky, lots of gold and accent colours with velvet purple chairs. They also have a live DJ, which gives this place a great vibe. I originally went for cocktails and they tasted great. Price wise they vary from $12-$18 so pretty standard. I got the AKAN SOUR. Like I said, tastes great but beware...they are not very strong. The food is generally tapas (sharing style) and there is lots of sushi! For $16 you get about 8 sushi pieces / rolls. You can also opt for an entree that you can eat with you gold cutlery for much more! One thing to note: the staff is super friendly. Our server was Gabriella and she was great and went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed.

This place is still going through some growing pains but it is still early and I'm confident they'll get it right. If you want to see great decor, a swanky vibe and have some great food... Pick 6ix is a must.

Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"Had higher expectations based on the wait to get a reservation.

The service was fantastic our waitress was extremely friendly, and helpful. She was attentive just enough and that was probably the highlight of the night.

The menu wasn't available online so we didn't really know what to expect.

After having ate at Frings I expected it to be pricy and smaller portions.

The server suggested we do tapas style to try a bit of everything - and we went with her suggestions.

My most liked item was the lobster roll, there was nothing amazing about the rest (pictures attached).

After we finished eating we still had a glass of wine to finish and almost felt the pressure to leave. The restaurant was empty so I thought that was weird. We hasn't even asked for our bill and received it. Wasn't impressed as I did want another glass of wine."}
{"text":"I would honestly say that this restaurant is deserving of a rating closer to 1.5 stars.

Going in I had low expectations given all of the horrid reviews by fellow Yelp members. It's safe to say that those low expectations were met. Let's talk about service first. I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and had brought in cake for the birthday girl. We were told the plating fee was $6 a person. That's okay - we didn't need the cake to be plated so we asked if they could just bring the cake out for a photo but unfortunately they told us they would have to charge $6 a person anyway just to bring the cake out... never mind then. When we tried to get our cake back at the end of the night, the waitress at the front was nothing short of rude and obnoxious. We waited around for quite a long time before someone finally helped us grab the cake from the fridge.

Poor, pretentious service aside, let's move onto the drinks and food. Cocktails are very pricey here as expected - you're looking to spend almost $20. For the two of us we shared the lobster spaghetti (please do yourself a favour and skip this very mediocre dish - at $39 the lobster was tiny and the spaghetti was a huge disappointment), the snow crab maki (tasted decent but not sure it's worth $22), and the spicy salmon roll. Our friends ordered other dishes like the chicken sandwich and the hot stone bowl, and I think the general consensus is that the food is average at best but overpriced.

Another thing to note is that their washroom doors are kind of finicky! My friend almost got trapped - what more can I say?

Horrible service + overpriced and mediocre food = definitely would not recommend. The Drake hype is really just that... all hype and no substance. Unless they improve their menu and fire their snobby staff, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant, nice looking people but be prepared to be disappointed..... Read all the reviews before going for a birthday so my expectations weren't that high to begin with... But no clamato to make ceasars??  Ok.... What kind Tequila do you have? All kinds.... I will have a Don Julio Reposado... No? Ok Blanco then... 4 shots later they were out of that too.. Patron Silver please... No? Ok wtf do you have then just bring that... Like come on guys...  Food was pretty good, fish was fresh so no complaints there. Miso soup was bland.. Chefs table gave us a nice view of the kitchen which I enjoyed.. I enjoyed the music also..
Reviews are all on point so if you're gonna go, just go already.. If you're on the fence and are concerned with service and experience try somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Initially was surprised at the rating of this place but then again, my friends and I were walking down the street, needing to catch a bus in 15min so decided to grab the quickest coffee. We walked in and went straight to the bar, of course admiring all the beauty around us at the same time. We told the ladies that we were in a rush and asked for the bill as soon as we ordered our drinks. They were fast and professional & really sweet. We really wanted to come back for lunch or dinner but they were fully booked for the short amount of vaca time we were in Toronto. Would have loved to sit outside for lunch or inside for dinner. Next time!"}
{"text":"Love the environment, service and food. Went for brunch and stayed for the after party. Brunch was great, I tried the mimosas, ceasar and the mojitos. Their eggs Florentine was great, the potatoes were a little over cooked but regardless I thoroughly enjoyed. The party was good, VERY crowded, but good!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a few friends and ordered several items to share. The sushi offerings were basic at best but priced surprisingly high for the quality of ingredients used. The food was really mediocre, having been to Fring's multiple times I expected similar quality in the food. We also tried their take on a hamachi crudo, carpaccio, chocolate lava cake and cheesecake. All were edible but nothing memorable. 

The servers were inexperienced and the service was very haphazard, water glasses left empty and dishes forgotten. Ambience was ok, the decor is good but a bit garish. Overall I think they missed the mark on this one. It is nowhere near comparable to the other offering in pricing, quality of food or service."}
{"text":"Food was good 
music was good
Overpriced
Desserts not that great
Sushi is good
Cappuccino is good
Drinks are good"}
{"text":"I like the place. Lots of local toronto industry people always around. Young and good looking crowd. Food is a bit over priced and small in portions. Lounge / club sort of feel to it as well. The night i went we had rented the private room as it was a large crowd. We had allocated time slot as our table was reserved for the NBA team \"houston rockets\". 

This place is tailored for the rich and private events as I got the impression that the status quo were encouraged to dine and leave. 

Good experience tho."}
{"text":"Vegetarian review...

Not a lot of vegetarian options. Food was delicious. Portions are small and overpriced. Cocktails were creative. Staff was friendly. 

I've heard the decor as being described as being on the inside of a bottle of Virginia Black...spot on. 

I would go back for drinks"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday recently.  Apparently Drake was in the big room with the closed door near the entrance.  It was busy, but not crowded.  The patio was the busiest area, and there were plenty of clout-chasers trying to get noticed.  We sat at the inside bar which was great for people watching, and had a few Bacardi Black and coke drinks.  They don't have Goslings.  Nice ambiance, good music, and interesting mix of people.  The entire place is not as fancy as you may imagine from a person who possesses almost a hundred million dollars, so don't go balls out on dressing up.  We'll have to check out the food next time."}
{"text":"Ambiance was fabulous. The idea is a restaurant and sports bar but serving higher quality and healthier options. A nice high end sports bar with quality food. 

I love the lighting and sofas. My server, Theresa was very attentive. She addressed and listened to all my requests and concerns. I am very happy with her service. 

The cocktails were really good, my favourite was the Lucuma Loca and then the Passion Punch.  I tried three different cocktails. 

Drink #1: Yuzu & Royal Jelly- Grey goose Cerise Noire, Pick6ix Royal Jelly amaro, Yuzu sour, Sosa.

Drink #2 Lucuma Loca- Buddha's hand Bombbay East, ginger sour; lucuma, white peach purée, prosecco 

Drink #3 Passion Punch- Remu Martin VSOP, Bacardi Gold Velvet, falernum, passion fruit purée, ginger beer, Peychaud's Bitters

Main: Lobster Spaghetti a la Montreal Style Bolognese, butter-poached lobster, Grand Padano. I wasn't a huge fan of this as I find the tomato sauce overpower the whole plate and the lobster tail was too small and tasted a bit undercooked.  But they have kindly exchanged another dish for me. 

Main: The miso-marinated black cod was very nicely done. A thick cut of black cod. The flavour was good and the seasonal butternut squash purée went well with it. A good marriage of all flavours in the dish.

For the dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, nice and warm. Not too sweet. A very nice dessert.

I was craving for sashimi, so I ordered the 9 pieces of sashimi. Nicely decorated with gold flakes. The salmon sashimi had bits of sesames on it.  I loved the seabream sashimi, it was even better than a lot of Japanese restaurants. I really enjoyed it. I should have read more about this restaurant to learn that the co-owner and Chef Antonia Park was in charge of the menu. I would have focused on the the sushi and sashimi. 

I will definitely come back for more miso cod, more cocktails and sashimi! And to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pathetic! Just received a call from the restaurant cancelling my legitimate reservation made weeks ago. Last week they announced Friday March 9th as 'Drake Night' at a price of $2000 a table. 

To accomodate Drake they are cancelling all legitimate reservations in favour of people that paid $2000 a table for 'Drake Night'

What kind of patheitc way is this to run a business? 

Is this a restaurant or a night club?"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was underwhelming because the restaurant was hyped up. It has a very nice interior and decent service. The sushi was standard. I had some sashimi, nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and California roll. The fish was fresh and delicious. The rolls and nigiri were good, but the plain-ness of it all was underwhelming. All the fish had a slight smoked flavour to it was well. I also had a sausage bun. That had some great toppings (liked the Korean fusion) and the side salad was delicious! I think it's a nice place for a meal, food and atmosphere good. I gave it a 3/5 because it wasn't very differentiating/unique in terms of food (standard sushi, but great quality fish). Perhaps dinner is more unique."}
{"text":"Pick 6ix? More like pick somewhere else.
The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has great ambiance, but that's about all it has going for it. It was pretty packed when we arrived late on a Friday night so we grabbed some seats at the bar for drinks. We were seated for over ten minutes before a bartender even acknowledged our existence or offered us a menu. We tried almost all the drinks on their cocktail menu and they were very well crafted and well made. I love cocktails so it's very important to me that everything goes well together and belongs in the cocktail. By the time we wanted to eat something, the kitchen had already closed so unfortunately we didn't try any of their food. It is disappointing for a place that's marketing themselves as a both a restaurant and lounge to not even offer a simpler late night menu.  On top of that, the service we received from 2/3 of the bartenders was very disappointing and robot-like. It was as though they did not want to be there. I can forgive bad food, long wait times, etc... but bad service is almost always unacceptable."}
{"text":"I took a first date here.  We stuck mostly to the sushi rolls and sashimi and their mixed drinks.

The atmosphere was casual but trendy, and the interior reflected that. The staff are very attentive.

The quality of the food was excellent, but nothing we ordered seemed mind blowing. Just very well executed.

The drinks, now that game was on fire. I must have tried half their mixed drink menu, and loved everyone.  The edible gold flakes on top looses it's luster after the second drink though.  

Music in this place was awesome.

This place is pricey and it is in the financial district, our bill for two people and tip was close to 300$."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day and quite frankly, the best thing about our meal was the company. Oh, and maybe the miso soup. The service we received was okay, slow at times... and they even forgot to bring us our last order. 

I've had better sushi for a lot less. We ordered the tuna roll, spicy salmon, snow crab and the lobster roll. The lobster roll was the best of the bunch however, that beautiful lobster tail in the middle was just an empty shell. Disappointing. 

The tuna roll also had an unusual taste to it. None of us could quite put our finger on it. It almost tasted like mint. It was rather odd. 

Honestly, Drake should stick to music because he certainly doesn't know sushi. This was definitely NOT god's plan."}
{"text":"Overall I would not recommend the food but would recommend dropping by here for cocktails and for the atmosphere. The decor pays homage to the 70s, the 80s, and the 90s and it works. It's a beautiful spot which is fun and brash without feeling overwhelming or cheap. Also the music was great! We made reservations 10 days in advance but they somehow didn't have space for us anyways so we were seated in the bar area which is too brightly lit to really get into the ambiance. Would definitely recommend dimming the lights in there. Cocktails were good (we had black widows) but it was frustrating that half the cocktails on the menu weren't available due to a shortage in ingredients. It was 7:30 on a Wednesday - how can that even be? The food was much less desirable. We had a sushi roll as an appetizer (spicy salmon roll). The fish was fresh but there was too much spicy mayo without enough actual spice, and the roll was pretty loosely rolled. More in line with what you'd find at a good quality ayce sushi joint. The appetizer we wanted (the gyoza) was not available. In fact most of the dishes we wanted were not available. I took a friend as a birthday treat and both the Gyoza and the short rib that he wanted were unavailable which was really disappointing. He ended up having the teriyaki chicken which was really dry, and poorly seasoned to the point that it had almost no flavour. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered off the light menu and got the Asian style pallela. Overall the sausage in the dish tasted cheap (and stale), the chicken breast I added was very dry and almost flavourless, and there wasn't enough seasoning in the dish itself for it to have real flavour. I barely ate any of it but the fried egg was definitely a nice touch. Since my friend couldn't get the drink, app, or main he originally wanted I asked the server to give us a small treat with a candle in it. They wouldn't provide it free of charge (which is okay even though it was a bit strange considering our overall poor culinary experience). It was ok. The crust has a nice flavour and the density of the cheesecake was perfect. I'm not personally a fan of citrus cheese cakes but that's just me. We did see a bunch of famous people while we were there including ty dolla sign and some of drakes ovo crew. Overall I would recommend people come here for drinks, the vibe, the music, and to people watch. At $75/head for a shared appetizer, 2 mains, and a shared dessert with way below average food, so so service, and half a menu that's not even available - I would strongly recommend not coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"New chef and new menu are wins. Best fried chicken sandwich anywhere and curried lamb shank served with astounding roti! Service was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We were anticipating trying this place given all the hype. Our friend had made a reservation for 10 people a month ago to celebrate her birthday. Our reservation was set for 8:30pm, everyone arrived on time and my other friend and I were about 20 minutes late.

 As soon as we got there the server was attentive to our needs and because everyone was ready to order, we put our orders in right away so it wouldn't be a hassle for the kitchen. The drinks came out first and it was the \"Black Widow\", which was used with \"Virginia Black\". I didn't enjoy it at all so I sent it back and tried another one for replacement. After getting our drinks, it took 40 minutes for everyone to get their food which I think is a bit too long considering it wasn't busy at all. My friend and I still had no dishes in front of us only for the server to come back to us to tell us that there was some sort of discrepancy in the kitchen which I found to be confusing because everything would have been punched in at the same time. 

After an hour later, I finally got my food and during the wait, a manager hadn't come to speak to me and at least apologize for the inconvenience. The Salmon was awesome, the vegetables were fresh and the portion was pretty small. We were ready to order another round of beverages along with dessert; majority of the table ordered the Dark Chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and this time we were warned that the cook time on that dish would be about 15 minutes which we agreed would be fine. My second beverage order took 20 minutes to come out and like I said before, the restaurant was not busy. 

About 20 minutes later, the dessert came out and the presentation was beautiful. Within the first 3 minutes and about 3 bites into the dessert, I pulled out the LONGEST strand of light brown/blonde hair out of the lava cake. The birthday girl had given me hers and ANOTHER short black hair was in the ice cream. At the point, I was beyond livid and our entire table was in utter shock, given all the issues, and this was clearly the last straw. We called our server over and he rushed to FINALLY get the manager. The manager came over and honestly it was just a bag of excuses as to why things were handled the way they were. He claimed that the restaurant was busy, they had multiple parties and that he'd been working 55 days straight. 

At that point, no one wants to hear anymore excuses. I explained to him that me out of everyone else had the most issues and everyone else then chimed in to state their concerns and issues as well. The manager Adam, then asked us \"what can I do for you\"? we literally just looked at him and said \"you're the manager and thats your job to figure that out\"...we honestly just wanted our bills and wanted to get out of there because it was then 11:30pm and we've already been there for 3 hours and had a horrible experience as it is. 

Again, we waited 40 minutes for our bills only for there to be a mix a up again. The manager had our server come back to give us ONE bill when we requested separate bills - he comped the beverages and the desserts and my meal after waiting for an hour for it wasn't discounted at all. 

When he came back to the table we explained to him that my meal should have at least been discounted given the wait and all the issues. He tried to argue it and we just said we'll pay for whatever and we wanted to get out of there asap and we would be writing a review. His response was: \"what's the point of discounting your bill if you're just going to trash us right?\" We couldn't believe that a MANAGER would ever say something like that after ALL of the discrepancies. He also stated that the hair could've been anyone at this table when it was MY meal and no one else touched it. Anyways, the overall experience was horrible and we plan to never go back there again.

 The food was good but clearly not sanitary, the manager was extremely and utterly disrespectful and avoided us till the very end of our visit, and the drinks were between not good and mediocre. The only good thing that came out of this experience was our server Stew. He was very attentive, apologetic and communicated with us through our entire experience and we all feel bad he had to deal with all of that at our table."}
{"text":"we had such high hopes for this place and we really wanted to like it so much more than how we felt leaving. it was tough getting a reservation for around 6 or 7pm for a big group so we ended up with dinner reservation at 4:15. front staff were friendly; coat check was a plus. we were about 10 min early but seeing as how it was such an early dinner we were seated right away. it took forever to get service. 12 minutes later- and our server was apologetic bec she was in a meeting that took longer than expected. (at least that was the story she went with- though she ended up being super nice and friendly so points for that. we had a change in servers later on and she wasn't as friendly but oh well.) i had sour something cocktail suggested by the server and it was pretty good. dress code-none that we could tell. a group of girls were dressed like they're at a club. then a group of guys and girls were dressed in regular street/casual clothes. remember this was at 4:15pm. now for food. le sigh. i guess ppl come here for the drinks and the partying. food fell so short. the short rib wasn't even a short rib looked and tasted more like pot roast. the gyoza was okay but probably the best thing we ate. presentation were nice and i think that's all they had going. taste was so lacking that for the price point we came out super disappointed. oh well. i guess at least we can say we came and experienced it. though with a bit of regret. one and done."}
{"text":"WORST STAFF.. NO MANNERS Left as soon as I walked in..the hostess was so disrespectful and rude."}
{"text":"I was skeptical or going here based on the reviews but figured I'd give it a shot.

1 star for the good atmosphere and setting.

Service was horrendous, I was there with 3 others and it took over an hour for a roll of sushi each which was mediocre at absolute best. 

The Japo burger my friend got was so poor, dry old bun and a crappy burger in general.

Will not be back would never recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriends birthday dinner on a Friday night around 10, and after reading mediocre reviews I was a bit worried, but it was better than I expected. I'd probably stay away from the passion punch or whatever drink they call it, tastes WAY more of ginger than anything else. 
We ordered:
Snow crab maki, chicken kara age, steak (I forget the name), and the chicken teriyaki bowl. The maki rolls and chicken Kara age were exceptional, and my boyfriend really enjoyed his steak. The teriyaki bowl could've been better, a bit too spicy in my opinion. 
PROS:
The food was pleasant, the service was quick. And there was good music. 
CONS:
I feel like this place is super hyped up so be aware of all the girls and guys coming in to hit the angles and get those IG worthy pics. While the music is good it's a bit too loud so don't expect to make proper conversation while you're there. The biggest flaw was that I specifically requested NO avocado in my sushi due to allergies... yet the server still brought the rolls with avo in it and luckily while I was holding a roll mid air about to toss it in my mouth, my boyfriend noticed the avocado and swatted my hand away before I could eat it. Phew. Had to wait another 10 minutes before we could get the servers attention. 

I probably wouldn't go back, since it was more of a one time experience thing. There's definitely better places in the 6ix."}
{"text":"Sorry Drake, I love your music but definitely not your restaurant...

Came here for lunch on a Thursday.  We couldnt make any reservations online as it was fully booked so we decided to walk-in.  The restaurant was not full at all so we were able to get a table no problem.  

The server recommended that the menu is tapas style so we ordered four things to share among the three of us.  The beef carpaccio ($22), the open face gyoza ($16), snow crab maki ($22) and grilled chicken salad ($19).  The food was really mediocore and average, nothing too special considering the price that we paid.  AND, the portions were MINISCULE. My boyfriend actually left with a hungry stomach. 

The worst part of lunch was definitely the service. We ordered our food at 12:45pm and we waited a good 40 mins before the food came out.  We had to ask our server three times about our food.  When the food came, the server gave us the bill at the same time (as she knew we were in the a rush).  We were eating and settling the bill at the same time (super hectic).  Not to mention, the water glasses were never filled. 

Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I do not typically write reviews on restaurants. In this case, however, I feel compelled too on account of a very rude, disrespectful and non- hospitable manager.

 A member of our group began to fall asleep at the table- not because he was drunk, but because he was tired from a long flight and rigorous week of work. 

The manager then proceeded to assemble a group of security guards around our table and within earshot, discuss with the waitress how he \"wanted this guy out\". He was not discrete about this, but actually very blatant.

We asked to finish the round of drinks that we had just ordered and he unceremoniously told us that we had ten minutes and also the he was \"being cool\"

Upon establishing with this manager and what seemed to be his entire security detail that our party of three had just spent 6-700 dollars on food and drinks over the course of dinner and that for a restaurant that bills itself as high end, his behavior was off color, he proceeded to tell me that people regularly spend 50 to 60 thousand dollars a night there.

I eat at really nice restaurants- Michelin rated regularly- and the service at nice restaurants is typically impeccable. The manager at Pick 6, however showed a complete lack of class, tact and hospitality and I struggle to understand how a restaurant of this caliber hired someone with such a lack of decorum for such an important role.

The food was alright but the experience was completely ruined by sub standard staff. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my fiancé and 2 friends. Our expectations were a bit curbed due to the reviews but we honestly enjoyed our meal here. We arrived a bit early for our reservation but were promptly seated at a table in what I presume will be their outdoor patio once the weather heats up (covered and enclosed at the time). Our only issue was that our table was in between 2 heat lamps which were turned on but we told our server that it was getting too hot so they shut one off. 

When the menus were provided, I noticed that they were different from what has been posted and our server advised us that they had just received new menus the day before. I ordered one of their signature cocktails, Passion Punch, which was one of the better drinks that I've had. It consisted of passion fruit, Remy Martin and ginger beer and was so tasty and refreshing. 

For starters, we shared the poke bowl and Asian salad. The poke bowl had nice flavours but felt like there was too much rice. The salad provided a nice contrast as it was similar to a slaw. 

For entrees, we were feeling like sushi so we ordered the snow crab, soft shell crab and shrimp tempura rolls. My fiancé was craving seafood as well and ordered the king salmon bowl. Between the 3 rolls, I enjoyed the snow crab roll the most as it had some torched fish on top, which gave a nice warm element to the dish. The soft shell crab roll was good also and the shrimp tempura roll would have been better if the tempura had been crispier. The king salmon bowl was massive but was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it. It was difficult to finish only because we had so much rice from the poke bowl and sushi rolls. 

Our server was very attentive and there was not a single time that we had to ask for water as it was constantly refilled. Although it is it pricey, we would definitely return, perhaps in the summer once the patio is open."}
{"text":"Loved the environment and music. Food was good but a bit overpriced tbh. I got the soft shell crab maki to share and japa burger which tasted amazing. They also charged me $2 for ketchup which was very weird & upsetting. If you do go, know that you're also paying for the scenery."}
{"text":"After hearing about all the Drake buzz we came to check out this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was so chic and trendy and the staff was nice and friendly! There are tons of veg options and I loved their vegan sushi and the melon salad was a favorite too. Love the vibe of this place and food is great!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday and honestly, the place is super nice. I expect nothing less but luxury from Drake. I ordered the lunch nigiri/sashimi set which came with a salad. The sushi was good but honestly quite overpriced. I thought the staff was super friendly but at times could be a bit over the top. I must say the highlight of my lunch was the matcha tiramisu for dessert. It was delicious so I would highly recommend. Overall, I would love to come and try dinner here since lunch has way less options but not sure if my wallet would appreciate it."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this out as I am a drake fan. However, once the drinks came and then the food came. We agreed that we were definitely never going to come back to this place. It was our first & last time. Aside from all the hype, which was why we came in the first place, the sushi was bland and did not taste right. We had the black widow cocktail ($16) which had the Virginia black alcohol in it, the drink tasted like a watered down alcoholic charcoal detoxifying drink. The other cocktail we ordered was the passion punch ($16) because it had passion fruit in it (duh), however that one wasn't great either as it was just not very tasty. We ordered the 8 nigiris ($35) which was chefs choice. The 8 pieces came out on a huge board that was very unnecessary and looked very ugly as it was clearly evident that this plate was too big since there is more plate than food present. The rice under the nigiris tasted like regular plain white rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice (had sesame oil, etc.). The fish on top of the nigiris was even worse than the rice. It was not fresh. We were told that there was an Antonio park collab. He is a well known sushi chef in Montreal that we have yet tried, however, after this meal, I don't think I want to try lol. Next up we had the maki lobster rolls and the soft shell crab maki. Both looked presentable on plate. Both were bland, like really bland. I think water has more flavour. The only difference between water and the rolls was that water did not taste like plastic. The lobster roll was $30, and the soft shell crab roll was $18. We skipped dessert here as we were not impressed with what was served to us. We also did not finish our drinks and our sushi. It was a very disappointing experience as we expected more. We read reviews prior to going to the restaurant but thought how bad could it be. It receives 1 star for the wonderful service, our waitress was lovely & was always checking up on us. It gets another 1 star for the pretty black/gold theme decor & the music (drake music obviously). But loses 3 stars unfortunately for food & drinks."}
{"text":"Ten word summary: The food and service was good but everything was overpriced.

I had low expectations when I made reservations for this restaurant because of two things. One - restaurants usually have a lot of kinks to work out when they newly open. Two - I had a bad experience the last time I went to a restaurant associated with Drake.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon/night (my reservation was at 4:45 pm because they didn't have reservations during regular dinner time). We were greeted by a friendly staff and seated. I love the decor of the restaurant but as another reviewer mentioned, there's not enough TV and there's a glare making it hard to watch the game. 

We ordered several dishes to share: Open Face Gyoza ($16 for 3), Hot Stone Bowl ($19 - they have a typo in their description of this dish :P), BBCG ($16), Lobster Spaghetti à la Montréal Style ($39), 8-Hour Braised Kalbi Style Short Rib ($36), Snow Crab Maki ($22 for 8), and Matcha Tiramisu ($13 - not on the menu).

The open face gyoza was nice, crunchy and delicious. The hot stone bowl was so so. It's nice to order it to go with the Kalbi short rib and to make sure you're not starving at the end of the meal. My friend suggested that we order the broccoli since Drake mentioned that he likes broccoli. This dish was a pass. I wouldn't order it again. I also wish they brought it out with the Kalbi short rib and the hot stone bowl instead of with the open face gyoza. I felt like it was more of a side dish than an appetizer. 

The lobster spaghetti tasted cheap to me and not worth the $39. It's not that it tasted bad but I feel like lobster and bolognese don't really go that well together. The Kalbi short rib was very tender, flavourful and I have no complaints about the portion. The snow crab maki was good but overpriced. It was deliciously made but I'm sure I've had something similar at other restaurants for cheaper. I also would've preferred it if they brought out the maki before the spaghetti and the short rib. Since the maki has a more delicate flavour compared to the heavier dishes of spaghetti and Kalbi, I thought the progression would've been better if the maki came out first. It's just a personal preference but for the price we're paying, I feel like there needs to be closer attention to detail.

The matcha tiramisu had a nice, strong matcha taste at the top. I thought that it was a nice and interesting twist to the original tiramisu. The cream itself was mediocre. It was overly sweet and I felt like I was just eating condensed milk. I also felt that the presentation was very disappointing because it came in the same glass as our water glass.

I didn't have any issues with the food coming out late. However, there weren't that many diners in the restaurant since we ate dinner at such an odd time. I also had no issues with the staff. Yes, the food is expensive but that's expected. I would only come back here if I was around the area or if Drake decided to bring me here on a date."}
{"text":"Pick6:

Had a great experience from the moment I made reservations with all my special requests. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Lobster roll, Black Cod and Tiramisu (not on the menue) were to die for! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"came here for business lunch and was not really impressed. the food was a bit underwhelming and the price was pretty high.

the decor is okay, but there's a fine line between bling and gaudy. which way pick 6ix goes is debatable.

i didn't find the wait staff very accommodating. i probably wouldn't go again, not even on my company's dime."}
{"text":"We brought a colleague from out of town for a large lunch here, a group of 18. 

The reviews had us nervous, but in most cases, you assume people who review places on Yelp normally have bad experiences right?

Stephanie, the events coordinator was awesome to deal with in the lead up to the event. She even introduced herself once we arrived. 

The restaurant is beautiful, the staff was all very accommodating. One of my colleagues noticed a chef from Top Chef Canada working in the back, who even came out and introduced himself. Might I add, the food was, across the board, delicious. 

The only mark against the place was that it took 45 mins for our food to come. I would chalk this up to the size of the group. I would return for a fancy lunch, not an everyday spot, but definitely well suited for special occasions."}
{"text":"First thing I want to say is I really don't understand all those bad reviews. I went to Pick 6ix YESTERDAY night and it was amazing! The food, the atmosphere, the music, the service were awesome. I will detail my night at the restaurant for you to get a better understanding of my point of view. We arrive around 8pm without a reservation. The hostess told us to wait a little bit in a really kind way, then told us a high table was available in the patio. As I rather sit in regular seat to eat, we asked her if we could get another seat, she told us to ask at the main entrance so she will find us a better place. The hostess told us that it might be a little bit of wait but less than 10 minutes later, she found a place for us! It was near the dj in a good part of the restaurant. By the way, the music was nice and the place was busy. Some people might find the music loud but this is part of the atmosphere and I don't think that was a problem. A lot of Drake songs of course (I mean let's be honest you probably heard of this restaurant through Drake's communication so...) but also other artists like Migos, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Davido... Our waitress was very friendly, straight asked us if we wanted water (asking us to choose between sparkling, regular or tap water). Following that, she gave us advices about the menu and I ended up taking the crab maki (8 pieces for 25 dollars) and the Shrimp Tempura (8 pieces for about 15 dollars). My friend took the burger with fries (ketchup was included by the way, no need to pay 2$ as I previously saw in the reviews). My food was great, very tasty especially the Shrimp Tempura (I recommend!). I also ordered the Passion Cocktail, recommended by the waitress. It was good, tasty and refreshing! Again, the waitress was friendly and she was available whenever we needed her, making sure that everything was fine during the dinner! She even asked us after the dinner if we wanted to sit in the middle place so we can get a better view of the restaurant as she saw I was taking pictures. Bottom line : Great experience, tasty food, classy and very friendly staff, good music and perfect service. The only negative point might be about the prices but the food was worth it and it is not that expensive! If you want to go to a nice, chic and cool place for dinner (or lunch), go to Pick 6ix! You'll enjoy for sure :)"}
{"text":"In a city like Toronto, you can definitely find a much better and more welcoming place to eat. Food takes forever to come out, the management team treats their servers like garbage and the food is nothing to get excited over anyways. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My review is pertaining to the service, drinks and atmosphere. The atmosphere is very nice and stylish. People come dressed beautifully so dress accordingly. The bartender was very attentive and made my friend's drink just as she had requested. I was not drinking that day so ordered a virgin and it tasted amazing. Apparently my friends' alcoholic beverages were not strong at all but tasted amazing. For such a high price you would think you would get more which is a definite downside but the bartender's service was definitely commendable. I would return and recommend overall."}
{"text":"Setting all the \"Drake buzz\" aside, this place barely gets a 2 Stars rating!
The place/interior looks stunning, however, it's more of a bar/drinks' spot after work rather than an actual dine-in restaurant.

Reservation was easy via email and the website, you confirm by email and you're set.

The vibe is Loud music, 75% of customers are standing/walking around with drinks, so definitely more of a bar/lounge style.

The menu is limited, a couple of pages with no signature dishes to mention or brag about.

Prices are a little above normal, but you should be expecting that walking into the restaurant.

Service is fine, but all in all, A waste of beautiful interior and a big name, could've made something great out of it."}
{"text":"Sadly, it was exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be.
The decor is nice, kind Great Gatsby-ish like Lena. The diverse crowd was lots of hungry coworkers taking selfies and sipping cocktails. 

As for the menu, it's not available online. Definitely don't order the deep fried chicken appetizer (can't recall the name) Way too salty and tasted like something from Kelsey's. My bf ordered a beer and watched as the server struggled to poured it - she apologized saying she almost dropped the bottle because her hands are 'greasy from hand cream' 

The gyoza was sub par. We ordered what was described in the menu as tuna tartare but came out as a maki roll. Would've been nice if the server gave suggestions or more details. We also got the $38 short rib and $35 10 piece lobster roll. Both fine but grossly overpriced. The dessert menu was very limited and the server told us the flan wasn't good so we ordered coconut grenata- basically looked and tasted like freezer burnt ice chipped off and served up in a martini glass with old strawberries. Again, I was shocked when it came out... but then kind of not. 

All in all glad we checked it out, but only because we can now warn others not to go. The night finished with our server being extra friendly (with tip time approaching) she asked us about our night only to cut us off mid sentence once the transaction processed and she walked away."}
{"text":"Great interiors (minus the screens?), food was very mediocre, the sushi rolls were way over seasoned and way overpriced for the way they tasted (your neighbourhood sushi place would probably serve better rolls). Great music tho!"}
{"text":"Before reading any further, keep in mind that I visited Pick 6ix on a Saturday night for drinks so this review is solely of that. 

We decided to check out Pick 6ix for drinks after it came highly recommended to me by a friend. Of course, it was prefaced with... \"it's Drake's new place!\" so I immediately knew I had to check it out. I'm so glad we did because it made for a memorable night in Toronto!

Pick 6ix is trendy, modern, and upscale. It's a gorgeous spot that is very tastefully decorated. This place feels like something straight out of the Great Gatsby. The gold and black color scheme just screams elegance. They certainly paid attention to detail when decorating this place.The bar area featured small LED mirrored TVs in the wall. The chairs had a plush velvet feel to them. I was seriously swooning over the gorgeous gold ceiling light fixtures. There was plenty of seating including small high top tables , curved booths, larger group tables, and bar seating. So, whether you're looking to celebrate a big birthday, have a private party, or enjoy an intimate date night, I'd say Pick 6ix could be an option for you. There was a DJ spinning all night; of course, expect to hear plenty of Drake. To sum it up - it's all about the vibes. You definitely want to be seen and pictured here. Make sure your phone is charged because its totally Instagram worthy.

Service was pretty good. The bartenders were all extremely nice, knowledgeable, and friendly. They gave great recommendations when asked.

The drinks speak for themselves. I tried a glass of sauvigon blanc and the  akan sour. It was amazing... so good that I ended up getting a second! Perfect mix of sweet and sour. In terms of price, cocktails range from about $13-18. Pretty much what you'd expect for a place of this caliber. 

Based on Pick 6ix's reviews, it seems this place is definitely better for drinks. I would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the drinks here are amazing. They served some of the best super fancy drinks with gold flakes I've seen. I would come back for the drinks I don't recommend getting the food here.
On a side note I'm kind of surprised they didn't play any drake songs when we went.. lots and lots of Neyo though.."}
{"text":"I came here to have dinner with my hubby for his bday. Service was great but the food was just okay. The braised kalbi we ordered was so salty but the soft shell crab roll was good. 

Pros:
Good service 
Nice ambiance
Comfy velvety couch/lounge

Cons:
Overpriced food for the quality you get"}
{"text":"All of our food literally came out one plate at a time a few minutes apart. One of our meals didn't come at all until we asked a manager, who then went into the back to get the salmon which was clearly rushed and crispy on the outside. Upon cutting into the salmon it was raw on the inside. 

The meals that did come were very average. The chicken extremely over cooked and dry. The spicy salmon roll was good but over all this is one of the worst experiences and tasting meals I have had in the \"6ix\". 

So ya... if you like over priced, under cooked food then this is your spot. If you want to be really underwhelmed order the $45 salmon. But hey it's Drake's restaurant."}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice but is it a sports bar, fine dining or upscale casual? The TVs had a glare on them so we could barely watch the game. The menu is over priced ($45 for cod/salmon) and they had sold out of a few dishes we wanted to try. Service was shaky as we ordered an appetizer that never arrived. One friends drink never showed up and I walked out spending $90 for a main and 2 vodka waters and I was still hungry! Food took a long time to arrive too, which the Bay Street lunch crowd won't be okay with. Pick 6 has a few things to figure out before I go back."}
{"text":"Honestly surprised with all of the bad reviews. I loved it. The service was awesome and the food was tasty.  We ordered the asian salad, chicken ssam lettuce cups, a sausage bun, snow crab maki and 30 pieces of sashimi.  I had their daily cocktail, which had watermelon, ketel one, mint - really refreshing.  Was also nice to watch the Raptors game there.  The space was nice too!"}
{"text":"I'm assuming the 42 people below this review have been sucking on a \"Lemon\" (the remix) and were on their \"Worst Behavior\" when writing their own reviews. I couldn't have had a better time at Pick 6ix this evening, it was far and away \"The Best I Ever Had\". I could have enjoyed the seaweed salad \"Forever\". Our server, Esther, had incredible \"Energy\" and \"Started From The Bottom\" of the menu and recommended her favorites as well as highlighted the many vegan choices one of the members of our dinner party required. There was no \"Fake Love\" for the cocktail menu and I \"Took Care\" to have more than one glass of the beautiful sauv blanc. I kept \"Sneaking\" sips of my husbands beer while he ordered \"Back to Back\" snow crab rolls. I absolutely recommend that you \"Find Your Love\" and visit Pick 6ix. Don't have \"Trust Issues\" from these other reviewers - this place will have you yelling \"HYFR\" Pick 6ix is doing it right not \"Doing it Wrong\"."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but somehow everything fell short. 

Probably 5 days after we made our reservation they announced that it would be \"Drake Night\" however nothing was communicated to us once the announcement was made. On the Monday (we went on the 24th) I received a call confirming my reservation. 

Once we arrived at the restaurant we were walked though the whole place just so the hostess could get to another host stand, pick up menus then walk us back through the dining room to our table. Our server (Who was actually really sweet and attentive) proceeded to tell us that they only had 3/6 cocktails and about 4 popular menu items unavailable. Once we finished our first round of drinks we wanted to order a bottle of prosecco, but again, they had run out. 

For Food we ordered the open faced gyoza, softshell crab maki, Lobster maki, Shrimp Tempura maki and the short rib. For dessert we had an off menu match tiramisu. Food was mediocre, Dessert was good. 

Around 8 we decided to order another plate, it was at that time that our server asked us if we were told what time we had to leave....yes we were given a time that we had to leave due to the restaurant hosting \"drake night\" and essentially turning into a club. We were not told this in advance, or at the door, or when sitting down for our meal. At 845 a server started walking around handing out dessert menu's to all the tables, basically saying \"time to go\"....tasteless.

You are paying for the name and Drake's brand. That's what I expected for the food prices weren't surprising to me.

Finally, on our way out we decided to use the bathroom. There as a massive pool of water coming out the door which was not marked. we turned around and the \"wet floor\" sign was facing the wrong direction, not visible to somone not looking for it. A man, likely contractor, was standing outside the door saying \"LADIES MOVE\", not even apologizing or saying that there was another bathroom we could use. The hostesses were standing there staring around but not directing us or anyone else. 

Would I come back? No, this was a one and done."}
{"text":"Clean place you get greeted at the door this time I went to the bar. Person at the bar seemed disoriented asked for a Canadian he grabbed the glass and then realized that they don't serve Canadian. Very slow service bar tenders take their sweet time I sat at the bar for 15 min before asked if i wanted a drink. 

I'm into music business I produced for Drake and many artists so this an honest review. Ton of posers and clout chasers male and female people walking around flexing prolly not a place to take your family kids grandma etc. 


Atmosphere is very nice younger crowd it's good place to go on a date or just chill and watch Raptors 


FYI place is not cheap so bring $ considering it's clout chasing season and can't be ballin on budget."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great, our server Ravina was terrific and made our first visit amazing...helped recommend the best dishes and cocktails and made sure we were comfortable throughout the several hours we were there ...even long after we had finished desert."}
{"text":"The ambience at this restaurant is probably the only thing that I like.  Ive had much better food, especially sushi at other restaurants in Toronto.  I would never come back."}
