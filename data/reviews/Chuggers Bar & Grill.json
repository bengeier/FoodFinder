{"text":"Staff doesn't address new customers sitting at tables, food was cold and the wait was long, they didn't have the food we ordered and didn't tell us until after they served the other food, and worst of all it was over priced.  This isn't the first time we have had issues like this so needless to say we won't be back and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"If you go here make sure you take your checkbook and credit cards as they have the most expensive drinks I have ever had. I had to pay $4.75 for a shot of Cuervo tequila. which I can get anywhere else for $3.50.i"}
{"text":"First time here. Service was good. Food was very good. The band was awesome. Prices are reasonable. Had a great time with friends & family"}
{"text":"We came to Chuggers tonight for a going away party for my husband's coworker. We just had drinks...Moscato for me, Guinness for my husband. It wasn't hard to get a drink at the bar. Table service was non-existant though. When it came time to leave I waited at one location at the bar for 10 minutes. The guys next to me were served and I even made eye contact with 2 different bartenders. Eventually I moved to another location and it took two guys directing the bartender to me to get someone to get me my check. Providing poor customer service at the point when someone decides how much to tip is not a wise choice..."}
{"text":"Neighborhood pub, packed on a Saturday night, serious pool players. Music is good. Didn't try food. Prices look good. No table service.  Parking is easy."}
{"text":"I drive a commercial truck and chose this place based on their Google rating and large parking lot. I called ahead from outside of Toledo to see if they have Yuengling on draft, and if indeed, as I read online, that their kitchen was open until 10:00. I was assured of both. 

Arrived at 9:05 and am told it is fryer foods only.  Why? Slow night so lazy cook is wanting to go home and closed the kitchen early!!! Closing early is DEATH to a business!  Probably why they were so slow.  

Also, they were out of Yuengling on draft! D'oh!

I left and found a much better place not a 1/4 mile away where they HAD Yuengling and their kitchen was OPEN."}
{"text":"Dear Diary,

I love you each time we meet. Your staff is always happy to see me and feed my soul. How I love you..let me count thy ways. Outsiders: don't hate, you will feel welcomed. Food will satisfy belly and soul."}
{"text":"Tuesday night is 4 tacos for $2 tonight the tacos are good and well worth every penny happy hours phenomenal the staff is very sociable efficient and attentive"}
{"text":"My wife and I stop here for lunch several times a year. It is clearly a locals bar located in a failed shopping center. When you first get there you wonder if you should go in however I urge you to. The place isn't fancy: high top tables or the bar are your seating choices. There is a good choice in beer, including some craft beers. The food menu is limited to bar food: burgers, sandwiches, wings and appetizers. Service has always been good and the food is tasty. To me the quantity of food is reasonable (designed for a normal adult, not a football player LOL). Yesterday I had the philly cheese steak and fries. The sandwich was on a 6 inch bun and the fries were limited to a reasonable portion. Not the 4 person serving you get at other places. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat in Streetsboro and don't want one of the many fast-food or chain restaurants, this place fills the bill."}
{"text":"It was a nice bar with a great mix of people. Food was good, only had some appetizers."}
{"text":"Really clean. Good beer selection. Friendly locals and staff. Food was really good!  Live music, sports, nice pool tables, etc. really good local bar. We were just traveling through and it was a great choice to stop into."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.  I've never had bad service here and the place is always clean and neat.  Best time for lunch is Tuesday!  TACO TUESDAY!  4 tacos for $2.  Yep!  Hubby and I each get tacos and share an appetizer and then finish off our lunch with a game or 2 of billiards!   Fantastic prices, wonderful service."}
{"text":"Best place in the area for live music, tons of taps, pool, games and a down to earth crowd. It's a local bar you can really enjoy and hangout with the crowd. Amazing lunch food specials bring a reason to day drink. If you are in town for business, this is a must go, great evening entertainment most nights."}
{"text":"Thought Chuggers might be a dive bar, but was pleasantly surprised with everything!  Thursday at 5:30 the patrons had every high top table filled but two. The waitresses were very attentive. The DJ was working the 70-80s music and a dance ball was sparkling. I asked our \"main\" waitress if the place was always so busy. She said that Thursday is Wings night, and is busy. Our Groupon provided us with a lot of food, and it was all delicious. The large fried mushrooms are breaded and fried on the spot, the best I've ever had. The potato skins are cut wedges served with sour cream. The house salad was deluxe. The two kinds of pizza were delicious. The crust was not too heavy, and lots of cheese. The toppings so good. Best of all was the outdoor smoking patio. Everyone was happy. Good vibes. Thus Groupon was a winner. We'll be back, hopefully to dance."}
{"text":"Son and I stopped in here because we found on groupon. We figured it was a dive bar. However we were pleasantly surprised by the service and food. Makayla our server was fantastic, and very attentive for how busy it was. The food is surprisingly good for bar food. My son and I will definitely be back!! Might have to bring my husband next time due to the wall of beer selections they have (Cant forget about the food). Keep up the good Work/Service chuggers!! You've earned a fan for life."}
{"text":"Yet another trip on over to streetsboro so gave Chuggers a try. Shopping center alone looked really outdated but that doesnt mean much. Upon entering the door, the smell of raw sewage hits you but the smell of good cooking food minglings with it...if thats possible. We decide to sit at the bar as it was pretty empty and there were only two of us. Bartender greeted us, did the usual drink order and menu giving. Told us the specials then was called back behind into kitchen area. Not sure if this poor bartender murdered someones  small children but she was getting hollered  at like she participated in some unthinkable crime.  Screamed at! The lady screaming at her was asking questions but kept screaming so the poor girl couldnt answer her. Swearing and talking all ghetto/ uneducated at her employee not caring who is listening. And trust me all 6 of us at the bar had no choice to listen. Bartender finally emerged from the back, face red, eyes watery, but continues to do her job with no explanation as to why she was just degraded to pieces. I give her props for that. Drinks are good, music is good but no matter how much i try to brighten the day of this poor scorned bullied girl she just slaps on a face smile and does busy work. Food is good but we didnt get one of our sides. Im too petrified to ask the bartender cause i dont want her boss to overhear so i ignore it. Finally she remembers it and grabs me a ranch. She moves on to two new customers. From behind me as we are eating i hear that awful annoying sound of the boss or manager whoever she is complaining about her workers. Shes not being even close to quiet. Im hearing they are lazy , rob from her, they are all unintelligent oh and they love drama. ( pretty funny coming from her). She insists their houses must be disgusting because they dont ever clean her bar. Cant say i would do much for her either. The African American man shes spewing off her ugliness at looks half interested or hes heard it all before as he barely looks up from his phone.  Food good. Drinks good. Place smelled but appeared clean. Prices very reasonable. I want to come back for their band saturday ill just avoid the big beastly nasty screaming manager/ boss!"}
{"text":"great Gyro salad platter, the bartender will make any drink you ask for, and the Karaoke night is as good as it gets! Order the monkey balls! Deep-fried deliciousness. Pool tables, full bar and great staff"}
