{"text":"I always hesitated to come in here because I thought all they served was just sandwiches and salads. I was so wrong.   They have really good wraps (like chicken club with mango guac) and some sandwiches that could give the Queen St stores a run for their money. Also every day they have hot specials like perogies.   There is limited seating, and gets crowded around lunch time. I sat there to eat my wrap, but my clothes smelled like food afterwards.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good pit stop for a quick bite to eat. They have specials everyday but Friday, and are usually a good value. I like the chicken club wrap with guacamole. Not great coffee... But good enough when you need one."}
{"text":"breakfast burrito salsa wrap. Breakfast Burrito Salsa Wrap. BREAKFAST BURRITO SALSA WRAP.  A WHOLE BUNCH OF EXCLAMATION MARKS.  ahem.  i think that's clear.  yes indeed, first break makes an excellent--well you get it.  this place sits in an industrial building on carlaw avenue between dundas and queen on the west side and im pretty sure it is family owned.  the son runs it now.  it has its local regulars and rightly so.  from the son and father owner team it seems the son is the gregarious one (is it too pretentious a word for a coffee shop?), basically emanating the universal maxim \"it's all good dude\".    they have a little bar facing the window where perhaps 3 or 4 people can fit.  Its more of a take out place.  and on that note, in addition to the...you can get a hearty egg, toast, hash brown and 6 piece bacon breakie, other great little subs, sandwiches, and there are specials too.  there are good drinks too.  (for me that means real oj like tropicana).  if its nice out try to snap a seat on the metal coffee cup bench.  (what the hell you say? - on your break go to first break.)"}
{"text":"Great for food on the fly - simple \"hit the spot\" breakfast burritos with salsa, cheese and eggs, taco Thursdays, healthy salads and good coffee.   The only downfall - cash only. Luckily I go there enough to get a tab!"}
