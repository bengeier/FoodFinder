{"text":"The wall art outside had me fooled. It said 5000 ans, but inside it's  C'est si bon. My friend and I waited for 10 minute before anyone acknowledged us. After we were seated, we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to come take our orders. We then had to ask for water. Service was slow, waited about 40 minutes for food. Food itself was not bad. The kimchi Jigae 5/10, the japchae noodles =7/10, then again you can't really screw up japchae. The side dish that all korean restos give was nasty. The potatoes tasted like frozen cut potatoes deep fried again. Not at all like the korean sweet potatoes usually given. The pickled cucumber was limp and tasted super old . The radish was fine.  The interior looks like an old Italian restaurant. I asked for a water refill which never came. Ended up paying up front because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for the waiters to come by. They had to ask where we sat.  Suffice to say, yea. no thanks."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. The service was great.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The food was amazing.  We had Soondubu (spicy tofu soup), bibimbap, kimchi pajeon (kimchi green onion pancake with pork), mandu (dumplings) and kimchi.  The food tasted fresh, well prepared and cooked to perfection.  We literally couldn't stop eating.  I have lived in Korea and I can attest to the quality of the food at this restaurant.  The atmosphere was also very nice, it was intimate and romantic.  It is perfect for couples and dates."}
{"text":"Alright folks I liked this place but I have just not stumbled upon korean food that I adore. I really thought they did a decent job of what was brought to our table but overall I thought it was just moyen."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CORÉEN tout près de la station de métro Sherbrook, le bibimbap est délicieux ainsi que le barbecue pour 2, le service est toujours impeccable et le décor est chaleureux avec des sculptures plutôt suggestives ayez l'il ;)"}
{"text":"To clarify my one star rating: the food we did get was 3-4 stars, but the service/wait was the single worst experience I've ever had in my life.   The (new) waiter we had was probably fired already, but I think blame lies on the management for hiring someone so incompetent and then clearly not providing him with adequate training.   Problems: I had to find our waiter and ask him to come take our order. We ordered drinks which were not started on until we asked about them (we know this because our waiter came back to our table right after we asked about them to tell us that one was not available). The kicker, however,  was that my main, which was the Budae Jjigae, never came because our waiter didn't put the order in. Ironically and sadly, yes, I ordered a soup for two because I was starving; I hadn't eaten since the morning. I even made it a point of conversation with the waiter at the time I ordered it assuring him that I really did want a meal for two because I was so hungry. Five minutes after my friends meals arrived (which in itself was after a very long wait), I asked our harried waiter if mine was coming out and I was assured that it was. Well, guess what, 10 minutes AFTER THAT, he came back to our table and told us that he never put in my soup. So at that point I left and got a pizza, leaving my friends to finish up.  Their drinks were comp'd but after that fiasco, I think the whole meal should have been free."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since it opened. It's clear that they use the same marinated meats for various dishes, which clashes when you have the tofu stew (a spicy and savoury dish) with the same beef that had meat (sweetly) marinated for  bulgogi. Despite this, the pajeon is amazing and the yukhwe (Korean beef tartare) are a must try."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place, because I love Korean food so much and it's quite close to home.  On this particular day I was having an extreme bibimbap craving.  It was decent, but not memorable.  We also ordered some Kimchi (which my boyfriend hates paying for as many places offer it for free) and it was also was not very memorable."}
{"text":"Still open but rubbish lunch.  poor quality noodle soup with frozen seafood."}
{"text":"Single-handedly the worst Korean restaurant I've been to in Montreal.  Not only are the same dishes priced up to 50% more expensive than their competitors', but they just taste significantly worse. In fact, none of our dishes tasted like they should; my soup (yookgejang) was too bland - think soup-scented hot water. That alone would have been a two-star dish. Meanwhile, the soup my friend ordered (soondubu) tasted like the chef mistook sugar for salt; waaay too sweet and not at all salty for a soup of its kind. It wasn't any different when they took it into the kitchen again and brought out another one. Not having touched the food after the first spoonful, my friend demanded a refund, but it seemed like they were preparing the same dish in the kitchen to bring out for the third time.  And to the chef(?) who came out of the kitchen to stare at us as we were paying up: yes, we saw you swear under your breath."}
{"text":"The original address closed, now it's located at C'est si bon just lower down on St-Denis. We were 3 and we had the mixed kimchis, beef mandus, beef tartare, haemul pajeon, beef japchae and kimchi jiggae. Everything was totally on-point. Montreal doesn't have so many good Korean restaurants and this was by far the best we had. The kimchi also had the nicest presentation. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bad bad restaurant. We ordered Yukhoe, the beef was frozen. We complained, the waitress insisted on telling us it was supposed to be eaten like that, she made us pay for it. Rest of the food was not that great and rather expensive. Really don't suggest to go to this one, Montreal has so many better Korean restos..."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place for the food and friendly service. I went 2 times recently, the food is still great. Get the Mandu (Dumplings) and kimchi for entrées, they are amazing. Also the Udon and Bibimbap are on par., very tasty! The waiters do not seem to be organised and run in the restaurant. One of them tripped on my friend. We waited 30 minutes for our entrées and 1 hour for our food. We had to go get our water ourselves and our waiter seemed bothered with our requests (Water, an extra plate to share, soy sauce, hot sauce that were not on our table). Please get yourself back together 5000 ans."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this cute little restaurant and I really liked it! We ordered a dish for two and it was a small BBQ with bibimbap. It was very good and flavorful. The service was alright and the prices were really good. They had a large variety of dishes on their menu and it all looked so good :) I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in Montreal to eat bibimbap. The service is always very friendly and there's always a place for you. Perfect in winter for a warm cozy place, the ambiance is very peaceful, the staff is always smiling. And the food!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant coréen vraiment bon, une déco subtile et originale. Et une présentation des plats vraiment jolie. J'ai décidé d'y aller car des amis en faisaient sans cesse des éloges. J'y suis donc allé avec une amie.  On est arrivé, et on est venu s'occuper de nous tout de suite. La dame ne parlais pas français, et pas très bien l'anglais. Nous avons commandé un mélange d'un peu tout pour goûter un maximum de choses ( habitude que l'on a avec mon amie). Pour boire on devait bien attendre à chaque fois pour avoir de l'eau car la personne ne nous voyait pas, et ce fut pareil pour la facture.   Arrivé au moment de payer, on laisse un Tips en fonction de ce qu'on a trouver correct dans le service ... devinez quoi? c'était pas assez ... un minimum était requis ... d'où? Nous travaillons tout deux dans la restauration et avons jugé que le service valait ce tip. Le tip minimum n'existe pas, il est conseillé pas obligatoire, et ils n'ont pas le droit de nous obliger à donner plus. Donc nous sommes partis.  Après je sais que la personne s'occupant habituellement de la salle était en vacance, car mes amis était surpris d'apprendre ce qu'il s'était passé.  Donc je met un note moyenne à cause de ce problème qu'il y a eu .."}
{"text":"J'écris cette revue plusieurs mois après être allée au resto. Nous nous rappelons que c'était bon mais pas moyen de se souvenir de ce que nous y avons mangé J'en déduis que ce n'était rien de transcendant. À mon avis pas besoin de faire le détour juste pour lui mais sympa si on passe dans le quartier"}
{"text":"BBQ coréen: très bon...la viande un peu trop salée. Bibimbap: excellent!  Crêpe coréenne: bien...quoique je n'ai jamais éte une grande fan.  Service: interminable! Malheureusement! Nous avons dû appeler les serveurs a plusieurs reprises. Dommage!"}
{"text":"I loooove korean  food so I have nothing to complain about no that regard. The thing is, there are so many korean restaurants nowadays   that the atmosphere changes the whole review process. Also, even if the food is good, it has nothing special compared to all the other places."}
{"text":"Je reviens tout juste du restaurant après un souper avec une amie. Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais manger coréen, mais je n'en avais jamais eu l'occasion avant. Nous sommes entrées et nous étions étonnées par la décoration très jolie, on ne s'y attend pas quand on le voit de l'extérieur. Quelqu'un s'est très vite occupé de nous, et le serveur a pu nous conseiller en fonction de nos goûts (mon amie étant végétarienne). En entrée nous avons partagé des Madu (dumpling) et des Ttokbokki épicés puis ensuite en plat un Japchae et un bol Bibimbap. Tout le repas était très bon et les portions copieuses. J'ai vraiment eu un coup de cur pour le Japchae qui sont des nouilles de patate douces avec des légumes. Les serveurs venaient souvent nous remplir nos verres d'eau et nous demander si tout était à notre goût, et ce, malgré le groupe de 30 touristes dans la salle en même temps que nous."}
{"text":"The food here was decent, the prices standard. I tried the Korean stew with beef, the Bulgogi BBQ for two and the seafood pancake- all good but not a standout. The server was kind of awkward and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him when asking for drinks. My friends appetizer came out basically at the end of the meal. The beers were v cheap though."}
{"text":"Walked really far to come here because we thought it was another place. It wasn't. Food was ok and the beer was cheap so I'd give this place a solid \"meh\" out of 10."}
{"text":"I prefer the 5000 ans on St-Catherine because they offer better portions and quality. Yet the ambiance at 5000 ans on St-Denis is better because the light is brighter and the decor nicer. The food is decent but not out of the world"}
{"text":"This is a cute Korean restaurant that it´s not too hard on the budget and serves delicious Korean cuisine. The atmosphere and decor are nice and the service is friendly. While you´re waiting for your order, you get to enjoy nicely presented banchan (complimentary small dishes of food served before the main meal), which in our case included great kkakdugi (radish kimchi) along with other 2 yammy dishes.  A little tip, you may want to book a table if you're planning to go there on Friday or Saturday because it can get busy."}
{"text":"So I'm giving this place 4 stars because it wouldn't be fair to give 3 stars, but really in my opinion it deserves 3,5 stars. First it's  the kind of place that will offer what you pay for: you can't be disappointed. Second the food is good; you can't deny it. But as far as the experience go it's not a place I will remember. We had the sea food Korean crepe as a first meal, which was excellent. We took the BBQ beef. That comes with a miso soup: very blend like most miso soup, a salad: I have to say it was a good salad not drowning under a thick dressing, a bibimbap: tasty and fun and finally the BBQ beef: the meat was well marinated and tender but I have to say they could be more generous on the veggies side.Yes, it's a lot of food, thanks to my pregnant friend. The thing is everything got to us at the same time. I felt I was in rush to eat all of this...plus the waitress grill the meat for us ( I prefer those place where I'm in charge of grilling my meat, control freak I know) so we weren't done with the entree that she was already grilling the meat. I didn't feel I could sit and enjoy the meal. Obviously it would be a plus if we were on a rush but we weren't. Other than that the service was good, both waitress didn't speak a good French nor English but they really did try which is much appreciated. I was also surprised by the house wine at 5$ for a glass, I can't recall the name but it came from France, for the price it wasn't bad at all. So overall I'd go back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Love this place! A good variety of Korean meals at reasonable prices. Also loved the fact that it's cozy and intimate. Their bibimbap and their tofu beef stew are the best. Very friendly services as well. Always packed on weekends when I go there."}
