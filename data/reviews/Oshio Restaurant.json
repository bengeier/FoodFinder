{"text":"Neat Japanese restaurant. No reservations needed.
Order a boat sushi if you have more than 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"Steadily going downhill. When they first opened, the food was pretty good and quite a decent value. Over the years, the portions are getting smaller, the food less tasty, and the service has stayed the same (terrible). They need to get there act together. I used to go at least once a month, now I'm not sure I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Easily the best Sushi in Toronto. Always fresh, fast, friendly, and delicious. Miso soup is always spot on. Salty, but subdued. Everything is always available and tastes great! My favourite sushi place.

Basically, the owners are a quaint woman and her son. The son talks to us a lot at the table and shares his sushi experiences. A really charismatic guy that knows how to treat good customers. 

The teriyaki sauce is brewed for 7-8 hours every day. The chicken teriyaki is absolutely delicious, and the sauce is perfect. I would definitely recommend it in the bento box. Everything, the rice, sprouts, noodles, is steaming hot, delicious, and super fresh. 

Every roll is tightly wrapped, and plentiful with good ingredients. They have an excellent menu, but it's not TOO huge. A good size that offers variety and good flavour profiles. 

The rolls span from cucumber to Oshio House Special rolls. My favourite roll is the Oshio Special. I would definitely recommend it, and the rolls are large and very full. I can usually eat 1 and a half rolls, or 12-14 pieces. 

The ambience is nice, clean, and tastefully lit. The sushi can also be seen as it's made at a small sushi bar with about 4 seats. 

They use fresh Kikkoman soy sauce, and amazing wasabi and ginger. Delicious! 

The seating area is not usually full. Kind of empty actually, but the reason for that is due to their take out options. Usually, people take out to eat at home as opposed to stay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Delicious sushi."}
{"text":"It was empty when I went in during a weekday.
I ordered takeout and the preparation time was quick. Food was surprisingly good for takeout.

I was staying in the area so this was super convenient.  Did not accept my corporate AMEX however.
Will be back"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go with the wife and kiddie once or twice a week. We have been there 31 times this year! (As of mid-may... I counted my receipts). The all day box is actually quite good and very reasonably priced. The other stuff including the rolls & japchae is really good too. I remember my first visit, the service was exquisite! I gotta start going more often. If you are there, dont take the back left table beside the booth - Its MINE!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food, ordered take-out sushi and sashimi boat, rice was very dry and cold. Not recommend."}
{"text":"I like the Japanese style room. For an average Japanese restaurant, this is a good choice. Service is good too. Will try again."}
{"text":"Seldom do I go or eat at the Shops on 404 and Steeles.  It is a typical local Japanese restaurant with Japanese look but no fancy d√©cor.

The Lunch Special has a very good price comparable to those food courts in downtown.   The portion is decent and the sashimi and sushi are fresh.  Not to mention is its sushi once picked up split into halves and the sushi rice is a bit hard.

Not too much expectation and is ok for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"I was extremely displeased to be disregarded over and over again by the same young lady who works there. I waved for her attention, we locked eyes and she nodded but walked away. Another 3 minutes later, she emerged from the kitchen with another customers order. As she was walking back to the kitchen, I waved for her attention again and she looked at me and said, \"what?\" She walked over (unwillingly) and I asked her politely to take my order as I needed to head for work. She said she doesnt take orders but she'll send someone over (the older lady). The younger lady walked RIGHT passed the older lady and didnt mention a word. 

After another 5 long minutes of constantly trying to place my order, I signalled for the young lady once again (because the older lady spent most of her time with her head down or in the kitchen), and I asked for my order to be taken immediately as this is becoming ridiculous. The young lady nodded and whispered something to the older lady. The older lady took her time at the cash register, then brought an order to a customer from the kitchen before taking an order from ANOTHER customer. At this point, if she took my order I'd understand as the restaurant was semi busy. The older lady simply walked back to the kitchen after taking the customers additional order.

This lead me to believe that either the young lady was purposely disregarding me, or both the lady's were incompetent. Throughout the entire process of approximately 15 minutes of desperately trying to place my order, I had been disregarded several times in a row. By the time I had decided that I will miss my lunch before work by leaving the restaurant, I had not even received my TEA yet. I will NEVER return NOR RECOMMEND this restaurant to anyone I know or care about. What a shame it was to drive all the way out to Oshio for such an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"One of the most painful dining experiences in quite a while.

Why? Service. It's nonexistent. The staff are too busy. In fact during my stay I cringed every time a person would walk in for takeout or dine in because I knew from observing that they won't be helped for at least 5-10min at a time AND it would add even more wait time to our order.

The food however when it did finally arrive tasted very good! So I salute the Korean sushi chef ... he didnt drop the ball in this regard. :) we ordered 3 maki rolls to share - spicy tuna, spicy salmon, dynamite roll(shrimp tempura). . They were prepared with care with the sushi rice and sesame seeds on the outside 

This would be at best a call in advance take out establishment. As of right now I cannot recommend dining in because the restaurant is understaffed and results in extremely long wait times when dining in."}
{"text":"HIDDEN FEE - Honesty is NOT their best policy.
No spoken or properly menu printed statement saying there is an extra charge of $3.00 per person at lunch time ON TOP of the cost of the menu item on the weekend.
That's correct: any menu item you pick, another $3 bucks is added before tax, and they do not tell you this to your face. Instead, they sneak in the extra charge in tiny pen-written form in your bill at the end of the meal.

Eat here if you enjoy sticky tables, hidden fees, inaccurate menu prices, and dishonest business owners."}
{"text":"For $13.99 plus tax, I'm not complaining. I got the lunch special deal, there were 10 pcs of sushi, 6pcs of California maki, a mini bowl of congee, salad, miso soup and green tea. It's nothing too extraordinary but at least food was genuinely and decently made. It's not something I'd crave for but I'd definitely come back if I was around the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!

Beautifully presented sushi, fantastic service! A true hidden gem"}
{"text":"Sashimi lunch bento was very good for the price, and came with a lot of food as well. The fish was fresh, the miso soup, salad, and japchae were all delicious, and the congee was definitely a nice surprise. The 3 star rating is for the absolute lack of service we received. We had to flag down several waiters before one came along that would take our orders. The tea was NEVER refilled. Getting the bill was quite a hassle as well. The only positive was that we weren't rushed, but then, the place wasn't even that busy! Come to this place for some cheap food, but don't expect any sort of top dining experience."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is only \"okay\" as the quality is average and the price is pretty much...regular (i.e. not cheap).

As mentioned by other Yelpers, I would go with their maki combo sets - they were pretty tasty. Their \"all day bento box\" was quite disappointing - sashimi/sushi thin as paper and not high quality. No rice is given, it was loaded with bean sprouts everywhere (and it happens that I hate bean sprouts). Gyoza were typical frozen but fried again stuff. The only saving grace was the japchae, which was in a small portion. Bento box with a sushi pizza and ice cream, but really, nothing special since the whole bento was so lacklustre.

If you go to this restaurant, only 2 things you should order: Maki and japchae. 

Conclusion: Only go if you're desperate for maki rolls, otherwise, venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"A friend brought a platter to my house for lunch...it was the BEST sushi I have ever had!!!  So fresh and tasty!!  A great selection!!   Will defiantly order from them !!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I used to live closer. After not having come here for ages, I just got takeout from here just now as I was shopping at the food basics nearby. Ordered 11 pieces of nigiri sushi + 6 pieces shrimp tempura roll, with soup and salad for about $16 and change.

Quality of the nigiri sushi was decent, but not great in terms of variety. 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of white tuna, 4 pieces of salmon, and 3 pieces of red snapper. The size of them were also pretty small.

As I'm having the last piece of the take out, the tuna sushi tasted a bit off...

6/10 for quality. 6/10 for value. 6/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Got the bulgogi bento lunch special for $8.99
Owner gave me a complimentary congee, the jap chae is delicious and so is the the beef. The miso soup and salad were good too. Like everyone else is saying, it's quiet during lunchtime but I noticed a lot of take out orders. 
Will try the sushi next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to. Whenever I am in the neighbourhood, I go there for lunch and I would rate this place much better than Katsura (westin prince) which I was told is the best for Japanese. The veg and shrimp tempura here is to die for, absolutely fresh and crisp and perfectly seasoned and fried. I always order the teriyaki salmon lunch special which is I believe L11 on the menu. Absolutely a must visit place if you like Japanese bento box! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gave them a few chance every time I order, they charge a different price than what's on the take out menu. I asked them for a updated menu and they don't have one. So they can just raise the price when you pick up your take out. Spicy salmon is very oily, and generally their sashimi and sushi are not very fresh."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month since my girlfriend likes it, but I would probably never go to this place if it weren't for her. 

This is cute and quaint little place and has decent sushi with good service, but everything else seems of lower quality.  Don't get me wrong, I love sushi, but there are better places. Their maki rolls are great, but I have found fresher sashimi elsewhere.  

Best part about this place: cute, quaint and their maki. Price is also cheap for the volume of food they give you, but their free appetizers are mediocre at best.

Worst part: everything else on the menu is not good - kalbi, udon noodles, bimibap all not good. 

If you are in the mood for maki, go here and you'll be happy. If you are in the mood for a mixed meal in terms of quality sashimi and other Japanese food, then there are plenty of other places in Richmond Hill and Markham that are much better."}
{"text":"It was decent sushi. Probably a bit pricey for the standard, as it seemed like sushi you would get at sushi bong. But it was filling."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a few weeks ago since I've passed by it on the way go Wimpy's Diner.  Out of all days I decided to come here when we had a winter storm.  
However the cozy, quiet ambiance with hints of Japanese decor makes you feel at home. Unlike Wimpy's Diner, this restaurant does NOT have a mall entrance, but rather you have to walk outside to enter. 
The service is pretty good and they've got an extensive selection whether here for lunch or dinner.  
For food I decided to try their Oshio Special Roll, which to my surprise came wrapped in a pink soyabean sheet; inside filled with shrimp tempura, BBQ eel, avocado, cucumber.  Overall the presentation was great, however found it had too much rice.  Each ingredient in this roll complimented one another. Overall of this dish was a 3.5/5. 

Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"While the restaurant is very modern and clean, and the prices affordable - the fish wasn't very good.  I paid around $25 and ordered from their huge \"all you can eat\" menu.  I had lots of sashimi, tempura, a couple rolls and a couple cooked items but none of the fish tasted fresh.  It was \"ok\".  The service was good.  Looks like a good place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"I used to work here maybe 8 years ago when I was in highschool.  I recently tried this place as I was in the area but can't recommend this place.  

The place was empty and we ordered the chicken cutlet and fried udon to go, we could hear the employees being unsure of what goes in the takeout box, which didn't really inspire confidence in the place.

As for the taste, it was nothing special; eatable but not enough to make me wantto come back for more.

Wouldn't recommend this place unless you were in the neighborhood and really want to eat japanese/korean and can't go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Compare to other sushi restaurants, this place is not very impressive, and nothing special from the limited menu, that's why I rate it with 3 stars.. However the waiter is quite friendly, and I really like the atmosphere - quiet, relaxing, casual and no rushing... It's a good place for those who look for a cafe style restaurant.. 
In terms of food, the black dragon sushi roll and tempuras were pretty good, however i wasn't really satisfied with the desert - tempura ice cream.. The crispy coating was simply too sugary, we ended up not finishing it although it's a really small size of serving.."}
{"text":"We got sat down and took 30 minutes before someone came to take our orders after waving down the same younger lady multiple times, and having the older lady just ignore us. WE KNOW YOU SEE US."}
{"text":"We came here as a family last year after a road trip from Ottawa. While we often stop at this plaza for Congee Queen, we came here when the line over there was much too long. It was Sunday night and we were starving from a few hours on the road.

The restaurant was separated into main dining area as well as small tatami rooms (with leg room for those of us who like to stretch our legs). Service was mediocre and polite.

In terms of the food, everything just seemed a bit off. There wasn't anything particularly good about the vegetable tempura or the rolls; we ordered pancake as well but didn't realize that it would come with seafood. Since my sister and I are vegetarian, I ended up getting the rest of our family on it.

Maybe it was an off-day, but I'd rather just go to Congee Queen and wait for food that is guaranteed to be good, every time."}
{"text":"I've been here about 8-10times, Not usually busy.  Service is a bit slow sometimes. Food is good. Never disappointed. There are 2 private booths in the back. Small booth fits up to 8, and the large room can fit up to 12+.

Lots of parking at night. 
Recommended !!"}
{"text":"My cousin introduced me to this place, and I thought the sushi was pretty good until one day.. I decided to try .. THE GRILLED WHITE TUNA ROLL. *cue angel music*. Everyone knows its called Butterfish because it melts in your mouth.. well, what melts in your mouth better than warm butter? Grilled White Tuna roll. Oh mama. sooo good. The Lobster rolls is good too.. In fact their special rolls (the ones I've had anyway) are all very good!

Eat there JUST for the grilled butterfish goodness. Just for that experience alone, its worth it. 

:o)"}
{"text":"When we're in the Markham area, we visit this restaurant. Staff is a lovely korean family. The bento boxes are good and congee appetizers are loved by the kids."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot although it doesn't seem like it gets a lot of business. Ordered the all day bento box for $15 (3 sushi and 3 sashimi assorted, tempera, teriyaki beef, 2 gyozo dumplings, salmon pizza, miso soup, salad, congee, mango ice cream). Definitely a lot of food! They give you options for the bento box.

Service was okay but not as attentive even though we were the only ones there. 

Food - tempura was delicious! salmon sushi was really good, like a crab cake kinda of patty with salmon on top. Sashimi wasn't fresh, so not the best I've had. They give you tuna, salmon and red snapper. Gyozo dumplings were blah. Mango ice cream was yum, but how can you fault mango? ... Overall not a bad lunch"}
{"text":"After a long day at High Park, we brought our sweaty selves here for some sushi. I gotta say... their Gyoza is the best I've had yet! It was fried just right and the meat was very tender unlike other places where it's all dry and just... yuck! Anyway, my friends and I ordered the bento box special and it was a pretty fair deal. 
For $16.95 you get to choose an appetizer, a main course and dessert! For the appetizer I chose the Salmon Sushi Pizza and it was yet another hit for me!!! As for the main course, I had Eel on Rice and Bulgogi on the side. Lastly, a scoop of green tea ice cream to top everything off! Besides from these options, the benton comes with tempura (shrimp & assorted veges), two pieces of Gyoza, Japchae w/ bean sprouts, miso soup and salad. There was also complimentary congee! Now, that was interesting... I've never been served a little bowl of congee before at a Japanese restaurant. At the end of it, all of our bellies were full and we were happy! 

Service was attentive. We were always being checked up on here and there to see if we're doing okay. Our tea was always refilled and they always brought us a new bottle of water once it was empty! WOOHOO!

They have a number of booths if you prefer more privacy and there's also a section at the back with even bigger booths and sliding doors! For these booths, you'd have to take for your shoes...but nonetheless, it'd be an interesting experience to dine in an authentic Japanese way. 

I will be back for those authentic booths!!"}
{"text":"Oshio Restaurant is located at The Shops on 404 and Steeles. There are no interior access inside the mall, only through their entrance facing Steeles across from Congee Queen. 

I almost did not go in Oshio Restaurant.. There are no business hours posted on the front door and the \"OPEN\" sign was not lit! I thought they might be closed for lunch on this particular weekday afternoon. 

The deco is older traditional Japanese...there are some booth like more private seatings on one side of the restaurant. 

The waitresses were ok in general, only one of the girls were the friendliest which work the cash.. asked me how my lunch was and smile... the other has this oh so not pleasant and pissed off looks... 

Lunch Special Sushi B ($9.95) 
- Both Miso Soup and Salad were below standard... Miso soup really watery and salad are pre prepared, sitting in the fridge undercovered for the longest time before it was delivered to my table.. the dressing was kind of stuck together and some lettuce had turned brownish... 
- Sushi set has 9 pieces of sushi which 4 of them were salmon... and a cucumber roll 
- Fish itself is quite fresh.. the Shari rice itself is not bad.. but nothing makes me went WOW... 
- The cucumber rolls were A-OK.. the seaweed are nice and crisp and have tons of flavour... 
- Maybe I expect too much for a $10 set lunch.......... 

They accepts All credit cards!"}
{"text":"excellent service.  great clean atmosphere.  food is also very good.  all round a very nice surprise considering it is attached to this dinosaur mall."}
{"text":"Oshio is a neighbourhood Japanese restaurants at Steeles and Don Mills. I'm always looking for good Japanese restaurants near where I live, and after reading positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.

We had complimentary congee and tofu to start. These were pretty good. 

My favourite part of the meal was the assorted tempura, as it was very freshly fried. The interior was piping hot and the batter was light and not overly greasy. The tempura was very enjoyable in terms of both taste and texture.

I ordered two roll combos so I got to sample Oshio's California roll, spicy dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, and spider roll. I particularly liked the spicy tuna roll. The spider roll, however, was a disappointment. Although it looked great, the soft shell crab itself had an revolting taste that ruined the whole roll. In addition, the soft shell crab warmed up the rice, which made the roll rather unpleasant to eat. 

All in all, I wasn't very impressed with Oshio, and the spider roll sort of ruined the meal for me. I don't think I'll be returning to this place, since there are so many Japanese restaurants to try around the area."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon and I quite enjoyed the sushi here. I ordered the sushi lunch set B and it was just the right proportion. The fish was fresh and the rolls were good too. What's interesting as well is that aside from the usual salad and soup that a set comes with, it also has a little bowl of congee. Out of all the sushi places I've been to this is the only place that serves it so that's different. The wait was not long at all either, we got seated right away and the food came relatively fast. Maybe because it was a weekday lunch, but it feels like it does not get that much business. I would come back to eat here again though as the prices aren't too high for the amount of sushi you get."}
