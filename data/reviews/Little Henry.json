{"text":"Great little spot to grab a snack, lunch, or a coffee! The avocado chocolate cake is amazing. The prices are a bit high but I think the quality makes up for it. Definitely a gem in Victoria park!"}
{"text":"The food was served promptly and it was delicious. The drinks were refreshing, we had tea and a chocolate smoothie. The breakfast sandwich was a perfect start to my day. I love that it's locally owned and the atmosphere is so polite and welcoming."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. The staff are amazing and fast and the prep on the food and taste is a 10/10 all the time .."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee, but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of fresh baked goods, considering it's categorized as a bakery. Price is also on the high end."}
{"text":"Greatly enjoyed our treats from Little Henry, and the staff were so friendly.  The ham sandwich with smoked mustard, cherry jelly donut (I think, as reported by my 7 year old) and chocolate filled pastry- all very, very flavourful and tasty.  Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Really nice little cafe. I've visited Little Henry's for the past three days partly for it's proximity to the hotel I'm staying in, but mainly for the friendly service and the amazing breakfast sandwich! This morning there was some sort of miscommunication between the front counter and the kitchen and my sandwich wasn't ready by the time I had to depart. The staff were genuinely apologetic, took care of me in a very professional way and left me completely satisfied. My only regret is that I missed out on the sandwich today, but I'm now enjoying a superfood salad that they provided. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ok, I'm still cleaning the last tiny bits of my breakfast sandwich from my teeth, savouring this flavour as much as I can - but this needs documenting before I forget what it tastes like.

Little Henry's breakfast sandwich just took first place as my favourite AM sammy in the city. That's no easy feat. But from the lightly golden crust of the bun to the evenly runny yolk to the  flavour burst in the sauce... which I can't quite place, but I'll update as I demolish more of these delightful morsels in the coming weeks, it was a superbly satisfying way to start off my morning.

Your average coffee goer who may enjoy their cup from the chain across the street might find this cafe more expensive than they're used to, but if you're in the neighbourhood and care to have food that's prepared fresh and guaranteed to make you smile from the belly on up and a cup of coffee you'll appreciate every sip of the way, you'll want to be stopping in to Little Henry."}
{"text":"Cute little place by ten foot Henry with very friendly and helpful staff.  I had the breakfast sandwich ($7) - rosemary ham, greens, topped with a sunny side up and some melted cheese in brioche buns. It was delicious!  I also had the chai tea latte (with almond milk), which tasted very watered down. I probably will not order it again.  Will definitely be back for another breakfast sandwich and to try the other stuff!"}
{"text":"The yam tortilla, a sort of tart with many layers of mandolin sliced sweet potato and a savoury egg mixture. with nigella sour cream is one of the single best things I've ever had at a coffeehouse. It's CUISINE. Amazing. Absolutely stunning. And great value at just $9 for a dish that really belongs in the larger restaurant, and I mean that in the best way possible. I also got a cherry stuffed donut that is big enough for two people and it was also stunning. Just a great, great lunch."}
{"text":"So my friends have been raving and RAVING about this breakfast sandwich at Little Henry so after a gym session I decided to grab one from the café. The menu doesn't state what is exactly in the breakfast sandwich but I trusted my friends that it would be as amazing as they said it would be.

I walk into the café, I was greeted and asked if I had any questions. I browsed at the goodies in the display but I knew that I wanted this sandwich. \"Breakfast sandwich to go please!\" 

After paying, I sat on the stool and waited for my order which didn't take too long. My order was presented to me in an open to go box so I can see it, DROOOOOOOOOOOOOL, I was excited, they left it open face so the egg didn't get squished. I quickly closed it and sped walk to my car. I`m normally an impatient mofo and like to eat food asap but I decided to be patient so I can savor the sandwich when I got home (I did however have a taste of the bun because it was calling my name :))  The top bun had some kind of melted cheese and the whole sandwich came with ham, spring greens, some tomato salsa and of course the fried egg. I sandwiched the bun on top of the egg which made the egg yolk drip down the sandwich, DROOOL again. I took a bite and I understood all the words my friends said about this sandwich, it was sooooo good. There was this mustardy tasting sauce that married everything together so well and the bun was melt in your mouth delicious.

I`m actually drooling as I type this review... I need a little henry breakfast sandwich asap."}
{"text":"so happy Ten Foot Henry has finally opened up the Little Henry side! Coffee, pastries, salads & sandwiches combined with the friendliest service - a much needed addition to this little strip of 1st Street SW!"}
