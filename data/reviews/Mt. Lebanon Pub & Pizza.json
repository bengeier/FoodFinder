{"text":"So good! I stopped in this place after a spin class for a drink with a friend and ended up getting some food to go. I ordered the mild ranch wings and house salad with ranch. 1, best ranch dressing! 2, such a great flavor for wings! I will definitely be going back and can't wait to try more of their food with RANCH DRESSING!"}
{"text":"Con artists. Went there for happy hour and advertised 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off beers and drinks. Awesome. Had a good time.

Went there next week. Waited until we got out check and waitress said \"Oh, only certain appetizers are half off and you guys got the other ones. Very disappointed because that's wasn't what was advertised.

Went back a third time for a buddy's birthday/happy hour. This time ordered the correct appretizers but NOW SHE SAYS AFTER SHE BROUGHT THE OUTRAGEOUS CHECK...\"Oh, only drafts are half off.\" I was so angry it wasn't even funny. Will not go back to this place with this kind of false advertising!!!"}
{"text":"My original review was on Duke's Pub and Pizza.  Since my original review the location has been renamed to Pub & Pizza.  It is under new management.  I received a yelp message last week from Courtni - from Pub & Pizza.  She had read my review and wanted to offer us a coupon to give the location another shot.  I took her up on her offer - as I mentioned previously, they are very close - and our first visit was not impressive.

Now to my review.  :)

I ordered the Philly Burger; son #1 had a Ruben, son #2 had an order of 12 wings - mild spice.

My Burger was cooked as I ordered it - well seasoned.  Very filling.  My side salad (House) was standard, no bells and whistles, but it's hard to mess up Salad.  My only suggestion would be with a burger that great - you need your vegtables to steal the show also - perhaps a creative sauce or something on the peppers/onions/mushrooms.  Overall I was happy with the meal.

My son LOVED his Reuben, he says that the bread was crunchy, the amount of meat was huge!  He had a side of coleslaw and he enjoyed that as well.

The wings, my son loves wings, he said these were OK.  He did take them home - he ordered the mild spice - and said to him they tasted ok, but the spice was weird flavored.  lol  I tasted them and they tasted fine to me.  Not sure what he was expecting. 

I will say the food has improved overall.  The menu is new.

The staff was friendly and wanted to make sure we were taken care of.

Thank you to the Pub & Pizza in going the extra mile to make sure your customers are satisfied."}
