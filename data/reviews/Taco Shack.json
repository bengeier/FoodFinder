{"text":"Went there for my first time yesterday and had 2 carne aside tacos and thought it looked and tasted a little funky but wasn't sure. Felt sick last night and woke up this morning drenched in sweat. My boyfriend and I both got food poisoning. Still feel sick and wish I would have never eaten there."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance. Great decision. The cashier said everything on the menu is incredible. The four of us each got something different, we all felt the cashier was spot on. VERY reasonably priced. My wife and I paid $13 total for 2 meals."}
{"text":"The new go to spot for quick mexican. They're struggling a bit with consistency.. More of a food cost issue than major quality control in my mind because it's always tastes great. Would definitely recommend trying it out sometime."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese enchiladas! I'm a enchilada snob being from California, and the Mexican food here is authentic and delicious. Well priced and great service."}
{"text":"I'm glad there is a new spot in the area that offers several vegetarian options on the menu! The service was super friendly (a nice young man at the register who seemed like he really cared) and the place is no frills, but clean. Their flour tortillas were killer, thick and chewy. The beans had good flavor. I agree with the first reviewer who said that a salsa bar is needed, since the tacos didn't come with any cabbage salad or pico or anything. The other items we had could all have used a boost of flavor, and it took way too long to get our food, so we probably will wait a little while for things to smooth out in the kitchen before we come back, but we will be back, and I'll update my review! A place that bothers to put a thoughtful vegetarian option in every category deserves a second chance to me."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Taco Shack. It's close to my house and I liked the vegetarian options (Anarcho Vegan Taco with veggie sausage).  If you buy the 3 taco combo which comes with tortillas and rice and beans (to make a few extra tacos) you could potentially feed two people for $10. Not bad.  My first couple of visits were inconsistent but overall pretty decent.  However, I think I have made my last visit to Taco Shack. For no apparent reason they switched from using a very yummy veggie sausage product in the Anarcho Vegan to one of the most disgusting, bland, freezer burned Costco veggie patty protein that I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. I can only assume it was a decision by management to save money on ingredients because no self-respecting cook would voluntarily serve that garbage. Bummer."}
{"text":"Hey guys, so I found this little taco spot right on University not to far from my job. My co workers and I tried it today and I must say that it did not disappoint....at all!  I had the #1 which is any 3 classic tacos, rice and beans.   I also got a beer battered fish taco (greedy).  I would recommend this for a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Service seemed slow. The cheese on these tacos were not my thing. The carne asada was tough and bland. Coke zero was OK though."}
{"text":"I've sampled breakfast tacos from across the country, Austin TX being the unofficial capital, and Taco Shack's are the bomb. The soft-made tortillas are on point. Great value."}
{"text":"I arrived 10 minutes early and was greeted by Seveaine working at the counter. She let me know that Taco Shack doesnt open until 11am however since it's quite warm outside that I can sit in the dining area. This courtesy really set the overall tone for my interaction with the restaurant.   Seveaine was prepared for my inquiries for the vegetarian tacos and provided me with the info that the filling has been replaced from Morning Star branded ground beef with Boca Ground Beef. This is a great alternative that is Vegan. I also ordered two Red Chili Colorado style tacos, horchata and Peach Tea. The peach tea is Peace brand tea in a tallboy. Overall, my experience this morning has left me wanting to come back and bring my friends. I appreciate the kindness that was shown and the portions."}
{"text":"Amazing little taco place! I had the three taco combo with Barbacoa, chicken mole, and grilled shrimp. All were amazing but the barbacoa was simply outstanding. Three hefty tacos, rice, beans and drink for $10 is a steal. Great place that I will definitely be returning to again and again. Staff was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Excellent grilled shrimp tacos!!  Moist and filling, no need for extra sauce but they give you 2 salsas with meal and have about 20 varieties of hot sauce for optional use as well.  Happy to see the bottled sauces include LaVictoria's Taco Sauce for those of us who prefer a milder red sauce.  Tasty guac too and all prepped fresh to order.   Thanks guys -- great improvement over Chipxxx!  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I had taco and burrito taco was good but burrito was disgusting. Burrito was California burrito had inside rice, potato, and meat also had LONG HAIR. They gave me new one but still was disgusting first one."}
{"text":"I like the seafood tacos, my favorite is the grilled shrimp. It tastes so fresh and the sauce is good flavor. I took the drunken steak taco home and ate it later, it was still super good.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Thigh meat grilled chicken taco, definitely not something I like. The quesadilla was delicious though!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible!!! I arrived 6 minutes before they close and was still treated like a god! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is clean, and the location is brilliant. Treat yourself nicely and visit this place!"}
{"text":"Been to a lot of places for tacos and this was one of the best places for tacos! The tacos are phenomenal and don't get me started on the loaded carne frys XD -Mindspark Staff"}
{"text":"Beer battered fish taco everyday at least once. This is one of my favorite parts of the day, this taco is absolutely delicious in every way and not to much or two little of food. The fish is freshly cooked, hot and crispy and actually juicy as well. Smothered in an excellent hot sauce (which they have a plethora of a selection compared to anywhere else in town) makes my day every time. Thank you Taco shack for openning a nice lil mom n pop food spot in downtown tempe!"}
{"text":"A hidden jem of a Mexican restaurant. Very similar to chipotle in how food is ordered, but with fresh, authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"The food has always been great.  I am thankful that the service has improved as well.  I go a couple times a month now."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the neighborhood nearby and come here at least once a month. We've tried pretty much all the tacos and have liked them all. I particularly like the Fish and Colorado."}
{"text":"I ordered a taco salad and specifically said like a tostada salad. It's not on the menu but they said we'll make you one. I paid $9.00 for it and went back to work. I opened it up and it was iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato, sprinkled Mexican cheese and chopped avocado which I paid $1.00 extra for (told by cashier when I ordered), and crumbled tortilla chips. (No meat, no beans, no cilantro.....I called and questioned if it was by mistake and Nope, $8.00 salad for lettuce tomato, cheese & crumbled tortilla chips. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the girl that was helping me was on her phone and I was not greeted. I asked for a moment and she went back to her phone and counter that was cluttered with lots of electronics .When I was ready to order the girl seemed agitated and rushed. Luckily the food was made quickly and was delicious so I will return hoping for a better more friendly customer service experience."}
{"text":"I posted a review a bit ago about this place. I maintain my position that they have great tacos, but when I went in for the second time a few days ago, I was royally disappointed.  I went around 12:30, so safe to say the place was pretty busy. But nothing new for a fast food restaurant that is around a bunch of businesses (so tailored to people on their lunch breaks). As soon as I walk on, a gentleman sitting down tells me \"I hope you have some time because I've been waiting for my food for 30 minutes\" and another couple said they've been waiting for 45. I stuck it out anyway but ended up waiting an HOUR yes, an HOUR for 3 tacos. And everyone in there did too. I mean, I've been to taco places in that area that were even more busy and I've only waited 15 minute tops.   They need to hire more than just ONE person in the front. Their chefs need to work faster, because let's be real, all the orders overlap: tortilla, cheese, pico, so there's no need to spend 20 minutes on each order. And last but not least, if you're customers, many of which are on a 30 minute lunch break,  have been waiting 1hr for their food, at least offer them some chips and water!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Even though I showed up super late during closing time the staff greeted me with respect and helped me get my order."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here.  The beef tacos are really really good.  The place looks clean, and the even clean.  I like the TV and the music.  I will be back next time in Tempe."}
{"text":"Tacos tacos tacos!! ... and it's not even Tuesday! The chicken tinga is wonderful, and the guacamole is so good! It's a good thing they only deliver after 5pm (3mile radius)  otherwise I would just be lazy and have them deliver me they're delicious food all the time. Legit grub in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Tacos sucked, they use mozzarella on their tacos which is stupid. They messed up my order after reading it back twice, one while placing it and another when I picked it up. There were two good things: my refund and the guac. Hasta Luego para siempre!"}
{"text":"Taco Shack is a great place if your looking for quality service at an affordable price. Ive had better mexican food before, but for the price and service you cant go wrong! Would reccomend!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best tasting taco place in Tempe and probably one of the best in Arizona. Their drunken steak taco is amazing and they have great customer service too. Definitely need to try it out if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, I would definetly recommend! My go to taco spot in Tempe. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Looks great!  Here is the full menu:  http://www.hexadecimalx.com/temp/tacoshack.jpg   Update 2015.11.06:  Has definitely gone downhill since they opened. Food is not consistent, and although the hours on their website state they open at 6:00 am, when I went there at 6:30 they were closed, and the hours posted said they open at 11:00 am. So much for breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Had a bean and cheese burrito about four hours ago. Currently sitting in my bathroom typing this review between vomit sessions. Thanks, Taco Shack."}
{"text":"Overpriced, average, and small portions. Burrito only has your choice of meat, cilantro, and onions... What a waste of $6. Save your money and go to Chipotle. Atleast you get customer service and a decent sized burrito at Chipotle. The building is small and no place to bring a date."}
{"text":"If you want super duper authentic tacos, I'd suggest driving to Phoenix. If you want a really good taco plate with beans and rice, come to Taco Shack. I think that their carne asada tacos are flavorful and filling.  My college student sister introduced me to these guys and honestly between their prices, quality and proximity to my house, this place is my jam. It's never crazy busy in the store and it's well maintained in terms of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is great because it has delicious food. They make large tacos with great flavor (the carnitas is our favorite).  The guacamole is also wonderful. A couple of things to improve: having more reliable delivery available and a website with the menu. When we asked about delivery (we live within a half mile), they were not sure if they could deliver, even though it was within their delivery hours. When we asked about a menu for delivery, they told us to take a picture of the menu. I am sure that those wrinkles will get ironed out, but I deducted a star for the inconvenience. Overall, it is one of our regular places. If you are thinking about some Mexican, definitely give this one a try!"}
{"text":"First time in my life for international food like taco. The best bacon taco in tempe. Nice place and clean."}
{"text":"This place was great I had some wonderful fish tacos crispy just the right amount of slaw and their homemade hot sauce was great... red or green The Taco Shack will be on my list of favorite taco places to get wonderful tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"This place rules. Been looking for a good quick taco place that's a step above filibertos and this is certainly that place. Very excellent seafood tacos and burritos and the prices are super reasonable. Always makes me sad to see that not many people are in the store when I swing by (although I'm always at strange hours), because it definitely deserves to be packed. Check this place out near campus ASAP!"}
{"text":"I hoped to check in early at the hotel but no room was clean. The clerk said I should go eat lunch and she'd have a room ready when I got back. She gave me a sheet of paper with local restaurants listed and said I should drive by every restaurant on the list and find the Taco Shack which wasn't even on the piece of paper. She said the Taco Shack wasn't listed, but I should go find it because it would be worth the trouble. She also told me to get the beer battered fish burrito. She tried to describe it to me but forgot how to use her words and just made moaning sounds and hand gestures and euphoric eye movements and finally blurted out to just get it. She was right. I ordered the burrito and it was huge and delicious especially with a small side of guacamole. I added a grilled shrimp taco as a side which was also wonderful. The food was juicy and flavorful and way too much to eat in one sitting. I wrapped up half the burrito and took it back to the hotel with me and had it for a late night snack when I returned from my meetings. So good!  The place is small and tucked away at the end of a building and you may not see it driving down University, but you shouldn't give up. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Seating is a bit limited but I found a corner to hide in.  If I was a good person I would have brought a burrito back to the hotel clerk, but I didn't think of it until I walked in the door. I thanked the clerk for steering me right and apologized for not buying her lunch, but I carefully hid the leftover half burrito behind me because I didn't want to share. She was a good person and hooked me up with an early check in anyway. Winner all around!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos around! Burritos as well! The food here kicks butt!! Always look forward to eating from here. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I live 1 block away and I'm addicted to the carnitas tacos, and their red and green salsa is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I want to say that this is my favorite taco place, but I have had so many great tacos its hard to say this is my \"go to\" place. I want to say this because, if they COULD be more consistent and use just a tad less oil, it would top all others out there. Street tacos, everything. I know that in many Mexican dishes (me being Mexican as well) things are greasy but if this this cook or I don't know how its a hit n miss but tonights tacos were perfect to where the grease isn't coming from a taco and the tortilla isn't soaked in grease, its a little crunchy, and the meat is cooked perfectly.  If it were consistent like this it would be a 4.75 stars. Right now I give it a 3.75 range.  Which is great to me."}
{"text":"We love this place. Decently priced food, and everything is delicious. Because we are vegetarian we really appreciate the specialized options. If you like desserts, try the churros because they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place and eat there all the time. We always order takeout and it's awesome. Their nachos are great, and my wife always gets their grilled shrimp burrito!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos!  Keep in mind they're pretty big .  Definitely recommend when you are in the area!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here at 8:30 on a Sunday (yes, late... I know... But they close @10!)   Let me start out with the service: Not good. Not that the young man working the counter wasn't friendly or quick to come to the register to take our order, but right when I started to order the phone rang and he answered it and proceeded to talk to whoever it was on the phone (assuming a manager because he said something about lunch tomorrow and what he was wearing). Hellllllo customer service 101?!? You DO NOT have a conversation while someone is ordering.. Especially not with a manager.   Food: honestly, I LOVE tacos. These were definitely the worst tacos I've ever had . Very salty, the toppings were minimal and the meat was just not appetizing (also see picture: carne asada taco) Unfortunately, wasn't like what we saw in other Yelpers' reviews/pictures.   Cool concept, but definitely don't think we'll be giving it another try, which is a shame because it would be a nice little place to have if it were good."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre food, It's slow for food to come out, and the service is probably one of the worst I've experienced. Rude as f. This place blows."}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! Most freindly and helpful hostess/cashier/waitress! Will be in every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST TACOS in Phoenix!! Love this place!! Delivery was quick and everything arrived hot and tasty!! Will be for sure ordering from here again! Highly recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"The reason for 2 stars is because they had Vegan options, but the customer service could use some touch up. We stood in front of the cashier to order for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to come and take our order. When the young lady arrived her energy seemed like she was forced to work there. Food was ok but the service ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. It's local convenient not Too overpriced the staff is generally friendly with me. I'm giving 4 stars instead of five because the vegan burrito is really bad and you can't just offer something vegan but have it literally be tortilla with some lettuce and fake sausage. Maybe make your beans vegan or something. Everything else is great but think of the vegans!"}
{"text":"Everybody and their was real good, your courtesy, you're helpful. It was nice and clean and everybody in is your friendly to and real helpful I would recommend Taco Shop to anybody"}
{"text":"really really good tacos! chicken quesadilla was pretty good! free churro tasted a little freezer burnt and lacked sugar."}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos were good. Definitely would be back for those. Rice and beans were nothing special. Would recommend this place if you are looking for a good taco."}
{"text":"Ordered the taco plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans were old and the rice was undercooked and crunchy and also cold. No limes were provided with the tacos. The red and green salsa is bland and lacking flavor. I also ordered queso fundido with chips the queso was cold and the chips were so stale. I love trying new Taco shops and I'm disappointed that there is no effort put into this establishment.  How do you screw up a street taco? This place has only been open for a week and it's already burned out. Go to el supreme down the street way better Mexican food.  $26 down the toilet for street tacos."}
{"text":"yummy vegan anarcho taco. hard to find a place in Phoenix that offers a vegan taco. would come here again.  nice and Clean place"}
{"text":"found this place on doordash and honestly have been ordering way more than i should be. tried almost everything already, but the bean burrito and chorizo breakfast taco are my personal favorites, great portion sizes and taste is spot on. salsas are awesome too!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite taco place in Phoenix. The drunking burrito is amazing just like everything else I've had there. Amazing."}
{"text":"Good food, even better prices. 4 stars only because the service could be a little better. I would highly recommend this place for Mexican food near downtown Tempe!"}
{"text":"The chorizo taco is amazing. Among the best I've had. Also got the chicken Tinga burrito with the taco as a combo. The chicken was good but I felt there was way too much beans which overwhelmed the flavor and left me hunting for the chicken.  I would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Very clean place and amazing food.  I will be back to try more favors.  love the Barbados."}
{"text":"What a great find! Really good food,  cheap prices, huge portions! Had the carnitas burrito and chicken fajita taco.... tons of meat, great flavor! They honored the check in offer no problem... really friendly service AND they deliver?!? One of my new favorites!  *edit: they actually only deliver through those food apps...despite what it says on their site... but still... excellent food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and it will be my last visit. I ordered carne asada tacos which were salty beyond belief. My shell was soggy and it only mde my experience worse. I also ordered the Chile colorado taco was moist but didnt have much flavor.  I had high expectations based on the reviews but I ended up disappointed. I wish them the best but again I wont return."}
{"text":"It took me 14 minutes exactly to get two carne Asada tacos to go. The place didn't have many people waiting so not sure what the hold up was for!  The carne asada was COLD dried out, and chewy. It had zero flavor was was of cheap quality. By far this was the most disgusting taco taco I have ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Ordered from uber eats so I dont knkw about the dine in service, but rhe food is great!. I got the trio tacos. N the chorizo one so far is thee best!. Highly recommended as a taco tuesday place 2 be"}
{"text":"I went recently with a friend after having passed it a few times. We both tried the three taco special and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Their prices are extremely fair, and their churros (2 per order for 2 dollars) are delicious.    The service was wonderful as well,  as soon as we walked in we were asked if we had been there before,  having not,  she explained the menu and answered all of the questions  we have.    It was clean and even had some pretty great music playing.   Our only mild complaint is that the food is very mild.  However,  this isn't an issue as they also have a huge (around 10) array of hot sauces. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Brought my friend to check out the new taco shop.  I ordered the chili relleno plate which was outstanding.   Refried beans and Spanish rice were nice to see as opposed to whole beans and white rice.  I was told the chili relleno's would be coming off the menu which is disappointing.  They say it takes too much time to make in a fast food environment.. whatever.  I guess I will try something else next time.  My friend ordered the chicken fajita tostada which appeared to be quite a value at $3.25 or whatever.  One tostada filled her up.  We ate our meal on the patio at Thai Elephant so we could order from their bar.  It was a nice environment and the food tasted very good."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I eat here at lunch a couple times a week. All of the food is substantial - big portions of quality meat, and is reasonably priced. The battered shrimp and battered fish tacos are huge, and with big, meaty shrimps in an awesome beer batter. So good. The loaded fries are amazing. Decor is sparse, but place is super clean and modern-industrial vibe."}
{"text":"This is a new location of my old favorite, and it doesn't disappoint! The food is spot on. Drunken steak burrito is absolutely amazing.  I get it w guac and sour cream. Love the grilled fish tacos, carne asada, red chili, it's all good and they have a bunch of choices. Very clean, and quality food. Super stoked that they are open closer to home."}
{"text":"I'm skeptical and critical of tacos and burritos in Arizona.   This shrimp burrito was 100% delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came on taco Tuesday and was very impressed. I've tried tacos from fast food, to sit down, to \"authentic\", and even tacos from a little known place in phoenix that is in a families backyard and only serves on thur/fri/sat nights. These are definitely my local fav. The chicken tinga was amazazing!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, they have great burritos and the space is a bit more upscale than a shack.   This place sits a notch above your local bertos, think of it as a local genuine option to chain fast casual places.   I appreciate the fact there are several veg burrito options including one with soy sausage.   The in-house red and green sauce is standard and good, they also do offer a selection of unique bottled hot-sauces to add some more spice."}
{"text":"I love a good taco and they did not disappoint.  They were made fresh to order, good in size and the quality of meat/fish was on point.  The menu looks to have many options and a good variety. There is also good value in you get what you pay for.  My only recommendation that I gave them would be to have a salsa bar.  If in the area I recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little taco shop in Tempe. Was looking for somewhere to get a quick and delicious bite and turned the corner and here this place was. Not only did they have an excellent selections to choose from for tacos but the lady at the front register was extremely nice and friendly. She greeted me when I walked in the door, gave me her opinion on what was good when I asked, not only that but she also let me know if I checked into yelp I'd get a free churro. It was a very pleasant experience and next time I am in the area I will definitely be coming back. The chicken and shrimp tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 taco plate for 9.99 that came with 3 tacos of my choice a drink rice and beans. I specifically asked about the taco shells and was told they are fried fresh and super crunchy. I get back to work (4 minute drive) and that is when I found out what I bought. Barbacoa was dry and under seasoned, the chicken was bland and had the same texture as taco bell chicken chunk, and the carne asada was bland and had that cooked yesterday and then reheated beef taste, the hard taco shells were chewy Ortega style shells that I literally could not eat, two fresh corn tortillas, and pretty decent rice and beans. I do have to say that the rice and beans while no where near authentic were pretty tasty. Thankfully I was able to transfer the meat from two of my tacos into the \"fresh\" tortillas so they were at least eatable. The service was quick and super friendly. The menu was to the point and not too busy or hard to decide. I would not go back here if a friend offered to buy. I want to say I had a horrible experience but I really didn't. I had a wonderful experience and horrible food."}
{"text":"asked the guy how big the tacos were and he goes \"about 6 inches\" .... so i order 2 carne asada tacos thinking these are some big tacos but they come out to be these small like 4 inch tacos lol ...   taste wise it was ok ive had better"}
{"text":"The employees are really welcoming.It's super nice inside, nice environment. I'm honestly happy I found this place. Haven't been to a place as comforting as this in a while. Definitely recommend Taco Shack for breakfast lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"So far so good. Food is great . Nice quiet place to enjoy some good tacos. Great location in tempe easy to find. Very friendly management"}
{"text":"Live every day like it is Taco Tuesday.   Important words to take to heart so seeking out an epic day of tacos, I ventured off to Taco Shack. The shack was not busy at all when I arrived. Just two people sitting in the corner chatting about business. This visit was late on Tuesday afternoon around four-ish. From ordering to receiving my food, I was in & out within 10 minutes. That's some speedy service!  Sadly, no salsa bar but your food does come with red & green salsas. Both were too hot for my enjoyment. However, I'm sure some people would like the heat.   The Chicken Tinga taco was Ah-MAZ-YUM!! Topped with tomatoes, cheese, and a cream sauce. Those tacos merit 5 stars alone! I could eat a whole plate of them. Seriously. Give me a taco platter with those on it, please!    The current Yelp check-in offer is for a free churro. I had no issue redeeming this offer. The churro was very tasty despite being fairly light in color - not doughy at all and cooked throughout.   I tried the vegan Anarcho Kale taco. I was not a fan. This might be because I'm only \"sometimes a vegetarian\" but I also wasn't thrilled at the fact that it seemed to have pieces of chopped up french fries in it. Fresh grilled veggies would be preferred. The avocado appeared to be too rip and yet had brown spots so that was disappointing as well. I'd say pass on this one, fo' sure.   Sadly, they had no Agua Frescas available to try when I went. Would have loved to sample their horchata. I guess this means another visit  for some Chicken Tinga tacos might be in my near future!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews! The fried shrimp tacos are amazing! I also recommend the carne asada nachos. My favorite taco in Tempe for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff was not very friendly to our party. The side of sour cream was $3. (Are you kidding me?) I would come back here because the tacos were alright and so were the enchiladas but it's nothing to write home about. There isn't a lot of seating space inside.  The parking lot also sucks to park in."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast tacos. Barbacoa is insane good. Addicting nice hearty tacos for a good price"}
{"text":"First visit.  Had carne Assad, chicken mole, and carnitas tacos.  All were very good.  They have a variety of bottled sauces. Wish they had some homemade salsas.  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"We checked in because it said \"free churro\". Let it be know that it comes with 2 churros! Lol...  Food is great. Seasoned well, made promptly, and always top notch service.   I'm \"floored\" at that 1 star review going on about how they're not more eco friendly. What a pretentious snob lmao... read it for a good laugh ;)  Haven't tried the vegan tacos, but they sound pretty enticing! Their guac is some of the best I've had at a place offering Mexican food."}
{"text":"Really good taco place!! The chips were amazing and the chicken tacos were really good. The beans and rice were good as well! I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos, good prices, even better music. Very clean and the customer service was super accommodating!"}
{"text":"Got three tacos with refried beans and rice. Everything was good but just that. Tacos and salsa are just not what I usually go for. My fiancé loved and inhaled his food before we knew it. Will come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Super tasty, quick Mexican food! Great to have something in the neighborhood that's nicer than FillyB's but not a $50 meal. Stick to the tacos and burritos as the enchiladas weren't spectacular. The crispy shelled tacos were delicious, especially the barbacoa and chicken tinga. They are fried to order, so super fresh and not really greasy at all. Chips and guac were on point. Save room for dessert - fried ice cream and churros! 5 stars, would return.  One complaint: the music. They were playing early 2000's heavy metal/rock. Definitely not my jam and not very welcoming.The restaurant itself lacks charm but the food is fantastic, so give it a shot! I'm hoping as they settle in, the ambiance will improve. Nonetheless, the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday expecting based on reviews that the tacos would be higher quality. The tacos were extremely salty and not very tasty. They were also soggy with little toppings. Additionally, the service was extremely slow. I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I recommend chicken mole and barbacoa tacos.. 2 were enough to fill my stomach. Got a free churro by checking on Yelp... And good service."}
{"text":"Writing this review without even trying the food. I called to find out if they delivered. The answer I got was \"3 mile radius \". I said thanks I'll call back with my order. The guy just hung up. I called back 5 times within a 20 min period. No answer. It was 730. By the tone of the person answering the phone it seemed like they didn't want to deliver. I posted a picture of my times called in the photo section."}
{"text":"We love this place. So many choices to choose from. Have lunch here you won't have room for dinner. Best taco place in the town! Yum!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos, decent prices, friendly quick service. Since when was it ok to use mozzarella on a taco? Most likely won't return."}
{"text":"Poor service. I walked in and the kid in the hat just said here for grub hub?  I said no, then he turned his back to me and ignored me for a few minutes playing with some bags then. When I asked questions about the menu items he was very stoic and rude.... no smile..i just walked out..who has time for this?"}
{"text":"First time here, Hands down Amazing Food. I had the 3taco meal with rice and beans. Each taco was filled with juicy well seasoned carne asada. Amazing meal for an awesome price."}
{"text":"2/22/18 Update:  I STILL love this place. Best tacos around. Staff is legit   5 stars and definitely only one \"$\" not  two \"$$\" Tacos under 3 bucks, burritos under 6. And they actually have red chili Colorado! That's such an authentic New Mexican/Southwestern specialty and this place does it right! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  I absolutely LOVE tacos and have been looking for my new favorite place. This place was meh. I've had better tacos.   I ordered one cheese enchilada and one hard taco. By the time I got my taco it was already soggy, and I absolutely dislike a soggy taco. My taco only had beans and cheese, and I would have liked some other toppings to be included such as lettuce or a pico. The cheese enchilada was tiny and came with a side of refried beans and rice. The rice wasn't very flavorful, and the the red enchilada sauce was very bland. Each meal is served with a side of red and green salsa but they weren't to my tasting. I also got a churro, which good. It was warm, crispy and sugary. I would l have liked more cinnamon.   They had lots of standard items that could have the meat switched out for refried beans to make it vegetarian.   I wish they had a salsa bar, served chips with your meal instead of a tortilla, and had black beans as option. Overall, it wasn't anything special to me."}
{"text":"Taco Shack is pretty legit!  I've gone past this place a bunch of times for ~6months since I play volleyball nearby. Never did I think about stopping by until I moved to the neighborhood and walked home with a deep hunger in my belly that only tacos could fill.  The inside doesn't scream \"tacos!\" other than their Hispanic-ish menu (has some random American foods as well)- looks very hipster-modern in shades of black and gray. Parking is in the back since the front faces McKemy & University, with some patio seating along University. If you're feeling lazy, they will deliver within a 3-mile radius for $3, but the minimum bill amount is $12. Not a bad price for tasty tacos!  Both times I've gone I've gotten just tacos- definitely dig the barbacoa and carne asada! Tacos cost $2-3/per, and they also have burritos, chips & salsa/guac. They don't necessarily have chips & salsa, but will give you small cups of their red and green salsa. Both are crazy hot/spicy!! The green is a bit smokier tasting than the red from what I could tell. Wasn't terribly impressed with their guac as well- tastes and appears just like what I could make with Fry's mix and 2 avocados. If you check in on Yelp, they're supposed to give you an order of churro's. Didn't happen when I tried the first time, maybe next time they will honor it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!!! Best beer battered shrimp tacos ever!!! I also love that they have the Mexican bottled sodas and it's just a chill place to come and eat. Absolutely recommend this place if you want some bomb tacos :)"}
{"text":"Great little taco place. Price is great and always has a special for Taco Tuesday! For alternate eaters they even have a vegan menu. I tried the vegan tacos and they were yummy! You can also get breakfast items all day."}
{"text":"I love tacos, so I really wanted to love this place. I tried, but the chemistry wasn't there. First off, dirty bathrooms. The shack was only open for a few hours this particular day by the time I used the bathroom, so I assume there was no way the bathroom became so trashed and smelly in such a short amount of time. Likely truth is that it hadn't been cleaned from the day(s) before. Same bathroom the staff uses? I hope not.   Portions were small in contrast to price. The value was not there. The food was excellent. The cashier trashed my large order by getting it wrong. Then the order comes out taco by taco. Some in my party ate while others waited. The wait time from ordering to receiving the last taco was  greater than 20 minutes.   They were very apologetic. As an entrepreneur myself, I am sympathetic to anyone starting a new business. Product was good. People needed additional training. Process requires some streamlining. 3stars mean I'll give it another chance. But they earned 2 stars. e.g. I will not be returning.   Clean your bathrooms.  Improve order accuracy Reduce customer wait time"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the environment is nice and clean the employees are respectful and it has fantastic food that will keep me coming back for more"}
{"text":"Well let me tell yall the best tacos and burritos in tempe be right here at this spot awesome portions and fantastic recipes and mixes the hot sauce alway on point highly recommend this to all good food for a good price"}
{"text":"We're from Florence, Oregon. We spent a few days in the Scottsdale area visiting the Mayo Clinic(s), and we stumbled onto this place. There were 4 other diners when we arrived, so it was pretty quiet. We stood at the counter and perused the menu on the wall. The young man who took our order was quite cordial.  I opted for the Grilled Shrimp Burrito, and my wife ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla. Our order was served in about 10 minutes. We were both amazed at the quantity and the quality of our meals. I can say without a doubt, it was the best burrito I've ever had, and her quesadilla was excellent. I give it 5-1/2 stars for the food, and 1/2 a star deduction for the ambiance.  When we return to the area in April, I'll guarantee we'll end up here at least once."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their kale burrito but the service absolutely sucked. I have consistently read that this place is mediocre and that's how I would describe my experience. I came in during the middle of the afternoon when it was empty and the cashier seemed annoyed when I asked about vegetarian options. Clearly, business is going well for this place."}
{"text":"I usually get the carne asada tacos and have not been disappointed. The 3 taco meal with rice and beans is a lot of food. Saw someone order the Monster burrito and it was as long as my forearm. Place is a little small but clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the beef tacos. He said they were bland. I tried the Monster seafood burrito and it was all lettuce with about 6 or 7 shrimp. It was AWFUL. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I usually love to order tacos from here, despite the rude phone interactions when ordering, the tacos are USUALLY great and the food is made quickly. The past few times we've ordered the food has been less that average. The chicken in the grilled chicken tacos is always too salty which makes them unable to eat and they run out of items like guacamole frequently, when in all truth they probably just don't want to make more later in the evening. Sad to see a quick favorite take out place go downhill."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Clean, friendly and very authentic tasting. As I fellow Mexican, I approve."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute bomb! I love my carne asada burrito chimi style with sour cream. It's a lot of food for the price and way better quality than most places! I love treating myself here sometimes  you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco  spot in Tempe. I'm from Cali and I tacos and Mexican food. Definitely a taco snob and this place has some of the best shrimp  tacos  I have ever had. I have tried most of the tacos and they are all delicious...they also have a large salsa selection. You definitely want to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, convenient and more than edible but the consistency could be worked on. I really love tacos and come hear 2 times a month probably. If I don't have experiences where my taco meat was overcooked and dried occasionally or under seasoned it would be better. Maybe the cook should be thought about calculating residual heat into cook times and proper seasoning? The cashiers are often unprofessional, with the younger kid being a really depressing presence consistently, but they are nice. The biggest complaint I have is when I order tacos and there aren't toppings at all. Also the avocado tasted like egg one-time for the avocado salad, as a cook I know it's hard but you have to keep track of avocados and how ripe and what color they are inside and outside. All in all I know it's still a new spot and I always come back so good job for the good things."}
{"text":"I give this place a ONE star revenue NOT due to the quality of the food... the food, the tacos are wonderful! I had 3 tacos, rice and beans and a drink for 10 bucks!  AMAZING...BUTTTT  MY FOOD I ordered for HERE AND NOT TO GO and WAS handed to me IN A STYROFOAM BOX! How NOT GREEN can you possibly get as a business... oh and  all the cups are styrofoam! What? WHat is this 1980?  Is this a cost thing? Is this a greed thing? I mean really food ordered for here was handed to me on materials that will NEVER BIODEGRADE to save costs when you could do the right thing and spend a TINY bit more and at least hand me a paper plate?  I seriously am still in shock about that. Now look I've ate alllll over the world and I just told the lady at the front counter the tacos were incredible but even in rural Arkansas where People throw trash out of their windows when drinking and driving... I've NEVER seen this. To go styrofoam is already annoying and I usually will not order when I know that's the option because I pride myself in being very earth conscious, but to have my food brought to me once I paid in a styrofoam box to eat here????  wow wow wow... maybe the owners should consider   Making some changes and then being able to advertise as a green business. This is 2016. Yes there are Mexican sodas which is RAD cause there's no high fructose corn syrup in them but then... THERES NO GLASS RECYCLING EITHER... floored...  Please consider future generations when starting a business cause this business has been open over a year. Can you imagine how much styrofoam they have contributed to landfills in Phoenix? Just cAuse it's the desert doesn't mean it doesn't matter....  The tacos are great and they have a great hot sauce collection but if you a CONSCIOUS person that tries to live aware and \"green\" this is the furthest place from that...  Note to the owner... I hope this makes you really reconsider saving a few cents... and put in glass recycling and at least buy some paper plates. At least those would biodegrade.  Good tacos tho. Great tacos actually. Got fish and vegan ones. But unfortunately we won't be back for them cause it just feels wrong to support that much waste"}
{"text":"Nice place to get some tacos when craving some variety. The carne asada tacos are probably my favorite beef taco while the chicken mole and chicken tinga are best for chicken."}
{"text":"Food is decent...when they get it right.  My co-workers and I go here a lot.  One day a co worker ordered the grilled chicken salad when it was brought out to him he opened the box and only lettuce, tomato and a few avocado slices - NO CHICKEN!  On a recent visit another co-worker and I got our order to go.  He ordered the Carnitas burrito he asked for cheese, pico and cilantro in his burrito and paid extra for it.  When we got back to the office he did not get any of what he paid extra for.  Kitchen staff is soooooo sloooow!!!!!!  \"Manager/Owner\" ? (Thin guy dark hair and beard) just stands in front on his phone text or looking at facebook, never offers to help with orders no matter how busy they get.  Like I said food is decent however so many other downfalls....."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in the valley. After my wife and I moved to south Scottsdale in the north county area we found this place. The beer battered shrimp and fish tacos our money and I would recommend this place to anyone he great food"}
{"text":"They are not the best tacos in Phoenix but they are pretty darn good! I really like the tortilla they use, it tastes/feels extra fatty! The fish taco was ok but I probably won't be getting it again. I really liked the Carne Asada tacos. They come with guac and pico de gallo. They have a good salsa/hot sauce too! I like going here for lunch sometimes because the proximity to my work place is really convenient."}
{"text":"It's a good spot for tacos!! They have a huge selection hot sauce which is a bonus. The tacos are reasonablly priced, as well as the entrees.  I love their king nachos,but dining in is a better idea than ordering to go. We've had a rude cashier before, who made the experience a bit of a letdown, and not something to look forward to after a long day."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery food arrived still warm. Ordered grilled fish taco...súper! Ordered tostada, chorizo and egg burrito,bean burrito with guac side all good food. Next time try something different off menu. Guac and beans excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch, and I have yet to have something that I dislike. The scrimp burrito is stellar! I also highly recommend getting a side of the jalapeño bacon.   The dining area isn't very big, but it's always clean. The patio is nice too when it's not hot outside. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best grilled shrimp taco I've ever had. Salsas have a kick but not overpowering, quesadilla is incredible. Everything I've seen so far is fantastic, awesome hole in the wall taco shop."}
{"text":"First time being here I always drive past it every time I'm in Tempe and I was craving fish tacos so I decided to try it out. I got the grilled fist tacos 2 of them and a side of chips. And I can say I was very satisfied .  The tacos (not just the fish) are a tad pricy but I can say it's somewhere you might want to spurge on yourself / someone special. It seemed pretty popular there wasn't a dull moment while I was there"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst taco shop I have ever been to. I ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla and it was horrible. To be honest Taco Bell has better quesadillas. The quesadilla had chunks of meat in it that I had to cut to eat. The worst part was there was tough meat and bones in my meat. I cracked my tooth when I bit into a piece of meat that had a bone in it. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. Was hoping for a different experience."}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite taco place in Tempe! Had the Barbacoa and carne asada tacos hands down the best.. you gotta try this place  Carne asada tacos in the picture"}
{"text":"Taco shack is unique . they do have amazing food . their tacos are some of the best in Tempe they have a fairly quick service and a nice little setup . I give them 4 stars based off this . the only reason I dont give them 5 is that the place feels a little cold not in actual temperatures but in an unwelcoming kinda way when I walk in its not somewhere I want to hang out or chill . its a bit depressing . and uncomfortable. But that aside you cant get better tacos for the price"}
{"text":"I'm no food critic, but then again you don't need to be a food expert to know that Taco Shack's tacos are DELICIOSO. They may be a little pricey but its worth it. I recommend the beer battered fish tacos in their deluxe section and the 3 Taco+1 Drink Special. PS, the staff are very hospitable."}
{"text":"Good menu, good service. They even have a few tofu options and shrimp too. Burritos are delicious every time."}
{"text":"Yo--these tacos are v good. Yeah, yeah--Yummy in fact. Y'all should you up a mess of these babies. Pronto.  Yo, pero like cuidado because they put like queso on errthing. Like queso on shit that shouldn't have queso. Queso means cheese for all the whites out there.  But, yeah, v good and the building was nice and whatever."}
{"text":"This place is DOPE. I love the vegetarian tacos with kale & avocado among other yummy ingredients. Good prices for a good amount of hella good food."}
{"text":"Quick service, young man was knowledgeable of the menu.  Reasonably priced, food good.  Ice cold cokes and Dr Pepper in the glass bottles!  PS. Try the green salsa!"}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood gem. I come here at least twice a week and it is always on point. I've never had to wait more than 5 mins and is amazing quality every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when I was in the neighborhood. I had the carne asada 3 taco special and it was very good, much better than I expected. My portion was just fine.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and finally stopped in today for lunch. It was dead so I was a little hesitant but OMG! It was delicious.the tortillas they use for their tacos are the stuff made of dreams! And the tacos are very filling, they don't skimp on the ingredients. I got 2 California tacos (carne asada, potato, cheese and pick de gallo) and a chicken cheese quesadilla. The qusadilla was stuffed as well, with grilled chicken and mozzarella? Cheese. The salsa the give you is really good as well! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The burrito was good. The food was a little overpriced and It took to long to make. They did have a bunch of sauces to try which was awesome."}
{"text":"We came here late one night looking for something quick to eat.... loved it. We ordered chicken tacos and carne Asada tacos. Delicious.... and the hot sauce is spicy with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Visited from San Jose, CA. This place was great! Ordered barbacoa burrito and damn near cried it was so flavorful. Wife ordered shrimp burrito and mentioned that she appreciated the fact that they do not smother beans and cheap you out on the good stuff. My son ordered Carne asada fries (of which I tasted) and everything included was delicious: fries (melt in your mouth), cheese beans, Pico, guac, cream. The house red sauce was better than green - Good spice to it. Free churro was stale. 5 stars to this place!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and delicious breakfast burritos. Have yet to get the chance to try out the rest of the menu, but If it's half the quality of the burritos I will definitely become a regular here. It seemed like a lot of their business is take out through delivery service, but wether you eat in or take out, I support it."}
{"text":"Friendly service with a smile, good food, not great but good.  I'm glad to have a taco place close by with tasty tacos.  The tacos seem authentic.  I'll be back.  They don't seem to advertise so I suspect business will ramp up slowly.  Breakfast now starts at 10 but runs all day."}
{"text":"Ever since I tried this place I can't go anywhere else for tacos. I've ordered the chicken tinga, California, and fried chicken tacos multiple times and they never disappoint. The size surprised me, as they were bigger than I expected for the price. The service is great and and the food is even better. I highly recommend this place for take out or eat in!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  It is nice to find real, fresh from scratch Mexican food.  Had a Carne Asada burrito for lunch today and it was solid.  The tasty refried beans made it.  Ate it with both red and green salsas.  Got out of there for under $8 for a good size burrito and a drink.  Will try tacos next time.  Always excited to eat at a good local restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a place that delivered something other than pizza or chinese food and stumbled upon Taco Shack on Yelp. I ordered the 3 taco combo that came with rice, beans, and a drink and also a carne asada burrito for delivery. The ordering process was quick as well as the delivery. The food was not terrible but nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"A favourite place for a vegetarian. Many options to eat from and any burrito can be converted into a veggie burrito. I usually go for country burrito or the California burrito with no meat. I ask them to replace that with guacamole, sour cream and faijatas. Yummy!!! The most interesting thing in that burrito are the fried potatoes which go so well with the other ingredients. But according to me the true champion is the green salsa which I really cannot get enough off. It is so good with right flavour and spice level I usually ask for 5 cups of them. The taste stays with me for the rest of the day. I am pretty satisfied every time I come to this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some food from this joint on Sunday night. I had the chorizo burrito and my boyfriend had the three taco special. He said it was \"so good\" and that it may just be his favorite taco shop in the area. That's saying quite a bit considering some of the amazing local contenders, like Sombrero's and TC Tacos.   I look forward to trying some of the other offerings here."}
{"text":"This is our new default lunch restaurant! The place is super clean, the staff is incredibly nice and the food is Epic. I've had both the Carne Asada Tacos and the Supreme Carne Asada Nachos, and I'm always full and completely satisfied. The portions are awesome! Ohh, and I love that they have a large variety of hot sauce. It really gives you an opportunity to try something new each time you come.   Oh, and for all you guacamole fans, the Guac here is amazing. You can get your first side of Chips and Guac  free if you write a yelp review, just like I did :-)"}
{"text":"This small taco shop, open less than a week as of this writing, oozes with potential.   The good? Quality ingredients. Clean functional décor (Chipotle-like rather than Mexican taco shop). Friendly service. A simple menu with lots of variety. Indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast available. Television. Great location on University just west of ASU.  The not so good? The taco sauce, both green and red, lacked flavor. Definitely needs to be addressed with a reappraisal of these sauces or with more variety. A salsa bar would be ideal. This is Arizona and we are used to heat in our Mexican food. I loved what I ordered and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, but the taco sauce...  The specials seem to be the best values. The #1 (three tacos, rice, beans, tortilla and drink for ten bucks) is a much more substantial meal than ordering tacos ala carte. My taco was not nearly as generously filled as those in the photo posted on Yelp, an understandable consistency issue I suppose for a restaurant still in training and development mode. The tacos, however, are sized more like street tacos, so at $2.75 each it's important that they be generously filled if the nearby starving student population is going to be attracted.  I'm giving Taco Shack the benefit of the doubt in the star rating because the restaurant is so new. Hopefully I'll be rewarded over time."}
{"text":"I just had a carne asada burrito enchilada style and OMG it was amazing!  I don't know exactly what was in it - but I think it was cilantro that gave it a great flavor, and the rice and beans were in just the right proportion.  I added some tapatio, to spice it up, and yummy!!"}
{"text":"I eat here probably 3 times a week. Breakfast burritos=delicious tacos=top notch. Owned by real local honest people. Solid choice anytime! Taco shack is the shit!"}
{"text":"Favorite taco place in Tempe for sure!! Rolled in about 30min to close, the guys were friendly and the food cane out quick and was fresh! The fish tacos were crispy and well dressed with chipotle mayo, cabbage, and pico. Also had a shrimp burrito that was full of flavor, really didn't need to add any salsa BUT I do have an affinity for green salsa and theirs is SPICY! A++ also did a yelp checkin for a churro order...Best Idea Ever! Each order comes with 2 crunchy but soft and warm cinnamon sugar goodness. Favorite churro I've had in AZ...I compare every churro to Disney's infamous churros and this one stands up to the test! Love love love! They also had Seinfeld on (maybe bc of closing time?) either way, it was a thoroughly entertaining experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I ever had! Yum. Cashier was super nice guy recommended what was truly the best meat in his opinion and I agree Caritas."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burrito in town! If you're looking for an authentic Mexican burrito this is the place to go. Get the monster seafood burrito! That burrito is enough for an entire day worth of meals!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have amazing tacos. Everyone is so nice. I love the kale tacos. Omg! So good. They have a great taco sauce bar too!!! Clean and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I got Uber eats from here, I ordered the loaded nachos. They were the worst nachos I've ever had. I couldn't even eat them. Half the chicken looked over cooked and the other half under cooked. Hardly any cheese, soggy from the giant amount of guac in one corner and beans in the other. Super nasty. Total waste of money. Never getting again."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight GrubHub did awesome on the delivery even the store to make it quick and get it to me ten mins before the est beginning time. But my one star is I paid 10 dollars for a burrito and ask for one thing no pico and guess what it was full of it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I wish that it were closer to me. Please open a location in West Valley. So, I have been frequenting the Thai spot right behind her for at least 2 years and for as long as I remember I have driven right past this place. Well one day, me and my husband were extra hungry and while we were waiting for our order at the Thai place we decided to order two tacos. They were AMAZING. The next weekend we drove to Tempe and sat inside for date night and order almost one of everything and shared. The queso is amazing! Churros are always warms and fresh. I now always order the drunken steak burrito and my husband usually gets one of the chicken burritos. We use to do the combo that comes with a taco and burrito but by the time we add the order of churros that come with two we are so full we usually have left overs. Anyway, this place is totally worth driving from Avondale for. We make special trips to or try to find reasons to be close by so we can be here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Tacos were okay, but definitely not a deal! Probably wouldn't come again, noticed that most of their business were from either postmates, grubhub and yelp"}
{"text":"The drunken steak was pretty good, the sweet taste was a little off putting at first. The fried fish taco was soggy and mushy, not what I was expecting. I will probably visit again though, to try their other meats. The monster burritos are huge! I got there around 11:45 am and it was pretty empty, but a line formed around 12:15 pm."}
{"text":"This little spot has some yummy tacos! They offer a \"taco tuesday\" special which is why I stopped in. Their tacos of the day were carnitas tacos which were a $1.99 each. However, they're very decent sizes! They also offer an order of chorizos for free with your yelp check-in! Can't beat that.  I ordered 2 chicken tinga tacos with rice & beans & a carne asada taco. My fiance ordered 2 beer battered shrimp tacos & a chorizo breakfast taco. Everything was great. We each got beans & rice for $22.00! Not bad."}
{"text":"Carne asada was not very good.. No flavor and chewy pieces :/ Though the beer battered fish taco was pretty good!  The setup/environment of this little shop was a little more modern, definite contrast from typical taco places, in a way that made me think I would get clean, healthy, delicious, and interesting food.. But I found it strangely dull instead. The food, the place, and the service. I may give it another shot since it's close to work, but I wasn't a fan."}
