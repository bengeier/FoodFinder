{"text":"This place is becoming one of my and my husband's \"go-to\" places when we want a to have a certain good meal.  The marguarita's are better than any other Mexican restaurant in town--and I think we've tried them all by now.   The one drawback is that it is sometimes too loud to have good conversation, what with the Mexican music being piped in or the live band (that may not be so great) and the constancy of the TV's scattered throughout the place.  We brought the kids one time and my son pointed out the Mexican soap opera on the TV, complete with a semi-graphic bedroom scene.  Another time they had a disturbing game show on.  If those things are no problem for you, then I recommend it for an affordable, fast, delicious dinner."}
{"text":"One word: salt! I'm not sure when this place got so bad but the last couple of times I've been, the food has been gross and too salty to eat. The service is quick, prices are cheap, but I'd rather eat elsewhere and avoid the sodium-induced bloat."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant before it moved to the current location. Now it's more expensive & the food has really gone downhill. The margaritas are so sweet; all sugar. While we'd love to have a Mex restaurant close to home, we'll drive across town to Fiesta Cafe or Dos Reales where we feel like we get better, more affordable food & drink."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars because sometimes waiting for the food takes awhile. Also, compared to Dos Reales, it just isn't as good all around.   I've been there twice, both times I've had similar dishes- a beef or beef & chicken combo fajita complete with rice, beans, and guacamole salad. The guacamole is kind of watery and there was not very much of it. The beans are okay if you mix them in with your burrito or fajita, but just looking at them on the plate, they look like they came out of a can. My dish often has had meat that has chewy or tough pieces.   My fiance ordered a combo and they got his order wrong- they didn't give him the right burrito (what he ordered came with 3 different kinds, I believe), and promptly brought him out the correct one, free of charge. The first time we went he ordered a margarita, which is more slushy-like at El Torero.  Pros: All in all, it's close to where we live so it is convenient, they were nice about the food error, and it's pretty tasty for the most part.   Cons: Sometimes pricey for the amount of food you get, chewy meat, slushy margaritas, long wait for food"}
{"text":"We love El Toro. It's one of the handful of places we go to regularly because it's a great spot for kids....loud, fast, and reasonably prized. The chips and salsa are good, but not exceptional. My favorite dish is the Mileneza, which I highly recommend. The camarones de ajo de mojo (probably didn't get that right) are also tasty and a bit healthier."}
{"text":"the only thing that saved this place from getting 1 star was their great staff and good prices because the food I had was not particularly good.  I went here on a wednesday night while my mom and step-dad were in town and they were wanting some mexican food. considering I have yet to try any mexican restaurants around town (I'm admittedly very picky and snobbish about my mexican food), I thought we'd give this place a shot because of it's reviews. first time I've been disappointed by a yelp-reviewed place...I ordered one of the veggie options and got a cheese enchilada, rice, and a bean tostada. the bean tostada was okay, but the rice was incredibly boring and flavorless compared to other mexican or spanish rice I've had. my boy got a chicken dish and said it was decent: the chicken was cooked nicely but he said it was missing something that he couldn't pinpoint. both my mom and step-dad got the mexican stir-fry with chicken and beef mix (totally not mexican at all) and liked the dish and the flavors a lot. my mom also got an original marg and I tried it and yes, it was strong, but the mix they use was overly sweet to me and I could never finish one. I like my margs with fresh lime juice and quality tequila and what she had was not that...  luckily our waiter was awesome and checked on us quite frequently to refill water and replenish the beer..."}
{"text":"I'm a Californian.  I miss Mexican food.  I miss Mexican people.  I miss hearing Spanish out loud on the street.  I miss home.  I was delighted and amused by El Torero.  First off, there were people of color inside, there was Spanish being spoken, and it seemed legit.  Of course, I then got the only gringa waitress in the place, but she was amazing, friendly, responsive, and very helpful.  The menu was hilarious as it had phonetic guides to Spanish words and reassurance that the food wouldn't be 'too spicy.'  It was a strange amalgamation of midWest gringolandia and Mexican reminiscence for me.  I loved it.  I will definitely be back.  My enchilada was good, the tamale was passable, and while the chips and salsa were not the most amazing, they more than sufficed.  Not bad.  P.S.: It's clear the staff @ El Torero are not used to having many Spanish speaking patrons, at least those with afros.  One busboy called a waiter a 'pendejo' and then looked up in horror to see me laughing.  Oh, good times, Torrero."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is moderately priced for the quantity you receive, and always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went to Champaign today to take my mom out for a birthday lunch & told her to pick a restaurant.  Now, despite the fact that she has spent a significant portion of her life living in Champaign, she generally isn't aware of directions/street names/anything more than 3 blocks away from her AND she is a kosher vegetarian, so I was a *bit* worried about where we would wind up.  Thankfully, El Torero is on her radar and has ample vegetarian offerings.  I was hesitant when the menu was brought out as it is HUGE, of the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" variety, and includes a note imploring their  guests not to hesitate when ordering as everything has been cooked to please a red-blooded American's hesitant taste-buds. Okay, not those words exactly, but you get the gist.  Living in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood in Chicago and eating authentic Mexican food at least 3 times a week, I'll tell you, I was scared...  Then they brought out the chips and salsa, always  a good way to tell what kind of a joint you are in.  The chips were probably the best I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant, honestly.  Mi madre said they made them on site.  Incredibly light, crisp, golden, nicely salted and warm - perfect. The salsa was also fantastic, good enough, in fact, that if I lived in Champaign, I'd probably come here to buy it by the quart.  Not too spicy, nice balance of pepper/tomato, incredibly fresh and very flavorful.  The guac we ordered was also very well done, nice fresh chunks of avocado, a hint of spice, and perfectly balanced with some lime. Emboldened by the great start, I decided to order with balls and got the chile verde.  My mother had one of the vegetarian platters and the fella, much to my chagrin,  ordered the \"Speedy Gonzales\" platter.  They didn't ask the usual questions (corn or flour tortillas? cilantro and onion on your taco, or do you want a ton of garbage on it as well?), when we ordered, so I wasn't entirely surprised when my verde came out with flour tortillas and the fella's taco shell was deep fried, but other than that, it was as good - if not better - as almost any Mexican food I've had anywhere.   My verde was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so, with unbelievably tender chunks of pork and a really lovely sauce of fresh peppers and herbs.  Fantastic verde, seriously!    The sides were good, the tortillas were fresh and I was the only one at the table who didn't clean their plate and that was only because I couldn't finish all of it.  Everyone loved their food and it all looked very good - I didn't get to do my usual sneak a bite as plates were cleaned so quickly!  The portions were very generous, but not break your fat pants out huge.  Huge lunch for 3 with an appetizer and drinks was only $28.00, so it's very inexpensive as well.  An extra star for being affordable and for the nice wait staff that made sure we had refills, fresh napkins, enough to drink, etc. without looming.  I'll be going to visit my mother more often, methinks, as I'm already craving more verde and salsa...."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about this place. The new location is attractive, the staff is incredibly friendly and you get your food fast. I work very near here and have gone there for lunch many times.  I am giving it three stars only because I find the food to be somewhat unremarkable. The chips are usually fresh and warm and the salsa is pleasingly spicy. I've tried quite a few different combos and to be honest they all kind of blended together after a while.  It's basically the same ingredients put on different kinds of shells or tortillas. The Mexican rice could be a bit more flavorful. I don't get the sense there is a lot of spice being added to it. Far too often it tastes like rice cooked in chicken broth.  It's a great place for a friendly atmosphere and a quick lunch. it's filling and priced well. Not a great place or to a date or visiting parents and friends out to dinner."}
{"text":"im not a big fan of el torero but my family is. which is why I'm forced to eat there. i prefer dos"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and it didn't smell like bathrooms.  Prices were very reasonable, with strong margaritas.  They got Jessie tipsy. The only downfall was the annoying woman two booths over having a breakdown with her mother and 4 year old daughter. Other than that I would love to go back again, this may supplant Dos Reales as our choice Mexican restaurant in Champaign.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I visit my friend who lives in Champaign. We went here once before a few years ago, and I had been fantasizing about their seafood platter ever since. Prices are cheap, service is always prompt and friendly, and it's a great place to go with friends.   I'm finally of legal drinking age now, so we split a huge margarita, and it was DELICIOUS. Like Sarah, I'm not a huge tequila person and I usually like my margaritas as sweet and fruity as possible, but it was very good. The perfect balance of liquor and sweetness."}
{"text":"Good service quick food..but it all seems to taste the same....always cold beer though...."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. They had super cheap food (especially for lunch) and you get a ton. The food is somewhat plain, but that's how some Mexican food is supposed to be- plus I like it better that way. I hate \"Tex-Mex\" like Chevys. I used to come here for lunch all the time."}
{"text":"El Torero is cleaner and less bathroom smelling than many of the mexican restaurants in champaign.  That does not mean that it is spotless, nor that there are no areas of the establishment in which it is not possible to be apprehended by the occasional whiff of bathroom.    The beef in my quesadilla was extraordinarily wierd.  It was a grade D- cut of beef.  However, I barely noticed because my house margarita (rocks) was TOP NOTCH.  I HATE tequila, and if I hadn't been driving I would have ordered one of their mammoth 32 oz glasses to chase the small one that I slurped down before the first basket of chips and salsa was empty.  Good marks for service.  Our chips and salsa were refilled so many times that we had enough (full) salsa bowls for everyone at the table to have their own.  We had about 16 people in our party, and our food came out rapidly, and there were no mistakes."}
