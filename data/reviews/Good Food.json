{"text":"Ate at this food cart for the first time today (at the library mall location) and OH MY GOODNESS-- its delicious. I ordered the hot breakfast wrap and it is honestly the greatest breakfast wrap I have ever eaten. It is a MUST try. I wish I could eat it every day!! There are plenty of salads for a lighter lunch and a daily specials board to keep things exciting. Vegan/vegetarian friendly :)"}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS!!!! I came here for lunch today and the people were friendly, the wait was short, and most importantly the food was amazing. I had the sweet Thai chili wrap with chicken. If I lived in Madison, I think I would eat lunch here every day."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. Their items come as a wrap or salad. I've tried several items as salads and they were all delicious, especially the Sweet Thai Chili. The soups are equally good."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices for quality!  This kind of food leaves me energized and keeps my blood sugar stable.  Super happy we have a great option when going out. Don't skip dessert."}
{"text":"I am torn regarding how to review Good Food. The ingredients are high-quality, and for the most part, the food is simple and straightforward, which I can appreciate. However, since they went low-carb, something is missing.

First, favorite menu items are no longer served (sweet Thai chili, chicken & dumpling soup, among many others...) Second, Good Food is a little too hard-core about their new, low-carb religion. I'm sure they will continue to have a following of like-minded people, or those that just don't care that much. For a long time, Good Food was the only healthy food cart option on the square, and I applaud their efforts in that realm. I just prefer to enjoy my lunch without the commentary (although I would still continue to eat there if I found it tasty, but I don't enjoy the new options).

It's too bad that a lot of the dialogue is now focused on diet and nutrition talk and battles with customers that have expressed their opinion, rather than the food. It's sort of like the Dixie Chicks, who once made an unfortunate comment about the sitting president, and ever since, they get zero play time on country radio.

I've tried several new wraps and salads. If you want fuel, Good Food is a fine option. If you want tasty food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of Good Food.  I have tried many items on the menu and have always absolutely loved them.  Favorites include the Strawberry Love salad/wrap and the Thai Chili wrap/salad. 

A healthy food truck option on the square with the highest quality, fresh ingredients is so awesome compared to a lot of food trucks that are less healthy, fried, etc.  

I look forward to days when I forget my lunch or want something different - I usually get a Good Food salad and eat outside in the summer, there is nothing better.  So tasty. 

Also, the owner is SO NICE!!!  She is a total rockstar. Service is quick so don't let the long line fool you - it speaks to how loved it is!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to food cart in Madison.  The food is delicious, the veggies crisp and tasty.

The sweet Thai chili is my favorite (as wrap or salad), but everything I've tried is good.

What soups I've had are fantastic.  My only complaint is that you need to arrive early (by noon?) if you want a chance to get some."}
{"text":"Used her as a catering company at the last minute for a large group of diverse eaters.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  I would highly recommend Good Food and would use them again anytime."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service.  My friend came specifically for the loaded baked potato soup today but they were all out...except for a spoonful at the bottom of the bowl which they dressed up nicely with fixings and gave to my friend - her day was made."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful.  Great quality, VERY consistent.  I work on the square and eat here at least once a week. I love the Greek wrap with tofu.  Fresh, fresh, fresh salad and herbs, perfect tofu, superb balance of flavors.  Never too heavily dressed and her soups are a perfect accompaniment.  

The soup is amazing!  She makes a tomato soup with cheesy croutons that are so perfectly light and decadent at the same time.  It tastes like you are having a a grilled cheese sandwich in your tomato soup.  Perfection.  

Every meal here is as good as anything you will eat around the square.  I am hoping she opens a restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"So good!  Very efficient service, good customer service.I got the Buffalo chicken wrap. It was delicious definitely going back."}
{"text":"Food trucks near the Capitol is just genius and much appreciated. Visited Good Food about half a dozen times last month. Ordered  the sweet potato pleasure wrap and salad on separate occasions, and while both are very tasty, I give the edge to the wrap. Also ordered the Waldorf chicken salad, and while it is also good, I would definitely stick with the sweet potato pleasure. My friends also really like lunchtime in Albuquerque but I did not get a chance to try. Service is very friendly and wait times weren't too bad. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is the best food cart in Madison if you're a health nut. The low carb options are amazing - great selection for folks on the keto diet. The spinach and artichoke soup is the best soup I've ever had in my life. The salad greens are always crisp, fresh, and tasty. The workers are super friendly. The food gets served quickly. I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Good Food cart.  I was a bit skeptical because the price was a bit high and I wasn't sure about the portion size.  However, based on the quality, taste, and size of the wrap I got, I think that the Good Food pricing is great.  I got the Thai wrap, and I loved that it was BURSTING with flavor, and good quality ingredients.  I asked them to put a bit extra peanut sauce in my wrap, and they kindly accommodated that.  Good food, GREAT taste, and excellent service.  I will definitely be coming here more."}
{"text":"Good Food has catered our company picnic the last two years.  Cannot recommend their catering highly enough- rave reviews!!!"}
{"text":"Best lunch cart ever.  Daily specials are always interesting, can get everything as a wrap or a salad on amazing greens (no iceberg here).  Add chips and a drink for cheap, and walk away with a super fresh lunch for under $10.  If you walk up, and there is a line--it is worth the wait, they are pretty quick.  (ALWAYS good fruit cups, by the way, never a waste of $)"}
{"text":"having sweet thai chilli wrap. It's really awesome taste is so good, portion is a bit big for me but I can divided for next meal hahahah. I surely go back !"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to order from Good Food. I went to the location at Library mall. There wasn't a long wait to order, and my food took 5 minutes to make. 

It's fall y'all, and Good Food knows how to play on my comfort food heart strings. I ordered a cup of Cuban black bean soup served with guacamole and crispy tortilla strips AND the chicken buffalo bleu cheese wrap combo for $8.50. 

The soup was sublime. Chunky tomatoes, whole black beans, lotsa caramelized onion, and plenty of paprika for a smoky flavor. Plus it's vegan! The wrap was cold, would have preferred warm. Either way, blue cheese buffalo chicken was on point. And I appreciated the ample lettuce thrown in. 

\"More than good, they're great!\" - Tony the Tiger"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I got the Greek Wrap with pesto tofu (hold the olives, please!); delicious! $5 for the wrap, $2 more for two sides and a drink. They seem to be emphasizing organic and natural food and they gave me a compostable plastic bag to hold everything when I asked. 

Better value and food than Subway (the next closest place to get a sanwich) hands down."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! There are several food carts to choose from around the Capitol and this one by far is the BEST! Whether you want a wrap, salad or soup, vegetarian, gluten-free or even vegan they have what you are hungry for! The Black bean hummus wrap/salad is my favorite. They also have sides to pick from. If you want something salty they have baked chips or if you are looking for something a little more healthy they have fresh fruit. Don't forget the afternoon snack and get one of their \"Just Baked Cookies\". There usually is a long line but that is just because they are so popular for lunch! If you have an office luncheon I would recommend their catering! Next time you are in Madison around the capitol square looking for a healthy tasty lunch try the Good Food Cart. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Fresh and delicious! Nothing is bad on the menu! 
Catering is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious and FAST! Unique flavors on traditional wraps. I love the homemade balsamic vin on the greek hummus wrap. And you must Try the thai tofu - the peanut sauce is so good."}
{"text":"There's a reason there is always a line that basically extends inside of the Walgreens at lunch time. I grabbed a beet salad with goat cheese, walnuts, chicken, and balsamic vinaigrette, while my boyfriend opted for the thai chicken wrap. We were looking for an impromptu picnic lunch on the square, and felt like trying a new food cart (Banzo has been the go to in the past).

Good Food does not disappoint. The ingredients are very fresh; there was no slightly browned iceberg lettuce in my salad, only freshly torn bright green Bibb, the beets were perfectly roasted and complimented with the slight tang of the goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The walnuts provided a nice crunch to round out the textural experience of the salad. The thai chicken wrap was excellent as well - not over dressed like most wraps, with a generous (but not oversized) portion of chicken. The breading portion of the wrap didn't overwhelm either - the focus was on the fresh vegetables, chicken, and spices. 

It's  bit pricier than some of the other food carts, and the portions are not overwhelming - but the quality is worth it. The staff is very cheery too - maybe one of the reasons lunch tasted so great was that the girl working seemed so happy to help us. 

Having read reviews now that Good Food delivers, I will definitely be keeping this in mind as an option for a delivery dinner that isn't swimming in grease."}
{"text":"Bravo Chopped salad was refreshing and light but still filling. Good size and great ingredients!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and have never had anything that wasn't delicious. And the staff are super-friendly. It's always crowded, but they're pretty quick considering the crowd. My favorites are the Strawberry Love Salad and the Buffalo Chicken Salad. Their soups are delightful as well."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!

The food is good when you actually get what you order. Twice now I have ordered a meal that was supposed to have tofu and no meat. The first time, my wrap was made with chicken instead of tofu, and the second time, bacon was added to my wrap.

For a cart that specifically states that they have vegetarian and vegan fare, this is unacceptable. If you go here, check your food before you start eating."}
{"text":"Food is pure!  Overall good stuff, but the wraps I ordered were not well put together / fell apart and much of the ingredients listed on the menu where not in the wrap.  Additionally, I ordered 4 wraps and it was impossible to tell what was what with just a few initials on them. Food cart or not definitely, not the 5 star review I read on Yelp."}
{"text":"Everything they make is incredible. I've been consuming gallons of their soup. Seriously, some of the best soup around. Last week I tried the Chicken Tortilla soup, and it blew my mind. Plus, the people who work that cart are super friendly. I've only been to the cart near the Walgreen's on Cap Square, but I reckon the food is equally delicious at their other location.

Worth the praise. Top-notch, y'all."}
{"text":"The first time I walked by the Good Food cart and noticed a swift moving line and a small crowd of onlookers salivating I took notice. After briefly studying the menu I opted for the Gourmet Greek with hummus. A few steps and a couple of bites later I came to understand the scene outside of the little red cart.

I've been back numerous times since that first visit and have tried most of the menu. Everything is outstanding, the price is right, fast and consistent and most importantly the proprietor has mad people skills, and always smiling.

Hat's off to you Good Food!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was tasty, but I got the chicken fajita bowl and it had very little chicken.  So I am docking them a star for that."}
{"text":"Turkey club wrap is amazing!  Always extremely fresh tomatoes and the bacon is the icing on the cake!  I have done ranch and honey mustard which are both delicious :)"}
{"text":"Heck yeah! This little food cart is sooo delicious! The Sweet Thai Chili wrap is definitely worth trying! Also, the soups are fantastic to warm you on a cold day. There is always a line, so get there early. Also, you can order a super huge container to take some home with you! The Vegan Dahl is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today and my oh my how delicious it was! My first time at the cart and I ordered the sweet thai chili wrap with tofu. That sweet and spicy peanut sauce is absolutely swingin'!!  I very much appreciated the quality of ingredients, making my lunch especially fresh. My  companion had the turkey club wrap and said it was very tasty as well.  If you can't make it to the square, they do offer delivery through the Mr. Delivery service.  Make this your next lunch destination. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, the wraps here are AMAZING! We got the california wrap with tofu and it was absolutely delicious! Next time I'm in Madison, I'm definitely coming back here to try their other wraps!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, I go to this food cart so often they know me by name. When the weather turns cold they have soup in addition to their wraps and salads. I've liked everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Only had a few minutes for lunch when we arrived in Madison and found Good Food on yelp. The reviews are spot on! You know it's a good food truck when it's the only one with a line. Loved the sweet potato salad (added grilled chicken) and was impressed that a fruit bowl (with good fruit- not just melon) was only $2! Definitely recommend and hope to make it back while we are in town."}
{"text":"Everything I've had so far has been delicious. I like the salads better than the wraps. The salads are large, and I really appreciate the fact that they don't skimp on toppings.  My favorites are the Sweet Potato Pleasure salad and Sweet Thai Chili salad. I haven't tried their soups yet, but I will soon!"}
{"text":"I have seen them on the Capitol Square many times. But today I spotted them and got my wrap from next to the Memorial Library location. Usually no matter where I saw them, it always has the longest line in queue. I just don't usually like to spend time in the line unless it's five stars for sure. I got lucky out today without any wait, so immediately jumped in. 

Tried their special today it's a pesto bomb of freshness. I had the choice of chicken, so full of fresh vegs in a wrap. I cannot be happier and same time feel great and healthy, instead of guilty pleasure at most of the other food trucks. I totally recommend it for both taste and health option."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison last summer for an internship in the square and luckily found this place. Good Food has by far the best lunches I have ever had, not even exaggerating. I still routinely crave their wraps and salads and this place is on my list of many reasons why I would consider moving back. Sweet Thai Chili Wrap how I miss you so :'("}
{"text":"Good Food always has a line--even when the weather's not greatest. Now that's a good sign! Is it worth the wait? YES.

Their salads and wraps are filled with a variety of fresh (and local) ingredients, different flavors for every palate, and all for a good price. There are generally six different salads/wraps to choose from, chicken or tofu, and the soups vary. They also offer different combinations along with chips, beverages and something sweet to top your lunch off! Staff are friendly, and personalize every order by taking your name and calling it when ready. You would think all food carts do this, but they don't. 

I love coming here for a clean meal and have tried all their salads (not huge on soups, mainly on cold/rainy days!). Today, the weather is good so you can bet that line was back by Walgreens. Regardless, orders were collected quickly, and after getting mine in, my Fajitas in Albuquerque salad was ready in 5 minutes. Altogether it took about 8 minutes total. This is important because this leaves you time for quick walk around the square, or to find a place to sit and eat. 

****Hidden perk--their salad containers are perfect to re-use, AND, they're microwaveable. It says so right in the lid! ;P"}
{"text":"Note: this is for the library mall cart. One of my favorite food carts, especially when I'm looking for something fast and healthy! Everything on the menu can be made as a wrap or salad, I've always picked the salad. One thing I love is that they don't skimp out on any ingredients, including the meat! Everything is always fresh and tasty. I've tried the pad Thai salad and LOVED this! So flavorful compared to other on-the-go salads. I just wish I could add some hot sauce to it! Would definitely recommend if you're in a rush, but don't want something fried."}
{"text":"So many great healthy food options here! Always new fresh and delicious soups daily. My favorite wrap is the Thai peanut with tofu."}
{"text":"Went here after I saw the reviews on yelp. The food truck lady was very helpful with helping me make a choice. I ordered the Greek wrap. I was really looking forward to it but it turned out to be very salty, the tofu was tasteless and olives tasted weird (I am big fan of olives and tasted a ton of variety of them). May be the food didn't suit my palate. You could give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh food, heavy on the veggies (which I loved!). I had the Thai Wrap which was very flavorful.  Good balance of sweet and spicy, but not overpowering.  Very fast and friendly service.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The temperature on my car's dashboard read 97 degrees as I pulled up to the capitol square hungry for lunch to go.  I definitely wasn't looking for a steaming bowl of chili.  I stumbled upon good food for no other reason that it happened to be close to where I parked my car.  Browsing the menu, it hit me how delicious a wrap or a salad would be on this scorching hot summer day.  

The thai tofu sounded excellent and a woman standing next to me was chowing down a wrap filled with a very generous portion of the stuff.  I asked her how it was and she started raving about how much she loves the thai tofu and gets it all the time.  She loved it so much that she couldn't even take a break from eating, instead describing it to me as she went at it.  But, I was torn.  A salad called strawberry love was calling my name.  I had to try it, and let me just say, I'm in love with strawberry love.  This was hands down one of best salads I have ever had in my life.  I was nervous about a salad from a cart given the searing temperatures, but the mixed greens were crisp and fresh.   Now, a salad can only be a great meal if it is a) big, and b) has lots of stuff in it.  This one certainly fit the bill.  The salad completely filled the large bowl it came in along with my stomach once the bowl was empty.    Generous portions of feta cheese, sliced strawberries, and crunchy roasted almonds meant this was no boring salad.  I elected not to have red onions.  There were several protein options, and I went with the chicken, which was piled high on top.  Dressing was a house made vinaigrette and it was excellent.  You won't find something with this much flavor on a shelf at woodman's.  I requested very light dressing and to have the salad tossed.  This was done correctly and quickly with a smile.  I got all of this for about $7 and they even take credit card!

As I ate my salad, the owner, Melanie emerged from her trailer to talk to me about her food.  It's obvious that she is passionate about what she is doing.  A lot of businesses use buzzwords like local, organic, natural, etc. for marketing purposes.  For Melanie, it's not just a buzzword; it's a way of life.  She knows about the farmers where she sources her produce.  She cares about the miles her food travels not only because of its impact on the environment but also because lettuce that travels less is crisper; locally sourced strawberries picked at the peak of perfection instead of ripened in a refrigerator car are sweeter.  The chickens themselves, the farmers who raise them, the employees who prepare them, and the customers who eat them; Melanie cares about her food chain every step of the way.  It goes way beyond mere marketing.  The end result is a cart that has a misnomer name.  Good Food isn't good; it's spectacular!  I will certainly be back very soon (I still gotta try that thai tofu!) and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who asked."}
{"text":"Good Food is always there when I need 'em. There salads are out of this world! They are jam-packed with ingredients, and could easily make for two meals if you have any self control. I do not possess this kind of self control, and the nice part about scarfing down something from Good Food is that you don't feel regretful and disgusting afterwards. The prices are reasonable given the large portion size, and the fact that protein (chicken or tofu) is included in the price. 

My favorite has been the Lunchtime in Albuquerque salad (w/chicken) - the dressing included is incredible! For a food cart, their service is quick and friendly. One of the best food cart options in Madison - be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"Best wrap I've ever had!! You will not regret going here. I wish it was by Library Mall more often though!"}
{"text":"I don't dole out 5 stars very often, and even rarer for only having one item off their menu--but it's worth your time and money to come to this food stand if you're a UW student, staff or faculty member.

The food is fresh, good, and healthy without sacrificing anything on taste. The woman who took my order today was lively and nice--exactly what you'd want your service to be like.

I had a honey mustard chicken wrap and it's a very simple dish. Literally, just some lettuce, some cucumbers (or pickles--couldn't tell the difference), and some chicken with honey mustard in a wrap. But the wrap was a good portion size (especially for $5), filling, and delicious! The chicken was incredibly moist and tender, which made it all the tastier.

I'll most definitely be back. Especially as someone who wants to lose some weight, Good Food is great for that quick to-go food without feeling guilty.

Just a head's up though: Good Food only takes cash and is open from 11am-2pm. But if you can get in during that time, sosososo worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome! Cute little food cart parked outside Walgreens on the square. Had the Thai chicken chili wrap. Very good. Crisp veggies and tasty sauce. My wife had the Caesar wrap which was very good as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Good Food food cart should be renamed to \"The Best Food\" food cart. This small food cart has left a big impression not just on me but everyone in the consistent 10+ person line (which moves fast - don't be intimidated) waiting for some of the best food to be offered on the streets of Madison. 

This is fresh food at its finest. Go ahead and ask me how fresh... I'm glad you asked. This food is so fresh you'd think they pick the vegetables only after receiving each order. It impresses me every time. A small food cart that produces extremely fresh food that tastes amazing - what Good Food does puts many Madison restaurants (with full kitchens) to shame. 

My go to is the Sweet Thai Chili wrap. I always ask for half chicken and half tofu and extra sauce. Trust me when I say the sauce is very, very good. Like \"addicting drug\" good. You'll want more so ask for more right away. I don't think there can be \"too much\" sauce so don't worry (just thank me later). When your order is ready you'll hear your name called like an angel singing \"Hallelujah\" and handed a foil wrapped wrap that is solid. The weight is pretty stunning - you'll know right away that this was money well spent. 

What's in it? Crunch, sweet, spicy, zip, fresh and a bunch of other flavored. This single wrap has changed my outlook on wraps. It's the William Shakespeare and Leonardo da Vinci of wraps. It's a gift to the throngs of people walking the streets looking for Good Food!!!

Get to the Good Food food cart sooner instead of later, wait in line and prepare yourself to dive into what I believe is the single food cart that leads the Madison food cart movement!"}
{"text":"The healthiest yet often most delicious food cart in Madison. They are out there snow or rain... with a beautiful smile handing out delectable wraps and salads. Melanie, the owner, just opened up a deliciously innovative new low carb cafe out on Cottage Grove road that is surely worth a visit as well."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite food cart. I've tried the Thai Chili wrap and the Sweet Potato salad. I was impressed both times. Both were packed full of flavorful ingredients and I felt I got my money's worth. The thing I loved the most was how fresh everything tastes.  Good, healthy ingredients that don't taste processed. I will be back for more. Keep up the good work, Good Eats!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from outside, but let me assure you, you will love the food.  I am extremely opinionated and stubborn when it comes to the quality of a meal, and this place exceeded my standards.  Extremely fresh and outstanding taste."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place but then they changed their menu (as of Feb 2017).  If you loved their sweet chili wrap (what they were known for) - too bad, they dont offer it anymore.  In fact, their menu is totally different and not in a good way.  They still have the wraps but they are uninspired (for instance, they replaced pesto with greek - anyone can make a greek wrap...) and the flavor is \"meh\".  I've been back a couple of times in order to try all their wraps (trying to be optimistic - maybe I hadnt tried the right one).  Their service is still great but you cant eat service.  What I would give for one of their sweet chili wraps...."}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup was beyond incredible.

The staff was friendly, efficient, and good-looking."}
{"text":"DAT SWEET THAI CHILI WRAP DOE. I don't know what they put in that sauce, but it may as well be crack. 

Whole grain tortilla. Baked tofu, Mixed veggies (greens, tomato, red onion, cucumber, shredded carrots). Fresh basil. Fresh cilantro. Sweet chili sauce and peanut sauce. IT'S LIKE A 1980'S RAVE IN MY MOUTH.

Bonus fact: Good Food delivers. I don't even have to get out of my pajamas to enjoy this deliciousness. Score."}
{"text":"When I first saw the menu, I thought, ok- these are things I have in my fridge, and I could wrap them all up myself.  But then I ate my wrap (some tofu, crispy tortilla chips inside wrap) and I was blown away.  The prices are all great and everything I've had has exceeded my expectations.

The only downside: no location to go to ... :)"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE this food cart!!!   Super tasty and healthy food always served with a smile."}
{"text":"Tried the california wrap special today. Very good food and the wrap was perfect. 
Tasted it with Tofu, good choices of meat as well. 
They did take credit card payments., but think most of the other customers paid cash."}
{"text":"I have one word. Mmmmmmmmmmm. 

Their name doesn't resemble its name. It should be OMG THATS AN AMAZING CEASAR WRAP Food.

CEASAR is my favorite, but it's all good."}
{"text":"Best food cart in the city.  I am so lucky that it is parked right outside my building downtown.  Sweet Thai Chili Wrap sandwich is AMAZING!  The soups are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Love me some GOOD FOOD!  Never had a bad meal from GF.  The prices are quite reasonable with the amount/quality of ingredients you receive.  Highly recommend the Sweet Thai Chili Wrap.

The line can get long, but the service is quick and ALWAYS delivered with a smile!"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!  This place is amazing!  Super tasty and healthy too!  The sweet thai chili wrap is AMAZING but so is everything.  There's always a line but that's a good sign.  I wish I worked downtown so I could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"I'm with Izzy D! 
(Natch.) 
Their Sweet Thai Chili Wrap is probably one of my favorite things on the menu (when temps are warmer and they're not serving chicken and dumpling soup that is). That sauce... ohhhhhhhhhhh that sauce! I sort of want to ask them for extra so I can dip my delicious wrapped pleasure into a big bowl of the tangy sweet stuff, but I don't want to take too much if it off their hands, nobody else would be able to enjoy it.

I go sans red onion (you can pretty much personalize any wrap, any salad, anyway) which means my whole grain wrap packs fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, chicken (though you can sub tofu), cilantro, probably some things I'm forgetting because ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS THAT SAUCE! It's delicious, and I feel good about eating it. 

Now as part of their Power Lunch option, you can get a smaller version of your favorite wrap or salad with a side of fruit for $7. That's sort of insane when you consider it's great fruit. Not lame ass melon, but raspberries, grapes, blackberries, watermelon, pineapple...! 

Don't be afraid if you spot the cart and the line looks long, they move quick! I think I waited 6 minutes today for my lunch, not bad when you consider it was prepared fresh to order with stellar ingredients. Add to this the fact that they deliver, and there's really no reason to not give them a whirl sometime soon. 

Lovely people and flavorful food. 

Good food!"}
{"text":"Yum! 

Sad that I am now moving from Madison in a matter of weeks and just had the \"Good Food\" food cart. I wish I took a picture of the salad I just demolished because it was delicious! I believe they also have a restaurant located downtown. If you're tired of the same ol' chicken/rice/veggie routine that most of the other carts offer, go ahead and try this one out!"}
{"text":"I tried the Good Food cart at New Belgium's Brewery's Clips of Faith event at Olin Park. I have to say, Good Food was great!

I tried the Sweet Thai Chili wrap. As other Yelpers have mentioned, it's definitely worth trying. Sometimes I'm wary of wraps because they can be too dry and have too much tortilla, but this wrap had a nice amount filling and sauce, and I didn't have to rip off half the tortilla like I usually do with a wrap. It was very flavorful and I could tell that the ingredients were very fresh. The addition of fresh basil leaves was a nice surprise! 

I will definitely check out Good Food again!"}
{"text":"Good Food is amazing! We need more places that realize that customers WANT to eat healthily. Good Food provides healthy and tasty food at a great price and in a convenient manner- right off the street! The owner is awesome and is always working to make new tasty creations for her customers. The ingredients are always fresh and local too! I had a tasty salad and my boyfriend grabbed a bag of trail mix. There are always wraps available and new soups all the time, yummy!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Good Food.  They're consistent and the food is fresh, well portioned, and fast.  They can be busy as all hell around noon, but they're worth the wait."}
{"text":"February 2017, Good Food introduced a new low-carb  menu.  Pre-2017 reviews may be obsolete.

The Albuquerque fajitas have nice Pico de Gallo. The fajitas liquid sometimes disintegrates the wrap, so I often order fajitas as a salad.  The fajitas are better without the creamy (ranch?) dressing.  The beef entree comes with enjoyable horseraddish that has gotten tastier lately.  If you want something quite mild, most of the flavor in the Pad Thai comes from the peanuts.  I like the Pad Thai better without the creamy dressing. 

Strawberry Love is back!

Many excellent options for vegetarians and vegans.  Meat-eaters will appreciate excellent inputs and very good prep.

I have eaten here since entrees were $6+change (now $8-$9+change).  This outstrips inflation and others' price increases.  (Ingreedient quality is at an all-time high too.)  If you want healthy food, they do a good job and the competition seems thin-to-nill.  These folks work really hard and they really want you to be happy and healthy.  Ask and ye shall receive.  (Just don't ask how much sugar was in the old Sweet Thai Chili sauce.)"}
{"text":"Love this cafe and their food cart. It's very rare to find a restuarant that caters to the low-carb community, and they do an exceptional job. Wish they would open a location on the west side, as it is quite a drive from Verona."}
{"text":"Super nice catering service.  The food was great and perfect for a summer meal.  Their barbecue is awesome and offered a tofu option as well.  The squash curry soup was super delicious, as well as the side salads and deserts.  Would be great for any summer event with a medium-large sized group."}
{"text":"Yes, very delicious. After checking out the beautiful state capital building, we headed to the food trucks. I'd read the reviews so ordered the sweet and spicy Thai chicken wrap with extra sauce. It was yummy for sure, and fresh. Very good. They had a special that was a Latin wrap, and my hubby snarfed it down. It was lunchtime, busy as heck, and these folks just cranked the food out as efficiently as anything. So read the rest of the reviews and stop by this place. Worth it for sure!"}
