{"text":"I don't give one stars and I don't give five stars. Life is all about moderation and I coast by somewhere in the middle. That being said; if I were a more temperamental person lowesville cafe would be rocking a one star. 

Let me set the scene; Sunday mid-morning so as you can imagine the place was pretty crowded. Right in the middle of the venn-diagram of the \"skipped church\" and \"just getting out of church\" crowd (you can imagine which circle I'm in) I was lucky enough to snag a table for me and two of my closest compatriots (my parents). The food took a little longer to arrive then was necessary, even factoring in the busyness of the day and while I was underwhelmed with my order (the gyro)  the other members of my party were pleased with their food. So maybe that one's on me for ordering a gyro. Service however, was terrible. I had difficulties ever getting our waitress' attention and had to practically beg for a refill and additional napkins. Shortly after finishing our meal we noticed we neglected to receive the biscuit that was supposed to accompany one of our meals. Our waitress informed us they were out of biscuits (on a Sunday?!) and dismissively told us it would be a while. A while turned into an additional 20 minutes of waiting at which point we requested a biscuit update and were coldly told esstentially \"it'll be ready when it's ready\". To top it off, my meal was more than I anticipated and had to go request they review my ticket and oh wouldn't you know it, I was overcharged. 

I understand I went at an extremely busy time and that mistakes happen, however I feel we could've easily been placated and overlooked the negatives if our waitress didn't treat us with the disdain one shows when discovering they stepped in a piece of gum that's now stuck to the bottom of their shoe. There was no excuse for the pisspoor attitude of the wait staff and general \"whatever\" treatment they doled out. Needless to say I will not be returning. Also, never got my biscuit."}
{"text":"Moved to the area around the first of the year, so we just dicovered this place over the weekend when looking for breakfast. We had a great experience. It was very shocking that my teenager couldn't finish everything on his plate. The mancakes are huge, and the sausage links are wonderful. Good coffee too. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just a little hole in the wall but, good food and good staff. Try it once and you'll will become a regular."}
{"text":"My friends and I had breakfast at this restaurant Sunday.  The exterior of the establishment is by no means an indicator of the quality of food or experience.   The omelette and potatoes were generous in portion and delicious.  Service was superb.  A good old home country feel.  Inexpensive too!"}
{"text":"We have been to Lowesville Cafe a couple times for breakfast. Good ol' American breakfast they served: perfectly cooked bacon; good biscuit and gravy (country gravy not sausage gravy); good coffee; I tried hush brown casserole for the first time in my life here and it was not bad. 

Tried lunch once and it was pedestrian. 

Service was friendly. It's always busy on weekends (yes they do open on Sundays)."}
{"text":"Best tasting breakfast food in Denver , pancakes are delicious and we always find ourselves smiling and satisfied with the food here. They could use an addition to the building with the popularity they're gaining."}
{"text":"Family owned local HOT spot. Stays pretty busy the whole time it's open but service and food is good and consistent. Home fries are not what you're expecting. They are large chopped, boiled, then browned with crispy edges from grill. Yummy hunks begging for lots of ketchup and Texas Pete. Grilled pork chops one of my favorites!! Bacon not cooked to death. Perfectly crips but chewy!!! HUGE, fluffy pancakes. Breakfast served open to close. Can't go wrong with lunch either. If you haven't been, you're missing a local love."}
{"text":"Straight ahead southern cafe comfort food!  If you leave here hungry then you don't understand comfort food. I had a ton of fried catfish with a mountain of crispy fries plus green beans and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"It's not too far up the road from where I live, and it makes for a nice outing. So far I've only done breakfast there, but what I've had has been mighty tasty (honestly some of the vest bacon I've had. It's so flavorful). The prices are easy on the wallet, the service is quick and polite, the atmosphere is homey, and the signs on the walls are bound to get a chuckle or two. Took my parents here a couple of times and my father has fallen in love with their breakfast sausage links."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food,  but good service.  The place always seems to be packed for breakfast though. The parking lot is a big potholed mess."}
{"text":"Great service from very nice people and real food is served."}
{"text":"My family likes to support locally owned business versus the big chains so we frequently go here and love the the friendly staff. The food is very good and speaks volumes in regards to the quality/quantity for the price. You will enjoy this place not only for the food but also the customer service. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Never had eaten here. Stopped driving by one day. Expect country cooking. Servings were large. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good country people along with good country eats!  This is my 4th time there and they have never let me down"}
{"text":"I've been here several of times and it you come in an off time you might even get served.

Today was typical. We walked in and they were busy. We had the odd party of five which is always difficult. Told a 5 minutes wait.

15 minutes later we left.

They only have three set up for a party of five, all of which were taken. Two of the three were occupied. At the same time, there were several tables for four which over time became vacant. My wife asked it we could not add a table at the end and told no. End of story.

End of story. After 15 minutes, we left and drove 5 minutes to Westlake. They did not have a table for party of 5 either but had the same table of 4 which they could put a chair at the end and have lunch.

We did , no inconvenience and we enjoyed the company of our friends

Can not cope with the ebb and flow of customers and would suggest that there are options"}
{"text":"Place is a gem if you love southern homestyle cooking need to try this place if you are in the area right off of old 16 a new 16 area, owners have been cooking here in Charlotte for over 20+ years very polite staff these people know what they are doing highly recommend stoping in only open for breakfast and lunch that's how busy these folks are"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after a long visit to Mike's Growers Outlet. The catfish was light and flaky, and the fish pita was fresh and so delicious! Would love to go back and try their breakfasts sometime, soon! Awesome service, too."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast at the Lowesville Cafe and it was amazing!!!  It is under a new owner and they have redone the entire place.  It looks amazing inside and out.  The food was absolutely fresh and delicious!!  They cook everything from scratch and it was delivered to my place at the counter piping hot!!  The sweet tea was fantastic.  It's such a cool place!  Please plan your route to check out this great place!  It's perfectly rustic with an incredibly friendly staff full of Southern charm!  Do yourself a favor and do what I did...plan your day around a visit to the Lowesville Cafe!!"}
{"text":"I visit this establishment about once a week.  While you can spend your time and money in other locally owned places in Denver, I will not!  Have ate numerous different menu items (breakfast and lunch) and none have failed.  Everything I have tried has been top quality and plenty of it!  The staff is always friendly and prompt.  It doesn't get better for home cooking in Denver!"}
{"text":"The food was average and the place was so noisy you had to yell at the person seated next to you. The staff was friendly and the service was fairly quick so it has that going for it."}
{"text":"The best little breakfast spot around. We have eaten here for years and nothing has changed. Just a small town restaurant with good food and quick service."}
{"text":"By far the best kept secret in Denver! So much food for the money! When my mother in law is in town she goes here at least 2 times! Every time we go doesn't matter the time of day we always order breakfast! Great place!! Need more like this in Denver!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant with great breakfast food.   I've not tried lunch but the breakfast is really good.  

Pancakes and French toast are fantastic.  The home fries are a real stand out and the hash brown casserole on the weekends is the bomb!  

Awesome local gem!"}
{"text":"Wrong address listed here that is just off the highway. Don't waste your time trying to find"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Food was good home cooking and lots of it. Had to get a to-go box. I will eat my mancakes for breakfast tomorrow. This place was full when we got there. Great local spot."}
{"text":"Great local spot with friendly staff!  
One Saturday morning my company needed to have a sales meeting and we decided to have it over breakfast. I looked on yelp and found the Lowesville caf√© and decided to give it a shot. The LC did not disappoint! There was eight of us so I was worried about seating. But they gave us our own corner and two servers. The food was delicious and pretty inexpensive, and servers were on top of their game.  If you're looking for a nice country breakfast or lunch I would recommend you stopping bye."}
{"text":"After living in the area for 20 years, we finally stopped to eat here. My wife and I had breakfast here 9/22/15. The food was ok and hot and priced right, but I had a gravy biscuit that I was not impressed with. The sausage patty was nothing to brag about either. Maybe other breakfast items or the lunch menu might be better. Service was attentive and our coffee cups were kept full.
Overall it wasn't bad, I think my wife liked it better than I did, to me there are just other places that I prefer over here that I think are much better."}
{"text":"Where do I start!!! Extremely poor service, staff doesn't appear to be happy and friendly, food was luke warm, took about 45 mind to get food (for 2 people), no drink refills, wait staff disappears, numerous empty tables with a 30 min wait (people walking in the door and being told kitchen is behind and at least a 30 min wait for service).  Was not impressed and won't be back.  We were told that everything about this place was great - no so much!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lowesville Cafe a couple of times for breakfast and it is amazing! They offer generous portions at a reasonable price, and it has all the flavor and presentation that you would expect from a great country diner. There are a few other breakfast spots in Denver North Carolina area but Lowesville Cafe is by far the best!"}
