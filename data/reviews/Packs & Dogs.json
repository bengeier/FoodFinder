{"text":"Great hot dogs, friendly staff. Well worth the trip up the incline."}
{"text":"I go here like at least every week and their beer selection and hotdogs are awesome. One of my favorites places to just relax. However, I feel like lately the freshness of the ingredients hasn't been the best. So just watch for that. Other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"It's true that there are not a lot of options on Mt. Washington but I feel like this review is still valid. The beer selection is good (great if you consider the location) but don't be surprised if you end up with a larger tab than expected or a very expensive six pack. Very few beers in the cooler and none of the drafts are priced.   We don't have any problem spending money on good beer but if Pack and Dogs is looking to deliver a surprise, the surprise is always bad. I don't think that it's asking too much to know the price of the cooler or draft beer and I don't know of any other six packs to go places that don't label the cost of their bottles. The product is good but I'm confused by the delivery."}
{"text":"One year after my previous review... I have to say... Nothing has changed.  The menu is HALF competent (hot dogs and fries), and half freezer garbage.  I dare you to get chicken fingers or a steak hoagie that isn't frozen Tyson or Steak-ums.  The business itself seems to think it's more important than it is... Sell overpriced six-packs or overpriced frozen sandwiches, but don't try to tell us that you're special."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs just kinda expensive at $3.50+ a piece. The beer selection is great although to make your own 6 pack or buy singles you will be spending a minimum of $3 a beer depending on the type. That's $18 at minimum for a 6 pack. Talk about highway robbery. One should never spend over $7 for a 6 pack unless it's imports or craft beer. It would be a great place if it was cheaper!!"}
{"text":"Quite simply Packs and Dogs is a unique experience.....Hundreds of beers, and the dogs were awesome...Had the Bloodhound, wow,...The Kielbasa Bulldog is what a Pittsburgh food in tube form should taste like! Place is clean and funky welcoming. Mark who runs the place is first class ....Catch the view of the city and walk on down to Packs & Dogs tell em' the Jersey Boys sent you, special surprise awaits...Can't wait to get visit again..."}
{"text":"Surprised by the bottle selection and draft list. Prices are steep but aren't they everywhere? To get a good 6 pack local, this place is recommended."}
{"text":"Living the neighborhood, this is such a little gem that I try to support the business in hopes it never, ever goes away. The hot dogs are excellent -- as somebody else mentioned, not all hot dogs are created equal! These are quality dogs -- with the all beef, natural casings available. The natural casings deliver that wonderful snap as bite into it. The fries are also hot and fresh. And the beer! Oh, the beer! So many wonderful varieties. I can't even begin to describe what wonders their beer cases hold. Go. Eat. Drink. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and I loved it! Great selection of beers and the food was good. I am definitely planning on coming again."}
{"text":"If you want a huge selections of beers, and deliciously unhealthy food to pair it with, packs & dogs is it. I love this place for late night grub or grabbing a tasting six pack of 6 beers I've never had before."}
{"text":"A dive in the all the best ways! Pretty great dogs, awesome fries, and build-your-own beer packs! Cheap and easy. Right across from a parking lot on the Mount."}
{"text":"I ordered a italian hoagie.. finally because it took forever to place my order ( not even busy).. i ordered it \"hot\" an i got microwaved meat on a cold bun....probably not the best or even good... Kinda sad about it because i heard great things...."}
{"text":"FABULOUS beer selection and great sandwiches. To top it off the customer service is superb."}
{"text":"Me and a lot of my friends used to make consistent trips to Packs and Dogs because of the good value in their beer....despite it being about 25 miles away. Up to very recently, you could get MANY good beers for $2.25. Now, they raised their prices nearly 40% (!) to $3.00 for their cheapest beers.....looks like there is not much reason to go there as frequently as in the last few years. Oh, well, thanks for the good past few years Packs & Dogs.....you will be missed!"}
{"text":"Come here to pick up beer. Don't come here expecting any semblance of customer service, because you won't find it. New ownership has no clue what that is."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed...but stick to the hot dogs and side dishes/appetizers.  The hot dogs were better than some of the \"best\" featured on the Food Network.  I had the \"blood hound;\" it was very good, but it wasn't even the best at the table (the Pitt Bull was).  The fried pickles (with tiger sauce), pub fries (with yeungling cheese sauce), and the loaded mac n cheese are all highly recommended.    Service was also very good. We had a party of 13 including 8 kids and did not want for anything.  Beer selection was also superb.  I'd stay away from the sandwiches though. The chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak were mediocre at best.  Overall, very happy though. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sheraton next to Station Square on a Saturday night. My husband and I wanted a quick bite and some good craft brews. We took the incline up to Mt. Washington and walked less than two blocks to Packs and Dogs. We had some delicious hotdogs and some great beers on tap. The employees were friendly and helpful and the place was very, very clean. We ended up getting a mixed six pack to go as well. This is a nice little place that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We came in for some beers and to watch the NCAA tournament. The place was great. The beer selection is awesome, especially in bottles and cans. The staff were great and Kris went above and beyond to find the beers we wanted. It's not your typical sports bar or beer store, but I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Damn good dogs and cold beer. What's not to like."}
{"text":"Such a great find! Great food, huge selection of craft beers, and an amazing atmosphere. Hot dogs are fantastic and well portioned, whether you're looking for a light snack or full meal, Packs & Dogs has it! Great place for watching Sunday football games!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Big surprise to say the least.  Place looks questionable for a family type environment, but walked inside and our perception changed!  Our kids had a great meal.  For the adult, the beer selection is just crazy.... so many to choose it is difficult my wife and I loved it!!!!  Great experience.  Food was very good, place was super clean and friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed this place. Good hotdogs with various toppings. Huge beer selection!!! Really, really nice staff! Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Is it a beer-to-go place? Is it all three? Yes, and it is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, great food and fast delivery. Never knew about this place until I moved up to Mount Washington. Glad I found it."}
{"text":"Packs and dogs used to be my go-to spot for a beer or food delivery.  The past few months I've tried calling to order but was unable to get through to anyone. Tonight I stopped for a drink and meal and to dig into why their phones were not working. After asking our server what had happened with the delivery and phones, I was informed that they no longer answer phones because too many customers cancel orders. This seemed a bit ridiculous to me, but I really wish they would have at least updated their site or online menu to reflect this (delivery is still an option on their website). I really wish old ownership was restored so food  and service were back to normal."}
{"text":"Service was slow. I asked a server what the ABV was on a particular beer and she replied with no way to know. A patron replied with isnt it 6.1. Its on their board. They filled my growler with a third choice which kicked during the filling and i left with a wet needing to dry out growler with no beer and 20 minutes less time. Kegs were kicked in two varieties that I was interested in trying. There were open areas were I asked if other kegs were available in which they replied there were. #Garbage"}
{"text":"Cool, clean atmosphere, awesome beer selection that changes with the seasons, and yummy food! Great place to grab a drink and watch the game!"}
{"text":"Update: open & sell six packs on Sundays!  If I could give more than 5 stars I would for this selection & service.    They have great food (even have a veggie dog) and a killer selection of beers.  I was truly impressed to find a good selection of bourbon aged beer (my favorite and it is super difficult to find)."}
{"text":"Okay place! Nice beer selection. Good service by the bartender. But the owner seems as if his head is too far up there! He's selfish he's not a people person. I'm sitting here now watching him. I've been coming here for a while now and I've witness him involved more than a handful of altercations. Smh."}
{"text":"Packs and dogs is an interesting hotdog spot! The hotdogs are named after different types of dogs, my usual is the Rottweiler! The toppings are pretty generous and the dogs themselves are decent. The best part is their booze selection, packs and dogs really let me appreciate a good hot dog and beer pairing. I don't even like beer that much personally but they have such a great selection you'll find something to suit you!  Haven't tried anything that isn't a hotdog yet. But I plan to next time around."}
{"text":"Pricey but really good dogs & fries, and about a bazillion kinds of beer. On street parking or a pay lot across the street only."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved to mount Washington in June 2017 and went there a couple times and really enjoyed it- I originally gave it a five star review on yelp!   We went there this week and were very disappointed. We went to pick up some dogs right before the pens game but figured we'd get a draft and watch the first period as we waited for food.  We walked in and only one other person was there which was weird. The guy waiting at the register had to ask to be checked out for his 12 pack because the employee was 5 feet away facing the wall looking in his phone.   We ordered our food, sat at the bar, and asked for the employee to put the game on. THEY DID NOT HAVE THE CHANNEL THAT THE PENS WERE ON. We were honestly shocked. Packs n dogs has always been a busy sports bar on game days!  We waited and watched the game on our phone and literally no one came in the entire first period.... apparently we haven't been there for a while and everyone else has already gotten the message that packs and dogs is not the same. We were really sad!  Not to mention we got home and had our food- dogs are the same (delicious) but they changed their shredded cheese to nacho cheese and their chili recipe which didn't taste bad but we were glad we weren't eating it in public because it was so runny and messy. Also the fries here used to be our favorite- thicc and crispy- they were kinda soggy and the side of ranch was half full.   Overall we are really disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"not quite at the level of dormont dogs or station street but a decent hot dog menu with a bunch of good beers/hard ciders in the coolers .  nice sit-down seating.  parking is dodgy as it is in most of mt. worst-ing-ton .  worth an occasional trip .  good hangover hot dogs."}
{"text":"This place was great. The hot dogs (particularly the golden retriever) were tasty as were the fries. I debated about three vs four stars just because I've had some pretty amazing hot dogs but the beer selection really sealed the deal. Solid selection with some I hadn't come across in my hometown of Atlanta."}
{"text":"Do you like craft beer? No, actually, do you like massive bottle selections of craft beer that you can mix-n-match to your six packs content? Look no further because Packs & Dogs awaits.  It's not a matter of IF you can find something good. Rather, it's deciding on WHAT to get. Multiple shelf lined cookers make that decision rather difficult. That and the fact that this shop also has six or so drafts to choose from at the bar in the back...and hotdogs, of course.  Booths and tables line the one side of the indoor seating area and chairs and couches line the other. Want some fresh air instead? Grab a table at the outdoor seating area.  As for me, I bought a bottle of O'Fallon Cherry Chocolate, plopped down on one of the comfy chairs and watched the last 20 min of Rambo: First Blood, Part II on the corner TV.  Stay in or take out; you can't lose!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get a quick grab at Mt Washington.  The dogs (I tried the Chihuahua hot dog) and the fries are worth the visit.  There is a huge selection of beers to choose from too! The venue is nice too, very well maintained and the stuff friendly.  Compared to other - possibly overrated - hot dog places in the city (e.g., Franktuary) this place is definitely winning the battle! I would definitely visit back."}
{"text":"Great food but it took 40 minutes for a bartender to get our food order. That's not right."}
{"text":"I literally live a few doors down from Packs, and I'm a big fan of craft beers, so I'm definitely a regular. I typically grab a mix-n-match six-pack and go, the selection is fantastic and if you don't see what you want, the owner is almost always there and is willing to consider getting in things you request. Food-wise, I usually stick with the chicken tenders. They are huge and taste great! Kinda want to try the \"funnel fries\" that are new on the appetizer menu... well, one of these days!"}
{"text":"Name says it all. Six packs, loose bottles, dogs and sandwiches. Friendly service. Great selection of beers. Very good dogs. Fun toppings.  Fun place for a snack or quick bite on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"After my first visits here, I found It was surprisingly good! Didn't  expect anything special for a hot dog shop. But I can taste the meat they put in the dog were good. And now I am a returning/regular customers here. And i would recommend friend going over and anybody who is in the neighborhood to try this place out."}
{"text":"This place is a winner! We were in town visiting family, and thought the inclines would be a fun touristy adventure. We went up the Duquesne, walked up to the Mon to find a spot for lunch, and then down the Mon Incline. But after the walk along the street overlooking the rivers, we were cold and in need of lunch warmth :)  First off, the beer selection is amazing. And Mr. L and I are one to always try new beers, but they had a ton I had never even seen before. Very exciting! and incredibly reasonably priced, even on the specialty beers.  And the dogs were excellent - mom and I both had the German Shepherds (sauerkraut & spicy brown mustard), and Mr. L had the Bulldog (same as ours but on a kielbasa). The hotdog was delicious, but I think if I got it again, I'd go w/ the kielbasa. And we had onion rings which were a hit, although the coating was more of the crumbly coating, and I prefer the puffy coating, but they stayed crispy. And I had the cheese fries (naturally), and I found them to be excellent! Molten fake cheese and yummy fries = how I love them.  Mr. L said if we had one of these near where we live, he'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer but quite possibly the worst most expensive hot dogs ever!  First time I went in sober and hated them then I decided to give it another shot while drunk.........still couldn't finish it which says a lot!"}
{"text":"I love a good hot dog.  Nothing better than an all-American food that is quite convenient to eat, who doesn't like 'no plate required' food?  What makes a hot dog really good are the toppings you can use.  Packs & Dogs matches the two so perfectly that they create return customers without even trying.  The menu is pretty simple.  Honestly, it's one of the smallest menus I have come across in the Pittsburgh region.  The thing you have to remember is that this is a place that provides hot dogs, it's in their name, so think about that.  Now just because I said it like that doesn't mean they only carry hot dogs, they actually have sides like onion rings, fries and chicken tenders.  They also offer burgers, but seriously stick to the hot dogs here.  One of the things I love about this place is that they refer to their dogs with actual names of dog breeds.  I decided on the Chihuahua which is nothing more than a chili cheese dog with onions.  When I got my order I was floored almost.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that although I ordered only one hot dog, it was more than enough for a single meal.  The way they piled the toppings on here actually kind of made it an all in one meal.  The hot dog itself is delicious.  When I bit into the hot dog it had that snap you want when you go to a hot dog shop.  The casing makes for a good hot dog here.  The chili was rather good too, not overpowering at all and taste combination with the dog itself was amazing.  The onions added a bit of sweetness which offset the spice of the chili.  But what was trying to steal the spotlight from the hot dog was the mound of shredded cheddar cheese on top of it all.    I know I referred earlier to hot dogs as being a 'no plate required' food, but I was so happy I had that basket to catch any and every thing that fell off this monster of a hot dog.  I didn't leave anything in that basket after I destroyed the hot dog, I did not care how I looked when I was devouring that dog.  I used my hands to pick up every last stray that fell off and shoved it in my mouth.  It was carnal and satisfying.  So satisfying that I had no appetite for the event I attended afterwards, but totally worth it.  The packs part of this is pretty solid as well.  There is a humongous amount to choose from when you are looking for you alcoholic sidekick for the hot dog.  A suggestion to you is to pick out your beer first before you order.  This could turn out to be a longer task than you imagined.  I had a nice Russian stout that I had never heard of before my visit here.    Customer service is top notch here.  They definitely pay attention to you and make you feel welcomed here.  I noticed that they have regulars and I have seen the proof as to why."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers!!! They had everything that I was looking for. I also had a chihuahua chili dog and it was so good.  The place was just remodeled and looks beautiful, you could eat off the floor. I got my food and beers to go, but next time I will be hanging out there. It's a perfect atmosphere for good food and brews.   Make sure to go here!!!"}
{"text":"I live up on Mount Washington and love coming here for a quick six pack or bomber. Walked in today to grab a six pack, got what I wanted (which were some of the better stuff they had I'll admit) and went to the counter and WITH the mix and match discount it was $30+. I was told the new manager raised prices. As a customer review, I just want to let you know that they are a bit too high. Compared to other bottle shops around the area.   Grapefruit Sculpin 5.50? I can get a pint of it for $4-$4.50 somewhere else let alone a bottle of it. Unfortunately unless I hear they lowered their prices again, I will be driving a bit further to other bottle shops instead of going to packs and dogs.   I was told I wasn't the only one who mentioned they probably won't be back. I want to come back, please re-think the prices"}
{"text":"Note: The beer selection is heavenly.  Pennsylvania's archaic alcohol laws make it difficult to find stores with a wide variety of beer without having to buy a case, so coming here was refreshing. The mix and match six pack deal is nice because they take $4.50 off the total of the individually marked bottles. Beers vary a lot in price, but are mostly are in the $3 to $4 range.  I had been to Packs & Dogs before, when I lived in Mt. Washington about five years ago, but hadn't been back until I met a few friends there recently. Since then they've expanded their menu to include more apps and sandwiches.  Ordered a beer, a six pack (which you can't drink there), and a soft pretzel served with Yuengling beer cheese.  I'll save room for a hot dog during my next visit."}
{"text":"The hot dogs and service were very good. The hot dogs taste a bit different than expected but still very good.  Customer service was out standing.   The person brought our food out when they saw my freind was visually impaired.  They cleared our stuff away too.  Very earnest and freindly."}
{"text":"I'm guessing this place is under new management and they're struggling to get their footing because my recent experience was a disaster. When we were able to get the attention of the server / manager / whomever, he was super friendly, which is the only reason I'm giving this two stars. The selection has decreased drastically, the draft beers taste as though the lines haven't been cleaned in months, and everything was very slow despite not being busy. I'm bummed, because this was one of my favorite places to just chill. I'll try again in a month or so and see if they have a better handle on things, but I'm not terribly optimistic."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of beer. Pick a beer and stay a while or mix and match a six pack to go. The hot dogs are decent. I enjoy lounging on the couch and watching a game. If it weren't overpriced (typical of Pittsburgh) this place would probably get a 5"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I come from Wooster, Ohio (2 hours away) just to come here. The food is incredible, service is outstanding, and the beer selection is just wonderful. (Not to mention, it's on Mt. Washington which is beautiful)  I found my new favorite beer last time I was here, orange blossom cream ale by Buffalo Bill and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I definitely can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and a cost-effective one to boot!  Good dogs, chill environment, and nice people working.  Not much more one can ask for!  The only thing that would make this place better for me would be if it was located closer to Southside Works.  I think this is a spot that I would frequent far more often!"}
{"text":"make your own 6 pack and many beer options. open late. love this place."}
{"text":"I don't see many of these old-fashioned hot dog shops around, but we came here on a whim. They have a few specialties, and also let you choose any combination of toppings that you want. The vienna beef frank was awesome, as was my chihuahua (chili, cheddar, onion) combo. The guy kept recommending their subs, so I do wonder if they make a killer sub rather than hot dog. Maybe that's what we'll try if we're around next time."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs aren't just some tube full of meat byproducts....well, they are, but not all meat tubes are created equally!  And not every corner shop can hock their wares in the way that Packs and Dogs does.  As a long time lover of sausages, wursts, and such, I've been around the block with the meaty objects of my affections, and I have to say, Packs and Dogs always keeps me coming for more.  The secret to their success is simplicity.  Natural casing dog, an All beef Silverstar dog, a veggie dog, and a kielbasa.  That's the 4 dog options and, really only the All beef and Natural casing get a workout.  Packs keeps with the standard fare when it comes to dog options, with the Chihuahua being the nom de plume for the chili cheese dog.  But what a dog!  Home made chili that is well seasoned, though not spicy, big chunks of white onion, and shredded cheese.  The bun does all it can just to keep the ship from sinking.  And while it often turns into a knife and fork kind of dog, its worth every bite.  The rest of the menu is just as good, which includes a personal favorite, the Irish Setter, your standard slaw dog, as well as a take on the Chicago Dog, and a make your own variety.  And make sure you plan on eating on site, since Packs and Dogs has a beautiful diner style counter, complete with swivelling, circle chairs and booths.  Though, the addition of comfy couches and a mounted 42 inch big screen tv add a bit of a living room atmosphere.  And we can't forget the beer selection!  There is a constantly revolving and improving selection of foreign and domestic craft beers, along with your standard session favorites, all at reasonable prices.  A six pack to go, a draft at the counter, or a bottle in a booth, Packs and Dogs is a nice place for a hot dog dinner.  Now, with all good things, there is some downsides, though none have to do with service, selection, or quality, luckily.  Being that Packs and Dogs is located right on Shiloh in Mt. Washington, sometimes you'll get groups of smoking stragglers hanging out on the pretty tiny outdoor wooden patio, which has a tendency to bottleneck the foot traffic.  And parking is always at a premium on the Mountain, so be sure you're ready to walk from the downstairs parking area, connected to the adjacent lot.  But over all, you won't find a better place for beers and beef links in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I am thrilled there is a six-pack shop in Mt. Washington.  I finally stopped in one night in the mood for a seasonal beer and I knew P&D wouldn't disappoint.  I've heard from others they are pricey, but I guess that is what is expected from a place that sells craft beer.    I was really pleased with their selection.  Most of the bottles I purchased were around $2-3 which is expected when buying speciality beer.  My six pack ended up around $14.  I don't understand the complaints about the price, really.  Next door at Redbeards you can buy $2.50 drafts?  For the same price, I can get better quality and more selection of beer.  Sure, there are beers for $7/bottle, but I'm pleased to find cherry wheat for the same price.  Haven't tried the food, but I did notice it's all dog themed, which is novel, but kind of cute.  It's set up kind of neat, with outdoor and bar seating.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Visited here twice this year with friends, & I'm not sure what happened...possibly new management? The first visit we had to ask for menus twice. As we were enjoying our German Shepherds (so delicious) & shared jalapeño poppers, the server brought over a basket of chicken tenders & said something that we interpreted as, \"on the house.\" So we were confused but excited, but it was way too much food. The server came over later & asked if we ordered the chicken tenders, he mistakenly gave us someone else's order. By that time we had already tried them...so we were charged for them. Needed a doggy bag, had to ask for it twice...I could understand if they were busy, but we were the only ones there. But, yesterday's service was legit awful...we were the only ones there, very exhausted & hadn't eaten all day. Had to ask for menus twice, & we gave it a good 25 minutes, since we were enjoying 2 sample flights. I was the 2nd out of my group of 3 to order & the server behind the bar started walking away after my cheeseburger order...my friend called him back & said he would like to order food too. Our chili cheese fries came with 2 of our orders. By that time a few more people rolled in. Luckily my friend had the chili cheese fries to munch on, because we scarfed down our burger & dog. There were 2 servers behind the bar & when one came out, walking towards the door, my friend got his attention & asked if he could have a cheeseburger. The server admitted he forgot about the order & rushed it. The cheeseburger finally came & my friend scarfed it down & we tallied up & left.   Selection-smection. If the customer service isn't your priority, then you're in the wrong business. There are far too many options in Pittsburgh, even on the Mount, for craft beer & bar food. If there's a next time, it'll be a dog & a 6'er to go."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is that the music is too loud. Other than that, I liked my Primanti's style dog with fries and slaw, and I hate Primanti's sandwiches! lol. The fries are awesome too. Check them out next time you're on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"This is the place to get a six pack off beer. They cycle through every beer imaginable.I love it.The only place I've found in pittsburgh to get my favorite beer,habenero sculpin. The food is good as well."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a place that delivers beer? And if you don't want it delivered, it's a super convenient spot to grab a brew or two!  This place is one of my favorite new discoveries about Mount Washington. Packs & Dogs sells regular 6 packs, but also allows you to create your own 6 pack, which is really one of the highlights of going here. Not only do they have a great variety of beers (including seasonal favorites), but they also have a decent amount of ciders, which I am a personal fan of! During holidays, I have been pleasantly surprised by the amount of seasonal beers that are available (i.e. Halloween, Christmas).  I love that Pack and Dogs encourages you to try new stuff that you may not have had an opportunity to try before, without worrying about not liking a whole case. Some beers are around $2, whereas others are upwards of $5.   This place also has sandwiches, hot dogs, and fries that are all pretty decent. If you place an order for delivery, there is a $10 minimum food charge so you might as well go all out! I recommend a sandwich and definitely the chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Six packs and hot dogs. They go together in Pittsburgh like coffee and donuts. And this place does it right. After a walk up to Mt Washington, you need an unpretentious (not dive bar) place to unwind over some beers and eat some hot dogs. With their wide selection of both, this place fits the bill every time.   Their prices are reasonable and the same for take-out as when you lounge on their couches and drink them inside. So if you take the incline up, venture a little off the main drag and find this gem."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the cheese steak and wife had the  capacola ( not too spicy ). Hot and fresh   Loved the taps and the huge bottle selection. A wide range of state wide beers etc."}
{"text":"With a great beer selection that's reasonably-priced, chill vibe, and their simple, but pleasing meat-in-casings menu, there's simply little to complain about!  It's definitely no D's, but that's actually a good thing in this instance! You get to ditch the busy crowds and long waits. I mean, seriously...a long wait to eat a hot dog? I'm not sure if that's justifiable. Ever.  They have a ton of beers in their coolers and quite a few on draft. Seriously, if you go to Packs & Dogs and can't find something worth drinking, your level of beer snobbishness must be on a level even hipsters can't latch onto, and I'd hate to be your taste buds.  The Smith's natural casing dogs are excellent, and while their menu seems limited at first glance, you can always conjure up any custom dog you'd like with their solid list of toppings.  The service is friendly and fast, and the food is exactly what you'll want to down with your cold brew(s)! I'll plan on going back...a lot!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Pittsburgh for the weekend we were exploring the area and came across this place. Was unexpectedly surprised when we walked in to see a long row of refrigerators filled with a great selection of both craft and mainstream beers. Would definitely come here to watch a game or to enjoy a new type of beer. Did not try the food as we had already eaten but the dogs looked good."}
{"text":"I got a Bulldog, which is a kielbasa with saurkraut and spicy brown mustard. Unfortunately, the kielbasa was relatively tasteless. They have a lot of different bottles of beer, but I couldn't find many local beers. The beers on tap were not local beers, but were nationally available. So in the end, this place is relatively generic and unexciting."}
{"text":"Packs & Dogs has quickly become my favorite neighborhood spot. Maybe because there isn't much else around in Mt. Washington or the fact that I just love the idea. Either way...  I have to first say that I am no beer kings. I drink beer, yes, however I'm not one to answer your question on IPA's and stouts. What's nice about Packs & Dogs is there is such an enormous selection of beers to choose from. I do get nervous though because I feel like it would be quite easy to pick something up that I don't like. They have a variety of different 6 pack prices depending on which beers you choose. You can also get 12 packs to go which is great for game day. They have a decent draft selection and in talking to the owner/manager the last time I was there (today) he puts out I guess what you'd call, \"sale\" beer to get people to try beers that normally you would never consider buying before. He doesn't do it because the beer doesn't taste well, he really wants people to expand their palette.  Now my favorite things: the food. I love their hot dogs. I'll let you drink while I eat one or two all beef hot dogs. I have yet to venture off of their $6.00 meal which includes one hot dog, fries (which are amazing) and a small drink. With a wide variety of complimentary topics, why not? They also feature many different varieties of hot dogs with a variety of toppings. One day I'll even try a hamburger, but I'm too addicted to the hot dog.  Thank GOD Pennsylvania doesn't have food laws like they have alcohol laws or I'd be in trouble."}
{"text":"Love it, great beer selection, great food, awesome 6 pack and 12pack deals. Great place I come here a lot now that I live up here. It's becoming once a week at least which is fine by me!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Not over crowded, able to get a table. Basic hotdogs and fries menu with a variety of toppings to choose from. If you love beer, this is the place for you. Good service. Good food. Open late."}
{"text":"Too hungry to make it all the way home the other night, a drained, hungered, athirst Kay and Darren made their way to Mt. Washington for refreshment and comfort on a scalding, congested day.   What we found was the illegitimate son of D's Sixpax and Dogs from Regent Square. Upon entering, our ears were assailed by stridently played-to-death selections from AC/DC and Motley Crue. The music was blaring so much that the gent taking our order at the red-and- silver, diner-style counter could hardly hear my words. I should have brought my earplugs.   Like another reviewer, I too ordered the Golden Retriever, a Steeltown take on a Chi-Town classic complete with all the appropriate accessories (radioactive relish, dill pickles, tomatoes, celery salt, school bus-yellow mustard, and sport peppers). The frank itself was grilled immaculately, its natural casing snapping like bubble wrap with every breach of my incisors, its juicy beef essence permeating each chomp, the accompanying toppings only enhancing and never distracting from the proteins at hand.   And the fries were ochroid spud cudgels par excellence with their coats of outer crispness and plush insides.   The bacon cheeseburger might have been a winner had it been cooked to medium rare instead of well-done. Judging by the dense texture, I suspect it may have been in a freezer a bit too long as well. The bacon was very crisp, however, and the other fixings, including the bakery-quality bun (used for the dog also. did they both come from Grandview Bakery?), were plentiful and fresh.  Packs and Dogs has an odd mancave/greasy spoon/bro-bar vibe about it that I'm not sure works. As I alluded to before, the music was entirely too loud, especially considering that this was an early Thursday evening and that attendance was scant; it was as if a kegger party was being held and hardly anyone showed up. A MMA program could be seen on the flatscreen telly on the wall, but due to the noise (and I love loud, heavy music, just not when I'm trying to eat at a restaurant) we couldn't hear anything uttered by Joe Rogan or the muscled, deformed-of-ear fighters he was interviewing. Leather couches, a jukebox, and a dart board populate the front, which I suppose is intended to create a comfortable ambience, but I cannot imagine that being the case at P&D's on a sultry, intoxicated Saturday night.   While quite obviously a copycat of the East End's version, Mt. Washington's Packs and Dogs misses the bullseye in terms of atmosphere despite making mighty fine hot dogs and french fries. You can relax at D's. Here? Not so much, I reckon. At P&D's busiest, you may have luck getting into a fight, finding a liason, drinking yourself into the gutter, or simply garnering attention to your tanned, scarcely-garbed self.    P.S. Packs and Dogs would be an effortless 4 stars if it was just a hot dog stand and nothing more."}
{"text":"If you Re there for beer, microbrews and such, this is the place for you.  However, if you are looking for a good chili dog, try someplace else.  While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks."}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago to Pittsburgh. This is the only place that I've gotten a true Chicago style hotdog outside of Chicago. Here, for some reason, they call it a \"Golden Retreiver\". They do it right with a Vienna Beef frank (though it's skinless) weighing in at a quarter pound! They even use the bright green relish and real sport peppers! The only thing they don't have is the poppyseed buns. Wash it down with a great beer from their vast selection, and you can't go wrong! This place has a great diner-style counter area, booths, and a nice couch area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good, authentic food cheap. Limitless dog choices, but sub choices are rather limited...no turkey, just Italian. But the bread and toppings were fresh.   Only a few steps away from the Mong Incline on Mount Washington."}
{"text":"Took a trip up the Mog incline and accidental found this gem. I can't say enough about this place it's the kind of store I wish there were more of in the U.S. Half hot dog grill, half craft beer store it's small tidy and well decorated.  I had the retriever and bloodhound from their canine themed menu, both were delicious and well priced at about $3.25.  The real treat for me was their beer selection; I really hope the trend of stores I've been seeing offering excellent craft beer selections continues. Any beer lover can find something to enjoy here. Nothing more to say, love beer? Love hot dogs? Get your ass here!"}
{"text":"I went in looking to expand my new found taste for IPAs. This is a great place to do that because you can mix and match! A staff member came over and asked me my preferences and helped me to pick out a few brews. Of course I forget which ones they were, but I do remember that I liked them.   Definitely costs a bit more to do it this way. I haven't tried the food yet so I cannot leave a complete review on that (yet!).  But I do enjoy the casual/intimate vibe here and like the two tables out front in the summer time."}
{"text":"If one can get excited about a hot dog, you'll like Packs and Dogs. They have all the gimmicky dogs. The Chicago, the chili cheese, and even the vegan. Unfortunately they deep fry the vegan which totally kills the health value.  Great selection of brews including my Ithaca Beer Company's IPA."}
{"text":"PA is so goofy with their alcohol laws! I could only purchase two six packs in one purchase. Then I had to purchase a third separately and the cashier had to literally walk me outside to give me the third six pack.   Aside from the Amish laws imposed, I was very happy with the selection. I'm new to the idea of just grabbing individual beers (oviously I include paying for it), and going, but I'm so into it now. I had my own personal beer tasting party! Individual beers will run you around $2-3 and the fancy schmancy type Framboise's up to $5 .   Some of the ones I choose were Blue Point Toasted Lager, Blue Moon Spring Blonde Wheat Ale and Fort Collins Chocolate Stout. I was super into the Fort Collins and the Blue Point was ok. Blue Moon was a little too....predictable Blue Moon.   I feel like this is an adult candy store. Minus the candy and plus the alcohol content!"}
{"text":"After a weekend of sight-seeing in the city and eating and drinking just about everything in in front of us, my husband said that he could really go for something low key, like just a hot dog and a beer. Enter Packs and Dogs. Which provided that exact thing. With a few tables, some casual seating, and a small outdoor area, Packs and Dogs, has row after row of beer coolers with just about every wacky, far-flung and beloved beer you can image. With a robust menu of hot dog options and sides like Motz sticks, they offer an simple, easy to please option for everyone. My Chihuahua dog was decent. I really like the bun- It was like a thick Hawaiin Roll. My complainant is with the cheese- it was like Kraft shredded cheddar cheese that wasn't melted yet and kept falling off in little pieces.  As for drinks, I can picked the Sweet Baby Jesus Chocolate Peanut Butter stout (which tasted like a tootsie roll). Had I not drank so much the day before, I would've like to keep going at this place to try all the different varieties. I can see why this place is a local favorite for beer variety."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are solid.  The only negative was that the ingredients on my hot dog weren't hot.  The chili and cheese were coldish, and the cheese was not melted.  It's just not my style.  The value is definitely there and the dogs are definitely a nice size.  I would recommend."}
