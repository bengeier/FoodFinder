{"text":"The food and ambiance were fine but server (an older gentleman) tried to encourage each of us to order a starter when we already told him were were not having starters; please respect your guests - if we say we don't want a starter, we don't want a starter.  The waiter who brought our food was much friendlier and less patronising.  Prices were slightly high considering the range of the menu and the cost of pasta."}
{"text":"Every dish we had was made from fresh ingredients and love - you could just tell.

The wine list is extensive and well priced - not overly priced like most places.

We shared three dishes, family style, Gorgonzola Gnocchi (homemade gnocchi), Wild Mushroom Risotto, Butternut Squash Ravioli in a Creamy Leek Sauce. Yummilicious!

Our waitress, Elizabeth, was sweet and attentive, but allowed us our conversation and didn't rush us at all. We were able to enjoy the meal and have a business meeting at the same time. 

Will def make this one of my stops when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced . I understand it's Valentine's Day but at least great your guests and notify them of delays. Or at least give us a menu to look at. Realized after it was a prix menu, was not mentioned anywhere on the website or in person. Waited 45 minutes for my table even though I made reservations. Once seated it took 30 minutes to get a drink and this after I waved the waitress to get us drinks. Food came an hour after ordering so that meant there eS no chance for me to order dessert. Getting the bill took longer . Basically absolute bad service. Was not offered anything for the inconvenience"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was slow. We came on a weekday lunch. When we arrived, there was only one table, it was a large lunch party, but there were three servers on hand. No one came to help us, eventually someone from the kitchen had to greet us. We got the seafood salad, nothing spectacular; too much citrus going on, couldn't really taste much. The bolognese was good. My tagliatelle with beef was too oily, even for an oil based sauce. The service was mediocre. The actual person serving us was nice, but the other waitress was rude. She came over to take the debit/credit machine and when we asked her about our takeout, she said she was only coming to get the machine, it was busy, and that she's sure the other waitress was getting it done. The way she said it was rude and, even though she wasn't responsible for our table, she should have been more polite. Eventually we found out that the takeout was waiting at the front for us (we had to physically hunt down our waitress at this point), which no one mentioned to us. Overall, the food wasn't good enough to override the bad service, and although our own server was kind, she was a bit tardy and the overall experience was ruined by the other waitress."}
{"text":"Yo, Canadians, get on top of reviewing this place! 

Family-owned and cozily tucked into the corner of a block, Aielli is a must for a special dinner with friends, family, or a romantic interest. 

Our server, the chef's wife, walked through the menu and its highlights perfectly. We ordered a red wine, a cab (excuse my short memory re: wine brands), and a smattering of appetizers and entrees. Highlights below:

- Beef tenderloin carpaccio, topped with capers, lemon oil, grated parm, and rocket salad 
- Goat cheese-topped and garlicky sauteed mushroom medley salad 
- Luigi's pappardelle bolognaise, with an excellent veal meat ragu sauce and shavings of Grano Padano
- Gorgonzola scalloped potatoes...mmm

A warm, charming meal, fantastic from start-to-end. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the village? Easily. Best restaurant in the village? The jury's still out.

Anyone who's followed my reviews knows that I'm a fan of Maranello Cafe (see https://www.yelp.ca/biz/maranello-cafe-mississauga), the sleepy little Italian cafe that offers some of the best veal sandwiches anywhere within a 12-block radius. Beside that is an Italian restaurant - which or may or may not be owned by the same family - that is well-known to anyone that's lived in the area long enough.

I hesitate to call Aielli a \"hidden gem\", because it plays host to plenty of private events and meetings, but the restaurant is far enough near the edge of the village that you could conceivably sell it to your friends as such.

There's a very... relaxed, almost sleepy, vibe when you walk in here. Normally, the restaurant isn't open Mondays, but I was attending a media launch for the Mississauga Waterfront Festival and people just sort of sauntered in without much care. Rest assured, this is a prime spot to take a loved one or a family member for dinner as the darker ambiance and old-school architecture lends itself well to lazy, carefree get-togethers.

My overall experience attending this launch event was stellar. It had been several years since I attended any function here (for reference, the last time I visited, I organized a media conference here to kick off the village's 175th anniversary - showing my age), but the food was even better than I remembered.

My co-worker and I were ushered to a table filled with fancy cutlery and soon received a glass of either red or white wine depending on our preference. After the presentations were done, we broke for lunch and made our way over to a buffet-style setup in the next room while MWF featured artist Alessia Cohle performed.

Based on what my good friend Kris U has said about the food in the past, the buffet selection remains the same year-after-year - which is not necessarily a bad thing. We had a choice between multiple meats, proteins, salads and desserts, and I found myself quickly piling a plate high with a bit of everything. (Rest assured, I slept like a log when I got home.)

I ended up settling for two different types of salad (standard balsamic salad and what appeared to be a vegetable salad with stringy ropes of cucumber), rice pilaf, a heaping piece of roast beef, a nice light piece of fish (albacore?), steamed greens, chicken breast and a huge roll with a pat of butter. Rest assured, I cleaned my plate and was left stuffed and satisfied. The glass of white wine was the boozy cherry on top - I didn't have enough time to try the desserts.

If I have any complaints (and they're minor), the pilaf tasted very slightly firm, though that could have just as easily been caused by it sitting out for an hour while the presentations happened. Likewise, the cutlery wasn't neatly wrapped in a cloth as I'm used to, and I settled for cheap white napkins - a bit noticeable compared to the rest of the high-quality decorations and utensils at the table.

Regardless, as the presentations at the media launch showcased, this is a family-run business that has been supporting the festival for more than 20 years. Aielli is well-worth the visit, not only for the amazing Italian food, but the atmosphere and family-like vibe that runs through nearly every aspect of it.

Highly-recommended."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant 
The chef & staff go out of their way to make you welcome 
Great wine selection !
The food is great 
You get a nice relaxing atmosphere 
When it gets busy it isn't to busy 
It's always a fun time"}
{"text":"After what seems like years, I finally had the pleasure of dining at Aielli for lunch yesterday and I seriously don't know what's kept me from coming here sooner - oh yeah, there are a million restaurants in the 905! 

So yesterday I attended a media lunch at Aielli and lunch was provided at the end of the event. There was an extensive spread put out for those in attendance inclusive of 2-3 types of salad (a balsamic mixed green salad, a noodle salad and a broccoli and quinoa salad), a salmon done with a butter-lemon-caper dressing, meatballs in marinara, sliced roasted pork in a sweet mustard sauce, roasted beef with mushrooms, a plain pasta with marinara and a rice pilaf. 

I went to town on this little lunch buffet - much to the chagrin of future (sleepy) me. I tried everything except for the broccoli salad and the rice pilaf because I like my carbs saucy! So how did everything rank? A quick summary below of each, and do bare in mind this was served buffet style so things were prepared on a large scale format:

Balsamic mixed green salad - Great selection of crisp fresh greens, not overly heavy on the dressing, light and very refreshing. 

Noodle salad - Tasty, similar to a cold MacN Cheese - Italian style

Salmon with a butter-lemon-caper dressing - I'm usually a little hesitant with salmon as most places dry it out but even cooking a high volume every piece was cooked perfect and moist

Meatballs in marinara - smaller meatballs for easier consumption, incredible sauce and flavourful meat blend

Sliced roasted pork in a sweet mustard sauce - Yum, I believe there was little mustard seeds throughout

Roasted beef with mushrooms - LOVE. Still medium rare in many pieces, the mushrooms and light gravy were delicious. All meat was moist, not a dry piece in the bunch

Pasta with marinara - simple and perfect. A little soft on the pasta but again remember this was made in a massive batch so considering that it was perfect.

Aielli is definitely a Port Credit/Mississauga staple and has been for years. The food is done in the old style, with high quality and nothing crazy - just like a Nonna would make!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Worst service of my life I am here as we speak I've been waiting 2 hours now for food this is ridiculous, worst service of my life and no one even comes to ask us if we want drinks , I'm on the erge of dying of dehydration"}
{"text":"We had dinner here yesterday (Saturday evening) and it was  a mainly good experience. The atmosphere is great and our waitress, an older blonde lady, was very professional. She seated us at a nice table and brought us waters right away without us even having to ask. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and told us the specials by heart, which was really impressive. 

I ordered a seafood linguine which was about $20, and although it tasted great, it wasn't a whole lot of food. My friend ordered a pizza and it was very small as well. Another problem was that we were seated infront of the windows and they were open because of the nice weather but it was somewhat of a nuisance  because lakeshore is really loud and you could hear every car that passed by.

The quality of the food and the service however was really great!"}
{"text":"The occasion was a large family get together to celebrate a birthday. We were a motley crew, ranging in age from 14 months to mid sixties and everything in-between. We were a bit high spirited, but our server did nothing to dampen our enjoyment of the occasion. She was splendid, attentive, friendly, prompt - and a wonderful time was had by all. The food was delectable, in particular a beautifully prepared lamb shank, savoury butternut squash medallions in a creamy leek sauce, tasty lasagna - and the Cesar salad was a delight. And the desserts, all prepared in house, were fabulous. There was something great at Aielli for us all!"}
{"text":"One of the more expensive places on the lake shore strip but at least it is consistent. Standard Italian fare, overpriced as per usual in toronto but you can do a lot worse than this in the city.

Food feels home made with simple ingredients, worth a visit as a couple with a sitter watching the kids."}

Not quite on the popular stretch of Port Credit, this restaurant certainly does not gauge much interest. We found a last minute reservation on NYE, whilst everything was booked up. This doesn't surprise me - the place offers a mediocre fine-dining experience. Details: 

The Outside: Not much. You could mistake Aielli for a dive at night time.

The Inside: Some consider it classy, but for me it was simply tacky - the room we were seated in had been \"Michaelangelo-ed\" all over. I am not sure I can elaborate on that, but picture a really bad version of the Italian renaissance on the walls. 

The Peeps: Older crowd. 

The Service: Older servers, but charming to say the least. And attentive.

The Wine: Fine-dining calls for wine and we ordered a Pinot Grigio. I believe the wines start at $50 which is fairly reasonable for a fine-dining. 

Primi: We shared the the Spicy One Pan Calamari which was neither memorable nor spicy. But the Mushroom Medley Salad was to die for - think sauteed mushrooms and goat cheese crumble - this one doesn't disappoint! 

Piatto: Sadly, we all ended up ordering the Angus Striploin steak, I believe 10 or 12oz (we were 4 of us). And this ended up disappointing all of us, steak lovers. The meat felt cheap and tough, the glaze bitter, and although cooked to perfection, it was just not great. 

For dessert we ordered Tiramisu and Creme Brulee - both perfect, no complaints.

Will I be back? Maybe. I do want to try the pasta here. 
Margarita rating? I went classy. Wine only!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times, every time we've had a great experience. It's got a cosy, charming atmosphere and friendly staff, whether it's a weeknight or weekend. Their gorgonzola gnocchi is one of my favorite italian dishes of all time. The mushroom salad is also very good. I would recommend this to anyone looking to dine in the area."}
{"text":"Family run, old school Italian. Everything is fresh made and served with a smile.  The lamb shank melted off the bone.  Risotto just the perfect amount of creaminess, with the vegetables taking centre stage I the flavour dept.  I have yet to make it to dessert because the portions are quite large.  Good wine and liquor list as well."}
{"text":"The service was great, the place was cozy and nice, and the food was well above average. I do however believe it is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Can you say horrible. . The  restaurant was under staffed it seemed and the old blonde waitress barely gave us the time of day. She even did not notice the fly in the water that she brought. Don't do us any favors as we only wanted a good meal on a date night. 

I was disgusted with the service and the way the staff treated us. I would highly recommend you not wasting your time."}
{"text":"Warning guys This place has to be the worst restaurant we've ever been to! Horrible service, its slow and the waiters are either rude or clueless. The owner was HORRIBLE! The food is not good at all, in fact it was cold and very overpriced. Completely ruined our date night we ended up leaving in the middle of it and going to another restaurant! Pathetic"}
{"text":"This is a classy looking place with some up-scale Italian cuisine and none of the pretensions. Our waitress, whom I assumed to be one of the owners, was a charming peppy lady. She was very familiar with the menu and proved to be helpful by tailoring to the dietary preference of a member in our group. They have a very extensive wine list, some of which can set you back upwards of $300. They also carry a few beers on tap, of which, Old Credit (available in amber ale and pilsner) stood out as the local crafty choice. 

I opted for the Penne Arrabiatta, penne pasta topped with a course tomato sauce and grilled Italian sausage. The dish was quite simple and pretty much as good as pasta and tomato sauce gets. There was a small confusion with the menu, which listed prices in A/B format. I assumed one was for lunch and the other was for dinner but I ended up being charged the more expensive one at lunch. Perhaps the prices refer to portion size instead. Despite this issue, the meal and the experience was worthy of the bill."}
