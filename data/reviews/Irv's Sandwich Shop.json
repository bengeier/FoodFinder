{"text":"Good solid basic breakfast food with the best omelets, particularly the barnyard (everything in it), on the east side.  Dan the chefs folds them Greek style.  Basic pancakes and french toast but oh so good.  It's a no ambiance diner with a long counter and a few tables.  The charm of the place is the conversation and bs that goes back and forth between the customers, a wide spectrum of individuals of different ages, races, religions, political beliefs and employment backgrounds!  
This place is the definition of diversity without any pretensions.  It is priceless!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite Cleveland Heights stops for a quick breakfast. The pancakes are great and they have turkey bacon for those who are like me and don't eat pork. A call in order, for my family of four, never takes more than 15-20 minutes! It's not the prettiest place, simply a counter with stools and a couple of tables but the food makes up for the decor!"}
{"text":"If you're on Taylor and you walk into a sandwich shop in this street-side strip, this is what you might expect.  No frills here, and what you see is what you get.  Just authentic diner food, made in front of you for a reasonable price with no fuss.  Nobody's in a hurry and here and its cash only, thank you.  Perfect!

Their corned beef sandwich is far better and cheaper than ANY other place at Cedar/Taylor.  Sorry, Mr Brisket (not).  Their smooth grits also are way, way above average and not dry or crusty at all.

Such better quality and price than Melt or Mr Brisket.  Walk over and see for yourself.

A simple short menu with breakfast and lunch done right."}
{"text":"Diner Fix   people tease me but I am always satisfied.
I can actually talk to the other patrons or read the paper. Beats the ambience at other places."}
{"text":"Just a neighborhood diner, no frills just somewhere to get a bite to eat.  Be careful the grill is small and they cook your eggs on the same grill as Bacon.  \"This can be an issue for some\"."}
{"text":"The food is made right before your eyes. I have had the pancake, French toast all the way to cheese steak. Everything is extremely good."}
{"text":"Great diner food, awesome corned beef and philly. Breakfast looks good, will definitely try in the future. CASH ONLY!"}
