{"text":"Terrible service. Not rude or anything but just plain slow. Took over two hours to have lunch starting at 1:30. It's not like it was still the lunch rush.   Summerlicious menu was poor. The steak frites was pitiful. The steak was cold. The sauce tasted like a black bean sauce which was a terrible pairing with steak. Veggies were not cooked enough and hard. Fries were soggy.   Took 25 min at least to get the bill.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing eggs Benedict, pancakes are super flavourful. Staff is friendly and atmosphere is great. We went there for brunch. Will return!"}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a friend of mine, and was pleasantly surprised by the service, menu and the quality of the food. I wasn't so happy with my bill, though! We were seated right away, and the waiter was super cool and attentive. The atmosphere is very relaxed yet classy. I loved the food so much that I came back twice more!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Dessert not so much! We had the butter chicken which tasted very authentic! Would definetly come here again."}
{"text":"I used to go to this café often, they have nice food great patio, and they had nice staff. However recently they seem to have hired new waiters whom are rude, unfriendly and have no sense of customer service. That alone totally ruins the experience. I hope that this changes soon."}
{"text":"I recently had a trip to Toronto. I got out my computer to do a search on gay owned/friendly restaurants near my hotel. I did not even know until then that my hotel was just 6 block from The Village. I quickly looked through the reviews on the restaurants and decided on Cafe California. It was just a short walk from the hotel. I was promptly greeted by a most gracious lady. She set me at the front window at a table for 4 even though I was by myself.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin dinner. It was amazing. The waiter was great. Did not get his name. After dinner I ordered Tiramisu. They make it in the restaurant and it was probably the best Tiramisu I have ever had.  Would definitely go back. And wod definitely get the Tiramisu again."}
{"text":"It seems that on Church Street, you either get really high-end fare (such as at Byzantium or Fusion), or low-end, such as at O'Grady's or The Churchmouse & Firkin, or worse, the new burger places springing up everywhere. But Cafe California serves the right combination of good food in a nice setting for a decent price. And with a fabulous patio, too.  There are new specials every day, but the items on offer on the regular menu are also very appealing. For example, for those who like basics, there is a lovely steak and frites served with jus in its own little bowl on the side. Then there is the best-seller, the Chicken Malibu - chicken breast stuff with cheese, prosciutto & artichoke with a nice breaded coating. And the meat dishes are always cooked perfectly. For example, the filet mignon is delightful and the lamb chops (when available) are always fabulous. Brunch here is lovely, with some good classics and some creatively done items, such as the West Coast Club Sandwich.  The staff here are very warm and personable, too, and provide excellent service. Leticia, the hostess and one of the owners, is a real darling who will make sure your evening is perfect. She is certainly the best hostess on Church Street. I think this is the kind of place where if you go repeatedly you will make friends with the owners, staff and the regulars. Oh yes, about the regulars, it really says something special about a place when there are regulars there. It means they get decent food at a good price and are treated very well. Who could ask for anything more? No wonder they keep going back."}
{"text":"My partner and I walked by on a Sunday at noon and saw they offer brunch. We were seated right away, and our waiter was so incredibly helpful. He ordered the eggs benedict and I ordered the french toast. The eggs benedict was delicious; ample spinach, some sort of cheese, and a lovely homemade hollandaise. I have a huge sweet tooth and I was absolutely blown away by the french toast. It is amazing, thick challah slices and topped with this maple butter (made with frangelico but doesn't taste boozy), icing sugar, slivered almonds, and fruit. it comes with real maple syrup. It is decadent and entirely fabulous! We will return, everyone was so helpful and attentive we really enjoyed ourselves. For two of us it ran us $35 including tip (well worth it in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Amazing food even after the management has changed.  I would absolutely recommend  going for a brunch with friends or family.  They usually have great pris fix menus during city wide food events with summerlicious and winterlicious.  My personal favourite: French toast or the steak and frites.   Can't decide!"}
{"text":"\"... so it's called, 'Cafe California' and it's where?  Toronto?    You're kidding.   What's their speciality, bean sprout poutine?\"      I was skeptical.  We visited Cafe California on a lazy Friday evening.  It wasn't busy. We almost passed by but I'm glad we didn't.    The menu was a nice surprise - well-rounded with lighter options but none of the west-coast, healthier-than-thou attitude.     The food was a nicer surprise.  It was exceptional.       We ordered light drinks, then shared calamari, a california salad, dessert and coffee.   The calamari was perfectly cooked.   The salad was well thought out, well dressed,  fresh, crisp and delicious.   The cheesecake ... wouldn't last two rounds with a New York heavyweight, but still a champ.  Less dense, creamier, not too sweet ... very respectable.    The location and venue were perfect. The sidewalk seating is covered and fenced.  Near the window is plenty of light and quiet enough for conversation.   The wifi is free.  Ask your waiter. (I thought the wifi passphrase was a hoot.)  The staff attended us professionally.  Our waiter and server were personable, knowledgeable and attentive.   Though it was late, we never felt rushed or burdensome.     I recommend Cafe California in Toronto.   Welcoming, relaxed, good food, good service -- and no mention of sprouts with gravy."}
{"text":"Hit this place for January's Winterlicious. Twice. This was Lobster Mac and Cheese, Striploin Steak, and a Chocolate Brownie (with a bottle of wine, of course!). Delicious as always. Got in without a reservation. Tons of lobster in the Lobster Mac and Cheese: it was so good I forgot to take a photo until halfway through. Striploin was done nicely, even ate all my vegetables which never happens. So much food, we took dessert home for later.   Place got packed very quickly and there were only 2 servers plus a runner/busser, but I found them polite, attentive and willing to help each other out. Liked the ambiance (casual but grown up), and even when a large group of 10 showed up, the noise volume was never overwhelming. Clean, professional, tasty."}
{"text":"Sorry that the previous reviewer is hung up with the name. This is my favourite on Church Street. Waiters in the main are cute, service excellent, and I find the menu quite adequate, plus nearly always additional specials. One of the owners are usially on duty to greet you personally and make you feel ay home. Summer patio to watch the action on the street during the wamer weather."}
{"text":"A small group of us went here for dinner for summerlicious. We'd never been before but their menu looked amazing! It offered many delicous options and it was really difficult to choose what to get. We ended up ordering the Lobster Mac and Cheese which definitely delivered. It came in a small package but it had great flavour and large chunks of lobster. We also tried their calamari which was also very flavourful and cooked just right. For our main, most of us had the filet mignon and it was delicious! It was cooked to perfection and the mushroom merlot sauce added some great flavour. One person also had the lamb and it was honestly the best lamb I've ever tasted. I had apple crumble for dessert and it was ok. Someone else had the Amarula cheesecake and it looked delicious.  Since going, we want to go back for round 2 and I've recommended it to others. They've gone and it didn't disappoint. They loved it as much as I did.  I definitely want to check this place out after summerlicious, They have a great menu and its really reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday lunch,  decent place.  Food is good and service staff are friendly.  Simple but pleasant."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal here after a long day.   Fresh ingredients. Killer salad. Stunning pasta. Did not taste processed. But, most of all, the service was over the top: personal, funny, engaging and incredibly attentive. Bob, the manager, made our experience so memorable that my wife made me leave this positive review.   If you want a great meal at reasonable prices and great service then check out this establishment."}
{"text":"Visited end of April 2015  The sidewalk sign caught our attention \"Dinner for two for $69\" which consisted of two appetizers, two mains, two desserts and a bottle of wine.  What a bargain!  Also, the fact we were both hungry and thought it'll be nice to try a restaurant that we haven't tried before since we  hardly venture on Church Street. Seeing that there were still people in the restaurant around 8:30ish was a good sign.  We were greeted warmly upon entering and seated rather quickly.  Service was very casual and friendly which was fitting for the casual place where the server was dressed in shorts, buttoned shirt and running shoes.  Our server seemed to arrive at the right times and was quite attentive, but not overbearing.  The wine selection was limited, but we managed to choose a decent bottle of red which wasn't bad tasting at all. I like to think one cannot go wrong with a shiraz because it's medium to full-bodied wine.  The food on the other hand was a little underwhelming, but what did we expect when the price was that low? I guess we were expecting a good bargain with good food.  That sidewalk sign was definitely good advertising.  We shared the bruschetta plus kale and quinoa falafel salad which weren't that bad, since flavours blended nicely and was quite tasty that we finished both appetizers.  Perhaps fact that we were both hungry contributed to the results.  For the mains, we both ordered the steak dish which was not quite the nice cut of steak.  That probably explained why it was drenched in a mushroom sauce to mask the meat. The steak was tough and chewy, but since we were both hungry, we just ate the steaks and cut around all the fatty parts.  The mains did come with a somewhat healthy portion of vegetables and mashed potatoes which was cooked nicely.  For desserts, we both had the creme brulee which was tasty as the top crackled and the custard was nice and smooth.  Our server had to check out since the restaurant was closing at 10:30pm on a Thursday night, but indicated that we can stay and take our time while we finish our desserts and remainder of the wine.  Overall, it was a decent dining experience and perhaps I'll return to try their regular menu, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to this place for Summerlicious. I hadn't been there in 10 years or more. All 3 of us in our party were disappointed with our food. I ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese for the appetizer and it had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in it. My friend ordered the calamari and it was mushy. He asked for crispy calamari and clearly his original order was just refried. It was awful. The main course both friends ordered the duck breast which was very tough, my lamb was not that tender either. The potatoes were dry and and the vegetables hard and undercooked. There are other restaurants in the area more deserving of my money. I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good as was the service. Visited here for Winterlicious with a friend. Great value for money and I will definitely be back after Winterlicious is over. Nice neighbourhood joint. Had the rack of lamb but the chocolate mousse cake was definitely the highlight!"}
{"text":"Theres a reason this place has been in business for over 20 years in the same location. Other businesses would do well to follow their example.  Good food, reasonable prices, staff that for the most part - enjoy their jobs and will go out of their way to make things right, and most of all, an owner on site that cares about customers and them being happy, returning customers.  There have been a few issues with some staff and some of them being \"tip tarts\" but  the worst have gone on to other ventures.   The paella and steak and frites have never disappointed.   After a disastrous dinner elsewhere last night, it's important to mention that you can actually have a conversation with your table-mates here without being drowned out by loud music.  Nice patio. Great place to go to during Summerlicious or Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"Where is a half star when you need it? Cafe Cali deserves 4 1/2 stars - great service, delicious food, quaint patio, excellent people watching.  The specials are always written on a chalkboard facing the street for easy perusal as you walk by. With a packed menu and lots of tasty treats, there really is something for everyone on this menu - ranging from steak frites for around $28, to a burger for $12, appetizers in the $7-$11 range and a range of great salads. All salads are available in large ($12ish) or small ($8ish) portions, and the option to add chicken, shrimp, etc. for $7.   There were definitely more exotic things on the menu, I may have seen a gazpacho and some seafood dishes, but my picky-eater eyes glazed over at that point...  We ordered an array of appetizers (and maybe a few strawberry...and lime daiquiris) including a caesar salad that was fresh and light, not too much dressing, croutons and parmesan cheese - a caprese salad served with greens and lovely oil & vinegar - goat cheese on bread with greens and red peppers - bruschetta that was DELISH - and also enjoyed the complementary bread basket.  The service really was great as well, we had three attentive servers that were quick and friendly.   Best part? Baskin Robbins right next door... if you sit on the patio (that also offers a smoking and non smoking section), you can enjoy the smell of fresh waffle cones wafting over!"}
{"text":"Did lunch here with 6. Each entree was enjoyed by all. Service was excellent and prompt and reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of food. The entree I had was unique and like to stray from the ordinary. Warmed beet salad with a salmon topper was just perfect for lunch. As  I'm not a huge lunch eater. Atmosphere was bright at noon and like how well spaced the tables were. Service was prompt and most courteous."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Helpful and attentive staff. Reasonable price, glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"This review applies just to the drinks. We ended up here on a Halloween night. Saying the place was loaded with character is an understatement.  Never mind the we came here for drinks and those served the purpose. The prices are decent here and the beer selection is safe. My buddy and I ordered beers while his wife ordered a ginger martini.  Service started out OK but became overbearing as the server kept interrupting us in the midst of conversation. I guess they were trying to be friendly but take a hint folks. Otherwise an OK place to have drinks for a reasonable prices.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Saturday. Had a club sandwich with Avacado. Seemed quite decent."}
{"text":"The overall experience here was great. We had a friendly waiter and nice patio seating facing the street of the vibrant village neighbourhood. The food is good but on the more expensive side. I recommend going during summer or winterlicious time because they have great lunch and dinner price fixed options."}
{"text":"Cafe California is a pretty decent restaurant. Its the type of restaurant you go to when you want to sit at a patio during the summer but don't want the typical pub grub that's available on Church Street.   The martinis were excellent. They cost around $8-$10 and were definitely not stingee on the alcohol. For an appetizer we got bruschetta and for my meal I ordered chicken Caesar salad. The bruschetta was great but I couldn't say so much for my main. The chicken was coated in fried Parmesan cheese, which was too overpowering. It honestly felt like I was eating a brick of Parmesan cheese at times. By the third martini I was half in the bag so I couldn't make room for dessert.   The food, service and atmosphere were good but I found that it's a tad expensive for what it was. They were charging $5-$10 more for a dish you could find at any other 3 star restaurant. Still, it's a nice restaurant if you're looking for a patio'd restaurant on Church Street that doesn't serve just hamburgers and BLT's."}
{"text":"We ate here after a long day at Pride and considering the large crowds on the street we got a great outside seat in 5 minutes. It was a great night with a great view. I actually enjoyed my Madras Fettuccini allot, it was light with a multitude of veggies. The rest of my party really enjoyed the simple light dishes they ordered as well."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious lunch. Food was good with just right portions. Cheesecake was really good."}
{"text":"French Toast!    Yep, the french toast brought my friends and me to Cafe California every weekend for the month we were working near Toronto.  We loved sitting on the patio, drinking a pitcher of sangria, watching the cute servers, and eating the most amazing french toast in the world!  And I really mean the world - I've tried it in about 6 countries!    We're already planning a trip back to Toronto soon - primarily for the french toast!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Recently I went for Summerlicious lunch and for $18, they had a pretty good variety to choose from. The atmosphere was cozy and food was great. Only complaint was the mimosas I ordered was not very good although the last time I ordered it was very good. So I guess it's just based on the bartender. Staff was very pleasant and I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe California for lunch on a Friday during Winterlicious. I've been once before in the summer and both times were impressed by the decor which changes to match the season. Winter includes arrangements of evergreen and painted tree branches.  I wonder if they hire an interior decorator?  Although we'd not made reservations, we were seated right away at one of the few tables without a reserved sign on them.  It must have been so busy because of Winterlicious.  From their Winterlicious menu I had the Spring Rolls, Beef Tenderloin & Mango Stir Fry, and Chocolate Mousse Cake. I would describe each of the portions as small but together did satisfy my hunger.  The two spring rolls were good, but the dipping sauce was your standard plum.  The stir fry was interesting, with slices of carrot and mango along with the beef and basmati rice, but not amazing, as the soya sauce was a bit overpowering.  The Chocolate Mouse however was great; not too much mousse and thus not too heavy.  Our servers/greeters were all very friendly, professional and most importantly made us feel comfortable as they seated us, took orders and served.  The owner also stopped by our table midway through the meal to greet us and ask what we thought of the food.  One of my co-workers joked politely about the smaller portions but the owner very genially and without hesitation offered to bring him another serving. Although my co-worker didn't take him up on the offer, the gesture was appreciated.   I would, and probably will return to Café California."}
{"text":"Decent place right in the heart of Church and Wellesley. Although the fact the  Lobster Mac & Cheese looked a bit like Kraft Dinner, it was amazing and packed with lobster meat! The Pulled Pork Sandwich wasn't as good as I had hoped, because it barely had any meat; instead, it was filled with a ton of big onion and pepper chunks."}
{"text":"We went here for my girlfriend's birthday. We were a group of 10, and they were more than happy to take our reservations when I called the day of...on a Saturday. So I guess if anybody has to make last minute plans on a Saturday night, and no other restaurant is taking reservations, you can call here. :D  The restaurant was dimly lit, and quiet. I'd say it's a fine atmosphere for dates.  Either way, 3 of us got the beef burger ($12) and they said it was alright. Another friend got elk, and she also hated it. I got the grilled salmon ($24.75), it was creamy and nice, but lacking flavour. The birthday girl got rib eye steak ($29, on the Autumn menu) and she complained it was similar to beef that was boiled for soup. Yeah, she really hated it. But she liked the yam frites, those were really good. Others got the pork chop, the filet, and the chicken malibu. They didn't complain. I think most of the food can improve a bit with more salt... but that's just me. Overall, I feel that the quality of the food is not exactly worth the high prices, but the prices aren't high enough to deter me from buying them. That makes sense, right?  But the restaurants deserves a 4 * because the service is just so top-notched and amazing. The owner (I think) brought out our cake, sang the happy birthday song with us. Then she went back to the kitchen to cut the cake...and she brought out our cake slices decorated with chocolate syrup. I am touched."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times in the last year.  I love the brunch, and really like the patio in the summer and all in all it's a great place on the street.   Today had lunch with two friends; Tony & Andre;   Tony had the Steak and Eggs - he said it was fantastic and he must of been very hungry cause he ate every spec.  Andre and I both had the California Club, it was on a toasted cranberry & seed bun with a wonderfully moist chicken breast, with red onion, avocado & brie. It was just wonderful ! The cheese melted perfectly on the chicken and all the flavors were perfectly balanced. I had the side salad and Andre the fries.   The only thing I've never liked here is the coffee - it's week and just tastes kind of blah !  Wish I could bring my own coffee in.  The servers are always attentive and very friendly, but the service from the kitchen is always a little slow, but once you get your food it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The waiter was fantastic! The owner or whoever she thinks she is....is not! My husband and I went to this restaurant during Winterliscious to try out their menu. We quickly made friends with one of their regulars...what a pleasant man. Before we could finish our dessert, the \"owner\" asked us the hurry up because the table next to us was \"squished\" (also seemed like regulars as they knew their names and chatted them up). As if that was our problem! Anyhow, after rolling our eyes we took our sweet time because there is no way in H*** that I would ever let anyone who gets my money for a service tell me when I should leave, especially when I am not finished my meal. The \"owner's\" pretentious attitude alone made me feel unwanted. I will therefore never go back. Their food was not great anyways...maybe because it was Winterliscious??? Regardless bad service is really key for me whether you are a restaurant in Yorkville, the Village or a fast food chain. You will never see us again Cafe California."}
{"text":"Seated immediately on a Saturday night, we enjoyed the helpful energy of our waiter.  Started with Dirty martinis and enjoyed them with the patte.  Loved the combination with garlic bread and cranberry jelly.  We then shared the Spinach salad with the dressing on side.  Yum!  David kt mentioning 'the taste he couldn't place' and he realized there was an unusual sesame flavor to the dressing.  Still, very good.  We followed it with the Paella Valencia.  Love love.  The seafood, meats, rice, and spices hit the spot.  We took away one star because we weren't impressed with the Chocolate mousse cake.  It was on the dry side and the mousse seemed more like icing to David.  Overall, we really enjoyed.  Looking forward to what Toronto presents tomorrow.  Oh and the lady who owns the cafe, super cute. We didn't get a special visit, but I was jealous seeing her visit other returning customers.  Loved her energy and enthusiasm for her restaurant.  Oh...and the cute Halloween decorations---I don't think I knew they celebrated Halloween anywhere other than the States!  I'd recommend it, we had a great time :)"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, great people watching. Convenient Village location on Church. Both my husband and I got the \"Summerlicious\" special (only on for three weeks in July) which was $25 for an appy, main course and dessert. My food was pretty good, my husband REALLY enjoyed his.  The Summerlicious special was a great price and I'm happy they had it because everything on the regular menu was, frankly, overpriced. $23.50 for a beef stirfry that I make twice a week at home? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Booked a table at this restaurant for winterlicious after reading all the positive things about it on redflagdeal.. Kind of disappointed with the whole experience.  Food:Took 30 minutes plus to arrive, food is just ok. Portions are very uneven (a lot of mash potato but very little beef?). My boyfriend and I ordered a beef veil and butter chicken. Acceptable meal but for $30, I have been to a lot of other better restaurants.  Ambiance: the worst- the way they put their tables and chairs is unacceptable. I was right at the door and it was so cold... People keep bumping into me every five minutes while I'm eating. I'll not come back again. Ever.  Servers are nice though."}
{"text":"Came here around 1:30pm on a Saturday to grab some sustenance while I waited for friends to make it down to Pride.   I wanted something indulgent and espresso-based to start, and was dissapointed when he said they just had PLAIN OL COFFEE, a bit strange for brunch!  I followed that up with a LIME DAQUIRI which was amazing, but too sweet--no matter, I got an extra shot of rum in it and it became the best daquiri I've ever had!  I also had the CALIFORNIA SALAD with pear, oranges, candied pecans and a delicious balsamic vinnaigrette. It was slightly overdressed, and a slightly smaller portion than I would hope for the price, but very yum.   What made this a 4-star was my amazing server. It was really busy, and because I didn't know how long I'd be there I ordered everything one at a time, making a new request each time he returned with my order. He remained funny, sweet, helpful and very attentive. All of that combined with the second shot in my daquiri resulted in a very large tip, haha, oh $40 brunch, how is it I think I can afford thee?"}
{"text":"Vintage ambiance, good food and great service (the waiters are actually so friendly here). Went for summerlicious. Quite an interesting menu."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious with a group of about 8 people. It was a scorching hot Toronto day, so I was happy that the restaurant was well air conditioned! The setting is pretty basic but looked a bit outdated.  1st course: shrimp with cocktail sauce - I love seafood so was eager to try this dish, but I was quite disappointed. The shrimp were very dry and did not taste fresh. It was clear that the dish had been premise and was sitting with cellophane over top waiting to be served.  2nd course: chicken with mango salsa - this dish was fine. It is hard to mess up basic chicken and mango salsa, so no complaints here.  Dessert - chocolate cake. I was trying to decide between their chocolate cake and the lemon tart, so I asked our waiter for his opinion. He said that the lemon tart wasn't very good, which made my decision easier, but it is always a bit alarming when a server does not recommend a dish (although it is something I appreciate!).  I know that we were ordering from their Summerlicious menu, but it was clear that the dishes and portion sizes were prepared for that purpose. While decent, it certainly wasn't an exceptional experience and it didn't leave me wanting to return."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. Got the Caesar salad (large) with chicken. It literally was lettuce, some dressing, four croutons and some chicken. For $18 I expected something a bit more memorable.  I also got a beer, which was warm, quite an achievement in the current temperature. Left $30 later hungry and unhappy.   Server was nice though. And prompt!"}
{"text":"i was shopping for my husbsnds' Valentines' gift so decided to have brunch here on a Sunday: i have very fond memories of the previous owners who treated you like an extended family member: they greeted with warmly and service was always above & beyond: sadly this is gone now with the now departed previous owners: very poor greeting apon entering now, the tables actually appeared dirty & i was given a beer glass with lip stick on it! the food was ok but there was no atmosphère & i was given a debt machine to pay before i was even finished:  very poor service indeed: i felt rushed to leave even though there were only 2 others patrons present: its' makes me sad to see such a wonderful establishment previosly, now be not a place i will return to."}
{"text":"Visited for a dinner Winterlicious after seeing the decent reviews. In short: pretty good service, pretty good food, could work on their decor. 3.5-4 stars  I ordered the Calamari Diablo, the 8oz Veal Chop and the Apple Crumble Tart. I had plenty of pieces of calamari, it was quite tasty but I didn't like how the sauteed cherry tomatoes made it soggy as I was eating it. Sauce was alright, it wasn't spicy but it was a nice sort of yogurt sauce if anything. The veal chop was tender and I really enjoyed the roasted red potatoes. The pink peppercorn sauce was a nice addition. The apple crumble was alright, it could've been more special honestly. It was just a pie crust with some apples and unbaked crumble on top. Tasted alright, wasn't spectacular.  My partner ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese, the 8oz Filet Mignon and the Amarula Liqueur Cheesecake. There were a few chunks of lobster so that was good, it wasn't just \"lobster-flavoured\", but it was a bit too cheesy.. if that's possible haha. The crostini had a nice garlicky crunch to it. My partner claimed that the filet mignon was one of the top steaks they've ever had as it was super tender even for a well-done piece and it was very flavourful. It was more tender than my veal chop somehow. The mashed potatoes were pretty good and I feel like.. restaurants in general could do better with their vegetables than boil and salt/pepper so it's not just here. We weren't sure what amarula liqueur tasted like so we expected it to be a coffee liqueur, but much to our surprise it wasn't and it wasn't too bad! I just felt like it was a bit heavy even for a cheesecake.  I honestly didn't care for how it was decorated, it looked really old and there was a discoball hanging over the grand piano in the tightest corner of the front of the restaurant. It totally needs an update.  Looking back I did have a lot of complaints but overall it was ok. We looked at the menu outside of their restaurant when we left and saw that it was a little expensive normally so I'm glad I came for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Me and 3 coworkers came here for drinks Friday night, umm, yeah, totally forgot this was more or less, a fancy establishment and thank heavens, we chose to seat in the patio area. Anyways, I can't comment on the food yet cuz well didn't have any.  So we had 2 pitchers of Heineken and 4 shots of Amarula Cream (one each), that pretty much totalled to us to about $100. But the waiters were hella cute according to my coworkers anyways. I'll be back for food next time."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We found out about this place through the posting on Toronto's summerlicious 2017 website. The $28 price and the great menu selection drew us to trying it out!   In regards to the food, we ordered the bruschetta and the spinach/artichoke dip to start. The bruschetta was very fresh; however, it was a little too oily for our liking. The spinach dip was also very savoury and had the perfect amount of spinach taste in it. Dan says it was pretty amazing and super creamy!  For our main course we selected the 8oz Filet Mignon and the Chicken Supreme. The Mignon was very juicy and tasty - although the edges were a little too burnt (not a fan of the charcoal taste). Jenn says the chicken was also pretty juicy and the vegetable stuffing complimented/added more flavour to it!  We went with the Creme Brûlée and the Fruit Crumble for dessert. The brûlée wasn't too sweet, which we loved, but the glaze was a little hard to bite into (again, tasted a bit burnt). The crumble wasn't too sweet either but had a strong berry flavour, which some might enjoy.   As far as the service goes, the waiter was quick to seat us and very attentive - we could not have asked for more.  All in all, if you're looking for a casual, comfortable restaurant to dine in, we would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious on a Friday and this place was pretty busy but you can still find a spot without reserving.  Quality of food: 4/5   I think the menu was really diverse and I was very satisfied with my choices. I had the bruschetta, the 6 oz steak, and the chocolate mousse cake. The steak was average and the bruschetta and cake were quite tasty. My coworkers had the Butter chicken and cheese cake and they were not satisfied. I'd take their advice and stay away from those choices.  Customer service: 2/5   The service here was extremely slow. We arrived at around 12 pm and didn't get to leave until 1:40 pm. As a result, my coworkers ended up being late to their meeting due to the slow service. When we asked to split the bill, the server took about 20 minutes trying to figure it out. That is just embarrassing and unprofessional.    Price and atmosphere: 3/5   The winterlicious menu is $18 for lunch and offers a good variety of choices. The atmosphere is also quite average with nothing really catching my eye.   Overall, I think there are better choices for winterlicious so you won't miss out much for skipping this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time in June 2014 during the World Pride week.  The patio was fairly empty and me and my friend had no trouble securing a table.  It was about 3pm and we were jonesin for a drink.  We ordered as well, the food was very expensive for such a small portion.  I ordered the chicken souvlaki and the lettuce was wilted and should have been tossed out at least 2 days earlier.  The chicken was tough as if the Chef forgot about it on the grill.  I ended up going home with severe stomach pains, and not to be TMI but was uncomfortably needing the bathroom for a while.  I would not recommend anyone come here on a date (how embarrasing would that be if you needed a washroom every 5 min) or if you are going from the restaurant off to another venue and not directly home.  The other horrible thing was they kicked us out of the patio after 2 hours as they said the tables were reserved for people coming to see some event.  I believe it was underwear modelling.  I'm sorry, but never kick people out, offer to move them instead to a non reserved table inside or how about letting us know before we are served that the patio has reserved seating due to a confirmed event starting in a couple of hours? If they did that, i would have rather not eat there as i didn't need to be moved, i wanted to actually stay for a while and settle somewhere as i was trying to catch up with a friend from out of town. Also the patio has a highly reflective stainless steel looking tables.  The glare off them from the sun was extremely uncomfortable i thought i was going to go blind.    *SIGH*  For all these reasons which is frankly enough i would never ever eat here again nor recommend it to friend or foe.  Thanks for a miserable time Cafe California.  Your food and service stinks."}
{"text":"Was heading down Church street seeking Saturday late brunch. Wanted to try a place that I had had on my list which was serving brunch until 4 PM. Went in at 3:40 and was told too late for brunch. So I kept going and found this place just south of Wellesley. It too had a sign out front saying brunch till four. Poked my head in the door and asked if I was too late and the friendly waiter welcomed me in. Had eggs Benedict with salmon and spinach and a Mimosa. Benedict was served on half a croissant and normally I would've preferred English muffin but in fact this does the trick better because there is no chance that there is a hard base caused by an overlooked or cold muffin. With just the right amount of home fries and a tasty small salad this was a great tasty brunch for all in just $19. Fate served me well."}
{"text":"Kudos for making it this far... time to renovate and update.    Make Cafe California great again."}
{"text":"Random stop by, while visiting downtown Toronto.  Summerliscious (price-fix) menu was very good.  Had the toasted ravioli (name does not give it justice, there were some fantastic variants to the typical ricotta filling), chicken with a pineapple and mango salsa, and creme caramel.  Waiter was fun and attentive, but slightly forgetful.  It could be because he new/flirted with many of the customers-which I enjoyed also!  Very good pricing for the quality, atmosphere, and location (church and wellesley)."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Cafe California for the summerlicious menu, and it was delicious; I had the spinach dip, steak and chocolate mousse. The spinach dip was very creamy and flavourful; the fries that was a side of the steak was crunchy and cooked perfectly; lastly - the chocolate mousse was very rich. Overall, the meal was delicious and the price was good - I will definitely go again in the future!"}
{"text":"I tend to allow some leeway when reviewing food that I have ordered via delivery, but this was so bad, that excuse cannot be given. I ordered the California club, my girlfriend the Big Breakfast.   The California club was damn-near inedible, and I was starving. The fries were grossly undercooked, each one was like playing Russian roulette to whether the you could actually bite through it, or not. The club itself was completely tasteless. The cheese? Probably artificial. The chicken? Rubbery. The bacon? Was it even even there?   Now onto the Big Breakfast. Despite it coming with a pancake, there was no maple syrup in sight. The pancake itself was raw, the egg was burnt, and the home fries, much like the regular fries, undercooked. The only upside was the freshly made bread included.   Maybe I was just unlucky, but would not recommend this place, at least for take out."}
{"text":"My friend and I were going to a concert and we wanted to eat a \"hearty\" meal before the concert. My friend had once been to this establishment and really enjoyed it, so I was curious to try it. We arrived at around 2pm for Summerlicious. The restaurant was pretty dead, but it was 2pm after all. There was a family on the other side of the room with a whaling baby. Perfect.   I ordered the Caprese salad for the appetizer, the chicken souvlaki for my main and the creme caramel for dessert. My friend ordered the bruschetta for her appetizer, the stir fry for her main and the chocolate cake for dessert.   We got our food really quickly which was nice. I got my salad and was annoyed with myself from not letting them know to omit the onions. Though nowhere in the description did it say that the salad contained onions. My friend was nice enough to switch with me. The bruschetta was pretty tasty, although the bread was a little soggy. The salad was just a salad. Nothing special about it. It did not have a lot of flavor.   I got my main and again it was swimming in red onions (I removed them and took the picture after so you can't see the onions in the picture). Argh, again! Why did I not tell them no onions. I spent 5 minutes removing the onions. The rice needed salt, the chicken was nice and moist but not enough of it. And then there was the salad that I ultimately did not touch. My friend liked her stir fry, but there was nothing special about it.  I love creme caramel and it's pretty hard to mess it up. We were both satisfied with our desserts. Nothing mind blowing, but not bad either.   So why only 3 stars? The restaurant felt a little depressing. But I am sure the time we chose to have lunch had a lot to do with it. The whaling baby did not help either. But no one could help that I guess. But the food.; it was just okay, and after we left the restaurant I stopped off at a convenience store to buy chips because I was hungry! I don't remember the last time I left a Summerlicious meal feeling hungry."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant during Winterlicious.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, even though they were super busy as the place was packed.  Our lunch included Lobster Mac & Cheese, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Mediterranean Bruschetta, Chocolate Mousse Cake & Cheesecake.  The hot food was really good, made me wanna try their regular menu someday."}
{"text":"I went to this place for Winterlicious 2016 with 5 friends.   I ordered the bruschetta with goat cheese and apple. The others got lobster Mac and cheese, and calamari. The calamari was pretty good. Bruschetta was decent. The lobster Mac and cheese was a bit cold. One bite was warm but the next bite was cold.   Long wait time between food most likely due to Winterlicious. The filet mignon was alright, it wasn't the best filet mignon I've ever eaten. The chocolate brownie was not too moist or crunchy but a little bit in between. I think I like it.   Overall, if it wasn't for Winterlicious, I probably wouldn't come. The price was a bit hefty and I've gone to better."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and tried their Winterlicious dinner menu. Andrew took care of us and he was an absolute gem - super nice, friendly and always made sure to check up on us throughout the meal. With that said, I wish the food was nearly as good as the service.   I got the spinach dip, lamb shank and cheesecake. The spinach dip was meh and served room temp with tortilla chips on the side. The lamb shank dinner came with three small pieces of lamb, mash and veggies. I took a bite of lamb before I found a blonde hair in my mash. We told Andrew and he took it back to the kitchen to \"fix\". When the plate came back, we were told that the \"hair\" was actually thinly sliced onions as no one in the kitchen had blonde hair.  UMMMM, no, I think my dining partner and I can tell the difference between a hair and a slice of onion. But whatever, I'll just pretend like I'm dumb enough to believe it.  Then I went to take a bite of my lamb and low and behold, they just re-plated my meal as I find the original piece of lamb that I took a bite of. Hoping that dessert would at least be good, our \"cheesecake\" came out and it looked like a steamed sponge cake and tasted like an extremely dense and flour-y cheesecake - so not really a cheesecake at all.  Thank you to our server who made the night bearable, but the food is something to pass on."}
{"text":"I've eaten here two nights in a row now. I have to think there were two different chefs/cooks on these nights. Last night I had the Filet Mignon special, and it was excellent. It was cooked perfectly, and the veggies and potato slices were delish! I was going to give this 4 stars but forgot to review. So I came back tonight. Whole different ballgame. The fish and chips were over battered making the fish itself appear large but the fish took up 40% inside. The fries were very oily, and the salad was mushy. I gave this place a 2.5 tonight. A big nothing in terms of places to eat. I don't think I'd risk rating here again unless I knew who cooked the meal last night."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed by the service initially. The tall waiter wearing the baseball cap today is a real \"B\". We were being ignored so we tried to get the attention of the tall waiter and he was in the middle of carrying food. Rather then being polite and telling us he'd be right back, when we said we are ready to order now, he retorted with a curt \"yea, well I'm running food right now\". So disappointed. The food better be freaking garnished with gold dust to rectify my bad day off.  The shorter server was really nice; quick and considerate."}
{"text":"So sad as this is the last standing mom and pop on the strip. Landlords have priced everyone one but chains.   Run down and a bit on the dirty side.   Ordered what looked awesome stuffed pork chop. Presentation was great but it sucked. Canned gravy, tough pork and hard roasted potatoes.   I miss the good old days, this used to be a great standby.   Ps guys at LEAST clean your washrooms..."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The service was worse considering there was only 3 tables occupied in the whole place.  Was asked how we would like our lamb shank cooked. We asked for medium rare and got well down.  Never asked if we would like a second glass of wine.  We both did prix fixe at $29.95 that our original choice of cream brule was not available so we both chose cheese cake because its easy and the whole experience was lacking at best.  Never again. Not worth the wait on a wednesday 7pm."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2016 with 2 of my friends and we enjoyed our food. I had the artichoke dip with bread, steak and veggies, and the creme caramel for dessert.  It was good!!! My friends also enjoyed their food as well. The restaurant gets packed fairly quickly as it is a small space, and it was the last few days of winterlicious at the time. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because the service was a little slow and our table was next to the door so it got a bit cold, but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"Cafe California was suggested by a friend to go to for a Summerlicious lunch.  Am glad i got to experience it. For apprtizer, i got the Cafr California Salad that does not only consist of fresh greens, but also  a nice array of fruits and nuts. There were also a good variety of main dishes to choose from such as steak, salmon, and chicken kebab.  I went for pork chop with gravy.  The portion was big unlike other licious meals that i've had, and the meat was tender and tasty. Last but not least, i ended up with creme brulee.  Pretty good.  Not too sweet.   When it came to the service, it was only ok.  My table was pretty much ignored.  Water refill was scarce and there was confusion when the food came.  Hence the 3 star."}
{"text":"Well! I booked a table for 2 at 6pm for Winterlicious very very last-minute. Luckily, we were the 2nd last table, I didn't think I'd be able to book one for such a popular time too. On the night of, we were late and I had to push the time to 6:30. She very politely allowed that.  So... I usually have alright things to say about Winterlicious restaurants. Food is alright, portions alright, service alright. If the restaurant is terrible, I don't even write a review for them.  But oh here! We were well taken care of. It was a bit cramped though, I didn't like being so close to the other tables. The food wasn't too small, the steak was wonderful, and the desserts were really great too.   I also had a Freezie Martini $7.95 (Raspberry Sour Puss, Banana Liqueur, 7-UP) and it's my favourite now. The restaurant is dimly lit, with romantic by-the-window tables, and many group-size tables. There's lots of energy around you... usually just the friendly waiters making their guests laugh.  Our waiter was so awesome. My boyfriend ordered the same dessert as me, and the waiter jokingly said, \"Don't you want something different to share?\" and then looked to me, \"Gotta watch them straight boys.\" HAHAHAHA!!!!"}
