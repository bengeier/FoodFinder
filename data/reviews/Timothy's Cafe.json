{"text":"Hey folks! Timothy's on Yonge and Finch now has WIFI!  Yay~~~~ (fireworks going off in the background)    My biggest pet peeve these days is no wifi access at a coffee shop.  What's the point right?  They never had it until now. Small space, gets wicked busy here during lunch.  So...  we all know Timothy's, similar to Starbucks, maybe lacking 2% in whatever they are doing.  My favourite is the chai latte here.  I think the best way to describe it would be to say, it's creamier than Starbuck's chai latte?  I come for the patio here during the summer, it's super nice and the building is connected to the subway so real convenient.  And now they have WIFI!! :D"}
{"text":"The service at this Timothys has increase tenfold since they changed hands. Now you're actually served with a smile.  They have a decent supply of K Cups which I've even seen go on sale... funny, my Timothy's never has them on sale. :(  They also sell goodies if you're in need of a morning or midday pick-me-up... oh, and don't the trivia question on the blackboard. Guess correctly and win a free coffee!"}
{"text":"Timothy's still bakes their pastries fresh in the mornings & the smell is still tempts me every time I walk by. The people serving here are always prompt & nice. During the rush hours they usually have at least 3-4 people serving. I still love their savoury croissants but I don't get them as often as I'm trying to eat healthier!"}
