{"text":"Price is too high for what you get and food was just ok. I was told you could not get different meats with the 3 tacos so I got all beef and they weren't great. Employees did not know how to count change so o had to tell them what I was owed for change. Kind of scary. Patio is nice so I might go for a drink but for this type of food I'd go to Cafe Rio for better food at a better price."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time!! Great bar, great service and great fresh food! They just opened and you wouldn't know it!! Crowded but the line goes super fast! Tons of TV's and outside seating! Give this a try... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can start on a positive note and say that Limon was very nice and open seating.  What I was not expecting a chipotle style food selection.   We still gave it a shot and realized that the cost for three tacos was the same if you did a burrito or a bowl.   Unfortunately the wife and I picked street tacos which for the price you are better off choosing the burrito or bowl to qualify as a meal.  Three tacos is normally ok, but 2-3 pieces of dried shrimp or scant traces of asada doesn't cut it.   We've had better luck at some of the Mexican food restaurants that serve asada vs, marinated sirloin sitting in a container in its own liquid.  Again this may be deliberate to get people through the food line faster but the atmosphere of this place warrants a table service rather than a quick heating of a cold corn or flour tortilla.   
Hope they improve on the food as the restaurant selections nearby are slim."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean chic and modern. Ordering is like Mexican subway (like Cafe Rio). Unlike Cafe Rio they severely skimp on the ingredients. I think I had 3 shrimp & 3 paper thin radishes/street taco for $8.50 plus tax! Points deducted for poor value for money. Usually I can't even eat my whole meal and I take half home to eat later. I didn't get close to full 
I love hot food and have been known to order the hottest thing on the menu without issue many times over. This hot salsa was something else!!! My face was on fire to the point I drank 2 whole cups of soda to my usual half. I couldn't even taste my tacos, just burn baby burn. We were still hungry after our meal so we got the chocolate-peanut butter mouse cake. I thought that would quench the burn but I couldn't even taste it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant near my house. I love Mexican themed food, and this place is a more Mexican version of Chipotle. The food is reasonably priced and quite tasty. Also, who doesn't love a margarita. I suggest the prickly pear. Meals for me and the wife generally stay under $25 unless we get drinks. The staff is friendly, and out door seating is really cozy. Great little place."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening last night and was super impressed. Staff were extremely friendly and kept up with the fast paced enviroment. It's hard to compare it to another restaurant because of the variety, freshness and inside outside feel which includes a full bar but if I had to it's an upscale trendy Chipotle. The meat variety and topping selection puts it a step above the competition. They have too many toppings to name but I will call out the fresh pomegranate. They also have a nice draft beer selection including Tower IPA, Corona Light and Dos Equios just to name a few, and I don't want to forget the 3 amigos margaritas. I will definitely be recommending Limon to my friends and family. Excellent new restaurant and concept!!"}
{"text":"I visited Limon for lunch and beers.  Limon has an amazing patio space with an indoor/outdoor bar.  The food is a serve yourself counter burrito/taco/bowl lineup.  The food was a bit disappointing.  There wasn't a lot of flavor in the chicken or toppings selected.  To be fair, the hot sauce was spicy though!  I will definitely go back - there's very few patio bars in the area and Limon's is definitely legit.  I'd also like to try the margaritas as the reviews of those seem pretty positive.  I just ended up wanting so much more from the food."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant & we were not disappointed. We had a lot of choices with the food and it was very tasty.  They offered different salas's, the hot salsa was my favorite.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I would day this place is just ok. It's a take on chipotle but not making the cut. 
Being Latina the flavors just don't jive for me. 
The place is clean, staff is nice. Prices are ok and the margaritas are good. Just don't love the food."}
{"text":"The food is not great at all maybe okay at best. Rather have chipotle, the only reason I gave it two stars because the margarita was delicious and the bartender was super nice. Overall it's not a place I would keep going to. I rather go up the street to norterra and get better happy hour drinks and a way better meal."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were a huge let down. Expensive for Taco Bell quality tacos. We tried the al Pastor as well. Didn't live up to expectations. The meat was poorly seasoned."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for the all day happy hour. The atmosphere was fun and the spicy mango daiquiri was delicious. But I'm giving three stars because I didn't enjoy the food. I had the chips and queso and the pork tacos. The chips and tortillas were a little stale like they had been reheated multiple times. So if you are going for casual fun ambiance and drinks it's nice but i wouldn't have high hopes for the food."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and awesome food on top I've tried 6 different tacos now and it's hard to say which is best."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  The food is good but the prices seem a little high.  The customer service was lacking.  They have a bigger selection than Chipotle's.  My brother got the fish tacos and thought they were really good.  My sister in law got a bowl with beef barbacoa and said she would get it again.  My nephew got the chicken nachos and he loved them.  I got the bowl with the pork al pastor and it was okay.  I thought the pork lacked flavor.  The spicy salsa was very spicy.  The ingredients were really fresh.  I had a glass of wine.  The service at the bar was very good.  I tried the nachos and I thought they tasted more Tex mex than Mexican.  The chicken would be really good with rice.  I only gave this place 3 stars because I didn't think the service was friendly or efficient.  They seemed to assume we had been there before.  There were some inconsistencies.  My sister in law and I both got bowls; I was offered lettuce and not beans while she was offered beans and not lettuce."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great specials every day. Like chipotle but better quality. I go twice a week. Perfect for after a workout as well. Great bar with quality beer and cocktails"}
{"text":"Lots of choices for toppings. Cool environment. I would like to see at least one Mexican person behind the counter (didn't see one that day). I would go back again. Also the tres leches cake was decent"}
{"text":"Fish Fry Friday. My husband had this before and it was crispy and delicious. Tonight both the fish and fries were \"stone cold\" per him. They had the slaw in a container  but did not put in the take out bag. I ordered a bowl. I needed to put in the microwave for a minute as it was barely warm. We live a mile from LIMÃ³N and it is over 110 so not that it cooled on way home. My bowl was good after heated. This was our fourth meal from here. Will return but will stick with bowls."}
{"text":"Food is great. The build your own style serving is great for everyone. I am pretty picky so I loved not having to guess what I was going to like. Atmosphere is great enjoyed sitting on the patio watching the game. Felt comfortable   and very clean."}
{"text":"This is our third visit and we absolutely love the food but this is also our third time witnessing the \"manager\" (and I use the term loosely) behavior. He seats himself at the bar with all of his numerous children and family yelling out orders for more  liquor (high end of course )and food while the bartender is struggling to keep up with orders. Worst of all patrons are waiting lengths of time for their orders while the manager gets his food (probably free)and drink at a steady stream. The owners of Char are awesome and I only wonder if they know that the manager they hired is using their restaurant as his personal kitchen for his family. This is the worst example of management I have ever witnessed. This place has huge potential we only hope it doesn't get ruined by poor management"}
{"text":"We've driven by this place a bunch of times and live close to it. Just tried it for the first time at lunch, and the food was really good. It has a good atmosphere, lots of TVs, a good layout, overall. Staff was nice and my kids love the corn hole game outside."}
{"text":"First off this place is really good! I had three tacos and my husband had three tacos. Mine were chicken, shredded beef and pork. All the meat was good but my favorite was the chicken for sure. My husband had 2 steak and 1 chicken and his favorite was the chicken as well. 
The reason for the 2 star review is because the girl at the start of the line was not very nice and seemed annoyed when we asked her questions. Then while we were going through the line where you add the toppings to your meal the girl who put our toppings on was choosing to use her hands to scoop out ingredients instead of using the utensils provided. THIS SUPER GROSSED US OUT!! I was also worried about the people who have food allergies and the cross contamination aspect. She was in a hurry and seemed annoyed too which didn't help... we also got charged wrong but didn't notice until after we were done with our meal....
But like I said the food was really good. We purchased margaritas from the bar (prickly pear and a regular) and they were great!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and won't be back.  Tacos were tiny and the amount of chorizo put in them was microscopic.  Bowl is not filling.  Food is overpriced, not very tasteful, with small portions.  Guac is placed with items that can be added to a taco or bowl but costs an additional $2.  Layout is confusing.  Chipotle is better."}
{"text":"LIMÃ³N Tacos & Tequila is absolutely DELICIOUS. Talk about a fun, chill atmosphere with great food and a full bar. I love that I can order from a menu then if I'm hungry later, grab a street taco from the other side of the restaurant without having to open a new tab. It's awesome. Can't wait to make this my go-to lunch and dinner spot."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant as they were doing the build-out and we were definitely curious.  After they opened, they seemed to be consistently busy every time we would drive by.  We knew we had to go there and try it.

I have to admit, I peeked at the menu before we went and being a somewhat picky eater, I was a little concerned at first as to what I would choose to eat.  Once we got there and walked in the door, the aroma hits you and you are instantly hungry. I had the a burrito with chicken, brown rice, pinto beans, salsa and sour cream and by boyfriend had chicken street tacos with a variety of toppings on each.  The food was delectable.  We also ordered a house margarita from the bar and a prickly pear margarita and both were excellent. Our favorite is the prickly pear margarita, but they do have many cocktail options.

This is a casual restaurant which I like but it has the bonus of a full bar.  The patio is a great place to hang out and offers games to keep you occupied and plenty of tvs to watch sports if that's what you prefer. 

We have been back numerous times and the staff is always extremely friendly and helpful and take very good care of us.  We have tried several items from their menu including burritos, tacos, chips and queso (their queso is really good) and the cod during their Friday Fish Fry.  Also, try the Limon Lemon Cake... it's to die for!  We are very happy to have this establishment in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If you like your food cold, then this is the place for you. Nobody in line yet it takes them forever to get the food put together. Chips are cold and stale and the meat is bland. This place won't be here in two years."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Very similar to Chipotle, if you like that sort of atmosphere. Definitely a \"been there done that\" sort of place. No need to return for ok food. Too many other restauRants around to try instead."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a new place in area. Stopped by first day and every once in a while since. They started out with some service issues, but I think they have figured it out. Food is very good and the have a nice patio."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely TERRIBLE. I ordered nachos. The chips were stale and they used this nasty white cheese sauce topping. I had to stop eating 1/3rd of the way through. I just couldn't stomach any more.

The one highlight was I found a new beer there that I like. Huss Koffee Kolsch.

Seriously, if you want Chipotle, just drive the extra five miles down to Happy Valley and go to Chipotle. Don't waste your money at this cheap knockoff."}
{"text":"Casual Restaurant with a great atmosphere...customer service could be better in that the staff could smile and say hello! Let me start off by saying the food is not bad but not great either! Lacking flavor and depth that you would expect from Latin style food. Again not bad in a pinch much better than Burger King but definitely wouldn't be my first stop for Latin inspired food."}
{"text":"Concept in interesting...serve yourself food no servers however the margaritas are exceptional, however they lack consistency! My group had the prickly pear, flower power and the firehouse and all were fantastic, but when we ordered a second round salt rims were forgotten as was some garnishes. I feel this place has the potential to succeed but need to focus on consistency and attention to detail!"}
{"text":"It is incredibly similar to chipotle but with more options. The food is a little tasteless but the staff seems to be getting more on top of things. It is also a little more expensive than Chipotle, so you do have that."}
{"text":"So it's like a chipotle style. You choose what you want, like burrito, taco, bowl, etc. then your protein and toppings. 

We got 3 tacos for $2 tacos. They were okay. There's 2 different tortillas to choose from corn or flour. We also got a bowl but it was very dry it needed some type of sauce on it. We also got the nachos with cheese & carne asada & pico (this was the best.) 

Wednesday's kids eat free. 

There's a bar inside & they have a patio. Really nice & clean inside."}
{"text":"So many combos and you can go and splurge and get phenomenal nachos or go on the healthier side and get a bowl. I also love their margaritas and sitting outside on the patio for a nice relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Incredibly unfriendly staff! They do not say hello, they do not ask if you have questions, they just stare at you blankly until you order. When I did ask a question about the beans, the girl looked at me like I was an idiot. The cashier was just as apathetic. I asked where we were to order margaritas and he pointed to the bar--which had no one behind it!! We waited for ten minutes for them to find someone who could make drinks! The food was average at best. The salsa was very good and the margaritas were good as well. It is a beautiful space with an awesome patio, so it's a shame they have such poorly trained employees. The way we were treated legitimately ruined the experience. We won't return--we'll go back to our fave Plaza Bonita next time, where everyone has a smile on their face!!"}
{"text":"What a great idea.  I love the fast casual concept that gives you plenty of reasons to hang out.  I will admit I'm partial to patio restaurants but I wasn't expecting the corn hole, Foosball and a bar you could belly up to.  The staff was friendly and the prices were great.  I read a couple of other reviews that were less than glowing about the prices but I think the prices were great for what you get.  I was there with my wife and 2 kids and we all loved what we had and the portions were generous.  Not only did the staff not flinch when asking for toppings they encouraged us to get whatever we wanted.   And it was all included for the base price.  My nachos were piled high with chips, queso, chicken and about every other topping imaginable for less than $8 bucks.   I couldn't believe it.  This is our new go to place."}
{"text":"We live in the area so decided to try it out one weekday night for dinner. When I walked in it it reminded me of a Chipotle with a bar. Nice concept however, the customer service was terrible and the food was cold and flavorless. We walked up to the order line,no one was in front of us, and informed the young lady we had never been in. She just blankly stared and said to let her know when we were ready to order. We looked at the menu and decided on what we wanted. I had a rice bowl with chicken and a couple of sauces. When I sat down my chicken and rice were cold, I asked my son if his tacos were good he said his tacos were cold too. Once we tasted the food we agreed we would not be returning to this place which is unfortunate considering we live so close. The chips used on my sons kids meal were stale. Overall this place was not worth trying! What a waste the place looks decent from the patio. Maybe the bar is what is keeping the place running because it most definitely is not the food or service."}
{"text":"Tacos are great!  Nachos are great!  Love the huge selection of toppings.  Must try the prickly pear margarita!  The bar and yard area is great for a group or date night and the inside is great for a quick casual meal with the kids!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. The food was great! I just wish there was an option to sit at the bar and have a sushi style \"here's a pen and paper, what would you like?\" type checklist for stuff for picky eaters, instead of waiting in line \"chipotle style\" ordering. Sometimes I just want a chicken quesadilla or bean burrito! Let's be real, sometimes we are looking for fast food, and sometimes we want to be waited on! How about both? Needless to say, I think all employees were on point. They came by twice to bus our table, but not in an annoyingly way, and also didn't sit with a dirty plate in front of me for more than a couple minutes. I got tacos and nachos. The tacos were small,(I guess depending on how much you like on tacos), but tasty (you get 3 for like $9-10 after tax)! The nachos were great, but I should have asked for extra cheese! The queso was bomb! Next time I'll try a burrito. I told the bartender Ashley to surprise me with one of the signature drinks, (with the suggestion, \"I love tequila and sweet stuff!) and she made me a Flower Power Margarita. It was amazing..and took me out of the box a little bit! I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was crusted to the side of the serving dishes. Overpriced for what you get. We spent $50 and got Taco Bell type food."}
{"text":"The burritos are SOOO good! Thank you!!! I no longer need to fly back to San Francisco for my burrito fix!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere is excellent but they need to put a cushion at the bottom of the connect four game outside so that you don't go into shock when the pucks fall, it is unbelievable how loud it is.

Great weekly deals!"}
{"text":"Chipotle with a bar, the restaurant has a two-step process.. you go through the food line then find a seat, then order drinks from the bar. I find the process sloppy. BUT the food was good, drinks were good and the atmosphere is great. We live in the neighborhood and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible. Major cross contamination with food. I let them know I'm allergic to fish and they would need to change gloves if they handle other foods. I literally saw 2 girls handle fish & didn't want to change gloves before they handled my food. I eat many other establishments that serve fish & don't have issues. Asked several different times for other toppings on my tacos & never got. Finally gave up as it was clear they weren't going to listen. Meat was tasteless, guacamole was tasteless, cheese was tasteless. The owner or manager whom happened to pull up in a new corvette ironically came up to our table before we left. Showed general concerns but obvious nothing will come of it. I hope they can survive on their liquor license. If I could give them zero stars I would simply because I let them know of an allergy & they didn't care."}
{"text":"I was very excited to check out but ended up disappointed.  I assumed it was going to be a little more authentic, it's very similar to Chipotle food was okay, margarita was very weak.  

May give it another try but I would rather drive a little further to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great place to get a healthy \"Cali-Mex\" meal... everything is fresh and tasty.  I've been there a few times.  I do think they close really early 9:00pm weekdays  ... or so it seems... but ultimately north Phoenix needed more healthy casual fare and limon is a great option."}
{"text":"This place is very live during evening hours. Its sort of like a Chipotle but on steroids. They serve alcohol, beer , etc. I really like the margaritas! They have some outside games and flame lamps. The place is family friendly but really geared towards adults. It's the ONLY one in Phoenix. The seasoned chicken is really the only meat i get on my food when I go. I always ask for a sample while I'm waiting in line....WHO CARES?! Lol. I really recommend you get the chicken with the street tacos. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"So... a definite learning curve. The bar has a bar food menu. Don't walk in and try to put all the work into navigating the walk in Chipotle type line if you want to sit at the bar. Felt like maybe we annoyed the barmaid doing just that. Also, Do you still go get your silverware if you are delivered your food at bar? Guy who ordered and was delivered bar food was looking around like, \"now where are my utensils?\" I directed him while bar maids looked on. 
The cocktails were good. I had \"La Mula de la Droga\". 
The food was alright. I wanted beans and rice and choose the quinoa rice but was told i couldn't have \"bean and rice\" side but had to pay separate for beans and rice. Paid extra for guacamole. Whatever. It was over confusing and made more confusing by young barely trained salad bar workers. Food not being pushed down the line- getting out of order- orders not being communicated person to person. Customer trying to sort out what the hell they are doing. Its all a lot work for $30 bucks spend on two orders of street tacos not including drinks. Overall a good concept without the elbow grease to grease the cogs of the machine."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had,  the nachos are also amazing. Great personality behind the bar, fantastic margaritas. Such a good environment."}
{"text":"Quality of food is hit or miss depending what time of day you go. Rice in my Limon bowl was not cooked all the way during last visit. Still hoping it will get better."}
{"text":"Sigh. I'll try to be fair with this review because I was not expecting this place to be what it is. I was SO excited to finally have a spot around here with a cute outdoor space and some good food/drinks that wasn't your typical chain. Imagine my surprise when I walked in to discover this is essentially a more expensive, slightly fancier chipotle. The concept is confusing and doesn't match the vibe of the place. The food is good, everything was fresh but only option for vegetarians is fajita veggies. You pay extra for slightly fresher chipotle in a ceramic bowl versus the cardboard. Once you get your food, you take your tray and go to the awesome bar area. It's just awkward...now I'm in this super cute outdoor space with a more upscale vibe, half indoor half outdoor bar with my cafeteria tray of fancy chipotle...fine, I can get over it. Then you go to the bar separately to order a drink, which is again awkward. I got 2 margaritas, they were good but mostly ice and really weak - stone cold sober after two. I am going to go back and try them again for the margs, everyone has good things to say so maybe it was a fluke or I didn't get the right one. I would love to see this place do away with the chipotle concept and do more of a sit down thing. They could even make it more casual with the sushi style ordering as someone else mentioned - maybe they could have you check on a piece of paper what you want and put your meal together that way. All this said, will try them again for their drinks, sit in the outdoor area and try to pretend the tacky buffet style chipotle section doesn't exist."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Limon. Tonight was friends and family night. Looks to me like they are good to go."}
{"text":"I thought the staff was friendly and the place clean. Prices are low and taco flour fresh as were the toppings. Problem for me was the pork, beef and black beans were cool at best. No cheese would melt on them. The fried cod was made to order so was the best."}
{"text":"My son and I tried this place last night.  The food was awesome - loved it.  I suggest though that they change the glass between the customer and the food preparers.  Every time I asked them a question, I could not hear their response.  They had to respond multiple times and I could tell it was annoying for them as well as me.  The glass should be slanted or lower or they need to be higher than the glass so we can hear them.  It was very frustrating.  The food was delicious, the only other thing I would suggest though is to double up the corn tortillas on the street tacos so they don't fall apart, but they were definitely very tasty!  I just needed a fork to eat them.  My son had a beef burrito with all the mixings and he loved it.  They even had ketchup for him!  Most places don't have ketchup or ranch and that is what he likes on his burritos.  The chips were yummy and loved all of their salsas and pico de gallo.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today with my daughter.  We almost did not go because of the recent reviews, but we are glad that we did.  The restaurant is very nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.  It is a Chipotle setting, but with many more options.  The restaurant is environmentally friendly and the food was reasonably priced.  Will definitely go again and tell friends."}
{"text":"The food was good! Atmosphere is nice, and I thought the employees were friendly. They just need to work on speed, which will come in time. Convenient for me and my husband because we live 2 minutes away and we love tacos! Try the nachos! You customize it the way you want which I thought was pretty cool and unique!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is amazing!! The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is always very friendly, attentive, and smiling! I would definitely recommend this place if you love tacos! I definitely recommend trying the white pablono queso!! AMAZING  the bar makes awesome drinks too!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here weekly since opening and the food is always great! While the food is good, the customer service has gone downhill. The portions are never the same, I see the guy in front of me get 3 scoops of steak while I have to ask for extra to get the other half of 1 scoop of chicken. I understand portion control but every order should be treated equal regardless of dining in or taking out. If portion control is important, then have measuring cups to ensure the correct amounts are getting placed on each order. The eye rolling when asking for a little more than a tiny sprinkle of something isn't necessary. The staff clearly doesn't know how to interact with customers which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Just another bad attempt at knocking off Chipotle. I was excited to see a new restaurant enter the area but this place is a complete disappointment. Food is bland and has zero flavor to it. We had a party of four and none of us finished our food. It was just gross. While ordering it looked like the food had been sitting out all day. Food service area was very dirty, employees use their bare hands to grab ingredients without washing hands first. Employees didn't look like they wanted to be there and prefer having private conversations while serving you rather than paying attention to what the customer is ordering. I will not be returning and would not recommend this place at all. In all fairness, I didn't try the bar so maybe the drinks are good."}
{"text":"In town from SLC, UT visiting my parents.  Mom was craving street tacos, and I found Limon on yelp.  The current 3 star rating is bogus in my opinion.  The Carne asada beef, epic.  Lime shrimp, awesome. Pork carnitas, delicious. Chicken adobado, my least favorite, but still damn good!   Cool atmosphere. Soda Machine, and a bar.  Fast friendly service. I'll be going back here again.  I need somewhere like this nearby back home"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I didn't leave feeling like \"oh I'm going to crave this place and have to go back\". I visit Taco Bell more than this place. I don't have anything memorable to say about the taste of the food...bland. The store was clean and it seemed like they were really trying to be successful. This is a new business in my neighborhood, so they have some room to improve. I like the design and layout of the store etc. It was clean and the staff seemed fairly friendly. I think they could learn a thing or two from the pizza place down a few doors on what smile and friendlier service can do. I don't see this place packed like it should be. Raise your standards and become exceptional and your customer base will grow. Your customers want a best in class service, so strategically think of how you can improve."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  We were excited to try out this new spot and left wondering how long it'll be around.  It's a chipotle with a bar, that doesn't have the food figured out yet.  Both our entrees were cold, and the cod I had was chewy. Maybe the time of day we went was between batches of fresh buffet line items, but that shouldn't matter, I don't think the kids building the food behind counter really cared either.  I couldn't eat my bowl so ended up ordering something else and still left hungry, so did my husband.  Total waste of money!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this local bar.  I dreamed of sitting on the patio, ordering a drink and a bite to eat while watching a game on TV.  I was very disappointed to learn it's just a Chipotle with a separate bar area offering beer and margaritas.  We were there on a Sat around 1:30pm.  We were the only ones in line.  It took 15 LONG minutes to get through the line and sit down.  Surely there are better employees available or maybe someone to train the current ones.  There were 5 employees behind the counter and not one was friendly, helpful, or efficient.  By the time we took our seats, the food was barely lukewarm.  I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Very unspectacular.  Average food and service.  While we were excited for another restaurant choice in the north valley, this is a little bit of a disappointment.  I would say this is an overpriced Chipotle with lukewarm ingredients."}
{"text":"My buddy and I came here today for lunch to celebrate a new job he got.  I really wanted to like this place a little more than I did.  Perhaps I should have read the past reviews of some of my fellow Yelp'ers before indulging.  

First, it's a fairly new spot, I guess and not busy at all.   We arrived at 11:30 or so this morning.  Tons of ample parking and a very clean parking lot on the north end of town right off Dove Valley.  Very, very convenient location.  The restaurant was clean, the employees were friendly and attentive and the restrooms were equally clean.  The decor is bright and vibrant.  It's a good chill spot you could probably hang out at after a long day at work.  Despite the word \"tequila\" in their name, I did not have any tequila.

So.... the food.  I opted for (3) street tacos which is an item on their menu.  Like some of my fellow Yelp'ers stated in their reviews, I was hoping this place would have been just a tad more authentic.  Don't get me wrong.  What Limon does, they do very well, but it's typical Qdoba / Chipotle fare with not a whole lot of authentic-ness (I totally just made that word up.)  Perhaps I was expecting a bit more and perhaps I put them up on a pedestal a bit higher than I should have.  My corn tortillas fell apart quite easily.  The pork carnitas was almost 'wet' in a way.  Very difficult and odd to describe, but it was not the typical carnitas that you would be used to here in Arizona.  The pico de gallo was quite fresh, but lacking a lot of flavor.  Their hot salsa was neither hot nor flavorful, but again, I just think perhaps I was expecting a bit more and Limon fell just a hair short of what I wanted for lunch today.  I think stacked up against a Chipotle or Qdoba and Limon is at home among these lunch contenders.  But when I think of authentic street tacos, this is not the place I would recommend when trying to entertain or impress out of town guests.  

In all fairness, perhaps it was an off day.  Despite my expectations being unfulfilled, the restaurant is very clean with plenty of ample indoor and outdoor seating areas.  The floor was clean and the employees were friendly and polite.  Perhaps I will give Limon another try in the near future, but with so many awesome and authentic restaurants here in the Valley - unfortunately, it may not be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice to have a local food and watering hole. Beer and margarita selections are good. Food is chipotle style with fresher options"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere, love the patio seating. But food is not that good and prices to high. Tried it twice."}
{"text":"The food itself is good - the margaritas are very good.  Been there four times and figured there will be some growing pains as the staff behind the food counter always seems lost...but they have been in business over 6 months and if they don't have this figured out by now they probably never will.
1)  The staff seems clueless - they are high school kids ( I get it I worked in food also during those years) but poorly trained. The bucket (buffet style) behind the counter which held the chicken also held about a third of grease.  The girl who scooped the chicken into my taco shell had the scoop filled with grease A LOT OF IT - and did not drain it before putting this mess into my tacos.  They use paper lining for their taco plates and when the grease and paper mixed while I was trying to eat...well you get the picture.  Maybe....drain the grease before you put the chicken in the bucket in the first place...but what do I know?
2)  No mild sauce available - the bowl was empty.  I get it sometimes you run low on supplies - this can be excused...however.  The guy behind the counter said that they had some mild sauce (and pointed to it 20 feet away)  then looked at me.  I said \"I guess I'll take medium\" and got it.
3)  When asked what I wanted for toppings the girl scooping stuff up kept trying to put sour cream into my taco even though I told her TWICE I did not want it.
4)  You get the obligatory receipt at the register and they ask for a tip....I almost had to laugh - you get a tray and get your own drink and then throw your own trash away- like Panda Express or something.
5)  The bar - which can be opened up is great... but they wont open it unless you ask - and then in sections.  They say to keep the flies out - if they do open it up get ready for a fan on you the whole time.
I live down the road and want to see it succeed - but they have been in business for 6-7 months and can't figure this stuff out? I really hate to give this place a bad rating - but if they read any reviews and can change I hope it helps."}
{"text":"You have to take it all in before you order.  You can order so much. Idk how many combinations you can make. But it's more then twenty less then a million. 
If you don't like something it's cause you messed it up lol.

It's your choice of base and then load on toppings had heard some thing's didn't experience them. Portions where a lil big, but that's cause I added to much. I was hungry & in full fat kid mode! 
 
Left to right: 
Chicken, cabbage, pickled onions, green salsa. Tasty and will do again!

Middle Street Corn, Barbaco, and Pico. By far my favorite! 
Just no Pico Next Time.

Steak, cabbage, corn, mango salsa, pickled onions. 
also good. Only tweak no corn, no cabbage and amazing for sure.

 I'll be back $2 taco Tuesday is Legit & #notskimpy. if I had chips would have had nachos from what fell out of my overflowing 's."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect combination of a cool environment and great food! All the ingredients tasted fresh and they have a ton of choices to build your own taco, burrito, bowls, etc. The manager even came out to make sure we were enjoying it! The bar is super cool as well set up with heaters and an awesome outdoor space!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, the food is great, but it lacks customer service. It's unfortunate because you know a lot of money has been spent. The business is ran by a bunch of teenagers you hear complain about their schedule or even drama going on in the kitchen. No professional manner, the difference between here and chipotle is Chipotle has customer service and not a bunch of kids running it."}
{"text":"Food was super good, staff was friendly. The add of the bar is a great touch, patio is nice and TV's everywhere.  We will be coming again soon."}
{"text":"Wife and I came after getting a coupon in the mail. We had heard mixed reviews, but we really liked it. She had shrimp street tacos and really liked them. I just had a burrito with chicken and it also was good. We sat at the bar and service was great. Bar tenders are very attentive and nice. It's like a Chipolte but on steroids. Great atmosphere and a nice outdoor bar. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Well well well....what do we have here!? A fresh looking place with Mexican food and drinks, IM IN! A set up similar to Chipotle but with a lot more options. Tacos, burritos, tortas, and of course bowls. I ventured to the the bowl life as it was recommend by staff because I was starving. I went white rice, double chicken, and a ton of veggies. What's cool is the Mexican veggie options like pickled onion, and cotija cheese. They have this sweet corn that was pretty flavorful. 

Did I mention drinks...when I say drinks I mean alcoholic beverages including a full bar with draft beer. We sat on the outside patio at night which was extremely pleasant. I had a four peaks 22 oz to go with my bowl and I was full! Come check it out, however beware they close at 10. Super bummer! Besides that I'm definitely going again, see ya ther"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  Good food, reasonable prices- great neighborhood spot to grab a bite or a drink."}
{"text":"So it has margaritas and tequila. So what? It's a Chipotle's. With flies. Carnitas were ok. Tacos? Ok. Nachos? Ok. The queso? Gross. Not a place to go back to. I prefer Chipotle's."}
{"text":"Great food. More options than Chipotle and better food. Great bar and atmosphere! Great for kids!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place open up. What a let down. The food is bland and overpriced. My burrito looked like half of a burrito and was wrapped carelessly and was falling apart. My wife ate two bits of her bowl. Honestly Chipotle is way better. The full bar and margaritas are good but don't eat here."}
{"text":"It is Chipotle but you wait in line for 45 minutes... When I sat down to eat my food boy was I disappointed to find out my meal was already cold. Guess I shouldn't have been surprised. My meal was sitting on their counter for too long waiting for the line to move. Ownership needs to either iron out the kinks or change their business model to more of a sports bar style. I am not the only person who has had this type of experience. Look at the other reviews."}
{"text":"I do not think I will eat here again got take out, shrimp and carne bowls. Got super sick from the food. No Bueno"}
{"text":"It was great for first night being open. The kids liked the nachos. It's a family restaurant meets sports bar with a great patio. Excited to go back. Congrats to the owners!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber eats and the food had absolutely no flavor.  Super disappointed because I Looooove tacos."}
{"text":"I have tried this place 3 different times since it opened. It's a cluster! Teenage food service handlers who clearly didn't pay attention during their course because the cross contamination in this place is rampant! When I called the worker out for handling meat and then patting down my rice for a vegetarian bowl she looked at me like I was insane. The line barely moves with their one quesadilla press and the staff just stands idling waiting for cheese to melt. My bowl tonight was luke warm, not even hot enough to melt the \"sprinkle\" of cheese they added. The topping selection is great, but they barely put any on your meal...it would be nice if they gave you enough to actually taste! Kids meal quesadilla...if you add meat it's no longer a kids meal....you have to pay for an adult meal. This place is a total disappointment. I will not be back! Disappointed is an understatement."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!!!

The food here tastes very fresh and tastes great. 

I had the nachos with carnitas and a bite (or two) of chicken burrito.

The carnitas had good flavor and was very shredded. I liked that there were not big fatty clumps of pork. The queso was the star and they provided a generous portion of this white heaven.

The bites of burrito I had were also good.

Service was great.

One star lost for guacamole up charge for nachos. For me guacamole is an\"extra\" on all entrees but nachos. Should be included with nachos IMHO"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, very young staff seemed kinda lost and dis-interested in general, didn't know difference in salsas... asked for Salsa Verde and they started to put the pico on there (it's the green one). Chicken was over-salted, the white cheese which was drenched all over the nachos was pretty gross and ruined the dish. In all, probably won't be back, seems a touch over priced. Country music was playing super loud throughout, wasn't sure what they were going for. Maybe it was an off morning for a Saturday."}
{"text":"You've found a Limon... 

The owner should pray that the health inspector doesn't come any time soon as the staff have forgotten their food handling safety classes. Lettuce that had fallen out of a taco was scooped back into the lettuce bin after touching meat. Meat that had been in a customers burrito was put back into the meat bin. A burrito was wrapped by hands not in gloves. Gloves were wiped off instead of getting new gloves after they were contaminated. Let's just say I've seen enough. I won't be back. Disappointed as it sounded like a fun restaurant concept."}
{"text":"Come for the bar, definitely not the food. Had soggy tacos three times before I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Qdobe or Chipotle with tequila. Inconsistent servings... my wife's nachos were huge, my street tacos miniscule. For the money - get the nachos. Lowering prices and improving some of the serving sizes will save this place because it's otherwise bright, clean and friendly. And has a decent margarita. Me? I'd rather pay similar money at a restaurant where the wait staff serves guests at table rather than wait in line cafeteria-style. Lines are always rushed and they are, well, lines."}
{"text":"Got street tacos. Topping selection is nice and everything seems to be super fresh. If it's organic that would be amazing... not really worth the price though. Got two orders of street tacos and medium drink for $19. I mean it's good but completely reminds you of chipotle as soon as you walk I. For the price I would expect some type of free app or something to come with the meals."}
{"text":"While the food is not necessarily bad, the way it is prepared is just gross. The tray on which my wife's nachos were about to be made had food on the liner and all the white bowls they use for rice or salad had bits of old food in them. The staff then uses their plastic gloves to pick up the various cheeses, veggies and toppings. That might be fine if they changed them for every order, but they don't. They then touch trays, receipts, the counter and other things, then touch your food with those same gloves. They should use spoons or tongs to avoid cross contamination as well as getting other germs in the food every time they touch non food items. 

Sorry to say I won't be back. The concept is nice, but unless their prep method is changed it's too gross to think about eating there again."}
{"text":"It's very clean and delicioso the food is so good and the this street corn saled is to die for I'm gonna be coming back with my family and the stuff are all so nice."}
