{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed the food here. The shakes were delicious and presentation decadent.  My husband I loved the music playing in background and the volume was perfect. We got burgers cooked just as we ordered and I got a Cesar salad with a beef patty. House sauce recommended and definitely didn't disappoint.  Overall, definitely a great place to get together for good food and desserts! I give them 4 star"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  music was bangin the whole hour we was there.  We knew all the songs playing.  Booth for four people was great space.  Food:  chicken wings was decent,, just right if your not to full and don't want a big meal and want to save space for the MONSTER SIZE MILKSHAKES!!!  THE SALAD BURGER and sweet potatoes fries F- ing AMAZING!!! Definitely a must try!  Milkshake:  Had the Oreo Milkshake and Cotton Candy Milkshake!!! Both shakes presentation is in a class by themselves; the Oreo comes with ONE BIG A** COOKIE and taste soooo Out OF this WORLD!!! COTTON candy was just Rich with candy and the cotton candy so fluffy!!  Overall:  This place is a must to visit and try"}
{"text":"I sat directly at the bar and the service was decent, although I did specifically go there for the cotton candy shake and the bartender tried to talk me out of it. I appreciate his honest opinion, but I needed to try it. The food fell very short of expectations. My burger was nice and pinkish red on the inside, but extremely charred on the outside, which made it very dry and IMO inedible. I only had 3 bites and couldn't eat any more. The fried pickle chips were extremely salty. I believe it was in the batter because the sliced pickle I got on the side of the burger was not salty at all, in fact it hardly had any flavor. My cotton candy shake was awesome to look at. It was simply a strawberry shake with cotton candy and other bits of candy all over as decoration. The strawberry shake itself was good. I did enjoy the candy, but nothing creative on the flavor profile. Over all, I would probably never go back."}
{"text":"Came specifically for the gourmet milkshake selections and it did not disappoint! I knocked down 1 star because it's right by the sports betting area and poker tables, where the waiting line starts, so it wasn't an ideal location for the kids. Nonetheless, the milkshakes were enjoyed and be prepared for that sugar coma to kick in quick!"}
{"text":"We went to Black Tap last night for my son's birthday.  The menu is slightly pricey, but given that it is on the strip, not completely out of bounds.  The food quality justifies the price, however.  Where I give the five stars, is with the level of service.  Our server was very responsive and seemed to be a genuinely kind person.  We had a couple of hiccups with the meal, and the staff was extremely responsive and went to great lengths to ensure that we left as satisfied customers.  We did and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and their milkshakes are completely out of this world!! That along with the amazing and extremely knowledgeable wait staff makes me want to come back again and again!! Their outside patio is located right next to the gondola lake (at the Venetian) and the view of this with the Strip in the background is so beautiful! I'm a local and usually don't come down to the Strip, but for a lunch or dinner at this venue I'll come down to the Strip any day!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all of the hype is about. The service was awful and the food was not edible.  The only upside part was the Crazy Shake.   While our intent was to only order a shake, we decided to start out with some snacks.  That was an epic mistake and a total disaster.   We ordered the mozzarella sticks and they didn't have any cheese in it. They were empty!!   Then we decided to order the wings and they were raw.  Completely raw! The only part that looked cooked was the outside.   We came for the Cake Shake and it was outstanding!! I liked how they put the icing on the outside of the cup and put sprinkles on it. The cake on top was delicious and the shake itself was amazing.  We did have a great booth because we were right next to where they make the shakes and it was cool to watch them prep and make the shakes.  The service. Was not very good either.   We had dirty plates on our table for 15 minutes and dozens of employees just walked by completely ignoring them.   The waitress was pushing us to get our shake before we were ready and was really worried after our food mishap, as she should be.  The most comical part was when she told us that the cheese evaporated from our cheese sticks.     I know that I won't be going back to that place.   While the shake was good, Las Vegas offers much better options for dining and desserts with better service."}
{"text":"Plant-based review, no meat burger or dairy shake ordered. Although this place is known for their unique fun shakes or tasty meat burgers, I didn't order either and still had a pretty good experience here.   ORDERED * Vegan Burger & Quinoa Bowl (black bean patty, kale, cucumber, avocado, salsa verde, cilantro, lemon dressing, pickled onions) * Crispy Brussels Sprouts (sesame-tahini sauce)  PROS  + Both items ordered were absolutely delicious + Fun, atmosphere and it being inside The Venetian is a huge plus + Entertaining to watch the barista create the funky shakes   CONS - A bit pricey in my opinion. I think it was around $16 for the salad and $10 for the appetizer but then again this is on the Las Vegas strip - I asked for an extra dressing to-go and they charged me $1 - Waitress overcharged us on accident so we had to wait an extra 15 - 20  minutes for her to resolve the issue  Being a Vegas local I typically eat off the strip since there are so many amazing places to choose from. The food here was very tasty but I don't think I would go out of my way to dine here again since their vegan options are extremely limited."}
{"text":"Good quality food, friendly staff and clean open environment! They don't take reservations so make sure you plan ahead if you're going on a weekend. Bar as well as outside patio seating available. Kid friendly too and great old school pop music!   Plan for about $50/person (with tip) if you have a burger and shake"}
{"text":"The place has really cool vibes and decor. I had the All-American Burger with fries and it was delicious (neglected to get a picture because of how hungry I was). My brother and I split the Cake Shake and it was by far the best I've ever had. If you're going to splurge on burgers in Vegas, this is the place to do it. Will be back next time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"It was a nice day to sit outside with a view of the gondolas and the LV strip but first annoyance is that the table was wobbly. This place hasn't been open for very long so that means they bought cheap tables that wobble. Of course we had to order the infamous $15 shake, tried the chocolate chip cookie shake. It was good, but was brought out at the same time as our appetizer which I guess is ok but would have preferred to be asked when I want my shake. Burger was good, fries were too salty . The most outrageous part of the bill was a dollar charge for each side of ranch. I've never heard of a charge for ranch EVER! I hate restaurants that upcharge without letting the customer know. Very sneaky and leaves a bad taste. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"After a long and stressful day at the Airport trying to make it out to Vegas before the \"Bomb Cyclone\" I am grateful that Black Tap is now in The Venetian. As soon as I got checked in and got to my room, my best friend recommended we run down to Black Tap since we were starving and needed food before getting into more stereotypical Vegas fun.   I ordered the Chili Cheeseburger and watched in fear as I saw what they are famous for being prepared. These huge milkshake mountains are insane and they have a ton of variety in terms of what kind you can order. I went with one covered in Fruity Pebbles and candy and whipped cream and cherries and everything and sugar and you get the point. Needless to say my tummy was feeling a bit bloated after the fact but it was my own decision and I stand by it.   Definitely give this place a try if you are near it and if you love burgers, fries and massive milkshakes that could probably solve a lot of the World's problems."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant/bar. We ordered a burger and a shake - both delicious. They seemed a bit short staffed, as we tend to like a little more server attention then we received, but overall - would highly recommend! Prices were fair"}
{"text":"Cake Shake!!!! It's as good as it looks lol...on a Monday night we waited maybe 20mins to seat outside,the shake was amazing and definitely worth it lol"}
{"text":"Milkshakes looked amazing but was a bit overrated. I was recommended to try by coworkers. For the price not worth it."}
{"text":"Very friendly Las Vegas. It's like your neighborhood place. Good food, great service and if course the Crazy Shakes. My son's favorite. I like the selection of craft beer and sampled the North Coast Scrimshaw Pilsner. Excellent beer.  The restaurant has their service pat, from the hostess desk to service. Enjoyed The experience so we came back twice during our stay."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas decided to finally try Black Tap which has obviously been an instagram favorite for their decadent milkshakes. Disclaimer, I didn't actually try the milkshake because I think given the size of that thing you really need to come just for that and we were looking for dinner!  To start we shared the brussel sprouts app, which was deep fried and then came with a tahini lemon dipping sauce. The sauce was super unique and the veggies were fried to perfection. Highly recommend.  I ordered the mexican burger with a turkey burger patty. It was yummy, had pickled jalapenos, a fried onion ring and a chipotle mayo with cheese. I really like the buttered bun and overall it was a good burger that hit the spot. However, I have had better turkey burgers (less dry, more flavorful) My boyfriend got a regular beef burger with mushrooms, onions and cheese. He really enjoyed his and while I didn't try it he said he would come again for the burgers. The fries were okay but nothing special. They could try and jazz those up given that they are a craft burger place, maybe make the fries a little more \"crafted\" as well.  Sitting at the bar, we had a great experience. All the servers were AWESOME. Super friendly, attentive (constantly filling my water glass) and just overall a very welcoming bunch. Loved the decor and the 90s/00s music they were playing.  Ambiance gets a 5/5  Food 3.5-4/5  So I'd average the experience a 4/5. Next time I need to come back and try the milkshakes (if only for the picture :)"}
{"text":"I found this place on Pinterest, and the milkshakes do not disappoint. The one I picked had a homemade cookie sandwich with ice cream and icing holding it all together. Then the milkshake had vanilla ice cream and chocolate and it was so good...no shortcuts here!"}
{"text":"The shakes were tasty. Definitely a share option if you can all decide on one flavor."}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious burgers and fresh fries! had the veggie black bean burger and falafel burger ."}
{"text":"It would have been nice to be able to sit somewhere while waiting in line for almost an hour!  The decor was impressive -- a lot to look at; murals on every wall. Great music choice/playlist going, but I wasn't a big fan of it being so loud, I could barely have a conversation.  Initially, we came in for one of their famous signature shakes, but we actually ended up deciding to get food. I ordered the Californian with a black bean patty, and omg, it was ahhhmazing. There's just something about that truffle mayo that made it 10x more better.   Ended our dinner with the Cake Shake -- to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of that either. The presentation was great, but it was just too much going on and too sweet. I think I got diabetes from just looking at it. I mean, if you've got a sweet tooth, by all means, go for it.  A bit pricey, but that was expected considering the fact that it's located in one of the casinos on the Strip. The portions are fairly decent sized, so I'll give them that. Overall, great presentation and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Amazingly huge shakes! Very creative way to consume a million calories. They are as good as they look, but bring friends. You won't be able to eat one alone!!"}
{"text":"First time here at this restaurant and was by far one of the best experiences I have ever had. Our waitress was beyond kind, friendly, and outgoing. The manager Josh, came over to introduce himself and we all had a great time getting to know him and his life experience in the restaurant industry. I look forward to making this place mandatory stop on my Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had a party of 6, as were celebrating my youngest 21st birthday.  When we first arrived we checked in and the stood in line. I was expecting to wait at least 30 to 45 min, but they got us in pretty quick, I think wait time totalled 10min. The atmosphere of this place is very upbeat. The music was loud, but enjoyable. The food was very good. My husband and I had the Mexico city burger, now we're not big meat eaters,  but we had to try. It was hands down one of the tastiest and juiciest hamburger I've had. Everyone in our group really enjoyed their meal, so no compaints. The drinks we ordered were tasteful and full of alcohol. I had the michelada royale, so yummy. My husband had something called the godfather 2, that was very very strong, but he liked it. This place is known for their specialty milkshakes so we ordered the cotton candy strawberry milkshake, hands down one of the best milkshakes we've had and I'm speaking for the entire group. To top of our wonderful experience here the service was fantastic. Our server Aaron was energetic, nice, upbeat and just a delight, he checked on us often to make sure we were all doing good, enjoying the food or needed drink refills. This is a place I will definitely return to and I highly recommend. Kudos to Black Tap."}
{"text":"Overrated. The milk shakes are sugar overload. Everything is built for the IG. Unfortunately, the taste of the shakes are just too indulgent that it becomes dull."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant I chose to celebrate my birthday at in Vegas. Pros: large portions of food, alright pricing and amazing shakes. Cons: the tasting of the chicken sandwich I chose. The server I had was a guy who really wanted me to have a good time since it was my birthday. Kinda pushy with the $15 shakes they offer but I kindly decline. The chicken wings are to die for! The burgers (beef), are ginormous!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have visited black tap twice and they are constantly amazing. The food and service is always on point. This last time we ate at the bar with Leo and he made the experience so memorable. If visiting or looking for a great place to eat in Vegas black tap is a must!"}
{"text":"Jonny and Nate were both AMAZING! Knew exactly what to recommend and were so accommodating! Will definitely come back and recommend to everyone. Black Tap is definitely a must try while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Crazy shakes have landed in Vegas! If you're looking for an over-the-top experience, this is the place for you! From the crazy shakes to delicious burgers and  endless instagram back drops to take pictures. I had The Greg Norman burger which includes wagyu beef, house butter milk dill, blue cheese and arugula. All burger patties are cooked to a chef medium so they are still nice and pink. Fries were golden and crispy. The fried pickles  were an app that will have me coming back! But the star of the show was definitely the crazy shakes! You can even go up to the bar and watch as they create your sugar filled treat! The Cookies 'n Cream Supreme was accompanied with a whole ice cream sandwich! The Brooklyn Blackout was accompanied with a whole chocolate brownie and The Cookie Shake included two cookiewiches!   I cannot wait to recommend this place to friends and family. Keep up the amazing quality!"}
{"text":"the burger prices aren't cheap! Even for 'strip prices'....that being said, I have to say that it was probably the best beef I've ever tasted in a burger. I can't say the last time I have a burger that good! It's actually worth the price.  I had the old fashioned and it was damn good.   The shakes are over the top. I skipped trying a beer or cocktail and opted for a shake. The peanut butter one. It was fully loaded (as in my picture) with pretzel sticks, candy, frosting, etc. A fantastic shake but it was more loaded with whipped cream and candy that there was actually very little shake to it. Just as much whipped cream as there is actual shake drink.  Price vs item it wasn't worth it, UNLESS you are going specifically for dessert. If I just wanted a dessert and not a shake, then go for it. It's hand crafted and tastes like it.   Our server was fantastic and fun. The staff was attentive and helping each other fill water (if you have a shake with dinner, you'll drink a lot of water. lol) and clear empty plates.   Had the deep fried dill pickle slices as well..good stuff! The dill dressing on the side for dipping was pretty amazing as well.   The back patio will be the place to be, since it over looks the gondola's and you have a clear view of the volcano erupting across the street!"}
{"text":"Disappointed...not a great dining experience. We waited over half an hour to get our shakes with no warning that they were so backed up till we asked where theh. (Also...if you're consistently backed up because the shakes are so popular, why aren't you hiring more people to make them?) We ordered our food & beverages & were quickly forgotten about. Had to ask the bartender 5 minutes later if we could get our Cokes. The shakes themselves were decent though way over priced for what you get. I understand it's a novelty though. Based on service I probably wouldn't come back.   Update: we were contacted & given a great experience. Great food great service great atmosphere this time. Locals, this is a great reason to come to the strip."}
{"text":"Black tap has the best music in town! I loved hearing the Beastie Boys, \"retro\" Eminem and other old school music while we ate. The atmosphere is hip and there's plenty of cool photo opportunities.   Pros -  The shakes are literally a meal in themselves -- and all I could eat was my Birthday Cake Shake --- complete with a huge slice of cake on top! They're beautiful and absolutely delicious!! My kids ordered fried cheese, chips and some fries in addition to their shakes. They enjoyed their food, and had no complaints.  My oldest daughter had the Cookie Shake and the younger one ordered the Cotton Candy Shake. They LOVED them!!  Cons- They don't take reservations, and personally I think that's unfortunate. It's first come, first serve. Normally, that wouldn't be such a downer --- but the line for Black Tap is directly across from the Sport Book and my eyes were really bugging me from all the cigar and cigarette smoke emanating from the Sports Book area. Another thing I didn't like is the minuscule water glasses you get at your table. Sure, they give you a larger bottle to refill your water with, but the glass is like the size of a large shot glass. Not too practical when in Vegas where it's super dry and hot. In addition, the water was room temperature and there was no ice. Its Vegas - we need cold water.....   Overall, it was a great vibe and delicious food. We will definitely return, but I wish they took reservations!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely what it's worked up to be. We sat at the bar and had a great time with the bartenders! They were fun and quick. The food is on the pricier side but everything is large and in charge here! You definitely won't leave hungry. You could leave like us, slowly, bloated, asking, \"why isn't my stomach bigger, so it can fit more food? ;)\" If we were to do it over again, we would share an appetizer, meal and shake!"}
{"text":"Wow! Outstanding place! Great decor and the most Amazing shake station you can ever see! You get to watch the Master create right before your eyes! Chili Burger is the Bomb! It was too chilly for the patio but I will be back! They have one of The Best patio dining spots on the Strip! Matt and Rachael took care of us at the bar...I LOVE being around people who Love what they do!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers. Super friendly staff. Fresh toppings.  A new burger joint recently opened up on the main level of the venetian casino. And it gets very busy bc of this. The menu has a little bit of everything and im sure picky eaters could find something they like. They dont offer much variety for their sides and this disappointed me.   The bartender highly recommended the broccoli as a side saying it was sooo good. It made my mouth water by his descriptions. Unfortunatly it is nothing worth writing about as its just charred brocolli with some teriyaki sauce. Nothing special or outstanding bout it and frankly it did not pair well at all with the burger. It just kinda was one of the worst suggestions ever and i love brocolli. I hardly finished half.   The burgers were decent. Fresh toppings and very filling. But hardly anything special than a typical burger joint. Our food came relatively quickly so that was a bonus. Although initially our order was given to other people first, but luckily thy never touched it before giving it to us. This error cost them 2 stars. Never ever should my meal be served to someone else than moved to me afterwards. And on top of it. We were not even given an apology or anything. Instead our meals were slided across the bar to us by the bartender as if nothing hapoened. Total utter complete fail."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, I took my 13 year Daughters here for their birthday dinner. The music here is right on point"}
{"text":"My ratings are based on experience and the journey getting there.   I was received by a vibrant, populous, aestheticly pleasing pop-stand. Greetings were pleasant and the music fit the deco*.   As you make your way to your seating, your eyes are greeted with gigantic mouthwatering milkshakes. The size is not the only thing that attracts you but it is the artistic design. It's as if all your favorite sugar treats were eaten by a unicorn and the unicorn threw up rainbows on the milk shake.  On deck:  The cake shake  The cookie shake  No need to describe what is in the milk shake, the name and photo speaks it all, and the taste is also the same. Wish I could speak more about taste but that is why my 5 stars are missing one. There was nothing out of the ordinary. You pay for the plentiful servings and the taste of a sugary milkshake.   The service is on par! Michelle is helpful and all smiles. Thanks for the good service."}
{"text":"Funky, casual atmosphere. Burgers were excellent/high-quality. Our kids loved the milkshakes-definitely a highlight.   Restaurant recently opened so they were still trying to get their legs. Service quite slow, and they were out of the beer and wine we ordered.   Overall, solid place."}
{"text":"Fast service, excellent burgers & sides, and great local brews.  I stopped at Black Tap during peak dinner hours, so I expected a wait. Instead, I was able to get a seat at the bar right away. My server stopped by quickly and offered me a sample of several beers, to ensure I would like what I ultimately ordered. Thanks to the sample, I found a great local lager that was light and easy to drink.  Then it was time to choose a burger. There are at least a dozen unique, all prime beef choices and I was torn so I asked my server what was best. He gave me two great options and I finally made my decision. The classic all-American bacon cheeseburger. It was juicy and delicious. The fries were perfectly golden brown. I was impressed.  Prices are high, but it's a casino restaurant in Vegas, so I expected as much. Three beers and two burgers with sides ran about $80 with tip."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant out, mainly for their milkshakes! I have seen their milkshakes on instagram for a while now and they are huge and look so tasty! We went on a weekend and there was NO wait which is amazing for a strip property restaurant. For our appetizer we ordered the mozzarella sticks... it was the best sticks we've ever had! The mozzarella sticks tasted so fresh and the dip complimented it very well. We ordered for our main meal two chicken sandwiches for about $18 dollars each with two sides of sweet potato fries. The chicken sandwiches were so basic and there was no wow factor. For dessert they had a special going on for Chinese New Year that we got and it tasted so basic too, vanilla ice cream with a sugar cookie and golden chocolate coins. We came for the milkshakes and were very disappointed. Our bill came to over $120 and we left un satisfied and we won't be back. :("}
{"text":"Wow oh wow.... I would like to say it's the worst $30 burger I've had... But it was just the worst, hands down. So we had the fried pickles and fried mozzarella both of which were good. The burger is where things went vastly wrong!! The Buns was completely soaked and soggy on all four of my groups hamburgers. The fries were good and a generous portion as well, but no one wants to eat fries alone as a meal! So as we ALL ate our burgers bun less with knife and fork, we noticed other patrons doing the same. We then asked for a side of ranch and BBQ, which came in tiny, quarter full cups, that we were charged $1 each for. Would have berm nice for the server to mention this. In addition, the menu Says gluten free Buns are a $2 substitution which is fine because one of us has a gluten allergy but they charged us $4. In After this our server never seemed to return to check on us, refill drinks or take our desert order (restaurant weeks prefix menu) I had the Mexico city burger, done medium. The meat itself was fine, flavorless, but fine, but was paired with soggy (like the bun, notice a theme here?) onion rings and pickled japenos that had no spice but still tasted strongly of vinegar, almost as if the pickling process was not finished. A friend had the BBQ bacon with what appeared to be uncooked onion rings, but likely just soggy. After 30 minutes of asking around for our server, we were able to order our shakes.... Black cherry, coffee, cookies and cream....which all tasted like VANILLA, with minimal distinction in color difference. A fourth shake was not ordered because they have no gluten free shakes, a substitute was not offered. As we all began tasting each others confused as to why the black cherry and coffee ice cream looked and tasted the same... Both like vanilla!! And we were so  ready to leave. I realize server's live off tips so we still left 15% but truly I wanted to leave nothing. I will never return and encourage others not to try. Go to the burger bar instead, it's delightful!"}
{"text":"As a local I'd have to agree with everyone else asking what the hype is about this place . The burgers were mediocre at best (if I had to choose the truffle burger was my fav) and the shakes although very appealing to the eye are just a bunch of pre-made ingredients stacked and stuck to large glassware . The Brooklyn Chocolate shake tasted like Hershey's syrup simply mixed with ice cream & they use canned whip cream . For $15 a pop y'all can't make some fresh whipped cream and chocolate ganache ?! This is our second time here & probably won't be back ."}
{"text":"Josh is awesome. If you like beer and good food come check this place out. He WILL take care of you. Josh I'll brb. Cheers brotha! (free app btw, come and ask him about it)"}
{"text":"Shakes to die for!  One of their signature items here, are there amazingly looking shakes. First impressions mean a lot, at Black Tap, they truly make a first impression memorable.   Located inside of the Venetian Hotel, Black Tap has a 80s-90s vibe with some old skool, music playing in the background. The art work takes you back to this wonderful era and nostalgia rushes in like a cloud of smoke.   It wasn't the food I came here for, but for their shakes. If you had one look at these babies, you'd agree and know who the star of the show was. I was fortunate enough to try the Cookie Shake which included my shake, whole cookie pieces and a scoop of ice cream underneath a pillowy cloud of whipped cream, topped with chocolate drizzle. This is my kind of shake.  It looks super good and makes for a great yelp foodie pick, but they're just as great in taste.  It's worth it's weight in gold.   Service starts off with your shake. It's the main attraction anyways lol. You'll definitely enjoy it. On this day, I ordered their Korean wings, which I added some fries to go with that. This came out shortly after my shake. Service was efficient and relaxed. Wish there was more to try, but when I'm back in town and at the Venetian, I'm coming back for more!     Definitely a must do, is check out their shakes. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Its in a spot that is its third burger rendition.  The staff is kind of standoffish at first but they warmed up.    It was across from the poker room and many people came in smoking or to ask questions which was annoying.  The food was good, but not worth the trip if you aren't already stumbling upon it.  Desserts were pretty fun."}
{"text":"Fun vibes with crazy looking shakes. We came here for those two reasons.   Waited about 30 mins to be sat which is understandable because this place is new, popular and on the strip.   Unfortunately we were super unlucky the evening we came because they sat us at a bar top overlooking the casino. There are two reasons they should entirely get rid of this area: you are faced away from the restaurant so it feels like you're not even there to begin with and secondly it's open to the casino and people walking by smoking cigarettes. As a non smoker it's extra disgusting smelling smoke as you're eating.   We asked to be moved and the ladies at the front told us we would have to wait back in line again. Seriously? Luckily another girl came by and told us two seats at the bar opened and we could have them. This helped because we could actually see the place and weren't smelling smoke from the casino any longer.   So we ordered a truffle burger, onion rings and sweet potato fries. Both sides were delicious. As for the burger we specifically said we would like it medium and the waiter said that's what the chef recommended. Unfortunately we received a rare burger that was entirely bright pink in the center. Our waiter looked at it and said he'd be back with it cooked the right way. As another 20 mins passed we had already eaten our sides. Can't say that wasn't annoying. So when the second burger came back it was charred. I wanted to cry.   So we ended up getting a shake because we were still hungry. The playful & huge shake was great.   If you sit inside the restaurant you'll probably have a much better experience and I guess we just got unlucky twice with the overpriced, inedible burger. Keep in mind the burgers here average about $18."}
{"text":"Was coming back down the strip, and made a pitstop into the Venetian for a quick bite to eat. But where should you eat when you're at the Venetian?  Came across black tap and recognized that this was the Burger Mecca that I have been in search of! On the menu are over 20 burgers, some of Las Vegas's best french fries, onion rings and fried pickles, and don't get me started on a 2,000+ calorie milkshake.  But let's go there... Black Tap has some of the best looking milkshakes ever (and I've seen some pretty awesome places with some pretty awesome milkshakes!) They're a bit pricey at almost $20 a shake, so know this much... your burger is going to cost you about $20 and a milkshake will set you back $20, so with tip you're probably looking at $50 per person which isn't inexpensive for a hamburger and a milkshake. But this is no burger shack or Shake Shack for that matter, the burgers are awesome!  Had The au poivre hamburger with some French fries (I'm all in France  , you here me?!?) Also sampled the all American... both out of this world. So if your looking for an awesome burger... Welcome home!  Only DISAPPOINTMENT was the lousy napkins that are in a cheap diner style on table top dispenser. For $20 a burger, you could/should get cloth napkins!!!  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"I must say the atmosphere here was so calming yet fun ...the neon lights and graffiti wall art was my favorite the staff was friendly and the milkshakes we're AMAZING very kid friendly and not a long wait as I had anticipated"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers... made to order and of course you can not forget the delicious shakes..The customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"My mother and I were the first ones in line waiting for this to open at 5pm. We had been stalking Instagram since it was first announced that there would be a location at the Venetian. It certainly lived up to the hype. Best salad I've ever had with such balanced flavors. It was a turkey burger with cranberries, avocado, green apple, bleu cheese, and kale. The staff was so friendly and the shake (Aka: The main event) did not disappoint. The Cookies and Creme Supreme was fabulous and was just like drinking an Oreo but better. We feel so honored to have been part of the opening night and to have been treated so well. Great atmosphere, awesome song selection. Super cool patio I would have eaten on if it wasn't winter."}
{"text":"Food was okay but my husband and I requested to sit outside and we were told it was closed - however as we were leaving they were seating another party outside who requested to sit outside as well.  Was excited to try it but will not be back as we were treated unfairly and not sure why."}
{"text":"Burger just OK, Pickle's are gross and the service the worst.  The shakes are amazing but I wanted a beer/burger and waited 30mins for my beer after I order with no chance to get a second.  They have a small army of employees so I'm not sure why they can't ask if I wanted another round.  The beer was 16oz for $8.00.  Vegas is becoming overrated with high prices and horrible service.  Tap Out of Black Tap and waist your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Soo Black Tap inside the Venetian is probably one of the best places I've been to of it caliber. Great service, friendly atmosphere, only the best music, and to top it off phenomenal food. I've been twice now. From their monstrous shakes, almost perfect poured beers to a perfectly cooked burger. Guacamole you can eat by itself I just can't explain it you just have to go there!!  However, with all its deliciousness be sure to spend money. $15 shakes and $20 burgers, but you only live once and great food should be a must.  Going to NY next month to try the original Black Tap...to be continued..."}
{"text":"I was a little worried given the meh reviews, but Jason put all the concerns aside, by being an amazing server!! Love the 60 minute IPA he recommended, hubby loved it so much he took mine!! Burger was delish, got the old fashioned Yum, the horseradish sauce was such a nice addition. Hubby got the fried chicken with Korean BBQ sauce, wow! It was tangy and spicy, perfect with the sweet potato fries. The Shakes were a complete story in their own, Wow!! The couple next to us got the cake batter shake, I had to ask her if I could take a picture... she said it was better than her dads cupcakes! If you happen to go, request Jason, he was a wonderful server!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.   Lots of staff wondering around.   We had to call waiter over multiple times to ask him where our food was.   As I write this I've been waiting an hour for my food @4pm  with a half empty restaurant.    Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. I'm local so wanted to try out the food. Saw it on our local channel.  Well the service was horrible.  They screwed up our order completely.  Charged us for the wrong sauce for our burger (They brought the correct one. But charged us for their mistake). Charged fir extra dressing on the salad!! The burgers were ok, nothing like the picture on the menu, or what I saw on TV,  that they presented. Honestly not a great burger at all. Had to wait forever for our food. There are so many great burger places in Vegas. But not here. We won't go back or recommend this place to our friends and family who visit."}
{"text":"Ummmmm yum is all I can say.   I ended up here because of the ridiculous milkshakes I saw on their IG and the hotel menu.   One thing I will say is don't go during the busy times or you will stand in the \"club line\". Lol. It's literally a roped line you stand in outside of the restaurant until it's your turn to come in like the club.   The place is small and quaint and has a nice patio area.   The food was really good and fairly priced for the portions. ($80 for an order of onion rings which were phenomenal, a salad, burger, and milkshake) And I love the fact that they serve Wagyu Beef.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because of my milkshake. Even though it was good it did not quite look like all the pics. Which was kind of disappointing.   But it was ok because it was still good, my food was good, and the service was great. So I can overlook the fact that I didn't get an IG pic milkshake.    Try it out though. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"really great experience- even had the special GOLDEN KNIGHT shake ! soooo good.  Will need to comeback for the Cake Shake"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. I got the vegan burger and it was super tasty and the portions were very generous. Then there are the crazy shakes. BEST SHAKE I'VE EVER HAD. The cake shake surpassed all of my expectations. I can't wait until my next trip here :)"}
{"text":"had the confetti cake milkshake it was awesome but the wait to get in took 45 mins on a Monday night"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas this past weekend with an intent to eat my way through the strip, and it was very successful trip. Black Tap was my last destination, and I was very satisfied with my finale choice. We were planning to go for dinner the night before we actually went, and I was planning to have the Brussels sprouts and Korean BBQ wings, but we ended up enjoying pizza at midnight instead. So for lunch I ordered the BBQ burger (I forget what it's called but it has bacon and an onion ring). It was SO good. I'll first say that I have been majority vegetarian/vegan for the past year and this weekend I wanted to not have to limit myself so I enjoyed all the animals with as much gratitude as humanly possible.  My boyfriend got the Truffle Burger, and it was delightfully rich, but not overly so. The fries were cooked perfectly - crispy outside, soft inside - but they weren't really salty enough for my taste (boyfriend liked them). Then of course we HAD to get a shake. The milkshake bar is like what I imagine they have in Heaven's cafeteria. I wanted the Bam Bam because it included a pop-tart, the most perfect snack. It was a feast for the eyes; frosting holding onto a full-coverage sprinkle of fruity pebbles, a high pile of whip cream with more fruit pebbles, all decorated with a stick of laffy taffy, rice crispy treat (more fruity pebbles), and half a strawberry pop-tart. While it was delicious, I have to say it presented better than it tasted. I think I would have preferred if it was ice cream in it's natural state instead of blended because I like to eat everything with a spoon. And the fruity pebbles on the frosting were a little stale, but the ones on the whip cream were fresh, which seemed strange.  This was a really long review... Anyway, I liked Black Tap and will recommend it to my burger-loving friends. And I will be back to try the Brussels and wings! ...And probably the chocolate brownie shake option..."}
{"text":"Had birthday there! Good food and the shakes are outrageous!!! Its a bit more expensive than a local place but there was nothing to complain about at all. We were there midday on a Friday also! Great service!"}
{"text":"It was a decent burger but the cheese was not melted, actually cheese was still cold. Fries were wimpy limpy. Service was as if by ordering food it was a great imposition to the staff. A million better burger places on the strip."}
{"text":"Great burger and service. Had a birthday cake milkshake... It was definitely enough for 2 people and a lot of sugar... But it was so delicious and the pics are great!"}
{"text":"The decor and the ambience are amazing. Instagramers, get ready for some awesome pictures! Different themed rooms, cool and flashy wallpapers, and any of their shakes make the perfect #foodporn picture. The food itself is pretty pricey, but hey, you're on the Vegas Strip, Baby! Still kinda expensive to me for burgers. There are other joints in town offering better quality for less money, definitely."}
{"text":"Living near NYC, I've wanted to try Black Tap but have hesitated due to the wait. Black Tap LV is located in the Venetian and appears to be relatively new with trendy decor.   We tried the burger (which comes with fries), burger salad and veggie burger salad. We all liked our meals. The burgers were good quality and the salad came with a special sauce, which made a good accompaniment for the fries - I recommend asking for a side if you get fries. The salads themselves had too much lettuce but great flavor. The cocktails were too sweet for my liking - both the froze and the mule - but my group enjoyed them. We were too full to get dessert/milkshakes but I'll definitely try them in the future in one of the NYC locations."}
{"text":"Just wanted a great burger and beer after driving 5 hours.  The beer selection was okay - I found one I liked, my hubby was not impressed.  We split a burger and a salad - the salad was WAY better than the burger.  The bun was lame - obviously store bought buns.  The burger was cooked okay - a little over done. The salad was good - if we go back, we both will get a salad."}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night after seeing it open for some time. I have been to a few other burger places around town (Gordon Ramsey, Holsteins, etc.) and this is my new favorite on the Strip. I went with the 'Greg Norman' Wagyu beef burger. It was outstanding! Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The fries were awesome as well. I was happy I didn't get a milkshake as I could barely finish the meal. So damn full!! The only surprise are the prices but it is right on the Strip so it is right on par with other similar restaurants. The best part of the meal was a visit by the manager John! He stopped by to make sure everything was up to standard. He was very personable and takes pride in the restaurant. As usual, it was crazy busy in the restaurant and for me it means a lot when someone take the time to ensure you are pleased with the food, especially at restaurants on the strip. It was a great experience! Next time I come back I will get a milkshake! They look ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"THIS JOINT IS INCREDIBLE! The food is amazing, the staff is wonderful and the shakes....they are absolutely out of this world. This is a MUST if you come to Vegas! We loved it so much New Years Eve we had to come back the next day! The bartenders are quick and let me tell you they know how to pour a drink. Great hospitality, quick service and the food is fantastic. Fun place you don't want to miss. Did I mention the shakes? Best I ever had...."}
{"text":"Came here for the crazy milkshake.  I got the oreo one.  I shared it with my bf. Three shake looked and treated awesome.  Well worth the experience."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing shakes and a brilliant presentation!!!!! The wait staff is so friendly and fun!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing milkshakes hands down! Tasteful and flavorful food. I had the mozzarella, the fried pickles and chips and guacamole which were amazing. Tried the Mexico City and the Truffle burger which both were also amazing. Id suggest eating outside on the balcony, that view is to die for"}
{"text":"Cute place. Food is great. Service is excellent. Not too long of a wait for our party of 2 on a Tuesday night. We came for the crazy shakes, which are really creative, taste fine, and they obviously look amazing. I appreciate that their crazy shakes are lower in price (by $5) than another place on the strip that serves crazy shakes, so this place is a little more accessible for me when I treat my 4 kids to their own shakes. I also appreciate that they don't give you side eye when you come in just for shakes. Definitely a fun spot!"}
{"text":"Amazzzzing!!! Perfect sweets fix, perfect hungover fix, perfect everything. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good .... wen with a party of 9 and we were there for the full experience... however the hostess insisted on not using a pen and pad. She was a little inattentive plates stacked quickly and all the food was brought out at once when salads and appetizers were ordered prior.... the check was given before the chance to ask for dessert .... i liked the beer selection personally but hopefully they will hire more seasoned waiters and waitresses in order to complete the upscale hamburger n shake experience"}
{"text":"10/10 reccomend the chili cheese burger. Satisfied every bit of my cravings. The cotton candy shake too was perfecto. Had a great time with family and an excellent server to start until he had to switch and someone else took over. Besides the menu being pricey (which is normal for eating just about ANYWHERE on the strip) and the sauces costing an extra dollar each I overall had a great experience from meal to atmosphere. Came on a Thursday evening around 5:00. Very friendly staff and had a booth ready when we came in. Would love to come back again soon."}
{"text":"I went here last week for my birthday with my daughter and brother . The server was really sweet and attentive she was young with glasses . Anyways I ordered some drink with ginger in it , something mule ? It was horrible and really overpowering . I returned the drink and the waitress was really understanding and took it back . Little did the bartender know I was a table right next to the bar. I heard her complaining about this was her second drink sent back , saying duhhh it comes with that, tasting the drink with a straw and being a little insensitive , but that's okay , I understand everyone has bad days . She did seem to be more interested with the buss boys who she was all touchy with , which was a little awkward for me to watch next to my 3 year old daughter . Fast forward to the burgers , I ordered the truffle burger and I thought it was super good , a little pricey for what I received but I can't complain , I did enjoy it . Now to the shakes , I got the cake batter one which was absolutely amazing! My brother got the chocolate shake and I have to say, that was the best part of the meal and I have no problem paying $15 dollars  per shake. the restaurant it's self was clean and had a cool ambiance."}
{"text":"My experience at Black Tap was not good. We waited an 1 hour to be seated. After we were seated we gave our drink order which were a couple Strawberry Lemonades and a couple alcoholic beverages. NOT ONE of our drinks was good it worth keeping. They all tasted like water with a splash of whatever it was supposed to be. The lemonades were not sweet at all and the alcohol tasted like liquor and water. After the drinks the food was just mediocre, I had the pizza burger and I can honestly say I've had better burger patties at fast food places especially for a burger to be $15 I'd rather have gone and gotten a $5 burger. Also we went for a birthday and the birthday girl couldn't receive a milkshake because they ran out of supplies. Our meal was so disappointing we asked to speak to the manager and he was aggressive and not really concerned about our bad experience."}
{"text":"We were in NYC a few months ago and the service was WAY better. I mean we came in at 11:15pm on Thursday ( they close at 12) but it did not feel like the service we got in New York, seemed like we were a bother because we came close to closing. It's kinda sad because we were really looking forward to a great experience since we are staying at the Venetian and it's expensive and our experience in New York was amazing. The girl was okay not super friendly but okay. If you are opening a restaurant from a different city maybe make sure everyone you hire is extra awesome to make your restaurant a great impression."}
{"text":"Black Tap comes west.   The shakes are obviously amazing. The flavor and style of the crazy shakes are really something to see.   The burgers are top notch and extremely filling.   Personally I like this location better than the NYC one just bc it has more lighting. It's hard to see in the NYC location.   Very clean as well which I appreciate.   I also think that it's a little expensive for what it is. I wish it was about 2/3 of the price."}
{"text":"SUCH a good burger. Omgggg. So filling too. I had the old fashioned, my group had the Mexico City and the chili one. They also loved theirs. Shakes were so gorgeous and definitely Instagram worthy. Tasty as well! Notched down a star because we were at lunch service and they already ran out of ingredients for the sour shake."}
{"text":"Well, it was pretty good.  A good meal after so much alcohol in Vegas!  Me n my husband are vegetarians - so we're always looknig for veggie options before we go in to a restaurant.  The black bean burger - was too mushy - not great! The sweet potato fries were good!!  My falafel burger was yummmy! I overate like a pig!!  Venetian has better Restaurants - dont try this one if you're in Vegas for the first or second or third time even!"}
{"text":"I got  the old fashion burger with the sweet potato fries. It was cooked perfectly!! My husband got the California turkey burger, also very good , but honestly this place is a beef burger joint. We shared the cookies n cream milkshake, has to be seen to be believed. Our bartender Johanna ( the one with the cool tattoos) was fantastic. Super friendly and provided great service. We went back twice!"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas local I like to try as many restaurants as possible so I know where to recommend. Well, Black Tap, has earned a spot near the top of my list of recommendations! The Truffle and the Old Fashioned Craft Burgers are are two of the best burgers I have ever had!! (seriously, that good!) I'd also give a quick thumbs up to the craft beer selection. The service and management are both an A+! Unfortunately I cannot remember my servers name from my last visit, but I recall my meeting with the manager John. It's rare you meet a restaurant manager that will take time to stop and talk to you and genuinely show interest in what you are saying. I'll definitely be stopping in here after work on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Came for the shakes. They were great! A little slow but worth the wait. Staff was very friendly.   Pro-Tip: skip the line, bar is seat yourself"}
{"text":"Had such a good time at Black Tap with my girlfriends. We were seated outside which had an amazing view of the Las Vegas strip over looking the Gondola canal. Nathan was awesome. Came over to our table to greet us upon arrival and sent drinks to the table. We tried their specialty Mule, highly recommended. Also recommend the fried pickles and Texan burger. Service was excellent. Very attentive. We were able to try every milkshake on the menu. WOW! The presentation and detail of these desserts are unexplainable, not to mention super yummy! We had a great time. Black Tap did not disappoint. Will definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went to tonight's Vegas Uncorked hosted by Bob Appetite what a blast ! Last summer while in NYC i went to Black Tap . Loved it great food and service . So when my bestie saw there was a event while we would be in Vegas i was excited . Wow is all i can say. Just left the event and i partied great food great music and great drinks ! We will be back next year !!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal! Fried mozz was amazing. Our server Jason M was awesome, very friendly and personable. Overall the experience was great. Ski tables and view were great. Def sit outside!"}
{"text":"Best place to get your milk shake!  Environment: it's a pretty casual place, the designs were pretty artistic. My waitress was super friendly, she gives lots of good advices.  Appetizer: I order the onion ring since I'm a big fan of it. It taste alright by itself, and it taste awesome with the sauce.  Milkshake:  This is the main reason why I'm visiting. Since they opened at NYE, and I saw it on Facebook with those crazy fancy pics of milkshake, I decided to come and order a cotton candy milk shake. Instead of original combination of strawberry milkshake, I replaced it with vanilla milkshake, it taste so good!!!!!!!  The cotton candy on top was pretty soft, it melts fast on your months, the color balls surround the cup were chocolate balls. Further more, they had lollipops inside, sugar heaven!  Overall: Awesome milkshake! Friendly Service!"}
{"text":"We Decided to take my kids here for family Sunday just to try out they're famous shakes we have been seeing and hearing about. There we're six of us my husband and 4 kids and we decided to order 5 of the shakes. Our server was great she was friendly and attentive. No complain really about the shakes or the service, even though its $15 per shake which I think was overprice but heck its on the strip so I guess that is some what normal. Would we be back to try them again probably not. Its too overprice,you can get a somewhat similar shake at red robin for way cheaper. My problem was one even though we ordered just 5 shakes but since there was 4 kids with us they charged us an 18% service charge right away, If we ordered a full lunch entrees and all I guess I can understand but for 5 shakes i think its a little too much. Second was me and my husband split the bill which I clearly have the receipt for it, but for some reason they decided to charge my card full price even though I only signed $20 on mine the rest was on my husbands card. I tried calling the first time managers were all on in a meeting didn't get a call back,second day I called still managers were on a meeting again and asked for my number again! finally after seeing that the whole bill cleared my account and not pending I called again, they tried to give me the same excuse that the managers were in a meeting but I didn't budge I said I need to talk to one now, 2 minutes later finally a MANAGER! He told me he will look into it so hopefully they get back to me asap. Just be careful and make sure that you pay attention to the charges and keep the receipt. The shakes are big and I think its a little bit over whelming for one person, so its definitely shareable specially for the price. I ordered one each for my teenagers and they didn't even finish it because they got so overwhelmed with how much chocolate it has.I guess ill update this review once I get a reply from the manager hopefully they get my charges on my card fixed."}
{"text":"This place had some of the biggest shakes I have ever seen! It's almost like attempting to eat an entire meal in just that! They're known for their burgers which was delicious I wound up eating the Texan burger and I loved every bite! The service was decent slower than other places I've been to. But service was still polite and nice."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We came in for my sister's birthday, looking forward to these amazing-looking milkshakes. The presentation was indeed great; we loved the rock candy and cotton candy much more than the shake itself. The shake we got, the \"Cotton Candy\" shake, was a strawberry milkshake with the weakest hint of strawberry I've ever tasted. It took effort to actually find the flavor. Realistically, I could have gotten a better quality (and larger) shake at Del Taco or Jack in the Box.  What especially irritated us was the pricing. In each description, you see you can add a supplement for $2. Expecting to pay $15 for each shake, we received the bill with $17 for each. It turns out, the awesome toppings that you see on the top of the shake aren't included in the base price; they charge $2 more. We wish we had known considering the waitress did nothing to inform us about this and the menu was stunningly vague about what a supplement is. (Seriously, who the hell calls a lollipop or a slice of cake a \"supplement?\")   I'm easily impressed by desserts and sweets, and for the $17 price, this shake might have been one of the most watered-down, worst shakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've finally made it to Black Tap! I've waited for hours outside the Black Tap locations in NYC numerous times, and never actually made it inside. Imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon Black Tap inside The Venetian with no line at all! I was stuffed from my breakfast at Milk Bar, but I couldn't give up this chance for a milkshake!   I have one word: overrated. Also: disappointed.  Not worth the hype!   I ordered the Brooklyn Blackout milkshake with the cake batter milkshake Base. First of all, these milkshakes are much smaller than they look on Yelp or Instagram - they are the size of a standard milkshake, but heavy on top. Secondly, the brownies on the shake tasted like grocery store brownies. And my cake batter Base just tasted like vanilla milk.   Glad I finally got to try Black Tap, but won't be making plans to come back."}
{"text":"I had the old fashion burger, others in our party has the Texan burger and the chili burger. All three were very good. Sweet potatoe frys were very tasty. My spouse chose the black cherry shake. The flavor was incredible. Then there are their insane shakes. If you are looking for a good burger and a great shake give the black tap a try. Service was great too."}
{"text":"OMG. Ok so I ordered the Cobb salad, and it was amazing !!!!!!! Like idk but it felt like the freshest, zestiest, crunchiest thing ever haha. I added chicken strips and it was amazing. The only thing was, the water lol it tasted kinda strange  but overall, food was amazing"}
{"text":"Like many things in Las Vegas this place gives the name craft a bad name. I had the American burger with sweet potato fries, The burger fell short of mediocre and when I asked for a side of mayo I got it and later found out that it was a dollar extra. On the upside the sweet potato fries were pretty good. I definitely will never go back."}
{"text":"The fried picks are SO GOOD.  The atmosphere was cool, the burgers were good but it is over priced in my opinion.  $70 for a burger, a salad, pickles and 2 lemonades."}
{"text":"This adventure started with a 2mi walk to dinner and about 15 minutes of wandering after dinner for dessert. So, if you find this place, hidden amongst the gaming areas of the Venetian, ask for Viv! She was STELLAR!! Super sweet and perfectly attentive. I was a single guest among a bar of men visiting for a Gun Show or the World of Concrete expo. Viv made me feel comfortable and kept a close eye.  I visited because of a post I saw on Instagram about the Crazy Milkshakes. Could not have been happier! Viv suggested the Blackout before pointing out the secondary favorites, all of which I was debating. She pinpointed exactly the ones I was back and forth on. So, since great minds think alike, I took her advice for the blackout milkshake. Always listen to Viv! She told me that the brownies were the best she'd ever had and knowing how most brownie sundaes go, I didn't expect much. Totally shocked! Sweet but not over powering. Rich but well paired with a traditional chocolate shake.  After seeing me attack this thing alone, three guys at the end of the bar, tested fate. Let's just say, they couldn't hold their own to a kiddie cup! Each one hardly finished half. They ordered the cookie version, birthday cake and Oreo. Not a trophy they'll hold anytime soon! If you're craving something sweet, it's a must. The food looked great too but I was on a mission. Try this place, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We just made it here 15 minutes before closing on a Monday night and fulfilled our craving for   * Sweet Potato Fries ($8) - 3.5 stars Got the buttermilk dill which was totally wrong for me, but they replaced it with chipotle mayo for no extra charge. Love how thick these were, and the serving was huge. Slightly on the dry side.  * Classic Shake, Oreo cookies & cream ($9) - 4 stars Thick & tasty. My boyfriend had meant to order the Crazyshake but just said something like \"oreo shake\" - our server did ask to clarify, so it was basically our bad. He still enjoyed this!"}
{"text":"As a local there are tons of better spots off the strip. We wanted to try this place based on the hype and the huge milkshakes. The milkshake is decent, but about the same quality as sonic and way over rated. The food was pretty terrible. We got burgers, very salted and over cooked patty. It was very tall and greasy. The grease soaked through the bun really quickly and it was inedible. Fell apart in my hand. I'd say skip this place. It isn't worth your time, even the bar has a huge menu in front of the tv. Why have a tv if you can't see it? The only thing I can say is that the early 90s music is probably the best part."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. I love the old school hip-hop themed interior. There was a line out the door. Even though it was incredibly busy, the service was very quick, friendly, and attentive! Our burgers were perfectly cooked and delicious. The fries were nothing special. We ordered the Brooklyn Blackout shake to share. Even though it tasted amazing, we weren't able to finish it since it was pretty big. The music is pretty loud, but it's not a major turn off to me (even though it was hard to hear my boyfriend at times). I also ordered the strawberry lemonade, and it tasted very \"off\". Despite that, I would come back."}
{"text":"Awesome Food! Classic Burger, Fries, Fried Pickles , Onion Rings so delicious! Can't forget about the milkshake The Cookie Shake so yummy must have! Kinda upset that I wasn't able to sit at the patio but food made up for it lol..."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. The prices are ridiculous, but that's what you can expect for the Las Vegas Strip. The burgers are very messy, but totally worth it. The Crazyshakes are HUGE and are shareable. They also have classic milkshakes that are just as good as the Crazyshakes without all of the embellishments."}
{"text":"My wife has been following this place for quite some time and she called tonite to make a reservation and we were told that we don't need a reservation! So we got ready and headed down only to find that they have the place booked for a private party! Not cool"}
{"text":"If you're into Hip-Hop music and good food, this is your place. I ordered the truffle burger with a side of fries and enjoyed the meal. The pickles tasted more like cucumbers (not complaining there, I actually prefer cucumbers on my burgers); however, the people at my table didn't get the correct burgers ordered. I ordered mine well (as I do with all of my hamburgers; steaks are a different story), but ended up with medium rare/medium. Still tasty. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Got the truffle burger and it was cooked just right. The sauce wasn't my favorite, but when you're trying to be adventurous in your food choices it was a good shake up from the normal \"cheeseburger\". Fried pickles were a must have, and a must have again. Our waiter/bartender was very professional and funny. It felt more like talking to a friend than a waiter which is hard to find."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Black Tap Las Vegas inside the Venetian today.  To say everything was amazing would be an understatement!  It was great from beginning to end.  The hostess was very welcoming, and she seated us on the patio which had a great view of the gondola rides and the Las Vegas Strip.  There were a few of us dining together so we ordered several items on the menu from appetizers to entrees and ended with their crazy milkshakes.  The food was mouth watering and full of flavor.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions on what to order.  This place is a must try for locals and tourists alike.  It was not just a meal, it was a dining experience which is what going out to eat should be.  Black Tap is also perfect for corporate events and venue buyouts or for any social occasion.  Ask for the special events manager, Jose Saenz!"}
{"text":"Black Tap was a good tourist restaurant.  I liked the look of the venue, pictures, and art work in this location. The ice cream milkshakes was what brought me and my family here. It was a nice place to eat. The music was incredible. It was like I had my own iPhone plugged up to the speakers. Next time I go I want to buy one of the shirts and try a different milkshake. Unfortunately I would only go back for the milkshakes. In my opinion the size of their burgers was just not worth it in the price.  I feel as if I'm going to pay $15-$20 for a burger and fries I want the patty on the buns to be bigger. But overall I would rate Black Tap 4 out of 5 stars. The music and milkshakes were great"}
{"text":"After seeing a ton of ads for Black Tap- I knew I wanted to try it out.  Hidden gem- located in The Venetian, known for its Burgers & insane shakes, so we were pretty excited to try it out.  As we arrived we were greeted by a not so motivated hostess, but impressed by the inside of the hip location with awesome music and cool servers. After waiting a couple minutes in line for a table - we were seated in Dominics section, who immediately greeted us. He brought us a water bottle which was served with mason jars, pretty neat idea. He then went over the menu with us and pointed out some of his favorites. He totally got me on the Wagyu Burger Salad. Also he was very accommodating- I'm not a big fan of arugula, so he made the suggestion to mix the salad with 50 arugula and 50 kale. Let me tell you, that guy knows what you are looking for and knows what his restaurant serves, very knowledgeable. Great service!!  Bussers were also on point. Never had a messy table.  The shakes are pretty epic, but to be honest- too much for one person. We were 3 girls and we could've easily shared a shake.  Overall great experience! Only negative star goes out to the not so welcoming front of the restaurant!  But- we will be returning! Tip: if you have an option to sit outside- do it! Most amazing views of the canal and the strip!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend that lives in Vegas and  OMG they are so good. We started with the friend pickles and again delicious. This is one of the only places that knows how to cook them. All the other plcaes I have gone to have such oily pickles but this place did not. It was just the right amount of salt as well. High recommend the pickles if you like pickles. So we got two different burgers and the one that I had was the steak au (insert rest of name here lol) and that ws to die for. The burger was cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce on the side was wonderful addition to the burger and wow just sitting here my mouth is watering. My friends got the truffle burger and although I didnt taste it my friends said it was amazing as well. So on to dessert we ordered the cookie milk shake and I am usually not such a big fan of sweets but I love it. Highly recommend to come here on your next trip"}
{"text":"Many mixed reviews here. Our experience was very good. Bailey was our server and her customer service was excellent. Our burgers and sweet potato fries also very good. The fancy shake which is not really my thing but it's the experience. Everyone else enjoyed theirs. We will return."}
{"text":"Get the Truffle Burger. No regrets. The flavor is incredible.  Also, the shakes are to die for - Cake Shake and Cookie Shakes were our picks. The Cake Shake is the best!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. So I recommend coming hungry the  food is delicious and the shakes are a must! So for that reason come hungry! The service is also amazing. Our waiter was Michael and he filled us in on all the secrets. Yes they have a secret menu! With the burgers you can switch any of the meats, or any side for 2 which the sides are anywhere from 5-9 dollars but when you add them to you burger you add them for only 2 bucks. I had the crispy chicken Caesar salad it was really really good. The letters is so smooth and the chicken is bomb. Also got the Texan burger and it was also very delicious. The burgers are big enough to share if you like sharing. Lastly the Shake i got the cake Shake because Michael recommended it and the cake is shipped fresh from New York every day  and it did not disappoint! The service was magnificent and I think everyone should try this place out."}
{"text":"The service here blew my mind! Not to mention all of the amazing neon lights, decor, and outdoor view. I got the truffle burger which was literally the best burger I've ever tasted. But those milkshakessssss though! They were so mouth watering. I can't wait to come in again. Thank you Nate!!! My belly looks forward to seeing you again"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but it fell short. It's a new burger restaurant in Vegas so maybe they need to work out the kinks. Took over 10 minutes to get a Diet Coke. Waitress said she has to wait on the bartender to get it. Took a while to get our food and it came out wrong as we asked for the bun on the side. When they finally brought it back it was over cooked. We weren't going to send it back again. Burger was over cooked and bland. The Cobb salad was pretty much just a big bowl of lettuce. Can't recommend this place but gave it 2 stars for location. Best burger in Vegas is still Holsteins."}
{"text":"Talk about the place to go for a great shake especially if you are a foodie who likes to post the best and most epic pics this is your place. From food to shakes super yummy."}
{"text":"For a place that calls itself a craft burger place, the burgers were a disappointment.  I ordered a wagyu burger salad and was told that they were out of wagyu... still paid the same price, though.  Three of us had burgers and we all ordered medium rare - all 3 burgers were bland hockey pucks without the slightest hint of pink to them.    Good thing we came for the crazy shakes!  I loved mine, but we did order a 2nd one and it never arrived, but by that point the person who ordered it didn't want it anymore, so all's well that ends well - but it's definitely a ball that got dropped.  I don't want to fault our server; he was very lovely.  The shake was fun, but note if you want them boozed, you have to get the liquor on the side.  (Holstein's doesn't seem to have this problem w/ their bamboozled shakes.)    So the shakes are good, but as far as burgers go, they fell far short of the mark."}
{"text":"The truffle burger was pretty good, not really worth the price, but it's still a decent burger! As far as the shake, I don't think there's anything special about the taste, but it was such a masterpiece in itself. I had the sour shake and the bam bam shake. Both had wonderful presentation and plenty of toppings. Will definitely come back to try some more!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch during a conference, and had the Mexico City burger.  I ordered it because I love pickled jalapeños, and it was a great burger!!  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the milkshakes looked awesome, they have a whole milkshake station in the middle of the place, pretty amazing."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick beer and late-night snack, which they cheerfully provided. Even the sweet potato fries were good--and I don't even like sweet potato fries. The milkshakes were a little too intimidating for our state of mind at the time, but I would like to go back and try that some day. Don't know if I could avoid going all Vincent Vega on the price, but they did look good."}
{"text":"Location was the only difficult part.  It is located on the casino floor across from the sports book, not in Grand Canal or Restaurant Row like I was imagining.  Went just for the Crazy Shakes. $15 of amazing sugary goodness.  They are so popular, there is a dedicated location that is used to make them. Best part?  You can watch the action happen!  Shakes are NOT made in the kitchen, they are made where you can see them.  Each one is hand crafted carefully, and seems \"with love.\"  They do top it with a LOT of whipped cream, and that is what filled us up faster, then when we got to the shake portion, we were struggling.  The quality and presentation are superior to anything I have ever seen.  Each has their own unique flare.  For example, Sweet and Salty has pretzel sticks, Cookies and Creme Supreme has a cookie sandwich, and the Birthday Cake has a literal birthday cake wedge on top.  Excellent place!  Will have to come for the food to try next time, and of course to indulge in another Crazy Shak  My suggestion for Management if this is reviewed: slightly larger diameter straws.  The ones they use are simple soda straws, and I'm assuming most of the shakes have particles in them that gets stuck in the straw.  For example I had the Cookies and Creme Supreme with a cookies and cream based shake, and found the straw to be unusable.  SECOND VISIT 3/24/2018:  came for another round.  This time, had a turkey burger salad prior.  Salad was incredibly fresh, very large portion, and flavorful.  CrazyShake chosen was a Brooklyn Blackout.  Just like the first experience, this shake had a delicate display but was bursting with incredible flavor.  The key to this visit was our waitress Bailey.  She was incredibly fun-spirited, took care of our table very nicely, and communicated with us whenever possible.  It is people like Bailey that help make experiences worth the while in Las Vegas.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent!! 5 star Service, Burgers, Fries and awesome SHAKES!!!! Thee best prime burger  I have ever eaten!! Bailey provided excellent service and was super helpful and cool to talk to!! I just went to Bavettes steakhouse and this burger crushed it!! Dont miss this place when in Las Vegas or NYC!!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit Black Tap over the weekend while visiting a friend in Vegas. The food was absolutely delicious. We split the Texan Burger and wings... soooo good! Our waiter Buddy was so attentive and polite. Awesome experience. I will absolutely be back for their famous milkshakes... I was too full to indulge!"}
{"text":"Here for a conference and had dinner.  Plus: excellent selection of burgers and pub food. The other diners in my group were very happy. On the gluten-free side, the server went to check with the chef for what could be done for me, which I appreciated. Follow up was timely.  Minus: when the burger came out, it came out with french fries on the plate, not from a dedicated fryer. I should've sent it back, but I figured I would just give it a try and move the french fries away from the Burger. As anyone with celiac disease knows, that is a no-no, and I ended up getting a dosed as a result."}
{"text":"F'in delicious food.  Burger was definitely one of the best I've had.  Great char on the meat -- perfect flavor.  Also don't miss out on the Fried Chicken Sandwich either.  Honestly that was probably one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had also."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers with the idea of each of us ordering a different shake and sharing so we could all have a taste. Even at 4pm on a Friday there was already a line and the place was crowded and loud. We put in our orders and only had to wait a bit for the shakes to come out. I am still confused as to why we were served room temperature water. It was gross. We shared the shakes and each had our favorite. What a sticky mess was made. They should offer wet wipes. Our waitress was not very friendly or helpful. I sat near the prep area for the shakes and as you can see from my picture, it was very dirty. I know they were busy, but a kitchen/work area should be clean. We ordered some appetizers to share, but they were not worth mentioning.  I'd say pay Black Tap a visit if you have family or friends in town or if you are feeling glutenous."}
{"text":"Right on the outter parts of the Venetian, this is very comparable to Holsteins inside the Cosmo. This place has good burgers and fries, and of course milk shakes. The waitress recommended we split a burger if we each planned on getting our own shake, good call!! Shouldn't have gotten the chips and queso, it was just so so but we were too hungry. We ended up getting the Greg Norman, wagyu beef, blue cheese and arugula. It comes w fries and runs about $20. Milk shakes are why people come here, to get a pic for the instabook and snapface. They run about $15 but are like 3 desserts in one, guess the difference between this and Holsteins is that these don't come w alcohol. These shakes are better in my opinion!!! We ended up w the cookie one and the birthday cake one. I really liked both, we couldn't finish both though!! Burger places on the strip will get you though. This meal will run you $75!!!! Not value town, but in line with other Vegas places on the strip. Worth a visit for sure. I'll be back one day."}
{"text":"Really good beer . Friendly servers and the falafel burger hit the spot. Nice music as well"}
{"text":"The appetizers are wonderful and we were 6 people and we shared 3 deserts.  It was a little expensive but a great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"they close at 2 . got there at 1 and they told me that they were closed. they closed early because \"it was slow\". wtf does that have to do with me?! this america or am I in a their world? I drove far and walked all the way through this big ass hotel to be sent to grand luxe . I wanted a MILK SHAKE GAT DAMMIT!"}
{"text":"Line to get in at 1pm on a Monday was about 20 people long but moved fast, only took 10 minutes or so. Sat at the bar and were given tiny mason jars to drink water out of- silly. The menu looked great but prices were unexpectedly high ($17 for a hamburger). We don't eat dairy so the crazy shakes were fun to see but no dessert options other than shakes. We got chips/guac (skip it- $12 and tiny portions) a chicken sandwich w/ sweet potato fries (large portions) and house salad (tasty but small). The salad came out about 20 minutes after the rest of our food, only after I asked where my salad was. The waitress didn't put it in when placing our order. The food was good but it was just overpriced, wasn't worth the hassle. $50 for lunch for 2..And we didn't even order 2 full entrees. Bartenders are busy, understandably, so get a table so you have more attentive service."}
{"text":"I wanted to go for quite some time in New York but didn't want to wait two hours for a table. In Vegas for a conference and finding they opened in Venetian Palazzo was too good to be true. I would finally try it! Well, I could have lived without it. We shared a shake and order of fries. No wait. Sat at the counter. The shake was one of the over the top ones, Oreo. Shake itself was big but nothing special. Tons of whipped cream and sugary crap on top, far less actual shake than you would expect. Cookie caked all around the rim that you can't even eat. Not impressed and made me feel sick. Waste of calories. Fries were so so. People next to us had burgers and I saw no reason to try one. Only giving two stars because the service was attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Please tell me why it took me a good while to find this restaurant?  When I finally did, my sister and I were seated right by the entrance. I assume it was just incredibly busy.   We ordered the Cookies n Cream Supreme, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Falafel Burger.  The only problem I had was that the crazy shake came out before the food, so I was almost full by the time I got my burger.  I was taken aback because I assumed the shake would be pretty sweet. Hmm... it was like a thick, creamy vanilla milkshake with chunks of Oreos at the bottom. The glass rim is dipped in chunks of Oreos and a round ice cream sandwich lay on top of the whip cream decoration which was not very sweet either.  The portions are huge! The side of fries can fill you up already before you even take a bite out of your burger. The chicken sandwich seemed like a good old chicken sandwich. There was nothing korean about it. Nonetheless, my sister said it was incredibly delicious. Now, the falafel burger was quite unique. The sauce that came along with it made the burger tangy and sort of bitter. Overall, I'm glad we checked this place out. The servers were all around nice and fast. Our food came out pretty quick, and I think I'll come back for another crazy shake."}
{"text":"Ambiance - 4 stars  Service -3 stars  Food - 2.7-3ish    We were a large party of 12 first told we couldn't sit together . Only to come outside and see a larger party of 18 all together. Our server wasn't nice or rude . For this place to have so much advertising online you would expect alittle more personality or something . But any way after being seated we had Luke warm tap water in a small mason jar with no ice ..  I ordered a Strawberry lemonade that was sent back because it was so watery and flavorless .  Brussel Sprouts for an appetizer which were great . My chicken Sandwich was great . The birthday girl Wanted the cake milkshake but they ran out of cake . So we just called for checks . Instead of our server telling us in the beginning checks could not be split he waited until we asked after dinner had been completed . So the manager comes Out WITH ATTITUDE and allows us to have a 4 way split .  I wouldn't recommend this place to a burger lover because the food isn't worth the money and the venue has more personality than the staff"}
{"text":"At LV, we went there last a few weeks ago.. ordered Oero Shake n hamburger without bread. Hamburger w salad. I shared it w my wife. I love it."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 6pm.  There was a line to get a table but the bar is first come, first serve, so we sat down immediately.  The burgers were huge and the service was pretty quick!  We did not get any shakes but they look amazing!"}
{"text":"Their truffle burger was the bomb! One of the best burgers I've ever had. The truffle flavor was just the right amount. We got it with onion rings which for me was just way too big. The salad was okay at first but as you eat more, it just tasted too sour for our taste. Their milkshakes are so instagrammable but flavor wise, I don't think it was special. Would love to eat here again."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic and earned the fifth star. My only advice I would give them is to move the TV in the bar. It's completely obstructed by an overhang so you can't actually watch anything which I found oddly overlooked."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out simply based on the photos of the most epic milkshakes I've ever seen. We were seated promptly. The decor is kitschy, and not really to my taste, but that wasn't going to deter me from my mission.   They have quite a selection of craft beers on draft and bottle.  Most of the food items on the menu are burgers, but they have burger salads and some chicken options as well. I understand that it's Vegas and things tend to be pricey here, but most of the burgers were in the upper teens to low 20s range, and the cost for six chicken wings was $14. Six!  When the food came out, it was made to custom specifications as ordered. My husband got the chili burger with no cheese, and I got the Wagyu burger salad and chicken wings. The wings tasted fresh, and the sauce tasted like a spicy teriyaki sauce mixed with BBQ sauce. Still, I don't think it was $14 worth! My husband said that his chili burger was good, no complaints. My Wagyu burger salad was essentially a good-sized burger patty on top of a huge amount of arugula, with some tomatoes, cheese, and pine nuts, but the dressing was super salty.  Finally, the time came for milkshakes. My husband ordered the Cake Batter Shake, while I got the Cotton Candy Shake. They were just as epic as the pictures make it look. You know it's good when people at the neighboring tables lean over to take pictures of your food! The milkshakes were thick and tasty, topped with a generous amount of real whipped cream. The glass itself was coated in frosting and had candies stuck to the outside of it. In my husband's case, the garnish was an entire slice of Funfetti layer cake! My garnishes were an entire lollipop, two sticks of rock sugar, and puffs of cotton candy. The cost of these two milkshake masterpieces? $17 apiece! Yikes.  To summarize, this restaurant is a burger and shake place at heart, that seems to have realized that making the food look amazing draws new customers in, who are willing to fork over an unreasonable amount of money for a milkshake. We experienced very good service while we were there, and the food was decent. Minus one star for salty food, being way overpriced, and weird decor/ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of the most amazing burger places I've ever been too! The moment I came into this restaurant I was greeted with great service from the host. Love the way the restaurant decor is; very cultural great ambiance. I'm a very simple traditional girl when it comes to burgers so I went with the \"All American Burger\" cooked to medium temperature, it was amazingly delicious! Got their simple milkshake and it was bomb.com! I would most definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The burgers are not something I would come back for, the truffle burger was pretty good though but other than that there wasn't anything special about this place, onion rings were bland as well. I guess it's one of those restaurants that has a nice environment for a casual hangout with friends and take nice instagram photos of their shakes. I would recommend this place to go at least once but honestly liked Holstein's at Cosmopolitan better which is very similar to this place."}
{"text":"Can we just say food heaven? The burger was juicy and delicious and my shake changed my life. The service was also stellar as well. It's located in the Venetian and pretty damn awesome."}
{"text":"Brand new spot way in the back of the Venetian. As for food, I would probably go 3.5 stars, but service was great and friendly, great beer list, and the vibe of the place is pretty cool.   Black Tap is known for its burgers, crazy shakes, and 90s hip hop environment. We cannot comment on the crazy shakes, though they look amazing! We shared some fried pickles, which were good, but the oil they fried them in could have been hotter. Enjoyed a side of queso, which was also good. Eat it before it gets cold!!   We also shared the Chili Cheeseburger, which was decent. Aimee, our great bartender/server, told us that their 'medium' doneness is a bit under medium, which is fine for us but it's really good that they tell people that. A friend of ours who works at another spot says he thinks they over grind their meat, making the burger a bit mushy. I totally see what he's saying. Maybe it's opening kinks the need to work on, maybe not.   I'd definitely stop in again and sit at the bar. Check it out!"}
{"text":"great service, and great burger. I asked the bartender for a shake recommendation, and he said I had to get the cake shake. so I did, and it killed me-- it is literally a slice of cake on a cake batter flavored shake-- and now I'm a ghost."}
{"text":"On our 1st visit, what I noticed 1st was SUPERB service. The staff was patient & attentive to our every need!  The food (Norman burger & fries) were served hot & were DELICIOUS.  Simply put, the shakes are #TODIEFOR!!! The manager, John,  came to our table & introduced himself , inquired about our visit, & even wished our daughter a happy birthday . Several staff, including the manager, thanked us for coming! I knew that the place was busy so i expected the great food that i had-but I was shocked to recieve IMPECCABLE SERVICE on a friday night in Vegas. Thanks BLACKTAP ! Even my 17 year old (who is impressed by no one and nothing) was IMPRESSED & asked to go back!!  #GoodVibes"}
{"text":"Over priced for quality a gimmicky over priced strip restaurant. For a couple of quarter pound burger a water. Decent 80s -90s music tho. Wahlburgers is better."}
{"text":"Lunch at Black Tap was good.  Not great.  Service attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Korean Crispy Chicken Sandwich with onion rings.  Sandwich ok but not much of Korean flair to it.  The onion rings were crispy light and yummy.  So the real reason we went was the crazy shakes. We ordered the Brooklyn Blackout Shake.  It took 20 min to be delivered to the table.  Way too long and it was melting all over the place.  I think it would have been better as a sundae.  Would we go back?  Probably not n"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMM.  I have a massive sweet tooth and the milkshake was for sure satisfying. I also consider myself a fry fan so I had to try them as well. SO good as well.   Shakes are HUGE so I recommend sharing with someone even though you would probably want all of them.   Only complaint was it was a little pricy and the server was slightly snotty but oh well, it was busy"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Saturday and they were definitely busy, but we didn't have to wait as we chose to sit at the bar. The staff was friendly and the food was okay nothing memorable (Truffle Burger & Texan Burger) but I think what makes this place good is their shakes, which I didn't have a chance to try. Next time I plan on visiting and only getting myself some of those fancy shakes!!"}
{"text":"Over the past three years I've tried three separate times to go to Black Tap in New York City only to find that the line is well in excess of two hours. With that in mind, you can imagine how excited I was to finally get a taste of Black Tap in Vegas. In short, surely the real thing is better than this imposter, because my experience at Black Tap was nothing short of mediocre.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  I feel for the servers at Black Tap I really do. They're having to churn party after party of customers with ages ranging from 2 to 102 all day and well into the evening with little reprieve, and that stress shows. By the time my girlfriend and I arrived at Black Tap around 9P, they were out of most beers, a shake or two, and the place was an absolute mess from what appeared to be a child's birthday party. Fortunately, our food came out quickly, so I really can't complain. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Black Tap is, plain and simple, expensive, but it's not to the point where I'm docking stars. This is Vegas, and I'll admit that the portions were massive before complaining about my $15.00 shake and my $20.00 burger and fries. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  So it's here that everything fell apart. My burger, fries, and onion rings were all weak, with a burger that relied heavily upon mediocre toppings for flavor, fries that were limp and devoid of flavor, and a Bam Bam Shake that was more optics than anything else. No Stars.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I'll still try to track down a visit to the original NYC location, but I'll skip the Vegas rendition going forward. No Star."}
{"text":"This place was a fun hangout atmosphere. Definitely more of a street style pub with a yummy twist of crazy milkshakes. The hamburgers are thick patty's and cooked to order. We both decided on the Texan burger and it was as big as Texas to say the least. We topped the meal off with the Colorful Cake Shake and it exceeded our expectations! A heafty piece of confetti cake with real cake batter mixed into the shake was like the cherry on top. We'd most definitely visit again and most definitely recommend to anyone! Our only set back was the price. We're willing to pay for good food, but I have a hard time paying over $15 for a burger and fries and here you burgers start at $16-$20. Not terribly priced but not quite what I was hoping for. We also split the shake because it too was a little spendy($15). I'd probably suggest splicing the shakes anyways since they are very large and full of yummy toppings!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  Pretty damn good burger.  Milkshakes are photo worthy and sides and appetizers are tasty.  Though the burgers are steep at $16-22 depending on the meat and toppings, they came with a healthy portion of fries or a different side for an extra $2.  I had the Greg Norman - a wagyu patty with blue cheese, pickle, tomato, with added egg and onion and broccoli premium side.  The burger was huge and filling.  Meat definitely did taste better than a typical patty and fried egg had that perfect pop.  The broccoli was a nice side with a Chinese twist, better than your typical fries.  As a table we tried a bunch of sides and sauces and the sweet potato fries stood out as did the aioli sauce, with the Korean sauce a close second.  The milkshakes are as good and unhealthy as advertised.  They're big enough (and expensive enough) for a meal on its own but you're in Vegas so it's worth it.  Black Tap sits on a patio on one side overlooking the canal and strip and the sports book on the other.  Really prime location in the Casino and quick service.  Wine is super expensive and they were actually out of Chardonnay when we ate at about 6pm on a Monday (really?). The beer is fine but nothing spectacular; though at $9, an IPA is actually quite a good deal for the strip.  Black Tap is one of the better burgers on the strip and you could do much worse to get sustenance and drinks."}
{"text":"My daughter was looking forward to coming here for her 18th Birthday. We had a great dinner and a fantastically sugary cotton candy milkshake! Jason was our waiter and he was attentive and courteous! We are locals and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Black Tap straight from NYC is now open inside the Venetian hotel.  Think of fun 80s hip hop joint that dishes out massive yet unique burgers, fries and overloaded milkshakes! Makes me feel like a kid again. They do have vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. Bring a friend or two, and spare time to relax after the food coma."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a good burger. This restaurant stays open late and after hours they have a live DJ that plays good music! Tap is known for their  Ice cream shakes which we will be trying next but we're have been to place twice, no disappointments."}
{"text":"Whoa, pretty fabulous place!!! My daughter loved the crazy milkshakes and I love love love the fries with truffle mayo. Would love to come back here next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"Makena was our server and he was amazing! Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. He was patient and attentive and took all our annoying photos with a smile. Will be back next time I visit! Thank you Makena! :-)"}
{"text":"Very good service, shakes, and food. They have the best burgers. Definitely recommend getting the Brooklyn Blackout shake."}
{"text":"This review is solely based off the milkshake.   I absolutely loved the decor. It feels like a hipster type restaurant. The artwork in the back was awesome. It just gives us the nice vibe without the fancy. It's a pretty casual restaurant.   We came on an empty stomach cuz I figured milkshake might be too filling. I shared the milkshake I ordered with my boyfriend.   The shake we got was the cookies and cream supreme. The milkshake itself was BOMB! Now, I hate extremely sweet milkshakes. I can't stand it.   Their milkshake was the perfect amount of sweetness. The rim parts tho, I avoided all of that. I took a bite off it and it was just too sweet so don't do it if you're picky. But the milkshake was the right amount of sweetness. Even the ice cream sandwich that was stuck in the milkshake was not extremely sweet so they got it down!  I'd like to come back and try the food here too next time. The milkshake was a bit pricey at 15 bucks but I mean that portion!!! Our service was also really fast considering it's the week of CES."}
{"text":"So worth the money to have this cool experience! The inside is beautiful, I love the decor. The menu has anything from burgers to shakes to appetizers. My favorite appetizer had to be the onion rings and the queso & chips!  Of course I came here mainly to check out the dessert bar. I got the Brooklyn black out because I love chocolate and my friend got the cotton candy shake. Talk about YUM! The service was good, our drinks were never empty and our food came quickly. we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I can say the milkshakes were really good definitely go for the milkshakes have no complaints about them. And the staff was really nice and sweet. But the food it self lacked a lot of flavor for me unfortunately. It just didn't had a taste of being burnt and no seasoning."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  Our wait time wasn't too bad. We arrived when there was a long line and we thought we were going to be waiting over 30 min.  That wasn't the case and I think our wait time was about 15 min.  From the outside the place looked small hence why we thought it would be a long wait, but when you walk inside there were more tables in the back.  The decor is very upbeat and hip long with the music.  Server was pleasant.  Very honest in his opinion of the food and descriptive in explained some of the things on the menu.   Food was excellent.  I never thought I'd be one to order these crazy shakes but I did, we did.  My brother wanted to order the shakes first which I thought was crazy.  He ordered the Sweet n' Salty Peanut Butter Shake, my sister, The Cookie Shake Vanilla Cookie Shake, and I, Cookies n' Cream Supreme Oreo Shake.  It was insane.  So I pretty much had dessert first.  Mine had a big ol Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich on top!  It was a lot to handle but it was so good!  For our meal we ordered:   They Greg Norman $20 - waygu beef, house buttermilk dill, hold the blue cheese, arugula   The Old Fashioned $18 - prime burger, crimini mushrooms, swiss (I replaced with pepper jack),  caramelized onions, horseradish sauce     I ordered The Old Fashioned and I liked it!  I wasn't too sure about the horseradish sauce but I'm pretty open minded and I enjoyed it! Especially dipping my fries into it!  The burger meat itself was big and thick.  It looks like they're freshly made.  The taste was flavorful and the burger was nice and moist.  The horseradish did complement the burger well.  My brother said the Greg Norman burger was excellent.  One of the best burgers he's tasted.  So this experience was pretty good.  Im thinking the only bad thing I'd say (which isn't super bad)  is that the music is kind of loud but that could just be me.  I think music should be heard, but I also think you should be able to hear the people at your own table.  So with all that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to Black Tap till you walk out, you and your guests are treated like royalty. From the appetizers, snacks, burgers and milkshakes you're in for an amazing \"Instagram worthy\" food experience. Some of my favorites were the Chicken Wings, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, and The Greg Norman Burger, and of course the Oreo Cookie Shake! What a great venue for an event or even a night out on the town. Yes they also serve lunch too, I recommend sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Personnel très chaleureux, service rapide et burger au top avec des frites de patate douce délicieuse ! Leurs shakes sont vraiment impressionnant et délicieux !"}
{"text":"I had been hearing a lot about Black Tap from some local friends that said it was a much try! So I made the trip down to the Venetian Hotel/casino and gave it a shot. Obviously they are well known for their insane shakes but had not heard much about the food. I decided to skip the appetizers (given I needed to save room for desert) so I went with the chicken sandwich topped with coleslaw, bacon and a side of fries. It came with a special sauce on the side which really making the sandwich (ended up asking for extra!) The place was really busy so I do understand the lack in service however I do feel their could be some improvement in that area. Now for the highly anticipated shakes, I went with the cookies and cream that came with an actual ice cream sandwich affixed to the side of the glass shake cup! To Die For! The shakes are huge but really live up to the hype in my opinion! If you're in need of a sugar fix this is the spot! Exotic shakes of all flavors to say the least!"}
{"text":"Came here for my brothers birthday. The place is nice. We ordered two appetizers, the mozzarella triangles were great but the Brussels were not so good I didn't eat them at all. My brother ordered the Texas burger he loved it but he got onion rings with it wich he did not order. So he ended up with no fries. I ordered the Californian Burger wich is the turkey burger I personally did not like the meat at all it had a very strong taste and I just ate part of it took the rest home. We ordered a shake it was the greatest thing ever. My serves was nice but he didn't introduce himself at all. Our bill was $101 for two people.  If I come back it would be for the shakes only not to eat"}
{"text":"I was so intrigued to visit the restaurant because I absolutely love craft beer and amazing foodies. However, the experience was less than average. My mom just had heart surgery and as a result, needed to be in a wheel chair. The hostess said no wheel chairs were allowed. We were a party of 8 so had to wait ... one hostess said 25 minuets and another said an hour. The hostess said she could spilt the tables into groups of fours, across the room or seat a party of 4 at one time and the other party of 4 25 minutes later. We still decided to wait to be seated all together .. as we waited we ordered 2 beers and a Kahlua  and cream. The bar didn't have kahlua or cream. So because we were wanting an hour for our table, we got a kahlua drink from the bar across the room. When finally called for our table the hostess told my mom that she couldn't bring her kahlua drink in ... well, that is when I had enough... had the bar at the restaurant had the ingredients then we would not have had to go to the bar across the lobby. Lastly, they were out of wagyu beef at 7:00pm on a Saturday!!!! AND they are lucky that  a law  suit isn't being drafted because to say wheelchairs are not allowed is against all violations. She is handicapped and now has a disability because of her heart and we were not allowed to bring in her wheelchair, which is a child's size because she is so fragile. Needless to say, horrible service skills as well as handicapped laws. Please review with your staff disability and handicapped laws..."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place I've seen videos of their shakes/burgers at their NY location and was happy to see it coming here! When I arrived I waited about five minutes when a hostess came up and offered a countertop type seating which was fine bc it's across the sports book so we could at least watch the game while eating. We ordered queso dip to start, and each our own burgers. 20/25 minutes later our burgers came but no appetizer, we informed our server and she said they've been having kitchen mess-ups so she would check on it. We decided we would cancel I.T since our meal was pretty filling, I.T came out as soon as we informed her but they gave I.T to us and took I.T off our bill. All in all, burger was good, good amount of fries I.T totaled out to $46 (including one iced tea, we got special sauce for fries $1 charge for each) cool atmosphere but I can't justify the price when you can get the same quality burgers at five guys for a cheaper price! Nonetheless great place for a casual date night!"}
{"text":"I live in NY and have been to Black Tap here. The shakes look the same but in NY they are much better tasting. They weren't bad in Vegas but if you're in NY check out Black Tap there."}
{"text":"The pizza burger was a little underwhelming for its name. The sweet potato fries were great though. Our server, Carlos, was the best! The burgers were cooked well. The milkshake needed way more ice cream in it. The only reason it's not 5-stars is because it's a much higher priced Steak-N-Shake. My wife and I had four beers, two burgers, and one shake, and it came out to $125, including tip. As Vegas locals, we could have gotten a lot more for $125 than that."}
{"text":"What a fun and great place! Decided to have lunch and this place did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere, good décor and easy to access.  Place is busy to get there with enough time and they have seating at the bar.  They also have a  nice room in the back that is great for larger groups. So, we tried the All American Burger and The Mexico City Burger. Both were cooked to perfection and prepared just right. To top it all off we began with the AMAZING shakes! Sweet N' Salty is definitely for peanut butter lovers and full of flavor.  Sour Power  is a WOW! This one was just the right amount of sour and topped with whipped cream and nerds.  The Bam Bam Shake is the Fruity Pebbles shake can we say yummmmmo!  Finally the Cake Shake is the Cake Batter shake for those Funfetti cake lover.  If you are in Vegas or a local and need a fun place to have a good burger and some amazing. FYI if you love blue cheese try The Greg Norman.  I will be back to try the other burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"I've been to black tap while in NYC over the summer so I was so excited when my husband text me saying he saw an ad on the back of a cab when we were in Vegas. He text saying I think there's a black tap here. I was so excited. It's in the Venetian. It's hip and cool and we loved it. We (myself, husband and daughter) all got the same sundaes we had when we were in NYC. I had the peanut butter, my daughter the cotton candy and my husband the cookies and cream. It's the novelty of getting this visually amazing sundae brought to you but it taste equally amazing. My husband has eaten food from here a couple times but I haven't yet. He said the food was good as well."}
{"text":"Ok. YUM. Crazy milkshakes and burgers cooked perfectly to order. Great 80s music playing and young servers with personality. A great first visit and a place we plan to go back to whenever we're in Vegas again. Our server told us that the cakes and pastries for the shakes actually get flown in from NYC (where the only other Black Tap is located). Order a milkshake. It's totally and completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I live for the shakes here I was so happy when they came from NYC. The food is good burgers are juice the location is in romantic venetian but the restaurant still gives that urban city downtown vibe that I love."}
{"text":"We went to a ton of great restaurants while we were in Vegas, but this was our favorite. It had a great vibe. The food was excellent. The crazy shakes were amazing. I thought the service was great. We sat at the bar. The bartenders were extremely friendly. We went back there some late at night as well, since the Dorsey was always packed, and TAO wasn't our jam."}
{"text":"I really was looking forward to eating here but was unfortunately unable to- after driving down here on 2 different occasions! They make you wait in a line outside of the restaurant instead of taking your name down because it's \"first come, first serve\"- and if you walk away you lose your spot.   The first time we came here the bar was empty and instead of offering to have us grab a drink while we wait for a table the hostess pointed to where we must stand in line in order to wait for a table- horrible, horrible customer service.   The second time I came here there was an excruciatingly long line and there was a hostess walking down with a note pad writing down the number in each party. When she got to us, we advised her we were a party of 2 and asked for the wait and she rudely responded 35 minutes- to which we of course asked if she could take our name down and text/ call us when the table was prepared (who wants to stand in the corner of a casino waiting in line for a half hour??!!!)  but the answer was no because FIRST COME FIRST SERVE no call ahead no reservations nothing.  Their wait system is completely irrational especially for a restaurant in the middle of a busy casino. Hostesses are rude. And the line they make you wait in is just absurd. Highly disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Very friendly staff. The manager Josh even came out and hung out with us! I would definitely recommend coming in and checking out this place. The beers and food are worth dying for! Additionally the shakes are out of this world!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to love the place based off all the buzz , pictures, ambiance, and the price of food whic is not cheap.....  So the ambiance is perfect for a friends get together to have some drinks and just relax, the decor is super hip and they play great music and all the employees are really laid back and in great moods so everything is working together perfectly. After sitting down and feeling the vibe I was ready to order and take on this whole experience, and then reality kinda set in......  I ordered a wagu beef Texan burger and a queso cheese dip which I was expecting to be off the charts based on everything I was seeing , so the first thing is they only make their beef, rare, medium rare, or well done. I prefer my burger medium well and they told me they wouldn't do that which makes me a little sad so I choose the medium rare . So the presentation of the burgers are very nice , however, there was nothing special about the taste, the bun was soggy and I couldn't tell that I had a premium that I was paying extra for. I'm not saying he burger was bad but it definitely didn't live up to a $25 price tag and the burger was pretty small. Next was the queso dip and it was average at best, it tasted like it was opened from a sams club can and I didn't even bother taking more than a couple bites .  The thing that saves this restaurant is the atmosphere and the people that work there. I will say that the shakes look amazing and it's the only reason I would try black tap again and I may have to update at a later date. I really struggled on a 3 or 4 star but the vibe and people could not overcome the lack of taste and high price tag you will pay along with the smaller size portions"}
{"text":"Extreme disappointment is an understatement. We were really looking forward to this restaurant. The service was less than desirable. The server himself was extremely rude- tried grabbing the credit card right out of one of our friend's hands without waiting for her to give it to him. And when asked questions about items on the menu- sighed and rolled his eyes and asked us what we meant. Was never told a check could only be split 3 ways and was never asked how to split the checks. He took well over 30 minutes to figure out how to split the checks and still did it wrong. We didn't even order drinks. Food had little to no taste. Our milkshake came and looked amazing - we asked for several spoons so that we could share - only to come and find out our spoon was buried under all the toppings INSIDE the milkshake. I would avoid this restaurant and would NEVER recommend to anyone. The manager at the time told us to give him time to work out the checks and he was having a bad day because his grandmother was in the hospital. If I were the manager I would have sent this server home if it was affecting his performance this much. A large party sat down beside us and were commenting on how they had not been served after sitting there while our server was busy splitting our checks (30+minutes). As our server dropped our checks off he included to inform them that checks could only be split 3 ways as he already had to deal with our mess right in front of us. Mind you, he told us that any party over 6 or more is 18% automatic gratuity and none of it goes to him- all the house staff. Not sure how much that is true. There are many more places to eat in Vegas and I would avoid this place at all cost unless you are looking for disappointment. Rude staff all around."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on Instagram. They have locations in NYC ive heard nothing but great things!! As soon as I heard they had a location here in Vegas at the Venetian I was so excited!! They have really good burgers and  shakes I recommend getting The American Burger simple but delicious! The shakes are the bomb I recommend getting the Brooklyn blackout or the cookies n cream shake! Definitely coming back bring my family!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Thursday night and this place was PACKED. We had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table.  I got their sweet n' salty shake. This thing was decked out with M&Ms on the rim and had a decadent flavor of peanut butter with chocolate. I really liked it but there's no way I would've been able to finish it. It's a lot to handle.  I also had a side of onion rings with chipotle mayo. The sauce was excellent. I really liked the pairing.  The service was great. My server was very friendly and continually checked up on us during our dinner."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers and milkshakes. While traveling for business, I ate at the bar and had great service (and menu recommendations) from the staff. Settled on the American Burger and ordered the Vanilla Cookie 'crazyshake'. Bring your appetite and sweet tooth if you expect to finish a crazyshake alone. Best for sharing There's outdoor seating as well. Would come back here with a group next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Nice place but a little dysfunctional to hosting. Hostess didn't seem friendly nor welcoming to guests coming up to the front counter. One of the hostess turned away a party of three and told them we don't have seating for three. No apologize just rude. However, we did get sat and our waiter was friendly. The waiting to be seated was out of view of the hostess counter and meaningless."}
{"text":"I was super stoked to try this place, but it's really nothing special, but the food is pretty good. My friend and I went for dinner and sat outside and it's so pretty to sit next to the water at the Venetian and watch the gondolas. We got a cookies and cream shake, the old fashioned burger with onion rings and coleslaw, the Texan burger with fries and ranch, and the fried mozz. All the food was good! Like I said, it's not a die for restaurant, but it's definitely good if you're looking for a burger/shake place to eat at."}
{"text":"We were here for the world of concrete convention with a few of our friends in January. We were seated quickly even though the place was busy. I had asked our server for a sweet cocktail and he brought over the Elderflower Frozé. AMAZING! We asked for two milkshakes something fun, and something chocolate. He brought over the Cake shake and the Brooklyn Blackout. MINDBLOWING. I also noticed that he was bussing other people's tables and helping everyone out. Our servers name was Josh. He was great! He had amazing recommendations, and always had a smile. We all had a spectacular experience and will be returning next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Omg, we had an amazing time. The shakes were incredibly good, the ranch dill sauce to die for. And the service by our Adrian was excellent.  All of my grandkids were extremely satisfied and full. Will definitely come back again and again and create more memorable times."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service  forgot to snap a picture of our burgers but they were very good."}
{"text":"Bomb burgers. Wings was cool. Must try if I'm Vegas. Dope spot. Friendly staff. Try a lot of things on menu. Won't be mad"}
{"text":"Bad service, server didnt inform us of any extra charges in our order, food took too long to arrive and was overcooked, someone who i assume was the manager came out to say sorry but that was it, no discount or anything offered for the bad experience, wont be coming back."}
{"text":"After a bumpy first visit we decided to give it another go.  We went back on a Saturday night.  The place was full and hip hop music was popping. The drinks were great (Aces High and Black Tap Mule).  Both were excellent and not overly sweet.  I ordered the Truffle Burger and my boyfriend ordered the  The Old Fashioned.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Get the crispy Brussels sprouts!  Believe it or not they were amazing (I'm craving them now).  The service was excellent, our waiter was having fun and very attentive.  We ended the night with a Sweet and Salty Shake and that hit the spot (drool).  I'm glad we gave it another shot and it's very apparent they care about their customers.  Can't wait to bring more people when they come into town!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The BEST NEW GEM in the VENETIAN!!! What a FANTASTIC MANAGER !!  It was 10 minutes before closing can't remember it was either 1 AM or 2 AM. Called  the restaurant and The hostess says they're closing. I asked to speak to the manager and he said his name was John I told him that \" we are staying at the Palazzo Hotel and we are starving. His reply was \" come on over and I'll wait for you. \"   Not only did John wait for us but to our surprise he personally served us because everybody else was cleaning up for closing.   What a AWESOME guy & MANAGER.!!!!!  5 STAR burgers & sundaes 5 STAR JOHN the manager  This place is a SOLID 10   LUCKY US, STEVEN & BLONDIE"}
{"text":"I have seen ads for their shakes all over Instagram and Facebook so we decided to take our friend for her birthday.  I think we were all too full because the four of us barely ate the two we ordered but they were still amazing! Fun for photos, fun selection to choose from and although they are $15 each it's pretty normal Vegas pricing seeing as how Johnny Rocket's charges $9 for a regular milkshake. I can't say how the food is since we only went for the shakes but I'd recommend this place based on the shakes."}
{"text":"Had a great time. We sat at the bar and Leo was our bartender. He was amazing and gave us great recommendations. We shared a burger and a shake (just do it, you know you want to). We tried the chocolate black out and want to go back for the birthday cake. The food was yummy and the staff was super cool."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this review is solely based on the shakes, service and ambience. It was a bit of a journey to locate this place but it was worth the walk. Located across from the race and sports book, makes it an excellent choice when gathering with a group of friends and to catch the latest game. Upon entering this restaurant and bar, you'll notice the place has a semi-dark vibe but it was well lit with a cool neon light artwork in front that reminded me the 90s. It was kinda like if the show Living In Color collaborated with Yard House and Sweet Factory to create a hipster style restaurant.   Our main purpose of this visit was the popular crazy milkshakes. Friends from work, Instagram and various media outlets drawn us to try them out. We decided to sit at the bar and it was a perfect setting for people watching and photo opt. Raymond, our server was friendly and attentive. He kinda knew that we wanted their shakes and immediately took our order. Everything came out in a timely manner and when the actual shakes were place in front of us. A good amount of the patrons were staring at the shakes in amazement. They were all from Europe and gave us that...these Crazy Americans look, Lol.   My sisters and I got 3 different shakes and we should've got only 1 or 2, but we got excited and greedy and went with 3 different shakes. Ended up with the Bam Bam Shake, Cookie Shake and Cake Shake. All three were delicious! The Bam Bam Shake is a fruity pebbles shake with a pop tart and laffy taffy candy. This instantly reminded us of our childhood while watching Saturday morning cartoons. It was sweet but balanced in flavor. Cake shake had a good consistent flavor with the actual cake piece on top complimented the whole experience. Cookie shake was really good, especially the ice cream cookie. The actual cookie was soft and chewy and paired well with the ice cream. We all agreed that actual ice cream used was creamy and flavorful. If I wanted to have a cheat day, this place would be on my top 5 based on the shakes. I will have to come back and try their food but this review was based on the shakes, service and ambience.  2018 Yelp Review #9"}
{"text":"Black Tap was a cool experience. My friends and I were seated outside of the main restaurant and I'm so glad they asked us to sit out there. One, the view was spectacular. Two, we were strip-side where we got to see the Mirage volcano erupt a couple of times and see the romantic gondola boats in the front of the Venetian. And three, we didn't have to wait in the massive line to get in the restaurant. Not only was the view amazing, but the food was great. My wife and I shared a Texan Burger & fries and the Cake Batter Cake shake. And my friends ordered fried pickles, the All American burger and the Brooklyn Blackout shake. The food and drinks were a lil pricey, but the restaurant is on the strip."}
{"text":"It's a really cool place they play old-school music from the 80s 90s and it's a good Vibe right next to the sports book at the Venetian"}
{"text":"It's a great hangout spot inside of the Venetian Casino and Resort. The BlackTap brought in some old school hip-hop vibes along with the 80/90's pop art. They \"Don't Sweat the Technique\" when making the best craft milkshakes I've seen and tasted. I believe their Crazy Shakes is what makes their bar/restaurant stand out aside from the furnished designs. I love that I could sit anywhere and it's a different theme to vibe from. You could even take a step out into the patio and enjoy the view of Las Vegas' replica of Venice and the Gondola rides. The All American Burgers, fries, beer and Shakes sure did brought new attention the the Venetian! Prices are fair considering it's on the Strip, so expect to pay double digits for their items."}
{"text":"If I only counted my first experience at Black Tap, the restaurant would be a solid three. Just another over-hyped, over-priced burger joint in Vegas with bad pickles and a \"crazy shake\" on the menu to draw in the tourists with their kids. Nothing exceptional, but not the worst place I've ever eaten. Unfortunately, in the Vegas spirit, I pressed my luck and tried it again.   Admittedly it was approaching closing time when we arrived at 11:30pm-ish on a Sunday for a couple of milkshakes. Sure enough, as soon as we got close, I could see the \"Sorry We're Closed\" sign complete with rope and bollards and a handful of people still finishing their meal inside the restaurant.  I worked in food service before, and I respect the \"no seating tables 30 minutes before closing time\" rule that some restaurants seem to follow.  I chalked it up to bad timing on my part and headed back to the hotel, thinking I'd try again tomorrow on my way back from the show at the RIO.   As soon as the show was over, we ran to catch an Uber, rushed back to the hotel and began the hike to the black tap. We had the Black Tap in our sights by 11:00 pm a full hour before they are scheduled to close. A schedule, that I confirmed with the waitress at the restaurant, the concierge at the Venetian, and the checkout desk at the Palazzo.  Sure enough, there were the rope and bollards, and the \"Sorry We're Closed\" sign a full hour ahead of the time they list on every web page, menu, etc. that they close. I went to the hostess and asked her what the deal was, and she claimed that from time to time they would close early if business was slow. I might've believed her if she wasn't standing in front of a restaurant still crawling with people. Then she claimed the milkshake machine was blocked off. So no shakes could be made anyway. I left frustrated.   This restaurant suffers from poor or judging by the other reviews inconsistent management. If the terrible pickles (and I mean the worst I've ever had - how do you screw up a pickle?) didn't give it away, the closing AN HOUR BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TIME certainly did. What manager in their right mind closes an hour early and in Vegas of all places?     The next morning when we were checking out, I mentioned this incident to the desk clerk at the Pallazzo, and he said, without missing a beat \"Oh you should have tried Holsteins Shakes and Buns in the Cosmopolitan, way better than the Black Tap.\"   Next time I'm in Vegas I think I'll take that advice and I'd recommend you do the same.  PS. About these pickles, I want you to imagine one of those conversion vans from the 80-90s that had plush carpet in the back. Imagine you bought one of those with about 200k miles on it, that had been used to ferry kids animals and lumber around for the last 30 years with only the occasional spot vacuuming. Now imagine cutting a small piece of fabric from that carpet and eating it. This is the best approximation for what their pickles taste like.   Also, their onion rings are too thick, but at this point, that's just splitting hairs."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite burger places in town. Prices were a little more than I thought but way worth it. My girlfriend and I went here about a week ago for our anniversary and the staff was super nice. I got the Mexico City burger and she got the California burger. Both very good.         An to our surprises but delight we were gonna get a shake anyways; but got their special shake the Golden Knight Shake. It looked amazing and was 10 times better than it looked. With a cake puck standing on the outside of the milkshake. Overall experience there was great. Would definitely go back again !"}
{"text":"Such a nice place. The food was really really amazing, the temp on my burger was perfectttt. The brussel sprouts were omg so good and don't even get me started on the milkshakes. To top it all off I had the nicest server named Buddy he was very helpful and attentive and on it before I could even ask for anything. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had. Large size right amount of toppings. Got the Texan with a salad. Husband got same with fries. We both shared with our adult daughter and cleaned plates with not a crumb left. Meat was perfectly cooked and toppings were fresh. Could work on their vinaigrette as it was completely separated- emulsified would have been better. Will definitely have to check out the one in NYC"}
{"text":"Our group of 10 came in to try their crazy, fun looking shakes. Unfortunately, that's all we could say about their shakes. Take away the fun, outrageous toppings, the shakes were just not good. You can get a way better milkshake at In-and-Out or Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to be there for their grand opening & it was the best way to start our Vegas trip after an 11-hour drive (2 in heavy traffic) from the bay! From the moment we walked in the atmosphere was perfect! Smiling, happy, & warm greeters & servers, great old school hip hop & a vibe that was energetic & family friendly.   We weren't really hungry, we were there primarily for the shakes, but ordered food anyway. Glad we did... the food was delicious! Highly recommend the teriyaki broccoli & wings.   And, of course, the shakes... THE SHAKES! If for pictures & posting purposes alone... so well worth it! Lol! Thank goodness they were really good to boot.   The only thing I thought peculiar were the teeny tiny water glasses, but the staff was on it... our glasses were never empty.   Such a great overall experience... My husband even commented, \"I want a place just like this.\"   I wanted to leave a review as soon as I got back to the hotel but it being their first day of operations & all they didn't have a Yelp page yet. So, here you go! We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Took my bf for his birthday and plus we've been wanting to try this place out. The food was honestly mediocre nothing special. We ordered the fried pickles and they were really bland no type of flavor at all. The burgers were good but they were more on the \"done\" side then \"medium\" which is what we ordered but they were still okay. The milkshakes were really pretty, we ordered the cookies n cream and it was tasty but the look of it was really the reason I wanted it lol  Overall this place was decent but nothing I would go and drive for ?"}
{"text":"We walked in around 1230pm on a Monday and luckily there was no wait for a party of three and even had some patio seating open. All the staff was pretty friendly and the atmosphere of the spot was clean and fun. Started off with some ice water that is in the bottle that they leave on the table for you to refill yourself if they can't make it back when you're low. Ordered from fried mozzarella and changed the sauce to marinara. Also got the Cookie Shake which is like a hard childcare chip cookie and a vanilla shake and tons of cream and cookie crumbs. The shakes there are so outrageous they make the entire meal. They need to serve the shakes on a large plate rather than on a tiny saucer since it drips and spills all over. We then ordered the Pizza burger $17, The California burger $17 and the Greg Norman burger with wagyu beef and blue cheese $20. All burgers come with their regular fries but you can upgrade to sweet potato or onion rings for $2 more. One thing I didn't like is I ordered ranch on the side for my fries and they don't tell you his but they charge you $1 each for that! I think anytime there is an up charge they should let you know. Food came out quickly and was tasty. It's a gourmet speciality burger and shake shop on the strip and if you're lucky enough to sit outside you get to watch the gondolas pass. They play pretty good mix of music outside too. All in all I enjoyed my experience and the bill came to $70 something but we had a 20% discount for casino employee."}
{"text":"My friend and I got a coupon for a free crazyshake with the purchase of a burger, so we went in attempt to utilize that.   First of all, if you're a local or are just parking in the venetian, this place is a little difficult to find in he casino. We found it after walking around for about 15 minutes asking how to get to it, and once we got to the hostess and showed her the coupon, we were told we needed to redeem them at a desk, which took another 5 minutes to find. From there we needed to get a players card. Long story short, we aren't 21 years old and couldn't redeem the coupon but we went to Black Tap anyway to see what the hype was.   We knew the milkshakes were huge and wanted to indulge so my friend and I split one- the chocolate brownie one. It was alright, but it looked cool! It's more of an aesthetic experience with the beautiful view of the \"lake\" in front of the Venetian and the artsy decorations inside. However, splitting just a milkshake and fried pickles was $25. I guess that's what you get when dining on the strip. Our waitress was very friendly at least!   For locals, I'm not sure if it was worth the trip but we got some cute pictures on the patio where we sat."}
{"text":"Black Tap Vegas was amazing!   Couldn't be happier with the service and of course the food.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their burgers and the shakes!    Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"How can you charge $22 bucks for a burger and not have the ability to cook it to the right temperature what a disappointment ... how an experienced cook takes a burger to well done when I asked for medium rare hoping for medium (worse case scenario) and on top of that there menu says all burger cooked to medium (fake news) My mom and son were happy with their food  Never tasted the burger my motto is you get one time to get it right ... fried pickles and onions rings were ok And is it possible to have the server pour your water ..: this place is way over priced for the service or lack there of .....not a happy camper"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place, but it was honestly a let down.   The shake was amazing, but I can always get a cheaper shake at Jack in the Box, for the same great taste.   The burger was mediocre, and they messed up my order. I ordered the truffle burger and they gave me the Texas burger, which I waited for my new burger for 30-45 minutes. I get that people make mistakes, we're human, so I tried to act polite about it, because I used to work with customers too, so I get it. Once the waiter brought out the correct burger, he then said, \"is this the right one?\" with such a bad attitude, at that point I was over this place. I just wanted to leave. Then once we got the bill, my burger wasn't even discounted let alone free, because at that point, with his bad attitude, it should've been at least discounted, but of course not, since this restaurant is in Vegas. I didn't voice my opinion, I didn't want to make things worse for our group.   The waiter had the nerve to add 18% gratuity to our receipt because we were a big group, which I understand, but with the service he gave us, he didn't deserve it.   So to wrap it up: save your money and just go to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I was super excited to take my God daughter Riley here. I was expecting a stellar burger, tasty fries and an out of this world milkshake.  What i got was, a burger so big, the first 7 bites were just plain ground beef. So much meat, that i literally gagged. All my toppings and flavor were hidden in a fried onion ring on top and i had to eat half the burger to get to the flavor. And honestly i was so disgusted by the endless amout of flavorless meat. I just boxed it up and gave it to my hubby. The fries, are so boring and flavorless. Basic frozen French fries. The turkey burger was delicious. Had some guacamole on top i believe, it was great.  The birthday cake milkshake was just a piece of cake on top of a disgusting cake batter flavored milk shake.  Cool photo op place.  Location is super hard to find. Food was flavorless and over priced. I'm a local and will probably never be back. Much better burger fries and milkshakes on the strip."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 Black Taps in NYC, and the LV location didn't disappoint. I love how the shake area is on display. The staff was super duper nice. My crazy shake was delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a picture of a cool looking milkshake to post on Instagram, then this is your place. If you're looking for anything else... you'll be very disappointed. Gotta be honest our group only came here for desert because we ate dinner elsewhere so we just ordered the milkshakes. We had the birthday cake shake, the cookie shake, and just a plain chocolate milkshake. Everybody took pictures but nobody finished they're warm disappointing milkshake. I'd rather go to sonic 4 times in a row than to spend the same price here again. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Great burger place- had the All-American with bacon, it was fantastic. The burgers were pretty thick, which I don't usually love, but this was cooked to perfection and very juicy/savory. The fries were average, and I did not love the onion rings- usually like the more heavily breaded ones.   The milkshakes were insane, and definitely worth getting. The cookies and cream was #1 by far, but enjoyed the cake shake too (the cake on top was very moist)."}
{"text":"Like many others, it was the photos of Black Tap's crazy shakes on social media that piqued my interest. When a friend and her daughter came to town on vacation, we decided to have dinner here on a Wednesday evening.   There was no wait, and we were seated in a comfy booth by the shake makin station which was pretty cool. I definitely dig the overall vibe at Black Tap... casual yet somewhat upscale feeling at the same time, servers wear t-shirts with lyrics from classic hip hop songs, the music played was all over the place but all good jams.   Our server was awesome, I wish I could remember his name. He arrived quickly after we were seated to drop off a carafe of water and answer any questions we had. When we ordered our food he made sure to ask if we wanted our shakes with our meal or afterward and put the order in with the kitchen accordingly.   We decided to start out with some fried pickles which were super tasty. My dining partner and I shared the Old Fashioned burger. It was alright, very juicy but nothing overly special in my opinion. The star of the show was absolutely the Fruity Pebble milkshake. With a strawberry pop tart, fruity pebble treat, candy and TONS of delicious cereal this shake was everything that I had hoped for.   Total damage for an app, 2 burgers, 2 crazy shakes and 1 normal shake with tax and tip was just over $100 which isn't too ridiculous for the Strip. I'd return for the shakes but not for the burgers.    Yelp Reviews 2018 22/100"}
{"text":"Glad my daughter finally got to try but I think the shakes are overhyped.  And I don't understand why the cake batter shake has a $2 upcharge. Isn't $15 enough?  Why does the cake cost $2 more but the other shakes have cookies and brownies and cotton candy galore but the silly cake slice costs more?  It's not organic or anything so I don't understand.  Just another junky topping so not sure how this costs more than the brownies or cookies.  I just dont like the feeling of paying more than $15 for a shake. ha. The wagyu burger salad was great. We shared that also."}
{"text":"Best burger I had in Vegas. I would recommend this place to everybody. The bar service was friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere and the staff was beyond efficient! Food was very good and the shakes were awesome! Shakes remind me of Holsteins, but the shake I had was a little less of a meal than Holsteins (which was awesome because I also ordered a burger). Wagyu burger was pretty good and the server Carlos let us know how the meat is usually cooked to help us make our choices with meat.  Carlos you rocked!  Our table was cleared as we were eating but not in a way that interrupted us or the flow of conversation. Great staff and I wish you guys the best of luck!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, shakes taste like McDonald's shakes, service is extremely slow and forgetful about bringing drinks, and it's automatically 18% tip on 6 people."}
{"text":"After our experience, Samantha promptly emailed me back to resolve the matter. She happened to be visiting the Las Vegas location the next week and set up a convenient time for myself and my boyfriend to come in and meet her and have dinner on her.   We arrived at 7pm and we were sat once again outside in the patio area, by our request. (Side note: the family of ducks wandering around is beyond adorable!) Samantha assured we had an attentive server. I wish I caught his name because his service was phenomenal. He greeted us in a timely manner, took our order, and quickly delivered our drinks to the table.   We ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich once again and the Greg Norman burger with raw onion and bacon. We specified we would like the burger cooked medium. We chose fries as both of the sides.   Samantha came out shortly after to chat with us about our previous experience. She mentioned how that does not reflect the service they hope to provide their guests. She was super sweet and apologetic and even ordered a few appetizers for us to try out. She ordered the Teriyaki Broccoli and Fried Moz, which both were delicious. My boyfriend and myself particularly liked the Teriyaki Broccoli the most!   Our food eventually made it out and our burger was perfectly cooked medium! Hallelujah! The Greg Norman burger stole the show. I'm not even kidding.. the burger was so delicious and juicy. It was by far the best thing we ate that night. This is what I had been expecting my first time! This burger finally lived up to the hype and the price. Of course, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich tasted amazing. The Korean BBQ sauce that is served on the side is delicious.   I would like to mention our server was extremely attentive with filling our drinks and clearing plates during our whole meal. Silent service is important to me and he was AWESOME! Once we were finished with dinner, we went ahead and ordered the Cookie Shake. Samantha joined us to ask us how dinner was and to let us know she had ordered another surprise shake for us.   Both shakes made it out and they look incredible and Instagram-ready! The Cookie Shake was totally my jam as it was the perfect balance between vanilla and cookie and also wasn't too thick. The surprise shake was the Golden Knights Shake, in honor of the Las Vegas hockey team making it to the Stanley Cup; my boyfriend loved that shake!   Thank you SO much to Samantha for making this right. Our experience this night was exactly what we were hoping for the first time around. The service was incredible and the food was delicious. Overall, Samantha went above and beyond for us and I'm truly grateful for that."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a little confusing to find in the Venetian, its located by the poker/sport tv area. Loved the atmosphere of this place, we sat outside. Waiter was nice, he was very helpful with the shake options, what to recommend. We all had burgers, I had the BBQ burger and my friend she had the Pizza burger. Really good portion if food, burgers were pretty good size. They were delicious:) We also had the cake shake. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...service...food portions are crazy big...must try the $15 milk shakes. Omg amazing..had to walk off lunch first."}
{"text":"1 star because the food was decent. Unfortunately the service spoiled any good taste we had left in our mouth.  Creative burgers at comparative prices for Vegas stip. Outdoor patio was inviting/cute (we we're a group of 7 girls) ducks from the nearby \"canal\" were enjoying any crumbs.  Our server had NO personality. Never said his name and unfortunately none of us have our receipts. Upon check out he informed us that he could split the check 3 ways... No big deal, we figured it out. But unfortunately he could not understand what went on what card. Even when we Wrote out the items on said receipts. The manager was finally involved and not sure why, he was no assistance.  On our way out.. I verbalized to said manager,  that our experience was not enjoyable. The manager then stated that the server found out some personal news and it was \"messing with him\"  We all have lives outside of work, we understand it's had to compartmentalize certain things. If that item is affecting your performance, you should go home or take a break. Not make our dinner a headache in a town of pure entertainment.  TL:DR, food fine, bad service experience"}
{"text":"We were really excite to try this place but we were very disappointed. The food is okay and the shakes are good but my bill was 93.00$ for two burgers, two shakes, and two iced teas that were so watered down it was like drinking water.  I think it is a great concept but  we won't be back for the price."}
{"text":"If you're craving a good juicy burger or a yummy, ginormous shake, be sure to check this place out! Black Tap is located in The Venetian Hotel. If you enter through the main entrance off the strip, just take the escalator down one floor, hang a left and you'll see it on your left hand side.   The place has a cool and funky 80s' theme going with fun vibe. It seems to be a hit so there may be a short wait but it's well worth it. The staff is very friendly and attentive. And the burgers are delicious! My friends and I liked it so much that we went back the very next day for round 2. My favorite is the Old Fashioned Burger with Bacon of course!  They also have a full bar stocked with most of your favorite poisons. BUT, the bar that you really want to check out here is the shake bar. These shakes are some of the craziest, best looking, ginormous shakes I've ever seen. They have a bunch of different toppings and flavors. You can easily share  one between 2 or 3 people.   Cool spot, check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to go here for his birthday dinner simply for the amazing shake. He had a cereal and a slice of mint chip ice cream cake from Cold Stone for breakfast but wanted more of an indulgent dinner. We sat outside at 6pm and although at 100 degrees in late June but the patio was shaded enough that it was nice.  Luckily it is Restaurant Week here in Vegas! Depending on the establishment it can be for a week to a month where prix fix meals are heavily discounted and a portion of the bill goes to 3 Square. He asked for the 3 course meal- selection of 2 appetizers, 3 mains and any basic shake for $30, $5 of which goes to the charity. This does not sound like much but usually all that come to $50. I cannot eat beef so I passed.   We shared the fried pickles. Usually not a fan but delicious! He asked if he could upgrade giving the extra cost. He added an egg to the All American burger for $1 and upgraded to a gourmet shake from a basic for $6. Still, an awesome deal!   I asked for an Old Fashioned with a turkey burger sub and a Greek salad instead of fries (a $2 upgrade). The only bad thing is that instead of the salad they gave me fries. Within 3 minutes the salad was given. Hey, free fries! Mistakes happens and it was quickly remedied.   I was way too full to eat half the meal so I skipped on the shake to taste a little of his. He ordered the Brooklyn Blackout, holy smokes it was monstrous! I ate a little to taste and it was delicious! He could barely finish it.   So, prices are high but you get the bang for the buck with size portions and quality. I did slip that it was his birthday, no awkward singing but no comps. Still, I feel we were given more than the price. Plus, as we were outside so the view was really nice, of the gondolas and LV BLVD.   If you want to go to try it out, now it the time. A 3 course dinner is heavily discounted and goes to a good cause. Any other time, just was worth it."}
{"text":"Loved it!! We had an all American burger with blue cheese instead of cheddar, a side of onion rings, and the cookies and cream shake! Everything was so tasty. I like my burgers cooked mostly all the way but it still had plenty of flavor. The onion rings were gigantic! And paired nicely w the dill buttermilk sauce. And the shake was as amazing tasting as it looks! The portions were huge we shared everything and still ended up super stuffed. We sat outside on the patio which is right at the end of the canal in the ventian. Beautiful view and our service was perfect! It made for a really fun date night!"}
{"text":"Finally a location on the west coast! The actual restaurant is on the lower floor of the Venetian by the poker room. When we arrived there was a line for the host stand and when someone came around asking for our party number we found out you could sit at the bar without waiting! The bar is full menu and if you have a smaller group it could reduce your wait time. They also offer outdoor seating. Of course we had to order a shake and we were not disappointed. For $15 it may seem overpriced but the shake can easily be split between 2 people. I got the aces high drink and it wasn't what I was expecting. The drink was too tart for me but I think that is personal taste over quality. I highly recommend this place for your next dessert!!"}
{"text":"Really Disappointed in this restaurant. The food is ok and the customer service could use improvement. The burgers are a bit mediocre and overpriced. I enjoyed this location in New York way more than I did in Vegas. The hostess was Extremely Rude and really didn't care to do any work at all including her job of seating me. The burger was decent. If you must come here I'd skip dinner and just get a shake."}
{"text":"As of right now, for the past few instances I've been here, I can say that people around me enjoy most of the burgers, brews, and appetizers here.  The staff was decent, as for the food I only tried The Vegan.  It was pretty good.  Needs a bit of a touch up to keep it on par with other vegan burgers out there.  The beer options they offer are pretty diverse.  I only drink a select few but this place is a great spot to talk and chill with a few pals when walking through the Venetian!"}
{"text":"Had to make this a stop on my last visit to Vegas! Fun environment, good service, good food. Come hungry! My daughter had the Pizza burger, I had the Vegan burger, and we each ordered a shake. Yes, it was too much food...but we knew what we were walking into. The shakes are too fun. I would definitely love to see mini versions as an option though. I would definitely return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I read plenty of reviews on Black Tap and decided to go and check it out and I was not disappointed!!! The atmosphere is fantastic with a cool retro 80's vibe but the food is to die for!!! We ordered the Old Fashion burger and let me tell you there isn't anything old Fashion about it!!! The burger was moist and juicy with caramelized onions and mushrooms with just the right amount of Swiss cheese to put me on cloud 9! Then for dessert what more can I say then milkshake, milkshake, milkshakes!!! Pick one, pick two, pick them all and they are all unbelievable!!! We ordered the cotton candy milkshake and it was divine while others around us raved about the cookies and cream, the chocolate peanut butter and the birthday cake!!! Don't delay and make your way to Black Tap you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. The only reason why I'd let this have 1 star is because the food was decent.  Last night I had my birthday dinner, which was a party of 15. And I had the worst experience from the moment I got there to the moment I left!   First, I called a week ahead to make reservations for my birthday in which I was then informed that they do not take reservations and they told me to call the morning of my party and they would reserve a table for my party. As I did. Yesterday morning I called as soon as they opened and they ensured me that I would have the table I wanted and not to worry. Just to be safe, I called when I was on my way to the Venetian and they then told me they didn't have any tables and they would only sit us at separate tables. I told them that it's a party and I would like to be seated at one table. They told me they would do so.   When I got there, I talked to the hostess and told them that we had a reserved table and she said that they did not have the table and that I had to wait in a long line and the wait would be an hour. Another worker came out and said that she could seat us and also told me they have a cake fee where they would charge me per slice for them to hold my cake in the kitchen and to cut it. I told her I would just do it myself so I don't have to pay and she said that's fine. She then seats me outside at 2 different tables.   30 minutes after my entire party arrives, our server comes out and asks if we were ready to order... but we never got menus!! I also asked her if she could turn on the mister because it was very very hot outside. She came back with menus and told me the mister was broken. So I asked for iced water. Another 20 minutes pass and she finally comes out with warm water and takes our order. After we get our food and eat, we had to continuously ask her for water!   As I was about to do my birthday cake, the server said she was going to charge me and I told her the previous worker told me they would wave the fine. In which she brought her manager to us where he basically scolded us like we were children. (I had made goody bags for my friends with drinks and all the servers were saying how cool it was and such a good idea. We were never informed at any point prior to being scolded that we could not have it). He said we aren't allowed to have the goody bags and that we were supposed to pay for the cake fee (WHICH I BROUGHT AND CUT MYSELF SO WHY WOULD I BE CHARGED???) He said he wanted our business but there were rules. Which is understandable, but we were never ever informed of any rules!!! They knew it was a birthday party as I made that very clear on the phone multiple times and they never once told me about a cake fee?   LASTLY, our server messed up all of our checks. I informed her before everyone got there we wanted separate checks and she told me that would be fine and easy.   She gave us all of our checks back and they were all wrong. Personally, my check was for $45 and some change, I gave her my card and she came back and charged me for $65 and some change. I was not aware of the extra charge when I gave her my credit card, but left it as I was already pissed off and just wanted to leave. As for the rest of my party, they all had trouble with their checks and cards.   After dinner, my friends and I were all trying to figure out how many Uber's we needed and we were outside the restaurant to the side and the hostess said that we needed to leave and could not be there. Why were we getting kicked out from a restaurant that we just spent hundreds at? And we weren't even in the restaurant!! We were in the hotel casino waiting. Not causing any problems or anything.  The whole night was absolutely ridiculous and ruined my whole birthday. Truly one of the worst experiences at any restaurant I ever have, ON MY BIRTHDAY."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to grab a late night shake and burger on the strip. The shakes are amazing! They are themed and over the top. I love the cookies and cream shake as it's piled high with cookies, whip cream, and chocolate on top of rich cookies and cream ice cream. The burger was cooked to perfection and accompanied by fries perfect to milkshake dipping. The service has always been fantastic! Great place."}
{"text":"We got the American Burger w/ a fried egg & cake shake  The burger tasted amazing so did the fries & the shake!!!  The ONLY downside is the price is expensive HOWEVER since the meal can adequately feed 2 people.. I give this place 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"What a great place to get a burger and a shake. Our great waitress Kendra was a delight to have with us today. I had the All American Burger and it was amazing and delicious. The patty was perfect and the bun held up perfectly with the burger. I also had the vanilla shake and it was crisp and delicious. Def going here again!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if people are all just living off the hype or what's going on here but this was definitely top 5 most lackluster burger I've ever eaten in my entire life and I've eaten A LOT of burgers. The mozzarella triangles were extremely greasy and tasted like old oil. The onion rings left much to be desired and the burgers were BLAND. Like they didn't even use salt and pepper at the very least. We spent over $100 for 4 people for this unsatisfying dinner and would've been far more pleased at In N Out. The 2nd star is for the fact that they kindly made a grilled cheese sandwich for my 2 year old which isn't on the menu (she enjoyed it). We also had the cake shake. The shake itself is pretty good but the cake slice is DRY. Overall, I'd probably recommend this place to an enemy, definitely not a friend."}
{"text":"Been waiting to get down here after missing them in NYC.  Was worried about a long line but had no problem walking right in.  Food and shakes were delivered immediately and everything was fantastic!  Our server was a pleasure too.  It's pricey but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Well I was very, very excited to try these wonderful CrazyShakes that I kept seeing Facebook ads for. Unfortunately on a recent trip for dessert for my birthday back on March 30th we had such a horrendous experience with service that I couldn't even bear to leave 2 stars. I waited quite a while before writing the review to let myself cool off after how mad we all were thinking I cold write a more generous review because the shakes were quite spectacular, but that is not the case, I still feel the same several weeks later!  Since it was a Friday night we expected there to be a long line. There was NO line and the restaurant seemed only about half full table wise around 8pm. There were 3 girls at the hostess stand all furiously chatting away about their personal lives. One of our party of 4 walked up and said 4 please. She replied with hold on, goes and looks at the tables I assume and comes back and grumpily says follow me, seated us in a booth directly behind the center bar where the shakes are made, dumps our menus and takes off quickly.   Our server Luis came promptly over to our table upon being seated so THAT part I give him credit for. He offered water, we accepted and promptly ordered 4 milkshakes and I myself ordered fries to have a salty snack knowing the sugar overload that was headed my way. Everything after was a nightmare......  We waited about 20 minutes. Still no Luis, still no fries. I was worried the fries would come out before the shakes. Luis was over next to the server's computers standing with several other servers chatting away. During this time of waiting a group of 4 guys who were clearly tourists and VERY loud and drunk sitting in the booth next to us managed to drunkenly flail their arms and knock one of the mason jars holding straws off their table and it smashed on the ground and the shards of glass went flying like bullets. I had open toe shoes and had pieces to shake off my foot and the guys in our group shook them off the creases in the bottom legs of their pants. I looked around and a few servers were whizzing by as it happened (clearly they could hear it), the servers talking by the computers could hear, the couple kids behind the shake bar were standing at the back and I'm sure they could hear too. Nobody even so much as GLANCED in the direction that worked there, only the couple other tables of guests in the area looked over and watched. The guys as drunk as they were even looked around bewildered. Nobody ever came over to clean up the glass or ask what happened.   So still waiting on shakes we had sipped all the water away. Suddenly some young girl came whizzing over and set our 4 shakes on the table without a word and runs off. I'm looking around at this point, still no Luis, still no fries. We ate our shakes fairly quickly (about 15 minutes) and then sat. And sat and sat. At this point I'm losing all patience. The sugar overload was killing me, I was craving both water and salt, of which I had none. We waited over HALF AN HOUR with empty shakes and glasses just staring at ceiling. Luis for the majority of this time had been standing by the computers yakking away with the other servers who all spent a half hour doing NOTHING. I finally kept turning around and still staring them down in disbelief. He must have finally gotten the clue because he comes over and in a walk by fashion without stopping moving his feet says super chipper and happy \"are you guys all set anything else I can get you? Ok I'll be your cashier when your ready\". Drops the check and beelines back to registers to talk. We didn't even have a chance to answer if we wanted anything else or to tell him of the problems (like my missing fries, the freaking glass in my shoes, the empty water glasses the fact that he never ONCE in an hour came back from point of taking our order in a time that spanned an hour to an hour and a half). At this point I didn't even want to tell him what was wrong because there would have been a string of expletives involved that I felt inappropriate at the time.    We paid and left a $5 tip. I have NEVER in my life even with somewhat poor service cut a tip short. I work in the industry & my spouse and I have a rule....any time we eat out (we eat out a LOT) for any of our small checks that are $20-$60 which is our usual tab we leave $20 tip. Could be a $20 IHop check, we leave $20. As we left and passed by the hostess stand near 9:30 the same girls were standing there bitching about their lives to each other still. I tried to make eye contact to say thank you but nothing. No bye, thank you for coming, nothing. Just totally involved in facebook, boyfriends and god knows what else. So unprofessional it's disgusting. I said screw it at this point and stormed off into the casino.   I have NEVER had such awful unprofessional experience in my life!! Sucks because the shakes were so fun! Management needs to do something about their staff here!!"}
{"text":"After years of seeing the decadent shakes on social media, I finally made my way here while on vacation in vegas. Service was alright but the food was amazing! I would highly recommend the truffle burger! The hamburger patty itself was huge- super thick. Make sure you come here with an appetite because after dinner we split the cake shake which is served with a slice of white cake and sprinkles on top. Menu items were a little on the pricey side but nothing you wouldn't expect from vegas. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Drinks and food are unique and very tasty! It's a place where you would love to have casual dining with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Service with attitude.   The location on yelp isn't accurate and the restaurant just opened so it isn't on the directory yet. It's in the Venetian near Noodle Asia.  So we got to the restaurant and we stood in line to be seated. There were about 4 people ahead of us and no one behind us. The people in front of us got seated and the hostess came out and asked how many were in our party. We said four. The line to wait got longer. Maybe about 15 minutes later, the hostess walks past me and covers half her face with the menus and told me to not notice what she was about to do. She skips us and goes to the group behind us because they were her \"friends\". I overheard her say \"where is the rest of the party? I can't seat you guys if you guys aren't here. I'll get in trouble.\" No you'll get in trouble for the poor customer service you've provided and catering to your friends first. So instead of tending to us and seating us since we were first in line she stood behind us and starts chatting away with her friends in line. The other hostess comes out and asked us if we had two in our party and we corrected her and said four and she argues with us and said \"no you told me two.\" How about instead of arguing with your customers, you actually treat them decently and seat the people according to who got there first instead of catering to your friends. The attitude doesn't stop there. When we finally got seated (which there were many booths that could seat four available so I don't know why it took 25 minutes to stand in line and wait), we asked for more forks since there weren't any left in the jar. Instead of just saying \"sure I'll get some more for you\", the server smirks back \"aren't there some next to you?\" And we had to tell her there are no more. Our server walked by five times and never refilled our water until the end. When we were ready to order the shakes and tried to catch her attention she just walked past by.   Overall, our experience dining here was very unpleasant because of the staff. The food was quite pricey and very salty. We would not come back and would rather go to another place with better service. One that doesn't come with so much attitude."}
{"text":"Epic fail! I had such high hopes for this place. Not sure if we just caught them too early upon opening. Our waiter had ZERO personality and literally could not have messed up our order any more. My husband had an egg on his burger, but it came out so raw and runny. He asked for a cooked egg and about 30 minutes later an egg gets delivered to the table next to us. Was he supposed to let his burger sit there getting cold? Just awful and they had the nerve to charge for the egg after we told him that obviously the burger was eaten while waiting for the friggin egg. My burger would have been decent if they hadn't charred it into a hockey puck. I asked for medium! I was so hungry that I couldn't bear to wait for another one. Then the table next to us gets a crazy shake they didn't order. When we ordered our shakes, it came out a completely melted messy disaster. A shake is supposed to be thick, not like water. If you want a good shake and burger, head over to the Cosmopolitan to Holstein's where they know how to cook food."}
{"text":"Ok, me and some friends are here last night.  I read the reviews and I thought I was in for so typical over priced bull crap... NAH FAM!  The Greg Norman burger was crazy good! I had the cake milkshake was everything thing I thought it would be.  Customer service was solid so I had no complaints at all man (shoutout to the swole waiter with the glasses, homie was super helpful).  I'm local and I can say it was worth every penny.  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Crappy service! treated us like they were doing us a favor! Food on menu looked delicious but after we waited at the bar for 15 minutes for them to even take our order then we were just turned off by the whole experience."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to having lunch here, but left disappointed.  Our medium ordered burger arrived (beyond) well done and VERY dry - - needed to drink extra just to get the burger down.  Ordered the Sweet N' Salty peanut butter crazy shake.  While it was incredibly visually appealing, the actual size is very small, and flavor was average at best.  Not sure if we hit a bad time or bad day, but would recommend finding other similar restaurants for a better experience."}
{"text":"After finding them on Instagram awhile ago and then seeing they added a Las Vegas location, we had to give it a try. We were driving through Vegas and stopped just for their milkshake. It is worth the picture alone. The milkshakes are pricey but they put everything on it. The 2 of us couldn't even finish it. Worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service and food. I came here a few weeks ago with 5 friends so six of us total. We were looking over appetizers and ordered their \"fried mozz\" and fried pickles. The server didn't forewarn us, but the fried mozz was a 4 pc. for $10! So that was nice, having to split that amongst 6 people.   Throughout our visit, we saw 3 different food runners bring food to the table next to us that they didn't order. One runner literally dropped an f-bomb after walking out with the duplicate milkshakes that those patrons were already sipping on.  We all ordered burgers and not one of us said \"this is really good\" we were all just surprised that they were just \"okay\". Considering I got a $19 Mexico City burger, I expected it to be crazy good. But the flavors of it just seemed mix-matched, it didn't blend well and neither did my girlfriend's Greg Norman burger. Their menu makes items sound really good, but the actual food did NOT deliver.   But to top it off, I was waiting outside their restrooms for one to open up. An elderly gentleman starts to walk out of one, and as I start to step toward the door one of the servers cuts me off and walked right into the restroom. It was unbelievable. Seriously the worst experience, considering myself and my party are all in the service industry. For this being a restaurant at the Venetian we all expected great food and great service, and it was honestly mediocre all-around.  Also, spoke with the manager on my way out. Pretty young brunette woman. I explained the gist of our experience, and she apologized just once and honestly just seemed like she was just waiting for me to stop talking. She was uninterested and made no attempt to make things right. At any restaurant any of us have ever worked at, the manager on duty would have gone above and beyond to make our experience more favorable. But nope. Thanks Black Tap!"}
{"text":"Menu: Crazy shakes, crazy burgers, and more.   Price: shakes range from $10-$15. Burgers range from $12-$20.   Environment: Hipster, casual ambiance, great for date night   Customer service: Bartender was friendly.   Checked in with us frequently.   What I ordered:  * Sour Power - If you love sour gummies or sour worms, this is your milkshake. Creamy goodness with a hint of tang.  * Bam Bam - Fruity pebble lovers unite! * Mexican City Burger - Burger patty was cooked to perfect and stayed juicy. Pickled jalapeño was a great twist.   Overall: I wish the menu was more affordable but I would return for another fun night of milkshakes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place a lot since they have one in New York that I wanted to go to every time I'm there. I was excited when they opened here. It's located inside the Venetian Hotel. It's really cool the way they have it decorated inside and it's trendy and hip. Now the food wasn't that great I don't think they're meant to be a restaurant I think they should just be a shake and bar place. I ordered a vegan burger, it was so soggy and just spilled out everywhere I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered onion rings and they were the large cut onion rings I mean large it was unnecessary. The fries were the thick cut not wedges but steak fries and I don't like thick I think thin ones taste so much better. The ooh ahh factor were the shakes of course but in all honesty who can eat all of that with all the toppings. It looks so cute and pretty you don't wanna mess it up. The shakes were like $14-$18, very high-priced I don't know if it's worth it , maybe to say you had one but is that really worth it? We left there hungry. The service was great, the music was great 80s and 90s :). but I don't know if I would come back there again the food just didn't do it for me or the people I was with. We spent $190 on my burger and onion rings, 2 small salads, side of fries, 3 shakes and a mini one. We could've eaten at yard house for less. (I love yard house food, always consistent)"}
{"text":"I really researched this place as I love New York and wanted to see if it held up to the hype. It truly did. We came in with a big party of course.  The atmosphere very trendy,  the staff was real chill especially because it was about 1am..And this Crazy Milkshakes didn't disappoint at all.  The menu is real fun especially the drink side. I walked away satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed with the black tap restaurant. They over compensated with the lack of flavor in their burgers with a abnormal amount of salt. The shakes are way to sugary almost to the point where it was inedible. The only plus is the music played but still not worth the trip down."}
{"text":"The only thing better than their shakes, is the customer service. Very impressed by the quality of their servers.  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place, this was our first time staying at the Venetian and this place was recommended when we checked in. We ha an amazing burger and great service from Leo the bartender. I would definitely recommend this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Flavorful but slightly overcooked burger. Unimpressive meat. Not exactly sure why there's an hour long line in the NYC locations, but happy I went here in Vegas and just sat up at the bar. Would have been more upset if I actually waited a long time to eat that."}
{"text":"I have ate at this location (Vegas) and the NYC location and loved both! The atmosphere is great, food is excellent, and of course the shakes are fun/to die for. Highly commend if visiting either city!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com! I'm not a big burger person, but I thought their burgers were pretty legit. 4 of the people in our party got the crazy shakes and they were definitely worth the money! 1600 calories per shake is a bit much for me though lol. NOT a fan of their lemonade....unless you just happen to like super watered down lemonade, then it's perfect. The decor and ambience was great...just wish that there was more guidance on how to get to the restaurant since it's within the Venetian....which is huge.....it's near/next to the poker room. Parking is free! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a very fun and enjoyable experience.  Me, my wife and my brother took my mom there for Mother's Day.  Try to give her something completely different for dinner.  Great vibes, even better music and the service was on point.  At the end we all got those huge shakes to top the night off.  We all had a great time.  The only down fall to me was the place was a little too pricey for burgers, fries and shakes.  That being said I would definitely go back again cause the experience was a GREAT ONE!!!"}
{"text":"QUICK & DIRTY: When compared to other casual-fun dining options on The Strip, this New York-based chain deserves a glance. (At least for you to check out their outta control, Instagram-worthy, and NSFW milkshakes.)  Things to know: ***** I. LOCATION: Black Tap resides on the first floor of The Venetian, next to their gondola rides, and fifty feet or so from the resort's main poker room. Just hug the rim of the first floor until you get there. (That's what she said.)   II. FOOD & DRINK: Again, people know of them because of their decadent milkshakes. I, unfortunately, couldn't indulge (because I didn't want to pass gas at a strip club and beach season looms ahead), but I opted for The Old Fashioned (burger) and onion rings and fries.   *The Old Fashioned ($18): They top the prime burger with crimini mushrooms, swiss, caramelized onions, and horseradish sauce cooked rare. The swiss, onions, and mushrooms enhanced the umami-ness of the beef, and the horseradish gave a nice kick. They offered a generous portion, too.   My bottom bun, though, soaked up all the juices and was soggy. So I thought they could've seared the burger better to keep in the flavors.   *Fries ($8): Seasoned well, but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't order them again.  *Onion Rings ($7): Gigantic, yet a bit too oily. I'd suggest these over their fries, though.  III. SERVICE: Fast (only took 15 minutes for my burger and sides) and friendly. No problems there.  IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: It's hip and unapologetically brash (good thing). I dug how they played East Coast 90's hip-hop above. That's wassup.   V. PRICES: You won't find a good deal there -- since it resides on The Strip -- but it is comparable (regarding cost) to the other food stalls and restaurants in the area. Therefore, Black Tap offers better value.  VI. OVERALL: I'd def try Black Tap again. One of the better options, for food on The Strip and a solid choice if you're staying at The Venetian."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I will definitely be back to try all of the milk shake flavors!! You get so much more than expected."}
{"text":"My oh my where to start?!? This place is amazing! I was skeptical due to all the hype, I thought it might be one of those overpriced burger joints with a popular name and fancy shakes that weren't that great...I couldn't have been more wrong!   We arrived at 5:30pm on a Wednesday and they were already fairly busy. We were seated in about 10 minutes and our waitress Bailey promptly arrived to take our order. Bailey was so friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive; she was fantastic! While waiting for our order we were lucky enough to be able to see all the crazy shakes being made, and holy smokes those things are massive and look delicious! They were expertly crafted and each one looked beautifully enticing in its own sinfully sweet way. The food going by all looked great as well. It didn't take long before our food arrived, and it was all perfection. We got the crispy brussel sprouts with tahini (I'm not a tahini fan, but this was good), a burger salad, and two American burgers (one with an egg) with fries. The sprouts were to die for; they melted in your mouth. The burgers and burger salad were cooked just right and were incredibly juicy (We eat burgers all the time and this is in our top 5 for sure) The fries were good and plentiful, and the sauces (chipotle mayo and buttermilk dill) complimented them well. After enjoying each dish it made us want to try the entire menu!   My only knocks on black tap is that it is very loud and not necessarily a good place to chat, the bathrooms are unisex (which can be gross for a lady such as myself who walks in to a toilet seat left up), and the napkins are flimsy paper that require you to use 10 or more with your burger. Those are all easily overlooked since the overall experience is pretty grand. The staff is efficient and friendly, environment fun, food stupendous, and prices somewhat reasonably for Vegas. Next time I go I might have to try one of those crazy shakes. I definitely recommend black tap!"}
{"text":"These shakes are not only fun looking...but very tasty too! I visited with a party of four a Saturday around 9:30 pm and was immediately seated. We visited with the plan to only have the shakes since we already had dinner.   I ordered the cookies and cream milkshake and shared it with the hubby. The shakes are big enough to be shared with multiple people. The rim of the glass was covered with vanilla frosting and oreo crumbs. The milkshake also came with a big cookie ice cream and a tower of whipped cream and cookie crumbs.   Needless to say the shake was pretty amazing. It cost $15 for the big elaborate ones and $9 for the simpler ones. I think that if you are planning to share it the $15 shake is more than enough and fairly priced.   This is a place I intend to come back to!"}
{"text":"\"That Shake Cray...\"  No surprise I had to try this informal 90's hip hop vibes restaurant for lunch after numerous Facebook ads!   The tables are pretty close together so I opted for a seat at the bar for extra elbow space. The playlist is epic! You can't help but rock out to some Biz Markie, Nas etc.   Vegan Black Bean Burger $16 was a lot better than I anticipated and I'm grateful restaurants are more accommodating!   Cookies & Cream Supreme Shake $15 This playful shake is overdressed with whip cream and the remainder of the glass is a \"liquid like\" consistency! The overall taste was okay but the crushed Oreos around the glass taste like refrigeration. This shake has potential but definitely needs some work!! (Holsteins shakes at The Cosmo are by far one of the best shakes on the strip!)"}
{"text":"Didn't think these couldn't be as good as they looked but SURPRISE they were! Sat outside with a beautiful view, the server was sweet, and the shake was sweeter!"}
{"text":"The service was great but  $30 for a burger and shake that needed a lot of love is a disappointment! They do give you a lot of fries, loads of it.  We had fried pickles too which were too hard to bite, burgers were blah then we had to see the hype about their crazy shakes, we had the cotton candy, Bam Bam and dark cherry shake and all the flavors were all very weak, it was blah.  If you want great delicious burgers and shakes or smoothies, run away from this place and take your appetite to LVB Burger, inside Mirage. Everything on the menu is delish!!! The fried pickles, guacamole egg roll things, mango mojito and the s'mores shake are all addicting!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  Old school hip-hop themed interior.  Real cool and hip vibe. A little noisy, but not unbearable.  We had 2 servers. It wasn't a busy night, but it took forever for us to get an order in.  We ordered burgers and asked for medium rare.  At some points, it WAS medium rare.  But at other points, it was all sorts of styles.  It was like the Earth(I do mean the planet).  The outside was well-done, but at its core, it was rare as all hell. It was not worth the 20$  My girlfriend loved the blue cheese on mine, but after awhile, I got tired of it.  The milkshakes are ALL hype.  Honestly, the strawberry shake tasted like something from in-n-out. I wish it was made with actually cotton candy ice cream. To be a real cotton candy milkshake. It was a strawberry milkshake topped with some cotton candy.  And at one point, it felt like we weren't going to be able to order a milkshake. Our waiter told us the machine broke.  The only 'wow' factor of it was the outside part."}
{"text":"Insanely busy last night but service was still on point. Food came out fast and the recommendations from the server were so delicious. Definitely worth the price! Thought the milkshakes would be mediocre as I assumed it was just made for presentation but the shakes were awesome. Can't get enough of the cotton candy. Definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Came here solely for their out of this world crazy milkshakes. I've been seeing buzzfeed videos of their milkshakes from their New York location for a while so was stoked when they opened in Vegas.   The shakes are big, definitely 2-4 people can share one. Their most popular is the Oreo one but our server liked the sweet and salty one the most ( peanut butter based). I got the cookie shake and my friend got the cake shake. Both did not disappoint.  The actual piece of cake on the cake shake was very moist and delicious. It fell off quickly and was a little messy to eat but definitely enjoyable.   My cookie shake was also very good. It had a lot of chocolate chips which is not really my jam. I did enjoy everything else though.   The shakes were a little runny. I wish it had a thicker consistency.  Other than that the shakes were fun to snap, instagram and eat!"}
{"text":"I took my sister out for dinner. We shared an American burger. For dessert we had the cake batter shake. Definitely shareable portion. Our tab was $35. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have been bombarded by ads from black tap and went there for the over the top shakes.  We got a sweet and salt shake a cake shake and another one plus a $22 hamburger for the son. The burger must have been good since it disappeared before anyone could notice.  The shakes were good but the frosting cake and candy made the shakes appealing.  I do not know if it was worth the price to do twice but it was worth a one time deal on vacation.   Worth the cause to get off the bucket list"}
{"text":"What a great find! Quickly seated with our reservation on a Monday night.  Ordered their mule and it was delicious! Fresh ginger flavor that wasn't too sweet. All people in our party loved their entrees but the quinoa salad definitely stuck out as a highlight for the otherwise meat eaters. Great feedback on the veggie burger & California burger as well. Service was on point - attentive, knowledgeable and quick.   Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I came here and just ordered a milkshake. It was the birthday cake one, there was literally a piece of cake on top the shake which was super cool! But very hard to eat without an extra plate.   I thought the food was really over priced based on what my friends ordered, they said they're burgers were good but not amazing. I also thought the milkshake was overpriced too but I get it, they're extravagant and known for that I think.   And thennnnn our server barely tended to us and also didn't give us a palazzo employee discount when we told her we worked in the hotel. It was extremely hard to get a hold of her when we needed to. Fyi- there's added gratuity for groups of 6 or larger.   Basically, I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Do you want delicious burgers AND AWESOME shakes? Well look no further! Black Tap is the place to go! I'm a big burger fan and try to burgers at as many place as I can as I search for the best burger in the world and Black Tap made into my my top three. The California burger they had with avocado was really good, better than I expected. Then come the shakes, the ginormous shakes. If you're out on a date, you probably should share one because those things will fill you up. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has insane milkshake concoctions! I bookmarked this place for some time now and I'm glad I can now say that I've finally been here. My friend was in town this weekend and we decided to come here tonight for dinner. We were immediately greeted by the friendly hostess who seated us with no wait at all. Once we sat down, our waiter came by to introduce himself and even gave us some tips on his favorite items off the menu. Upon his recommendations, we ended up ordering the truffle burger with sweet potato fries and the crispy chicken sandwich (with a kbbq sauce) with fries. We even asked the waiter if he could cut it in half for us so we could try both. He was more than happy to do it for us. Both burgers were delicious. The fries were really good too. For dessert, we ordered the cookie shake and loved it. I'm so glad we split the shake because it was so filling but good.   The only disadvantage about this place is that the burgers and shakes are pretty pricey. We were surprised that we got charged a dollar each for bbq and ranch sauce. But then again, it's expected since this place is located on the strip.   As a local here, this place is a great spot to take friends and family who are visiting LV. This place has great food and excellent customer service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG. Where do I start? I discovered this place on Instagram, where I saw their crazy milkshakes and I just had to try one. The Crazyshakes are $15 but are well worth it. I tried their Cake Batter Crazyshake, which was AWESOME. It's a cake batter milkshake with clumps of actual cake batter inside it, decorated with a thick rainbow sprinkle rim, an actual slice of cake on top, also topped with icing, whipped cream, and a cherry. The service was great as well. I only stopped in for dessert, but from what I saw on the other customers' tables, I am definitely coming back for food and another milkshake."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, and good beer! Rachel is spot on with the recommendations. Just don't order the water (it's fine, but with all the other beverage offerings you'd be a fool)."}
{"text":"Wow! My disappointment was not leaving room for the amazing ice cream that I saw others happily eating. If I had a do-over I would forego the app (fried pickles, not that great) and split a burger, which would have left room for ice cream. Yeah for a well done burger without having to ask twice!  Service was a little distracted."}
{"text":"Isn't worth it overpriced and seem like poor quality all around. Shakes look amazing but it stops there."}
{"text":"We were looking around for a place to eat our first night in Vegas and came upon this place. We like beer and so figured hey, lets celebrate being here have a drink and some food. Their food was soo good and were big portions, I got the California Burger but with a beef patty instead of chicken and it was soo delicious. They had a good beer selection too and the dessert space in the middle of the restaurant looked fabulous with their creations. If we weren't stuffed, we would have tried one."}
{"text":"Black top is on top! Their milkshakes are absolutely AMAZING!!!  The milkshakes will spark conversations Beyond this world. Before you can dive in and begin drinking your milkshake you first must eat your way from the outer portion of the milkshake from all of the toppings and candies glued and stuck to the outside of the ice cream Tang makes getting to the center of the milkshake even that much more enjoyable. Most people will wait to grab a milkshake as their dessert but my suggestion is that you grab the milkshakes first in order to enjoy it throughout your visit because it will take you that long to get it completed. Now the milkshake Shirley aim to please however their burgers are great too. Their burgers are cooked as requested and with tons of flavor however if a hamburger is at your thing they do have great salads listed on the menu for you to try to which come in a very generous size as well. However, upon my return I will definitely be back for their milkshakes again because they were that great. That's known for their drinks and their milkshakes"}
{"text":"Black Tap is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas Strip. For tourists, this should be your first stop for two reasons: 1) iconic milkshakes 2) perfect views of the outdoor gondola rides. For locals, the CrazyShakes are definitely worth the trip to the Strip.   Black Tap serves up the most imaginative shakes in all of Las Vegas. I know this because I've tried them all: Holsteins, Shake Shack, Flippin' Good Burgers, and Steak n Shake - just to name a few. I wanted to be a little adventurous, so here's what CrazyShakes we ordered:   Bam Bam (A) Fruity Pebbles Shake with Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispy Treats, Laffy Taffy, and a strawberry PopTart   Sweet n Salty (B+) Peanut Butter shake, chocolate-peanut butter rimmed with M&Ms, mini PB cups, and a pretzel rod drizzled in chocolate  Cookies and Cream Supreme (A+) Oreo Shake vanilla frosted rimmed with crushed Oreos, topped with a 'cookies 'n cream' ice cream sandwich, and crumbled Oreos  The servers are all extremely friendly and attentive.  And be sure to request a seat on their patio (unless it's during summer months)."}
{"text":"Loved our hamburger which very juicy and flavorful, the atmosphere was awesome as well. Will definitely go back in September! The shakes looked amazing but we were full from the hamburgers. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Food was good! Little pricey...but....it's on the strip. What do you expect? BBQ burger and fries was good. Their crazy shakes are fun! Ambiance is cool, service was good. If you go on the earlier side of the evening you won't experience a wait to be seated. Fun experience!"}
{"text":"My Oreo Shake was yummy. We also had fried pickles which were good. I'd recommend a little more sauce for the pickles. Texas burger was good. Nice atmosphere and music. My only two hang ups were the size of the 4 top booths. I think the tables could be a little longer and the booths a tad wider. And the water glasses are so tiny. I get that it's to probably encourage people to buy beverages but they're like shot glasses. But overall good place."}
{"text":"The hype is definitely the shakes. I give it a three only because our server Alyssa wasn't very attentive. We (party of 6) work inside the Venetian and asked our server for employee discount once our check came and asked that we needed our badge. We randomly came in to try it out so didn't have our badges with us . We had our work schedules on our phone and paycom for proof but didn't seem interested to check it out.  Will we be returning ? Probably not.  We work in the industry and provide excellent guest service to Venetian guests and employees. I don't see why we're being treated so differently here. Especially for being Venetian employees."}
{"text":"Excellent food, selection, and most importantly, the service. As a local, who works on the Strip, there's only a few places I'm willing to come visit on my night off, and Black Tap is one of them. Sat at the bar on Saturday night, Leo, did an amazing job from beginning to end. Let me sample a couple of stouts to make sure I was happy with my choice, and made some great recommendations. My wife had a crazy shake, I had the Fried Mozz, wings, and some beers. Can't wait to come back and grab a burger. Thanks again, Leo."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to give this place a try. We had a party of 6 and was about a 25 min wait on a Saturday evening (9:30pm). I ordered the Californian burger ($17) and a passionfruit lemonade ($5). If you aren't a big truffle fan, I would opt for the truffle mayo to be on the side. It's very strong!! My turkey patty was a little on the dry side, but with the guac tomato lettuce it was bearable.  I mixed in some chipotle mayo with my truffle mayo together and it tasted great! Like my friend had mentioned the fries were perfectly seasoned, our table was not given any ketchup, and forks were not replenished at our table.  Water was served luke warm, eww! I ordered a passionfruit lemonade to try instead of a shake which I regret now. I'd much rather spend an extra $4 on a classic shake or the extra $10 on the crazy shake due to the portion you get. My lemonade was mediocre and there was no refills available on it. The size of the lemonade was probably about an 8 oz size at most, only slightly larger than the mason jars for water. My boyfriend had ordered the Mexico City burger and felt it was a disappointment as it was lacking the Mexico City flavor... i.e. he felt that it should have included guac. Feel free to had a small spoonful of guac for $2. That's how much my Californian came with.   Our server was missing during most of our meal as well and for the price of the burgers, I expected more that's why I would rate this place at 3.5 stars.    The decor is pretty hip here, if I were to come back I'd like to try their drinks and shakes. A good place to have a quick bite and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"So I arranged a date for my husband and I, to The Void Star Wars VR experience then to The Black Tap Tavern for lunch (he must've asked me 1,000 times \"where's that place with the awesome milkshakes?\"). I got the Bam Bam Shake (aka Fruity Pebbles shake), Doug went with the Brooklyn Blackout (all chocolate). We also got burgers which we both agreed afterward we should've just split a burger. The shakes were so yummy, it's all about the shakes here, if you don't leave that place with a smile on your face after having one of their shakes, then you are lame. The burgers are just ok, they were good but nothing special, same with the fries. Everything is pricey but that's life on The Strip. Staff was great. Loved the Old School Hip Hop vibe. I'd for sure go back for a shake."}
{"text":"Home of the crazy shakes! I ordered the Bam Bam shake - fruity pebbles shake covered in whipped cream and fruity pebbles, vanilla frosted rim with more fruity pebbles, a strawberry laffy taffy rope, half a strawberry Poptart, rice Krispy treat and cherry on top. Burger was really good but fries were average at best. Honestly, the best BEST part of dining at this location is the staff. It was a super busy night but we got seated at the bar almost right away. The servers behind the bar were absolutely amazing and so attentive. The atmosphere and vibe were also super fun, and it was a blast to see all the different crazy shakes come out and everyone's expressions when they saw their sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food but I tried the sweet and salty crazy milkshake that they are famous for and it was probably the worst milkshake I ever had. I waited 15 minutes for them to make the shake and when it got to me it was already melting. The presentation looked nice (aside from the melting ice cream dripping off the cup) but the way it's assembled makes it impossible to eat. Half the shake was whipped cream, the other half was a mixture of peanut butter cups, m&ms, PB chocolate pretzels, a completely frozen and inedible lady taffy (with the wrapper still on) and completely melted ice cream. Any child can go to the supermarket, buy these ingredients and make it themselves in a matter of minutes. If they charged $5 for this milkshake like most places do I still think it's amongst the worst I've had but I wouldn't complain. The only positive thing I have to say is the customer service was very good and they didn't charge me for it. The food did look good though. That said, If you want shakes go to Holsteins"}
{"text":"Damn this place is hella good.   I had the Mexico City burger with pickled jalapeño. What I expected was the pickled peppers you get at the burrito shop, but these are done in house and go very well with the cilantro garnish.   Additional appeal for having a GREAT playlist going and decor/ambiance is top notch and far out hip.   At first glance you won't notice the patio (very chill) with shuffleboard and view (but not too close) of the strip, but that's an option.   Great food = A  Well appointed style = A+  Black tap is killer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night around 8pm and was seated right away in the front of the restaurant by the bar and milkshake bar.  I wasn't crazy about how close the tables were to each other and how the booth to my left had a seat facing our table, but at least we were seated immediately.  During our meal, great old-school hip hop was playing in the background, so that was another plus.  And something to note, a jar with utensils are on each table as well as thin napkins in a holder, which were hard to pull out.  I had to come here and get one of their Crazy Shakes, and it was recommended by our server to order it and have it served before the meal so as not to get too full for it.  I got the Cake Shake which was very good.  We put the the cake that was on top of the shake on a plate and ate it separately.  It was moist, very sweet, and pretty tasty.  The shake was tasty as well, and very thick when it was first brought out which is just how I like it.  It is definitely something that can be shared with another person portion-wise.  To eat I got the All-American burger with bacon added to it, and it came with the veggies and top bun on the side of the plate.  It wasn't the best burger I've had, but still pretty good, though I feel like bacon makes everything taste better :p  I substituted the fries for onion rings which were heavier on onion than on the batter, when I actually prefer it the other way around.  Definitely a place worth checking out if for the milkshakes alone :p  Not only Instagram-worthy but yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Was heading there for my wifes Bday, called 2 days in advance to reserve a party of 12.  Didnt take reservations. Okay.  Day of dinner.  Wifes mom went in 30 minutes early, 3 very rude, very \"who gives a f*ck\" hostess, said naw, everyone has to be here.  So we have drinks at the bar, 30 minutes later 11 out of 12 are here, the 12 is walking the casino trying to find the place.  I tell the 3 hostess, (who are busy gossiping) we have 11 out of 12, the 12 is literally 2 minutes away walking.  AGAIN, while obviously annoyed, tell us when she gets here. IT IS 8:00PM WED prime time dinner in a nice casino.  Last friend gets here, i tell her WE ARE ALL HERE.  She seems annoyed and scrambling around looking for tables.  Another 10 minutes.  Finally get going, takes us to 3 BOOTHS, she like, \"sorry, its all we got open.\"  So after multiple attempts to let them know ahead they still dont give 2 sh*ts.  My friend sees AN OPEN SIDE ROOM SPECIFICALLY FOR LARGE PARTIES being cleared.  Asked the waitress, can we sit in here?  \"NO THATS CLOSED NOW\".  so we are sitting around for another 10 or 15 minutes deciding if its even worth it with this incredibly rude hostessez and waitress, when the GM, John steps in.  We ask him why we cant be moved, he said \"No problem!\"  Literally saved the day.  Brought in a different server, missed hiz name but buff white guy,  super nice, friendly, professional and efficient.     Food is great, shakes are awesome. Service was fast and great.  John the manager checked in often, even offered to cut our bday cake for us!  He was incredible.  Made what originally was a horrible experience amazing.  The hostesses up front are rude, patronizing and more interested in gossiping instead of customers, the waitress who told us basically to screw off and not bother her with a large birthday party sucked, and need ti be retrained.   But manager John and the fit white waiter was amazing and really exemplified customer service and great experience.  If your going for a quick bite, sure, but if your a large party wanting to celebrate there, FORGET IT.    *side note, 9 out of 12 all work in the service industry. We arent that picky and understand busy nights, but this was ridicous."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and Awesome atmosphere!! I got the Cake Shake and was in heaven!! Would definitely recommend checking it out!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to bring my daughters to eat at this place the environment looks fun but the food it's horrible tho the shakes are pretty good, and customer service is horrible my daughter order a pizza burger she had took two bites and she hated it , we asked the waitress if she could please give us a different plate or different food and she asked her manager and she said the manager refused to do so, we have never been told that before which is it was very weird,  the restaurant manager will not even come out and ask us how was her food or any concern towards it, to me that speaks horrible customer service. my daughter was very upset that I had asked but I thought it was only fair that if we spend that much money, we will have one meal be replaced. And they didn't , not only that but the food taste quality was very unflavor Not best burgers for sure, if anything try the Sugar Factory there Amazing from there food and deserts and for sure customers Service and you will not feel like you just spend your money and not had a good experience. Oh and we still tip 20%  not going back here again"}
{"text":"Friend and I went here for lunch. We both had burgers and we loved them. We came for their crazy looking shakes, they were equally satisfying."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday around 5pm with a party of 6 and we were seated right away. We heard that this place just opened and no way were we going to try to go here on a weekend. I was happily surprised there was no wait. NOTE! They will not seat you unless your full party is there.  That atmosphere is great and the wait staff is friendly. I really loved  and the music they played. I saw a DJ booth, so I'm assuming they have a live DJ on the weekends/nights. Regardless of no live DJ the music was amazing, it was old school hip hop and pop.   Now to the food, I ordered the Crispy Brussel sprouts and Truffle burger with egg. Don't like Brussel sprouts? Order these and you will,  they are delicious, believe me you will thank me. I liked the Brussel sprouts more than I liked my milkshake and my milkshake was DELICIOUS. I ordered the Sour Power shake. And, sour power it was. First my shake was sour, then it was sweet. Or wait, I think that was just the sour patch kids that were on the side o my glass. Along with sour patch kids, I also enjoyed a lollipop and a pixy stick with my shake. Presentation was amazing, and black cherry ice cream melted into a perfectly thick milkshake. My burger was good, but is it really hard to ruin a burger? Nope.   5 stars, no wait, good food and great music! If this wasn't on the strip I would come here often."}
{"text":"Only came here because my wife went to the one in NYC, went there for the shakes and it was amazing, it has a nice view of the front of the Venetian and the Gondolas, and shakes were awesome."}
{"text":"Beer, Burgers, and Shakes - what a combination!!!  We loved eating here, what fun!  Big selection of beers, great burgers, and the shakes are insane.  Went twice.  Everyone loved it from the 10 year olds to the 75 year olds."}
{"text":"I came for the milkshakes because they looked amazing online. The Oreo milkshake was AWESOME! You have to spilt this with someone. It is huge and pricey!!! The only downfall is that the restaurant is in the middle of the casino and smells like smoke!! I would not be able to actually eat there due to the smell of smoke!"}
{"text":"Really good is burgers...cool vibe.  Also ridiculous millshakes!!  Pretty much on par price wise with other Strip burger joints.  We waited about 30 min for a table on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Scored some seats at the bar and were served promptly.  Decided on some Korean wings as an app and they were very good.  My man got the basic burger and I chose the one with mushrooms and horseradish. My burger was tasty. The basic burger was lacking flavor. I upgraded my side to homemade onion rings. Well, when we received them, they were cold and soggy. The bartender happily got us some fresh, hot rings. They are breaded in a light flour, but they aren't as crunchy as they should be. Maybe they need a cornstarch or rice flour dusting instead.  In all, we were a bit underwhelmed with our visit here. We've had better burgers, fries, and o-rings elsewhere. I should have just had a giant milkshake and appetizer."}
{"text":"We went to try this place because we wanted to go somewhere  different. So me and my friends went and it was right on the strip .So we get there and they say there is a waiting time and then we we're seated immediately and then we decided to sit outside and since it was on the strip we had a great view. We all ordered something small so there was chili and a cesar salad and queso  dip with chips all of these was a really good price .If you like big milkshakes then this is the right place for you . I ordered the cookies and creme  milkshake and it came with a giant oreo ice cream cookie . It was so delicious. The queso dip was one of the best dips I have ever had they give you a lot of chips . I would definitely  go back and take more of my friends you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All I heard is about these crazy milkshakes that this place has so I figured I need to get down here to check it out. I had a buddy in town so I throttled would be the perfect time.  We went in it was around 10:30pm on a Friday place was busy but not overly crowded, so we sat at the bar. Waited for about 5 min before the bartender came over with her miserable look on her face to start us off with water and then walk away. Unfortunately it wasn't the way my buddy wanted to start his trip to Vegas so we left. I've talked to others with the same experience so obviously they need to change something. Let me know when it's fixed so we can try one of those amazing looking shakes."}
{"text":"Love this place! The salad is pretty large and the milkshakes are really good. Me and my friends tried three different milkshakes collectively and they were all great. Fun place to go to on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff is also extremely nice."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to the birthday cake shake for months! The pictures and descriptions from other yelpers had my mouth watering. I could not wait!  We arrived around 9pm on Sunday. The line for a table was long so we sat at the bar. The bar staff was amazing. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered the cake shake.  Ice cream +cake. What could be better? I have a huge sweet tooth and that combination is my favorite. And then I saw it. The shake matched every picture description I read from other yelpers. It was almost  as if slow motion had taken over. It was placed in front of me and the heavens opened.   I took my first sip of the shake. Hmm. Not what I thought. I'll try another. Nope. Still a strange flavor and temperature combo. It was thick like a milk shake but it wasn't cold. It was room temperature.  I kept sipping because I didn't get cake batter flavor. After 6 or 7 taste tests, I gave up and moved onto the cake.   I love cake! Add sprinkles and it's a party! I pushed my spoon through the layers and ... my spoon got stuck. The middle layer of icing was too cold to get through. Nearly frozen. I gave it a minute to come to room temperature and took a few bites. The actual cake was delicious. The icing to cake ratio was 4:1. Too much for me.   The combination of room temperature, non flavored shake and nearly frozen cake was a huge disappointment. Sadly, I'll  stick with shake shack and no cake"}
{"text":"Overpriced shakes thats filled with store bought goodies? I only came here just to try the shakes and i think its very hyped. I ordered the fruity pebbles shake and it almost tasted like the froot loops shake from burger king. I also ordered their michelada. It came with high miller lite and it was very watered down. I believe i will come back just to try their burgers next time but not the shakes. Service was good with no complaints. I would give this place another try just to try the food."}
{"text":"They totally messed up my order and the burger was such a nasty mess I had to send it back.  I never send food back.  Literally only a hand full of times in my life."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger and service. Four of the beers that we wanted to try we're not available. Excuse was that they were busy. Guess what? You're a super hyped burger bar in Vegas...you're always going to to be busy...account for it. My buddy had just recently eaten at the BT in NY and said that location was FAR better than the LV location."}
{"text":"I loved the aesthetically pleasing, pixie lit porch and the great views from the strip-side restaurant. Great environment. I wish the misters would have reached all the way to our table though. It was nice and steamy even at 9oclock!  The food and drinks were amazing with traditional options along with semi adventurous, unique items too. High class and tastey. Pricy, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm not so sure what the excitement is about this place. The drinks aren't that exciting the food wasn't that good.  We came in for appetizers and wanted to try the very expensive milk shakes. They are so pretty to Look at and the brownies are good but the shake itself wasn't anything special. I've actually have had better shakes.   The waiter was very nice but we ran out of water (with no ice ever) and never got anymore. It was hella hot where they seated us. In this side room. I asked if they could turn air on or something but they didn't and it was hot the entire time we were there.  I really wanted to give his place 5 stars. It just not worth it and it's really dirty."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries were top notch and the shake as promised was Vegas style and \"over the top\"!  All in all yes it's pricey but worth the trip!  The service was great as well and yes water cups are small."}
{"text":"The vibe is 80's rock. When you step inside, you're surrounded by fluorescent lights and awesome artwork. The space is bigger than expected.   The menu is huge - be prepared to make some decisions. There are six different specialty shakes. We got the Cookie Shake - it was HUGE but delicious. The frosting flavors mingle nicely with the chocolate chip cookie and handspun ice cream flavors. Don't be overwhelmed when you see it - it's worth it.   We ordered the Greg Norman and the Crispy Chicken. The crispy chicken was the highlight of the meal (after the shake). It's soft and juicy yet crispy. The salad/pickle on top is fresh and crunchy. And the sauce is impeccable. We were not impressed with the Greg Norman despite the wagu - it was over cooked and charred.   Definitely will be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"The Food is amazing price is great, and the Shakes are great. I Would really recommend this place for a date night"}
{"text":"This service is so bad here.  We were so offended that we left before we could dine.   You would think this was the IT place in town. 2 pm on a Thursday. Nobody in the place but a team at the door basically turning people away. How do you spell attitude!!  We asked to speak to a manager and were refused!!! If they treat you this badly in live - I fear how bad the service is!!! Go to yard bird - service- food - they know how to do it!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK. The chips and guacamole were disappointing as it seems that there is vinegar added to it. Runny and the vinegar overpowered the guacamole. The burger that we ordered was very good. The turkey burger was extremely disappointing. Nowhere on the menu was it mentioned that it was cooked with Mauracian spices. Not sure of the spelling, but I would suggest that management update the menu to advise people of this. Had to work very hard to suppress that taste. Will not return..."}
{"text":"We ordered a old fashioned burger, six piece of chicken wing and a milk shake. I would give 5 star for the burger but everything else was really below the expectation. Too salty or too sweet."}
{"text":"From the first time I saw pictures of the sundae creations on Facebook, I knew I had to get to Black Tap and see it for myself. I made the short trip from LA to LV and connected with girlfriends for our foodie fun, cuz that's what we like to do.    My first impression of Black Tap was not exactly what I was expecting. That being said, I should have kept an open mind.  The restaurant was far more upscale than I thought it would be, but definitely casual and easy going with a modern decor perfect for burgers and beer.  I guess I pictured it to look like a 1950's style malt shop based on the incredible sundaes. Glad I was wrong.  The host was very nice and I think he could see we were excited to be there. He sat us in a very cool booth where we had a great view of the the sundae preparation and all the candy on display.   I can't say enough about our server, Carlos.  He was very friendly and helpful when we had lots of menu questions.   Two of us shared a Texan Burger and onion rings. The burger was scrumptious and was generous in size, so perfect to split. I appreciated that it was divided in half in the kitchen at no extra cost.  My other friend ordered a side Greek salad and crispy Brussels sprouts for the table. I think the portions were very nice and we were all satisfied with our meal. Of course, we left room for that much anticipated dessert.  After much deliberation, I decided to get the Cake Shake.  Yep, it's a vanilla cake batter shake topped with a huge piece of white cake and sprinkles everywhere!    We had a terrific time, sharing dinner and dessert.  This will not only be a great memory, but I plan to make it a tradition every time I go to Vegas.  By the way, my girlfriend who lives in Vegas is also a chef and culinary instructor and she raved about the burger, and I think that says 5 stars!  Linda R."}
{"text":"All the excitement to visit this place for nothing! Two thumbs down to their hostess and customer service skills, We stayed at Venetian for my daughters 23rd Bday late January. We were a group of  10 7 adults 2 teenagers and a baby. When we approached the hostess to request a table, she was very short tempered and said wait time would be close to 30 minutes. Mind your there was no one else waiting and counter seating as well as bar seating available. We asked if we could be split between those two areas. She said she would ask, meanwhile she asked that we \"all move aside as a group of 4  walked in and she tried to accommodate them\" I immediately told her We are customers too and if you don't' have room for us then we can go elsewhere. Shortly after she got my husbands attention and magically found two table for us just a few minutes later.  I know is Vegas, but this Food is waaay too overpriced and milkshakes look messy life compared to their ads. Oh and Be ready to drop a $40 tip for their terrible service. Never again! #fail"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place after seeing their insane milkshake creations on Instagram. I went with a friend and when we walked up we were seated immediately. The hostess was very nice and put us in a cute booth. The milkshake menu had a lot of choices but we ended up with the cotton candy shake and ordered some fries to go with it. We chose the Korean BBQ sauce with the fries. It was ok but not great to dip fries in, we should have stuck with ranch. The milkshake came out very quickly. We were also seated next to where they make them and it was fun to watch. It tasted great and was relatively large so we were glad to share it. I will return to try the other flavors for sure!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food for the price that it was! Sangria was 15 bucks which was okay. I had the burger salad, but the burger was a little too salty for my liking. Also had the bam bam shake which was literally vanilla ice cream blended with fruity pebbles. Nothing that great!! We went for my birthday and all the waiter said was happy birthday. Don't go to get special treatment that's for sure. Also the seats are uncomfortable and the service isn't that speedy."}
{"text":"Amazing service at the bar! Been to the one in NYC and this is just as great! I THINK this was opening weekend? Not sure but it seemed like it! Multiple bartenders came over to see if we were all set multiple times during our meal and dessert. It was nice to actually be served at a bar and not wait! Our meal was served super fast and our shakes were amazing! They have a \"wow factor\" look but just as importantly they actually taste good too. Shout out to the amazing service and food. Had to knock off a star because my friend asked for a beer on their menu that they said they didn't have, then asked for another on the menu which they also didn't have, then asked for a coffee milkshake, also on the menu, also not available. Kind of weird but again, great food and great service :)"}
{"text":"Fun place from nyc   Been waiting for them to arrive in Las Vegas.  The shakes and burgers are very good.  Overall a really good experience that will definitely get better.  The Texan burger was terrific.  Juicy and flavorful.  Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.  Looking forward to going back. Sent some colleagues over before a show. They had to get the shakes to go. They said even deconstructed it was delicious"}
{"text":"The staff were all very friendly and accommodating! We loved this place and all we got was dessert....but let me just say I've been dreaming of that dessert ever since we left! It was amazing! We got the Chocolate Blackout shake, but we got it with vanilla milk shake instead of chocolate. Super yummy!  UPDATE- we went back for a second shake and one of the burger salads....sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"The service sucked, food was alright & the shake was good... Staff was unprofessional (petty attitude over splitting a check). THE RANCH DIP IS NOT RANCH!!!!!! It tastes like tartar sauce.  the burger was good but bun was soaked in grease. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else, then go here for their shakes. That's the only thing worth it. $15 per shake."}
{"text":"Burgers are super delicious but not worth $16. Shakes are ok, same as red robin just more junk on it so not worth $16 to $18. 2 burgers and 2 shakes cost me $79. Not going back  and definitely no server attention. Everyone playing around and on their phones. Server screwed up our order. I should've never tipped."}
{"text":"Good drinks and food. I had the burger salad which was great and my daughter enjoyed the crispy chicken Caesar salad which she also liked. The crazy shakes were pretty awesome and the kids loved them!  The food came fairly quickly which was good after waiting close to an hour. It is a little pricey for the food in my opinion. One shake and two salads was $60. All in all it was good but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Some people find the crazy shake price of $12-$15 spendy, but it feeds at least 2-3 people if you share it, so it's not so bad. I absolutely LOVE the Korean BBQ Chicken Sandwich--it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had. EVER!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night, was seated right away. They don't take reservations, so first come first serve. Our waiter was awesome and very friendly, as well as the other staff members. We came for the milkshakes but decided to share an All American Cheese Burger with regular fries. The burger was cooked well and was juicy. Then we got the Cookies and Cream shake and the Confetti Cake Shake. Both amazing. I did end up liking the cookies and cream more because the cake was alittle too sweet for me but the presentation was A+! Be mindful the place isn't that big. You can sit at the bar or in the booths. However they have an outside area that overlooks the strip and the gondola rides. Which opens in the next few weeks for more space and entertainment. Overall we had fun and enjoyed watching what everyone else ordered."}
{"text":"My salad was a 5 Star (Waygu salad... yum!) but here's where this restaurant lost points with me:  You can only order your meats Medium OR Well Done. I like mine well done so it's okay but the rest of my family was disappointed.  The bathroom was very untidy and looked like it hadn't been serviced in awhile. Restaurant wasn't busy (we didn't have to wait for a table) so I feel like they should've been more on top of this.  The crazy shakes (a main draw for them) are served on a tiny little plate and everything kept falling off the sides and hitting the table... gross! EVERYONE around us was experiencing this... Just serve it on a bigger plate, duh! Our server: didn't bring refills on water or iced tea unless you asked for it... which we had to keep doing! You'd think she would've gotten a clue eventually to keep an eye out for that but no:( She didn't clear away the empty plates as we finished and generally she had no personality.  Not sure I'd go back for the $15 milkshake and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! That's all I can say !!!!! My husband and I use to love burger bar but burger bar what ??! Forget that place these are the best burgers ever !!!! And may I say leo is the best bartender ever !!!!! If I can give this place a ten I would !!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my friends and I wanted to stop by this place since we heard great things! We stayed in Vegas for my 21st (it was on Saturday!) and before leaving today we wanted black tap for my last dinner.  My friend and I split a Texan burger, which was okay, not that flavorful or anything, but my other friends got old fashioned, the truffle burger, and another Texan and they seemed pretty okay with theirs. Nothing spectacular (which honestly was kinda disappointing!)   We also ordered ranch but apparently sauce costs extra and we didn't know until we got the bill. We told our server that we didn't know it was extra for sauce and said that he should've told us before hand it cost extra for it, but seemed like he didn't even want to accommodate for anything. After my friend spoke to our server, he seemed pretty annoyed of us, insisted we speak to the manager (for the sauce charge???), but he ended up removing it anyway.   Not sure what that was about but overall the customer service wasn't that great and I had higher expectations than this. Our server kept talking to his guy friend at the table across from us and only checked on us once at the beginning.  Probably gonna go another time but won't be back for a while. Thanks for the meh service!"}
{"text":"They have great tasting burgers but their shakes are the best in the world!  I will post my recommendation via photos"}
{"text":"Had a very tasty turkey burger with sweet potato fries here! Nice spot for a faster meal, though this was definitely much nicer than a typical bar. Great Moscow mules, as well!"}
{"text":"Curiosity and a sweet tooth led us in.     Over priced \"specialty\" shakes.   Inedible and cheap candy theatrics.    More whip cream than ice cream.    Bummer.  The place was half full and there was a small line of people waiting to be seated.  We walked in and asked how long the wait was and it was 15 min.    Asked if we could sit anywhere in the bar area.  Said we could.  So we did.  I ended up having to get my own menu.  Decided on the elderflower slush and a $15 Peanut Butter Shake.  This shake was no $15 shake.   It was a $4 at the most.   I have had better shakes from Sonic.    Waitress asked how everything was and I told her how disappointed I was with the shake.   A real let down.  She sort of apologized, I get it, it's not her fault.  Not even a comp and take away.  The shakes commit dessert fraud.  They pointlessly roll the glass in chocolate and candy, shove a couple of tasteless pretzel sticks in there, cram mini peanut butter cups on the rim...and stick a WRAPPED sugar daddy lollipop on the whip cream that gives these shakes their height.   I dug down into the glass hoping to find that $15 bite but it never happened.   It was melted peanut butter ice cream soup.   I can confidently say I won't be back or recommend this place.     There are better options"}
{"text":"Yes, the shakes are 17$! Yes, the burgers are 17$ and Yes! That's the going rate for anything on the strip! BUT at least it was delicious!!   The burger was great (we got the Mexico burger) and my girlfriend got the Vegan burger option. The fries were great (the sweet potato ones were amazing) and they give you 10 options of different sauces....... Other highlight was the fried mozzarella! It came with a little bowl of tomato sauce/soup. So good!!!  And of course! You can't come here and not get dessert! We opted for the cake shake. The cake shake was amazing! Not the normal \"looks good, tastes eh\" the cake was so good and not nearly as messy as i anticipated (even with a two year old in tow)  Our server Kendra was lovely. She was happy to give suggestions and at one point offered my son a lollipop from their massive milkshake candy bar, because his behaved attention span was quickly fading.   I would totally go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin! I came in with a group of girlfriends for a birthday celebration after hearing all the buzz about this new place! We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share including mozzarella sticks, arugula salad, chicken wings, chips and guac, and fried pickles! I can't say which one was my favorite because they were all so delicious.  They have a wide selection of burgers but my friend and I decided to share the truffle burger since we were so full from the apps. The burger was delectable, juicy, amazing. I only had a few bites since I was saving room for dessert.  And of course, you save the best for last: the shakes. Best shake I've ever had in my LIFE. I have a thing for anything Oreo so of course I had to go with the Cookies N Cream Supreme and it was everything I had hoped for. I was already so full from the apps and burger but I couldn't stop slurping down my shake. My girlfriends ordered the other shakes and they looked just as amazing as in the photos.  The staff was great and very welcoming. They were very attentive and always checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay. Most notably though were Mikey and Jonny. It was busy but they took the time to take care of us and made sure we were happy. Thank you Black Tap for the amazing food and hospitality, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific burgers, friendly service, fine beer selection, outlandish shakes- that's a pretty good combination, and it's a very good choice if you're at the Venetian and Palazzo.  The place is tucked away by the poker room in a nook of the casino near the clock tower entrance, and the ambiance is... loud.  Busy and loud.  But it's a good time, and the burgers are excellent (and the shakes are in the take-a-picture-for-Instagram hey-we're-on-vacation-calories-don't-count category)."}
{"text":"Great service. The milkshakes are amazing! Oh my goodness gracious. I don't know how one person can finish one by themselves. I know they have this restaurant in NY and it's very popular. The atmosphere was very causal. Laid back but nice. Good for families. Didn't have a burger because I was saving room for the shake but everyone else in my party were happy:)"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that just opened at the Venetian, this place was a hot spot for many. To my surprise, there were people almost in every seat enjoying shakes and burgers. Yes, it was quite a busy day, but that didn't stop the swift service.   We were seated immediately with super friendly servers who frequently checked up on us.   Our meal:   $16 The All American Burger - This was the burger I got. I thought, you can't go wrong with a classic burger, right? And I didn't. But it wasn't impressive enough to merit a cost of $16. It reminded me of the burger from Ketchup at Planet Hollywood which was slightly cheaper and tasted just the same.   $19 The Mexico City - My girlfriend ordered this, but wasn't impressed. She came for the shake which was pleasing to her palate but as for this burger, not so much. I think the best word to describe it is lackluster. And for $19 a pop, I think we were pretty much disappointed because of the flavors.   $15 The Cookie Shake - One of the best most inventive shakes I've tasted. It was rich and creamy as it was filled with bursting flavors from the beginning to the end. I also loved the presentation of the shake which made the entire visit worthy and appetizing.   $15 Bam Bam Shake - This was the shake I never got to try because our friend ordered it but she definitely enjoyed it. It was colorful and appeared fruity. It's shakes like those that would probably keep us coming back again and again.   Fries - Not a fan. It was your standard, frozen fries that lacked salt or any surprise flavors. Very basic for what you're paying for.   Now, the boiling questions, would I come back? I think so. Just for dessert that is. Everything else could be acquired some place else."}
