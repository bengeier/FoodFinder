{"text":"We tried Janela's for Mother's Day Brunch after a friend who is a member at Rio Secco told us about it. What a beautiful and convenient location for those of us who live in Seven Hills and Anthem
We were greeted and seated immediately and offered Mimosa's as soon as we sat down.Service was impeccable and the servers and staff are superstars.
Now...the food. My expectation of the quality of food is high given the country club environment. Brunch offerings were omelet bar, waffle station and breakfast items.Charcutiere, prime rib,turkey and ham and of course dessert. The ham was one of the best I ever had,prime rib on the other hand, rare and bloody, turkey was dry and not enjoyable. For the amount of guests they had two omelet stations were not enough and there was always a line to wait.
Again staff is amazing including food servers and handlers and all the wait staff. Food preparation needs attention."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch (friend, Italian Wedding Soup, mine, Walnut Pear Salad with Blackened Chicken.)  Cute, friendly bartender Maureen.  Nice dining room decor.  Priced fairly.  Just the kind of lunch you wish for when you're on a little vacation."}
{"text":"Such a pretty location for a restaurant at a country club but unfortunately the food was way too salty. Service was friendly, decor was nice, but the food was not spectacular enough to return. Such a shame..."}
{"text":"Great place for what it is. 

A Country Club Restaurant open to the public for breakfast and lunch. 

Reasonably priced, great menu, great dining room, great staff. 

I have had both breakfast and lunch and can recommend both."}
