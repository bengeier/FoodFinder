{"text":"Favorite one on campus with simple food and  good  staff and the service is fast and easy  served as casual dinner at SAIT campus . The prices are affordable. And the ambiance  is  awsome."}
{"text":"The concept of Denny's All Nighter is a bit different.   This is not a Denny's per say - it's basically a different resurant and it's geared toward campus life.    When SAIT got one this fall in the newest residence building I'd never heard of it - but I guess it's something they've done through out the united states.   The decor is very hip and kind of Hard Rock Cafe chic if I had to put it into words.   It's set up as half like a fast food joint and half like a resturant.  Their menu is different - even for breakfast.  Did you know the concept of toast with breakfast is forgein in the All Nighter?  

Of the new food joints that have openned at SAIT in 2012, this is probably my favorite thus far.  Their food is not steller but it's good.   It's connected to the residence hall and students that live on campus have access to Denny's really late at night (long after campus has shut down).  They don't even have to go outside to get breakfast or grab a bit or coffee during an all nighter  ( a marketing bit I'm not sure I support honestly).    I worry for the level of nutrion coming out of here through....  and in that reguard I'm disappointed the Sobey's this replaces is gone for the sake of the students living in the building.  

An example of the questionable menu items:

\"grilled cheese sandwhich\"  =  breaded and fried mozza sticks covered in additional cheese and them grilled between bread.   I really don't understand why the mozza sticks were needed in this....  it was good but I also had psychosomatic chest pains as I ate this thing. 

Burgers and breakfasts are all pretty good -- they aren't exactly the best but they are good.

{"text":"Very disappointed that I bought my student gift cards for Denny's and they are not accepted at this location. Useless.

As stated, this is NOT a Denny's restaurant in the chain although they have the same signage. Very deceptive."}
