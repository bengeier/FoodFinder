{"text":"The food is very good and authentic. We get take away most of the time although we have eaten in once and had good service. The one time they got my take away order wrong they offered and delivered the correct menu item to my house at no charge. That's service!"}
{"text":"starts and ends with terribly bad service; food is mediocre at best and not served hot; food tastes terrible and certainly not Indian in taste; would never visit again."}
{"text":"We (4 adults and 2 kids) were in for dinner. Order Masala dosa, Chicken Chettinad, panir butter masala an few garlic nan. Food was delicious and flavorful.. Dishes on tables around us were also very tempting. 
Ambiance has scope for improvement, staff need be more professional.
All in all I would come back for dinner here."}
{"text":"My quest for restaurants that serve a decent vegetarian menu landed me here. Was here on a Sunday afternoon, when the GPS on my cell phone pointed this as the nearest restaurant with an Indian menu. Was somewhat suprised that the restaurant was not full. Barely three tables were occupied. Not let down, went ahead and was told that there was a Buffet menu going on for lunch. At less than $13 per head, we gave the Buffet a chance. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the veg dishes. Would give five stars for all the dishes. The crispy pakoras were mouth watering, the veg biriyani was very flavourful, the mushroom peas masala curry was great, the sambar was tasty. Dosas are served at the table and were right on spot. I would recommend this place to friends seeking tasty vegetarian food. I did not get to taste everything that was on the menu, I was fairly full. The one reason I gave four stars, was about the mirch curry - capsicum gravy - it was too hot for me...!!! I would rightly recommend people to avoid this (if you are weak at heart like me). The ambience and decor was standard and classy and the service is very helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I met a couple of friends there this evening and had a disappointing experience. We are all big fans of Indian food who eat at Indian restaurants, locally and internationally, on a regular basis.  The service at Spice South was pretty poor. Papadums weren't complimentary like all the other local Indian restaurants, so we ordered some but were given no chutney. When we asked for chutney or something like it, we were told \"we don't have chutney\". I ordered a lamb dish which, although it was edible and spiced perfectly, was very chewy. I felt quite lucky as another person at our table didn't receive their food at all. We had to track down our apologetic waiter to ask about her order.  Her food eventually showed up, but not until after the rest of us had pretty much finished our meals.  Although they carry a fairly good selection of Indian beers, when we ordered we were informed they were warm and wouldn't serve them to us. I don't think we'll be going back there too soon and I'm giving it a generous two because the flavours were satisfactory."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Charlotte from Los Angeles about 2 years ago for work and have been extremely disappointed by the ethnic food here in general. My wife grew up eating Indian food both here in America and in a dozen other countries and has made us try out just about every Indian restaurant in Charlotte, none of which we have visited for a second time.

About two weeks ago, we decided to try Spice South for a buffet. We were pleasantly surprised- the dishes were unique, spicy and the flavors were very complex! The Chicken Tikka Masala and the Biryani were unbelievable! There were a dozen choices both vegetables and meat. My only criticism was there was a lot of chicken, would have loved some lamb or goat. 

For a buffet of this quality, the price is nothing! Last week we went back and brought my in laws- they fell in love as well! Can't wait to go back and bring some more friends."}
{"text":"Just did take out.  After getting home, we realized that they forgot the naan.  I called, and they insisted we come back out (15+ minute drive) or oh well.  Refused a refund for the naan.  Said they'd make it up to us next time, but we have no proof of that.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Food was nice, but service was lackluster and understaffed.  Naan finally came out after meal was finished...no discussion if we still wanted it, just set it on the table and walked off.  Not sure that I will be back."}
{"text":"This slightly pricey Indian place I haven't tried before had some decent reviews. So we gave it a shot. And we were craving Indian.

We ordered:

    Guthi Vonkaya Kura
    Peshwari Chana (both comes with rice)
    Raita

Ok. First off, the curries were VERY GOOD. Just look at the photo we took (above) Overall, we were pleased. The Kura is a stuffed Indian eggplant, there's a kind of red paste they seem to marinate from the inside, then pan fried. These kind of details I love, gives so much unique flavor. The Chana dish was equally great. Proper spices, and deliciously spicy. I love that they made it proper hot!

The raita was the only disappointment. Extremely watered out, but I'm not a fan of raw white onions anyway...

Now, the prices are normal I suppose of South Charlotte. It did make me hesitate from eating here, until I open my takeaway bag and realized that two dishes was enough to feed 3, 4 ppl. Huge portions.

Will come here again to try the daily lunch buffet. They also had lots of South indian dishes, like Kerala Fish Curry. Made me nostalgic about Kerala and spending a few weeks there for my friend's wedding, eating at Taste of Heaven veg hut three times a week. The only thing I dont like about kerala style food is the coconut and sweetish curries, but anyway. For another time.

{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in town!! Try the Sunday buffet. Food is a bit hot & spicy for most folks. The Special Chicken 65, andhra chicken curry, the spice south chicken curry is delectable. If you don`t like it hot, ask them to tone is down. The service is good too."}
{"text":"Who knows...called and said were open, but arrived and said didn't open till after 5 PM."}
{"text":"Typical Indian Restaurant.  Mediocre service, water without ice and generally overpriced.  Sambar was good, but they aren't generous with the shaak in the dosas.   The shaak needed more taste too.  When 3 of us adults sat down, the waiter only gave us one menu?"}
{"text":"The wife and I usually end up here on Sunday when they serve a buffet. It is an all you can eat style, nothing fancy for $13.99.  I have to say that everything we tasted has the best flavors and the proteins are not overcooked.  If you are looking for great Indian food, check this place out.  A la carte menu for dinner on the evenings and buffet lunches all week.
Good friendly service, mediocre atmosphere(but there is a patio in the parking lot) nothing fancy--just good food.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Compared to all the Indian Buffets I have tasted, this one is \"As good as it gets!  Lunch is a Buffet and Buffet is usually concept I avoid!  Glad for me I could make this exception!  One of the reasons I avoid buffets is the lack of Quality!  Today this Buffet BEAT (Buffeted) the quality of many Indian Restaurants Dinner Quality!

I tasted almost everything on the Buffet, which was quite a selection and enjoyed everything!  Some of the Dishes I returned for seconds (Chicken Tikka Masala and the Okra Curry)!  The Dal and Naan were good, the Rice was plain!  

CURRY!  This was a Curry Lovers dream come true! The wide variety of Flavors (also rare in Buffets) of Curries was surprising, each had a unique Look and flavor.  The Spice Levels included some Mild, some approaching Medium and a few a little more than medium, though none \"Hot\" and I have NEVER ordered any dish \"Indian Hot\", though Jason ordered \"Make it so Hot it Hurts\" once, at another place, not here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for the weekend buffet, and there is so much variety for someone to be content. 

Oddly, sometimes they will make you dosa and sometimes not upon your request. 

Service isn't all that great. 

The biggest downside is that the price is a bit high for a buffet, so be sure to eat as much as possible to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"We order the Tikki Marsala and some naan bread To Go and it was amazing.  We love Indian food and have eaten at several other places in Charlotte and for the $ this place is much better.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavorful food. The appetizers and entree were amazing. Our waiter was very helpful in deciphering the menu  and helping an Indian food novice select the perfect entree. The only part of our meal that rated average was the dessert. Will make this place a favorite!"}
{"text":"First visit on a Wednesday evening and should have known the results when we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Weren't welcomed before being seated which I can overlook.  Overall felt uncomfortable being there and then service was lackluster.  Food was decent.  Willing to give it another try for the weekend buffet."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner the other night.  When we walked up half the staff was sitting outside on the deck which was a little awkward for us.  

We were asked to seat ourselves as the place was pretty much empty.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had a vegetable curry.  Both dishes were pretty good but the whole situation with ordering, etc was just awkward.  

The prices here are very comparable to the Blue Taj down the road in Ballantyne.  We both agreed that we would probably stick to the Taj in this area for Indian dining going forward."}
