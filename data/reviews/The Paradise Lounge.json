{"text":"This is my favorite dive bar in Madison. Their lunch is really delicious for the cost ($5-$8). The atmosphere does look like it was pulled from a 80's northwoods bar, but that's what gives it charm. The wait staff are always very friendly and fast, and will make the effort to talk to you while waiting for your food. At night, their drinks are cheap and strong."}
{"text":"Having moved to Seattle in 2006, I was disappointed on a recent visit home to see a lot of my favorite bars have already changed.  (sofas at the Lava Lounge in place of their pool table!?!  Hungry Kids and family's ruining a good depressing happy hour at Micky's on Willy st?!?)  So it's refreshing to know that you can still go to the Paradise Lounge on a weeknight and get into the same crazy drunken funny situations you come to expect at a place like this. God bless you Paradise. Stay sweet, never change."}
{"text":"Just about every other bar in Madison is where the college kids go to learn to drink; Paradise is where the professionals ply their trade. The staff is friendly and entertaining, especially if a geezer gets way too specific about his Diet Pepsi order. In the short time I was there on a Sunday afternoon, I saw another old-timer nearly fall asleep over his Budweiser and had a middle-aged guy tell me his own \"big city\" story, which amounted to \"the one time Kanye West was on my flight.\" The juke provided a welcomed relief from 'Now That's What I Call Music 49'. I didn't have time to eat but the food that came past my post at the end of the bar smelled delicious. I can't think of a reason not to return."}
{"text":"Its the Paradise, okay?  That's all.  Have a drink, bring your friend, yeah, the one you still have.  You'll be fine.  My ex-ex bf and I stopped in here once years ago, blitzed from a pitcher at 5 other bars...we kissed sitting at the bar, no one flinched...yes, its that kinda place...you'll laugh, you'll cry...and no one will wonder why..."}
{"text":"I call the Paradise burger the best bar burger in town. The decor is nothing but dive. It smells pretty bad and the bathrooms are super nasty, but I will go there every chance I get. I love that burger. Mmmmmmmmmm Oh and they are cheap, too."}
{"text":"It is properly categorized as \"Dive Bar\" because Yelp doesn't have a \"Dump\" category. However, it seems to an outsider a safe dive (dump) given the size of some of the dudes tending bar and grilling. I had the impression that they were capable of ripping the arms off any troublemakers and beating them to within an inch of their life with their own newly-useless limb.  Three stars for an unapologetic dump even though it smells pretty strongly of pee."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY dive-y which is not necessarily a bad thing but it could be better. I went here with my buddy a couple of times and I enjoy the norwegian log cabin type atmosphere. The thing I don't like about this place is that the staff does not know when to kick people out... Shouting? Sure... little rough housing? No problem... A homeless guy passed out at the bar with a full beer in front of him? WOW its time to go... I may return to this place but like some of the other reviews said I am definitely not going out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"We come to Madison for an annual business meeting and drop thousands at this bar every year.  The owner's daughter-in-law is awesome but she has a baby now and didn't work much this year. Instead we were treated to the worst group of \"bartenders\" I've ever been witness to. I use quotations as there are real bartenders in Madison who are serious about their craft, just not any in here.  The service got progressively worse each night until reaching a crescendo on Friday night (8/26/16) as we waited ridiculous amounts of time for service while the \"bartenders\" washed dishes, took shots and visited with their friends and then the event with Ron C. took place.  I think it was the owner's son who acted like a psychopath as he yelled at Ron for what was his inability to run a bar.  I'm all for bartenders having fun as it makes for a better environment but they went right past fun to being absolute assholes. The owner needs to put his boy in check, fire his staff and hire a nanny for his daughter-in-law as she is the only one in this place who is worthy of your patronage. If you aren't from here don't waste your time at the 'dise, they apparently don't like outsiders or money."}
{"text":"After the joke of the American on tap we wound up at this cool dive bar. It's a narrow place with a pool table, foosball table and gambling machines. The place had lots of wood tables and booths. Flat screen tv's with in eye view. Regulars were coming and going while we were there.  The staff and regulars were very nice to the new people. The place attracts a diverse group people and had the feel of a nice hang out place. The place is narrow with lots of wood tables and booths. There was your typical small selection of draft beers. Zombie dust was on tap for our tour.     If you look at my picture you will see a grill on the left right next to where people sit at the bar. They do have food but I didn't try any. This was a genuine cool dive bar and I would be back."}
{"text":"This place is good for being a dive bar. My husband and I stopped in here last minute to get some food and a drink. The mixed drink I had was very weak. If I didn't see the bartender make it I would have thought she didn't put any alcohol in it. As for the food, the burgers are very greasy so make sure you ask for extra napkins however their cheese curds / cheese balls are amazing."}
{"text":"Get ready for some gool ole' fashioned head banging and dangerously cheap drinks at this rocker bar on the square.  Fun place with a pool table and dart machines (of course)."}
{"text":"My favorite dive bar in town, maybe my favorite bar overall.  Good drink specials, good atmosphere, & probably the most diverse clientele in town."}
{"text":"Giving it a 5, if you're a hipster or frat kid this isn't the bar for you (thank goodness) beer is cheap service fast"}
{"text":"Back in the day when I lived in Madison, I just about lived in the 'Dise, which was where everyone I knew and their brothers used to hang out. I had to go back and show my husband my old stomping ground, for old time's sake. Yep, it's the same. Thanks for not changing, Paradise. And thank you even more to the patrons who didn't steal my wallet after I accidentally left it there (whoops!)"}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem!  Madison's premiere seedy, little hideaway.  We were treated like family, enjoyed great drinks, great staff, great locals.  TV's everywhere.  Pool, foosball, gambling machines, juke box: it has it all.  Joe poured with a heavy hand, joined us in a shot and made fun and witty conversation.  Everything you want in a bartender/owner.  If you're in Madison, this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"I came in after a concert on a Sunday night (when, for some odd reason, many of their neighbors were closed - my guess is that the city shuts down for spring break... or something), there were actually a handful of people in there around 11:30pm. After a weekend of partying, I was mostly there for some hydration and to catch up with a friend from out of town (staying at a nearby hotel). The atmosphere wasn't quite 'paradise' ... more like a log cabin with some darts and pool tables. Their signage is pretty vintage, food options listed on a classic sign in a few places throughout the bar with those individual letters to create each item.  The only thing I found to be paradise-like, was the fact that their grill was STILL OPEN! Yes, a bar with a grill, open past 10pm. I think she said they will keep it open until 1:30am or even close. Yes, it's bar food... but you're looking at cheese curds, deep fried broccoli bites, and in my case - I got their last ham and cheese sandwich!  The bartender was very nice and friendly. She was especially knowledgeable on what was on tap, even giving great suggestions on what we may like."}
{"text":"So I am in this place with a group of friends trying to get a drink. It was a little busy but not overcrowded like I have seen it in years past. My friends and I waited a long time for a bar tender to stop and ask us what we wanted. This went on for over 15 minutes. In the meantime I watch several of other patrons get served, I watched the female bartender flirt with another friend of mine across the bar and serve everyone on that end exclusively at which point I shot my friend the bird as he saw me waiting for an eternity and thought it was funny, I think the young female barkeep thought I flipped her off and then went and told all of the other bar staff that I did it to her, then I see different one of them take a few shots, after what was easily 30 minutes I spoke up loudly and asked is I was going to be able to get a drink, the female then told me that if I kept yelling at her I would never get one. My friend then decided to get his card back and that we would try our luck elsewhere. It seems as though the inexperienced staff misplaced his card. My friend got a little riled up as they could not find it and were once again ignoring us. So I said what in the hell is going on here? That's when some huge monster behind the bar starts yelling at me at the top of his lungs calling me a bad tipper and that I'm a fucking idiot and every other thing he could think to scream. While he was doing this the young female came by and flipped me off and said something I couldn't hear as the hot head was screaming so loud. He then kicked me out of the bar and continued to scream. I told him to fuck himself and left. I assure you, I and my friends will never be back. You may want to actually investigate what happened from all sides before you lose your mind at someone. Someday some deranged person might do something terrible back to you after being assaulted in such a way. I am not that guy but bars can be a hotbed of hot heads and you showed yourself to be one when it is your job to remain calm and sort things out. This place is a dump full of rude people! If you value your life don't go in this place."}
{"text":"5 star for diviness!  So you sit with some of the regulars, or stare at their photos above the grill, and you'll realize why people come back. During the afternoon, the tvs are quiet and people whisper during the games, only to pipe up on commercials.  Michelle's first day was mine as well. She didn't know the prices but it didn't matter for the 9 patrons there. The regulars gladly accepted her, as did her neighbor from upstairs.  Large bar area for the many house flies that were speeding through the air. Nice place to drink, though I'd rather not dine there with the flies about. Sorry. Cheap? Sure. Hospitable? Yep. The heavily tattoo'd chef was very friendly discussing baseball nonsense from me and the others. Hell, he even got in on a friendly conversation I had with some other Chicagoans there.   Plus, they serve their drafts in fantastic mason jars with handles. Stools are broken in and are sturdy.   The regulars make this bar. Drinking Hamm's on the corner and offering advice to visitors with a smile and no venom? A guy could get used to it. And the ATM forgot to give me a service charge.  (oh and flat screen tv's? I saw one, the big on in the center in the back room...the rest were box's.)"}
{"text":"Excellent dive bar with cheap drinks and low lights. Their fryer is hot, but it wouldn't be a destination for dinner."}
{"text":"[NOTE: I'm reviewing this as a foodie, and someone who doesn't consume alcohol on a regular basis. Also as a foodie who went into this take out experience without realizing this was listed as a \"Dive Bar.\" Because I'm an observant male human like that.]  So it was a little off-putting to walk in and see the circle of counter space surrounding the bartender. And it was a little awkward walking up to him and asking for my takeout. And I basically just wanted out of there asap. He didn't do much to assuage my uneasiness either, since he never actually said a word to me. Are bartenders usually that much of a hardass? As a non-bargoer, I just kind of assumed all bartenders are part time therapists and best friends as well. Probably my naive Christian college experience talking. Take that paragraph as you will.  Anyways, the burger I ordered. I got the Paradise because, why not, it's safe, and this is the Paradise Lounge. (Side note: I was SEVERELY disappointed that their lunch menu did not carry over to dinner. I'm sure there's some marketing or ingredient pricing reasoning behind it, but there were some tasty looking burgers on that menu that I basically wasn't allowed to try because it was 8PM. Dumb.) Let me just say, the entire way home, my car smelled AWFUL because of this burger. Like, I had no desire to open the box encasing whatever fowl-smelling creation Mr. Grumpypants handed me. Do it for the Yelp, though.  And (thank God), it didn't taste nearly as bad as it smelled. But, it was unremarkable. Just another burger. Honestly feel like I could have got the same thing anywhere else - and probably a larger one, too...This thing was tiny. But I mean, it was palatable. So that's always a good thing, I suppose.  My advice: If you're like me, and not trying to drink away your Friday or just have a good time with friends (AKA, you just want some local grub), go during lunch and try one of the burgers I wasn't able to."}
{"text":"I have no clue why this place is so overrated..#4 in reviews? Really? I mean -- its OK but it's not like I think to myself I'm setting out to go here. That said, I do like the drinks, food and atmosphere better than some of the dives around town. I think its a good mix of a dive bar yet sociable."}
{"text":"The 'Dise is one of the best bars in Madison. Maybe the country. Maybe the world! Everyone is welcome. The juke box is great. The food is exactly what you want after a night of drinking cheap pitchers of beer. No pretentiousness. "}
{"text":"The beer was cold and really good (Spotted Cow...must try it if you haven't), the food was great (and cheap) and it's just a great bar to hang out in."}
{"text":"Genius for selling fried food after 12AM. Just perfect.  Currently playing \"Love Shack.\" Also sells cigs. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a five star dive bar. Great food. Stiff drinks. Low prices. You don't have to put on any pretend attitude here ... Nobody cares. Enjoy with friends. Great location."}
{"text":"Dropped back by when I did a quick trip through Wisconsin. Still the same! Some of the same people on the same stools! Cheap, strong drinks, yessir! And yup, some coke residue on toilet paper dispenser in the men's room.  This is real bar."}
{"text":"Where is the loud heavy metal music I was promised in the last Yelp reviews? Damn you, yelpers! Still a pretty good dive bar atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"The drinks are great, the ambiance is great if you like that kind of thing, the jukebox is one of the better ones in town. I only have two complaints - the pool table, pinball, and large seating area are all in the back of the room. That's fine when it's not busy, but if it is, you're better off sneaking in through the back and pretending you just came in from a smoke break. Otherwise, it's hell trying to get through the narrow pathway between the bar and the booths along the wall. My other complaint is that when Stoli came out with their blueberry flavored vocka, one of the bartenders told me it was gross. No way, it's so good, just mix it with cranberry juice and 7 Up!"}
{"text":"Paradise is right. Loved this little slice of local flavor just beyond the reach of the college scenesters. Visiting Paradise prompted my friends and I to discuss the differences between a \"dive bar\" and an \"old man bar\". I'd more properly classify Paradise as an old man bar because 1) It was full of old men when we went and seems like exactly the kind of place you'd find your grandpa in 2) It's a little worn and shabby, but its not gross and dirty 3) It has none of the trappings of the false, nouveau \"dive bars\" that cater to a more yuppie clientele.   Drinks are cheap cheap cheap ($4 for a large pint, they also have specials and happy hours) and they had a nice selection of local beers on tap. Bartenders were friendly and funny. Fried cheese curds were delish (but how could fried cheese not be delicious, right?). Really loved this bar as a low key place to just have some beers with friends in peace. It was pretty quiet when we went during the week, but seemed to be picking up steam around 10pm when we left.  Side notes: There is a pool table, dart board, and digital juke box. They also sell a few snack items, and apparently cigarettes by the pack."}
{"text":"I went to this bar based on yelp reviews, and everything said was absolutely true.  Yes, there was crazy headbanger music, but it was played at the perfect volume, so you could rock out to it but still talk to your friends.  Yes, the bartender and patrons were super friendly.  I felt like we were family by the time I left.  Yes, the cheese curds and burgers were delicious.  It was my first time eating cheese curds and I was impressed.  I also think its the only reason I don't have a hangover right now.  And yes, it's a dive bar.  But a really friendly dive bar with an interesting mix of people and the best bartenders ever!  Oh, and if you are staying at the best western, you can crawl back to your hotel room.  Like I did."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a dive in downtown Madison, then you definitely should check out Paradise.  There's 2 reasons why Paradise gets a 5 in my book:  1)  They have cheap beer.  Speciifically, the $5.50 PBR/Leinenkugel pitchers are a steal. 2)  The \"ambience\" is top notch.  It attracts a great and varied crowd, with people of all ages and income.  Also, they play metal music really loudly all of the time.  So, if 80's thrash is your thing, then you'll feel welcome at Paradise.  These 2 points alone very easily help me ignore all of the shortcomings of paradise:  The lack of decor, the food not being very good, the sort of weird layout, etc. etc.  But they don't matter to me, because that isn't what I come to Paradise for.  I go to Paradise to get away from the fancy drinks and yuppies that inhabit most other bars in the area, and to welcome the simple pleasure of drinking domestics to hard rock music."}
{"text":"Decent dive bar.  Cheap beer.  Blue collar + hipster.  Lots of fried food options.  Bartenders are friendly.  Foosball and darts.  Yesssss."}
{"text":"I know this is classified as a dive bar and usually I love a good dive bar but this one was super disappointing.    A) The bartender never stopped complaining, loudly, about everything.  From the way the beer was pouring, to customers getting too drunk the night before, to management not being specific enough, and about how poor tips were, and on and on.  Since it was 3 in the afternoon and there were like 4 people in there, it was really off-putting.  B) The beer lines are dirty.  The beers are foamy and buttery tasting.  The lines need to be cleaned.    C) The food was pretty good.  No complaints, really.  We had the cheeseburgers and some fries and onion rings.    I just wanted to like this place more."}
{"text":"metal music, homeless people, and amazing fried mushrooms"}
{"text":"If you can get to the 'Dise before there's nowhere to sit down, it's one of the most fabulous dive bars on the planet.  If you can't find a seat, you might as well leave.  I dare you to try to have a beer while standing there.  It's quite the unpleasant experience.  My top 3 reasons for loving the 'Dise: 1) Slayer, old school Metallica, and Interpol on the jukebox. 2) Incredible fried cheese curds (here, they're called \"cheese balls\"). 3) $1.25 longneck PBR's on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Only in America do places aspire to be a dive bar. Usually it is just a segue to bigger things. This place embraces, loves, and vocally recommends itself. Loud punk, cold beer, and a surprisingly good burger.   The place doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. I was off a flight and hungry. Perfect."}
{"text":"I don't go to dive bars very often, but Paradise Lounge is going to be my choice going forward.  I don't really have too much to say about the Lounge. The drinks are super cheap, the food is ok, and they play a lot of metal music.  Since I'm a metalhead, the music gives a much-needed break from the top 40 music playing at most other bars that makes me feel out of place. Plus, it's not blasting, so you can still hold a conversation without yelling or eavesdrop on other patrons if that's your kind of thing.  Like I mentioned, the food is ok, but this is a dive bar and not a gastropub. The curds are too breading-heavy for me, but their signature Paradise burger is solid. I found the bun to be too toasty for my preference, but there's bacon, cheese, and grilled onions on it, so I'm happy. I'd say that the food is a little better than the public pool concession stand that I worked at in high school.  If you're interested in trying something new, stop by Paradise Lounge!"}
{"text":"Ever since I started drinking there have been $1.50 rails at the Dise on Tuesday nights.  God bless this place."}
{"text":"This is basically the only acceptable bar to go to in Madison, WI if you are not a hippie or college student. It is dingy, it is gross, the bartenders are surly and these is a distinctive 'dise smell that permeates your clothing and your soul. I love it like a second home.   The drinks are cheap, the place is LOADED with interesting people, (read possible criminals? senators with their escorts? other assorted ne'er-do-wells? who cares?) the music is loud and Misfit-y. The bartenders aren't THAT surly and some still remember me some 5 years after leaving Madison. They make the drinks strong, and they are FAST!It gets pretty packed after 9 on any given night, so I recommend getting there early. Around noon is acceptable.   The food's pretty top notch. It is your typical bar fare, but if I hear another person rave about the 'dise burger, I may have to abandon my vegetarian principals to find out how awesome it is for myself. Luckily, I will always have the the cheese balls, which are vegetarian-ish.Thier greasy, stringy, melty dipped in ranch cheesiness has me missing Wisconsin on a semi-regular basis. For the vegans in your life, there are green olives. Soaked in vodka. Just eat them.   5 years and 3 trips back to Madison, this is the place I have the airport cabbie drop me off first."}
{"text":"If you want to get out of the city and go to a bar from a small town, here it is.  I like it right near the capitol."}
{"text":"Looking for craft cocktails?  Homemade tinctures and bitters?  Mixologists wearing vests and ironic mustaches?  Well, keep moving because the 'dise has none of these!  What is does have is pure divey goodness.  Cheap beer.  Cheap (and strong) drinks.  An interior that hasn't changed in at least 20 years.  They also have a grill/fryer that serves up not a bad cheeseburger.  The clientele can be pretty varied which only adds to the charm. What I like most about this place is that it leaves all pretense at the door.  It is a bar and grill.  No slick marketing.  No \"themes\".  Just booze and food.  And who can argue with that combo?"}
{"text":"I've been to the 'dise plenty of times, but since I went twice on Saturday, it seems about time to review it and all its divey glory.  Everything is crazy cheap, they've got a varied juke box, cute two-person booths, and a fairly open space in the back of the room. Also: mason jars.  Saturday was my first time eating at the Paradise, despite hearing raves about their burgers for years. On trip number one, we stopped by because a friend in our group had met up with us late and hadn't gotten lunch with us. He ordered and a grilled cheese, cheese curds (or, as the 'dise calls them, cheese balls), and fries. Too much for one man, he shared the curds & fries with us. The cheese curds were breaded and cheddar, and delicious albeit nothing special. The fries were crinkle-cut, crispy, and so, so good. I could have eaten the entire basket myself. Nom nom nom.  My second trip of the day came with wanting to grab a late dinner between a movie and a concert next door at the Frequency. I ordered a cheeseburger, and my friend ordered a Paradise Burger and a diet Coke. Mine was $5, hers was $5.25. I have no idea how that worked out, but she totally won. Though very, very tasty, my $5 got me a bun, a slice of cheese, pickles, and a patty. Her $5.25 got her a drink, and my basic burger plus carmelized onions, tomato, and lettuce, plus, I believe, bacon.   Again - no idea how her burger cost less than mine with so much more (especially because it was 9:30 on a Saturday - not a happy hour special), but next time I will definitely be ordering that instead."}
{"text":"i love the 'dise. it's one of very few dive bars near the square. if you get there early enough you can grab a table and play darts with your friends while sipping wonderfully cheap beer and eating some nasty fried food. the jukebox is pretty solid, too. no frills, which is just how a dive should be."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch hungry, and had just twenty minutes to order something that would take the edge off.  I chose the chili and a side salad and had 4 minutes to get back to the office, which was 3 minutes away if I heeled quick.  Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Divey. Diverse (and I mean diverse) group of people. From the first time I was in this place and someone was carrying a skillet on a backpack to this most recent time when I am pretty sure a meth head stole the glass from my table, you never know what you will find at the Paradise.  I would have it no other way."}
{"text":"Bartenders forced us out before bar time (we were sitting quietly at the bar) and they yelled and cussed us out for \"being rude and disrespectful\" for trying to finish drinks we had paid for. Pretty sure the staff was intoxicated - just completely rude. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Ah, let me just say, where else would you get $1.50 rail on Tuesday night? How about a basket of a large fries on top of that?? See, when it comes to the place that really matters, no one comes close to the dise. And, the bartenders are so cool, too ;) If you're a girl, you might get turned off by some gentlemen trying to attract your attention.  But if you're the type to come here, I know you can handle it.   And the bathroom -  brings back the memories of the days when I passed out on it. Dive."}
{"text":"I had a nice time watching a Badgers game here. There were three screens with the game on as well as the radio, which I appreciated. The crowd ran a bit older but was pretty friendly and included some folks taking a break from the Recall Walker rally. There was a decent tap selection for sports bar and the prices were fair. The bartender kept the deep fryer running to take care of the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Oh the Dice, what can you not say about this place. Has this bar changed ever? I think not.   The staff, on the most part, make this place. They can dish it back to all kinds of dynamic groups of people. Street people to politicians. You see them all in this place.   Some of the best bar food around. Curds and their freshly grilled burgers are some of the best around the square."}
{"text":"Five star bid!  This joint is almost the perfect dive bar.  Located right on capital square near a couple of either seedy joints.. this stretch of street seems stuck in time!  Inside, it's a classic horseshoe bar with the two level \"Drink Area\" bar, a pool table, jukebox, and DARK lighting!  Trust me, you couldn't tell day from night sitting in this joint for a million bucks.  Clientele ranges from locals & college kids to tourists & tinder dates looking for a shady spot!  Beers and drinks are dirt cheap and they have food to boot.  Bartender was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the area and gave us many good suggestions, TIP WELL!  Talk later"}
{"text":"One has to admire an establishment that when you go to the bar and request, \"A pitcher of your cheapest beer, please.\"  You actually have a few choices.  The jukebox is pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"Go late for fried cheese curds.  Leave early before they turn the lights on."}
{"text":"What was once an unpretentious bar with a good jukebox has now amazingly morphed into a depressing shithole."}
{"text":"I don't think this can be called a dive anymore now that the TVs are flatscreen jobs.  I was told by a friend that this was going to be all punks and bikers but it was just normal folks--not that there's anything wrong with that as I'm too old to hang around with the former types.  Being used to Chicago prices, I almost choked when I ordered cheese curds and two beers and got change from my 10.  I finished the night off with a can of Hamm's which I believe cost $1.50  All this within view of the Capitol?  Paradise."}
{"text":"Good food, staff works hard.  New flooring = less divey, yet still divey enough.  One of my go-to spots downtown.  Very limited bro-vibes, if any."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger itself is worth four or five stars - it was the best one I have had in Madison. The atmosphere is classic local dive bar, though. Swearing patrons and loud voices, with classic rock playing in the background. I would definitely go again for the burger, but I probably wouldn't bring my grandma."}
{"text":"IPA and cheese curds in an old reliable, definitively Dive Bar favorite here in Madison.   It's been awhile since I've been here and not much has changed.     Great (mostly Wisconsin beers) on tap; great service; sports on the TV; and assured heartburn from the delicious fried menu items. Brats and burgers are good. Don't skip trying the cheese curds or onion rings."}
{"text":"Carpet bar with efficiently priced beers, slightly used pool tables, and a great smelling atmosphere. Perfect place for a first date or to celebrate grandma's 82nd birthday. Enough TVs for any sporting event AND movie marathons on AMC. Waiting for them to open another Paradise Lounge in Milwaukee. 5/5, 2/2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've never lived in Madison, but as a visitor I've been to this place a half dozen times over the last few years, often when in town solo, and always have ended up having a good time.  5 stars for a bar with a great jukebox and friendly staff where even if you go alone you don't end up drinking alone- no attitude from the friendly, reasonably social fellow drinkers."}
{"text":"This bar is probably the best dive bar in the entire capitol area. They don't have a great beer/drink selection, but is this really where you'd go to take advantage of such a thing? What they offer instead is an interesting atmosphere, diverse crowd, weird layout, constant soundtrack of classic/ hard rock and thrash metal being played from the jukebox, and pitchers of PBR that cost $5.50 (a great deal considering that tall boys can run as high as $6 in some of the more outrageous nearby establishments). All in all, it's a reliably enjoyable place to visit.  As a side note, my personal opinion of this place was marred last year when this guy sitting near my party produced easily the worst-smelling fart any of us have ever experienced. It was so terrible that it caused an immediate spell of silence upon our table, as we could taste it in our mouths and it made our eyes water. I will never again be able to think of the paradise without thinking of this incident, but I did not consider this in my review."}
{"text":"Hmm lets see, cheap drinks, awesome bar food and a nice plethora of random people. What more could you ask for from a dive bar? Been going here for a few months with no complaints! 1.50 rail mixers on Tuesday? Solid. Definitely come here."}
{"text":"The burger is the way to go! I'm a burger snob and to find a dive bar who has an amazing  burger for cheap, can't beat it. Not including their drinks...  I like craft beer but I will go down on cheap beer(PBR) on a Saturday for $6.00 a pitcher.   This will def be my chill spot."}
{"text":"If you're in the Madison area (near the State Capitol), I definitely recommend this place for a fun/chill dive-bar atmosphere. When we walked in, we immediately heard the Smoking Popes playing on the sound system and saw a bunch of people shooting pool and having a good time.   Service: The bartenders were awesome- they were quick to get our drinks/food started and were super patient with my group and the many times we went up to redeem our \"cardboard crack\"- aka Wisconsin lottery pull tabs.   Drinks: reasonable prices and great selection. I'm a huge fan of ciders and they had my favorite- which I don't find very often at dive bars (it's usually the standard Angry Orchard or Redd's which I'm not a fan of).   Food: food choices were simple and seemed frozen. The mac n cheese bites were incredible! The chicken strips were kind of salty but the plus is that their kitchen is open late."}
{"text":"Dive bar pretty much sums it up. You're looking for a cheap beer and interesting company this is your place. Didn't try any of their food but the menu looked decent enough. Our afternoon visit to the Paradise lounge was possibly our last. Return trips to Madison will probably not include this local yokel hang out. Unless of course we're down on our luck and the horses just aren't paying off."}
{"text":"The 'dise is closest thing Madison has to a punk bar but no worries, this place has just about zero pretension.  Dark and probably dirty (it's really too dark to tell), this bar is known for it's no frills atmosphere and tasty bar food.    Stop in and order some cheap beer and a burger but don't expect to be 'seen'.  The patrons are too busy staring into their drinks."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a beer and a guy smoking a cigarette on the sidewalk said \"Go in here! It has wonderful people, and good times\" so we figured, why not? Good choice. This is a classic dive bar run by cool people.   I stumbled in here with a friend of mine after a few laps around the capitol building protesting. We walked in about 4 on a Saturday and the place was jumping thanks to all the folks protesting up the street. We sat at the end of the bar and started drinking. Actually we got to meet and goof around with some of the workers and they were an amazing bunch of super cool ladies. I was feeling a bit wacky so I started buying shots and drinks and I think I walked in here with $100 and left with probably only $20. Not bad for an evening before 6 in a bar with cheap drinks. The female bartenders are smart, attractive, and witty and really made our brief drunken visit worthwhile. I am so glad we were on foot for the day and could just let it rip listening to some amazing tunes (Black Sabbath) on the juke box and talking to some down to earth people. We struck up random conversations with random people. It was very cool to be in a bar that was welcoming and not full of people sharing space but traveling in antisocial packs. A guy was actually $1 short for his pitcher, and I gave him the buck. Why not? The vibe was awesome here.   This super nice tall bartender April was just a joy to chat with. I have a huge crush on her I think. :)   If I had been less drunk, I would have had a burger. Heck, if I had one of those amazing looking burgers I might not have such a hangover the next morning.   Cool staff? Check.  Cheap drinks? Check  Cheap food? Check.  ."}
