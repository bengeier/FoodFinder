{"text":"Ate here during restaurant week and we had the wine pairing with our servings. 

The appetizer and dessert were delicious and the wines complemented the food perfectly. The filet mignon could have been better and was not cooked to our liking but they took care of that on the bill. 

All in all a great dining experience in a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow - we went to Ko'sin for dinner just after Christmas. The view from the restaurant was beautiful and the food was fantastic.  All the flavors were unique and delicious. (Loved the Double Chocolate Cake) The only thing better was our waiter, Rob.  He was extremely professional and made sure we had everything we needed, making our evening memorable.  Do yourself a favor - try out Ko'sin and ask for Rob.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here, and my husband's burger came with raw spots (ordered medium well). He found this out by cutting it in half before he bit into it, so the raw juices dripped into the bun. We sent it back, and they re-fired it, then it was sent back on the same bun. Beyond tacky and not safe. We sent it back and said they can keep it. We gave it a second shot late night, and ordered a charcuterie plate and pot roast sliders. The charcuterie plate came out with hardened (petrified) cheddar, stale baguette slices and sub-par meats. Disgusting. Sliders came out cold with ice cold fries. Sent the sliders back and they came out still cold with buns hard as a rock. We have four days here, and we won't be back to this restaurant (or this hotel)."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal!  The tortilla soup and fish tacos were outstanding.  We had a great time and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Luxuriously sumptuous meal and presentation was top notch. Husband and I celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary at this location and couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the food. We ordered the bacon wrapped buffalo meatloaf mainly because where else are you going to find such a menu item?! as well as fried zucchini served with an aioli sauce. If you are seeking a quality adventurous dining experience, this place will certainly please."}
{"text":"The complimentary black bean hummus starter was wonderful. Our mesquite filet mignons were done to perfection and were so tender & juicy. The mashed potatoes & five cheese spinach sides were just okay - nothing special. They had a nice by the glass wine selection and the service was perfect. However, the ambiance was rather disappointing given the setting - we had a view of a wall and the table across the way."}
{"text":"Wow. In town for the super bowl and decided to eat at our hotel. We certainly made the right choice! My filet was perfect and my wife said it was one of the best meals she's ever had. Corn cheesecake for dessert was fantastic. Great server too. Thanks Robert C."}
{"text":"You're here at the Sheraton resort, so this is really your only option. It's good food, with a native/southwest flair. Prices are high, as you would expect."}
{"text":"It's way out there. Way out there. Three stars, not four, because the place doesn't realize it's a four star place. Very good and interesting food. A quality wine list. Good service. If there is a weak link I suspect it is the behind the scenes folks responsible for training. I shared a fantastic cheese plate with the table; I have no idea what the cheeses were. I suspect the server hasn't been trained to name and describe the plate. Please eat here. The food is good, and you're supporting an Indigenous nation. And this is to management, my waiter was courteous and prompt; help him be better by investing in, and respecting, him by training him more thoughtfully."}
{"text":"Stayed at this resort for one night and had dinner at Kosins. Service was slow even though the place was empty. Food was cold and mediocre at best. Resort was beautiful but restaraunt not up to the hotels standard. Will not recommend this  place and will not return.  Poor customer service from waitstaff and management. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Our meals were prepared expertly and the flavors were amazing. The hotel here also houses a true 5-star restaurant but we chose Ko'Sin and we're not disappointed! I had a braised lamb shank with cheesy grits and greens. My mom had a fantastic duck confit with mushrooms and puréed parsnip in pasta that was a blend of delectable flavors. Friendly and skilled staff!"}
{"text":"We were tired of banquet and casino food so decided to have dinner at Ko'Sin. Started with the chicken tortilla soup which had a thick tomato base. I'm used to more of a chicken broth or cream chicken base. It was good but not great.

The beef short ribs with gnocchi was simply fantastic! That had to be the most tender beef I have ever had my life. Really a fine dish with an explosion of taste without being overpowering on any one ingredient.

For desert I had the milk chocolate pumpkin bread pudding with tons of whipped cream and a nice sauce. It wasn't what I expected but it was delicious nonetheless. 

The service was absolutely among the finest I have ever experienced anywhere, and I'm pretty tough to please. Our waiter, Alex, was impeccable and even the busboy Chris was on top of things. I didn't have any special order but the table near me was disappointed that there was no prawn cocktail. The waiter consulted the kitchen and a great prawn cocktail was produced within minutes. 

Ko'Sin gets five stars for the service alone. And the meal was great overall."}
{"text":"This restaurant overlooks the pool area of the Sheraton Grand Wild Horse Pass resort in Chandler, Arizona.  Though it is casual in terms of dress, the food is not standard fare.  The menu has a number of unusual dishes that can satisfy yearning for something a bit different.  The restaurant is also spread out across several rooms.  The waiters were energetic and their service was prompt.  I had a very satisfying meal, though good service and off the beaten path cuisine comes at a price, as one would expect given that this is a hotel dining venue.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are staying at the resort."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and they were not busy. Some of our dishes were good but some were not. My pork chop was a little over cooked. The waiter stayed away from the table for an extended period of time"}
{"text":"The food here was great! We had the Mac n cheese for a starter and it was awesome. I had the meatloaf and my husband had the gnocchi with beef short rib. Everything was very good! The service was good as well. I just felt like the ambiance fell short of my expectations considering the pricing of the meal."}
{"text":"Overall this was not very good place service slow food is bland water tastes like dirt add a cocktail   Did not taste good too sour  And still left hungry"}
{"text":"We went here for my Bourgie Birthday Dinner: 2k11 Edition.  There's nothing worse than paying top-shelf prices for poorly executed food, and I'm happy to report that this place was great.  After a comical adventure exploring what seemed like the entire reservation, we had a meal to remember.

Wife was a bit worried by the steak-heavy menu, but those worries proved totally unfounded.  We split the crab dip, a house salad, a scallop dish, and the gnocchi.

Each dish was well-portioned, well-prepared, and expertly seasoned.  The scallops were seared just-so; the top crispy, the rest of the scallop slightly chewy and smooth.  The bed of greens they sat upon were a perfect contrast, and the accompanying potatoes mirrored the scallops: slightly crispy on the outside, smooth and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.  Every few bites had a bit of cheese (gorgonzola?) that spiked the flavor-o-meter into head-explosion territory.

The gnocchi were also top-notch.  I can't lie - I dipped my finger in the bowl and licked some sauce long after the gnocchi were depleted.  Ditto for the crab dip, which wasn't heavy or gross or cheese-melty.

The house salad was also super good, though not very memorable in the face of everything else.

The complimentary black bean hummus: fantastic, as others noted.  Tasted fresh, not like it had been sitting in a vat.

Service and atmosphere were low-key but classy.  Appropriate for a resort.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food here.  I went with my family and a guest from out of town and 3 out of 4 people really enjoyed the food.  

At Koisin, they start out by giving you a pumpernickel rye bread that is very tasty.  While the chicken tortilla soup was decent, the salads were a definite improvement.  For entrees, two people had the shortribs and gnocci and they both really enjoyed it.  I had the mesquite fillet, which was very tender-it was excellent.  

My father had a steak.  He did not want the gorgonzola crust or any seasoning on it yet then complained that it was plain.  Well I tasted it and thought it was very good.  The duck fat potatoes served with the steak were excellent as well.

For dessert, we shared the corn dusted churros.  They were fantastic.  They came with two sauces, a goat milk caramel sauce and a vanilla mesquite sauce.

Very good meal overall."}
{"text":"We stayed at Wild Horse Pass right after our wedding and made a reservation here for our first dinner. All the staff knew about our special occasion and we were treated so nicely! The food was delicious, cooked perfectly, and were great flavors. We started out with the Desert Bistro wedge, my husband had the Beef Bourguignon (which he was nervous about because he did know what exactly he was getting, but it was so good!), and I had the Wood Roasted Salmon (which was cooked perfectly!) Overall, we had a great time, and we really appreciated the special treatment we were given. We will definitely be back again because the waiter told us the menu items change seasonally so we would love to try some other things. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I recommend coming here for dinner then having drinks out by the lobby bar fire."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I went this past Sunday and I can't wait to go back. We had the sea bass and the bacon rapped meatloaf with rainbow carrots. Both were exceptional! We also started with a split Caesar salad... it was huge, even split, and amazing; honestly one of the best Caesars I've ever had. My favorite part of the meal, which is saying a lot because it was one of the best meals I've had in years, was the wine. I was so excited because they have Peju savignon blanc on their menu. It is one of my favorites wines and it is not easy to find. Thank you for the amazing Valentine's Day dinner! P.S. they accept the passport discount card and it's buy one, get one entrees."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast buffet. A little pricey but this is a hotel restaurant. Had plenty of choices, from toast, to chipotle bisquits and gravy. With orange juice refills, it was worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Ko'Sin for restaurant week. The resort is located in a remote area off of 202 & 10 - the location/setting is solid, that's for sure. Knowing this, I requested  a table with a view as I made the reservation. The restaurant was more or less empty when we were sat. A few minutes later, an older couple exuding wealth and affluence walked in and were sat right next to us, directly in front of the window. \"Best seat in the house - enjoy,\" remarked the hostess. Gee, thanks.
 
The selections were decent, but nothing amazing - we had the salmon and gnocchi, and they were both mediocre. Nothing special, quite bland to be more specific. Same with the appetizers. What was amazing, however, was the \"Elvis\" - this was a treat: Peanut Butter Blondie/ Roasted Banana Ice Cream/ Milk Chocolate with Crispy Bacon Shards. I figured I might as well honor the namesake and lick the plate clean, which I did, minus the yellow paint that seemed to have been sprayed on with some fancy confectioners air brush (no idea if such thing exists - making it up). I really hope this becomes a permanent fixture on the menu, because I'd totally go back just to have it again.
 
During the course of the meal - one of the servers spilled a drink on me. I was wearing a white shirt. He apologized profusely, and grabbed me a towel to dry myself off. I wasn't expecting a handout or some kind of a comp. considering the menu is already set quite reasonably, but I was surprised that I wasn't even offered one. When I dine at finer establishments, I'm normally offered free dry cleaning or an appetizer/drink of choice. Not the case. I don't think the server even elevated the issue to anyone - am I weird for having expected a customary table touch?

May return to check out the resort for a weekend, but I will not be returning to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a nice dinner and were surprised to be seated in the lobby. Apparantly they were remodeling the restaurant. They sat us right by the window and we were literally cooking sitting there with 100 degrees up against our backs. I  Asked to move us and they sat us in the bar area in lounge type chairs and low tables.. Luckily by the time out food arrived I asked if it was possible to move to a real table and they were accommodating... Our waitress was very nice and patient and understood our frustrations... The food was OK at best, the strawberry shortcake was VERY good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"How can Kai do it so right upstairs and Kosin do it so wrong?  The mac and cheese and short rib were awesome but the salads, salmon, and service were so bad.  We have been to Kai and loved it so many times and always thought we should try Kosin.  Never again.  It's unreal the difference between the two restaurants.  Seriously the service was horrendous.  Have you no idea how to clear a plate, bring new silverware, refresh drinks, bring the app before the salad, etc?  We couldn't even get water for 20 minutes.  Is this real life?  It's a 1 star experience for the money if you don't order the mac and cheese and short rib."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was typical breakfast offering. Had some unique things
-smoked whitefish being one of them. But had all the necessary items, Oatmeal, eggs made to order, etc..

My only gripe about the breakfast buffet was the fruit selection. It was very poor
-melons and pineapple were the extent of the fruit available. No berries of any sort, just cantaloupe and pineapple. 

Lunch selections was a little better but need more fresh fruits and veggies on their menus."}
{"text":"We decided to come here after reading glowing reviews on Yelp and other review sites.  I was excited about the style of food using local ingredients and drawing on the influences of the Pima and Maricopa Indian culture of the land on which the resort is situated.  My overall impression of the restaurant was that it was good, but not good enough for the price we paid for our food.  

The flatbread/crackers and spicy black bean hummus served in lieu of bread was outstanding.  Truly delicious.  My husband ordered the Native Onion Soup and I ordered a salad with endive, arugula, goat cheese, candied walnuts and prosciutto.  The soup was a classic French Onion soup recipe, but made with a mix of local onions.   The salad was very large (which I guess was good, considering the $10 price tag), and it was pretty good, although heavy on the greens and prosciutto and light on the cheese and walnuts (my favorite parts.)  My husband ordered the buffalo steak which was served with spinach and mashed potatoes.  I ordered the pan-seared salmon with polenta and broccolini.  The buffalo steak was tender.  It was heavy on the mesquite flavoring, probably to cover up the stronger flavor of the buffalo meat.  Overall it was very good.  My salmon was a tad overcooked and honestly was nothing that I couldn't prepare at home.  I've had much better salmon.  The broccolini was a little too crisp for my taste, so I couldn't chew it.  I did really enjoy the polenta, however.

The setting is beautiful.  The resort is situated on gorgeous land and we were eating right at sunset.  The service was attentive.  (We were one of only two tables in the restaurant at the time.)  The food was presented well and tasted good for the most part, but our bill of $100 (without drinks) was far too steep for the food.  We did feel that the setting, environment and service was worth some of the price tag and we are glad we experienced it at least once."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times.  Most of the time it is very good and some dishes are spectacular. However they drop the ball a little too often, both in service and food.

The buffalo tartar is absolutely fantastic, you should go here just for that!"}
{"text":"Brunch was not very good however I am comparing it with some of the best brunches in the valley, T Cooks at the Royal Palms is about the same price and amazing.   However I expected more from Ko Sin because I've eaten at the restaurant just above, Kai, which was outstanding.   Ko Sin is decent brunch buffet for the price but a let down with high expectations I had.  Do not expect anything like their restaurant upstairs.  $20 per adult,  $10 per child.  Make the drive to Royal Palms in Phoenix...."}
{"text":"Took my wife for our anniversery and I'm glad I chose Ko'Sin. I'll be the 1st to tell you I've not been exposed to the finer things so to me this place felt like a Michelin star resturant. 

The place was beautiful, great colors, relaxed feel, great view of a sun soaked golf course. Had a rustic chic thing going on, really nice.

We started with the smoked meats and cheese appetizer,  it was stupendous.  I ordered a rare filet mignon with the horseradish mash potatoes and 5 cheese creamed spinach.  The filet was 1 1/2 inch thick and just melted in my mouth. My wife ordered the herb roasted chicken beast with duck fat sautéed brussle sprouts that were to die for. For desert i had the strawberry shortcake and vanilla ice cream while my wife ordered the way to big chocolate cake with berries. Both were divine.

I was slightly worried because of a number of negative Yelp reviews but I could not have been more pleased. The waiter was the best. Super nice, very helpful and very available. Nothing is worse than having to flag down your waiter for more water, not the case here. My glass never ran dry. Big thumbs up, made the right choice for my anniversary."}
{"text":"Your options are limited at this resort -- you are kind of far from everything so their restaurants are what you've got. So, we went here for breakfast and lunch when we stayed at the hotel. 
For breakfast we were tempted by the $30 tasting menu.  I wish we would have gotten that or the cinnamon bun french toast. Instead we got the buffet.  We were hungry, it looked pretty decent as far as buffets go, and the price was reasonable ($12 compared to their normal $17).  It was only OK. 
For lunch, I had the chicken salad. It was a great concept - avocado mousse instead of mayo. It was pretty bland though.  Husband got the chicken sandwich.  That was  very good."}
{"text":"Liked the food but the dinning room was pretty uncomfortable.  I didnt see any seating  in the whole place that looked like it would have been an improvement so we kept our table close to the kitchen.  Its upscale and decorated accordingly, but its nether romantic or welcoming.  I'm not even sure that this space was meant to be used as a restaurant dinning room.

My Husband and I had dinner and dessert here on Valentines day...The salad was interesting as well as tasty and my Ahi was very good served on a bed of greens with a nice avocado sauce and other veggies.  My husband was a little disappointed with his steak, not the flavor or preparation, just the size (theres no way it was even 4oz) pretty small for the price.

All and all there are plenty of better places to dine in the valley that are more convenient to get to and a better meal for your money.  We wont be going back."}
{"text":"I dined here twice while staying at the resort, two different experiences which is why I gave three stars instead of a 1 and a 5. 

First time I dined here it was horrid. Had to ask twice for a wine menu, didnt really get too decent of service period, let alone that I waited over an hour just to get my food .... and the malbec that I ordered was opened table side so it wasn't even properly aerated. Nit picky? Sure. But when you pay $15 for a glass of wine you expect them to do it right.

I did call and complain about that to the manager. 

The next night was a complete change and while I am sure that it had to do with my complaint, but if they could always be so attentive and friendly and courteous then I imagine half these sub par reviews wouldn't be an issue. 

Would I go again? Meh, maybe. Not based off my first visit, but definitely off my second visit for sure."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton Grand Wild Horse Pass this past Saturday night and enjoyed dinner and breakfast at Ko'sin during our stay.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, the tile wall upon entry is absolutely stunning (we were still talking about it a few days later), the restaurant was comfortable, and the food was beautifully presented and quite tasty.  For dinner, we enjoyed the tortilla soup (so delicious) and I had the pork entree (beautiful presentation, but not as flavorful as I was expecting).  For breakfast, I had two eggs with bacon, potatoes and sourdough toast - nice breakfast, but nothing out of the ordinary.  This restaurant is probably more 3 1/2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best meals of my life. The buttermilk fried chicken, greens, and pork-belly cornbread was out of this world! Feeling like I didn't want the meal to end, the hubby and I shared a massive slice of the corn cheesecake. Unbelievable! This restaurant is not to be missed. The staff is wonderful, knowledgeable about the food and courteous. Ask for Robert C. An overall amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I always have breakfast here whenever I'm staying at the Wild Horse Pass Resort. I've tried some of their other breakfast dishes but my favorite is the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"WOW.

Wow, wow, wow. 

Not only did I have the best fish tacos here, but the service was fantastic. And for a native Seattleite to compliment a seafood dish in the southwest??? Unheard of.

It was Californian halibut, and served with goat cheese (a unique combination I never would have thought of) on the tastiest mini corn tortillas. Throw in that the fish was seared and then grilled, and the plate is served deconstructed, so you assemble each delectable bite yourself....Mmm!

Our waitress (also, impressively a Seattle native) was sociable, funny, and completely on top of things.

And the table by the window, looking out to the hotel's pool, golf course, and distant mountains was gorgeous.

I couldn't have been more happy with my lunch here."}
{"text":"Really great food but server Mark was amazing. Really dud a great job ensuring I didn't get anything that i was allergic to and was very personable. Really enjoyed our dinner"}
{"text":"The family and I went here for Christmas dinner (instead of cooking- it was a nice change).  The hotel itself is beautiful- though the floor is a rustic faux flagstone (slightly uneven in many places), so be warned if you decide to wear stilletoes (I did. bad call)

The restaurant is quiet and quaint. It overlooks the pool and grounds, which are quite beautiful. 

The food here is really fantastic. I had a seafood paella, which was perfectly seasoned, and had a ton of delicious and perfectly cooked lobster, scallops, and shrimp. The service was excellent. And dessert was amazing.

Overall I am a fan of this restaurant, though it's not somewhere I'll be going regularly, as it is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Meh.
For the prices charged, the food doesn't live up.
I found the food to be good/decent, but certainly not for the $25-$35 per plate charged.

My chicken wrapped in proscuitto and stuffed with cheese was good.  Properly cooked.  A bit creative.  But $25 worth?
Hellllllllllllll no.
$12 would be more like it.

The ambiance of this place is super weird too.

Great service though!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was amazing. From the moment I walked in to my waiter (William) to the food runners everyone was SUPER nice and attentive. The wine list needs improvement but other than that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers an array of American style food with a Native American twist.  The atmosphere is rather quiet with a kitschy sound flute in the back ground to reiterate the Native American atmosphere.  One minor point worth noting, each time that I have visited here a stray sparrow is flying in and out of the restaurant.  Not a big deal for me, but if you have a fear of birds, or have seen one too many Alfred Hitchcock movie be aware!

The food is tasty and has an eclectic edge.  I had the buffalo meatloaf that included ground buffalo meat, a tomato base with seasoning wrapped in bacon.  It was accompanied with vegetables and mashed potatoes - a nice ensemble.  

The portions are reasonable and the servers are friendly.

Others in my party ordered fish tacos, hamburger, a Klub sandwich (which was enormous even for me), a Nicoise salad and tortilla soup.  Nobody left hungry.

The breakfasts are equally as filling, but the same price as lunch which is too pricey.  

The service could have been better.  The wait for the meal is on or about 20 minutes for lunch and about 15 minutes for breakfast.  Expect to pay at least $20 per head with tip.

The prices are someone higher that I feel is fair market.  However, it is worth check this place out."}
{"text":"Walked in at sunset to the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort ... just beautiful.

The place just oozes relaxation, best Chi we have experienced at any of the local Indian Reservations. Unlike most of the other Rez's in town, this tribe has the vibe!
You must experience this for yourself.

I rarely ever bring up service in my reviews but today I must highlight the downside to an otherwise excellent experience. Typical and I mean \"typical\" Sheraton resort service, high on the cleanliness and pathetic on the people management. All the employee's were kids, no doubt because adults will not work for the wages they pay and/or put up with their corporate BS. Walked out to the \"all lite up\" pool bar and were informed by 10 laughing an giggling child employee's they were already closed. All-Righty-Then. Strike 1.

Walked up to the pathetic 6 chair excuse of a lobby bar and with one look at the bartender's prowess knew cocktails where out of the question. OK we'll take a round of Four Peak's Kiltlifter Drafts. \"Oh, the drafts have not worked in a couple of days, its all foam, but I will try it for you one more time. Oh, still foam.\" (Amazingly this Ground Hog Day conversation repeated itself with several other patrons as the night progressed.) Strike 2.

Ok then, forget the sunset drinks lets head straight into Ko'Sin. Sorry the child hostess says, reading from her cue card, at the moment we are \"fully committed\".  As we stare into an half empty Saturday night dining room. Strike 3.

Calming down my posse, I decide to reset the circuit breaker and we re-group for bottled beer and the waning sunset from the beautiful atrium. I however keep checking with the Hostess, 8:00 no not yet, 8:15 still no, 8:25 no,  finally getting a group consensus from the now 3 young robots behind the counter, that our reservation was not until 8:30. Finally exactly at 8:30 the Piper at the Gates of Dawn leads us into ... the now ... completely empty dining room. 

Corporate BS OFF ..... Review ON!

We start out with a kick ass round of top shelf Margarita's, amazing and I mean amazing. Roasted limes, fresh squeeze juice, agave, dark Patron, Grand Marnier mixed to perfection. Nice ... and strong!

Well buzzed on just one drink we move on to appetizers & salads. Lots of sharing, loads of flavor. All fresh and local ingredients \"as advertised\" ... and the main reason we drove all the way out to experience Ko'sin. Service was excellent and everything flowed like clockwork. 

While the main entree choices appeared limited on the menu,  when the entree's hit the table \"all at one time\" it truly looked like a banquet.  No kidding, it really had a \"wow factor\". Beautiful presentation, colors, aroma's, and spot on delivery. Color me impressed. 

All the entree's tasted awesome, everyone sharing, everyone on there second Margarita. Fresh mahi-mahi build your own Taco's, killer Indian Fry Bread, the beef filet & pork chop where from local farmers which had a very unique fresh and natural flavor that I've never experienced before. No doubt many of the ingredients trickle down from their \"hi-end\" sister restaurant Kai upstairs. Two Thumbs Up!

Rolling back into the atrium we were met with live music from an amazing solo guitarist. The sound quality and beauty of the atrium is truly impressive, just awesome acoustics. My hat's off to the Architect! To bad the pathetic little bar does not match the grandness of the atrium. While we all wanted to stay and play,  there was no way we were going loose our buzz waiting for that service. Off to the Casino........

Unfortunately the Ko'sin restaurant is located within the confines of a corporate influenced landscape. Lucky for them I don't bring service into my ratings. (I'm all about the food) I applaud Ko'sin for their \"fresh & local\" food theme, sadly missing at most of the valley restaurants. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food served, I for one will return, but with the lessons learned from this experience. 


Valet park 
Skip the Atrium Bar
Arrive just in time for your 8:30 reservation.
Enjoy the awesome food & service.
Leave immediately & Valet park at the Casino 3 miles down the road."}
{"text":"It's pains me to give Ko'sin two stars but that only means I've experienced better.

I picked the Chicken breast dinner.

The Chicken was DRY!

The fingerling potato hash didn't seem like fingerling's or potato hash and was ORANGE and pureed with HARD CHUNKS in it. 

The mushroom fondue WAS THICK AS PUDDING and had a RING of melted BUTTER around it. This fondue was heavy with lots of flour butter and cream tasted like ultra thick salty cream of mushroom soup.

My husband ordered the pork porterhouse medium rare but it came out Almost Well Done.

His fingerling potato coins were hard and under cooked.

We were checked on after we were finished.

At the price point two stars is accurate. 

Ko'sin is a distance from the Wildhorse, a shuttle bus runs about every fifteen minutes  and it is approximately a seven minute ride to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the resort and we got a great table looking out at the beautiful landscape & pool area. 

We went for Mother's Day weekend -Saturday. I was told when I made the reservation that they had a brunch buffet on Saturday.  Turned out they had cancelled that. Had an 11:00 reservation and was given breakfast menus, by the time we ordered though they told us breakfast was over but they would accommodate our order......

Somehow the communication broke down BUT we had a perfectly prepared, delicious  breakfast with great service and a beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Come! Food was beyond fantastic for the price. Food does take a while to come but they give you bread. Our server forgot our app irised but in the end that's better. The portions were enough. Unique flavors and good combinations. I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon, dinner was mediocre, especially for the price charged. I ordered the Wamictha with frybread. The fry bread was thick and dry, and the refried beans were quite possibly straight from the can. My date got the steak which was pretty good. The horseradish mashed potatoes had just the right amount of kick. 
Service was great, everyone made sure we were well taken care of with a smile. Nice peaceful atmosphere, we were able to eat our dinner in peace. Probably won't return, the valve of the food is far less than what we paid for it."}
{"text":"What's the Deal? (why the rating)
This is the first time we had been there. The place is good but the food was not very unique, the ambiance is not - well anything, and the service was barely average. Why you ask. Let me tell you...

Bang for the Buck: 2/5
- I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes, just as high quality food and good service. 

Decor: 2/5
- nothing special. It is a restaurant in a golf resort... it looks and acts like it. 

Ambiance: 3/5
- Small brightly lit room with high ceilings and with a few tables. Not crowded but not private or unique. There were tables outside which would have been great since it was a nice night and it was very quiet out there, but they did not seat anyone there, nor did they offer to.

Service: 5/5
- very friendly and accommodating. I was not happy that as more people showed up our server, who was providing excellent service, dissapeared for long periods of time. We did not get our wine with dinner and the guy that served our meals did not know we ordered wine. They did take care of it. Our steaks were also overcooked a bit. It was a great cut of meat and we ordered medium rare, they came medium. The server did reduce the bill to compensate, which was appropriate - and nice.

Food Quality: 5/5
- very good quality. everything we had was excellent

Food Quantity: 3/5
- maybe a bit under average portions for the price, though it is a resort so they are taking advantage of that I'm sure.

Food Uniqueness & Creativity: 5/5
- get the items that look unique, you will enjoy them.

Food Flavor: 5/5
- they do very well in this area. all items we had were excellent.

Last Experience...

We went for the $40 Restaurant Week menu. They offered a 3 glass wine paring with the 3 course meals for an extra $15 - we did this also.

black bean hummus with flat bread - SUPERB. The flatbread crackers were also excellent and had a bit of spice.

Peppercorn Crusted Petit Filet Mignon: Local Infused Bernaise Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes & Iitoi Onions, Broccolini
- 3/5, tender and very smooth flavor. Nothing special

Local Farmer's Ratatouille (MUST get!)
- 6/5, yes, really!
- pan seared Mole Crusted Tofu was fantastic, and I don't like tofu. A standout dish. Great flavors, complex, and left me wanting more. I'd go back for this.

Oven Roasted Game Hen (amazing!)
- 6/5, yes, really!
- Lavender & Red Inca Quinoa with Dried Stone Fruit, Wild Mushroom Reduction, Pickled Pineapple.
- The delicate flavors worked so well together. Every bite was juicy and a soothingly delicious. 

Arizona Style Cheesecake: With Mesquite Fennel Pollen Crust
- 3/5, just cheesecake. good cheesecake but nothing special. Maybe sprinkle the same crust bits all over to allow it to add more unique flavor?

Local Citrus Brulee: With lingonberry compote
- 1/5, too much citrus for my taste. everyone at the table thought so also"}
{"text":"Our first night in for the conference, we dined here.  I was excited that they appeared to have lean food on the menu. I ordered the sea bass with quinoa and  green beans. Well, it was overdone and the strongest flavor was salt.  Yuck. But the service was great.  It sounded better in theory than it was executed."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my daughter for her 21st birthday.  I asked for a window table with a view, which they obliged.  We watched the people romping at the pool as the sun set.  Peaceful and serene, as is the ambiance of the whole resort.  The service was superb with Jose and I can't remember the woman who filled our water glasses and whisked away dirty dishes.  They started us on their complimentary black bean hummus and large crackers.  Sorry.  I can't remember the name of it.  Both were great and we almost filled up on those before the dinner came.  I ordered the fillet mignon and my daughter the new york strip.  Mine was perfect.  It came on a bed of mashed potatoes and steamed spinach.  It was moist and perfectly seasoned.  I am not usually a meat eater, eating a hunk of meat maybe twice a year.  I'm glad this was the hunk that I chose for the year!  My daughter's ny strip was seasoned with something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it was good as well.  Her steak came with finger potatoes and a side of creamed corn.  It was barely creamy, which I didn't try since I'm not a fan of creamed corn.  Her potatoes were good as well, but I'm a fan of mashed potatoes.  It was topped off with their dessert of pretzel bread pudding.  YUMMMMM!!  I was stuffed from the appetizers and dinner, but I took one bite of the dessert and we both finished that as well.  I'd definitely  return."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch and the wait was very long. My food came out wrong and while they did correct it, everyone else in my dining party was nearly done by the time it arrived. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Limited menu if you do not eat meat- there is not one vegetarian option on the lunch or dinner menu - and they act like it is an odd question when you ask what they can offer as a vegetarian meal. Telling you to order the side vegetables is not very accommodating ."}
{"text":"Service was terrific, and the lamb osso bucco was fabulous.  Very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Not even a hint of the great restaurant Kai two stories above. Overpriced and undergood. $32 salmon was dry as a bone. $38 pork chop came on a giant pile of \"60 day cornbread\" that was certainly dry enough to have been made that long ago."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant in Wild Horse Pass (Sheraton). I dined here for my birthday dinner and I had lunch here as well the next day.

Food was delicious and cooked perfectly. I had a bacon sandwich for lunch and the steak for dinner. Delightful portions. Steak was not 5 star quality but was not too bad. Cooked well but a little under marinated.

Service is excellent and fast. Definitely a dining option when you visit the resort."}
{"text":"I made reservations and left copious borderline O.C.D. instructions for my parent's 50th Anniversary at Ko'sin all remotely via the phone and internet sight unseen utilizing all our wonderful modern technology and despite all this, the ladies and gents all along the long chain of communication at Wild Horse Pass still managed to nail every detail. The only error was a slight gift card delay glitch (mechanical of course - damn computers!). The professionals at this restaurant  once again illustrate clearly that the human touch is what rules and that The Terminators must only be utilized for our benevolent pursuits...of course.

Huge kudos to server Mark for impeccable service, manager Jason for creating such a beautiful environment for my parents to enjoy and the pastry department for the gratis anniversary dessert and thoughtful decoration. Oh, the hostess who helped me out earlier in the day was a sweetheart too and everyone in the restaurant deserves a huge sloppy kiss on the cheek from me  (but I'll spare you the agonizing bliss of that experience and just let you imagine it).

BTW, I believe the word Ko'sin is also Pima for Classiest restaurant in the West.
Thank you sincerely."}
{"text":"Ko'sin is the less expensive restaurant at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. Probably 3 and 1/2 stars.
It has an interesting menu influenced by native american cuisine, spices and herbs.

We Tried
Black bean hummus and crackers: It is a great hummus. Black beans are blended with the chickpeas. The hummus is chunky but smooth to the palate. The seasoning is perfect. It is a great combo when spread over the large cracker tiles. I love it.

Native onions soup not your typical onion soup. The broth was flavorful an spicy bit not too salty. The cheese was layered on a piece of bread and was not too much. The different variety of onions gave a terrific flavor to the soup. 

Kitchen salad: It was a simple but good house salad with tomatoes, cuccumbers, and mixed lettuce.

Cigar Style Quesadillas: It has cactus, corn, pepper, beans as sides. The quesadillas are rolled in cigar shaped and breaded with corn ships and native american seasoning. It is crunchy on the outside but the chicken is tender and moist in the inside. Too bad, process american liquid cheese was drizzled on top or it would have been a great dish ( but heavy..)

As Ko'sin is inside the resort the prices are above what you would pay for them outside. But the quality and the customer care are both excellent.

The native american music in the background is nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner after buying a Groupon. I was a little concerned because of the negative reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised! 

   The staff is very nice, very accommodating,  and always nearby when needed. Our waiter, José,  was awesome! 
 
  The complimentary black bean and chipotle hummus is sooooo good! We started with the aged meat and cheese plate. Everything was delicious. I ordered the herb roasted chicken with duck fat sautéed Brussels sprouts and wild mushrooms. Wow! The skin on the chicken was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. The vegetables were addictive. I could have eaten a plate full of them! My husband ordered the filet mignon with horseradish potato puree and 5 cheese creamed spinach. The filet could have been cut with a fork. It was cooked just right. We ended the meal with dessert. My husband got the strawberry shortcake with vanilla bean ice cream. Delish! I got their humongous chocolate cake. It was decadent and I ended up bringing half of it home, it was so big!

   If our budget ever allows, I'd love to come back and eat again. 

  The ONLY gripe I have is that the seating isn't very comfortable. The atmosphere is nice and the views are beautiful, but the chairs are uncomfortable. Small matter since everything else was fantastic."}
{"text":"Bread is nice and fresh
Sea Bass with Red Inca Quinoa, Toasted Almonds, Petite Green Beans, Meyer Lemon Butter Sauce - It wasn't all that. Service was really good"}
{"text":"Really not sure but since I cannot give 1/2 stars I rated them with two stars. Service started out okay, but felt like we were slighted after we started off on the wrong foot as it seems. We had been given a groupon as a gift, so was determined to chill and enjoy a nice meal and forgive some of the things I would normally hold a restaurant accountable for. Well, that wasn't the case; after calling 3 times to attempt to make a reservation - I was told all three times none needed. The first thing I was asked by the hostess was, \"I'll let you guess!\" You're right \"DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION?\" Service was barely given, had to almost beg for refill on Tea, food lacked flavor, the shrimp were tough, pricey for the portion, SALAD WAS GOOD! Desert was good! Guest next to us upset because they'd driven quite a distance to learn that the restaurant was closed for remodel, but was serving in the lobby of the hotel.
Lot of reviews out there for these guys, I'd only return if I was in a group and that is where they want to go.
Always worth a shot, you may have a better experience, I'd only hope!!"}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday brunch buffet and found it to be delicious. Everything you would look for at a breakfast buffet in a hotel. Fresh squeezed juices, eggs cooked to order, real maple syrup for the pancakes, awesome chorizo sausage gravy, thick slices of bacon, mountains of fresh fruit and baskets of croissants and muffins. It was our anniversary during our visit and they comped one our meals on this visit. Worth going if you're staying at the hotel, food is great. We got a really cozy booth in the middle of the room. Service was fine. Coffee was good. Carol C. got a USA Today which she enjoyed a lot. What else can you ask? Nice work Ko'sin."}
{"text":"Service was average at best.

The food was medicore to good.  The short rib was great, the sides were not.  The crab dip was good, the bread was not.  The chicken was bad, the sides were good.  You see where I'm going with this...

The value is tremendously bad.  I know it's a hotel but you can't price the average food as 5-star gourmet.  I utilized a deal that was aimed at drawing locals to the hotel.  I had a decent meal but I certainly wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and was blown away by the quality and variety of choices! They have an omelet station where a staff member cooks your omelet exactly as you'd like it with all the ingredients you love. There are plenty of delicious pancakes and trays of other staple breakfast items including scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and sausage. They have toast and bagels with the option of adding prickly pear jam! But the star of the show for me was the blackberry passion fruit juice. Talk about a nice tropical taste to close out a meal in a desert oasis! I can't wait to return on my next staycation!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant inside a hotel, it's pretty good. I've been twice for breakfast and twice for lunch. 
Shrimp tacos were the highlight by far. Stuffed full and just amazing. They were a bit messy just FYI. 
Eggs and potatoes were good. Pretty standard minus just a taste more of freshness. 
Outdoor seating is a plus. But the birds and flies kind of get in the way but that's part of nature. 
The potato soup got good reviews. So did the kale salad. Fresh fruit was just what it says. 
Service was always good which pushes this from 3 to 4 stars. 
You can charge to your room if you're staying at the Sheraton. Or put it on a card."}
{"text":"I came here for Mother's Day Brunch. The food was fantastic and my mom and grandma were very excited. I've been to Kai before and was hoping they'd be open for brunch, but sadly they weren't. 

It was $65/person for brunch - pricey for a 4 course meal. It wasn't your standard Mother's Day Brunch buffet but was really good food. I have no complaints about the food at all - I think it was amazing. My only issue is the vibe felt off - it didn't feel like the ambiance of the place matched how much I was paying for brunch. The servers weren't the most knowledgeable about the food...he recommended queso fresco for my grandma's filet because she doesn't like goat cheese. queso fresco?! NO. He was nice, don't get me wrong. But if I'm about to drop $400 on brunch, I want someone with some knowledge. Also, we went for awhile without refills on water or tea. That's annoying. Those are the major reasons I deducted a star because otherwise the food was really good. The presentation was gorgeous. I'll upload the pics. I def took a lot. 

Overall, I wouldn't come to Ko'Sin. I'd rather just spend the money and go to Kai where the servers are super knowledgeable and the ambiance feels more upscale...the pricing matches. I'm not articulating myself well. Here's an example, say you walk into a diner and you pay $20 for a burger. While it's still a great burger and definitely probably worth the $20, you still feel like you overpaid just because you're in a diner. I hope that makes more sense."}
{"text":"Went there for my husband's birthday. Very nice atmosphere with genuine and attentive staff members. The food was very good. We started with a salad, which was wonderful, then my husband had the trout and I had the roasted chicken both of which were great. Our kid loved his cheeseburger and fries and he finished off his meal with a homemade vanilla ice cream sundae with chocolate (so good!). We celebrated with the goat cheesecake with blackberry sauce and homemade whipped cream-delicious! We most certainly will be back here again. Thank you Justin and Brandon for such a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Service, Service Service!  This place gets five stars on service alone.  They could serve hot dogs and I'd be happy, however the food is awesome too.  I've been to some high end restaurants where service hasn't even come close to the exceptional staff of Ko'Sin.  The food was great, selection good, and overall quality is spot on. Mostly though, it's the wonderful folks that work there who provide a great experience.  I travel often for work and have many choices for where I'll stay.  It's the great staff of the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass and Ko'Sin that make my stay so enjoyable.  I actually look forward to work travel.  Thank you Ko'Sin and Sheraton Staff!  Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"They where in the middle of a construction renovation so the atmosphere was a little off. Food was excellent and staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Flies, slow service, rude hostess and flies. Good atmosphere but bad management... apparently!"}
{"text":"Why sit us by the window in a small area at night...? There's no lights outside! :)

Being so close to Kai which is also located at the Wild Horse Pass, I figured this would be a pretty much \"win\" situation; don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I've had better. Since it is located so far outside of civilization, the walk to the restaurant was an episode of my girlfriend being chased by bugs. Once we got in, the atmosphere was pretty nice, a little over-the-top Native American decor, but it's expected at a higher end restaurant/resort.

The seating was not my ideal choice: right next to the patio window... which would have been fine if there were some lights outside or if it was daytime. I'm assuming that even if there were lights, they probably didn't want to turn them on since it would just be a show of gnats and mosquitoes flying aimlessly at the brightness. The seats were not very comfortable and the table was rather small; even for the two of us, it seemed insufficient.

The food on the other hand, was much better. I ordered the giant scallops which was an excellent portion and the quality was top notch. The browned scallops rested upon a bed of steamed Bok Choy cabbage followed by a light sprinkle of bacon squares surrounded by a light vinaigrette for a little extra kick of flavor. Definitely try it if you like bacon and scallops! :)

Service was fantastic as you would expect from a higher end restaurant, but the price was a little steep for the overall dining experience; not to mention the full bar with the loud morons was quite annoying. - Cheers"}
{"text":"Buffalo was very yummy. We split a meal and salad. We had very good wine service and we had a head waiter and a water helper which was acommidating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast after an early horseback riding outing. I ordered the poached eggs in a crisp tortilla shell (their version of Eggs Benedict). I don't know if I can go back to classic Eggs Benedict after that... My only complaint is that the coffee was lukewarm. Otherwise, everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Great service for a birthday dinner. William made the evening very special and we really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Very non sustainable menu. 26 bucks for a bowl of \"native\" granola and a smoothie to your room... Won't sell you a smoothie after breakfast unless you are dropping serious coin on dinner which is total bs because the smoothie is the ONLY good mixer for a cocktail on the whole resort property besides soda water. You want an awesome frozen drink poolside? Plan on shoveling tons of GMO corn syrup down your gullet and wait till you see the nasty cream film that sticks to your cup when you are done drinking it... Those are 10 bucks each.... It's a shame because this resort is so deluxe but all the food is soooo schwaggy. My granola which was about the only thing a non-flesh eater could eat was served to me w/ warm soy milk....... both times I got it(and I asked for it cold the second time!!!! Nobody likes warm milk in granola!!! Especially for these prices!!!!l"}
{"text":"We had dinner here and breakfast the next morning as well. The dinner was absolutely amazing - fresh unique ingredients and expert service. I cannot express how delicious that steak was - Thank you so much for a truly memorable meal. Breakfast the next morning at the buffet was also quite good. You cannot walk away from this place hungry, that's for sure. Breakfast or dinner - YUMMMY!"}
