{"text":"Will not be returning! The food choices are very limited and the quesadilla I ordered came out with hardly anything inside. Basically two tortillas. The service was also very slow. So many better places in Charlotte, any bar has had better food than this place.  Also if you have been to the Tin Kitchen food truck and had awesome food, this is not the restaurant version of the food truck! No association."}
{"text":"I went to this location twice this week. My first time the server was amazing and I liked my quesadilla so much that me and my boyfriend decided to go back. But I will never go back again. The bartender was awful and if you're in the area or just the epicenter I suggest any other bar or restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited over 1 1-2 hours for our food then waitress said \"we have a small kitchen, deal with it\". Unbelievable. Worst Resturant experience I have ever had. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"How amazing to find a place open on Christmas! Despite being understaffed the service was great! The rodeo burger was delicious - would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with co workers. We were greeted promptly as we walked through the doors. Waitress was really sweet an able to explain the menu. Food was a little better than average. Manager also walked up to ask how we were doing. If they keep up this attitude, they'll be one of the hottest places in town to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time on this one. Go to ANY other restaurant in epicenter. Probably the worst service I've received in years. Food was ok, not worth the wait. Each round of drinks takes about 10-15 min. I've heard good things About tin roof in other cities, they better right this ship fast or this will be closed in a few months. Also, message to management, train your staff to say \"sorry\" when they're making mistake after mistake."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place is so interesting. You order a long island and they put vodka and sour mix together with a splash of coke. I am a bartender. And I make a damn good long island. And charge 7.25 for them at the restaurant I work at. And here they chaege you $16 for two. This was garbage. And the live music isn't that good, especially when you have people walking around telling you to give them 5 bucks. F**\" this place. Waste of money. Waste of time. Tin roof, get your act together."}
{"text":"Awesome service (shout out to Jet!!), great drink specials, and plenty of TVs to watch the Wolfpack! We got the tots appetizer (it was OK) and bourbon buffalo chicken (delicious). I can't review the nightlife here 'cause we came for lunch, but I would definitely recommend coming in the day to just chill and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Don't trust the pictures of the food, the \"Tinga tacos\" are NOT tinga, mixed drinks reminded me off the TJ days of cheap drinks and nachos have two pieces of chicken with a bunch of BBQ sauce... wtf?  Don't pretend to have Mexican food."}
{"text":"My significant other and I stopped by to get a few drinks before going to a movie at the studio movie grill. The service was excellent and the Panther shots were perfect. Not too strong or too weak on the alcohol. We plan on going back to try the food soon!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food . The queso dip was excellent. Jett was a fantastic bartender, very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Stoped by the Tin Roof for the first and last time. Arrived at 2pm and my beer was served in a plastic cup. The bartender told me that they only have 12 beer glasses. We ordered some nachos. The nachos were fried in old oil. The taste was not good. And when we ask for plates... they gave us dixie plates and disposable silverware. It was a bad experience and i would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The absolute worst dining experience I have ever had. We were there for drinks and a quick bite before the Amy Schumer show. A group of six of us had come and it was seat yourself. They may have been a little short staffed but we waited at least 10 minutes before being greeted. Carson didn't introduce herself, not even a \"hi, hey how you doing?\", nothing but \"what do you want to drink?\".  The only way we know her name is because we asked who she was. After ordering our drink it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks to the table (which were horrible). We ordered food which then took almost another 40 minutes. Meanwhile, Carson was in a corner seemingly talking to a group of her friends. Never did she come visit the table, get us refills on our drinks or inform us about our food taking so long. When one member of group got curious she got up and found Carson to inquire about the food and in return got a very rude remark and an uglier attitude. Food finally arrived and we scarfed it down quickly. Asked for water when the food came and ate the entire meal and paid the bill before getting the water. Carson sent another waitress to drop the bill off and never returned to the table. Being a server myself, I was absolutely appalled by this experience and am still heated hours later. I have never been treated with such utter disrespect. I work at a corporate chain restaurant in north Charlotte that has a clientele based on the elderly and university kids who do not tip but I would never and could never treat guests as I was treated tonight. Unless you like terribly slow and rude service, please do not go there."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night after dinner and was in the mood for live music. The band playing that night was pretty darn stellar. The talent did off the cuff renditions of just about every 90s songs, some TBT rock, pop and r&b. Was very impressed with the talent. The crowd was mixed and what you'd expect for the Epicentre. I liked the Christmas lighting decor and watching people randomnly jam out to the band. Our bartender took a lot of smoke breaks and was hard to flag down every once in a while. Their beer selection was average and their wines were not my fave (sweet copa di vino Pinot Grigio - blech). Took some interesting pics while there and liked the unpretentious, grunge-like scene here. Would definitely come back just for the talent alone. Hope howl at the moon has decent talent too and like that they're both across from each other."}
{"text":"This place! So I've been 3 times in 4 days.. the live Band on Friday night was awesome. The crowd was super cool friendly laid back and good looking. And, these two bartenders Lexi and Tom were awesome.. never waited for a drink at the bar... what more can you ask for? I highly recommend it! As a traveler it's pretty much perfect.. go there."}
{"text":"Just avoid... super slow service (drinks took 25 minutes to come out). Waitress disappeared for a while and the place was empty. Food is ehh barebones basic, overpriced for what It is and they were out of several side so It was automatically replaced with fries. Expected to be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great service last night by Jet. He handled the full bar by himself and no one waited for drinks and there were 30+ people in the bar. Great music and great finishing song for the night, The Closing Song by Red Peters"}
{"text":"First Timers in Charlotte celebrating the New Year! The band was good and the service was good! We paid to get in which we expected and all 5 of us got a stamp. 2 out of the 5 are smokers. When my 2 female friends went out to smoke they were told by security that they were not allowed to go back in with out waiting in line again which of course was long due to the holiday. That's absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We went here last night before our movie to grab a drink. We didn't get any food, just drinks, so I cannot comment on the food. If we ever go there for food, I'll update my review accordingly.   The second we walked in the door, we were greeted by one of the waitresses. There were a handful of people in the restaurant but definitely not busy. My husband and I decided to grab a drink at the bar, since we were just drinking. The bartender immediately came over. I asked for the drink specials and there were TONS.....I couldn't remember half of what he said cause there was so many!!! We both just settled for $2 Rolling Rock. I don't know if I was tired or the 15 min walk into Uptown made me thirsty, but man that ice cold beer was so amazing!   Looking around, the place is super colorful and all the decorations on the walls (like old school advertisements) were entertaining. We chatted with the bartender for a bit. He said there are 15 of these restaurants around the south east.  He also said they bring out live bands every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We were there on a Thursday, and he mentioned that there is usually a DJ that does his own screen visuals (I have no clue what its called) that comes out on Thursdays.   Seems like a cool place to grab a quick cheap drink and listen to some music."}
{"text":"Hello to all of my people who read my posts.. I was so disgusted by this place that I had to write..ok so it's CIAA wknd here, and everyone is looking for a place to chill, drink..etc.. while at the epi center most of the spots are filled to the gills with people, so we wait on line to get in, after 20 min we get to the front door, I have my ID, but my boy doesnt, and he full beard of white hair, and they still would not let him come in without ID, so he's gotts run back to the car..finally gets back, and KNOW they want to charge $20 for him to come in, and all we wanted to do was grab something to eat and drink..so we clear that  mess up and walk to the bar, so we ordered wings and fries, and a couple drinks..I asked for a rum..splash of coke..so the waitress grabs two plastic cups, measures exactly 1oz of rum, and pours a splash of coke and it comes back with literally a half shot, and then has the nerve to say \"$16 for two shots??? I look at the cup..and I stare at it.. this is amazing..so I ask to speak to a mgr, and they explain this insane policy... then the food came, the fries came hot but the wings came luke warm and under cooked???. I am so upset with the customer service, with the food.. this had to be by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had..I dont know what they can do to reverse whats going  on down there.. but the place needs a complete staff make-over.. this was an EPIC failure.."}
{"text":"eh, its just a crappy bar.  Smells bad, always dirty, security and bartenders seem to always be \"doing you a favor\" by doing their jobs... watch out for the young man behind the bar with the enormous head.... he messed up our orders several times and then double charged us.   and seriously, you can't miss this guy.   His head is freakishly HUGE."}
{"text":"I had a great experience coming in early before a band started playing. We ordered a Carona and a Margarita drink which were good, the plastic cup didn't bother me because they are way to big for glass cups on a holiday evening with live music (cinco de mayo).  Everything was fine until it got busy, it became super dirty, and unattended.  They were super understaffed with a private party there before the night show on top of that.  The restrooms were terribly filthy and out of paper towels on one side, no hooks for purses so I had to put my purse on the nasty floor. When I went to the bar with my friend, she ordered a bud light and a PBR. I ordered two NoDa bears on tap.   Took us about... God I don't know... at least ten minutes if not 15 to get our drinks, then about another ten for them to fix their error, which I found out later they didn't.  The bartender switched our credit cards, he was spinning out of control literally, throwing cups behind his back and bottle caps on the floor. He was moving too fast, kept telling the group next to us to hurry up with their order.  He handed me my friends check which had an extra charge for a 2nd PBR that she didn't order, and he charged her for my two drinks.  I just got home and heard from my friend that they triple charged her card and they double charged my card for her order they got wrong the first time and then again for mine. I went today because we were hired to record the band playing, I will never go back there on a busy night, the worst experience with the actual vendor that I have had in a very long time, and we record events for a living.  Horribly managed place.  We asked them to switch the lights on over the band so we can record properly, we had to shoot silhouettes, all the lights were facing the crowd.   Just a horrible experience with the vendor, I've never had to call and speak to a manager the next day AND make sure my friend does too so she can get her money back also.   Be prepared to not have any expectations with them when you go on a busy night."}
{"text":"Never gave a one star! So it must be bad.  I would have gladly given 3 stars if me and my friend did not have food poisoning after eating here.  We both split the nachos and we did not eat anything after this. Later that night - \"it\" began. I will spare you the gory details.  It was not busy at all and yet it took a while to get service.  We enjoyed the music but that would be about it.  It will be a while before I can eat nachos again."}
{"text":"Drink specials were nice but boy was it a sauna in this place. It was hard to breathe it was so hot. We had to step outside and get fresh air. The wait at the bar was quite lengthy....onky saw one bartender. On a slow nights it a lil better, food is great, but the service isn't all that great."}
{"text":"Good wings but lousy waitress service.she forgot half our order. We are visiting from Texas"}
{"text":"Jet is this the best bartender in the Epic Center!! Tin roof has amazing food and great waitress as well!!"}
{"text":"Beer was good. Haha food was okay nothing to write home about. Service was terribly slow. One of our friends had to talk the server through what we each got at a table of 9. She talked her though this at the server station...... even after all the help she messed them up."}
{"text":"Open on snow day!  This was the first place we could find that was open in the \"Great Blizzard of Charlotte 2014\".  I was a little late to the party as I had to park when everyone else took the light rail.  It took me a second to find the place.  There are a lot of signs out front but I didn't really see one that had the name of the establishment.  The were under-staffed due to the weather but our waitress was still relatively punctual in her visits.  One great friend was nice enough to go ahead and order me a beer when they knew I was close to walking in.  So, all I had to do was decide on food.  I ate some leftover chicken tenders of others and decided that was enough to hold me off for now.  Ordered a few more drinks and watched some Olympics.  Everyone was nicely buzzed and having fun but not so much as to bother others.  I finally decided I was going to order some food.  At the same time a couple in our group asked for their check.  They got their check and they were over-charged.  They asked the waitress why their quesadilla's weren't the price as advertised on the ad on the napkin holder and she just said that they were't doing specials today.  She didn't think to say something when they both ordered quesadillas on quesadilla day?  She stood by her statement.  With a few in the party working in local establishments nobody wanted to bother the manager but we had no other option.  He came over, instantly fixed it.  No harm done.  After all that, everyone else wanted to leave, so I got no food.  I don't really get the theme here.  Country bar in the epicenter?  Will not go out of my way to visit this place again, but not completely apposed to it either.  Oh yeah, Epicenter parking is something like $5 an hour, and no one validates.  So, be prepared for that."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for a drink and appetizer before a concert.  Sat at the bar and I had to wipe it down myself, it was gross.  We ordered our drink and chips & guacamole and closed out our bill immediately. It was only after we paid that the bartender told us the kitchen was backed up and it would \"be a while\". 45 minutes later, still no chips. We got up and left.  Poor service, dirty bar, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Girl's night out to celebrate a milestone birthday and we wanted to listen to live music. This was my second time there. Overall it is just a typical bar, but I've had a great time both times I've been. I loved that it was an eclectic crowd - 20 somethings to probably 70+. The music was fun and the band got people moving and singing along. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Large outdoor area that I enjoyed! Music was great and the view if the city was awesome! While it was crowded and getting a drink took a while the music and diverse people made it enjoyable I was able to get a seat rather quickly!!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch before and I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place for daytime dining. They aren't really a restaurant and seem more like a bar. It's pretty average food nothing amazing but nothing to write home about either. We were there during a daytime sporting event and the service was really slow because they were busier than anticipated.  I have also been here at night. I went after the Miley Cyrus concert to hang out and have some drinks. It was a really fun time! Live music and lots of fun dancing. I would recommend stopping by here while out on the town. Overall fun atmosphere for nightlife but not so much for lunch."}
{"text":"Super friendly place, very clean and professional without being stuffy.  The nachos are nothing special, but definitely try the chicken waffle bites (with maple syrup and bacon crumbles on top).  Decent selection of popular beers in bottle and on draft, but don't go here looking for craft brews or microbrews.  LCD TVs over the bar for sports, live music on some nights.  Tables for groups, or you can just sit at the bar.  I'm not a bar hopper (just looking for a place to grab some beer and munchies) and I felt very welcome."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite spot until I was racially profiled tonight. I was willing to spend all night at this place until I was kicked out with my Hispanic group of friends.  We were standing at the bar then told to leave after one drink.   Obviously you need to go on the right night!"}
{"text":"Finally!! A fun place to socialize ( even if over 40!) with bartenders who take the time to welcome you and chat for a bit.  Especially enjoyed meeting \"Tom\" behind the bar. Made our 1 st visit to Charlotte a great time!"}
{"text":"My experience was great. I sat at the bar with my friends  Tom and  Scott were awesome . I'm coming back every  Tuesday. The drinks were good and fast . They both were really engaged with us even after 7 more people join our party.  I love sports and they were able to talk about everything with us . Great Tuesday Night hands down"}
{"text":"Nice live band. Awful service, I walked in, sat at the bar for 30 minutes and not once did anyone talk to me. Not coming back and definitely don't recommend it unless you want to wait forever."}
{"text":"Carson and Ryan were awesome all night! Chicken and Waffles were delicious and the Chips and Dip Sampler is huge - definitely big enough to share between friends.   First time at this place and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here it's really good and I've of the good thing that I like about this place is it close to both stadiums."}
{"text":"It appears Tin Roof changes employees as often as one would change clothes.Sometimes good because many were rude & incompetent. However, they must be blinded by NOT CHANGING MANAGEMENT.!!! For about 6 months myself & approximately 10 coworkers & friends have come there at least 2 - 3 times a week & YOUR MOST RUDEST, UNPROFESSIONAL, SO CALLED MANAGER, a Miss Yas, who always seems to be disappearing & when she finally appears she Yells at Emploees & other staff members in public while we all are trying to eat & drink comfortably. She speaks on her cell phone & screams at whoever on the phone, so everyone hears her conversation. When speaking to her she shook her head & walked away. After speaking to our server, a Miss Tori , who was excellent by the way, we asked for her bosses name & were told Angie or Bob. Angie came over & apologized & offered a free appetizer & apologized for Miss Yas & assured us she would speak to her. The next couple of times we came in & things were great & Miss Yas was not there. However, it appears Miss Yas is back continuing being rude, unprofessional & still on cell  phone screaming at whoever & crying & airing all her personal issues. When asked for Angie, we were told she no longer works there.  What a shame, the rude unprofessional manager is there & Angie moved on elsewhere. Makes you wonder why such a good manager would leave.  However, the owner of Tin Roof needs to do some house cleaning with management as he will see he is &/or will loose customers & sales in the near future. We all are choosing not to return. Thank you for 1 1/2 years of good times & good management."}
{"text":"Fun place. Cute decor with Christmas lights and a lot of seating. Bartenders are friendly and fabulous - Especially JP! Doodle your $1 bill and enjoy the show :)"}
{"text":"The worst place to go in all of Uptown, specifically in the Epicenter. First off, the service is horrendous. Staff is the biggest bunch of scumbags I have ever had the displeasure of waiting on me in a restaurant establishment. Don't waist your time or money at this disgusting place. There is WAY better places to go to in Uptown. I don't normally give bad reviews, I usually only take the time to give good reviews but I felt compelled to save someone else from a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Great music and friendly bartenders. A variety of patrons in age and culture. A great time all around"}
{"text":"Casual bar.  Only been here for drinks and live music."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews.  But I had to write one after the outstanding service I received at Tin Roof Charlotte.   The customer service could not have been better.   I visited with a few friends on a big night.   It was the night of the McGregor Mayweather fight.  Place was packed!  Not only was it a great venue to see the fight, but I felt like I was their only guest.   Whenever I needed something, they responded immediately with courtesy and went out of their way to make me feel VIP.   Let me give you specifics!  There was an issue with the ordering of the online tickets to the event.  I called the restaurant and spoke with Yasmin.  She assured me they would solve it and they did.  Not only that, she gave me her personal cell to make sure if I needed anything, I would be helped.   She made sure that night we got there ok and the other manager was so polite too.    I couldn't have asked for better service.   I'm sorry that others might have had bad experiences.  Mine was awesome.   And I'll definitely be going back for sure!   Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while on a business trip. Four of us went and the events of the night will never be told, at least by me. But I love this place. It was karaoke night and frankly I couldn't hear the people singing but the vibe was so mellow. The word \"inclusive\" comes to mind. Maybe \"mixed crowd\" is more informative. Fun, friendly crowd. Can't comment on service since my friend bought all the drinks. Decor was interesting and the restroom can only be described as eclectic. When in Charlotte, go here."}
{"text":"Tom was the best bartender I've ever had. He made drinks that were unfathomable when we had no idea what to order. Justin gave us incredible serivce as well. The music was kick ass. Honestly this was my favorite bar during my whole vacation down to Charlotte. 5 full stars"}
{"text":"we were in town this weekend for the bears vs panthers football game. the managers were not very smart scheduling 1 waitress for a sat afternoon when sooooo many people were in town from Chicago. however, our waitress OLIVIA was amazing. the food was good. the atmosphere was super fun. she got all 20 of us food n drinks. we all went back later that night and the band we saw there was great too....go there and ask for Olivia"}
{"text":"I feel bad for Tin Roof Charlotte. I've been to several of their locations and most are actually a lot of fun. Live music, awesome 'dillas, lack of clientele judgment. All my favorite things.  The charlotte location just had the awful management oversight to put it in the epicenter. This means a couple things. A. Massive space without enough people to fill it. B. Rude, bro-ish patrons that hassle the bar space and yell at bartenders for not pouring fireball shots fast enough. C. Severely lacking craft beer options. Which I get because Bros don't drink carbs.   I'll go back to Birmingham, Cincinnati and Columbia,SC in a heartbeat but I'm gonna pass on this one."}
{"text":"Don't even bother! My husband and I stood at the door (I am disabled) and after being ignored by several people who work there I asked the guy at the door :Do we seat ourselves?\" Oh, yeah, ok. My husband found us a booth since I have a hard time walking and we sat. The waitress came and I ordered a vodka martini. She replied \"We can't make martinis\". I guess I gave her a puzzled look, because she went on to say \"We don't have a glass and besides, we're very busy. So, do you still want a martini?\". I asked if I could get a Bloody Mary and she said \"Yes.'  If you're too busy to splash some vodka and olive juice in a glass how do you have time to make a Bloody Mary??  My husband ordered a beer. She seemed ok with that, like bringing a beer in a bottle wouldn't strain her too much. We got up and left before the drinks came. It is rude to tell a customer that you are too busy to make the drink she really wants! Idiots much?????"}
{"text":"Absolute worst bar staff in Charlotte. I waited 10 minutes just to be greeted on a dead night. This is definitely a novelty spot not worth visiting. It is cheesy & I will not be back."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was mediocre. Won't be back. I had the PB&B. How hard is it too screw up peanut butter and bananas? Apparently, it's very easy. To top it off, they had the music so loud that I couldn't hear my table mates talk. It wasn't crowded at all. So there was no excuse for the music to be blaring like that. And my rum and coke was 99% coke. There are much better bars uptown. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"well, I used to come every single Wednesday night (for the past year+) solely for the super fun trivia/karaoke night, which was fabulous and usually had an awesome turn out. EXTREMELY disappointed that management decided to get rid of the show, and I will be taking my Wednesday night business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Bouncers act like high school bullies... We were there last night, me and my boyfriend had both of our beers taken away from us.  They claimed we were \"too drunk\".  We were then forced to leave... While drunk 18 year olds that shouldn't have even been in there were stumbling and falling around us, yet they were allowed to say.  Not only were we made to leave, but my boyfriend suffered a bleeding lip, has scrapes on the side of his face and he recently had knee surgery and in being physically removed, he injured it again!! I have a bruised arm and lost my Fitbit while there because the bouncer grabbed my wrist so hard that it ripped off and is now missing.  On top of all that, we were not putting up a fight but the bouncer felt the need to \"call for back up\".  This place was ridiculous and I will NEVER go back and I suggest if you're reading this, that you don't go!!!! It's sad when they can over serve 18 year olds and a couple of 30 something year olds get physically removed!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Carson was one of the best bartender I've had in Charlotte, definitely coming back to see her. Can't wait until I'm back in town so I can come again and again."}
{"text":"Don't know how to answer their phone even when they are open !! Boooooo"}
{"text":"Weird, \"Asheville\" crowd with karaoke and good beers you get crowd but a safe culture experience with a good staff. If your staying at the Aloft or on the Epi check this spot out.  The bowling game and PBRs make for a Hell of a Hangover but great memories.  Like most of Asheville very diverse crowd"}
{"text":"Packed with people, Its in the center of the Epi center complex.  Very easy to find the parking.  They offered the parking garage next to the Epi center.  We didnt order any food just went there for a drink.   It was a fun place to hang out see all the actions."}
{"text":"Not impressed one bit.  With so much competition nearby you need to separate yourself and this place did not.  The food is your typical bar food. Nothing that stands out. A place like this needs service and it was lacking. Our appetizer was delivered after our meals and only because we asked about it. How hard is it to bring out tortilla chips and guacamole? The answer we got. \"Sorry.\"  Fortunately I asked that they not charge us and they obliged. Look elsewhere unless your desperate.  Maybe I'm negative since the Bears lost but there is better things around."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Came here for new years and lunch a few times and it was great. Very friendly bartenders. Scott is the man!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is at the Epi center. Came on a Saturday night and it was a good crowd. The music played depends on the band and the night. It could be hip hop or rock or who knows. Its a relaxed casual place that can get crowded as the night goes on. It's a good place for the night time scene. They remove the chairs and table at night to accommodate a larger crowd and allow dancing. I would skip it for dinner, but they do have a late night open kitchen. The staff that work there are friendly. Drinks came strong the night I went. They have video games and dart boards in the back. The bar has dollar bills posted everywhere and you can leave one too with your name. They have the sharpies at the bar for you. Not sure what it means, but it's a cool memory idea. Went to use the bathroom....and no soap plus it was a hot mess. Told the manager and he got right on it. Overall good place to get a drink and good down to earth bar type feel. Not sure if the food and I left after the band played two songs.... so hope this helps."}
{"text":"We recently went to the Tin Roof while we were out and about in Uptown Charlotte. If you are looking for some good music and drinks this is the place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for a quick lunch and didn't want to go to Whisky River.  Tin Roof is a cute little spot; the food is decent, their drinks are pretty good as well.  Eclectic atmosphere borderlining on cheesy (lol) but it's still a nice place."}
{"text":"Don't who the band was that performed tonight but they were kick-ass. Their spin on pop songs, \"Hold On We're Going Home\" and \"Rock With You\" to name a few, were amazing. Also, if you want to get food you won't be disappointed with the Shrimp Po' Boy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a better rating!  My family and I were in search of a good place to watch some afternoon football in Charlotte before the Steelers-Panthers game yesterday. After walking past the TIn Roof and noticing the fun and laid back atmosphere, we decided to grab some food and drinks there. The servers were very attentive. The food was good, especially the queso. The prices were great.  I would definitely stop by again next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is unsafe. I've witnessed several fights here in the last few months. Yesterday 4-5 guys randomly decided to fight my friend and while punches were being thrown I got hit in the face...by a man. When we complained to the staff, they \"spoke with\" the aggressors, did not kick them out, and then tried to persuade me to re-enter because \"everything is fine now.\" We paid money to hang out in a place that welcomes people who hit women!! I will never come here and neither should you."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in, and the place had maybe 6 customers. All waitresses were on their phones, very unprofessional and it took them a while to actually look up from their phones to see that we were there. We Came for food and drinks; drinks were okay, but the food was terrible. Very limited menu, we both ordered quesadillas they were terrible. The chicken tasted and smelled like canned chicken, had no seasoning or flavor to the quesadilla whatsoever, the cheese wasn't even gooey like it should be. The chips and salsa are a joke. They give you hardly any chips, and they were stale chips that came right out of a chip bag. Not authentic at all, and the salsa tasted like water. Good thing this place has live music, because that is probably the only thing keep this place afloat."}
{"text":"This place is inside an epicenter and is one of its many cool places to get food and hear some music. I got the pepper beef tacos ($4 each!) and they were very good. There's a full bar and live music. There are big garage style doors that slide open when the weather is good with some outside seating."}
{"text":"Tinroof is a great casual bar to hang out, listen to great music, watch live bands and they have an endless supply of drinks! Any drink you want they got it with reasonable prices. If you're looking for a good time, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty decent depending on what time you go. It is always hot in the restaurant though! Music scene is pretty good. Wings are larger than expected. My fiancé tried the pizzadilla and it was good but different at the same time."}
{"text":"Went to Tin Roof today for lunch with 3 other friends for the first time.  Loved it!  We had a great server, Claudia, who gave us an overview of the place, what they offered in the evenings and suggestions for lunch.  The food was good, the place was open and airy and they played great music!  Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Had a fun time here on a Friday night listening to live music and getting my drink on!   The food was okay but giving this place 4 stars bc of the service,ambience, and live music. We had two servers, one was in training. They were both very attentive, constantly asking us if we needed more drinks or food and refilled our waters frequently.   We ordered the chicken and waffle nuggets as a snack. The chicken wasn't as crispy as I wanted it and prob would ask to put the syrup on the side. But overall fun place!"}
{"text":"What's the point of registering for Friends Trivia if we are going to be packed in like sardines? Because of the amount of people in the establishment it was excessively loud and service was lacking.   Trivia good. Good drink specials."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Tin roof has some of the best service the epicenter has to offer. If you come here be sure to ask for either Justin or Tom! They are the best and will provide you with the best personal experience there is to offer !"}
{"text":"Visited a few bars in Charlotte on a Saturday night and ended up here. 5$ cover charge but friendly guy on door allowed me in for nothing as it was late on and I just wanted a nightcap. Good band, great atmosphere and friendly staff and punters. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Came here before a concert and waited 20 minutes before someone even acknowledged us.  We placed our drink order and it took them 15 minutes just to bring our drinks. We ordered our food and it took them an hour and a half to bring our chicken sandwiches. Ridiculous!!!!!!  Never going back."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place, but the $5 cover is ridiculous. People were turning away from the door because of the cover... it was an empty bar. So much potential though. I hope they get rid of the cover so I can enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"I had to leave the tin roof after 30 minutes this afternoon. There's a strong smell of turpentine in the air that gave me a terrible headache. If you're sensitive to these type of chemicals I would recommend avoiding the place today"}
{"text":"So last week I turned 21 and decided to celebrate during the weekend when all of my friends were able to. Anyway, I went here last night and didn't even make it through the door the bouncer was so ignorant and incompetent. I am from PA so naturally I have a PA ID, and yes I am very aware that it is protocol to be more careful with out of state ID's which is more than fine with me since I carry a real one! Now I don't know if anyone has seen a PA ID before but the holographic is very obvious and in depth (definitely a hard ID to copy and make a fake) and on top of that...THERE IS A RED LINE RIGHT IN THE CENTER SAYING \"Under 21 until....\" So I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for the moron to realize where the date was...one entire minute later he looks up at me, looks down, makes a confused face and with attitude says \"ok\". Excuse me??? So now as if you didn't embarrass me enough in front of everyone around, you didn't even give me an explanation or apology as to why it took you so long to check the damn ID. So I walk in......and walk right back out!!! Why give my service to a place where disrespectful people are hired. No thanks :-) So thank you, Tin Roof, for really making me feel at home and welcomed!"}
{"text":"The food was eh. The service was eh. We ordered the nachos trio appetizer. It apparently does not include plates or silverware, like a spoon. The queso was pretty good. The salsa wasn't anything special. The guac was ok.  Served with plenty of chips, no plates or utensils though. There are forks already on the table but it's kind of hard to scoop up salsa with a fork. We had asked for plates and were about halfway done with the appetizer by the time we got them. I did not bother asking for any spoons.   I ordered a turkey club.  It reminded me of the ones I make at home, kind of small not a lot of substance. I think maybe there was bacon on there though. Mostly toast. Actually I think mine is better.  The fries were crispy and looked like they had a pink tone to them. It was the lighting though. At least I hope it was.    Our server really didn't seem very interested in serving but she was friendly. Three stars for a fun, light atmosphere and good french fries."}
{"text":"I provide a different perspective with my Yelp reviews sometimes- that of  a single person frequenting nighttime establishments by himself- which probably isn't of much interest to most people.  But this is Yelp gosh darnit and like everyone I must believe my opinion is of uptmost importance of being documented online for all to read! (thank you South Park- the TV show not the neighborhood)    I've only gone there for drinks and entertainment so can't comment on food (although I sorta do at the end).    Biggest positive is the staff other than bartenders (obviously meaning they will show up under cons) are very good.  Good in that know how to maintain control of the place and let people cut loose a bit without things getting super crazy.  Keep up the good work guys.  The bands they bring are solid no doubt but like with most live music in Charlotte Friday/Saturday tend to resort playing a lot of the same type of songs.  A lot of the bands don't do enough to differentiate themselves from the band that played the night before or last weekend.  With that said it's still good music which was has drawn me in here in the past.  I'll probably not go as much in the future though.  Not because of the drinks price which are typical Epicenter a bit pricier than most places.  But the bar staff really leaves a lot to be desired.  Not very pleasant for what I think a bartender should be where they should make you feel welcome.  A lot more of an attitude \"This is my job to serve you drinks.  Please tell me what you want so I can on to serve the next person.\"  Coming back to the single guy perspective, I'll say this which I noticed more so at Tin Roof but also tend to get the same vibe at some of the other Epicenter bars.  In general they don't treat the person out alone very well.  There's a bit of a suspicious \"What are you doing here you weirdo\" type vibe there I picked up off of every other bartender.  Most recent case was winding down a night of drinking there.  I'm someone who when I do drink I'll readily admit I like to pound a lot of beers but very rarely do I ever get out of control.  Yet my drink consumption was limited by someone who talked down to me a bit like my Mother telling me that I should slow down and finish my beer like being told I need to eat my vegetables before eating dessert.  Now I'm all for bartenders being diligent in trying not to overserve customers and quite frankly in the name of cash too often they're too lenient.  But as a single person I fall under greater scrutiny which is often funny given how my behavior is generally more reserved than most of the people there in groups.  So yeah call me a whiny little b- if you will but yeah it's not cool to be treated differently like this when you're there to have a good time and spend money.    I advise people to check it out if you're into hearing live music and get a sense as to whether it's your kind of place.  Like me though maybe you'll find after a while it's not all it's cracked up to be perhaps for a different reason than the one I have.  And for the love of all things delicious- you don't go to the Epicenter to eat food!  If you're going out on the town there's tons of great non-Epicenter restaurants which are a better value.  Hit that first and then come here for your night of drunken debauchery."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service was terrible. Tonic water was flat and no one cared. Apps came out with stale chips. It's a tourist trap, I knew that, but wow. Really bad."}
{"text":"All the straws at bar were nasty with stuff on them. Plus hair was on bar. .... Just not clean at all. But bartender John was cool, and very good."}
{"text":"Was never a particularly good bar in any aspect. Boring food, overpriced drinks and a completely mediocre aesthetic devoid of any identity.  But the Trivia on Wednesdays was great, and brought a much needed pulse to the place. That was the primary reason I ever went.  Now with new management in place, they've dropped the trivia host and replaced them with a cheap imitation, AND stole a creative concept the previous trivia host had been pitching for ages.  A piece of shit bar, now run by a piece of shit manager. I'm not going somewhere that disrespects the partners that helped drive traffic to their location.  Screw this place, just go to Whiskey River."}
{"text":"Drink specials were pretty great especially for what we gathered for Charlotte bars. There was a live band and the crowd was a hilarious mix of drunk upper twenties and weirdly some upper fifties. Was not what our group was looking for, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Top notch place. A must see stop in Charlotte! Live band was Jerry Jacobs setting the perfect atmosphere"}
{"text":"10/13/17- Was invited by the new manager, Christina. I didn't see the Mac and cheese on the menu this time (maybe I over looked it) so I opted to get the Hawaiian BBQ quesadilla with some tots. My guest ordered the Dixie biscuits as an appetizer and the VooDoo grinder as a meal.  I must say it was much improved. My quesadilla was delicious. The pork was well seasoned and tender and the portioning was large so I ended up taking some home. I did taste some of the voodoo grinder and it was good, though my guest complained it was a tad cold. The Dixie biscuits were much improved. The were cooked well, the biscuit was flaky. I still didn't get the taste of peach jam though.   I would go again and see if the Mac and cheese back or if I missed it. But what I had this go round was definitely improved from my last visit.  Christina said they will be expanding on one side and adding a club to one part and having the live music in the main dining area. Seems fitting for the EpiCentre"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick drink and our bartender was great.  We had a starburst and a couple lemon drops and they are most excellent!"}
{"text":"Thank you \"Tom\". I'm out here in North Carolina Charlotte stopping by for a few days and decided to go out and get a drink. I went to Tin Roof the best service I have ever had thanks to Tom. Tom definitely treated me as a \"regular\" even tho it's my first time. Awesome guy thanks Toms."}
{"text":"The brisket tacos are amazing as all hell and get more than 2. Trust me you will want to continue ordering more and more. The live music is on point and pretty amazing itself. All in all great atmosphere and great food with a great staff."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and enjoy a great beer and food at a good price. I was pleasantly surprised to grab a big beer for $3 and a burger for under $10! Not typical in Charlotte. They also have karaoke on Wednesdays, which is very fun and brings a great crowd.  The wait staff was very pleasant and fun and the atmosphere was fun as it was full of old time-y decorations and songs. If you want to have  fun and cheap night out, check out the Tin Roof!"}
{"text":"My god! Is all i have to say about this honeycomb hideout in the epic center,i didn't even get a chance to take pictures because we were so hungry after leaving the day party at Kandy bar so we needed some simple food items to hold us over. Those smothered tator tots omg were like heaven melting in your mouth, how can something so simple be so good?? We smashed those things and ordered two more orders im not even lieing when i tell you guys this. We also had quesadillas which were just as good simple food that taste like so much more.This is a bar type environment with live music."}
