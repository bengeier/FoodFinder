{"text":"Have been several times, and every time the food and service have been fantastic. Especially love the queso, but the tacos, burrittos and the burritto bowl have all be r eally good."}
{"text":"A small menu done well. In addition to tacos and burritos, they offer a nice quasi-burrito bowl with quinoa (it's served cold). Good prices for what you get. They also offer a selection of Mexican-style beers and a variety of hot sauces to go. A welcome addition to Beverly!"}
{"text":"We tried all of their tacos, plus the queso. We liked the carnitas ones the best, and we'll definitely go back for more. The \"carne asada\" ones were not proper carne asada, but ground beef -how disappointing! They should call them what they really are. The jalapeno salsa that came with them was yummy, though. The chicken ones were bland. Like some other reviewer pointed out, nothing was warm enough. We didn't like the queso, as it tasted too much like flour. All in all, this is a very convenient location for those of us who live close by, and the prices are very reasonable. They just need to make some little improvements."}
{"text":"My husband and I had high hopes for this place; unfortunately, we were really disappointed. The carne asada is false advertising; instead of chunks of seasoned beef, it was bland ground beef. The chicken taco was also bland. The guacamole was atrocious; it had a very strong taste of lime and very little avocado taste and just didn't taste like guacamole at all. We actually asked for another one, but it wasn't much better (and the chef thought it tasted fine). Afterward, we discovered that we'd each come to the same conclusion: This is the worst Mexican we've had in a long time. Sorry Io!"}
{"text":"Have only been once.  I got the carne asada tacos and they were somewhat bland.  They come default with corn tortillas, which I don't particularly like.  Next time I'm going flour, and maybe adding salsa and guac to fill out some flavor.  I may also try a different meat.  I'm not sold yet, but I'm wiling to give it another go, especially at the cost of 4 tacos for $10.  The tacos are decent sized.  Also, I'm intrigued by the margarita shots."}
{"text":"Even though the reviews for Taco Diablo seemed to be kind of hit-or-miss so far, I wanted to try it out for myself, and I am glad I did.  Stopped in today for lunch, and decided to try the tacos.  There are three kinds of tacos on the regular menu, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Red Chile Chicken, and today's special of the day, was Steak.  Prices are $3 each or 4 tacos for $10, so I decided to try one of each.   Four tacos were almost too many to eat for one serving, but somehow I managed.  The Steak and Chicken tacos did have a lot of liquid drain out of them, when I picked them up to eat, but other than that, I liked them and thought they were warm, and flavorful.  The carnitas was my favorite, it had a lot of flavor, and really didn't have anything dripping out of it like the other two.  My least favorite was the Carne Asada.  To me it looked and tasted more like ground beef than Carne Asada, and it was more of an Americanized taco with cheddar cheese and lettuce (The others were more like traditional street tacos).  Overall however, I was pleased with my lunch, and wouldn't hesitate to stop back again.  P.S.  As was mentioned in one of the other reviews, this is not a sit-down restaurant, it is very small inside, and there are no chairs, only one table, and a few shelves along the wall, if you decide to stand and eat-in, like I did.  They do have drinks available including Mexican Sodas, and also a few different cans of beer available too.   There are also lots of choices of bottled Hot Sauce available if you so choose.    Lastly, the only problem I had here was with the parking meters outside.  They cost 25 cents for 15 minutes, and the meter ate one of my quarters, and didn't give me credit, so it actually cost me 75 cents for 30 minutes, which was just enough time for me to order and eat."}
{"text":"Wow, how disappointing.  From the IO family and not up to their other restaurants standards.  We had 4 Tacos.  All were hardly warm, how about warming the meat, and lacking taste.  The health department may have a field day if the temperature of the meat in the warmers was checked.  The Red Chile Chicken taco meat was hardly warm overly moist and mushy. The Carnitas was OK but the Jalape√±os made it not the meat.  The Carne Asada was just so meh and had to much cheddar.  Do yourself a favor go the Las Palmas or B's which are not to far away.."}
{"text":"So we finally found time to stop in and grab some lunch.  Everything was great.  The tacos come double shelled and are decent sized. My wife got a bowl and it was also nicely sized - probably a little larger than a Chipotle bowl and about $1 more I think.  My wife loved her bowl and I enjoyed my tacos but I did think they were a little bland but I say that as I am used to the hot salsa at Chipotle.  Unlike Chipotle,  you get a very nicely sized bowl of salsa with the chips.  We will definitely be back for another lunch but we'd like to see them open on Monday's.  They have a small stand up table and some small wall mounted \"counters\" for those who want to eat on site.  Mexican sodas, water and a few types of canned beer are available."}
