{"text":"Best donuts in town!!! Amazing drinks and service! Definitely the place to be if you want the best quality donuts"}
{"text":"I don't even like donuts! But wanted to bring my kids for a treat. The cake donuts with sprinkles were so good!"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing! Definitely highly recommended. Very reasonable pricing and super friendly staff! Tamara is the best! She makes mine and my little brother's drinks spot on every time! The food and bakery goods are delicious! This place is definitely one of my top faves in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great selection, friendly staff, roomy cafe, and great addition to the shopping center"}
{"text":"Boba here is horrible! Also horrible service! I can't believe SUPRISE doesn't have any good boba here! Star donut is way better than this. Really don't recommend this place and once I got a crosant whit ham and cheese and IT WAS WAY PVER SALTED AND THE CHESSE WASENT EVEN MELTED! Really really recommend Star Donut better"}
{"text":"Chocolate chip frappe was pretty bad.  Donuts were average. I thought this place had just recently opened but all of the furniture and equipment looked like it had been there for years."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers, I came here with high hopes of really amazing boba drinks. So I come in and notice the board of drinks and ordered a frappe with boba nothing crazy. However after taking a few sips I noticed the boba is real bad it was hard and didnt seem cooked right like fake imitation boba. It was so bad I couldn't finish my drink I just tossed it and the stuff in the drink was really watery and bad tasting. I thought maybe off day no biggie but it was a real thrill kill, I don't know if I will ever be back. If you like boba drinks then go to an actual boba shop this place is like a knock off of boba didn't seem like something they would be good at making. I don't recommend this place if you're looking for boba drinks stick to the regular places like yo and I or bomboba."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in on Easter and give this place a try.  We were not disappointed.  Glad to have a local place in Surprise.   We had donuts and a bagel and both were great. You could tell both were fresh.   Great variety with donuts.  I was surprise they had a full menu with breakfast burritos, sandwiches and bowls. Also had lunch sandwiches and salads.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"(I stopped at the Litchfield location, not this one- SORRY!!!)   Stopped in for a quick fix. Got my son the mini blueberry muffin & a pack of the day-old donuts.  Delish!  There were 4 in the pack, so the ones that carried over to the next day (which would make them 2 days old) were still perfect!!!!  Soft, fluffy, and everything you expect from a wonderfully made donut!  Yuuuummmmm!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight. They seem to have many types of donuts and coffee. There was only one type of cupcake, red velvet, but alas it is Valentine's day. The cupcake was really good. Pretty light and fluffy and the frosting was tasty without being overly heavy and sweet.I hour they stick around!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Besides having the most delicious doughnuts I've ever tasted, they also have delicious breakfast sandwiches that are a great price. I love walking there with my baby in the mornings and letting her have a mini muffin while I get my breakfast. The staff is always super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Everything looks good here. My friend got the Taro Boba, which was okay, but kind of watery and less flavor than others I've had. I ordered the Matcha Boba which looks amazing from the other pictures on here. Yet they were out completely. But they didn't tell us that until 5 minutes after we already ordered and paid. At that point, my heart was set on Matcha and nothing else was going to suffice.   If you run out of something, communicate with the other employees that it is 86'ed... That should be known as soon as you run out so that you don't let people continue to order it  3 stars are based off of the overall experience and my friend's watery Boba"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! So far I love everything here. Please keep up the good work. I just wish I ate more doughnuts. They are so good! Hopefully they are still here in 5 years when I get another doughnut craving. The breakfast sandwiches are really good too so I will be back soon. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Just moved to area and was determined to locate a store with good Donuts. Found it! Great donuts, great staff, great customer service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I used to frequent the Goodyear location but it's nice having one so close. Great service, drinks, food, and donuts. What more could you want"}
{"text":"Really good... Need to stock up on custard Donuts...they have run out twice this week. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a donut person but my grandma is and she loves the donuts here. I loved the customer service been here a few times and they are always personable."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and pastries! Plus they offer military discount which is always a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to check it out and pick up a few goodies for the kids. It's a nice little bakery with some very tasty looking treats at a reasonable price! I bought an oatmeal raisin cookie, snickerdoodle cookie, blueberry scone and a turtle brownie bar which the kids all really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This is a great stop for coffee and pastries.  The donuts are delicious and all the people who work there are so nice and helpful!!!  We will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a local donut shop! The donuts were melt in your mouth fresh and the selection was huge! They also have tables to sit and enjoy coffee and breakfast sandwiches. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!! Customer service is excellent, smiling sweet and caring! Donuts were soft, fresh, and tasty. Breakfast burrito was fresh and fabulous!!!!!! The menu is overwhelming in a good way because I want everything! I can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Local joint that I will continue to support often. Breakfast - delicious burritos, donuts, cinnamon rolls, and lattes. Lunch - turkey club sandwich is fantastic and their prices are so much better than their competition."}
{"text":"Just opened I believe. Nice to have a donut/bakery in the area.  I will visit tomorrow and update on the donuts, etc I judge a donut place by the Maple bars and Apple fritters. Hopefully good"}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally got here!  I stopped in once to check it out when they first opened, and they had more selection, like sandwiches and lunch options which is no longer the case. Every time I have been at the theater or stopped in it has been like a ghost town.  It was disappointing because they are super friendly and have some good product, but I fear location (not the easiest plaza to pop in & out of especially to just grab pastries) might do them in.  Also the signage is down and it is located off the street with no signage near the road. Just not the kind of thing you grab before or after a movie... So after chatting up the lovely lady at the counter I discovered that the reason they paired down the menu was lack of business:/ I decided on an apple fritter (REALLY GOOD) it was very moist, with a sweet crispy exterior and chunks of apples (not just hints of apple sauce) with a perfect cinnamon balancemmmmm... I'll be saving my blueberry jelly (lemon/raspberry also available) donut for later;) Please try this place out...it's worth saving...we need good options in our community"}
{"text":"Just made our first visit to Sugar & Spice after reading reviews on yelp. Take away from experience was \"it's ok\", but not destination. I had a breakfast bowl with eggs, cheese, potato, and bacon with cup of coffee. My partner had a breakfast sandwich and coffee. Both were fine but could easily have made either at home. Folks did come in to buy donuts. Maybe that's the draw. Apple Fritters are popular. We might come back if we are in neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went in this morning for donuts & drinks. My 7yr old got a chocolate donut with sprinkles and thought it was amazing. My husband got a plain glazed donut and thought it tasted like a donut. I got a maple donut and thought it was very good. The maple was very lite though, almost tasted like a plain glazed but it was very soft & fluffy. It took a very long time to get two blueberry smoothies which is why I took a star away. Ladies that were there were very nice and the price point was very good."}
{"text":"This is a cute bakery, with minimal seating inside.  The staff is friendly, and the coffee is good.  The egg dishes are good, neither coffee nor breakfast dishes are extraordinary.  The donuts are yummy, my biggest complaint is that this shop has the donuts delivered from another location, and so they never have certain traditional flavors my kids like.  Their overall pastry selection is small for a bakery, however this location is still pretty new.  Their hours on the website say 6am each morning, but the hours on the door start at 10am Monday through Thursday.  Not very convenient morning hours, although they may have been in the process of changing them.  I would have given 3 and 1/2 stars, but since I had to choose I gave the benefit of the doubt and rounded up."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Not that impressed. Donuts were super fresh. Airy and soft. Not a big selection. Best donut we got was the buttermilk bar. Tried the jelly donut. Filling was good but not enough jelly."}
{"text":"Read the AZ Republic article and decided to check them out since my daughter is a doughnut aficionado. Of all of the mom and pop doughnut shops I've tasted in Phoenix, this place has the best taste and texture. Not heavy by any means. Great doughnuts!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! So glad they opened this place, Surprise needed a donut shop like this, Dunkin donuts is horrible and this place has been great."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was welcoming. The menu items offered variety and tasted delicious. The service was friendly and quick. I was able to settle in to get some work done while also enjoying this family friendly environment."}
{"text":"Best ever! We were walking out of the Imax theater and a lady with a pink basket stopped us, invited us to sample a doughnut hole. The outside of the doughnut hole is crispy and the inside soft and yummy. Super super super nice gal. We walked in and ended up with a dozen doughnuts and holes! The after lunch sale on the doughnuts is too hard to pass by. I sampled an old fashioned dipped in Chocolate, best ever. The shop is clean, available tables to sit down and not a lot of music / noise in the area. I highly recommend you pop in. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"While visiting from out of town we decided to stop here to get our day started with some food - and we were not disappointed! My partner and I both decided to get donuts; I got the pink sprinkle one, he got a glazed twist and we decided to split a blueberry, old fashioned donut. We also each got a coffee. I ordered the Irish Creme Iced Coffee, and it was absolutely delicious. Personally, I had never tried this type of iced coffee before so I was very impressed. The bakery itself was also very clean, cute and well organized. I hope that it continues to get business, and I hope when we go back to Arizona we will have a chance to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this cute local joint close to my house..delicious hot breakfast! They have quite a few items on the menu to choose from. Great customer service and the donuts are fresh tasting! I will be back! They could use more seating tho in my opinion.."}
{"text":"Sugar and spice is the perfect little cafe... Staff is super friendly... I recommend the chocolate croissants (simply delicious)"}
{"text":"We all enjoyed our donuts and drinks! I got a Boba drink and it was great, as well as the chocolate croissant! My boys loved the sprinkled donuts. They didn't finish them, so they were tasty snacks for later in the day.  My only complaint was paying $1/donut, that's pretty steep for just one. The price for a dozen is fine, but buy individual and the price is a bit much."}
{"text":"I loved their donuts and cronuts.  They have a maple bacon donut that has bacon inside the donut!!  It was so delicious I could have had 6 more.  I want to go back to try their other food.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"This place was not in the least bit like what I thought it would be from tons of friends descriptions. I was imagining a quaint Victorian Tea shop instead of a warehousey looking, small, very bare coffee shop with a small display case of donuts. With that said the ladies behind the counter were top notch thus the four stars. I was on the fence to rate it three or four. Four for local and great service.   I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and a cinnamon crunch doughnut hole. The pastry was very tasty but not the best in town and for some reason I disliked the sandwich. I do not know why this is so it might have just been me. I do not hold it against them. I am very picky about my chicken salad and for some reason I did not like the way it tasted. It seemed to have a bad after taste that stayed with me and tasted more like tuna, which I do not like. Like I said I do not hold it against the place. I have preconceived notions and am spoiled on excellent Chicken Salad and it ruins it for other places. I always search but never find an equivalent. Ha! Also, I did not see any other goodies besides doughnuts. I would have liked to buy some cookies or scones to take to my Bunco party. Maybe they were sold out or Sundays are limited?   Since I do not live in the neighborhood it would not be worth it for me to go back when I live closer to the Glendale tea shops. However,  I would definitely go back if I was in the area to try other pastry and to support local business. The ladies were so funny and kind that I most certainly would go again just to visit them. If you live near by I would say check it out. I have friends in the neighborhood who swear by their pastries and just plain regular coffee."}
