{"text":"Posted some photos from the experience my wife and I had yesterday at Paramount - Heartland location, you be the judge. We were there at 5pm, it wasn't busy at all. The food served to us wasn't fresh, I am so disappointed and I felt cheated when I saw the condition of the food which was served to us. I am not a difficult customer and I don't create a scene either but since yesterday I can't forget the worst experience I have had and the upset stomach. There were pieces of chicken skin fat in my shawarma platter and the salad was stale, the fattoush salad we order didn't have the crispy chunks of fried pita it comes with. Small portions with lots of stale fries , is this what you call fine foods?! The service was extremely slow, we had to look for someone to give us more pita bread. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, we clearly mentioned our table number to the server and she ended up serving the bread at another table. I spent most of time time scavenge through our order and left with plates full of old food which seemed microwaved. $45 for two platters and fattoush salad."}
{"text":"The lamb dinner is the way to go. Ask to be seated upstairs as it is less hectic. The pizza is delicious as well. Seating is a bit tight. Price is a bit high for the style of food."}
{"text":"We've shared the mixed combo platter between 4 people and we did not leave the place hungry ;)  Darn those attentive servers who periodically come with steamy pillowy bread...  The falafel was a little bit denser than what I'm used to but still good.  Still dreaming of the fries with garlic sauce and fattoush salad!"}
{"text":"First time trying Paramount Fine Foods - heard both positive and negative things about their other locations and had to try this for myself.   This is their newest location. They had been open a few weeks when I visited with a large group of friends. The good news is they were able to accommodate the large party on short notice. The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery.   The nightmare came when it came time to order. You had to navigate yourself through the crowds of people to the other side of the restaurant to place your order. They had so many staff around I don't understand why they don't have table service. The nightmare continued when the food took over 45 minutes for everyone to receive their food. Some orders came within 15 minutes, others took up to 45 minutes. By the time the last people received their food the first group of people already finish their dinners.   I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold. The beef was very tough - couldn't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands. The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted. I also tried the butter chicken pizza which was ok. Mixed reviews from the other people we were dining with as well - the grilled chicken was good as was the other barbecued items. some of the other pizzas that they had tried we're also just okay. One of the only highlights was the pita bread that was brought to our table when we arrived - it was piping hot.   Maybe it's just growing pains. I will give another location a second chance."}
{"text":"Had Iftar (breaking the daily fast during Ramadan) here on Saturday. Great food and excellent service. New menu and decor. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Worst, really disappointed, the food is too expensive for that place while all Italian restaurants around it are pretty much the same price and much nicer. Service was so bad. They offered us hummus with bread and I thought like other restaurants that bring something before the meal it would be free and they didn't say there was any charge and they charged us 8+tax and tip. Don't recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern casual family restaurants in the GTA. The food quality is amazing, service is fast, and quality is overall consistent for any years now. Try the shawarma plate to be shared between two, mixed grill platter.fresh bread is seven with every order."}
{"text":"-Very good service (regardless If you tip or not). -Waitresses and sometimes the owner keeps circling around checking if anything is missing and if there is anything you need on a very friendly manner. -Food is great almost like every other paramount restaurant  Went there with my lady and we tried the Lentil Soup and we were very satisfied.  I highly recommend the Arabic sweets they offer .. you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad but not my best experience. I've been a regular at the original Mississauga location on Dixie and I've always loved what they had to offer but this location is must closer to home.   I absolutely love the interior design of this location but the seating is very congested. Being seated at the head of the table, I kept getting nudged by anyone walking by. Something I'm not completely fond of with the chain itself is paying for your food before you get it, which includes a tip. The tip part is what kills me lol.   Being part of a party of 7, everyone ordered shawarma plates while I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap. Surprisingly mine took the longest and didn't come until majority were half way through their dinners.   I DO however LOOOOVEEEE their complementary fresh and hot pitas and hummus....yum!  The food itself was good, not the best shawarma I've had but it was good. In terms of customer service, it's always a hit or miss with this location. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad but it's never been consistent. I'd say go and give it a go"}
{"text":"heard good things about paramount so i checked it out. skewers are tasty shawarmas are average.  i give food 3 service 4."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly staff, nice decor and clean area.  Grills and fatayer are ok.  Great location. Opens late.  Compared with the surrounding fast food restaurants, this might be the healthiest and tastiest alternative. If you want arabic fast food, then look no further.  The McDonalds of arabic food in toronto -though a bit healthier-.  Cons: Can be a bit crowded at times.  Salads are not good. Sweets are super market quality.  The food is average at best. This place would not survive in an arabic country.   Sadly it is one of those places that can get away with below average food given the populace's unfamiliarity with actual good arabic food.  Overpriced for the quality.  Alternative: Arz fine foods offers surprisingly well made -and cheap- arabic salads, appetizers and cookies. Location sucks, though =/ ."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations so I'm confused as to why 1) I was given no bread. At every other location you are automatically brought bread, 2) I had to pay an extra $.50 for hot sauce. Come on, that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my wife (she is 9 months pregnant)and daughter took us 10 mins to get noticed then 10 mins to get seated even though I could see open tables. We then waitied 15 mins and nobody came to our table, moments later another couple was seated and about 30 seconds later someone approached then to take there order. I then got up and left as I was leaving the manager asked what's wrong I told him and he said okay like there was no problem. I should have to sacrifice service and respect for shwarma. I rather go to shwarma empire where they care about client. Or johnnys shwarma these places do not have nice decor and fancy lighting but they respect their clients and know how run a business. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"I wish I can give them 0 stars. I had beef shawarma in this place and unfortunately it was below average - dry and tasteless. I had to pour the tahini sauce on top to tolerate the meal.   The customer service is even worse. The pepper bottle had a loose cap so the entire content of the bottle was poured in my husband's dinner. The waitress communicated the issue to her manager, but the manager could not care less. He did not even bother to come and apologize. My husband couldn't eat half of his plate but we still had to pay the full price.  You can always improve your products; but you can never win customers with such a bad management. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am big fan of Arabic food so I was thrilled when Paramount opened close to our house. We went there 3 times- I was disappointed all 3 times. I went back just to see if the bad experience I had was a one-off - but it seems like it's gone downhill. The food is OK - nothing to rave about but slightly above average. The service is non-existent. But that might be the fault of the whole setup. So lets take it from the top. There is a wait- which is fine- but it's not OK to let 'friends' jump the line. When you finally get a table, you have to really watch how you walk to your table- they are so close together you are scared of upsetting someone's food or stepping on a jacket hung off the ridiculously tiny chairs. When you get to your table and check out the menu, you can relax- you have to go stand in line at the counter to place the order and pay. Of course you are asked for a tip right up front. Hey I don't mind tipping- but I would rather see what kind of service I get before I tip. Just saying. If you forget to order something - especially if you have kids with you or are in a group- you have to repeat the process all over again. By the time you do all this and eat your meal - you might- just might forget that you ordered dessert too - and what's worse - the server's don't bring it unless you remind them and show them the receipt. We forgot once and walked out of there having paid for dessert and never got to eat it. So - I gave it 3 tries- but no more- Paramount you are off the list."}
{"text":"majority of the waiters there stunk like BO.  Didn't enjoy our food.  You look at the menu while you sit and have to go up and order it like at a fast food restaurant.  They were looking for a tip?  Tip for what?"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY. As you enter, you're deafened with a very loud Arabic prays(Alla who akbar) Ordered a falafel and waited 25 minutes. Checked when it is going to be ready, the reply was \"we are very busy, I don't know\" Since I already have paid for it, went to the cashier and asked back my money."}
{"text":"If you feel like having a good kebbah do not hesitate and go to this place. They are really good!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. The male looking waitress was unnecessary rude when we asked to move to a cleaner table. It was our first time coming to paramount so we didn't know how the place worked in other words we didn't know we had to order at the cash then sit and wait. The waitress didn't mention this and snapped at us when we asked if we can order now. The food was nothing special, pretty bland if you ask me. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to be treated like trash and pay twice as much for food you could have got at a villa medina"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant one week ago, they opened this location few months ago and it was a good added to the neighbourhood. The  food was good, large portions, good price and loved the bread. They need to work more about the service, they still look inexperienced."}
{"text":"I love Paramount. It's the best Middle Eastern food I've had in Toronto and it's a great option near the Eaton Centre. The fact that I always hear more Arabic than English being spoken at the tables around me lends even more credibility.   The pitas come fresh from their wood burning oven as do the zatars. The chicken shawarma is amazing, the hummus fresh, the soup is great too.  Every time I go I try something new and so far I've been very happy. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the labneh but I was never a big labneh fan to begin with.   The decor is cool, it seems to be in an old stone house with a pointed roof which you would never guess from the outside.   The only drawback, and it's a big one if you're in a hurry, it Paramount's popularity. It's always packed and you can expect at least a 30min wait for a table if you go right at lunchtime. The poor servers, while they do their best, are running around like crazy trying to keep up with the demand.   I've been many times, and will continue to go anytime I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The Manakesh are great. Soft and flavoursome. The labneh platter is tasty with the freshly made bread. Always my first choice of breakfast when i come to Toronto.   Also came for dinner and tried the shawarma sandwiches and they were very good.   Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit slow on this bandwagon, went there for the first time about three weeks ago. We were both newbies and it was completely confusing trying to figure out how to order etc...but once we passed that hurdle it was all good! They have a small patio but we were inside - you order, get  a number and grab a table (or something like that...). The pita bread and hummus were incredible! I could have just filled up on that! We had shish tawouk and the kafta plate - both were absolutely delish and I completely understood why there were so many people there! They serve huge portions and we ended up taking quite a bit home. Also, their baklava is amazing!! You should make sure to save space for dessert! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for mediterrenian flavors. Authentic food, delectable and fresh. Those who are looking for spicier food should look out for indo-pak food. splendid desserts selection. Must try unique fresh baked from kiln is cheese bread or zaater bread."}
{"text":"$11 for a salad with barely any chicken. For take out they didn't even give me a fork. This place won't last never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Decent place for Middle Eastern food in Mississauga. Food was good and the place is usually full"}
{"text":"The best thing I have to say about Paramount is probably the fresh bread (pita) that they serve you as soon as you are seated! The food are your typical arab food i.e. shawarma, shish tawouke (those are what I normally get). They are pretty good if you are a meat lover but I'm not so I didnt enjoy so much.. their salads are okay as well. The seatings are a little crowded as the place is always busy. Do not expect any sort of amazing service since they serve your food and leave and they may occasionally re-serve you the bread (but ask for them if you want more!!)"}
{"text":"Very few vegan choices. Service is slow. Falafel sandwich was way too salty! I had to ask for water - waiter did not pay attention to our table."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the taste and presentation. Just a little room for improvement in  the customer service at the table.  just give a little water refill...  :-)"}
{"text":"I visited this restraunt for a team lunch and was very disappointed.  For $23 I had a lamb skewer and serloin beef skewer and a side taboule salad.  Nothing wrong with the food but the prices are terrible.  Steer clear!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but service is terrible. 40 minutes for an order to be 'ready,' they lost track of their order stub, subsequently lost my receipt to help track it, and had problems calculating what a full refund was."}
{"text":"The manakeesh (zaatar, beef and cheese) was comparable to the downtown location (decent), but I would have never expected the terrible service at this Paramount.   My main, shish tawouk, came 30+ minutes later than everyone else at my table with no recognition. When brought to the attention of the manager, I still didn't receive my meal for another 30, and yet it was made incorrectly. Though it's a self-serve type restaurant, our party still had to wait 45 minutes for a pitcher of tap water? On a Monday night without a full house? Unacceptable.  Definitely would not go again to this location."}
{"text":"First time here, won't come back. Food looked good but the service was brutally slow. My meal basically didn't come, and I sort of refuse to wait an hour for a falafel ... seem to prioritize take out orders over people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"For most new places I always like to go back a few times before making up my mind. At first the layout and design of this location was nice and the staff was friendly. I have now eaten in once and taken out a few times. And my view of this place is that it's not going to last for long. The quality of food dose not compare to other locations. I order the same thing at every Paramount and only here is there so much oil you feel sick after eating it. I think they need to rethink their business plan and re train staff on food preparation."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was great - not sure why all the other reviews are so negative! We went here on a nice summer night and sat on the patio. The service was excellent from the waiter, and the manager even came out to check on us at one point. The food was hot and fresh when it came out - we ordered a few apps and one main course. I live in the neighbourhood so I'll be making this one of my go-to restaurants when I eat out."}
{"text":"When I saw the price I almost walked out. Due to lack of time on my lunch break, I decided to give this place a try. It was worth every penny. Delicious and WOW... you get pitas, hummus which are both great unlimited AND your main course"}
{"text":"I was at the Mississauga Location a few weeks ago and the food and service was AMAZING !!! I came all the way from Oshawa, Ontario and it was my first time having Middle Eastern Food and I ended up having the Chicken Shawarma and it was DELICIOUS !!!  The atmosphere is GREAT and the staff are all Friendly and were Very Helpful to a Newbie, like myself !!! Extra Thanks go out to Katie who came by our table and told us some of the history and Cool Stuff that goes on at Paramount Fine Foods !!!  All in All...A GREAT evening with GREAT Food !!!! 5 Stars out of 5 !!!! I WILL BE BACK !!! THANK YOU PARAMOUNT FINE FOODS for a WONDERFUL Experience !!!!  Sheldon Cohen"}
{"text":"Kafka was delicious. White rice was bland. Service was slow. Wish we would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"My gf and myself just had lunch here and paid $25.00 for a chicken shawarma and a chicken shawarma plate. The pita bread was brought without any condiments or dipping sauce. The shawarma was small, bland and without much flavour at all. The basmati rice tasted sour. When asked how we liked the food we told the truth and said it was bland and we were given a barrage of excuses including its a franchise we can't do anything. I mentioned the pita bread without any dipping sauce whatsoever, which was again given excuses that its our standard! I believe it's waaay overpriced and bland. Go to another middle eastern restaurant like Ali babas, for flavorful middle eastern food and shawarmas."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING. If the rating was based solely on food I'd have given it 5 stars but unfortunately I find that the servers there aren't very attentive to your needs, hence the docked star. Sometimes, you ask for something and they never bring it to you, you have to ask several times. But other than that, they are not particularly rude or anything and like I said the food is absolutely GREAT in more than generous quantities!! Personally LOVE the shish tawouk plate!"}
{"text":"My favorite Middle East restaurant. Food is amazing and service is top notch. We usually go during off peak times as the restaurants does fill up in a hurry during a sy times and kids like to have the small indoor playground to themselves which allows Mrs and I to enjoy our meals before we feed the kids.  Make sure you leave room for baklava!"}
{"text":"The worst paramount location I've ever had food from. Took out a whole chicken off their menu and they sent it with half cooked bread and stale fries. When I called and spoke the manager, the unapologetic person asked me to come back so he can bake me the bread. I do not know if it's his humor but I wouldn't recommend this location to any one."}
{"text":"Everything except their wraps is pretty good. Their meat is so damn dry."}
{"text":"I like middle eastern food and I really hoped this place would be good but .....food is cafeteria quality. Room, although new and decently furnished is loud beyond belief, blaring music, noisy kids and worse!   But the ordering method is bizarre. Wait to be seated, then choose from a menu, then go to a cashier and order, then pay, return and wait for food. I am not a fan of prepaying for gas, much less for restaurant service.  Awful, one star is lowest rating possible but it doesn't deserve that."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations of paramount Fine Foods and have generally enjoyed the experience. This location, however, is very busy and that seems to affect the food and the service. I could be forgiving about the service. Our server was actually quite friendly and accommodating, just too busy to be effective. His colleagues, also extremely busy, weren't able to even attend to small requests, such as a small bowl. The food, however, was mediocre at best. We shared a mixed platter. The beef shawarma was overcooked and cold. The chicken was quite boring, without much flavour. Overall, disappointing. I want to like Paramount, which seems to serve better quality food than most chains and has an owner who appears to care about the community. But I will stay clear of this particular location."}
{"text":"Food is great but having to go order my food and pay prior to being served takes it down a notch."}
{"text":"Great for groups: - Come for the Hummus, Baba ganuj and freshly made  pita bread(bread is free) - share a mixed grill plate with kebobs, shish touk etc - a couple of order of Makanesh (pizza- zatar and beef with cheese are the best) - finish off with a few bites of Bakhlava I'd say their shawarma is a little on the dry side but decent.   Great for hostess gift: Bakhlava! so many types! For $12 you can get a box of 20.  I do wish they'd let people sit upstairs! I'm still yet to be allowed to check it out."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group.  The chicken shwarna and beef shwarma wraps are on the small side and not tasty.  No one seemed to like theirs.  The 1/12 combo platter we ordered was tastier.  The service was disorganized.  Food was dumped in the middle of the table rather than served to the person who ordered it.  This led to people accidentally eating the wrong items.    I'm not planning to go back.  For those who are planning to go here, we did like the Baba Ganoush, the puffed bread that appeared when we were seated and that they easily do separate bills."}
{"text":"Too bad this place doesn't have more competition; the food is pretty mediocre and often not fresh, service is chaotic. This is not representative of middle eastern food but sadly most people don't seem to know the difference."}
{"text":"Really cool place! As everyone mentioned, the pita bread here is like the Hulk of Toronto's mediterranean world: Gigantic, and smashing. They come piping hot with steam rushing out of it and they are really perfect to nibble on while waiting for your food. The service was a bit slow, but I wasn't in a really rush so it wasn't a big deal. However, I wouldn't come here if I wanted a really quick on-the-go lunch, but then again they have take out for that :P   Their prices are very reasonable, the shwarma plate was only ($10.99!). They also have other cool things on the menu I want to try next time, like the pizza ($5.99 I think?) and the sandwiches.   Another cool thing about Paramount is that it blasts cultural music which makes me feel like I'm at some family dinner party. The portions are gigantic, so big that you will probably have to share with a friend. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had visited recently with a friend and had a Fattoush salad with the chicken shawarma  as  a takeaway. The salad, crunchy bits, chicken, garlic sauce and flat bread were excellent. I loved it.  I came back today ordered the same for takeaway only to find a dry green salad with a tiny bit of dressing on the side, no crunchy bits, chicken on the side and no flat bread.  It was very disappointing. Of course, this is what you find with a takeaway when you get home and see just you you have. Needless to say I will not visit Paramount again after this visit. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews but I had to for this place. Having heard good things about the food, my mom and I decided to drop in for lunch on a weekday afternoon. The place was relatively empty and quiet, which was nice, however I cannot get over HOW TERRIBLE the service was here. For one, make sure you pick a table and remember it's number, you then have to go to the cash and order what you want. No one was there to tell us this, no signs, nothing. At the cash, the lady is quite rude in telling us how we should have chose a table before order - okay fine, we didn't, don't have to be rude.   The food was mediocre, I've had better Chicken Shawarma and Falafel in plenty of places, there's no way of choosing your toppings or making it spicier. The chicken was very dry. The Veggie Pizza is atrocious, I think I make better pizza at home. No thanks.   I decided I'd like to try a few dessert items, waited at the dessert bar for probably 15 minutes before I had to call the staff over to ask if they could help me - mind you, there were 2 other waiters there who caught my eye but did not bother to come over and see if I needed help. After that, I went to pay at the cash - the staff at the cash kept walking away, not asking if I want to pay or why I was there. Finally i had enough, told the guy I'd like to pay for the rest of my meal and was outta there as soon as I could be.   If you're looking for poor service, mediocre food and a bad taste in your mouth, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! ! The service is quick and friendly, we love this location...we ordered mixed grill and it was out of this world...the manager passes by checking and we have asked him for more garlic sauce and hot sauce, he brought them right away...the kids area was full but great hang out for little ones.."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was awesome!! Family platter was good for about 6ppl. We ordered some extra side dishes as well."}
{"text":"Will not return again...Place has been open for a while now while the food is \"ok\" I do not understand how the service(even though friendly) can be so chaotic. I went during lunch and ordered take out assuming that it would be quicker. I was wrong. Given the restaurants surrounded by office buildings lunch is probably their busiest time. And their service absolutely crumbled to the pressure. Total wait time for my pita wrap to go was over 25mins. With a line forming at the takeout/pick up counter the servers stationed there would just keep looking at your receipt to see what you have but would not do anything to expedite the order. They stood patiently until the food was delivered to them to be packed up for you while reconfirming you that it would just take \"2 more minutes\". Given that in the area there are many many other places that serve the same type of food I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was my first time here and like the other reviewer ordered a sharwarma wrap. It was also dry and tiny!  On top of that it took them 15 mins to make it. When I asked what was up with my order they told me it was sitting on the counter for 5 mins. If your ordering to go save yourself sometime and go to the other place across the street!"}
{"text":"Recently my friend told us to try Paramount and little did we know, they were opening one closer to home. They just opened their Erin Mills location on November 15th.  We decided to try it out last night. Boy, was it busy! Driving by, you can already see the crowd waiting inside (thankfully there's a decently sized indoor waiting area). I thought they were joking when I was told it would be about 10 minutes...and I still think they were (just to keep us around). We ended up waiting 15 minutes, so it wasn't a bad estimate.  We were told to check out the menu, then order and pay at the counter. We returned back to our table and were given fresh pitas that were warm and puffy, which we enjoyed until it cooled down. It took 15 minutes for our food to arrive at our table, which was not bad considering how busy it was.  We wanted to try a bit of everything, so we ordered a plate of Chicken & Beef Shawarma and a plate of Mixed Grill. It was an incredible amount of food for two people, but it can definitely feed up to four. Each plate came with a lot of plain white rice (the other option was fries), some pickles, a little bit of lettuce and tomatoes, and delicious garlic sauce (don't forget to bring a pack of gum!). Out of all the meats, my favourite was the shish tawouk. The marinated chicken was very juicy and it was cooked perfectly. (The shish tawouk plate is something I will definitely order next time!) The BBQ beef was nice and juicy, slightly but not overly chewy. I'm not a big fan of kafta, but the kafta was not bad. Considering it is a Middle Eastern / Arabic restaurant, I was expecting the shawarma to be one of the top reasons I would dine here again. However, I was pretty disappointed with the shawarma meats because they were both dry. The temperature and the texture of the meats tasted like either the plate itself or the meats had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time.   The staff were all very friendly and quick at everything they do as they were trying to clear the tables as soon as possible. I thought the restaurant was a bit noisy, somewhat similar to a bar and grill with a lot of chatter plus the clinking of cutlery and plates.  All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is even just slightly interested in Middle Eastern / Arabic cuisine. It's a nice, friendly environment, the portions are big, and the shish tawouk is great!  One more thing... Our friend also told us \"one cannot leave without having their baklawa\". I have never been a fan (maybe because I've never had well-made baklawas), but we still decided to try their entire assortment. The first one I tried was the cashew-filled baklawa and it just melted in my mouth... It was a tiny bit too sweet, but so delicious. Our friend was right. I'm not sure I will ever step out of there and not have a bite of their baklawa before I leave!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars! Extremely bad service - went to get a beef shawarma so instead of giving the fresh and hot beef, they gave the beef from the tin cans they had previously cut and kept - when asked to be served the fresh beef they made a ridiculously big deal of it and involved other staff members who were equally rude and unaccommodating. The shawarma by the way tasted awful and just the two bites I had before leaving the rest made me feel queasy most of the afternoon"}
{"text":"I understand that Toronto isn't exactly the ideal place for finding good tasting shawarma, but I was optimistic when I first heard about paramount and how it was the next best thing! I had the opportunity to try their food for the first time at the Toronto Pearson airport, and I thought the service was slow there. Which I assumed was due to it being a busy airport. So, now I went in with high expectations into this downtown location of paramount fine foods. My friend and I decided we would dine in. We were led to our table in the well-lit decor of an open concept restaurant. We placed our order. The order was perhaps one of the simplest ones yet. Two chicken shawarma sandwiches and a hummus appetizer. I inquired whether the hummus came with anything, the waitress replied \"ah yes you can use the complimentary pita that we will give you\" and I said 'fantastic'. But silly naive me, I assumed the pita would come along side the hummus because let's be honest for a second. Hummus is a staple Arab food and it is most likely made before hand. You may think \"pshh what are you talking about. It was probably fresh\". Yes you're right, that would make sense IF it weren't for the pact that it was already nicely proportioned in a plastic container. The pita got cold and I had to ask a server about my hummus before it finally came over to my table. This is unacceptable. If you are giving an appetizer and complimentary pita (which is hot), ensure that they are paired. I could get cold hummus and cold pita anywhere! Ridiculous.   The saga continues. The table next to us was seated after us and their more complicated order was delivered before ours. I had to ask my server again to find out what was happening. I felt embarrassed having brought a friend who never had a shawarma in her life before. At this point it was 45 mins after we were seated. That's right 45 minutes. \"Maybe the restaurant was busy\". No it wasn't; perhaps 60% full.  The sandwiches come, finally! (maybe the meat was hand delivered from a mountain near the Mediterranean sea). They were wrapped in paper bags and honest to God, it looked like I just went to McDonald's and I was handed a to-go order. How was the sandwich? The exterior felt cold but the meat was still warm. So this tells me that the pita is not warmed or pressed before or after addition of the meat which would help seal the sandwich. It's common practice at most reputable shawarma joints. The flavours were quite neutral with nothing quite standing out. Usually it's the garlic taste or the chicken seasoning that leaves a memory within your mind. In this case, there was none.   I had a bad experience so I am biased. This restaurant is over priced and too egotistical for its own good. The food is decent but does not at all qualify for \"fine food\" label. Finally, if I have to wait 45 minutes for a frigging chicken shawarma, I better be on a Gordon Ramsay show or you are trying too hard to be something you are not.   Get your act together."}
{"text":"What a waste of prime real estate. This is a failed attempt to make paramount a fast food place. It's only been open a week and already the food looks sad and the employees sadder. With pamier kebob not too far away and although their location isn't as fancy their food makes up for it.  Couldn't recommend this place nor will I go back.  This place could easily be the reason for upset stomach in the near future. Totally agree with other reviews talking about food from tins with brine. Nothing fine about this paramount location."}
{"text":"First of all, the chicken was delicious. The salad was good. Their garlic sauce is amazing. I would give them 5 stars. Now the problem I had was I paid $15 for the salad and chicken tawook. The salad was so little and I got 4 pieces of chicken. Either they screwed up something or they are giving out tiny portions. It was like eating half a meal."}
{"text":"5-star for their wood fired oven pita bread is awesome! Looks like a mini fluffy pillow! Sooo cool! Mixed grill was ok. The beef sirloin was way overcooked and def. not juicy."}
{"text":"Negative : Meat was dry and overcooked. Place is small and lot's of cold come in all over. During prayer time in the mosque music is turned off instantly. No any type of alcohol served.   Positive : very close to subway and Bloor /Bay shops. Affordable prices for the location, compared to the expensive restaurants near by. Flexibility in menu ordering."}
{"text":"I went with another friend, even though I asked for bigger table, I got for two, a very tiny dining table, hardly to have you plate and that's it. Waiters were very confused about my order, they had to return it two times in order to get what I ordered.   Service is on the lower level, they don't really serve you all you need, like another glass of water, or if  you dropped you knife and ask for replacement, never happen to get new one. If you want to try middle eastern foods, I would go to Ali Baba. Finally, since its halal food, no beers at this place, so I would avoid it next time."}
{"text":"Do not go here for take out - you will wait a long time, whether they are busy or not. I had to wait 20 minutes for a take out order of a shwarma plate. I set a timer on my phone so I am not exaggerating how long I waited. They were not that busy so there is no valid excuse for why it took so long. I went there because I wanted meat, and I wanted it quickly - I figured it would be faster than getting a burger to go at a pub.   The staff of a well run restaurant would have informed me that there would be a long wait for chicken, and that if I was in a hurry I could switch my order to beef only (instead of chicken and beef). When one of the staff handed me my order  he blamed the person who took my order for not being proactive, instead of owning the mistake and trying to make up for it.   The food was OK but not particularly good. The portion was on the small side, but not pitifully small like some of the other commenters have described."}
{"text":"Whats  stopping me from giving this place a 3.5-4 out of 5 is what i witnessed the last time I ate there.  Been there quite a few times, usually get same thing, shawarma plate, pitas and their moutabbal.  Nice garlic and hot sauce, pitas are amazing.  Solid food. But last time i was there i was waiting for pickup and i watched a lady behind the food counter reforming raw meat on a skewer before putting it on the grill, moments later without taking off the gloves or washing her hands she started putting raw pickles and vegetables on peoples plates in the prep area.  Completely unaware that she had just handled raw meat.  That grossed me out so much I can't return :("}
{"text":"For those who want to eat shredded cardboard, order the beef and chicken shawarma. You won't be disappointed.   For those who want other authentic middle eastern food with good customer service, get your fix elsewhere. Save your money!  I had to go somewhere else to get another dinner as this was not edible. You'd figure the least they could do is get the naan right.  Both times we were super disappointed. The other posts praising this place is misleading."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when this location opened because I love the food at Paramount however...  I find that they lack consistency in how the food is served and it is very expensive. I ordered a skewer of lamb and a skewer of shish tawouk; each approximately $8.00. I received 4 small pieces of meat on each skewer. They often get my order wrong and the service is mediocre. Restaurant is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This Paramount location is fantastic! The service is fast, friendly, and welcoming and the food is absolutely delicious and flavorful.   My favorite is the mini mixed grill - a platter that brings all the tasty together in one delightful presentation. The zaatar manakeesh with thyme and sesame flavors is a must have too!   I love the relaxed atmosphere here with comfy seats and awesome food.  Would highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"food is good, but the restaurant is so very poorly designed that the times I was there just turns one off . The management and service isn't great as a result. People bumping into each other, as you are standing or sitting at your table. If you do takeout - it is not just order, pay and takeout. You pay and then you have to stand by the front and then in the middle or the rest is where they put your order. People are milling around all over while waiting to order. Then the area where one pays is just everyone where everyone crowds leaving a total bottleneck. Just no thought to best usage of space and customer service"}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrible!  I ordered a Shawarma wrap for take out- on previous visits I was told go with that option if you're in a rush.  Well 15 minutes later still no sign of it.  Keep in mind the meat is already cooked and literally takes a few minutes to put together. I cancelled and walked out.  The place did not seem overly busy. Lots of empty tables and no explanation given by kamal (apparently a manager).  You should treat your customers better - you've lost this one. I'd avoid this place."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food along with delayed and non responsive services. I convinced my friends to go with me to paramount for enjoying best quality food. Unfortunately from now on ward I will not recommend anybody to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Appetizer: I've tried the wine leaves, the hummus, the tabule salad and the babaganush and although I've had better babaganush, they are not bad.  Food: Love the shish tawouk as its very healthy and ideal for when I'm trying to watch my diet.   I've tried the pizza and it's amazing. I also love the blown pitta bread that they give free of charge.   I've tried the ground been and didn't like it very much as I compare it to the iranian Kebob which I find a lot better.   I've also tried the shawarma sandwich and give it a four star!    Dessert: The little sweats they have at the front are ok but not the best, but again, they have lots of sweets made with dates and are a healthy option   Service: the service is good considering that they have a different way of brining the food to the table. So first you picks table number, go to the counter, order your food and then sit down and someone will bring your food. So it's really a combination of fast food and dine in. The people are very friendly and nice and have a smiles on the face which is always nice.  Price for value: fair. The portions and pretty big and the atmosphere is nice and welcoming thought it does get super loud with the children and families especially during peak hours on weekends."}
{"text":"The service is crap ( although they try hard), the food is shoddy, and the wait is always long."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place GETS it. Great food, great service, great staff --- I use this as a regular to dine out with friends, family, and clients. Everything is great -- but here's a \"walkthru\" if you've never been here. Get the zaatar cheese bread, hummus, tabouleh, hot fresh bread (this is free), mix grilled platter or the shawarma platter. The portions are nice. Top off with a fresh juice smootie or cocktail or  a \"halal\" beer. If you have room, finish off with the free Arabic coffee. I've been to the downtown Toronto and Yonge/Steeles location and both are very good!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of paramount! Not so much of their shawarma, but of their manakeesh (pizza) and grilled dishes.   For the first time I tried the mixed grill. I shared it with my father. It was amazing! Everything on the platter was good. And as always, the manakeesh and strawberry juice was divine! Excellent.   I like this new location a tad bit better than the Crestlawn one. It's bigger and aesthetically for pleasing. For kids it even has an indoor playground---McDonald's style! What more could you ask for?   Overall, a must try if you like middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. The kafta sandwich was inedible, too salty. The chicken sandwich was so horrible you couldn't take more than one bite. The tabouleh wasn't fresh at all!!!!! It was was obviously days old! We returned it and the gave us a \"fresher\" one which was slightly better but still the taste was not good, too sour and the burghol in it was hard! It was like eating a salad with tiny rocks. The pizza was ok, still not even good. Whatever you do, DONT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"The mississauga location seems to have better food. Semi ok food. .. will do for the price.  Beef was dry and hummus not the greatest."}
{"text":"Well-known Middle Eastern resto delivers .   'Middle Eastern' (ah, what a gloriously ambiguous term) recently replaced sushi in my heart as a healthy and exciting go-to cuisine. Either because the novelty hasn't worn off yet or more likely because it covers more literal and figurative ground - hey geography! - I love me some baba ghanouj, pickled veggies, meat skewers, tabouleh and in-house pitas. Paramount was on the 'must' list as a staple of Toronto's Middle Eastern cuisine offerings. I went in blind, not knowing regional dishes or price range, and I left a happy customer.  Atmosphere:  Unexpectedly low-key. The lower floor is more cafeteria style, with small tables along one wall for two to four people, possibly more if you pull some together. It was busy when we went in but we got a table for five right away. Upstairs it looked fancier but also busier - we were possibly in the family-friendly section and the hip younger crowd was above us, but who knows? Clean, but not fancy, the lower floor is definitely casual and friend-material, though I would not take a blind date there if I wanted to impress with vague lighting and minimal yet upscale décor (ahem Spring Rolls etc). Brightly lit and bustling, it was just what the doctor ordered prior to a free Flaming Lips concert.  Food:  The pita bread was probably the freshest I've ever had, puffed like beach balls and steamy hot on the inside. Delightfully naked pita! Tasting fresh and warm right from the oven, yum!  Appetizer: Moutabbal. So good! I admit to loving eggplant, so it is not hard to please me with this dish.   Main: Mixed Grill Plate with one skewer of striploin, one skewer of Shish Tawouk and two skewers of kafta. Big enough to split, and we did, this was well worth the $16.99 pricetag. The striploin meat was tastefully charred and tender, the chicken tasty but nothing too special (easily remedied by loads of garlic paste and hummus that came on the side -although strangely no one wanted to be my special friend after the meal) and the kafta was deliciously spiced. Not the very very best I've had, but very good nonetheless.  Pickles were not number one either, but still very good, and the itty bit of salad was fine. Obviously, one does not order a mixed grill dish for the lettuce. In the spirit of modernity and fusion, our order could have come with a ginormous side of slightly limp fries, but we decided to pass. Enough bad carbs with the pita, bring on the rice and hold the heart attack for later.   Service:  We were greeted at the entrance with a smile and our servers were very friendly. Our orders unfortunately did not come at the same time, and we ended up getting both fries and rice due to a kitchen error, but our servers did their best to pick up the slack and came to refresh our water several times.  Location:  You can't get more central than this! An easy, stiletto walk from one of the Dundas exits, or a leisurely stroll through the Eaton Centre, Paramount is easy to find and easy to get to.   Overall:  I would go back for tried, tested, tasty and true 'Middle Eastern' cuisine, either for a quick dine-in or quality takeout. Hit up Paramount for a casual lunch or din with friends. You can have your kafta with a side of hummus and fries - aka have your cake and eat it too!   Update: Paramount is Lebanese and also a bakery, which is why the pitas were so fresh. And yes, upstairs is where the sweet lounge is, so next time, we're going to get all fancy fresh on the second floor with our falafels!"}
{"text":"First time sitting in. The food is awesome. Is a little cramped in terms of seating, but the pita is worth it. Got the mixed grill platter which was a good mix of their best dishes. Very filling. Couldn't eat it all. It's uncomfortably warm though and I couldn't get out fast enough. Their take out is solid if you want a mildly over priced shawarma."}
{"text":"We ordered some bbq chicken and a beef pepperoni pizza, it was weird that we had to pay first, so one is forced to tip ahead of getting a good service - which leads me the part where I explain that there was barely any greeting from the server and no indication that I had remember my table number before making the order on the other side of the restaurant.  The food itself was \"meh\", there are bazillion places around the city that serve a better bbq chicken, the pizza is basically marinara and a few pieces of pepperoni on a pita. They forgot to get my basket of bread, I had to ask for it and they added some complimentary hummus and hot sauce (which is the only reason this review gets two stars)  No one bothered to check on us if we were having a good meal nor did anyone bother to fill our water. Oh, and the music was loud ! I only hope your experience will be better than mine. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love their fresh pita and hummus.   I recommend dropping by to grab one to go. Pita comes with the hummus order. Their mango juice is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing friendly service. Will definitely come back repeatedly. Say hi to the General Manager Ali!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow and painful Sevice. Not like other paramount restaurants across GTA. The food took a long time to come and fries seemed to be from yesterday. This place seems to be more focused on takeaway than the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great family environment! Ate here for a table of 14 and everyone enjoyed the food. Food came at a very reasonable time with excellent and responsive service. The beef and chicken shawarma combo plate was the go-to!"}
{"text":"I get paramount for takeout every couple months but when I got mine today, it was half the portions. I'm quite surprised by this and I will not be going back to paramount anymore. I'm really annoyed by this."}
{"text":"Been here twice , each time screwed up order. Slow service. Confused staff. Tiny sandwiches"}
{"text":"I love the food and the service is always fast and courteous. Even though they are always packed. Price is surprisingly inexpensive for the food taste and quality. I'm very impressed on the service, everyone are so nice and helpful.   My favorite from the menu: - Chicken Shawarma - Falafel - Even the complimentary bread are so good! - And the Paramount Special, it's a type of drink/dessert, it's so delicious.  And a tip for you who love hot sauce, ask for the red hot chilly sauce, yum!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I have never written a review before this one, I have used yelp many times to decide where to eat, but I have never been moved to write a review of my own. My awful experience at this location has prompted me to signup for a Yelp account just so I can share it.  I have been to many Paramount locations, and I really like their food and service, generally speaking. My experience at other locations has always been good.  That's why when they first opened this location I was so excited because it was close to my house. The first time we went there I was not impressed by the food or the service, but I figured they had just opened and they still needed to iron out the problems. I decided to give it another shot and went there yesterday with my family. The service was mediocre and the food was awful. To make it short, we were given cold bread to start, the waitresses kept coming to our table with other people's orders,  and the food was horrible and cold. I personally ordered the Mujadara and a skewer of Shish Tawouk and started feeling sick since the moment I left. It has now been OVER 24 HOURS and IM STILL SO SICK. I have not eaten anything since my meal there yesterday. It's unfortunate because this location has a lot of potential but they need better staff and better food. I will gladly drive further to a eat at a different location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Place itself is nice but I didn't come there to sit, I come there to eat. This was my first and perhaps last time to visit this place. We order three different items from the menu with some additional items on side. I believe that issue with this place is organization. They have bunch of young non-trained kids. They are polite and running around but they have no clue what they are doing. At least 9 different kids come to our table to ask how we are doing while I was waiting for my food. First they served us side items. Next 15 min later they served dish for my wife and kid and my food arrived 15 min later when they were almost done with dinner. To be very honest instead of enjoying dinner with my family after dinner I was upset. Food quality is disappointing. I had better experience in walk-in shawarma place in Pickering.  If you are looking for halal food just grab something from \"Silver Spoon\" and go to Loblaws on the second floor where employees have their lunch and guarantee you will enjoy it better than food from Paramount."}
{"text":"Had their chicken skewer dinner plate. Chicken breast chunks were juicy. There were two skewers but in total the serving is considered small. It came with fries and salad but the fries were cold and dry, and the salad was terrible! Dry, wilted, disappointing. Their free pita bread was really good though and they were not stingy on that! I even ordered a roasted eggplant dip just for the bread. That was quite good too. I would come back to try some of their other skewers and shwarma but I would pass on the salad and fries and just stick to the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I know this place just recently opened but my experience is almost exactly the same as that of the first reviewer. I generally like Paramount and was initially glad to see a location open in Etobicoke. The warm fuzzies quickly disappeared though after I had to wait 30 minutes for 3 shish tawouk sandwiches ($7 each) that were to go. There were lots of staff on hand but few were doing anything, and most seemed to be either wandering around or checking on what someone else was doing. At least three staff came over to see what we were waiting for. There was no sense of urgency and someone from the management team was more interested in telling his kitchen staff how handsome and we'll dressed they were than actually looking after our order. When we finally got our sandwiches they were downright puny. They looked more like a tiny fajita with about four cubes of chicken, some wilted lettuce and garlic sauce. At no point were we ever asked what we'd like added to our sandwiches as they do at most Middle Eastern sandwich places. They were so wimpy I could have eaten all three and still had room for more. So yeah, the name paramount is definitely a misnomer. Nadir would actually be more appropriate."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service at this location. The Mississauga location and the Yonge-Dundas location have always been excellent so I thought I would take my family here expecting the same level of service. Half of our order didn't end up coming after we waited for 1.5 hours. When I went to the cash to let them know I no longer wanted the FOUR items we were waiting on, I said excuse me to one of the staff to get her attention. She ignored me. I said excuse me again and without looking at me she said \"just one moment\" but never came back, even though I was standing in the middle of the restaurant, and instead went to speak to another staff member. What food did arrive came out very far apart and one person would be done their meal before the other had even received theirs.  When I finally got to the front of the line at the cash to let them know and have these items taken off the bill, the same woman who had ignored me was called by the cashier for help to void the items (I think she was the manager and the cashier didn't have the authority to remove items). Again, she did not look at me while she adjusted the bill. She did not apologize or address the issue at all despite the fact that she is probably the manager. Very poor service: rude, exceptionally slow and incomplete order.  We won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation seen in a magazine listing the 350 best restaurants in Toronto, I went expecting an authentic Middle Eastern meal, which, for the most part, I got. Prices were reasonable on the appetizers and a bit overpriced on the main courses.  For appetizers we had okay hummus ($5.49) which could have used more garlic, four good falafels ($0.99 each) and a reasonable Zaatar manakeesh (a bargain for $2.49). The surprise was a couple of fresh puffed up (like New mexico style sopapillas) pitas. I should have chosen the cheese and Zaatar manakeesh which looked very appetizing when it arrived at the adjacent table.   Our main courses, a dry and somewhat tasteless beef shwarma plate ($11.99) and a slightly better lamb skewer plate ($16.99), were disappointing. Fortunately the tahini that came with the shwarma was very good and a thicker style than seen at other places. More hummus came with the lamb that had much more rice, also dry, than meat.   The place was very busy on a Friday evening. The highlight was good service by our waitress, Yana (I think). As I stated at the beginning, it was authentic, which doesn't necessarily mean good. As for the magazine article, I would not list this as one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Especially since they charge an arm and a leg. I rather eat at a shawarma place with holes in the wall then this place. My experience there is the worst. The staff treat you like garbage. My husband and I didn't feel like we belonged. I will not be returning for that simple fact. I live across the street anyone that asks me I tell them the same thing. Go find another middle eastern spot it'll probably be way cheaper and friendly with better food!"}
{"text":"I told the employee 3 times I want tahini and garlic, he put a shit load of hot sauce on my plate. I told him that was not what I want, he just walked away! Portion was tiny as well! What is wrong with this place!!!"}
{"text":"Had chicken and beef, which was tasty. Good service. Didn't have to wait too long to get a table."}
{"text":"Good food, hot, and on time. This is all what we need good job Paramount. Servers were very efficient and fast."}
{"text":"Standards are generally pretty low in an airport, and prices high. I thought this food was surprisingly fresh, real, and delicious. And service for me was very quick. They've only been open a month - perhaps other reviewers experienced their growing pains?   I had a chicken shawarma wrap and a zaatar pizza. The pizza was the highlight - hot, crisp, and chewy all at the same time, almost like a wood fired oven does. The wrap was tasty and made of fresh ingredients, flavor wise was pretty good. All in all, for airport food a nice surprise."}
{"text":"This place was in the middle of nowhere even for suburban standards. The outdoor patio concept is not bad but I wish I didn't have to see auto repair shops and other industrial complexes while sitting out. The ordering system was very confusing. You order at 1 counter and then pay at the other end of the room. The place was chaotic and the food though above average wasn't the best."}
{"text":"The most common complaint on here is about the ordering system at this restaurant. You pay at the counter then they bring your food to your seat. Why is this so hard to grasp? Nandos has the same ordering system and it has over 1000 restaurants in over 30 countries. ( it obviously works)  I prefer  ordering this way, no waiting for the bill when your ready to leave you.   I had the chicken wrap. Tasted really good, had a light garlic sauce and salad in it. The kids had the pizza. They were ok but rather bland. Neither finished them and the oldest normally always does.  They have a very small kids play area which is good and kept them entertained. ( it's really for kids under 7 I would say)  Good value, nicely decorated, clean. Yes I would go back but wouldn't go out of my way to make the trip."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends. A bit of line up but the service and food are both passable, We had their mini grill platters., which is a better deal than just chicken or beef.   The hot pits bread is good...an outstanding plus  The dark Persian tea is a nice touch.   The chicken is good but the beef was a bit dry.   Service was average to better than average, consider the crowd. We did not order dessert because paying  $26/kg for baklava is a bit steep. I ended up going to Amadeus instead   I would like to suggest some improvements   1. The washroom can be cleaner.  I know it is a Friday night and it is busy.  I had to use the toilet paper to dry my hands because they ran out of paper towels, they should install hands free taps, soap dispense and automatic hand dryer,   2. Toilet cleaning schedule during rush hours. Washroom had toilet paper left on the floor.   3. Try to seat the customers after the table setting is on the table. We sat at the table without napkins, dish or water.  We had to ask the servers for them.   4. Set price for dessert sampler to avoid the guessing on the price.   Ps I prefer the paramount in Mississauga - better food and cleaner washrooms :)"}
{"text":"Loved it. Pita and hummus was great! Meals were all good and they came quickly, even though the place was packed. Staff were all friendly and looked after us well. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Beautiful franchise, with subpar food and bad restaurant practices. Your visit might be good or bad, it is a toss up, as result, I do not recommend this location.  Paramount Fine Foods has been expanding and adding new locations recently, but it has come at the cost of quality and consistency.  Seems that collecting franchising fees is more important to original owners than producing quality food. However, ownership has done an excellent job creating a beautiful interior and ambience that is consistent among the locations.  Food at this location was unimpressive, I ordered a mixed plate grill to go. Some chicken was raw inside, beef was not bad had charcoal flavour and two pieces of kofta tasted like they marinated by different people. One skewer of kofta was ridiculously salty while the other tasted like it had too much of a spice. Half the fries were overcooked and hard and the others were cooked little bit.  While waiting at takeout area for my food, a waiter came back with a plate of fries and said the fries were cold.   Manager yelled at the chef. Chef then proceeded to scoop salad, chicken shawarma back cold table and steam table. Fries went back under the heat lamp and some burnt fries left in the fryer went there too. This all happened in front of manager and the manager so I understood this as being appropriate behaviour in the manager's eyes.  It is unacceptable to reuse returned food to reserve. The food could have been contaminated by a customer, surprising thing the kitchen is open and the had no shame doing it in front of takeout customers.  Beautiful franchise, mediocre food and bad management do not recommend."}
{"text":"This is not the Paramount I fell in love once. I paid over $9 for a Shawarma Sandwich and a can of 7up. The shawarma was the tiniest one that couldnt feed my wife who doesnt eat much.  The order and delivery system was a bit chaotic  Tthe most eye opening event however was watching the guy behind grill walking into the freezer, coming up with a frozen grilled whole chicken and putting it in the microwave. The menu says whole grilled chicken is around $20.  Oh Boy, I dont think I am ever going back to Paramount."}
{"text":"I was stepping into heaven and I didn't know that. This is one place you wish you knew even before you were born. If you love bread, if you love chicken, if you love rice (they have lots more, this is just what I had) then the doors of heaven are waiting for you. Amazing service + Amazing food = stop thinking about it and come by. I have run out of stars for this review."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 chicken shawarma wraps & a falafel wrap to go. Was told it would only be less than 10mins, but waited for 25mins. Was able to sit down and finally eat a chicken shawarma but when I    Open the bag, the wrap was so small! How disappointing! I was expecting a good size for a 7\" wrap, but it was measly! Even worse, the chicken was dry and lacking! So sad that they call themselves \"fine foods\" when they can't even get a shawarma right. I wouldn't recommend this place for a shawarma - go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"A Toronto institution. Authentic tasting Lebanese food at friendly prices. Slightly let down by inconsistent execution. Ranges from fantastic to okay. They're always busy, so can get orders wrong, but they're also always friendly and flexible, willing to fix whatever you need."}
{"text":"Went for take-out lunch and it was great. Fast too! And they gave me fresh bread, even though I was taking it out.  I've had the chicken shawarma and the kafta kabobs and both are great. Next time I'll get extra garlic sauce since they gave me so much bread!"}
{"text":"Food sucks  Don't let the fancy smancy restaurant fool you  PS be ready to get your wallet raped"}
{"text":"Terrible value. Tiny portions and bland food make this place not worth the price. I miss the old middle eastern place at this location."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery! Came with undressed Fattoush salad and for $8 it's small. I ended up getting Uber Eats to refund which is nice. Rip off salad for the price  Also ordered for delivery chicken shawarma plate and they forgot the garlic sauce. The dish isn't the same without it.   I am so disappointed in the delivery I will never support that location again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food is great and the variety is even better. The owner although he now has over 5 restaurants to manage he still visits the different stores and goes around the table checking on clients and making sure people are satisfied with the quality of food served. This behavior goes a very long way. Keep it up and you will continue to do well and grow!!!"}
{"text":"Eaten here for lunch and dinner on a few occasions and even got them catered for a work lunch at the office. Probably the best thing in the Yonge-dundas area other than Kenzo.  Best things in Paramount are the pita, the falafel and the moutabbal (eggplant and tahini). Clean, fresh food with accommodating and genuine servers.   Not so great - the fries, the inconsistent grilled meat and the desserts which used to be amazing. The fries tend to be undercooked, the meat can be dry and the desserts range in freshness.  But I love the atmosphere and the service. And honestly, fresh flavorful falafels (say that 5 times fast) are pretty rare downtown  so I will be back."}
{"text":"I passed by this placed and noticed it gets quite busy whenever I'm around the area, so I thought since its a packed house, it should be good. Its rare I eat Middle Eastern food, but I thought what the hay. Got lucky, went in and got a table right away.  Lots of choices and variety, and also a LOT of Middle Easterners speaking shish kabob dialec. j/k =)  My gf and I ordered some items. Started with their eggplant dip which is convenient b/c they give you two bowling ball size bread for free with it. Its actually quite soft and enjoyable. The eggplant was alright. Its healthy I guess, there was some pomegranate.   Next we ordered two different style pizza: one was beef with tomatoes and their style cheese, and the other was butter chicken with cheese. We both preferred and enjoyed the butter chicken.  We also ordered one of their wraps which was beef sausage that look like animal privates. haha and worst of all....it was DRY!!! I realize that a lot of them are hustling and working by clearing dishes and stuff, but it sure is hard to get their attention at times. We requested for the bill and pack some stuff, and we would not see anyone for a good 10-15 mins. Anywho, it was a nice experience, but we personally enjoyed the one in Scarborough! But for ppl in DT, its safe to dine here.  P/S: They have interesting songs to listen that is very up-lifting."}
{"text":"BY far the best shawarma i have ever had. Very flavourful, fresh ingredients  It's a hidden gem - random street around industrial buildings in Mississauga. However it seems there are a lot of ppl in the know on this place b/c it was packed on a random weekday at lunch (it's not a small place either - lots of seating inside and outside on patio)"}
{"text":"The only restaurant I've been to that has a Muslim prayer room, so you won't find any bacon/pork items here! I'm not muslim or Arabic, so this review will be from a native Canadian guy with little experience in middle eastern food.  I ordered a mix of items to sample the menu.The chicken shawarma meat was very good, but I've had similar quality/tasting chicken elsewhere. Nothing special. The same can be said about the charcoal cooked chicken chunks.  The salad was delicious. It tasted a little garlicky and quite lemony. It was the best thing I had at the restaurant.  The pita bread is made fresh and they provide a seemingly endless supply. It arrives at the table piping hot. To go with the bread, there is hummus that was also delicious."}
{"text":"I dined her numerous times with friends,one of the best middle Easter restaurant I've been to in the city. The staff is friendly and the food is great. My favourite dishes were falafel,lentil soup,freshly made in house pita bread,hummus and pizza! Yes I said it,the pizza is really good and I'm not talking about the traditional middle eastern kind. I would recommend this spot anytime."}
{"text":"Great looking renovation. Why is the food not better?? A disappointment in comparison with the now closed, unpretentious Messini. Paramount chicken kabobs are low quality in comparison. The garlic dip, which I did not like, had an artificial shine. Messini's dip was  more authentic. My Paramount meal included a pitiful dollop of green salad, covered with dark flecks. Messini was not exactly Cordon Bleu, but it was honest food, good value. The $7 Paramount juice is terribly sweet. I could not identify the cheesy topping."}
{"text":"The falafel is amazing here.. the best falafel i've had so far...  This is a cafeteria style restaurant.. you order your food and give them your table number. Someone will bring you your food once it is ready. You can add other items to your order and just pay by giving your table number to the cashier before you leave.  Definitely my favourite place for Middle Eastern Food.... YUM!"}

When we were at this location, the owner was walkng around greeting customers and making sure they were good. I am not totally familiar with their menu and wasnt sure what some of the items were and he took the time to explain it to me and offered samples as well.  Definitely my favourite place for Middle Eastern Food.... YUM!"}
{"text":"You don't go to this spot for fries and  pizza and then complain on Yelp that the fries are unseasoned.    This spot is all about their fresh baked pita. Their hummus, falafel, chicken dishes etc.   This review may read like an ad. But trust for fairly inexpensive  eats in Yorkville this spot is the only way to go."}
{"text":"After tolerating a lot of hype about Paramount, I finally went to check it out with a craving for some good grilled skewers. Sadly, my craving is yet to be satiated.  FOOD: - Decent quantity for the price. Quality is a separate thing though, and Paramount doesn't meet my standards there. - We got the Kafta plate (spiced ground beef skewers) - 2 skewers, some middle-eastern style salad, french fries and 2 home-baked breads == good quantity - Beef skewers lacked spice or could have used some more flavour, french fries were soggy, and the veggies in the salad were turning brown (i know it's summer, but the developed world has adequate storage/cooling systems). The only good thing was that the beef skewers were hot, juicy and tender (not overtly dry).  - We also got some dessert (baklava and its cousins) - was oily (not uncommon) and left a \"interesting\" greasy feel in my mouth (I would have preferred the bland beef as the lingering taste).  - The highly acclaimed \"Paramount Special Juice\" was summoned; was good = very different. Quite sugary = not healthy. You be the judge based on your juice preferences (filling, good taste, new experience // sugary, filling you up with unhealthy calories)  Food rating: 2/5  PRICE: - Really good price for the quantity = kafta plate (quantity described above) was $12, 4 pieces of dessert for $2, Juice is a little pricey (5-6 bucks) but is really filling. 2 people shared the juice, 1 entre and 4 pcs of dessert. - You choose where you spend your money - quantity or quality  Price rating: 4/5  DECOR: - typical middle-eastern eatery ambience = loud arabic music, old diner-style tables etc. But then, I doubt people go to middle eastern places with 2 $ signs on Yelp for the decor.  Decor rating: 3/5  SERVICE: - Was fast enough for me. Went with little expectations.   Service rating: 4/5  OVERALL RATING: 2/5 (Everything was okay except the food, hence the low rating).   Why to go there: - Quick, cheap mediocre food that will fill you up - Downtown location (which however has many other middle-eastern fooderies that I still have to experiment with)  Why not to go there: - If you want really good middle-eastern food  (Although I'm not a big fan of Bamiya Kababs - read my other review; I feel that Bamiya definitely surpasses Paramount in terms of kababs etc. Note - Bamiya is Afghan, but I guess it's kinda similar) - Don't take your date there unless you want a cheap way of parting ways."}
{"text":"Conflicted on the rating because the food is fantastic but the service is really terrible.   I understand that Arabic customs are different but the first few minutes in this always-packed restaurant are really frustrating. Its a while before you get seated and no menus nor instructions are given. You have to then go to the cashier and order. How, when you don't have a menu? I'm not sure, but I grabbed one and took it to my table out of frustration.   I was there with the family and we ordered the big BBQ platter. Came with three type of meats and all of them were perfectly grilled to absolute perfection. There was hummus included a plate of fries that only arrived half way through our meal and drinks but only if you ask at the front.   What really pissed me off was the waiters. These highschoolers practically threw the food on the table and ran for their next order. I asked for bread three times and kept waiting for it for 20 minutes before getting up and asking.   In conclusion. Great food but the service is absolutely awful. You won't have anything your way unless you ask them serveral times, no matter how much you're paying."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Pita with no dip ? Different servers stopped by the table too many times to ask if everything was OK. They were also too anxious to clear plates. There was no lineup but we felt rushed. $ 18 for two overcooked lamb kebabs was a bit pricey too. Falafel was tasty. We took home two baklava and they were reasonably priced and tasty. Servers were all very pleasant  but trying too hard. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"More a 2.5 but I'm being generous.  Went with my wife today and we were there for an hour.  I made reservations but still that wasn't sufficient to get a table immediately.  Had to wait to get seated.  Then, the table we were assigned wasn't even clean.  There were no plates, no cutlery, no napkins prepared...NOTHING!  What's the point of making a reservation?  The appetizer and manakeesh were provided promptly and were delicious.  Had to wait for water.  Fresh pita bread was provided and it was satisfying while we waited for our main course...WHICH NEVER ARRIVED!  I went up twice to the order counter to question its whereabouts.  What's worse: several other tables who were seated after us were served their meals -- appetizers, mains and drinks.  The only thing separating us from them appeared to be the fact we didn't speak Arabic.    After waiting for another 30 minutes, my wife and I left.  The only saving grace was the gentleman who appeared to be the manager, Hussain.  He was apologetic and discounted the manakeesh.  Otherwise, service was awful and terribly lacking!  P.S. We ended up going to Symposium cafe and restaurant just up the street.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We were seated within 5 minutes, eventhough it was a packed house and we didn't have reservations.  Food was decent enough.  Bottom Line: have gone to Paramount several times and have no intentions of returning.  You can do better if looking for a halal, healthy option.  See Bamiyan!"}
{"text":"There are far better places to get shawarma than Paramount. This chain is dying with their overpriced/underfilled plates. This location was not able to get my take out order right, on top of that the fries taste worse than frozen Walmart fries. I advise you to stay away and go to a local shawarma joint instead."}
{"text":"The interior is great and find this location more open than the other one's we've been to. It's conveniently located at heartland town center. The service here could be a little better, it just didn't feel par for paramount service. We ordered the Arayes and mini mixed grill patter. The arayes was good and had a little more meat stuffing than the other locations. On the mixed grill platter the kafta and shish touk were good but the beef kababs were not great. Also the hummus that came with the platters looked a little stale as it had a crusty look. We just had the hummus that we ordered as extra for the table. The pita was brought to our table long before the hummus was brought out. By the time the hummus was out the pita was cold. No one came by to offer a fresh basket which is very normal practice for paramount. In all because of the service and in consistent food I'm giving them a 3."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I'd give it 3 stars at best.  Other reviews are correct on the pita. Freshly made in house, it's the best I've ever had but unfortunately best on their menu. The rest of the food is a hit or miss. They have good seasoning but the quality in general lags. They also don't serve your entire table at once so while you wait for your mates to get their food, yours has gone cold."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for a small party of 15-20 people. Ordering was easy, straightforward. Management and staff were helpful and friendly. Food quantity was great and the quality was excellent. Great value for $. My guests were thrilled and we'll definitely do business with Paramount Yonge & Eglinton again."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad I had. Add chicken on top. Yummy! Gorgeous place. My friend had Fattoush Salad and chicken and was very happy with her choice too. Salads were fresh and had a great taste. meat was well grilled and sauce for pita was with garlic, terrific.  The smell of a nice bbq all around the area brought us in. It was only 12 bucks! And complementary fresh baked pitas was unexpected and fully eaten. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.   Came by yesterday to order $200 of food for a friend's birthday picnic in the park. The food was...ugh, just awful. Tabbouleh was barely chopped up, so lots of giant pieces of parsley, very dry. The lebnah - which is pressed yogurt and supposed to be solid - was runny like a soup. It was disgusting. The hummus tasted fermented, i.e., it had gone bad. The meat was dry. The falafels were meh. Fries soggy. It was all garbage.   Please steer way clear of this location! I would normally recommend a better alternative if I'm going to diss a place, but there really isn't anything good in the area as far as middle eastern food goes. Better off Googling (or Yelping!) spots in Scarborough or a bit further north of the downtown core."}
{"text":"This location is the best out of the three I've tried(Thornhill and Toronto).   Service: After you place your order at the counter, the food comes out pretty quickly. The servers come by regularly to check up on your table asking if you need a refill or more bread. The managers usually go by every table and ask how is the food.   Food: The price has been going up every year by a dollar or so which I still find reasonable. The portion especially the dinner plate is pretty generous. I can never finish one on my own and usually split with another person. One dinner plate and 1-2 appetizer usually fills me and another up. I've tried all the meat options here and it is all delicious and juicy! My favourite is the beef shawarma and kafta kebab. I recommend the zaatar manakeesh. How can plain pita, oil and seasoning be so tasty?! The baklava taste like your standard baklava so not much to rave about."}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews but I had to this time. The food was delicious and authentic, and the restaurant was super clean. We had the nicest waiter, Hassan, who really made my group feel comfortable. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food. Large variety of selections.  Free mint coffee. So many pastry choices. Prompt service. reasonably priced. But gets pretty busy on Sundays."}
{"text":"I have been to Paramount in Hamilton and Mississauga. Good experience.  This one had many rough patches.   Lunch at 130pm. Not busy but my order lost or at served 15 minutes after my  companion received hers.  Staff were friendly but frequently intrusive. ... refilling salt shakers..resetting the table while we ate. Interupting conversation every 5 minutes to ask how we were.  No apology for late food."}
{"text":"Food: 1 Atmosphere: 1 Service: 1 Location: 1  Would give a 0 if I could. Came here for a super quick after-work dinner. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Firstly, I was sat at the bar because I was by myself, which is okay, no harm no foul... but their wait staff kept walking into me and knocking my coat off my chair.  So I took a hint and moved my coat to the empty chair next to me... still kept getting walked into, mind you the walkway by the door is about 5 feet wide and was empty... so, no real reason to keep walking into me. I eventually got impatient and asked for the wait staff to stop walking into me.. Which they acknowledged, yet kept doing! I was sheepishly asked if I wanted water by their really young bar-back who then gave me room temperature water in a half filled cup... :)... Great... I requested a lemon wedge for my water and was then given lemons that had sat out for so long the white part of the rind had dried out and started to shrivel.......ON A CRUMPLED NAPKIN!................  Food was mediocre at best... got some kind of lamb dinner which actually was about 3 cups of rice, 2 overcooked lamb skewers and some wilted iceberg lettuce and a tomato slice sprinkled with bruised parsley.. this was accompanied by hummus in a little takeaway cup (see: McDonalds ketchup pump receptacle) and two huge pieces of bread. The bread was the best/freshest part but due to the tablespoon of hummus I was given, half was not eaten. The meal literally ends up being 80% carbs...   Do not eat here if you value even a single aspect of a positive dining experience. I literally p***ed away $30. As I was paying I let one of the 473753975 service staff know I had an awful dining experience and was met with apathy. Cool. Won't be back, I hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to eat Middle Eastern food so we found this place. we waited to be seated, a server brought us to a table as we were sitting down he quickly mentioned something pointing out a direction. I thought he was pointing out where the washrooms are, I smiled and nodded. My girlfriend said, I think he said \"when you're ready to order it would be over there\" I asked another server we're ready to order, she said the same thing I couldn't believe it. it's a restaurant not a fast-food restaurant. we were given a menu, they brought bread but yet I had to walk to a small corner with the menu where there was one guy taking everyone's orders. waited about 7 minutes to order. I told him my table number and ordered. I asked the guy, why do people have to order here, it's weird he said it's faster this way. I told him this is a restaurant I shouldn't be walking around to order my food this is extremely weird. the people behind me we're all laughing and agreeing with me. throughout the time we were there people coming in were confused when they were told about the ordering method.  I've been to all kinds of restaurants in my life, I've never been to a restaurant like this. I thought the food might be good since there are so many people inside.....I've had better food at Villa Madina inside food courts. I ordered kabobs with rice and girlfriend ordered chicken shawarma with rice. my food was bland and the shawarma had curry taste."}
{"text":"very appropriate name...the quality/freshness/originality of this place are paramount.  Don't think twice, go there. And don't worry, it is busy but they can deliver it very fast. At least they did today whilst the place was packed full (labour day!)   Only problem: one bill table, so if you are with people with very different habits (say one orders only a hummus and someone else goes for 3-courses) you will have problem splitting the bill."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast service, friendly people.  Great atmosphere. The three dips as appetizer are huge. The salads fresh and scrumptious."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Chicago & just had dinner at Paramount this evening. Lovely Lebanese cuisine with yummy hummus, falafel & zaatar. Having lived in the Middle East, we crave for authentic Lebanese food & this comes super close!   The one thing that could've been better was the khubz (pita) which was really hard & dry. Authentic pita should be warm, soft & spongy!   Nevertheless, 4 stars for the awesome food & pleasing demeanour of our waiter!"}
{"text":"Vibe is super casual, it's like a cafeteria more than a restaurant inside. The complementary pita bread is fresh and tasty. I got the chicken shawarma plate. Mmmmm the garlic sauce is to die for. I'd come back again just for the sauce."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once, its different than your ordinary restaurant. The host brings you to the table with your menus, you walk up to the cashier and order and tell them your table number. It was super confusing as first. The food is amazing! I absolutely love the atmosphere, everyone is nice!"}
{"text":"I waited 1hr for my meal.  Unacceptable.  Amazing customer service has branded the Mississauga location and made them successful.  I was seriously disappointed with this location.  I wasn't the only one.  Birthday celebration was left sour.  The manager didn't have the courtesy to apologies for the inconvenience.  I hope they change."}
{"text":"I love the food here! Great customer service and amazing food. I love the hummus and garlic sauce. :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice, servers are friendly.  The food is good except that they put way too much garlic.   Ps: breads are delicious, as they come fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"Great food and I love the newly renovated place. Unfortunately, the customer service has come down. I'm a regular and every time we go,  there are new faces. I missed the Filipino workers that were really friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The food is great,  specially the freshly baked bread. The shawarma are a little salty and the amount of meeat on the plate is a lot less than before. The service is terrible,  the lady who's cleaning the table took my plate before I  even finish eating without asking me. I may go back and try again,  I  really like going to the original restaurant on dixie and eglington area."}
{"text":"Shawarma was cold, falling apart and small. They also had NO ONIONS!!! Which shawarma place doesn't have onions? This location is BAD. I still like other locations though. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and it seems like the customer service is on the decline. We arrived and were seated right away and waited about 15 minutes for our order to arrive. I had ordered a fattoush salad and halfway through discovered a nasty surprise! A medium sized clear plastic piece of a container was in the middle of my salad. Of course my appetite was immediately gone, and I mentioned the issue to one of the waitresses when she came by to refill water. She sent the manager over who asked if she could get me a new salad but I declined. I thought it was nice of them to ask at least.  Not a great experience overall unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had chicken shawarma over fattoush salad. Chicken had cartilage and skin it was disgusting. I guess that's what you get when you have non Lebanese ppl running a Lebanese restaurant"}
{"text":"I beg to differ with the reviewer who criticised the hot sauce. It's not a bottled sauce and doesn't look like what you get other places. It's a roasted pepper sauce that has way more flavour than sriracha or tobasco. I love it! My new favourite combination is the chicken shawarma plate with rice and the tabouli. I mix it all together with a bit of hot sauce and a bit of garlic sauce.Not terribly pretty, but delicious! I have tried the fattoush in the past and found it to be one of the worst I have ever had, but that is my only complaint over the many times I have picked up take-out here."}
{"text":"Came to Paramount on Mavis after having a terrible experience at the Crestlawn location. The service, food quantity, table side manners, and waiting service is very commendable!  We met Maria after our supper and told her about our poor experience - she assured us the Mavis location will always put their best foot forward!  Honestly, I will not go to a different location, I will come to the Mavis location, no question about it!   The waiters kept the pitas coming in as needed (we needed seconds) and refilled out waters - they asked us how we liked our meal after, and all of this was much more than I expected!  The quantity was on point - my previous visit to the crestlaen location had an obvious difference between the menus pictures and the plate served. This was not the case here - abundance of lettus, turnips, pickles, and meat served! I really enjoyed it!  While you do pay a premium to eat at Paramount, you will truly get your money's worth here in terms of service and quantity. 5/5 stars, no question about it!"}
{"text":"Arrived super hungry. Received more than expected. Left full and ready for a nap. Tables are really small if your appetite is big. Be mindful of what you order."}
{"text":"I've been to other Paramounts and this one was by far the worst by a mile... Will never return to the Crestlawn location again!  Here's the short and tall of it:  - was not served waters or offered drinks - had to request it twice - waited 20 minutes for pitas and water - pitas didn't come until the mains came - they brought each main separately - 15 minutes to serve food - all the other Paramounts do it quicker - servers standing around socializing - was not checked up on until we were done - no offers to refill water - prices have gone up - salad wasn't a salad, it was a garnish - there's a quantity gap between menu and what's served. See the photos.   That bring said, food quality was about the same as the restaurants. However, I'm not here for take out, and I really expected more from Paramount. Extremely disappointing.   Will not come here again."}
{"text":"Very proud to have a restaurant like this in toronto, authentic, great food and fabulous service. We had tabouli, taaouk and falafel, loved it all!!! Will visit more often. Thank you"}
{"text":"Very bad service . Staff very unprofessional and no management around to watch what's going on .  It was supposed to be a family night, turned out to be a big disappointment"}
{"text":"I've been to many paramount locations and have had excellent food. This particular location was always a little to be desired as the food is often dry, they run out of stock on common items like whole chicken. Recently my family and I ordered mixed grill among other items and everyone got food poisoning. This location is by far much worse and not the same quality as the other locations of paramount, it must have different ownership. The service was also horrible and dis-organized."}
{"text":"Didn't like it , menu is rich but food doesn't reflect the real Middle East flavors. And it's over rated and over priced.  Beef shawarma has nothing to do with shawarma , it's simply sizzled beef."}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber eats ( falafel plate, chicken shawarma plate, beef shawarma wrap) in general not bad, though our chicken shawarma plate had only remnants of chicken, actually  looked like chicken was placed over the rice and then remove, traces of chicken really. Will not order again."}
{"text":"Best desert counter I have seen anywhere.. Great coffee and kebabs too. 4.5 of 5. Everything is made on site. The Baklava is sold by weight you can Mix and match. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Paramount is good but not amazing. The fattoush salad was OK but it had to much lime juice. The hot pita bread is probably the highlight of this place. Although the location is big, the tables are quite small and really close to each other, so it gets kind of uncomfortable if you are wearing a coat or sharing food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food; not what i was expecting. The $20 lamb dish i ordered had lamb from a skew with no taste, the few pieces of shredded salad looked like something out of a bag, and the rice was bland sine it lacked any ingredient like safaron, oil, nuts."}
{"text":"Wow.  I have to change my review. Returned today again (after a bad visit a month ago) and I cannot believe how downhill they've gone. Service was abysmal, food expensive (my salad with chicken Sharma was pathetically small-sized, wrapped Sharmas have shrunk incredibly, and we had to ask - and then wait for  - water and utensils long after our food arrived separately.  The side of the puff-ball pita never arrived until our bill came?! Too bad.  They were so good and now they are equally as bad.  I'll never return again. Would give it a 1/2 star if I could(see my old review from last year as follows - it's no longer the case:  \"We have now been there three times. Each visit the food was delicious, freshly prepared, and the service was excellent. They serve very large portions, so be careful when ordering.  The beef shawarma was a bit dry, chicken shawarma was perfect. Hummus was good, but the mattabal (baba ghanoush) was much better, with a lovely smoky aftertaste. Goes great with the large, freshly baked puff-ball pita bread they serve.   The coffee has a nice cardamon taste and the arabic sweets pair well.  Definitely worth trying! And very inexpensive\")."}
{"text":"I went there the first night and arrived few minutes before they are supposed to close, and they told we they were closed, despite the fact that someone just in front of me was ordering to go. I went back the second night way before closing time, and they told me they were closed for an emergency. Someone was just paying for a to go order in front of me, and they said I cannot even order to go. I asked what was the emergency and could not get an answer. I do not know what emergency would prevent them from giving me something to go. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Tabbouleh is great,fast service. They bring you freshly baked pita,hot from oven,not in plastic bag. Labneh was good,chicken shawarma above average. They were out of lot of the sweets,yet I managed to get an ice cream. I have visited a few locations,food is consistent & service varies a bit. Good Lebanese fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to both their Crestlawn and downtown Toronto location twice.  I pretty much order the same things all the time - moussaka, falafel and/or lentil soup. had been eagerly anticipating this branch to open as it was closer to home.  finally made it tonight, a saturday.  arrived before 7pm and the front entrance was already packed with people and we had to get our name on the waiting list. after 15-20 minutes, got seated but got up to order right away since we knew what we wanted by then.  there were 3 cashiers but for some reason the line wasn't moving as fast as i expected (people couldn't decide)?  so ordered moussaka, lentil soup and mixed grill plus the paramount special drink.  i guess the place was so loud, the cashier didn't hear me say lentil soup so it never arrived.  checked my bill and it wasn't there.  no big deal since the mixed grill was huge and my husband shared it with me. the not so nice thing though is that 2 seconds after i sat down (after ordering and paying at the cashier), the mixed grill arrived.  we were so surprised.  the food was clearly sitting and waiting for assembly as it wasn't even hot. when my moussaka came, it was good.  but there was a COLD SPOT.  i guess they didn't MICROWAVE it long enough? over all we were disappointed since we expected the food to be prepared fresh and not just reheated. oh and when i got up to get dessert, i didn't have exact change so i had to line up at the cashier again to pay.  so inefficient."}
{"text":"This is probsbly thr best arabic restaurant in downtown toronto near Gundas square. Their fresh right out of the oven is a huge plus..snd come with every entree. Very affordable clean snd food fresh"}
{"text":"We usually frequent the Erin Mills/Eglinton W location but had a chance to have lunch at this location recently. The food quality is same as of the other locations I have dined at - my first experience with Paramount was at their Yonge street location. Since it is a newly setup branch, there are some teething problems which would be resolved soon (hopefully). The owner/manager was vigilant, keeping an eye around the functioning. Our server forgot to provide water but she did that quickly once she realized. There were no cookies at this location yet but I was told they should be here soon (we had dined 15 days back). Overall, great food - authentic Lebanese not fabricated to Western standards like some of the middle eastern chains are. Desserts were great and it was my first time trying a Shabiyat. Kinafe was great as usual!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place to eat.  I've only had the pleasure of dropping by to this place for a coffee & snack.  The coffee & cappuccino is good.  The pastry are very good & the selection is great too.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I was overcharged for an extra chicken skewer I was led to believe (aka the server flat out lied to me) that I had received even though it never came. The poor service i can tolerate; the deception is another story. I will never be coming back and I encourage all to steer clear"}
{"text":"Was happy to see a new option in Yorkville and so we headed there for a casual dinner at 6pm on the weekend. First disappointment, they ran out of hummus. How is that even possible? Second, the food except for the bread and dip were subpar at best. I have gone to both their other branches and the quality and service was comparable poorer here. Overcook meat, dry to the bone, cut poorly and falafel hard as a rock. Third, tabula salad was not fresh and over saturated with vinegar. To top it all off, air condition seem to not be working on a hot summer day, so we were also steaming and sweating throughout the meal. Service was also horrible. I really hope they improve otherwise i recommend to head a little further east to \"eat-a-pita\" which has much better service and quality."}
{"text":"Great falafels, awesome piping hot fresh pita straight from the oven, FRESH harissa, a full on bakery with a multitude of choices of baklava (and cookies)...not to mention the cheap prices!!! The zaatar manakeesh - so fresh and yummy. The hummus is the best - creamy and fresh.   Can I keep saying fresh over and over again?  We love this place...I am getting hungry for Paramount just writing this review.   Another awesome plus - the cleanliness. They also have ample seating which is good because every time we've been there its been packed.  Another bonus - the staff there are just nice and they have free coffee for their customers :)"}
{"text":"The service I received was HORRIBLE.  The waitress brought 3 of the 4 meals out to my table.  About 15-20 minutes later I still never received my meal and my friends were pretty much done eating.  I told the waitress to cancel my order and she barely appologized as she walked away.   She didn't care at all!  The best part was that out of the 4 meals that were ordered, my falafel was probably the easiest to make.  I would never come here again or recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food. But it's overpriced. Two take out falafel plates with a side tabbouleh salad was 27$ with tax. That's silly. It's falafel and salad. My advice is don't do take out. Dine in is fine but pricey. I've been there twice where my take order got screwed up (missing an item and small portions). Best just to dine in. Also the take out system seems disorganized. Food tastes great and the staff are very nice. Just dine in and expect to pay a bit more for middle eastern food here."}
{"text":"Would not go back. Bland and  dry food, not authentic. Cafeteria style dining at its best. Not impressed. Fatoush salad is a true disappoint with greasy chunks of pita on an iceberg salad."}
{"text":"Worst service! Prices are like hell high! Dont know why ppl r going there to give money for rubbish. Asked waiteress to give hummus dip with pitas. Nothing cane may b she didnt care to pass the instructions Shishtauk plate had more fries than chicken lolz Chicken shewerma very dry ! Will not go to any paramount just high price n good place to eat thts it. Will go to a place tht is small but taste better"}
{"text":"Worst food ever... Me and my husband went today there.. We ordered kafta kabob and beef and chicken shawarma and shish touk. The kafta was fine but the shawarma was very very hard which clearly showed that it was not fresh at all !!!! The quantity was also very less as compared to the first time we came there when it recently opened. Ok also the pita was very hard and burnt from top. I asked the waitress to change it , she brought again and it was hard again.... The humus was also not up to date... Again quantity was less. I m still feeling heavy and bad Will never go there again for sure!! As for such a high price the quality is poor!"}
{"text":"Most all red meats are dry and a little too rare...Chicken was missing flavor a little...  Not to say this location is pricy too..."}
{"text":"Great hot pita and hummus dip. When we came there it was quite busy so service was lacking and orders got mixed up. Kefta was delicious but the beef shwarma was dry."}
{"text":"DO NOT go to this place thinking it's the same as another paramount you went to outside of the airport. This is coming from a loyal paramount customer who has visited 90% of the of the paramounts outside. You are going to pay more (understandable since it's inside the airport) and you WILL NOT get ANYTHING close to what you got outside, quality and quantity. I actually run into the CEO often (because I am there at least once a week), and I will make sure he knows about this, as I really don't think he does. This is beyond ridiculous. The manager here was like \"this is what it is!\"  Save your money and eat at the swiss chalet next doors, or even don't eat at all."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and now has also started to offer breakfast.  Honestly I think it is a bit overrated.  I mean I do like the place but I definitely think they need to make some changes with their side condiments and a few items.   Love the warm bread, shish taouk and their manakeesh. Not a big fan of the Shawarma here.  They do not have hot sauce,  I mean really?  Not even tobasco.  The server will give you a tomato paste kind of container which they call hot sauce.    The drinks ( smoothies)  are all sugar and do not even  taste that good."}
{"text":"Good food overall as noted by others.  Be warned it's cafeteria style with self order and thus dont give over a 3 star as the full dining experience cannot be had."}
{"text":"the food was cold and was served very late. Drinks were flat like. Really had a bad experience. Never going there ever again."}
{"text":"Really good food. Service was fast and ppl working here seemed to be enjoying their job. We ordered the half family platter and the manakesh as a vegetarian dish. Could easily have fed four to five people. Meat was well done."}
{"text":"LOVEEE THEIR GARLIC SAUCE! That's the reason I go there! Overall the food is good, portions are big and staff are friendly. Great to casual dining"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mixed Grill, with rice. The lamb and chicken skews had 4 burnt small pieces of meat, and the beef skew was the thinnest skew I've ever seen also burnt as well. Extremely poor quality and very over priced for what you get. Will never go back."}
{"text":"What a delightful and delicious experience. Had dinner with the family and we had a blast. The atmosphere was relaxing. The service impeccable. The food wow so fresh so good. Will definitely be coming back ."}
{"text":"Satisfaction. Guaranteed.  Great food at great prices. It's always packed here but somehow they usually find a place for you.  Service: It's truly a hit or miss. I don't think they have quite worked out the right combination or formula for staff in peak rush hours or otherwise. We sometimes get served right on time and sometimes have to remind them again and again and... but really, the food DOES make up for it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Food: They bring steaming hot breads to your table as soon as you are seated or they remember -whichever comes first. You have to poke wholes in the bread to let the steam out and yes, you will burn yourself but its good. I recommend having it with hummus - which you have to order.  Dinner plates with rice or fries are available with most of their entrees. Shawarma plate or just the sandwich is really great but my personal favourite would be Shish Tawouk over the shawarma. Tender pieces of perfectly marinated chicken breast - perfection! And it's even better as a take away if you grill it at home before having it - they don't grill the sandwiches at the restaurant.  I have tried some of their pizzas which are good as well and make you feel less guilty than having a giant slice of thick crust oozing with cheese regular slice of pizza. They come in a few different flavours.   Another great dish is a chick pea dish on the appetizer menu which is available only on weekends. It is really delicious - a must try.  Desserts: Try it all!   I go there on a weekly basis - its great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"We had a very good experience at this location, all the meals we ordered tasted great and baklava was fresh and yummy, it worths every penny. The server was polite and friendly, we will go back very soon with our friends."}
{"text":"This joint is pretty hopping with Middle Easterners, which is a great thing because it definitely scores high on authenticity.  Their shawermas, kebabs and salads are very tastey, as are the sauces that accompany them (the garlic and the hot).  My favourite thing about this restaurant is that they serve fresh made to order pita breads; so fresh, they come out poofy!  The ordering system works weird.  First you seat yourself and check the table number.  Second, you walk to the ordering station and place your orders.  Finally, the waitresses and waitors will deliver your goodies to your table.  The parking here a disaster, so prepared.  One odd thing though:  Everyone who ate here with me, got sick.  :(  For a few days, we all had dodgey tummies."}
{"text":"I got take out (falafel, tabouleh and grape leaves) and it was fantastic! I was surprised that it isn't a sit down place...it's fast casual without full service, but it still has a nice feel to it. I would happily go back to dine in house. Portions are generous and the prices were good. Takeout was extremely fast - ready in about 5 minutes. Some of the best food I've had in the area."}
{"text":"I was at this location just after it opened. It's a gorgeous restaurant, very high end.  The layout is great, the food was awesome as usual and the people that work there are smiling and happy.  I've eaten at many of the Paramount restaurants and I find that the quality of food is very consistent.  You always can count on great, fresh middle eastern food.  The prices are very reasonable and I guarantee that you will leave with a satisfied stomach, the portions are AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Thornhill paramount several times. It's usually pretty busy. This place serves great middle eastern food that is fresh and halal. Shwarma's are awesome, so is the lamb and the pita bread with the garlic sauce is to die for!!! If you haven't been, you have to try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice decor and much nicer than the other locations.  Food was good but not knock your socks off unfortunately; I have had better.  The service was ok but the waitress did seem a bit unpleasant.    And when our meals arrived; I asked for some hot sauce and I was given a tiny plastic container with hot sauce that really wasn't spicy at all.  When we asked for our bill I was shocked!!!  They charged me 50 cents !!!   This is a eat in restaurant...completely unheard of.  I have never been charged for hot sauce my entire life.  That is terrible to nickle and dime customers for 50 cents for a condiment that should be standard part of any meal.  Needless to say I will not go back."}
{"text":"What I had: Humus, BBQ beef platter and one of the pizza.  All I can say is bland bland bland.  There is nothing more to say.  Humus didn't taste like anything, didn't have enough salt or garlic or even chickpeas. The meat on the platter was dry, dry and dry.  The pizza had hala spam.  I can't imagine this ever being good.  If you know whats good for you just skip this and go to Ibrahim's at Lawrence and Warden."}
{"text":"LOVED!!! This location is awesome. The food and service far surpass all other paramount locations I have tried. The only reason I'm giving this four stars and not five is for the lack of consistency in the food. It's not hugely inconsistent but enough to notice. Still though, the food is fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of their baklava - it's a little too clumpy? It's just not flaky and nutty enough. But their falafel and zatar with cheese is delicious.  This location is kept very clean and the customer service is fantastic. The other locations could definitely learn a few things about how to treat customers.  Can't wait to go back for the zatar with cheese - it's my favourite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there last night. More locations. Equals less traffic. Better service. Also less food orders means more time for the chefs to concentrate on your order. Very happy. The manakeesh was the best I have ever had there. Now that customers have branched off. I was so happy with every single part of my visit last night. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Used to be really good, and the prices were cheap for the area. It's now hit or miss and they've expanded across the GTA with locations everywhere. It gets 3 stars mostly for the fluffy pillow bread."}
{"text":"When this location opened I was ecstatic. It's right around the corner from my house. However it has been nothing but a disappointment. Being overpriced is just part of the issue here. I'm actually more disappointed with the food. I went there today and ordered the Zaatar Manakish, which used to be fabulous. All I got is a pice of dough with a hint of Zaatar on the top.   You can charge premium prices, although it is not a premium restaurant, but just don't be cheap with the food."}
{"text":"We (2) visited this location for the first time.  Stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for over 5 minutes.  Several employees passed by, but did not assist.  Eventually some told us \"anywhere you like\".  We sat, waited about 10 minutes, nobody came to get our order so we went to the take-out counter.  After another significant wait our order was taken (Beef Shawarma Wrap and a Chicken Shawarma Wrap).  It was made and presented quickly.  We started eating and discovered how small the Shawarma was.  The one positive thing I have to say is that it was good - lots of garlic!  The 2 wraps cost just over $14 and we were still hungry.  Considering how poor the service was and the small portions, we will never visit again."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing special. They were blasting CHFI radio during dinner. Seriously?! Turn it OFF. Silence would be better than listening to ads while eating."}
{"text":"Good food around the Eaton Centre sounds like an anomaly, until you've discovered and dined at Paramount.  I've been here a handful of times and the food is consistently delicious. Sure you might have to wait a while before getting a table, sure the place is cramped to the max, but it all adds to the charm and hustle and bustle of the place.  I always get the Shish Tawouk. It's honestly the juiciest and most tender piece of chicken you'll get anywhere. So juicy in fact that the pita lying underneath it absorbs all the chickeny juices, thus becoming one of the most desired items to eat on the plate. Yes, I just said chickeny!  The accompanying garlic sauce is rad. I don't know how they manage to accomplish that mousse like texture, but it's exceptional. The hot sauce looks fiery but is quite mild, make sure you ask your server for a side of it, because it's quite necessary.  Falafels are nom worthy, as is the hummus. Pitas are complementary and are brought to your table freshly baked and poofy like a balloon.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Liked the place and food. Wished they came back to refill the water, but im sure they'd do it had i asked. Will come back."}
{"text":"I went at this paramount two days after they opened to check it out. The place was clean, staff were friendly, desert looked amazing and the lay out of the tables were definitely night and day from the one downtown.   I ordered a chicken shawarma, and I had the tiniest little petit wrap I've ever seen. Although their chicken is delicious, it isn't worth leaving hungry every time you order a wrap, moreover, I won't order twice something that elsewhere I would be fine with just one (unless it was beyond delicious). At Pita Land for example, just down the street, the shawarma is delicious, twice the size.  Besides that, it was not the first time that they used some twisted system to trick people when they order, you ask EVERYTHING and they DON'T put everything you would expect from a shawarma ( chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickled turnips, onions) you have to list the ingredients one by one. I'm aware some costumers don't eat this or that and the business may be playing it safe. But it's also the business choice when someone orderers everything, to make sure they are aware of everything other than just putting couple ingredients and call it \"everything\". This is confusing and I always leave with the feeling that something is missing. Things somehow are just not clear in this regard."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. I was served the wrong food and the staff seemed unprepared for the high volume of customers.   The chicken shawarma plate was small in portion size, with no included salad or garlic sauce. And the chicken seemed to be minced, like it was leftover.  The falafel sandwich was dry, with little added sauce and tough and difficult to chew. I would strongly not recommend dining here."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We had grilled lamb plate, veggie pizza and chicken pizza. It's very similar to the kind of middle eastern food you get anywhere else in Toronto, not worse, not better, was pretty ok. The juice was amazing, especially the paramount special with crushed nuts and assorted fruits in it, was definitely the highlight of the meal. I loved the hot sauce. Like any restaurant, I judge them by how good their hot sauce is, and the hot sauce here is definitely a must try. Remember to ask for it early like before getting the big bloated bread.   Ideally, I would give them 3.5, but 3 star because 1. what's with using all the paper plates and plastic cups, we didn't get takeout because we were trying to be more enviournmentally friendly, so it was a huge disappointment when they served food using plasticware. 2. the service was slow, the girl who was taking care of our take was too busy with a lot of other tasks. so 5-2 stars."}
{"text":"Hailing from Arabian sands and now residing in Toronto, I was itching for some tasty Middle Eastern food, and that's exactly what I got! I had some errands to run near Dundas Square and so went to Paramount on my own. The staff was exceptionally friendly, sweet and courteous!   I had limited time and just wanted a quick bite. I just had a kafta wrap and was very satisfied. No doubt I'll be returning back for more..like some of the platters - Arayees and Shish Tawook particularly caught my eye.  Being the sweet tooth that I am, I couldn't leave without dessert, so I had a piece of Osmalieh- simply divine. A cake like dessert with a creamy dough inside and topped with a crispy texture with a whimsical blob of cream...YUM! I could even sense the other underlying flavours, subtle hints of chopped pistachio and rosewater (I think).   Friendly staff+Delicious food= I'd be crazy not to go back for more:)"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed when I ate here last weekend. My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish our food it was that awful. Which is sad because I've loved eating at their Yonge, Yorkville and other locations. This one at Sheppard seems to have fallen. The hummus was dry. I got the shawarma plate and it felt like I was eating wood chips. For now I'm going to stick with their other locations."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've visited Paramount, and back then I only knew of one location that was in Vaughan. Since then, I'm pleased to see that a few other locations have popped up throughout the GTA.   I popped in today with my family for Father's Day dinner. My dad went with a beef and chicken shawarma plate, my brother opted for a chicken souvlaki wrap and I chose the shish taouk.   We placed our order at the front till and returned to our table where we were served hot and fresh pita bread while we waited for our order to arrive. Staff was very attentive and were quick to bring more pita bread when none was left.   The meals came out reasonably quick. The shish taouk was delicious! Chicken was seasoned and grilled to perfection. I opted for fries to go with my meal (which comes with vegetables and pita bread for the chicken), though in retrospect I would much rather have chosen rice as my side dish.   All things considered, a great option for a nice quick meal! Lots more here that I'd love to try on future visits!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.  I ate dinner here at off peak hours, so I can't comment on the bad service that some of the previous experienced.  Being located right across from Eaton Centre, I was expecting expensive and less than authentic middle eastern cuisine.    As ridiculous as this sounds, in general, I equate the authenticity of a place with the level of decor, location, staff and patrons.  When eating ethnic, I tend of like places that have: less flash (I try not to pay for nice ambiance), non-tourist location (a restaurant that people make the trek to, not a place that just happens to be there), authentic staff (the worse the english, the better the food) and authentic patrons (i like to be the only patron who is non-*insert ethnicity* in the restaurant).  This place was almost the complete opposite of where I would typically eat.  I was pleasantly surprised though.   The food was very tasty (ordered the shwarma plates) and the free pita bread was baked in front of our eyes.  For a interesting seating area, sit at the back of the restaurant, right beside the window to the kitchen.  From these seats, you can watch them prepare the pita bread.  The decor is nice and clean.  The staff was attentive with perfect english, the patrons were a mixed bag of different ethnicity.     The prices are also exceptional value."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great, the chicken shish tawook was a bit bland for my taste, the servers were great but the food took a long time to get, it seemed like almost 30-40 mins.   The atmosphere was nice, every thing seem like it was just renovated. But the so called \"background music\" inside  was so loud, I couldn't really talk to someone.   It also seem like there little kids everywhere in the restaurant, they're running wild, screaming and crying and generally getting in the way of other customers and servers."}
{"text":"The food there is delicious, and the prices are good.   I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with white rice, side of lettuce, tomatoes, mixed pickles and a basket of homemade pita bread. The bread was straight from their wood burning oven!  I was expecting to get a small plate of food for my order, but when it arrived, I was surprised how much they gave me. I got a lot of chicken! The food tasted great, and I had to get a take-out container since I got so much food. What a good deal compared to other restaurants of similar quality.   I would recommend this place to my family and friends. I hope to go back again many times."}
{"text":"Cafeteria?  No... Fast food?  Not really... Restaurant?  Yeah... Yummy?  YES!!!  So you get table with the hostess and they give you menus to order from.  And then you have to go up and order at the order desk and give them your table number so they know where to deliver your food.    We went with hummus to share, chicken shwarma plate, chicken shish taouk platter, and a strawberry mango drink.  This came out to around $ 45.00 for the two of us....I was like, \"Wha?! Uh...okay, debit?\"  It seemed expensive for a place that had me ordering at a counter like a fast food place.   But then the food arrived...first the complimentary pita pillowy and steamy from the oven.  I realized early on that the bread is unlimited so eat up!  My chicken shish taouk was DELISH!  The chicken shwarma was equally as good, but the complaint was that it was a smaller portion than what he's used to.  GARLIC SAUCE.  Way creamy, way indulgent, it elevates your meal to a whole new level.    If you have kids, there's a play area where they can run around and burn off the falafels they just inhaled while you enjoy some more pita and garlic sauce.  And then maybe some tea and baklava.    The service was great-we had 3 different people stop by and ask if we were enjoying our meal.  One girl asked if we needed hot sauce but we were nearly done and didn't even think of it so we told her, \"Oh!  We didn't know!  Next time.\"  She comes back with two hot sauces, one to enjoy now and one to take home.  Impressive.  Impression made.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my new lunch spot. Since they opened a few months ago, I have tried every sandwich on the menu. My favourites are the lamb and chicken schwarmas. The lamb is tender and smoky from the grill. The chicken is moist and, hopefully, has some crispy bits thrown in. Any of the manakeesh from the giant wood burning oven in the back are awesome. And it's all cheap, cheap, cheap. You can easily get out of here for less than a tenner for lunch.  The only low point here is the service. Both takeout and eat-in service is atrocious. For takeout, they make you wait in the main runway for servers, so you're constantly dancing around to let them pass. However, even the bad service won't make me stop coming here."}
{"text":"This may be the best place to eat at Terminal One, at least compared to the post-security transborder options. It is definitely far and away the best food I have had at YYZ.  Didn't try the shawarma, I'm sure it probably does suck regularly. YYZ is a terrible place to eat. But the hummus, eggplant and tabbouleh in the mezza plate were all not just good but delicious. And the za'atar mannakesh was also very good. Though the mezza plate came with a freshly fired pita (which was crunchy on the bottom and floury/pale on top, but perfectly serviceable) so perhaps not needed.  Cashier said everything is prepped in the kitchen onsite, downstairs, but by the Paramount chef. So guess that takes some of those food service conglomerate employees who destroy the other food out of the equation."}
{"text":"Never going back.   The self-ordering in the corner is inefficient to say the least. Do they realize how hard it is to do that without your entire party there? And if my party happens to include 3 kids, it's virtually impossible.   I've been there twice and ordered 12 meals. 6 of the 12 were wrong.  Last time, my fries were cold, my daughter's shawarma was cold, my dad's order came 10 minutes after the rest of us...should I go on?  I didn't even want to go a 2nd time but my kids forced me because of the play area. But there won't be a third. I'll go Lara's Restaurant or Esquire nearby for similar food which is better and is either full service or fast food. None of this in-between stupidity. To"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Fresh pita, amazing hummus, great grilled meats, all so yummy. This place seems to get quite crowded for weekday lunch and the location is odd, but who cares the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had tried the Mississauga location and so brought my husband & cousin here for lunch on NYE. My cousin (from NYC & a big foodie) couldn't stop raving about the place! Fresh huge pitas, amazingly smooth hummus, and delicious grilled meats. We had a flatbread (tomato & onion) which was my least favourite item. We also tried the \"foul\" with is only available on weekends for bunch - a mixture of various beans & spices slow cooked ( the manager explained it to me why I was paying the bill). My only complaint is that when they brought over our mixed meat dish they didn't identify the different items to us so we had no idea what we were eating (and my husband refused to try it since he does not eat beef and didn't want to take a chance since there was some beef & some lamb). Aside from this issue it was great and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Paramount but the location at Heartland has been a constant let down..We ordered Falafel wraps and I specifically say I do not want pickles and when we get the sandwich they are loaded with nothing but pickles and the wrap itself is so dry and absolutely no other veggies..It's like the owner has given them strict instructions not to use vegetables in their sandwiches because it's the same if you order shawarma..Such a let down.."}
{"text":"Go to place for my family and i when we are looking to indulge in middle eastern cuisine. The food is always good, so i would say service and food quality has a standard you wont experience an off day.   LOVE LOVE their hummus and pita, wish they gave more hummus though seems like they just smear it against the wall of the container to make it seem like there is more than there actually is.  Tried their platters, arise, manakeesh and chicken shawarma- all good."}
{"text":"I have been a long-time fan of the original location in Mississauga, and I was NOT disappointed with the Toronto location. It took about 5 minutes to be seated, and my boyfriend and I were given a nice 2-seater on the 2nd level. The decor is beautiful, lots of cool stuff to admire and low-key, subtle architectural features. Intentionally rustic and warm. We went on a Saturday night so the place was busy (not surprising given their track record). The service was incredible - we had 2 servers helping us out and they actually looked happy, like they were enjoying themselves. But the reason why I love Paramount is the FOOD. I am always blown away by the taste and the quality. I have been eating middle eastern food for 20 years, my boyfriend is very particular when it comes to how meat is cooked, and we were both very impressed with our meal. We split the meat platter - the chicken was so moist, the beef was perfectly seasoned, the pita bread was so fluffy and fresh. Paramount is a guaranteed delicious meal and I will continue to eat here often."}
{"text":"Love going to this place!  Always get the hummus and kebabs dish.  Their meats are so tender and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The food is good. We ordered quite a lot. They serve complimentary bread...fresh bread. It was good food! The rice was delish. The beef sausages were nothing special. Our server was amazing! She was so friendly.  This place can get chaotic when busy (esp during Ramadan).  We sat by the doors and people were just coming in and out of these doors. Also I did not appreciate homeless people coming and asking for food and one person asking for donations and patted hard on my back because I refused. They need to put railings. They also need to manage the people who enter and just stand around waiting for a table.  The bread should have some accompaniment like labneh or zatar and olive oil or something."}
{"text":"I just had the worst chicken shawarma sandwich. There was barely any meat, all I could taste was the pita, and it set me back about $7. Will not be returning here again. I guess once you've had a shawarma from Ottawa, nothing else will compare!"}
{"text":"Services was very very quick; I got my food within 5 minutes of ordering. Unfortunately that's where the positives end. I ordered a beef shawarma dinner, and a chicken shawarma hummus plate. The beef was way too salty and tasted kind of sour. The chicken was really dry and tasted a bit sour. The rice had no flavor whatsoever. The hummus tasted like thick tahina, I didn't taste any chickpea at all.  Worst of all, there was a hair fused into the complimentary pita bread. I called over the waitress and told her; she just threw the bread out and got us another one, didn't tell the manager or anything."}
{"text":"Not interested in a restaurant that discriminates against blind people .   http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/05/11/woman-with-guide-dog-refused-service-at-toronto-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"Best Arabic food in North America. If u like humus,falafel,chicken, cheese zatar, beef laham & kabab in Dubai or Abu Dhabi then u will get the same taste here.. Really good food and not at all expensive"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting never eating their again the sauce was just horifying tasted like a rotten dead fish the rice tasted like 9lbs of butter the salad lets not even talk about the salad overall worse than a 1 star and over priced I'm actually scarred at the expirience"}
{"text":"It's a shame that I am giving this a low 3 star rating, because the service was friendly and the food on its own tasted great. However, the shawarma meal as a whole was severely lacking.  I ordered a chicken and beef shawarma for take out. It was slightly pricier than other shawarma places and the portions were okay.  The chicken and beef tasted great and was not oily or greasy. The rice tasted good as well.  The problem was a severe lack of any sauces. When I order shawarma dinners, I'm used to getting a lot of sauce with the dinner. This meal was very dry. There was no sauce on it at all, and they didn't even put dressing in the salad.  All you get is a very tiny amount of white sauce on the side. You also get two giant pieces of pita bread, which is way out of proportion. I would have liked less pita and more rice or meat.  With all that pita bread you would think they would give you a lot of sauce to dip it in, but again, be prepared for a very dry meal or make sure to order some extra sauces.  So, the food tasted great but the lack of sauces was a let down. Plus, the meal is out of proportion with all that pita bread."}
{"text":"Compared to other paramount location like downtown and Mississauga this place is below par.  It's mostly due to the service. The order the food came was the main dishes first. They seemed to have forgotten our appetizers.  The drink order was wrong. The we had to ask for bread.  We had to flag down waiters all the time  just to ask for the items we orders.  The waitress that was supposed to bring the rest of our order took our receipt and never returned so we had to ask another waiter. The manager seemed to be oblivious to what was going on.  He was not taking care of his customers.  The portions of the main courses seemed to be a little smaller than the other locations. My parents had taken some friends out there for dinner and was appalled by the service and the layout of the tables.  Her chair was constantly being pushed by another.  She vowed never to return to that location. Overall I would venture out to another location. It's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I rate 4 stars for food but only 1 star for service at this place. So the overall rating is a 2.5 stars from me.  Let's first talk about the food. I ordered a falafel entree with 6 falafel balls. The portion was very generous I couldn't even finish my meal. The taste is delicious. All my other friends seemed to enjoy their meals a great deal as well. I also ordered baklava for dessert. To be honest, the baklava at paramount is not the best baklava I've had. Baklava is supposed to contain lots of nuts but the baklava I had tonight had barely any nuts in it.  Now let's move on to the service. We were quite unhappy with the host and the waitress tonight. When we walked into the restaurant, we told the host that we wanted to sit on the second floor. Instead of checking the occupancy upstairs he just simply told us that the upstairs was full when we could see that there was a large empty table upstairs. the waitress was not welcoming either. She was very slow and when we paid for our meals with cards she went away during the middle because she was too busy talking to other people.The meals took a long time to prepare. Adding on top of this unexpected poor service, we noticed that the restroom is the worst. There was a sign that said \"no use\" for about an hour... walked This place is Amazingbbit it just are"}
{"text":"This fattoush salad was so pitiful and sad. I paid $8 for the salad and then another $7 for the skewer of chicken. This is what a $15 dollar salad looks like. Sad pile of very little greens (regular sized fork for effect), and 4 little pieces of chicken. The bowl itself is about an inch deep. So really barely any salad in there at all.  I followed them from their Mississauga days and their food was awesome! This don mills location is pretty sad and disappointing.   Normally I would give this don mills location a solid 3 but today it's a sad sad 1. I'm so upset I paid $15 for this crap.  Side note: this was a fattoush salad for take out. I would've hoped they would've had the foresight to put the crunchy pita \"croutons\" on the side.. but alas, total soggy disappointment.  I really hope they read their reviews and make some changes because if they carry on like this, they'll have lost a customer in me for sure."}
{"text":":(  ...oh, I need to add more than that. Where do I begin?  -Pickles taste the chlorine. -6 fries on the side. My mom ordered rice and it filled most of her plate. Go for the rice in terms of quantity, but I didn't taste it. -Kafta was dry, however was doused in oil to make it seem moist? Made the pita it was sitting on soggy. -I didn't get the water I had asked for when I ordered my meal (actually I had asked for waters for the whole table) -- until the end of my meal -- and after I watched it sit on the counter for 10 minutes. It was warm tap water to begin with, though, so I'm not really sure what I was so eager for. Maybe just ANYTHING to wash down the yucky taste in my mouth.   Yeah the fluffy pitas you get are great, but by the time ours meals came, or the hummus we ordered to accompany the pitas, we were almost full.  The restaurant itself is also beautiful, but, I do not recommend. It doesn't seem like the servers want to please, anyways."}
{"text":"Great pitas! Slow service. I'll definitely be going back, but I'll make sure I have an extra long lunch break."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. We ordered falafel sandwich, saj beef and hummus to start. Falafel was okay but not that great. The saj beef has a very strong taste of spice( not in a good way) and the meat was chewy. I really liked the hummus and bread but it is not worth coming back here for.  The waitress who took our order did not bother to write it down and she missed up one of the orders. It was not a big deal tho but i mention this because the same thing happened before with the other paramount location. It seems that they are going \"paperless\"!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Lunch time.  Big line as usual to get a table.  Had Kebbek as appetizer, beef and cheese manakeesh, and Mixed Grill as Main Course. Delicious as always."}
{"text":"Freshly baked pitas at Paramount make all the difference!   I've gone here several times and all the different times it's been consistently good.   Upon walking in you're presented with a large spacious open concept. There are different arrangement of seating to suit your preference. Booths or tables. Place is good for individual diners, couples or families.   light limestone tiles and large murals adore the walls giving the place a nice classy feel. Features an open kitchen, ordering counter/bar and front area with a plethora of middle eastern desserts (baklava anyone? and a lot more).    If you hadn't been here before this is what you do. It's a little different.   1. If you're dining in    -Walk to the back and place your order and then tell them your table number. Each table is marked with a number plackard. Upon leaving tell the cash your table number and they will ring you out.   2. If you're ordering take-out.   -Just order at the back pay and wait for your food.    The last time I dined in and ordered :   Shish Tawouk - Chicken Pita $6.99 Laziza Rasberry drink $3   The chicken breast was most juicy and tender. It came with lettuce, baba ganoush, pickles all wraped in a freshly baked pita.   Laziza Rasberry - a non alcohol beverage in a bottle. a little fizz. makes a nice light sweet drink to go along with food.    What's cool here   they bake their pitas on site, they puff up like balloons. taste is amazing too. :)"}
{"text":"Clean, great service, fresh food. Much better in person than the review pictures I found online."}
{"text":"I can see this place is getting mixed reviews I'm gonna go out and jump on it and say I had a very pleasant experience at this restaurant. I recently dined there for lunch took a little convincing to get my mom on board since middle eastern isn't really her cup of tea but we came out both very pleased. I ordered the chicken shawarma a classic cooked to perfection and very flavorful and my mom ordered the falafel which was also quite enjoyable. Next time I needs my middle eastern fill I'm definitely hitting up paramount again soon!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that you can't give a business a zero star rating because that is what this place is.  I recently dined here during a busy lunch hour. I should have known something was wrong when we were served minutes after sitting. My chicken was served raw. I informed our server. She took the dish away and had the meat grilled. The meat was still raw, but now the rest of my meal was cold. The pita bread the chicken laid on was drenched in grill residue and liquid. It was gross. Once again I informed the server and she apologized. We were under the impression that we were being offered some dessert and tea. We had the tea $1.99 and the dessert $1.99, but to our surprise only the tea was comp. wow what a terrible experience.  Well you won't see me eating here any time soon. The tables are so close together that I had to remove my coat in order to squeeze into my chair and I'm an average size person. Just terrible. From customer service to quality of food. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been there twice so far, and both times went with the mixed shawarma. It was great. And oh the fresh pita is amazing. They have varieties of desserts too which is a must try. Expect to pay $10 for a sandwich and $15 for a platter. The service is also very good."}
{"text":"Great catering job.  We ordered catering from this location for a baby shower we hosted this weekend.  Everything arrived on time, and was hot and delicious.  The portions were very generous, and they included plates, cutlery and napkins.  We had many compliments on the wonderful food from our guests.    The catering co-ordinator Muhammad was very helpful in creating the menu.  He had great suggestions for portions and menu options that would be suitable for a party of 35 people with a mix of kids and adults, and he worked within my budget.  I would definitely recommend Paramount for your next party."}
{"text":"If the service wasn't so bad, this would have been a four star review for the food, which was the only reason we've come again - and that's for takeout only, never again for sit down. But now they even screw up takeout orders - missing shish taouk in a meat combo order, giving fries instead of rice - really basic stuff.   Unfortunately, the quality of the food is starting to decline as well, specifically the meat - chicken is dried out, kifta (ground beef with spices) is made with lower quality ground beef, pita is tough and too doughy.  Add on top of that excessively high pricing and this place is in danger of slipping into utter mediocrity.  Management needs to step in and get this place back on track - Paramount was the only good Middle Eastern restaurant in North York."}
{"text":"We had a huge feast! We opted for the half mixed grill plate that came with hummus & pita. What a great meal! The meat was well seasoned and don't get me started on the falafel! We had plenty of leftovers which our server happily packed up for us. All in all a delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. Chicken shawarma wrap was okay, mostly just tasted the pickles. Tabouli just tasted like a bowl of wet parsley, no flavour aside from plain parsley and water. Too bad."}
{"text":"I've been twice now for lunch and really like it.  We always have their special house cold beverage which is a fruity meal in itself.  We also split their excellent pita hummus and chicken appetizer. This is actually enough for lunch but we also have enjoyed their chicken wraps and dessert.  We like both their outdoor patio and indoor tables.  You must order your food and pay at the counter but then they bring the food to your table .  Not licensed."}
{"text":"Went to the new downtown location: food and service were TERRIBLE. Took forever, the food was cold and dry, and some customers got no attention at all while others did. Never again."}
{"text":"Having been to other locations, I wanted to check out the semi-new location in Yorkville.  The service was horrendous!  I ordered a chicken shwarma wrap and it took over 45 mins to arrive, while my friend's order arrived within 15 mins. It was lunch time but the timing was too long for a sandwich.   I had asked my waitress to inquire about my order several times with the same response that the staff was making it.  Thankfully the wrap was tasty, as the chicken wasn't dry with lots of sauce.   The food was pretty standard to other Paramount restaurants but the long lunch wait was not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food is a hit or miss, so I'm giving it a 3-star rating.  Atmosphere: It's huge with a casual cafeteria style look for the interior. Great for large parties.  Service: For the last 4 x I was here, the servers were slow to bring our waters, hot sauce etc.  Customers order and pay at the counter.  Food: The appetizers are amazing from the hummus, Moutabbal (Grilled eggplant with tahini sauce), manakeesh (Middle-Eastern pizza), and huge house-made pitas. There are tons of desserts worth getting.   The mains however are just ok. I've had really dry chicken shwarma dinner in the past, but enjoyed the beef shwarma plate.  I enjoy the selection on the menu but wish the mains were more consistent."}
{"text":"My friend and I each ordered a shawarma chicken plate with fries and the food was so dry. I think they just reheated the chicken because it was so dry and tasteless, and the fries were the same. The salad didn't look fresh either. We went there around 12 and it was packed, there is very little space between the tables and you have to speak really loudly to be heard and it was hard to get server's attention even for a glass of water. And then at the end they give us one bill even though we asked for separate ones, and instead of fixing it the server was just like \"pay each other later\", so there was the awkward I owe you for a lunch. We were both disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location but first time at the Yorkdale location. We were group of 3 and on Thursday evening there were plenty of seatings available. We ordered mixed grill platter and eggplant dip and beef saj wrap and salad with lamb. Food tasted same. Enjoyable to non-middle eastern people.  But the service wasn't just there. While the staff was \"nice\" , I had to ask for our dip (not food, just dip) after waiting around 20 min after we ordered. The place was practically empty (only two other tables occupied) so we weren't very impressed. And then the mixed grill platter came with wrong side. Overall of course I've had worse experience at other places but it could have been better."}
{"text":"Everything came out very quickly and cost very little and the staff were pleasant enough, although I had to ask for sugar and a spoon for my cappuccino and hunt her down for the bill. But the food was mostly bread and everything that wasn't bread was bland or awful. And I like my bland, awful food healthy and my calorific food tasty, thank you very much. Rereading this review, it could really be two stars. But I just can't bring myself to the second star. Just yech."}
{"text":"I love it at Paramount.   I love the pita puff that you get at the beginning. I really like the grape leaves and the hummus (so tahini-y!). And depending on how much you order, I like taking home the leftover hummus or grape leaves for a snack later on.   I like all the things from the grill -- kofta, the skewers and shish tawouk. I also like the shwarma a lot. All the plates have pickles and lettuce and tomato and rice or fries. It is fun and tasty to get all the different sauces and mix and match all the flavours on your plate.   Baklava is one of my favourite desserts of all time. Nuts and honey and flakey pastry. Yessssss. I love how it comes in little bite-sized pieces, and they are all different shapes and sizes.   The atmosphere is casual, which I actually really like, but sometimes it means the service is inattentive. I took off one star because on a couple occasions it has made for a frustrating experience, even though the food is always delicious!  Next step: come with a group and get a family platter."}
{"text":"Conveniently located across the Eaton Centre and steps away from Yonge-Dundas Square, Paramount is definitely a good place to go for Middle Eastern cuisine.  I love their free puffy warm pita bread  which taste good on its own, but definitely order their hummus as they do have one of the best hummus in the city.  Food is always consistent and delicious. Prices are very reasonable and portions are good size.  You definitely won't leave hungry, probably because of all the free pita bread as well.  Service is always very friendly, fast and efficient. The way the servers move in between the close tables as if they're dancing definitely is interesting to watch, whereas customers are struggling to not bump into tables and diners.  Upstairs seating is definitely a little more spacious and not as noisy as downstairs.  Always a good sign when a restaurant is busy and it's definitely not a tourist trap as most are regulars."}
{"text":"The quality at this location is good, and the staff are friendly and efficient. It's been a while since I visited but I think I had the grilled lamb and it was divine. Extremely juicy and flavourful. They didn't mind that our reservation numbers didn't match the number that showed up. They didn't mind as we sat there and chatted for a while before ordering, even though the lineup was growing. I would usually have more to say but I think that's about it. Oh yeah. Eat the pitas when they arrive, not at the end of your meal when they become like cardboard."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but I just could not give this place the 3 or 4 stars that I really wanted to because of 2 things. First, the food took 25 minutes to come out after asking the server twice to check on our order. Second, when the food finally came, it was room temperature except for the falafel which was hot. This was after the server explained that it was made from scratch.   We are reasonable people and even tried to rationalize that maybe the delay was because we ordered a platter. No. As a customer you should be reasonably assured that your food will be hot.   This place has many positives otherwise. There is a play structure for kids, the atmosphere is bright, airy and classy with a middle eastern flair. The food is tasty and attractively plated. There is free arabica coffee spiced with cumin. Washrooms have change tables for babies. You don't have to tip. The list goes on.   Unfortunately, slow room temp food was enough for me to knock this down. I'll stick to the Toronto location for now."}
{"text":"Not up to the same standards of the other paramounts. They need more people working there. Portions are smaller than the other ones. They'd run out of one of their main wrap options and had to wait for them to cook the chicken on the grill because it didn't look as cooked on the spit."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The fresh puffy bread that greets you when you sit down is amazing. Ask for their garlic sauce, ive never had anything like it before. Make sure you're not on a date though, that garlic sure packs a punch and stays with you.  Everything we ordered was fantastic - lamb and BBQ meats and their cheese and sausage \"pizza\".  Even when they gave me the wrong wrap, they replaced it promptly. Lunch is a little bit crowded but turnover is pretty quick.  I'd come back here!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes in the lineup with two kids after being told that the waiting time was only 10 minutes. After we were seated, it took further 20 minutes for someone to show up to the the order only after I asked whether someone will ever take the order. Another 45 minutes wait ensued after we ordered. The food quality was average. Service was a mess with no one knowing what they are doing. We had to ask multiple times for water.   This was probably one of the worst dining experience we have had in a long time. There is nothing fine about this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I had a good meal at Paramount Brampton and was looking forward to sharing the same with a group of Toronto friends.  No comparison!  I ordered the Fatoush salad and like previous comments it was overpriced for what I got, too much dressing and not authentic and literally 6 small pita bits added.  My beef kabob on top had to be cut into tiny pieces to make it chewable and the whole thing was overpriced.  There were 8 of us and the dinners arrived in series so that some of us could wait and could  eat cold food, or we could eat while the others waited.  The server was pleasant, but couldn't keep the orders straight and totally confused the bills, the kitchen was slow and disorganized and the food was less than mediocre.  Only the bill was over the top!  Definitely not up to PARAMOUNT standards!.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Next to Fadi's of Houston,  this place serves great food.     We ordered Hummus, Moutball, and mixed grill (chicken, beef, and lamb)  The order came with 4 huge freshly made bread.   It was a delectable experience as you rip the bread and scoop out the hummus and gently place it in your mouth.    I did this alternating with the eggplant dip for about 10 mins before i touched my mixed grill.     Then i started on the grill,   Everything was cooked spot on.  Tender, juicy, and flavorful.  Definitely recommend this place if you want to take a break from all the greasy food out there."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast and dinner and both times the food was great. Service was quick and staff are very friendly. Very nice atmosphere inside the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"They charge you $0.50 extra for a third sauce. I asked for one line of hot sauce and that was extra! What a rip off!!! They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus. I wish they had an appetizer plate with hummus, grape leaves, and tabouli. If they had this I would give 5 stars.  The staff was great.  I left my phone, they recognized me and brought it right over when I came back for it.  I would go again just for the hummus."}
{"text":"Very bad service ..... They don't know how to deliver food on table.   They ask for tip upfront at the time of order and after that they forget how to provide service."}
{"text":"A fantastically flavourful meal, amazing mezze plate and The Paramount Special beverage was out of this world. A basket of piping hot and puffy pita straight from the kitchen was delivered within minutes of being seated.  The service was great and Susan, the floor manager, not only seated us but took the time to go through and explain the menu and the way the restaurant operates since it was our first time there.  Will definitely  be going back and recommending it to all my friends.  Middle Eastern fare in a lovely restaurant with great service, good atmosphere and comfortable seating. It was off the chain."}
{"text":"I've been to many Paramount locations within their chain and none are as well run and has better food than this location. Everything is always fresh and they are not stingy with the pita bread. Eating in or taking out makes no difference. It's always good."}
{"text":"I've been a couple or three times, always having the chicken/beef shwarma. It's my first foray into middle eastern food. I have nothing to compare it to but I've enjoyed it. It always seems quite busy. I will go back and perhaps even try another dish."}
{"text":"Living in Dubai, Mankeesh is a staple for those who want something good, filling but cheap. So when I found that Paramount offered it in Toronto, I was overjoyed. The portion looked good,  it was made fresh in front of me, and I only payed between $3-$4 for a Zaatar Mankeesh. I had heard great reviews from relatives so i had high expectations. I took it somewhere else to enjoy, a mere 20 min walk, and by the time I got there, the actual bread was hard as cardboard. And when that's hard, there's nothing left to enjoy. The zaatar couldn't make up for it and was just creating a bigger mess as I tried to chew and break off pieces. I tried microwaving it but it would be back to its original hard state in 2 mins. Won't be back. If a restaurant can't serve the easy cheaper foods well, there's probably no hope for the rest. Doesn't live to the hype at all."}
{"text":"Visited this place as it was recommended by a friend who frequents the store in Mississauga.   I am a fan of the type of food so I was more than willing to give it a go.  The service was alright but it felt like we were treated differently as were weren't the regular demographic.   They brought out a couple puffed pitas which was a nice touch. The Hummes to go with it was OK.  I ordered a shawarma plate but instead of rice I asked for fattoush salad. When it came out it was a plate half fattoush and half chicken with half a pita under it all. There was some hummus and garlic sauce on the side. Even though on the menu it says it comes with pickled veggies as one would expect, it didn't. I asked if I could get it added after I received my plate and it was a bit of a hassle as they apparently don't come with the plate if I add salad?  I thought it was a bit strange.   Anyways. I got the veggies, threw them on top and went to town. The fattoush salad was fairly bland but the rest was quite good.  I won't be returning.   Service - 2.5/5 Food - 3.5/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Value - 2/5  Overall - 3/5"}
{"text":"Not as a pleasant experience as the Mississauga location, but a great option for downtown eating. Wasn't as quick as I hoped (for dine-in), but the food was on par with the bar so highly set by the other locations. It looks like there are a few extra additions to the menu for downtown pallets (beef brisket sandwich), not something I was expecting to see on the menu, but it makes sense.   The falafel and shish tawouk are my two favorites - a sandwich being enough for a regular meal, and the platter if you're ravenously hungry."}
{"text":"I wouldve gave it a zero star but there is none..I went there today with my buddy and ordered a shawarma plate mixed and it came after 10 mins. The meat was very dry seems like they had it ready and just re-heated it, it was nasty as hell...I had to drink two cups of water during the entire eating period and couldnt finish all the plate...in conclusion the food was not fresh at all, I couldve done a better shawerma at home. Would not recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in here. We have always just ordered for take-out, I would say 4 times in the last year? Don't ask why it took me so long to realize we shouldn't order from here ever again, but it took 4 tries before I cut them off. The first time was great, they had just opened, the service was good and the food reasonable. However, the service and food declined with each experience it seems. The service is terrible. Not efficient, and definitely disorganized. This last time I was told to sit until my order was ready, yet once it was they had placed it somewhere else and 15 minutes later I was brought the order...Normally if the food is alright I will forget about all else, but the food was really awful. Chicken that is tasteless and chewy and \"cartilage\", mushy salty rice and Kebbeh that is drenched in oil that when you pick it up oil just drips from it is NOT appetizing. Needless to say I won't be ordering from here anymore and will spend less money ordering from the Shawarma place down the street."}
{"text":"I always get Shish Tawook sandwich here...  Cheap, good quality and quantity.  Their platter menu is pretty good and I love their kibbeh!"}
{"text":"I usually order the Kafta plate with half rice and fries. I akwaysssssssssss order the hot sauce! It's my favourite part of my meal.  Service here is ok, some staff can learn a thing or two... Michael the manger SUCKS.  Ask for Amir, he is a great waiter. Always pleasant and professional"}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband stopped by to bring me supper. Well let me tell u it was the worst chicken and beef swarm I have ever eaten. The chicken and beef  you couldn't bit into it ,it was cold  tough and the fries just as cold. The prices out rageous.  Will not be going to this Paramount again  if I wasn't in hospital it would of demanded another be made and not one left from someone who didn't show up. Not a good impression was made."}
{"text":"Totally in love with their food. Fresh, authentic, many choices, reasonably priced.  Try their Cheese Zattar, grape leaves, hummus, fresh Kubus bread.  Also, the \"Paramount Special\" drink is to die for."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tabbuleh salad very much. The waiter was kind and helpful. I liked the decorations of the place. The only thing I didn't enjoy was music, but it wasn't too loud, so not a big deal."}
{"text":"I ain't going there again. The food was good. Not great. But I don't have much qualms about it. But what really bothered me was the service. We went in a group of 6 where half of us were vegetarians. We asked for the Lentil Soup (which is displayed right on their menu screen) and they started laughing saying \"no, who drinks soup in the summer? \". Hello then why is it on your menu and who are you to judge? Then one of my friends asked for the Shish Tawook (again on their menu) they said no we don't have. Asked for the Marakesh (was not on the menu but is usually available in other Paramount locations). Again a no Then finally just reverted to good old shwarma wraps and bowls. I think this itself started on a wrong note that everything felt disorganized. And they continued to look at us funnily since we asked stuff which they didn't have. This is not how you treat your customers. If you don't have something that's fine but don't make us feel bad for asking. Be humble and just openly say \"sorry we just don't carry it anymore or during the  summer\". I would respect you more for that honesty. I think what is going well for them is the location which is what drives in the large lineups and customer base. But if this attitude continues people will eventually stop coming."}
{"text":"I don't normally go out of my way to write a review but tonight we had a truly terrible experience. Service was abysmal and the food was extremely mediocre.  In the half-empty dining hall, we sat for about 5 minutes without any acknowledgement from the FOH staff. We all ordered variations on the same thing (three falafel wraps) and our food took about 45 minutes to come. It was particularly frustrating when our food came, since one of the orders came up wrong - not once, but twice. One of my companions is a vegetarian and the first wrap was definitely chicken. The second wrap that came was thankfully falafel, but the condiments were wrong. My food strangely came at a much later time despite the fact that we had all ordered the same thing. The wrap condiments were quite salty and the falafel was dry. To top it all off, there were parties that arrived after us and were served before us.  We were also rushed because we had another engagement; unfortunately an hour and a half was not enough time to place an order for three wraps.   Steer clear or head to another location. This establishment is not worth your time or consideration."}
{"text":"If I have craving for hummus or kebab, I always choose this place and they never let me down for four years. Hummus is so creamy unlike store bought packages...  So far we tried Kafta, Falafel, and mixed grill and all tasted amazing. And these portion are huge because it usually comes with pita bread. So, it is pretty filling for everyone. Awesome.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away. After finding out the shwarma dinners came with sliced lettuce, not a salad (this seems ridiculous and was disappointing), I went for a salad with shwarma on it instead. It was tasty, but expensive considering what you get. I wasn't impressed. I might come back again one day, but nothing about the experience was overly memorable. It was kind of disappointing given how excited I was for this place to open."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many many times and it has  been consistenly awesome. I recommend the mixed  BBQ platter, pizzas.and of course order a basket of  their FREE  home made bread  because is the bomb Ask the server to bring you the spicy sauce and the garlic sauce, mix both of them together and dip your steamy hot bread in it.... heaven in your mouth. I think the  upstairs is nicer than the main levell and it's also less crowded. The menu is very reasonably priced. Overall a decent spot  to eat after a long day of shopping =)"}
{"text":"Never liked Paramounts service. Waiters are moody, sometimes nice and sometimes very rude and will ignore you aswell."}
{"text":"the chicken shawarma was dried out and tasted like it may be from the day before. the kofta was very dry as well...very disappointed, the best part was the pizza I ordered for my daughter...won't be eating here again. $40.00 wasted... next time showtime bistro for me!"}
{"text":"I went there last night.  The food was tasty but the portions were ridiculously small.  I ordered the Shish Tawouk main plate with rice ($15.99).  When the plate arrived all I could see was  a massive mound of rice.  It was supposed to be 2 skewers of chicken but there were only ~ 6 cubes of chicken. The vegetable serving was laughable and looked more like a garnish than a serving. Bottom line is I will not go back to that location."}
{"text":"It's a Paramount and it's in Scarborough what's not too love. Great options as always with excellent service. Not a fan of the plaza though."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this particular Paramount location. My good friend brought me to this restaurant back in May. Since my first time at this place, I had been hooked on the food at Paramount since.  I went again to the restaurant just last month as well. Love the food portion offered!  I love their grape leaf dish. So yummy! I had tried their chicken and beef dish twice.  I even tried their juice and it's delicious as well.   I always leave Paramount restaurant satisfied and content. The food prices are acceptable for people on a budget."}
{"text":"Wow. Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  Takes forever - we ordered chicken shawarma to go and literally took 30 minutes. Bad customer service - one of the cook wanted to fight one of my buddies after we have waited 25 minutes Worst shawarma I've ever had. The customer service was rude  Avoid this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Great option for quick service food! The chicken shawarma is my favorite along with the cheese pizza.   The garlic sauce is the best I have ever had! I eat here almost every week."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious and you can view a lot of the food from the side counters. They also have an upstairs but I think they try to fill up the bottom floor before sending anyone up to the top which was a shame cause I wanted to sit upstairs.  When you first sit down, you get this basket of pita set down. It's definitely fresh out of the oven because it was still warm when we got it and you could even see the steam. Not to worry, you won't get charged for it at the end of your meal. We had a bit of difficultly figuring out how to eat it, whether to eat it plain or not so we asked the waiter and he told us it goes nicely with the hummus, which we ordered to try.  He was right - it was delicious!  'm always craving for shawarma so I ordered the beef shawarma. It fell a little short of my expectations; I've definitely had better shawarmas elsewhere. The beef was a bit too dry for me so there definitely could have been more sauce. I would definitely skip the shawarma but I've heard that the middle eastern version of pizza called Manakesh was one of their best offerings.  I'll have to try that next time!  The hummus alone is worth trying out Paramount, and the price is great! It's easy to get dishes and share among friends. The service was good but a little over the top. We had 3 or 4 different servers asking us the same thing over and over again. Some might consider that being attentive but when you are trying to catch up with friends, it's hard to hold a conversation when you keep being interrupted."}
{"text":"We were planning to go here for dinner, for some time now and finally went there on Friday for dinner. The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait for our table.   Ambience: (3/5) The place has a really good interior. But the seating and tables were so crowded and very close by. Our table for two was so small that we couldn't fit all our dishes.   Service: (5/5) Service was very quick and the staff were friendly. The waiter who came with our food saw our full table and immediately arranged to join the adjacent empty table to ours, just to give us more space for our plates (forgot to get his name)! I was surprised that even when the place was so crowded, they joined the tables, instead of seating two people there. Felt nice about that!!  Food: (5/5) Food was super good. Being a vegetarian didn't have many options but we thoroughly enjoyed our order. We had Mezza plate with falafel. We had it with pita bread. The bread was warm and fresh. Hummus, Moutabbal and tabbouleh were super good!! Then we had Lentil soup, served with fried pita chips (soup was okay). Finally, cheese saj and zaatar with cheese manakeesh. Their portions were pretty generous, we couldn't finish it all. We were so full by the end.   Do check out this place for some delicious middle eastern food. Must try their hummus and tabbouleh. We will definitely come back for their pita and dips!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, awesome food & nice space!  The good: The food is excellent. So far I've had the falafel sandwich, but it was tasty, with stuffed grape leaves and kibbeh. The kibbeh was by far the stand-out appetizer and I'll be ordering it again.  The bad: Not really anything - the place tends to be very busy from what I've heard. Tables are really small and the plates are big and the baskets of complimentary pitas are even bigger. Was a bit noisy.  Wouldn't recommend it as a date place, but definitely for friendly outings."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had lunch but was still to full to have dinner what a great value. A meal for a king. Service was top  10/10 best bang for your buck..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in GTA. They have play area for kids so you can kill 2 birds with one stone. Kids enjoy playing and eating here as well as you can watch them while having your meal! I would not recommend shawarma but all the rest of food is great and healthy!"}
{"text":"Came for take out and was expecting the worst, as I've been here before for take-out and have waited for anyone to even acknowledge my order.  It's not new news that this place struggles with customer service at times, so if you come in with that understanding, your visit will be a lot more bearable.   Got the lamb 'sandwich' (which is actually a wrap) and a manakeesh (cheese & zaatar, my fav). Lamb was quite sinewy and chewy, which was disappointing since the last time I got it it was great. Loved my manakeesh, particularly because I stopped by for a snack one day for one and they said they ran out of zaatar. Not sure how this happens...it's like saying you ran out of salt & pepper... but they lost a customer that day. I recommend trying it if you're unfamiliar with zaatar, its quite tasty and if you don't like it, it's only $4 and you tried something new.  My friend got the shish tawouk plate and he seemed satisfied with it.   I do admire how efficient they TRY to be; they have their meat skewers ready to go in front of their grill, dips packaged up, and smoothies displayed enticingly. Atmosphere is always humming and bustling so if you like that energy definitely stay for a seated meal. If not, or are in a hurry, beware of slow, slow take out.  p.s. I remember coming here for dinner last year and suddenly arabic music was blasting from all corners and you got the urge to bust out some belly dancing moves. Apparently it was someone's birthday upstairs, so be prepared if you come for a birthday!"}
{"text":"Paramount is one of the more authentic purveyors of Gulf States style Middle Eastern food; essentially; this place is just like going to a large family restaurant in Dubai! Especially on Friday night, because as in Dubai the place is packed with Saudis on their way to party.  This is the full service version of this four location local chain and that is a term which I use very loosely.  The servers are pleasant enough and seem to want to meet the needs of their customers - but the operational landmines in this establishment are not about to allow ANY quality customer service to sneak past.    Candidly - this is the worst of the Paramount establishments.  The one in Mississauga is superb and the one in Thornhill is rated the best by my friends who call this type of food \"home cooking\".  Still, for the quality of the baked goods alone it represents a welcome addition to the downtown culinary scene."}
{"text":"Fine food? Really? I think NOT! Gave it 1 star based on the atmosphere but don't let the decor fool you. As it may look clean and new, the food here is definitely not fine. We ordered the chicken and beef. Both were served cold, in dry pitas with barely 2oz of chicken in one and maybe 3oz in the beef. What a ripoff! Never again. Terrible first impression on a grand opening. Save your money and take your appetite down the street to Liberty Schawarma."}
{"text":"Bad service. Cold meals. Prices high. I dont recommend this resturant, this is my first and last trial here."}
{"text":"Ordered in from Paramount recently, and I was quite impressed! It's always a mission to find food that will stand the test of delivery time and give you great leftovers. Paramount held up quite nicely, and I appreciate that.  I got a chicken shwarma plate, which was very well packaged and tasty. However, when I want this type of food... I really want the sauces! ALL the sauces. The plate came with garlic sauce on the side (rare to find in Toronto), but I needed more! I also ordered the Mezze Plate and it came with hummus, moutabbal, and tabouleh. Such a gorgeous plate! The hummus was slicked with olive oil, paprika and a few tray whole chickpeas. The tabbouleh was super fresh with large pieces of chopped parsley. Also amazing was the moutabbal, which brings baba ganoush to mind. This was also cutely decorated with a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. Yum! Don't miss adding this appetizer to anything you order from here! You can never have too many dips!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Paramount Fine Foods Cuisine: Middle Eastern Location: Downtown Toronto Address: 253 Yonge St Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 1 Ambiance: 1 Overall: 2  Paramount Fine Foods is in heart of Dundas Square. I've passed by this place so many times and it was busy all the time so I decided to check it out. There are seats by the front that's like outside seating. If you like people staring at you while you eat, there is always that option. They serve Appetizers, Sandwiches and Meat Plates.  There were so many different types of dessert but I had no idea what they were. If you didn't catch on yet, I am a newbie with Middle Eastern Food.  They have this Take-Out display window when you first walk into the restaurant that totally caught me off guard. I wasn't sure if we had to wait for someone to seat us or we just had to line up and get our food and sit down like a foodcourt.  Ordered: HUMMUS ($4.99) The Complimentary bread went very well with the Hummus, the hummus comes in this to-go plastic bowl so I am assuming it's easier for people to take home when you don't finish it. Which is most likely the case cause it was huge! The hummus itself had very mild flavor and wasn't too garlicky with a drizzle of olive oil on top.  Ordered: CHICKEN SHAWARMA ($10.99) This is a really big dish. It come with a giant bread on the bottom topped with grilled chicken pieces, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and this yogurt sauce. You are suppose to rip the bread into small pieces and wrap some of the rice and chicken and eat it. This was like the Beef Shawarma Sandwich but opened up. I thought it was just ok, nothing special. Chicken pieces didn't have much flavor and the pickle/tomato pieces were warm..don't know if it was suppose to be like that?  Ordered: BEEF SHAWARMA SANDWICH ($5.99) This is all the beef, lettuce, pickles and white yogurt sauce wrapped in a bread. For the price, it's a decent size and had lots of beef in it. To be honest I think it could have more seasoning (no idea what though) cause it was too bland for me.  So I feel like I can't really tell if it's good/bad Middle Eastern food because I haven't had it very often and don't know much about it. But personally, I didn't really enjoy anything from this restaurant. Maybe I am too used to Beef/Chicken Shawarma I usually pick up from small vendors that are heavily seasoned and sauced. But hey, that's what I enjoy.  Even if I really enjoyed the food, their service completely turned me off from ever visiting this restaurant in the future. Yes, it is a very busy restaurant- but mid way through my meal, I ordered a diet coke. It never comes so I ask again (different person), wait 10 more minute? nothing!! In total I think I asked about 4 times for a damn can of Diet coke and they couldn't deliver. By the time we got our bill, one of them finally tried to give us the stupid diet coke which I didn't even want anymore. AND they gave us the wrong bill which was like $60 when our original bill was $25'ish.  Summary: This is not a place to enjoy a relaxing meal, the tables are crowded and the service is slow. The atmosphere and the service is not worth the tip you have to squeeze out at the end of the meal. If you crave shawarma, I recommend you go to some smaller joint around the corner and it will taste exactly the same (maybe even better)"}
{"text":"Food: I had the mezza plate as an appetizer that we shared. I love hummus and the two hummus dips were great! Had a lot of flavour without going overboard. The olive oil drizzled on top completed it for me. The chicken shawarma saj wrap was good! Could've been a bit more savory as it tasted a bit dry. Wouldn't order it again but it was decent.   Ambience: the customer service was good! And the interior looked modern and pleasing as well  Overall rating: 3.5/5   Would love to come back for that mezza plate!"}
{"text":"Well my first visit here and I can say that I am very impressed with the level of service and how clean the restaurant is. I can say if you want some interesting eggs for $4.99 come on in :). I had tha kafta on rice very nice."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. It was the best. Filled with families every day. You had to wait to get a table. I havent stopped by in a few months. Last night went there, and it was pretty dead. I noticed they renovated and changed their menus.   The prices have went up too. The meals were under $10 at one point now its around $13 for a plate. The beef wasn't even beef. It was mostly fat. The hummus was runny.  I was wondering why such a drastic change in food quality, then noticed the staff have changed. The place has been sold and is no longer owned by an Arabic owner.   I used to love this place, but it has turned into a chain. WIll not go back again. Pyramids on Eglinton and Mavis is a much better choice with lower prices too."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Highly recommend! One of the best place for middle eastern food downtown.  My favorite thing is their complimentary bread.  I've had better kebob elsewhere but for the atmosphere, the bread and the variety of food in additional to great service, this is the place to be.  You can't leave without trying their dessert!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because a friend mentioned they had a play place inside. My toddlers absolutely loved it and my husband an I were able to enjoy dinner while the kiddos ran around. The food tasted good and their Paramount special drink was pricy but excellent. I would strongly recommend this to someone with small kids that wants to be able to go out for dinner somewhere the kids will love that is not McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by an early Saturday evening meal here. I admit the service was a bit slow at times, but the staff were incredibly pleasant and accommodating.  The Mezza plate of hummus, tabbouleh, and moutabbal (smoked eggplant dish) was an excellent and delicious accompaniment to the complimentary hot, fresh pita bread.  My lamb wrap was fantastic. The grilled lamb pieces were super tasty.  Would forego the fries altogether next time: They were luke-warm, unseasoned, and lacking requisite crispness.  Seems like a good choice for a relaxed meal but less so for a hurried lunch."}
{"text":"Paramount at Yonge and Dundas square was one of my favourite spots in Toronto for middle eastern food; however, it seems that the business model has changed since I used to go (case and point is that there is now almost a dozen locations in Toronto, including in food courts in the core). While the food is still good (7/10) the great service of the original location didn't make the transition to Yorkville."}
{"text":"I took a chance on this kiosk pre-security at Terminal 1 in the Toronto International Airport.  Well, way, way, waaaaay overpriced and the food is not great at all.  Mostly, service and food delivery are extremely slow! There were 7 people working and my order took 40 Minutes with only 2 orders before me!!!  The food is visually appealing but there is nothing \"fine\" about it and the taste is inconsistent from one prepackaged dish to an undercooked meat; yet you still wait forever!!! What was the airport thinking, Putting  such a crappy shop in the food court? The food is not even authentic medditeranean and most of it is pre-made and pre-packaged!!!!!!!!  I ordered the baba ganouche which was prepackaged; it had way more tartar sauce than eggplant purée and it tasted gross.  The three cheese flat bread was actually a thick crust pizza with cheese shavings, the dough to cheese ratio was unacceptably ridiculous!  It was dough 1 cheese 0 on the scoreboard of the fantasy flatbread pool!!!  The chicken skewer side was ok BUT two Chunks  were undercooked, so no! No! No! Big time nooooo!!!!! The only saving grace of this meal was the prepackaged fatouche salad which had a nice pre-packaged citrus vinaigrette, big effing deal!  I can grab a salad anywhere else so not much to compliment on.   They had a bottled yogurt drink bottle in the fridge which I tried and it was good.  Together with a bottle of diet coke, it was a horrible, horrible meal And a waste of $34!!!! $34 for crap! Stay away! Slow! #foodNotGood! #overpriced #neverAgain"}
{"text":"If you want to eat real food as has been the case for thousands of years with humans then go to this place. People who have lived in NA all their lives have a lot to be proud of but they have pretty much eaten garbage all their life and don't know any better. Go to see how food looks like before going in the processing tubes and slowly killing you... For Canada, amazing ME place.  People who drink concentrated OJ might not appreciate this one....go to the arches.... Enjoy"}
{"text":"The flavours of the food are good but the service went downhill since this place opened. Cashing out takes forever. If you get your order to go, even if it's not busy, make sure you follow up with someone about your order status. Otherwise they let the food sit somewhere out of sight. Kinda ridiculous."}
{"text":"A clean, cosy place with real mid eastern atmosphere. The servers are always smiling and helpful. The food is great tasty, healthy and well prepared. Wait time is reasonable. They have a play area which my daughter loves so much"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to some Mediterranean food when we came across this restaurant in Yelp. The reviews seemed pretty good and we decided to give it a try. It was very close to our hotel which was a bonus.   It was a strange experience once we got in because it looked like we had to wait to be seated and there were a few waiters walking in front of the counter, but no one seemed to be interested in seating us. That was all well though, because you have to order at the counter anyways, so that was the logical first step. After we placed our orders and took our seats, they brought in their pita bread with hummus. Man, those pitas were huge! And delicious! I had to take care not to fill myself up on the bread before our sandwiches came but it was certainly difficult to stop eating.  Later, our sandwiches came... but at different times. I get very bummed out when food doesn't come at the same time at a non-fast food place. My husband had to wait about five minutes before his sandwich came.  My husband ordered the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (always a favorite among us) and I went for the Shish Tawouk Sandwich. Both the sandwiches were delicious, especially the Shish Tawouk one. The chicken shawarma was quite different from the ones we've had in other places - it also wasn't juicy or moist enough. That apart, it was good. The Shish Tawouk sandwich was certainly the winner. The chicken tasted great and the sandwich itself was quite moist.  A meal at a Mediterranean restaurant cannot end without having some of the baklava. We took some pistachio, some chocolate, and some cashew nut baklavas. All the baklavas were way too dry - We didn't like the pistachio ones at all. But the chocolate ones were tasty. The cashew nut baklavas were okay.  Service-wise, I don't know if it was just our luck, but when we wanted to place our order, or buy some baklavas, or pay the bill, there was no one around to help us. This is certainly not a traditional restaurant - the waiter service is patchy and nobody refilled our water glasses.  Overall, a mixed experience. Definitely a good lunch place and great food. I would have given 4 stars for the food but coupled with the poor service, I'll have to say it's a 3."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I came here last night after a show at Massey Hall. The food was wonderful - warm, delicious zaatar bread, fresh hummus, perfectly crunchy falafel, great schwarma. At 10:45 pm this place was still buzzing, but we still got seated and served quickly. The atmosphere is warm and friendly and the price was right. As far as authentic middle eastern food in Toronto goes, Paramount is extremely authentic. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service kinda slow. Been here 3 times. Waitresses pleasant. Kinda pricey but it is the shops at Don Millsfresh pita from oven, fresh fruit smoothies, taboulé I've had better, hummus is good and so is matoubal. Kebabs are yummy too! Will eat there again. My son loves their wood oven pizza"}
{"text":"The conditions of the kitchen in this place was horrible today. A plastic bin on the counter with what looked like ground meat in it, was left near the back door which was left open to a back alley. Flys could have easily found there way in that as the outside garbage bins weren't more than five feet away. I looked in the bin and the mixture was swimming in this nasty liquid. The smell was mortifying! People in the kitchen not wearing hair nets. Wearing street clothes with no apron (two guys /one with apron and one without) welcomed me inside through the kitchen as I am an Uber eats biker and have been riding around the dirty city for hours. They made me, walk through the kitchen because for what I thought they don't want to disturb customers in the front of the restaurant. But how sanitary can that possibly be? And what's dumb is that I had to walk to the front anyway where the food was sitting there waiting for me by the cash register. Why not inform drivers to just go to the front in the first place?   Once the food was in my bag I had to walk to the back and through the kitchen again. I saw one guy scratch his nose and continue rolling some loose mixture into balls with his hands, without washing his hands. The floor was filthy and the tables all covered with open containers of different foods and ground meat like mixtures. Again the back door still open and the smell as I left was terrible. Dirty water in a mop bucket right there next to another open container as I left. I couldn't wait to get out. I could have easily left hair in something, it wouldn't be impossible. I'll never eat here ever! If people get sick it wouldn't surprise me at all."}
{"text":"There food is really good one of the nice Arabic food.  I have tried this place in toronto downtown and in Mississauga.  The food quality in both locations are the same however Mississauga one more quite and nicely organized.  I recommend mix grill plate for a big guy like me or for 2 regular people :)"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly when I visited and the decoration is pretty modern.  However the food is very subpar and disappointing quality considering the prices they charge. $40 for 4 small sandwiches?  Wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"Terrible food, meats were bland... Too chewy and the food was burnt. Do not go! The service also sucks. For a Mediterranean restaurant, they don't even get the rice right. This place is one of the worst places in the city. Such a scam!"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here but my family of 6 and I suffered extreme food poisoning from eating here last weekend. We consulted a doctor and we indeed did all fall sick from eating at Paramount."}
{"text":"I love Middle-Eastern food, and have it very often. Was very excited about this place being close to my work.  Hugely disappointed (even a year later, when I was dragged there for a meeting).    Here's why: Everything tastes super-bland (for the dishes that they are, when compared to other places serving the same dishes).  The place is also chaotic (then again, many downtown places are.  We tried about 10 different dishes here between us, and all were just bla (not necessarily bad, but nothing one would pay for outside a supermarket either).  on the plus side, the pitas, when served, look fancy and smell good (but taste like paper, unfortunately), and the place looks interesting.  But these are not enough for a restaurant to get a good rating on their own.  I seriously don't understand why so many people are in here day in and day out.  Maybe because they think \"oh, it's so full, must be good\"?  dunno.  Oh, and their northern location (north of Yonge and Steeles) is just as bad, albeit less chaotic."}
{"text":"The Kafta is great but the service is terrible. Our waiter took way too long to bring a couple of waters. I guess he was too busy tweeting."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Paramount Fine Foods. It's actually a pretty big chain I've seen them in Canada and also the USA. We decided to get take out for the whole office today. The service was a bit slow, but it was a big lunch order.  I got the beef shawarma with everything in it and fries. For their sides they have lettuce, pickles veggies, garlic sauce, hot sauce, tebullah, onions, and pickles. I also order an additional side of chicken yallal fries. It's basically a shawarma Poutine with their garlic sauce instead of gravy with your choice of shawarma meat (I.e. Beef or chicken). I personally really likes the fries. The shawarma was okay.  A few of my co workers got the open plate shawarma. That seems a little better. It comes with your choice of side fries or rice and they all come with extra pita on the side.  Their garlic sauce is a must ! It is the best I've had ! Get extra on the side for your fries too!"}
{"text":"Paramount is one of my favourite places in Mississauga to grab a shawarma/Middle Eastern eats.  This location has ample seating, it was packed last night on a Monday night.  The ordering process is cafeteria style with waiter service, you go up to the counter and order and they bring the food to your table once it is ready.  Food is always hot and fresh.  I love the fresh pita bread they service when you get a table.  Their hummus is a must try as is their manakeesh counter.  Their zatar bread is soo yummy!  If you love sweets, you will fall in love with their sweet counter which is baklava galore!  Make sure that your stop by Paramount whenever you are in the Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how fast Paramount has grown in the GTA; they had a poster on the front announcing a contest to celebrate their 10 Years!  (http://www.paramountfinefoods.com/10years/)  We came here on Sunday for lunch and we arrived at 11:45 am, and we had no issues getting a table. Restaurant was very clean, from outside you could smell the shawarma roasting on the spit, and once inside, the smell of the bread oven.  The nice thing about weekends is that you can order the dishes they only make Sat-Sun like Foul (bean and chickpea bowl), and lebneh (thick yogurt). The menu also featured new stuff (since my last visit to a sit-down Paramount) like the Saaj bread, grilled wings, and the aptly named 'Yalla' Fries lol.  Anyways, we ordered the moutabal (roasted eggplant dip), and a cheese & zataar(thyme and sesame seed) manakeesh, a fatoush salad with chicken shawarma, and a falafel plate, which all came with a basket of freshly baked bread. The flavors were all authentic, the salad ingredients we're fresh, and the bread is, as-always, amazing. The falafel was also really light and fluffy, and we knew they were fried to order because even after 10 mins, they were still crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. The flavor was also not over-powering, and a good chickpea flour ratio that made it light and pillowy.   Service was also really nice, she very helpful with water refills, hot sauce, and napkin requests. Thank you!   4.5 *"}
{"text":"I've visited this place once, and I feel like that was enough times. The food was fresh and pretty good but the service wasn't that great. I have to say, the decor is very nice, but I feel like that was the best part of my entire dining experience. This place is neither great or terrible, it's just okay. Worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"I think the current aggregate rating of three stars for this restaurant is pretty spot on.   There were some good things and not so good things.   The good:  1. Chicken shawarma was pretty tender and flavourful; 2. Hot sauce was okay, but could have been hotter; 3. The garlic sauce was yummy; 4. The location is convenient and parking was plentiful.  The not-so good:  1. I had to ask for the okay hot sauce three times (I only ended up receiving it was I was just about finished eating; no bueno); 2. The portion of meat was incredibly skimpy. There was probably less meat in our beef/chicken shawarma platter than there would have been in a shawarma wrap in most other places; 3. The beef was kind of dry and not that flavourful or tender. 4. They are very skimpy with the sauces. They give you condiment cups of sauce on the side (one garlic, one tahini) and they were barely half-filled. If you ask for another, good luck waiting around for it like my tardy hot sauce. 5. The falafels were pretty hard and dense."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant but food is still average. Staff are friendly but they need to step up the food - it's basically middle Eastern fast food. I had the mixed grill entree - boring plain rice, beef kabobs were dry and over-cooked (mid Eastern tendency I find).  Pita bread is very fresh but whole wheat pita should be an option. The babaganoush (eggplant dip) and hummus were good. The tabbouli was bland and tasteless.  Room for improvement, over all."}
{"text":"I had wraps from this location for a catered corporate lunch. It was fine, I suppose. I guess they make it purposely bland to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. No hot sauce, no pickled turnips. The meat wasn't very flavourful. The beef was definitely better than the chicken."}
{"text":"Finally a location that is closer to me.   Pros - The food is always very fresh - They are generous with the bread and dipping sauces which I love most - Just found out that they also offer free hot sauce in addition to their famous garlic sauce and hummus - Love the decor - Waiters and waitresses always friendly  - They have a playground for kids which is good for families or events  Cons - The amount of food that they put on the plates seems to get smaller compared to when they just opened - The waiters are very friendly but they keep forgetting to bring cutleries or water. Sometimes we had to ask several waiters until we got them. By the time the food started to get cold. I have been there a few times and this also happens when it's not so busy. Maybe the staff is new, who knows. - during weekends there are long waiting times, so better go during the week"}
{"text":"The food was really good, the staff was nice.  The prices are ok but I think that the \"pizza\" is too small and too expensive. Anyway I would recommend this place, I loved their food."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Paramount since there was only one location, in Mississauga, and I always enjoy the food.  Now that this Yonge/Steeles location is open, it's become my favourite location because it's not as crowded and I find the staff friendliest here.  They don't have full table-service, so you just go up to the order counter, place your order, and give them the table number of where you'll be sitting, and they'll bring you your food.  My favourite thing to get are the manakeesh because they are cheap (~$3) and tasty.  I really like the zaatar or labneh, probably because I don't get to eat that stuff outside of middle eastern restaurants.  I also love the bread that comes to the table with your meal, just be careful breaking it open because the steam is really hot!  Other favs are the hummus, kebabs, and falafels, which I find are done fairly well and always consistent.  Shawarmas are just average, but still good.  The sweets are always so tempting!!  I like how they're small so I don't feel bad for indulging.  I always feel bad for calling someone over to pack me up just a few, but they always do it with a smile."}
{"text":"We loved the food here...pita bread freshly made, great falafel and delicious beef and chicken in the mixed grill. The mango strawberry drink was amazing. Service was friendly and competent. If we lived in Toronto, this would be our go to restaurant for middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here. Basically we stuck with the shawrma sandwiches. Food was good. Outside of Kuwait, I have not had a shawrma sandwich which comes close. But this was just fine. I was surprised that they do not offer pepperoncini with their sandwiches. Not a huge fan of the place but will go here if I want to have a shawrma. I think there are many more such places in the area"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my second home. I moved to Yonge and Shepard a year ago and didn't like going to the further locations for Paramount, so I discovered the don mills location. It's been so good my husband and myself. #1 difference is you don't order at the front desk, they take your order and you pay at the table. There's buttons for you to push to interact with the waiters. The manager, Carl, is phenomenal. He treats you like family, greets you with a warm smile and polite conversation and is always running around making sure he makes every single persons time there more wholesome. I'm here twice a week...enough said lol!"}
{"text":"Ordered on a Monday at 5pm for takeout.  Ordered a chicken shawarma and shish tawouk sandwiches.  I don't know if it was just the day and time, but the portions have shrunk a lot.  There was barely any chicken and just full of garlic sauce and lettuce.  For the price it was a really small portions. Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"A steamy pita A misunderstood server A Sunday tradition  Fun fact: I always come back for more Sad fact: I have already tried every item on the menu. The servers sometimes do not get the idea. Win fact: Steamy pitas, Baba ganoush, fresh pastries, falafel"}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre. The service is slow and after eating a lot of time middle easter food, I think that I'm very disappointed with the quality and the flavor of this dishes. The meat of the shawarma was dry and flavorless and the falafel hasn't all the traditional ingredientes. Just falafel and lettuce. It is overpriced.  it isn't worth it. My best advice is to skip this awful place."}
{"text":"A group of 12 people averaged rating the experience 4 out of five. But must mention the following too:  -Line up to pay -Onion grilled with the skin still on (from no frills to the grills)  -half chicken not fully cooked inside but burnt outside  -too much tahini in the hummus  -beef a bit dry  Other than that the rest was good"}
{"text":"I believe this is the best location from all other Paramount chain and love the fact they have all the sections. This place newly opened in Heartland and is a very big location.  The sections are divided into Juice bar&Desert (sweets), Grill, and Flat bread (pizza) areas.  I love the Manakeesh (Flat bread) area. It is like a thin crust pizza and you can select the topping on it, I love their spicy chicken. It is also good to order with friends as you can order bunch and try them. But this time I went with Beef with Cheese, which includes Ground beef mixed with Mediterranean spices & finely chopped tomatoes topped with melted Accawi cheese. The Beef was really tasty.  I also saw Philly Shawarma Pizza, something new I noticed and ordered it. This bread included Beef Shawarma, peppers and onions, topped with melted mozzarella cheese. Which was quite good but the Beef Shawarma meat was low as a topping.   Its kind of self serve as you will have to go order and give your table number for the food to come on and then pay for it. But the servers bring the food, cleaning the table, at the door were all great, fast and friendly.  The service is fast. Alas I didn't see the free Turkish coffee at this location, which was always at their first location.  For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat!"}
{"text":"They took over 30 minutes to make our food. BBQ beef was over done. Chicken was good."}
{"text":"Just delicious & excellent food, the staff is very friendly and helpful. They are very concerned about customer satisfaction, the manager himself walks around the tables to insure a very high standard service is done to the customers ."}
{"text":"I believe this is the best location from all other Paramount chain and love the fact they have 4 sections.  The sections are divided into Juice bar, Grill, Desert (sweets) and Flat bread (pizza) areas.  I have tried their Sharwara plate and its quite good but not best in the area. The bread they give is very nice puffy and soft. Their juices and shakes are freshly made hence a little pricey but well worth it.   I love the Flat bread area. It like a thin crust pizza and you can select topping on it, I love their spicy chicken. It is also good to order with friends as you can order bunch and try them.  Its kind of self serve as you will have to go order and give your table number for the food to come on and then pay for it.   The service is fast and they also have a patio in the summer. The other free perk is Turkish coffee, well that in if you can handle really strong coffee.  For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat!"}
{"text":"I love the fact they have variety  Juice bar, Grill, Desert (sweets) and Flat bread (pizza) areas.  I love the Flat bread area. It like a thin crust pizza and you can select topping on it, I love their spicy chicken but I also ordered Zatar and spinach with cheese which were decent. It is also good to order with friends as you can order bunch and try them. I had these as take out and they were packed nicely.   For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at this paramount and my last. Service got better but for some reason the food quality is not good especially compared to the Mississauga and Thornhill locations.  Basically they don't know how to wrap a decent sandwich, the takeout/pick up waiting area is... a wall yes a wall!  I think they should train their staff better because quality is definitely decreasing since they opened the downtown location."}
{"text":"I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously I looked here and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't ordered any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and I was hungry so I didn't say anything and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want and unless this is the McDonald's of middle eastern food that is just weird. Service was horrid and the waitress that only had a few tables obviously had no training. Then somebody burnt bread in the kitchen which is not pleasant but to make matters worse I saw the owner or manager on duty spraying febreeze at the front door. Weird again but then he started walking by my table and a few others and spraying. My family was done but someone who just got their food must have given him a dirty look as he apologized and stopped. I have been to other paramount locations and this one is an embarrassment. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and tasty food. The beef humus was great! And the shish touwak was nice. The BBQ beef is AMAZING! Great addition to our neighborhood. Definitely will be one of my frequent dinner spots!"}
{"text":"I walked in on lunch hour and ordered take out! A little girl took my order and was very professional! It was cute! I ordered a San chicken shawarma with fries for almost $14! It was delicious but the portion of the San shawarma doesn't really justify the price! The fast though was amazing!   One thing I didn't like about the take out order is that u sown times feel lost about where to wait or who to give your order too.   I didn't wait too long for my order the whole transaction was about 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Fancy interior design of the resturant. Me and my friend ordered Shish Tawok (boneless chicken grilled) it was good tender and tasty. However, I had a bad experience with the bread and the chicken pizza. The crust is the worest ever!! Its horrible ist raw, not buffed! There is something wrong with it. I have been a good customer for years for Paramount and I know the real taste, but this was absoultly not eatable! The staffs and the manager were friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a (9\")Sandwich!!I paid 9$ to get a 9\" instead of 7\" (6$) and i got like 5\" sandwich.The manger said after wrap it, it will bcom lik this.THEN MEASURE IT AFTER YOU WRAP it!So disappointed this time!!!"}
{"text":"Pita is pita...except from Paramount! Something in the way they bake it or the dough ingredients...I dunno but whatever it is- keep doing it! I've eaten this pita the day after heated up in the microwave and it still tasted so good!   Anyway, again another resto that gives you complimentary pita appetizers straight from their oven steaming hot when you rip it open!  This time we bought for take out to feed a family of 6 grown adults. We ordered the babaganoush dip, cheese and spinach \"pizza\", and the full combo platter that came with 2 pitas and hummus dip. We called in advance, drove, and it was already ready! We were all very satisfied and everything was fresh and delicious!   I usually dine-in but this time we did takeout and will probably do it again next time!"}
{"text":"The food is out of this world.  Servers are great ...helpful, friendly, smiling.  This place can get crazy busy but it's absolutely worth the wait when you want a change from the more common take-out and casual dining choices.  Bring your clients here.  They won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and its quite the experience.  Arrive early during lunch/dinner rushes or you will be waiting for a table.  fresh pita delivered to your table is amazing.  portions are pretty big so be ready to share unless you're really hungry.  The last time I had the falafel sandwich and is very pretty good.  This time I went with Chicken Shawarma plate with rice..  I have to say it was very tasty!  It's not as cheap as takeout, but a little less than full sit-in.  So cost is reasonable and value is there since the portions and food are great.  There is so much more on the menu, and then there's desserts so plenty left to try out.  Go see for yourself as this place is a bit of a gem!"}
{"text":"Paramount was once well known for its quality and service. Now it's really all about it's service  What to expect: Order and Pay at cashier before you have your seat. You get fresh out of the oven pitta bread Sometimes fast sometimes slow service, depending on the crew and location.   The food. Let's not kid around, it's become a bit of a fast food thing where all the food should taste the same.. not so flavourful either to be honest."}
{"text":"I order take out often from this location. The food is delicious. Their service is great. The only thing I don't like is their fries, it's never hot and soft."}
{"text":"Tasty food.  Lentil soup is delicious.   Service is Good.  Prices are reasonable.   Really LOUD music!  Way to LOUD!!!   Seating is tight.   Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Got build your own bowl and it was TINY. Shape of the container is shallow and flat and not a bowl by any definition. There are very few toppings to choose from.   My friend got a chicken shwarma and didn't want any of the toppings and asked if he could have rice instead. They said no. So he was given a flimsy tiny chicken shwarma for $8.50. And they were rude about it too.   Would not recommend based on the people/service as well as poor value for portion sizes."}
{"text":"I have been to Paramount 4 times now. I did not receive one of my side orders 2/4 times. The customer service is very poor and needs improvement. One time my friend and I had to wait 20 mins (we counted) to be given a menu, that's the first thing a restaurant should do. It wasn't even that busy that day. If it wasn't for the affordable prices and average to good food, I would never return back. Yesterday we went to the Yonge location and that restaurant was an even bigger mess. No one was at the front of the restaurant to greet customers. We walked in finding ourselves confused and waiting for 5 minutes at the wrong place until we were told by an employee to take a seat. We sat and waiting another 10 mins until a waitress came and asked us if we had been helped. She told us to get back up and to order at the cash which we had already gone pass without being noticed by anyone in charge. Our appetizer never arrived even though the same appetizer was given to the table next to us. When we were leaving we told them what had happened to our appetizer and they didn't seem apologetic or concerned like they were used to things like this happening. Also didn't get a \"bye\" or anything at the end. Very bad customer service!"}
{"text":"So I was walking at Shops at Don Mills and was looking for something to eat and randomly came across the new Paramount....unfortunately it is really awkwardly located at Shops at Don Mills. The decor is amazing...food was good but a bit overrated. We got the chicken shwarma poutine and it was really underwhelming and trust me...I've had a lot of poutine in my life. The gravy was too thick and lacked flavour. Instead of getting the chicken shwarma plate as usual we got the shish tawouk and it was really tender and flavourful. For the price it just doesn't hit the spot."}
{"text":"Good food ruined by bad service... When we were living in North York, we frequented the Thornhill Paramount so our expectations were quite high. The decor is a little overdone as they were going for extravance.  Anyways, that didn't bother us as it was new and clean.  The food was on par with the other location. The freshly baked pita, hummus and dinner was on point. All this was let down by the service. It was very slow and we were kept waiting for water, napkins, the bill, etc. It was not clear who our server was and it just looked like everyone was disoriented.  I felt bad for asking for things because they looked so busy and believe me, the restaurant was only half full.  Hopefully, the service improve with time..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I came here while visiting from out of town. The 5 stars are for the kid-friendliness. The playground was so great to keep kids happy while the adults ate, and they had so much fun. We don't really have places like this at home! This was our 2nd time here, and the food is good. We ordered falafel, appetizer platter, sujuk sandwich, chicken & beef shwarma.... my favorites were the appetizers and the bread. Food is pretty fast. But the bottom line is - kids are happy, I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Food: horrible, tasted like everything was microwaved and none of the staff knew English.  Service: horrible  Not much else to say about here. Definitely wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing however I feel due to the fact that they have only been open for less than a month and a half at this location their customer service is severely lacking on the front end. When getting takeout, the cooks on the line are generally very friendly. But when placing my order in the front they tend to either be nervous, frazzled, or have close to no patience. I wish I could say that the food makes up for the poor service. But it's the whole experience that matters, how you are treated in an establishment makes the difference of night and day."}
{"text":"Dry meat n veggies..........and tastes like cafeteria food.   Service is friendly.   Really wanted to like this place as it is positions itself as a business with a social conscience.   Repeat: No  Save your money & go to Tabule!   Note: they're apparently opening a butcher shop next door. Get this right first before trying to chase more $"}
{"text":"Went here twice during a stay at the hotel in the same parking lot. Mixed experiences.   The first time the service was great and the shish tawouk wrap was fresh and delicious.   The second time the service was hectic and brusque, and the food was cold. I did like the mujadara I ordered, but would not recommend the soujouk sausage, which was dry and not very flavourful.   Still, a solid choice for a quick meal, and much better than Wendy's or Timmy's next door."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Paramount. I love Middle Eastern cuisine and didn't realize there was a location right in the heart of downtown!  Of course on a Saturday night it would be very busy here. I came here with my bf and another couple at around 10pm, and we were lucky that we got a table. The place was packed. Our seat was not the greatest as it was right by the stairs leading to the bathroom I believe? (The smell of bathroom cleaner was unbearable). The atmosphere in here was high energy crazy. Good for groups.  We ordered some great spreads/dips and my absolutely favorite was the Babaganoush (although it is called something different in Arabic here). Same concept thought: roasted eggplant, creamy and made better with Olive Oil. You dip the warm and fresh flat bread and it's heaven. The hummus was good too, but I would come here just for the Eggplant dip.  The rest of the dinner was entirely forgettable. Service was kind of funny. We had a waitress who forgot our drink orders and when taking our orders, stood there with hand on hip. Attitude much? As I mentioned, the environment is very hustle and bustle, and no wonder, located right near Yonge and Dundas.  I would suggest take out."}
{"text":"Okay, wow! This place is a diamond in the rough. A friend suggested it, and it was somewhere near Dixie and Eglington, but kind of off the beaten path, and I thought... where in the heck are we going?!?  We arrived, and it was pouring out, yet the line up was practically out the door!!!! Unbelievable. My first thought was \"Let's get the heck out of here and go somewhere warm\", but they assured us that it would only take about 10 minutes to get a table. The line up did move very quickly, and while I didn't time it, I think the hostess was pretty on the money with her estimate for our table.  One thing I will say which may be the only negative here is that the place is chaotic. It's noisy, boisterous, there are people coming and going, traffic jams... it's crazy. This is mostly because once you get your table, you have to get back up to go chose/order your food. I find this odd, because they have waiters who come and take your drink orders and bring your food to your table when its ready, which makes me beg the question, why don't the waiters just take your food orders too?!? I mean, for the price that you're paying, they really should be... My only rationale as to why they might not do this, is that there do tend to be a lot of Middle Eastern people working here, and there could perhaps be the occasional language barrier mishap, thought this could be avoided by moving to a simple sushi-like system where you order-by-number on a slip of paper that the waiter picks up at the table. I believe this would reduce the \"traffic\" in the restaurant by at least 50% and would actually expedite the entire dining experience.  Okay, so the food is where they really earn their 4 stars. Everything was delicious. I had the lamb, which was a bit on the chewy side, but was deliciously seasoned. My friends ordered the chicken shawarma and beef shawarma. Amazing. We also shared the beef hummus which was so good. They brought us a total of 4 fresh, FRESH, pita breads... it felt like the food just kept arriving. Even the plain, white rice tasted amazing for some reason. All of the dips and sauces that came with the different dishes were also tasty. I had to actually pack up half to take home, as I had laid eyes on my dessert and needed to save room. For dessert I had what I thought was going to be a normal custard tart with glazed fruit, but at my first bite, I was met with a heavenly surprise. The bottom of the tart was lined with a hard, milk chocolate that was hidden under the blanket of custard and fruit. Different from the usual. So good. So so good.   All of the staff were amazingly friendly also. In the end, I did think it was a tad pricey, but I would still probably go back, at least for take out!"}
{"text":"Take out or eat in, this place is fantastic!   Unlike the Mississauga location this location is full service. It is set up like a market with different counters preparing the different foods. The atmosphere is very casual, as are the service and presentation of the food.   The food is fantastic.   I am far from an expert on Middle Eastern food but I can tell you everything we ordered was fresh and full of flavour. The fatteh which was big enough to feed a few people would definitely be worth writing home about and comes with steam filled pitas (YUM, see the picture!) The Makanek Sandwich and Manakeesh were great too.    We saw a pretty steady stream of people throughout our meal come in exclusively to buy sweets to take home with them. At the end of our meal we walked up to the dessert counter to take a peak and were offered a few samples. WOW. These things are heaven in your mouth! Light, flakey, sweet, buttery heaven. I completely understand the steady flow of people taking these home. We ended up buying a bunch ourselves to share with friends.   I am already dying to go back and highly recommend you check this place out.   ***Tip: It gets BUSY so bring your patience***"}
{"text":"Wanted to leave a review for the new location on Rutherford road and hwy 410, but, I'm assuming this location is equally shitty.  Wow!! What happened to paramount?! We used to go to the one on crestlawn in Mississauga, before they started expanding at a rapid rate.  I went on a Monday for the 2 for 1 shawarma deal, BIG mistake!  The wraps were tiny and even though one was free, I still feel ripped off! It was cold and had some kind of tomato sauce on it and like 5 small pieces of chicken! Sucked big time! I understand that the owner(s) has huge overhead because of the new stores opening every week!but, damn! The wrap was the size of a soft taco at Taco Bell, but, not as good and it tasted like there was tomatoe sauce on it?! Wtf? Too expensive for what you get.  I predict these locations will close just as fast as they open. Never again.  I want my money back. Absolute crap"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy food! And wonderful service today :) we were happy. We got the mezza plate and the Saj wrap!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service we had today. An appetizer should not take 30 minutes to come when the restaurant isn't busy. Not to mention that the naan was of poor quality, and we had to ask for utensils.   Will not be coming here again; this place gives franchises a poor reputation."}
{"text":"Been searching long and hard for this particular spot on Yelp to review and as it turns out the city is incorrectly set as Markham when it should be Thornhill.  The name doesn't tell you anything but this is mainly a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern sort of café/resto. So if you like Shawarmas, Falafels, and the like, you will like this place.  This place has everything you could want for a good dining experience. Dining area is surprisingly large and tidy and you've got a variety of options surrounding you. Desserts, shawarmas and other goodies, coffee, pastry, and they give you free bread/pita as a bonus. The staff was great, servings large, well prepared, and fresh, very reasonable prices... I could go on and on but you get the picture."}
{"text":"Excellent food however watch out if you go there during their \" annual fasting \" times. Waiters will run you over en route to serving their preferred fasting clients never mind !"}
{"text":"Should have learned my lesson the first time. I'm not about writing bad reviews but I feel like this was necessary. I only came to this location after loving the location in London.  1st visit - customer service was the worst. Do I really have to ask for water and utensils 3 times?! There were some large parties there so maybe it was a bit hectic..  2nd visit - maybe the first time was a bad day for them? SO WRONG. Service was worse. The guy taking our order questioned why we only ordered 1 thing for 2 people. Again no water. We were visibly frustrated and the man cashing us out (owner?) asked if everything was okay, it wasn't but it didn't matter because we weren't coming back.  TAKE 3! Take-out has to be good, no customer service involved right? We ordered the mixed family grill combo, $80+ tax. Seriously?! This could feed 2 people AND they forgot the shawarma so we had to drive back to get it. I could have ordered multiple platters and had 5x more food.  Never in my life will I ever come here again."}
{"text":"Paramount would have usually gotten 4 or 5 stars from me in the past, but I've noticed the quality deteriorated over the past little while. It's an amazingly well-run business that's been really successful through rapid franchising, so some quality loss is expected. But still, the change is noticeable and I'm hoping the owner does something to fix it.  The location was pretty busy for a weekday lunch so that hasn't changed. The inside is really nicely decorated with a great atmosphere for families that's still very casual. Service can be hit or miss depending on the server, but this time around it was pretty good. Appetizers were great as usual - hummus, tabouleh, and kibbeh are delicious. I almost always get one of the meat platters and got the shish tawook this time. Portion size was still huge (mostly the rice). Considering that it's pretty expensive ($16) for some rice, vegetables, and two meat skewers - it really comes down to the quality of the meat.  This time around the chicken wasn't cooked as well as I would have liked and it didn't retain all it's flavour like it usually does on the grill. I'm hoping this was a one-off mistake rather than a new norm because their meat/food really was about the best you could get.  Realistically my family has been coming here for so long (since they only had one location at Dixie) so we'll be back. But if the lower quality in the food persists, there's plenty of new Arabic restaurants that offer a similar experience to Paramount springing up in Mississauga that could be a better alternative."}
{"text":"Safely still full from my dinner last night, and who wouldn't be as I ate ALL the pita, like all of it... twice. And I mean who wouldn't when they hand you a basket of hot outta the oven pita so fresh that it's puffed out to the size of a Rugby- HUGE!  I was surprised, that on a random Wednesday evening at around 8pm that this location was hopping. I would wager it was busier than most restaurants get to on a Friday/Saturday.  I've been to the Thornhill location before and I gotta be honest, if I'm paying sit down dinner prices, I kinda wanna sit down, order, eat and pay. None of this cockamamie order and pay at the front first like you're at Middle Eastern McD's, I mean come on. If you're saving money on labour hows about passing those savings onto the customers.   Anyway I digress, my gal and I were visiting at Credit Valley Hospital and stayed too late so needed to find food fast, and having been scanning the area earlier I knew awesome eats were close by.  I went straight for the good stuff, the mixed grill platter ($19.99) which came with a Shish Kebab (beef), Shish Tawook (chicken) and two Kebab Kafta (sorta like ground beef on a stick with spices - yum). It normally comes with an assortment of sides but I asked them get rid of all that noise and give me a proper serving of fatoush.   The grill was awesome, however I found the fatoush to not be the greatest. I've had (and made) amazing fatoush... this was sort of like having a caesar salad at Kelseys; all parts of the lettuce used, over dressed, quickly tossed, etc. Taste was there but not the best.  The lady had an assortment of healthier appetizers to make her dinner, comprised of: stuffed vine leaves, lentil soup and hummus with chicken. I got to try a little of each and I'll agree, their hummus is one of the best around, the vine leaves were OK, but not my fave item, and the lentil soup - wow! Totally caught me by surprise, beautiful texture, spice, taste, consistency. Amazing. I would strongly recco this soup.  The bill for two wasn't \"so\" bad (around $50 ish after tax and tip). I'd come back, just not for date night.  Eatcrest out!  PS - did you know Nazem Khadri of the TML's is there official spokesperson? Me neither! Crazy!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I would rate Paramount three stars both times.   Let's start off with the service.   The first time we came here, we asked one of our servers for water, and as she walked over to get it, we could easily hear her chiding her colleague for not bringing our water to us. As I'd like to say to the service at several other restaurants and cafes in Toronto, please keep your conflicts private and don't air them out in front of the customer, especially when it seems like a simple mistake.  The fattoush and beef pepperoni manakeesh (both starters) came out only slightly before our main plates did, so we had to stack our manakeesh on top of the bread basket, and I had to eat a bit off center of the table due to lack of space. (Awkward.) The fattoush and manakeesh were appetizing, but the chicken and beef shawarma plate was a bit cold (probably in part due to the fact that our plate order was not spaced out), and the chicken was superior to the beef, which was a bit greasy.  The second time we came here-- Along with the group of people at the table next to us (who arrived a bit after us) we were waiting for our order to be taken, and then for our food and drinks to arrive, for quite a while.  One server brought us our hummus. The server dashed off before I could ask him for pita to go with it (which I shouldn't have to ask for--they should always come together). Because we had nothing to eat the hummus with, save our hands, we were left to stare at the hummus in front of us. Another server, let's call him Mr. Drink Server, brought us our drinks. I asked for bread to go with the hummus, and Mr. Drink Server mumbled something in response. I didn't understand what he was saying, so I asked him to repeat it. He gruffly told me he wasn't our server. Okay, Mr. Drink Server, maybe you could provide your customer with a little service and ask the colleague of yours who *is* supposed to be serving my pita bread to serve said pita bread. Surely, you must understand it's a little confusing because one person took our orders, someone else brought out our drinks and more than one person brought our food out.  A man at the table next to us joked about the long wait and how it was \"part of the Arab experience.\" No, good sir, if this were happening in an Arab country, there would be a revolt. (Also, for the record, dining neighbors, hockey player Saad is Syrian, not Lebanese.)  During the meal, three different beggars reached in through the window, soliciting us for money with their coin-filled cups. The first man nudged my arm even after my husband shook his head no. The restaurant should really set the tables back farther in or get some security to prevent this from happening.  We ordered, besides hummus, manakeesh bil accawi and labban (ayran). In addition, I ordered a lamb kebab sandwich and my husband ordered a chicken shish tawouk sandwich. While the lamb was a bit chewy, it was juicy, and the pickles rounded out the sandwich nicely. My husband, who is Lebanese, did not finish his sandwich, a clear sign he didn't enjoy it. Perhaps he was left with the bitter taste of poor service and management."}
{"text":"Go early or be prepared to wait!  Although the decor/ servers/ ambience may remind you of Applebees, the food is anything but the boring generic Applebees fare (sorry, no offense to Applebee Lovers).    The menu is quite extensive, the style is middle eastern food.    Almost everyone around us (including ourselves) ordered an appetizer type dip which includes two large pieces of hot - steam releasing - pieces of puffy bread.  We tried the eggplant dip which had an underlying pomegranate note that was quite yummy.    The rice that accompanies the platter dishes is sooooooo yummy!  The meat is also quite flavourful and tasty.  The wraps are also quite good ... my mouth is watering just thinking about it :)  Prices are beyond reasonable - $10ish for a platter, $6ish for a wrap, $5ish for an appetizer.  Portions are generous.    Check it out!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Some decent Lebanese, though not exactly the best I've ever had. I had a zatar with labanee and the lamb sandwich. The flat bread was admittedly awesome and fresh -- straight from their wood oven. The labanee was respectable, the lamb was meh... quality-wise not quantity.  What this place does have going for it is that it's across from the Eaton Centre and it's a great alternative to the food court. It also has rows of ready-made salads for pick-up and it's kind of a cafeteria meets table service environment. The bread is great, lots of selection, lots of vegetarian options, really clean and attentive staff. ALSO the baklawa was superb and fresh.  I'd go back if i was nearby but probably wouldn't think of it first next time I have a craving for pickled turnips."}
{"text":"I'll have to return in hopes of having a better experience and I acknowledge that this is only based on two menu items but...  For those of you that know what butter chicken should taste like, avoid the butter chicken pizza at all costs. It has that distinctive and powerful \"generic curry powder\" flavour akin to Lipton's Chicken Noodle Soup powder.  The falafel sandwich had a good flavour but was a little mushy for my liking.  The place itself is immaculate and the dessert bars looked incredible. Again, I'll be back for perhaps a couple more authentic dishes (I know, I know, butter chicken isn't Middle Eastern cuisine), but based on the food I had and the incredibly slow service I endured, I have to stick with two stars for now."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. I come here several times a month and I always struggle deciding on what to order because I just love everything."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Long wait, very disorganized staff. People that ordered after me received their food before me. Too many people assembling the food & one not knowing what the other one has done. Small portions for what you get. Can get much better middle eastern food elsewhere Will definatly not return."}
{"text":"The service is beyond horrible, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't actually want customer to come. The restaurant looks decent food is good, but the service is perhaps the worst I have ever experienced. If you enjoy Paramount, do yourself a favor and go to another location."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean option especially since there aren't many options in this area for that. I love their manakeesh and platter options. The one thing is that their service is slow."}

{"text":"Paramount locations have been popping up across Toronto\the GTA like crazy lately. So obviously I needed to try it and see what the buzz was about.  Their shawarma is tasty. I only had a wrap and the flavours throughout were good with fresh ingredients. However I found the portion pretty small and the price is a little steep for a shawarma wrap."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of paramount but the last few times I've been very disappointed.  Got a Kafta Plate as take out yesterday and was shocked to see the size of the kafta kebabs. They've shrunk to 1/3! Plus they were broken! Plus they were burnt!!   Do check out my pic and review yourself.   My husband got a Zatar cheese manakish. And we're disappointed with that too. The zatar was all concentrated towards the centre of the Manakeesh and the cheese looked so dry.   My husband and I were raised in Middle eastern food so we know what to expect and this was just beyond our expectations and definitely not worth our money!  We are done with paramount."}
{"text":"This place is good. The problem is the name. You can't have fine foods in your name when your restaurant doesn't offer full service, big mistake. Food is very good and tasty. Prices are b tu reasonable, less than $20CAD or $15 USD per plate. I would recommend this plate but just remember it is not that fancy and do not expect food service. BTW the cheese desert is nothing like a cheesecake, flan or any other cheese desert you may be used to. It is literary melted cheese and sugar, it was a weird to me and not something g I would want to try again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE Service! We went to Paramount on my son's birthday because we heard the food was great. We'd made a reservation (and confirmed it the day before) but when we arrived, the staff didn't know anything about it and seemed inconvenienced by a large group (ten of us). All of the tables were full so we were seated at the very drafty take out table by the door. We waited for nearly twenty minutes for someone to take our order and around thirty minutes for water (!) and bread to arrive at the table. We waited a full HOUR for our meals to arrive, in the meantime putting up with huffy, eye-rolling waitstaff. It's too bad because when the food arrived? It was pretty good. Sorry Paramount, you need to teach your staff some manners and get organized."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Paramount but on my first visit, this location is definitely a let down in terms of food and service.  There is a take out area and sit in area. The sit in area is quite small and its hard to navigate around since you have to squeeze thru the aisle just to get around. The service was lackluster as well as servers were all over the place and did not pin point which tables to server.   We ordered hummus and it came quickly so we can dip it with the bread that they provided. Honestly, this was the highlight of the meal.  I had the tabliyeh saj beef shawarma and it was utterly dissatisfying. The wrap itself was very oily and lukewarm when it arrived. There was not that much beef in the wrap itself and the presentation on the wooden board is just ok.  I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This is so far the only Middle Easten restaurant I won't be going back to unless it was the last one remaining. I had 2 brochettes with salad and fries .. I remember the brochettes being dry, salad not so fresh and fries were TOO much (Not a bad thing ,I guess? So 1 star for that) . The service was slow, staff not very attentive. It wasnt the worst experience ever but I've to say that I had one of those rare moments where the waiter brings the bill and you feel bad for having to pay cause you just weren't satisfied with the food. Oh , the BIGGEST disappointment was when I noticed that this Middle Eastern place doesn't have the famous garlic potatoes  , like WHY !? :S   The other star would be for not having to wait to be seated and that it's an affordable place (yet I didnt feel like paying so imagine my disappointment.)"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out after having shawarma in Ottawa to compare and expected to be thoroughly disappointed, and guess what ...I was! Flavours and quality of the food = dismal, portion size = inadequate, value = over priced, service = average but the servers should learn to have a little bit of charm.  Not coming back here unless they change it to be more like Shwarma Palace."}
{"text":"Panera bread style over priced middle eastern fast food. I took mixed grill platter which was $22 and even though it was filling I don't think the taste can demand such a high markup. The chicken brochette was undercooked, the chewiness was evident with each bite. I didn't return the plate because it was Ramadan and I know the staff were working really hard during Iftar ( when people break fast) so didn't want to bother them with this. But even if the chicken was cooked properly, I wouldn't pay so much for this quality food. My ultimate bill came up to $35 including a Kinafe dessert, tax and tips. With that much, I can go for a super classy and delicious restaurant experience in Montreal."}
{"text":"extremely busy but our server, Al was so nice and pleasant ... tried hard to make everyone happy ... great guy, just wanted to recognize his service  food is the usual, garlic and hot sauce with their free bread is amazing ... always fill up on that before I even get to my main dish   5/5 stars for Al 4/5 stars for food"}
{"text":"I had been to Paramount many times before but it's been a while since my last visit. I was truly disappointed with my last visit. Ordered Chicken shawarma platter. The quality of chicken was not good and as well I was not happy with the quantity. Pita was fresh and good. Not visiting this place again. I find Pita & Grill much better both in terms of quality and quantity.   I will though recommend their Minakish (wood oven pizza) and sweets."}
{"text":"Food  Meat is dry tasteless takes a very long time to prepare. Even the fresh bread from the oven takes ages to be served. Food most of the time is brought to us cold. The only good thing is the juice. Every time I eat there with my friends we all get an upset stomach!   Service It ruines everything. The servants are arrogant, not attentive, most of the time I was there they take more than 15 mints to be seated, 15 minutes to pay attention to us and take the order, and 30-40 minutes to get the food. Eating there completely ruines anyone evening.   Seating arrangement   Tables are too close to each other and seems crowded. Upstairs seating is worse service will forget about you there and you will feel trapped   Overall, it is not worth the money you will pay. I told this to the restaurant management on two different occasions with no improvements!"}
{"text":"While my review is slightly tardy, as our Sunday Brunch UYE was several weeks ago now, I still have a vivid memory of my experience at Paramount Fine Foods. I'd seen their name pop up in several past Yelp searches but the reviews seemed to be a tad skeptical and widely across the spectrum, there really was no true north as to whether this place was good or not.   I always enjoy visiting a place and eating as the locals or regulars do, I feel it gives me a true insight into what the experience is like for these folks. After living in Windsor, ON for the better part of two years (the middle eastern food capital of Ontario - no joke), I can safely say that I have had the best and worst cuisine available and am somewhat of a Caucasian Middle Eastern Food Aficionado, meaning \"A white boy who knows his shit.\"     It was easy to get excited upon walking into PFF as the hustle and bustle of a busy brunch crowd was still packing this place at 2PM. I loved it, families eating together, laughing and joking - great atmosphere!  Aesthetically, there was nothing extravagant about the design of this place, however the dessert counter which stretched around more than half of the restaurant (order by the pound) was certainly something to behold. I was ready to skip brunch and move right to dessert right then and there! Next time... next time.  Paramount is a sit down restaurant where you order your food and drink up at a central cashier/counter and they bring it out to you. A little different of an approach then I was used to, but with the buzy revolving door of customers going through this place I can see no other way.   We ordered Manaakeesh Zaatar which is essentially mixed herbs rubbed in a thick layer across a flattened pita bread. I've had Zaatar many times before and the graininess of it is something I just can't fully get into - no strike against PFF, just not my bag of crispers.  We then moved into the meat of our meal - literally! Hummus with cooked chicken arrived next followed by the Mixed BBQ platter. At the exact same time the home made pita rolled out and freshly cooked these bad boys were puffed up like frog to near the size of football (CFL size to be exact).   This was wear PFF made some serious points with me: The chicken and hummus was beautiful, perfect amount of olive oil in center so as to not water down the hummus but also provide enough lubrication for easy smear and dip... plus nabbing a hung of cooked chicken with each bite was awesome. Meanwhile the mixed BBQ was very nicely cooked. The one thing I enjoy most about middle eastern cuisine is that they don't over-season and more often then not its juicy. Full points for them here!  Our order was suffice for about 4-6 people, and I know personally that I left full. The complimentary self serve, cardamom flavoured coffee was a first for my palate (not a fan). But as they say when in Rome...  I'm disappointed I was too full to mow down at least one Baklava as they shined with sticky sweet glazed goodness. *shakes fist*.   I'll be back Paramount... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. So delicious. Extremely friendly staff! Love middle eastern food and this place is awesome."}
{"text":"We visited this place while passing through thornhill and were not disappointed at all! There were a lot of options to chose from, very friendly staff- they actually explained all the dishes and options as soon as they knew it was our first time at their restaurant. Our order was prepared very fast considering the place was very busy at the time. And the food tasted amazing as well! Will definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst value for your money.  The menu does NOT reflect what you are actually getting. Ordered a fattoush salad with a beef skewer which the menu shows as two (2) skewers and got the salad (rather small portion) and one (1) skewer.  All this for about $20 for a take out lunch.  Stay away and avoid a bad experience.  If it helps, me va me a better choice (fair distance away) or any other nearby place at the village. Understand new location but not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got such high marks. We ordered the lamb sandwich and beef shawarma both of which were dry, seemingly tasteless, and difficult to eat. While I like pita bread I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do with two pieces of pita bread without anything to dip it in."}
{"text":"a  very good neighbourhood restaurant. It is part of a large chain but does not feel chain like. The hummus is the best I have ever tasted  and the salads and kabobs are also excellent. Some times food delivery is quick and sometimes it takes longer than it should but if you have the hummus and pita to nibble on the wait is manageable"}
{"text":"The absolute worse dining experience I've ever had! So my friends and I were talking about going to dinner and I kept raving about paramount saying how much of a delicious restaurant it is. I usually go to the location on yonge and Steeles but this location on Shepard was closer to where we were. That was the biggest mistake, I wish we would have driven a little further for a better experience. We ordered our food and not only was it was cold as ice, we had to return it all and get hot food which took another 29 mins to come. We didn't get anything to drink until we asked 3 times. We ordered a side of hummus and a side of baba ganoush and we had a lot of leftovers so we wanted pita to go and they say no you need to pay 50 cents for an extra pita???!!! Huh??!!! Did we not just spend over $60 at this worthless place anyway? And why can't they stick to one server per table so that you can build a relationship with that one person and not have 4 or 5 different people come and ask you if you need anything and what not. This restaurant is all over the place. I'm so disappointed that I suggested this restaurant to my friends. They were not pleased and were left wondering why I kept raving about this place. And I don't blame them one bit. Such a disappointment and I definitely will not be coming back here ever again. And I strongly recommend no one else does either."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out when I saw that it was opening. It is a sit-down restaurant, but they do offer take out as well. As it was quite busy the night I went, I decided just to get take out. I was a little confused with where I was supposed to go at first, but the host was really helpful and gave me a menu to look at and told me where to order. I ordered the falafel sandwich and the hummus. The prices were pretty standard and the portion sizes were good. The hummus is definitely for sharing as it comes in a large container (about the size of those Summer Fresh dips you can buy at the grocery store) and with 2 large pieces of pita bread. The presentation of the hummus was nice with the chickpeas on top, and I liked that they warmed up the pita as well. The falafel sandwich was not bad but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I just found it was a little bit dry. That being said, I still enjoyed my meal and can definitely see myself returning (probably for take out) again in the future."}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this place! It's like they took a bit of the Middle East and stuck it right in the heart of Toronto. The felafels manakeesh and lentil soup totally hit the spot. The fresh baked steaming pita that comes to your table is icing on the cake. Ohhhh don't forget to get the layered cocktail! Ps I'm not rating the service at all which is all over the place.. But with food this good I don't care if I have to flag them a couple of times, however I can see how it can be annoying if you come in a big group"}
{"text":"have been going here routinely for years, & staff is mostly helpful, good food, & if there's issues, I recommend talk to 1 of the managers, of the 2 managers, the other is NOT very helpful (slightly rounder face), not the most pleasant, too pushy when saying we should come more often, but the other 1 is quite accommodating when it comes to changing some things around the way I want them. overall, whenever we don't have time, its 1 of our top go-to places. reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Busy place with nice ambience.Waiters seems to be in hurry.We were given somebody's else food.waiter was in no mood to give us time.Finally when the bill came we were charged for something we never ordered.When we pointed out this to the lady at billing counter she started arguing.I would say average food and not authentic Lebanese."}
{"text":"So far, so good! I have only eaten here once and I had their lentil soup with chicken shawarma plate and the free pita bread they offer with every table. Price is considerably cheap, not gonna argue there. Service was decent, my server made sure my friends and I were eating well and enjoying our food. Food tastes pretty good, though nothing amazing. I would definitely come back here just because I love Middle Eastern food and this is a pretty cheap joint with good food!"}
{"text":"Tried the following dishes: 1. Philly Shawarma Pizza - Beef Shawarma, peppers and onions, topped with melted mozzarella cheese.  Liked the dough - fluffy and fresh. Unfortunately the beef was dry.  2. Chicken Shawarma Sandwich  - Shredded pieces of chicken grilled on a rotating spit with shredded lettuce, pickles and garlic sauce wrapped in a pita  I really loved this, and chicken is usually at the bottom of my meat list. The chicken was very tender and tasty and the sauce just brings out the delicious flavour without overpowering the chicken.   3 .Beef Shawarma Sandwich - Shredded pieces of beef grilled on a rotating spit with fresh parsley, onions, turnips, pickles, tomatoes and tahini sauce wrapped in a pita  Being a beef person, I was a little disappointed with this. The overall wrap was salty. The beef was kind of dry, which the sauce had to make up for. The sauce overpowered the beef taste. Completely the opposite taste experience from Chicken Shawarma Sandwich."}
{"text":"- industrial area-hidden restaurants are always fun to dine at. esp if they're stellar. paramount... is average - granted, it's one of the few place in the area that have manakeesh (kind of like a flatbread with all sorts of wonderful toppings)...  - their shawarmas are crap. sorry to say. the chicken was dry as a desert. it makes me miss montreal and ottawa."}
{"text":"Would have gladly given this place 4 or 5 stars in the past. The fresh pitas are delicious, as is the manoushe, and the grill plates. I personally love the mixed grill plate (though bring a friend to share or be prepared for leftovers).  The zataar with cheese is an explosion of flavour.  There have been a couple of changes though recently. They no longer offer complimentary hummus with the pita. I also tried their shawarma which was awful (didn't even closely resemble the taste I expect from shawarma). The service in the restaurant is really show: a function of the fact they under consistently understaff. If your server comes by, make sure you ask for everything conceivable in that order, cause you might not get another chance."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Has the beef and chicken schwarma. Very good, not your typical fast food but quick. Servers were very pleasant. Good alternative to the normal burger and fries places!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good things to write about Paramount, So here it goes..  The food quality is very good, its always fresh, the Kabobs are made to order,  they are one of few restaurants that makes fresh Pita bread all day everyday.  their pita bread pizza are simple yet amazing, shawarma and salads are also decent.  They changed their hot sauce and its the bomb, its roasted red pepper hot sauce instead of just regular crushed tomatoes, they improved their garlic sauce too (used to suck )   They have fresh Turkish coffee on the house for all customers they don't charge extra for bread if you are dinning in, so you can eat as much as you want  They have a bakery, cafe and juice bar, all pretty decent, if you have not been to   now couple of cons, they hiked up their prices I believe across the board, when it comes to Shawarma they pre-slice it and  in leave in one of those water food warmer  ( i hate places who pre cut their Shawarma and they also serve pre cooked fries, its not to order, if they have old fries sitting in a warmer, they will serve you that I hate that as well..you could just tell, also I was standing in front of them it took them seconds to pack my order   Oh yeah the customer service varies, sometimes it could rude, or obnoxious, and others times it could be really good, their Eglinton location has been pretty good to me so far apart from the stale fries  Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"I went to paramount tonight to grab a quick dinner, I soon as I walked in I was greeted by a friendly host/server, then went to the counter to order, I really like their Fatoosh Salad, it contains: Mixed greens, red and yellow bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and garnished with toasted pita bread, also added Beef Shawarma to my salad for $3.00+   The Shawarma is also served on top of a pita bread, they use the Pita bread as a liner.  All in all, its was fresh and pretty good.  PS. it comes with Mediterranean dressing (vinaigrette kind of ) but I also ask for Garlic sauce and their house made roasted red pepper hot sauce, the hot sauce is the BOMB!  Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Made the mistake for choosing this location today ( which also happened to be the celebration of Eid)   They were understaffed and the few people at the check in counter at the entrance has no clue as to how to manage the queues and the sequence of customers.  Consequently queues became longer, customers became impatient specially when we could all see plenty of vacant tables and an entire patio which they chose to keep non functional on a day like this when they ought to have expected a larger crowd.  Overall sad to see a place with great food being so grossly mismanaged,   Not coming back to this location in a hurry.  Eid Mubarak anyway"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant for a while now and finally tried it out. Coming on a weekday, the restaurant was pretty empty. The restaurant is quite spacious and there were only 2 tables seated.   We waited to be seated and let me just say that the lighting here is on point. It's so bright and the interior is very nice. We were given the menus and a fair bit of time to look at the menu. We ordered the Paramount Favourites which are the Mezza Plate and the Mini Mixed Grill Plate and shared it between two people. Both are great options if you're looking for variety.   The Mezza Plate has 3 different items. There is the Moutabbal (smoked eggplant), Tabbouleh (a Levantine vegetarian dish made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur, and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt), and hummus. I personally really liked the Moutabbal and the hummus as they were rich but not too overwhelmingly heavy. The Tabbouleh has a strong aroma to it so I wasn't something I preferred. However, it's a great palate cleanser.   The Mini Mixed Grill Plate is definitely good for sharing. There is also the Mixed Grill Plate which is a regular size of this. You get the option of choosing fries or white rice on the side. We chose white rice. They give a lot of rice and it's seasoned so it's not just plain white rice. It comes with BBQ Striploin Beef, Shish Tawouk, and Kafta served with grilled tomatoes and onions, a piece of spicy pita bread and a side of hummus and garlic sauce. The spicy pita bread is a good spicy it's a mild but flavourful spicy. The Kafta was juicy and the softest of the three. I found the Striploin Beef to be a bit hard.   The waiter was quite attentive. I dropped one of the spoons and the moment I looked up, he came holding a plate and new utensils.   There's also a slide like McDonald's for children to play in near the entrance which is perfect for families with young children.   Overall a great experience here. Even though there weren't that many customers, there was a bit of a wait to get the server to come to our table."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Always a pleasure eating at any of their restaurants."}
{"text":"We bought some small spinach pastries to go.  They were pre-wrapped, without date or indications of any kind.  When I got home I removed plastic wrap and the sides had alot of mold.   Terrible.  If a business is going to pre-wrap pastries, they have to put some date on the package, so they can ensure some quality level they are giving customers.  Very simple, glaring error.  We had eaten there earlier in the night, and the eat-in food was ok.    FWIW, the restaurant on Yonge and Dundas is better."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location on an occasion or two and the food quality, service and portions are always delicious and consistent. This was until I decided to order delivery.  I ordered a shawarma sandwich and fattoush salad for delivery one afternoon and the end result was extremely disappointing. While the taste was there, and as I remembered it, the shawarma sandwich was barely an appetizer size, let alone a proper lunch. There were 2 tiny pieces of shawarma meat, and no veggies or sauce.  I tried to call to inquire and was put on hold and never reconnected. This experience made me sad.  Lesson learned, delicious food in the restaurant but heavy corners cut during delivery  Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"You have to taste it to believe it.  Look no longer for middle-eastern food!    We ordered the platter which was perfect for two people.  After ordering (cafe styled) we were asked our table number.  After 2 minutes we were served freshly baked hot pita bread with hummus --FOR FREE!  The service was much more than you would expect from a behind the counter, bakery styled restaurant. Besides the server bringing the appetizer at the beginning, there were also several quality checks with our food.  I like it when a restaurant confirms their guests satisfaction.    Recommendation   I am a huge starbucks fan... and if you do go to Paramount, make sure to order a cappuccino because they are delicious.   All I need to say is the prices are great, and the taste is exquisite.  You have to taste it to believe it."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, Paramount was recommended by my parents but I was surprised and a little wary based on the 3 star rating on Yelp. The atmosphere is quite nice upon first arrival. As a mother of a toddler, being told there was a separate play area...YES!! The play area was similar to McDonald's (but with better food). I liked that families with kids were in a separate side of the restaurant so we aren't disturbing parties without screaming/crying kids.Being a vegetarian, I will limit my comments to the falafel wrap and various dips. Everything was freshly made and very flavorful. The coffee (cafe latte) was really good with a touch of cinnamon. Previous comments criticized the service but we have 5 star servers. They visited us numerous times made sure we had water, free bread and even offered us free dips & coffee.  We had a lovely dinner, I recommend giving this place a try for a casual high quality meal."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma's I have had in TO. The sandwich was only $5.99 which I consider a very economical meal in downtown core. They also serve hot bread on every table.   I went for lunch and got in just before the crowd.  I highly recommend this place for a good Middle Eastern treat!"}
{"text":"Spicy shish tawouk and the beef shawarma sandwiches are to die for. Service is fast and friendly, awesome bang for the buck.  The baklava is great, too. Five pieces for $3/4."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. But the portions are really small and the service was terrible. There was a manager/owner and employee behind the counter. The employee just did not seem happy to be there. Was pissed off the whole time he was taking and preparing the order. Unimpressed with the overall experience. Waste of prime Toronto real estate"}
{"text":"This place isn't as good as all the hype. The food is dry and burnt. I wonder if that's just the way this food is...."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best and most delicious Middle-Eastern food in North America, and I meant it!  I went there thinking it would be like any other Middle-eastern restaurant in Dearborn and Canada, but it was not. No comparison at all, absolutely great food.  In terms of the food, you must try their beef shawarma, it's super delicious, and that's coming from a me, who doesn't eat or like red meat. Also, their Paramount fruit drink is very yummy. In summary, you must go.   The place itself is crowded, and the interior of the place is very casual sit down place, but the service is great. The prices are very responsible too."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer at the downtown location and they have excellent service and the food is great.   Once I found out they had recently opened a Paramount at Sheppard and Victoria Park, I was very excited to go.  I have attended this spot numerous times as Paramount is one of my favorite places to go to and they have had horrible service every single time I have gone there.   I won't go through the entire list of unfortunate visits and will mention the most recent. They had gotten our order wrong and I told them that we had ordered something else. The waiter went to the chef and in plain view I saw the chef get frustrated and the waiter came back to tell us that they were out of our ordered item. Later on, I saw they had brought what we had originally ordered (that they said they were out of) to another table. I brought it up with them and they weren't very understanding and were just trying to cover up their blatant lie.   They had also burned our food where I could taste the charcoal off of it. I asked them to replace this and they brought out a skewer of shish tawouk that contained 3 pieces....how this even qualified as a skewer is beyond me.   HORRIBLE SERVICE. BURNT FOOD EVERY TIME. LYING STAFF. 5 VISITS TOTAL (kept them giving them the benefit of the doubt - never again.)   WE CAN'T BE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED HORRIBLE SERVICE THIS FREQUENTLY AT THE VICTORIA PARK AND SHEPPARD LOCATION.   I WILL JUST TRAVEL TO THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION FROM NOW ON."}
{"text":"9pm on a Saturday night and this place is packed with people, many young adults due to the mall presence. Given the crowd, we decided to order take-out. It turned out to be a very bad idea since they screwed up our order (fries != rice) and almost forgot my drink.  There was a group of 8 who changed their minds twice on what to order - so we waited a good extra 20 minutes before getting our food. If the food had been worth getting, not a huge deal, but I can't believe this place thinks they serve authentic Middle Eastern cuisine.  I ordered a \"Paramount Special\", which is a fruit drink with kiwi, mango, strawberry in it. It's not too bad for a sugar bomb but doesn't actually finish well and not worth the $7.  (I think my mango juice at the zoo today was better.)  My husband ordered a lamb shawarma plate where the hummus was runny and the fries were cold and greasy.  It was a decent portion of lamb, just very bland.    Overall, our meal was not worth the price or time, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Good food, mediocre service. They charge $0.50 for everything (from hot sauce, garlic sauce to ketchup) which is a bit annoying - I mean this stuff should be built into your prices (which aren't cheap)."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had an awful experience yesterday at this location. The kitchen seemed busy however understaffed and the staff seemed very frazzled. Saying that I ordered a pita to go and waited over 15 minutes without anyone checking on me. The shish tawook pita was very underwhelming and not worth the price. As I was eating it i thought to myself the chicken seems poor quality. Low and behold I'm up with food poisoning today. Total disappointment"}
{"text":"Normally when I eat at paramount at their various locations it's always a pleasurable meal and experience.   However, I had ordered a chicken shawarma from their food truck (yes they have paramount on wheels!) and I was disgusted by quality of the shawarma.   Furthermore, cost me $7 which is average. But they only put pickles small chicken and lettuce. I'm not sure if the food truck ran out of veggies, but I was definitely annoyed.  I could have made the dryer out pita lettuce sand which at home for free.  I didn't have time on my lunch to go back to talk to them so I returned on my following break they were already gone.    Not impressed. I would give them 0 if that was an option."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service at this location is constantly bad. My food takes forever to come out, and the servers get mad if you ask for anything else afterwards."}
{"text":"While the pita bread was excellent -- fresh and puffy like golden pillows -- the rest of the food was pretty much average, and with much more oil than I would normally like.    While it is customary to dribble a little oil on top of dishes (such as the hummus), these were swimming in it.  And it even prevented the bread in the fattoush from cripsing properly.  Cheese bread was soggy due to pooling of oil.    The chicken wasn't dry but was not properly seasoned.    Staff was pleasant, but a bit difficult to locate at times.  One thing which needs to be rethought is the lighting.  It is far too bright and really heats up the dining room.  Dimming them slightly would result in a more pleasant dining experience.  All that being said, I'd still rather go here than to any fast food restaurant or food court place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It's a blessing to have Paramount in so many places where there was no option of getting halal food. Quality if food is always good. Hummus and garlic sauce and their platters are mouth watering. Also love the fresh pitas. Baklwa is good too."}
{"text":"2nd time here and is still an amazing experience with interesting Mediterranean food. Great special this month."}
{"text":"Veey good experience when I went. Food came quickly and was delicious. Service was good, often checking up on us. The venue itself was clean but a tad bit crowded. The price point is ideal for a downtown location. Would come here again and woild recommend to anyone in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I was a regular here but over the past year the service quality had gone down a lot.  From getting orders completely wrong to making us wait forever to be even asked about drinks.  The last time I was there a couple of months ago; I ordered the dessert Knafeh and after tasting something off in the first bite I flipped it over to find black/burnt looking mold on the bottom.  I definitely lost any desire to order another piece as suggested by the waiter or even return there again.  It is unfortunate because I have always brought people here and always bragged about the foods.  I will post a picture if I can figure out how later on."}
{"text":"This is a standard location for this chain. It can be a bit of a wait to be seated because it can be busy but the food  is good and flavours are good for all the options. It can be a little chaotic but you do have the option to pay at front and then get your order which makes it a good quick lunch or grab and go takeout spot. This is one of the bigger locations too so it's a bit more spacious."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Try their manakeesh. So yummy. Bread is always always fresh. Paramount special cocktail is super heavy but worth the price"}
{"text":"This place is like a party at your best friends place! As soon as you walk in you greeting with a huge smile and Impeccable service.  Their mannerism to their hospitality is designed to the best possible professionalism.  I have been here a few times now.  You can tell management is doing something right when all the employees are going out of their way to help you with your order.  Paramount is new to me and they hear me towards the best dishes and to enlighten and expand my palate even more they give me fun sweets treats complimentary!!!  Everything is fresh and  flavourful!!  Also this maybe a coincidence but everyone is attractive too!!! (I think I'll come here more often).    So I'm standing in this restaurant at the moment. The place is packed. Bring your families here, bring your friends. It never dined in but I'm walking around. They have a playroom and a prayer room !!!! Yes I said playroom too!!!!   Amazing experience each time. Can't wait to go home and eat :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years and stopped because of the absolutely horrible customer service. I will not share my experiences because I feel they no longer apply. I came during the week with my brother and tried some items that were new on their menu. When I came I did not recognize any of the old faces that I had issues with so we decided to give it another shot for old times sake and cause its the closest halal place we have to eat-in near home.  We got: -Yalla Poutine: Basically fries with garlic sauce, hummus and chicken shawarma on top- GOOD -Kebbeh: quality has really gone down, these used to be large, crispy and full, we found when we ate it this time it didn't have much feeling, even some air inside -Mixed Grill: I always get this and it was as good as I remember, nice that you get to try 3 different types of meat, I would reccomend this if it's your first time -Pepperoni Manakeesh: Delicious as usual  One thing I will say is that things did not come in order, we got our Kebbeh (appetizer) last which used to happen before and the fries portion of our mixed grill came significantly later, this just happen to be okay cause we still had the Yallah poutine, we ended up taking those fries home. Compared to the service this location used to have this was quite an improvement. I am still a bit skeptical but will try again.   PS I heard their new SAJ wrap is awful, stick with the regular wrap"}
{"text":"Went here to try the location. I've been to the Erin Mills location before this one and I gotta say, the Erin Mills location is much better. The staff here are a little distracted. They got our order fine, but sat us at not a very clean table... (Used the menu to clean it off) the falafels were over salted, but everything else tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try food from here forever and finally got the opportunity. However it was nothing memorable. The chicken shawarma plate was overpriced and the chicken was overcooked. I paid for extra sauce and still didn't get it. The chicken was also very scarce. Definitely not worth it"}
{"text":"A great place with very nice environment. Friendly staff, loved their complementary bread. Food was awesome. Definitely would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Got a Shwarma Plate with beef, chicken and rice as well as some Zatar. I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern Food and wanted to give this location of Paramount a chance. I've had a hit and miss time with their location at Yonge and Dundas   first impression was that this location is a bit classier but there still needs to be more room and more organization for takeout. I ordered at the back and then had to go to the far side and a tiny counter at the back to wait.   Pluses: Rice was quite nice  Pita was piping hot Zatar was really good  Cons: Chicken was a bit dry They really skimped on the sides of pickled veg  Overall an okay meal for $20+   I would go back but would probably try some other dishes."}
{"text":"For clarity, this is for their location in Dundas square.   Went there last night. as i had Family visiting from out of town and they wanted Mediterranean.  Since i am fairly new to toronto, i had heard of this place from friends. (this place was preferred by our party of 6, since 2 were in need of Halal meat)  We took a cab there. It was busy. The whole place was uncomfortably hot. After waiting 10 minutes, we got a table was was in their main dining hall downstairs.  It was too hot to sit there, so when we asked for another table, the host refused to consider our request unless we vacated that table first. (let alone allowing us to order in that table and moving us if something else was available) so we got standing again.  Finally, we were able to find a booth upstairs. The server was very friendly, considering it was past 10 pm on a saturday night and he was serving upstairs while the kitchen was downstairs.  Food came fairly quickly. and was overall very good. The freshly grilled meats were good as well as the hummus. but the shawarma meat leaves a lot to be desired. (chicken and meat)   @ katerina.  I have also heard that the north york location has better food. @ Laura. This location does need to have better air/temperature management downstairs. the beef shawarma i got in my plate was stewed meat at best."}
{"text":"Their food used to be good a few years ago. Now they have significantly hiked up their prices and made their portions much smaller. Their food is not as fresh anymore and the quality has really diminished. The food it pricey and not worth it. There are much better middle eastern restaurants in the GTA at a fraction of the price. My husband and I went about a week ago. I won't be going back. So disappointed. We ordered the \"fresh\" pita, which used to be melt in your mouth delicious. But this time it wasn't. It was dry, crispy. Not puffy, hot and soft. The hummus with chicken was ok. Chicken was a bit dry though. We also ordered beef koftas which were pretty tasty but basic. Again, I'm comparing it to how it was about 3-5 years ago and to other current Arabic restaurants. They also got rid of their huge bakery and baklava / desserts selection. Trying to be more modern I guess. It's not working. Not sure why they tried to fix something that wasn't broken. The service is also terrible. Very slow even when there aren't that many people around. Not the friendliest customer service. Too bad, it used to be one of my favourites. Just not worth your money."}
{"text":"Paramount is probably a very safe choice for a family outing or with a large group of picky friends. However this safe factor means there is nothing to get excited about, everything is just very usual and normal. The selection of main courses is somewhat limited when compared to other side dishes they sell!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, and great service.ive been going here for years and, despite almost always being packed, their staff provide great and timely service.   I'm not a big fan of their shawarma, but their plate dishes are really good, especially the half chicken."}
{"text":"Hell hath no fury like a yelper scorned, or forced to wait 25 minutes for cold take out.  I used to like Paramount. The mountains of fresh bread, the zaatar, the shwarmas. Sure it was chaotic but the food was good and thats all that mattered.  Today I went to pick up some dinner before a late shift at work. I wanted the zaatar pizza and kifta pizza as well as the Shish Touk. I waited patiently for 20 minutes while the world was chaos around me. Turns out they have both a bakery and a meat station. No one told me until 20 minutes in by which time everything was stone cold from sitting on the counter. The zaatar was decent but the shisk touk was really marginal. Sorry to say I'm going to be staying clear of Paramount until they are better organized."}
{"text":"After being here numerous times for amazing sandwiches I was extremely disappointed today to wait over an hour with 2 of my coworkers and not receive our food  at  table of 10  . Which I had to then take back to my office to eat . I'm not even sure I want to go back for take out . Very Unprofessional"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. First time wasn't a good experience, it was close to when it first opened. My friend was holding his birthday here and get had to wait very long despite making a reservation.  Other times has been okay, I come here because the food is healthy and delicious plus you get large portions. The hot sauce is also very good.  I had the mixed platter and it was okay. I find that the Chicken shawarma to be pretty good. I recommend either getting a humus for the pita or use the garlic sauce.  Tip: They might try to give you a bad seat next to the cold windows, ask to move. Upstairs is very cozy.  Food 4/5 Service 3.5/5 Ambiance 4/5 Value 4/5  =========  Overall 3.8/5"}
{"text":"Great location, tasty food and affordable!  Best pita bread I've had in a long while! Great selection and awesome service. The pizza wasn't all that great, especially the vegetarian pizza was full of extra veggies. The hummus appetizer could be served in a plate or something instead of a plastic container. They're quite busy from lunch to dinner so don't expect for a quick service. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Sitting here with a giant mound of rice which is supposed to be their shawarma platter. At first I thought it's way too much rice but once you taste how bad the shawarma is you'll be eating a lot more of the rice. The beef shawarma is dry and gamey, the chicken shawarma is rubbery. Sure if you order it in a wrap they'll just cover it in garlic and you won't notice but taste the meat and chicken on it own and you'll see hat I'm referring to. Their humous is decent but don't get their hot sauce. It's basically spicy tomato sauce. Service was horrible. I was given a warm can of pop, had to ask for utensils after my food had arrived, not one person has asked me if I need anything or how everything is. I'm giving it two stars based on how clean the place is. That's it! I left my plate as you see it in the photo."}
{"text":"I got a cup of tea that was already brokcen, but glued and sticky to the touch..The lamb cabobs were overly done and hard to eat. When i complained I was told that I ordered them this way. They changed the cup of tea, but no apology"}
{"text":"A (well) hidden gem. Step out of industrial Mississauga and into the souk; so authentic there is a prayer room in the back. Sort of like a Middle Eastern Marché, you order from separate counters for dinner, drink and sweets. Pay for the lot as you leave, and be sure to take away a box of sweets. Busy at lunch time. The mixed grill plate will give you a taste of everything, and ample reason to return to this spectacular restaurant. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Actually a 2.5 stars.  The reason I gave it such a low rating was because they forever to bring us our food. I'm talking like upwards of 45 minutes. Completely unacceptable as none of us ordered anything out of the ordinary (just regular chicken and beef platters).  I personally got the chicken platter and it was good. Definitely had much better platters, but it wasn't bad. It was a bit on the pricier side though. Their bread is good to snack on while you wait for the food to arrive - very easy to eat a few buns without even thinking about it.   Overall, I would probably not be coming back here as the service was subpar, and won't be recommending this location to a friend."}
{"text":"Went there for group dinner during Black Friday weekend. It was super crowded so we had to wait. For large group it was even harder to get tables. However, the servers still tried to arrange us tables, and finally we got a corner to squeeze in. In busy time like that, they could have refused us. But they still worked hard in finding us tables, so we wouldn't have lost our party and strayed on the road. So considerate!  Their food was great too, the shawarma I ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I am a fan of the Yonge St. location and was expecting the same standards. The people beside us left after waiting for 40 mins and we ate our appetizer (eggplant dip) and received our main before they received anything. I had a chicken shawarma dinner and it was terrible. Chicken was dry, like they cut the chicken off the rotisserie hours ago and reheated it a couple of times. We watched the kitchen staff laugh and chat as we waited for our food and most of the waitresses just stood around behind the counter chatting while Steph and Mehreen did everything. Everything!    Sept.23.26 8:00 pm"}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest paramount restaurant I have been but the best customer service I had.. everyone are happy and very helpful.. one of the favourite food I had was the their hummus with beef as my appetizer.. They also have amazing manakeesh with chicken.. classic and authentic chicken and beef is my favourite too.. my server Samer was very helpful and fast .. customer service and food amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner for my birthday with a group of 6. The service was very impressive with Ellie as our server.  The service was prompt and efficient. The food was excellent.  Two of us ordered the Fattoush Chicken salad which was delicious and filling! Others had the Mixed Grill Plate which was served with a side of garlic  sauce, Hummus, Pickels roasted Onion and Warm Pita bread for everyone. We left happy and satisfied.  We would all come back to this location."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great restaurant.  The good: Tasty food for good prices. Unlike other Paramount locations, they actually prepare the entire menu (all locations have the same menu, but some locations don't mention that their menu is limited). The food was actually more flavourful than at other Paramount locations (I've now eaten at three). The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't expensive. Worth what you get.  The service was great, always refilling water glasses and the food came out quickly. The counter service makes everything more efficient. They are always forgiving and attentive to our (sometimes cranky) toddler.   The restaurant itself is bright, clean and has a small play area for kids.   Parking lot in the back.  The so so: They don't modify orders, which can be tough with a munchkin to feed/please."}
{"text":"The service at the Mavis location of Paramount Fine Foods restaurant is very friendly. Sammy and staff are very helpful and are readily available to advise on menu items. The mains are made to order so do anticipate to wait a bit. The meals always taste fresh and delicious, not to mention healthy! There are also new menu items which I cannot wait to try such as the grilled shrimp!! I'd like to add that this location always looks very clean. If you have a sweet tooth the desserts are hard to ignore!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I was really looking forward to a meal here and this was just disappointing. Food was super lacking in flavour, temperature and portion. The restaurant itself is so inviting and beautiful, but as they say looks can be deceiving. :( Won't order again. Wouldn't recommend it either."}
{"text":"What a deal! I came by on a Friday night around 6:30 p.m. with a few friends, and I would highly recommend it for not only great prices (my bill came to less than $10 for both a shared appetizer and a main), but also delicious food!   Although our server did not check up on us (it seemed to have been a rather busy night for him), he was very kind and sincerely apologized for not attending to us. The service we did receive was nonetheless fantastic!   APPETIZER: Hummus + Moutabbal + Tabbouleh with Complimentary Pita Bread   The first thing that caught my attention was the poofiness of this bread (see picture)! It was delightfully warm as well. Out of the three dips, I would say my favourite was the moutabbal - it tasted similar to the hummus, but was slightly more liquid as it contained blended grilled eggplant.   MAIN: Spinach with Cheese Manakeesh *RECOMMEND*  Can you imagine a pizza that is lower in calories but with all the flavour? I'd like to introduce you to the Manakeesh!   It was my first time trying this, and it will certainly not be my last! With soft bread and crisp edges, coupled with a generous amount of cheese and clumps of spinach, this dish was filling yet light! I particularly enjoyed the cheese, as it was distinct from the Western cheeses I am more acquainted with (such as cheddar and mozzarella) - rather, the cheese on the Manakeesh had a stronger flavour and was thicker (in a good way!)"}
{"text":"Food is overrated. I find it very bland. The restaurant is very clean. However I find that the food takes longer than expected to be served."}
{"text":"The food here is good. However, I find the shawarma to be a little dry. The falafel is tasty however and The staff are nice."}
{"text":"The place is an operational disaster. Person busking tables is running around and also managing cash where you order.   Waiting for food, they forgot about our sandwiches and left them on the grill.   Impossible to find a server, everyone running around in a frenzy doing their best to avoid eye contact.   For positive, the fresh bread is warm and fluffy.   Finally, also never a fan of restaurants that have a menu with no prices and when you pay you don't see what they are punching in. Just a random number.   Overall unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Unusually bland, poor consistency of service and quality of food. Food wasn't terrible but not enjoyable by any means; it lacked the profound flavours you come to expect from this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"After walking from Houstons for dinner to our hotel, we passed by this place and made it a point to try before we left Toronto. The food here is so fresh and authentic. There are so many kebabs and pizza's that you can order. I wish I had room for their desserts.   The one thing that I do like that I've noticed that a lot of the Toronto restaurants do, including this one, is that they have those mobile Credit Card machines that they walk around with, so that I means I can see my CC as they swipe it. That gives me some comfort."}
{"text":"Avoid!!! Worst customer experience ever!!! The quality of this place went really down and the portions as well.. The only thing that is going up is the prices!!!  Trust from a Lebanese guy who knows how Lebanese food should taste, avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"As a Lebanese guy, I am so disappointed at how Paramount has become!!!  I think that the too many franchises and the GREED made it one of the worst restaurants!! Not only their sandwiches are getting smaller and smaller, but their chicken shawarma is basically the chicken leftovers which are burnt and dipped in oil and served in a tiny pita.. And of course the sandwich does not fill up a baby!!!  This was the only good Lebanese restaurant around, but definitely not anymore!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Paramount and their delicious food. Usually. This location sadly is an outlier of the usual high quality you expect from paramount foods. I have been twice and twice I have received poor service and mediocre or worse food. Once the food took forever to arrive and half the orders were incorrect. Others who sat after we ordered received their food first. Even the wait staff admitted if we sent our orders back there was no guarantee we'd get what we ordered back.  They also admitted they were so backed up that they honestly weren't in any position to fulfill our orders. It was a mess. The second time they only had one CC machine which meant we had to have one person pay and then we had to figure the bill out among ourselves afterwards. Not necessarily hard but very annoying.  (And the service was still slow. Took forever to get our pita and water)   The food itself was either mediocre or below par (soggy fries, overdone chicken)   I personally wouldn't come back unless my team insisted.  (To be fair, they are much more patient and forgiving than I am and they have dietary restrictions that make Paramount easier than other restaurants sometimes)"}
{"text":"Worst shawarma place to eat. Ever. The chicken was more like very dry and it was more like scraps. They try to over emphasize with the naan but who needs round naans? Rice was plain af. Salad was nothing to remember.the jalebi and other desserts was stale and gross. Better to eat at tandoori flame or osmos"}
{"text":"great casual dining place, very reasonably priced good food"}
{"text":"Efficient and Nice staff. By far, one of the best restaurants I have been to in Toronto since I got here 8 months ago. The menu has so many options, for all sorts of taste. The size of the meal is gianormous and the price is very fair. Totally recommend the place."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food I have tried in Toronto! I tried both manakeesh and saj and both were perfect!"}
{"text":"This area has lots of outstanding sharwama places,  my standard of sharwama has been a bit high, i packed Chicken sharwama here for lunch, not impressed.  Let me just say, portion and taste do not match with price. I don't go heavy on salt, but this is really plain without pickle.  I'll just have to go back to wherever I headed to the most. No more \"Fine food\" and more street food pls."}
{"text":"I have tried the beef shawarma, tabouleh, humus, kibbeh, kafta sandwich etc...everything is perfect.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ate at Paramount during TIFF, it's really close to the Winter Garden/Visa Screening Room.  I stopped there for an in between film meal and ordered the falafel as appetizer and a feta cheese salad with chicken.  Quick friendly service and reasonably priced.  The falafel tasted almost like a muffin and melts in your mouth, I have never eaten any falafel like it!  The salad was good too, but nothing spectacular.    I would try it again the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Met up with my girls for a quick get together for dinner.    The food was ok, nothing too exciting.  I ordered the shawarma plate and hummus.  The hummus was good, but my shawarma lacked in flavour even with the garlic sauce and hot sauce.  The hot sauce wasn't hot at all.  The bread was always warm and fresh...if your bread got cold, they would take it back and give you a fresh one.  The staff were very pleasant and friendly...checked in on us and just always smiling.    I think this location would do better with restaurant service where someone takes your order and you get your bill after.  But it's almost like a fast food chain where you order and pay for your food then sit.  Then when your food is done, they bring it to your table.  This wasn't the best middle eastern food I've had, so I'm not 100% sure if I would go here again."}
{"text":"wow just wow. definitely one of the better Paramount locations, everything is clean & the servers are very attentive. If you have a chance, get the Fattoush Salad! One of the best fresh salads i've had before, the garlic sauce stood out the most."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of middle eastern food, my hubby likes it though so we went there for dinner.  Interior is nice.  And service is great.  Food is good and reasonably priced.  And they even have a very small indoor playground.  Will probably return."}
{"text":"They are cutting quality and charging a lot. This Paramount needs to improve or close."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was poor, it was very crowded. The overall experience was decent but not the greatest. May go back if its not busy."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before going here, but I only decided to read them since i had so much time waiting for my takeout. It took 17 mins to prepare a 7\" chicken shawarma wrap, fries and a tabouleh salad. I paid 50 cents more for hot sauce which they never gave me. The hot sauce would have been helpful since all the food was so dry.  There were more workers than tables occupied when I was there. I had a lot of time to count.  The 1 star is for the extra highh quality napkins they put in my bag."}
{"text":"I'm hella pleased that Paramount is in the Dundas square area. Middle eastern food is so delicious and satisfying! This is a very good option compared to the terrible or boring places that surround it (e.g. Hard Rock Cafe, Burger King, Milestones, etc). They are a busy operation, especially around lunchtime and the service is good- an adaptable blend of friendly and efficient.   There are practical, thoughful touches like serving your generous helping of hummus in a container and lid so that you can easily take home the leftovers or offering whole wheat pita bread.  NOTE: I tend to avoid or go light on the meats, sandwiches, and fries   Some of my favourite basic items to order:  Hummus $5.49 Chick peas, tahini sauce & virgin olive oil.  -A creamy, tahini-heavy hummus. You will definitely be able to share this with a few people or if it's only you and another person, you will have a leftovers. I like to sometimes have this as my meal and may order a side salad or a few grape leaves as well. I have also ordered the hummus with chicken before (Hummus with Chicken or Beef $8.49 -Hummus with your choice of beef or chicken shawarma drizzled with olive oil) and of course it's incredibly filling and you will have leftovers and a few portions of this high protein dish to share or take home   Grape Leaves $5.99 Vine leaves stuffed with rice, tomato, parsley and fresh mint.  -Just delicious. It also tastes like it's spiced with a bit of cinnamon or something.  Fattoush Salad $5.49 Romaine lettuce, cucumber, green peppers, tomatoes, red radishes and fried pita pieces tossed in a Mediterranean dressing.  -A more exciting version of your typical side salad  Manakeesh (arabic style pizza)   Zaatar $2.49 Thyme & Sesame mixed with virgin olive oil    Cheese with Zaatar $3.99 Melted Accawi cheese with Zaatar (Thyme & Sesame mixed with virgin olive oil)  -So cheap, so huge, JUST YUM.  Zaatar makes everything amazing!!!  The desserts and sweets are beautiful to look at and they taste as good as they look... baklawa, kanafeh (an arabic cheese pastry soaked in sweet syrup) etc... I have never had room after a meal, but have eaten some of their sweets in other work contexts and I'm very into it."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a Paramount addict. I am not ashamed to say it.  I probably come here 2-3 times a week. And how can I not?  I strictly go to the one in north york (yonge and clarke) and they just recently renovated the whole place!! It looks SO much better, less of that cafeteria feel. I truly feel at home here, and I'm not even middle eastern. The people are always nice, and they always remember your name (even my order sometimes).   The pitas are divine, they're so puffy and warm. I suggest getting the hummus or lebneh (yoghurt dip, it's not on the menu but ask them anyways.)The manakesh are really good, I usually get the cheese and chicken one.  As for mains, I usually go with the shish taouk skewers, aka chicken skewers. I could get the plate, but that's too big of a portion for me. The chicken is cooked to perfection. If you want bang for your buck get the mixed plate, you'll get a selection of meats with rice/fries. I suggest having a LAZIZA with your meal, which is an non-alcoholic apple beer, it's really refreshing. Or a capuccino, i have one everytime and it's great.   There is a great selection of desserts and cookies. The mini baklava pieces are really good! You can't have just one."}
{"text":"Very yummy shwarmas  Big restaurant and therefore wait list moves fast Very tasty"}
{"text":"Ordered off the justeat app, amazing service. They accidentally gave us the wrong order, called, and redelivered the correct food quickly (within 15 minutes) while letting us keep what we got as a mistake.  Would highly recommend the hummus, it's very light and I order it every time I go! Their Greek salad is also light and delicious, overall 5/5 service and food."}
{"text":"I really have mixed reviews. Sometimes the chicken is really dry. Sometimes it's juicy. The Shish Tawook I had today was yummy. The chicken shawarma not so much. The beef Saj was too dry. Chicken Saj has mostly been good except once where I threw up. The Zaatar is delicious. Fatoosh is also yummy and fresh. Great place for families and kids. Also it's halal so that makes me happy."}
{"text":"So I dont get the big deal with this place.  I expected it to be really good but its just okayy.  The only thing that stands out about this place is the pita they give you.  It's super soft and the inside is SO fluffy and beautiful haha but it's pretty tasteless if you don't have any dip for it.    I had the chicken shawarma plate for dinner.  The plate was huge and you def walk away full.  The mixed pickles it came with were gross in my opinion.  The chicken is seasoned really well and is served on top of a pita, but this one sucks in comparison to the soft one they give you in the beginning.  It also comes with a garlic dip.  I personally thought this was gross but to each their own.  Don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a friend. The take out line was long so we decided to just sit and dine inside the restaurant. It took forever for someone to take our orders and for our food to come. The food itself was mediocre. There were barely any servers/waitresses in sight so we had a hard time getting someone's attention when we needed things. I was annoyed that we had to spend such a long time in that restaurant because that time could have been spent actually shopping in the mall."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're a family of ants. Barely enough meat inside to assemble into a chicken wing.  Lettuce was semi-fresh I guess."}
{"text":"Paramount is okay. Bear in mind that they're trying to have mass appeal, so their flavours are generally milder than real Lebanese food. Many people like Paramount for that reason however, and it's a safe choice for groups - moreover this location is nicely decorated. They use fairly good ingredients too, so the food is still enjoyable, albeit unspectacular."}
{"text":"I was kind of confused about the dining procedure.  this place looks like a typical dine in restaurant but come off as a well decorated fast food type restaurant. We were shown to our seats, but the actual ordering of food and paying needs to happen before the food is served; which left us to question what to do about tip, which we left on the table when finished.   The fast-food feel did become more apparent when I wanted to order extra sauce in between dinner, had to pay in advance, then continue eating dinner.    The food was okay.  Falafels were larger than I've ever had and tasted good.  Appetizer maza was quite tasty.  Meat dishes were kind of dry.  Very good portion size based on prices."}
{"text":"The ambiance is family-friendly, well-lit, and semi-casual.   I loved their hummus and the blown up pitas they give to snack on the hummus. Our family of six, had two pizzas which were okay. They are made on naan/ pita, and I wasn't too fond of that. However, our mixed family platter was great. It had well-season meats and a lot of variety. The kabobs and shish taouk were my favorite.  Their food is quite decent and flavorful and I like the décor, and large spacious-ness inside, but there are some Middle-Eastern places out there that have a little better taste in terms of their seasonings and the way they are served i.e. on a bed of seasoned rice and stuff, but I was still satisfied.   The price is reasonable but other places offer better prices for the same food. But considering it's nice and spacious and trendy from inside, it makes sense that the price is a little higher.    Staff is very attentive and friendly. They checked on us a couple of times."}
{"text":"Go here.  Its one of the best choices in the neighbourhood, especially when balancing price-quantity-quality.  Great seating area upstairs.  You can easily feed 2 people and come home with left overs for under $30.    What can I say the place is great... not the best... but definitely great."}
{"text":"In all honestly, this is probably my fault.  I ordered a tabbouleh salad and once I realised that the staff member couldn't even find it and spent minutes finding someone to help him locate it, I should have walked away from ordering it.  Service was extremely slow and inefficient, the portion size was small, and it was very mediocre.  If you enjoy eating gritty little bits in your $9 dollar small sized salad, you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Called to add garlic sauce  that they give away for free in the restaurant for my food delivery and they said it's extra charge, and insisted there's an option to add it in the order but it's a non existing option in the menu. Incompetent guy said there is. I guess I was delusional. Check back and there's isn't at all. Told him I would have ordered it if it was there. I told him to charge me extra if they want too but the smart ass guy said he can't do it, why even tell me it's extra charge if you can't do it stupid. Get your information and shit together. Yeah for a garlic sauce I'll be stingy about it because I never had problems  from them giving me that sauce when I dine and take outs, so delivery I guess they are being jerks? Never again with this location, I'd rather go to yorkville and have them do my deliveries coz they are more friendly and competent."}
{"text":"Location: 1290 Crestlawn Drive (Mississauga, ON L4W 1A6) Price: $$ Service: Alright  This is a chained restaurant around the GTA. I've heard a lot of good things about this chain but specially this one in Mississauga. I don't know if this one specifically is the first restaurant chain- but the food was great. The location was a little weird because it is right in the middle of an industrial area- regardless it was a gem. They also have a patio.  It was a little confusing on how to order the food. It is a sit down restaurant, but you'd have to go and order your food and then they will bring it to your table. You also do not pay when you order your food; you pay at the very end. As for food, I was not too hungry that day, so I just ordered a Chicken Shawarma Sandwich. The shawarma was massive- thank god I didn't get it as a whole meal. I went with a big group and everyone ordered different things and we shared. The meal patters were big enough to feed about three people- no lie. One of the things on the menu that I do recommend ordering is the Char-Grilled BBQ Chicken. It was delicious and the dipping sauce that came along with it was just heaven. They also give you this plate of pita with a mixture of sesame seed and some type of light sauce on top as an appetizer- for me personally it was a little bitter because of the sauce that came with it. It is just my personal taste but my friends did enjoy the pita a lot.   The service was alright; maybe because they were so busy they didn't come and check regularly. But other than that the trip was great.  Verdict: Food was great."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small and inexpensive, but the falafel wrap and shawarma wraps are delicious. They're as good as anything in the Middle East. The food is fresh and perfectly cooked, and the service is fast and friendly. Go, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good variety of delicious middle eastern food. I noticed alot of vegetarian and vegan options.   I got the hummus and the Zatar with cheese. The tastes are definitely unique and super flavored. The Zatar cheese was so yummy, similar to cottage cheese. It came in the perfect filling size, around the size of a small pizza.  The hummus was perfect. Best appetizer with th bread.   For dessert we got the Kinafe, which they say is similar to a cheese Danish. I agree but it's a bit less sweet then a cheese Danish and a bit more moist.   It was kinda weird how it was set up. Once you get seated and ready to order you have to go to the cashier to order. It was kind of confusing at first."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time getting food from this location and let me tell you it is very different than other Paramount locations. I am extremely disappointed at their customer service, food and pace.   Customer Service: The sales associates they have working there are really awkward, they just stare and some seem like they have no mannerisms.   Today, the cashier forgot to charge me for chicken.. the manager came back and made him charge me $1.00 on my debit after i was about to leave to pay for the chicken. Where is the customer service in all of this? YOU forgot, I left and you had me come back :S What?!  Food: I got the fatoush salad about 3 times since opening, today they forgot the pita chips AND the dressing. How the eff, do you forget the pita chips? Thats the main part of the salad. On top of that they serve the salad in a shallow plate - not even a bowl - literally 10 bites.   Pace:  They are not trained to work fast. When there is a rush hour, they work very slowly. After 1 PM - all 10 of them are just standing around in the serving area. Management needs to better schedule their associates so there isn't an overabundance of people standing around after rush hours.   Overall, this Paramount doesnt compare to other Paramounts. Either step up your game or bring on another eatery. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Terrible portions. So expensive for what you get. I thought a $7 garden salad would be enough food for a meal. I added chicken afterwards as the amount of salad is laughable. I should have learned my lesson as the chicken portion for $5 is less than a chicken breast. I will not be going back. Not worth the money at all. So many other better options in the area."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst food I have ever had in my life. I was so mad because I'm not from Etobicoke, I was in the area and my brother bought me this chicken and rice plate that was absolutely horrid. I'm so mad I couldn't go back and cuss them off about this in person. I was so mad, I literally threw this disgusting a** food on the floor, waste of 15 bucks.  The takeout plate I got was completely cold to start off. There was 2 little itty pieces of chicken in the plate, the bread that came with it was completely burnt at the bottom...smh I don't know what kind of pathetic people give take out food THIS bad. If you read my previous reviews you'll see I'll never rant like this, but this place just got me so mad. Never again would I come here. If ZERO STARS was an option, I would 100% give that. Learn how to cook or shut down your location"}
{"text":"By far the WORST chicken shawarma plate I have ever had. Such a disappointment. The salad was sparse. It was mostly all some kind of white cheese which didn't taste like feta or goat. The chicken itself was hard and dry. It was also greasy as tho it came off a frying pan- which was odd cause it was dry. The Tabouleh was sweet and tasted like there was added sugar to the lemon juice which was just grosss. And the pita was the worst most bland pita I ever tried. Avoid this place at all costs as it's truly a gross rip off.    SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to a REAL SHAWARMA place."}
{"text":"I love Paramount! I'm so glad they are in Yorkville now. The new restaurant is beautiful and the staff is always very friendly. They always seem to manage even when it's very busy. I always come back - the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade the review a little bit. It's still a pretty good place, and since it's close to work I'm sure I'll be back again - but most return visits haven't matched my first.  At one or two visits, the meat and rice wasn't quite as fresh. Other times it has been on the mark, but I've experienced inconsistency. Today was my first negative experience, with the takeout grape leaves clearly having been in the fridge too long. They were limp, tasteless and way too cold to the point of hurting my teeth.  I've still had mostly positive experiences, and there are still many qualities; but I now think of this place as solid rather than great."}
{"text":"Finding the perfect Arabic food is not easy. Paramount has delicious menu for that. Their grilled platter Is really good. Also try the hummus and arais. The chicken shawarma seemed a bit salty but was delicious. Over all would rate the experience fantastic."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for take out that I received on my way home. I was very disappointed as I had asked for Kefta and Salad. I asked for extra pickles, turnips, hummus and tahini. When I got home I wasn't given any of what I asked for. It was a plain salad, a HUGE serving of plain rice and very average Kefta. I was super disappointed as I've eaten at the Yorkdale location and it was divine."}
{"text":"True to style middle eastern food- go for the ground meat skewers rather than the solid cuts of beef (they can be tough and dry).  This is my go to place when I want the closest approximation of real Middle Eastern style food.  they have griled meats, puffed pita, eggplant dip true to style-  they hummous needs more garlic, the pickled veggies are not \"authentic\" but good. But most of all they off knafe/ kinaffe, kenafe (however it's spelled)- a dessert that's almost impossible to find, apparently.  white cheese, with a crispy top drowned in syrup.  The smoothies are intense and definitely enough to share. Some people have complained about the fries- underdone..a little limp etc.  What I learned from travelling and eating a lot abroad is that these are true to style.  It's actually only a North American thing that fries are deep fried like crazy and crispy on the outside.  Other places don't do the soak, double deep fry, etc treatment.  they just fry that shiz and send it to the table- so they are a little lacklustre, true."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night with 20 people with reservation. They had apple space for more people. Food came relatively quickly. Service was great. The manager even came and advised me on what to get. We got the family bbq platter and manakeesh. Everything was delicious and food was plentiful."}
{"text":"I came to eat here Saturday afternoon. Restaurant wasn't busy but the service was bad. I had to ask 2 servers to get a refill on water, they spend a lot of time chatting to each other or simply doing something else besides serving customers.   Food wasn't worth the price. Mixed grill platter was around $24? The 4 skewers of meat were small and so dry, not even hot. Lukewarm at best, seems like it was cooked before and just re-warmed. Not fresh. So dry it was hard to swallow!   They get 2 stars for the appetizer mezza plate, I enjoyed the dips and the free fresh pita bread. They need to work on their service and main courses."}
{"text":"Quick lunch with my friend. First time at this place. Very clean quick service. Staff was a little confused since they were on training, which is understandable.  Ordered hummus, lamb and chicken shawarma.  Good large dining space. Good location and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy.   For lunch, this location is packed like a mall on Christmas eve, especially considering the location is fairly tucked away.   With this amount of turnover, the food is fresh and pretty good.  I wouldn't say the meat is substantially better than other schwarma places in the area, such as Pita & Grill, nothing that blows me away.  The portions of the sandwich are also pretty small.  The best thing is probably the pita bread, which is really fresh and is all puffy and steaming when it gets to your table.   The hummus is creamier than most other places.  Garlic sauce is alright, but I think the one at Pita & Grill up the street is better.  I think this place is a bit overpriced, ($11 + tax for a chicken schwarma plate, I've uploaded a pic of their price list) for what you get compared to other schwarma places.   Overall, the place is good. I don't mind going, but I do think the rating on Yelp is a bit high for the quality and price of food, but that's just my opinion, to each his own :)"}
{"text":"Good fatoush salad, good falafel sandwich.  Really nice fresh giant pita bread for your hummus.  Finally a good middle eastern restaurant!  Nice variety on the menu that has a lot of authentic middle eastern food.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They have good food that is totally bland without any salt or spices (perhaps, a wrong choice for a girl that prefers spices, flavor,  and aroma like Pakistani  cuisine). Stuff is over priced and over hyped. Staff is rude in general. The service is extremely slow. On top of that, families with loads of kids who are running around in aisles between tables and screaming,  adults talking to each other as if another person is sitting across the border.... just too much to take. This place is extremely noisy,  tight, over crowded,  with loud people and loud music. Just too much distraction going on that you can't even enjoy your expensive food."}
{"text":"I've ordered in and eaten there.  I find that there aren't really enough (healthy) vegetarian choices - something they need to improve on.  And I'm not even vegetarian!  Would have loved to see veggie skewers and that sort.  But I guess they're not that type of restaurant.  I also think they love giving away pita.  With many people cutting down on their carbs, it's probably best to ask if people want bread!"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING. This location becomes worse every time I come here. Fattoush salad was barely dressed and a half of an usual portion. Also ordered pizza, which came in 35 min COLD! It was Monday, and the place wasn't super busy."}
{"text":"I usually get the chicken shawarma here. They freshly grill their chicken and their ingredients look fresh as well. The service is great here, I have not had any problems with any wrong orders or slow service. Only lunch hour yields a long line. The pickled radish and the pickled cucumbers are not my favourite so I like to omit them. The garlic and hot sauce are delicious as well! It's a well worth lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here after work last week since it's close to home and because MR loves Mediterranean food. I'm not too crazy about the type of spices in the meat so I ordered the \"yella fries\". Not bad! But I'm biased because I love anything that has garlic.... Fries, shawarma, and their garlic sauce= better than the poutine (in my opinion) because the fries stay crispy. Stay away if you don't love garlic because the smell and taste will linger for hours after your meal."}
{"text":"Having just finished up a meeting, we went to this location for a quick lunch.   For those who haven't been, this was a little bit different. You have to order at a counter, a waiter doesn't take your order. If I had known that going in, then I would have sat there like an idiot waiting for the waiter to take our order. My co-worker laughed it off and off I went to place our order.   I ordered the salad with a side of the lamb skewer. She ordered the chicken wrap. (keep in mind that they were different names, I just don't remember what the names were).   Overall, the food was pretty good. The wrap, I was told, was fantastic. She said that she would love to go back again. My salad, was ok, but how do you fail a salad? forget the lettuce? The problem I had was that they served the skewer to me after I finished the salad. That didn't make sense to me, and the meat was a little bit overcooked.   The desserts were amazing. I ordered the rings and the diamonds (I think it is like a mini baklava) and they were delicious. Bought some for everyone at the office and they were flying out of the box. I was disappointed as I only ate one piece.... not impressed with the office staff right now.   Pros  Great Dessert Good food Not really any service  Cons  Meat came after the salad Looked stupid waiting for the waiter to take our order...will look cool next time i guess."}
{"text":"Good food, but I would have liked a wider selection of healthier vegetarian options.  And perhaps fish as well."}
{"text":"I have tried an assortment of items. Usually when i go with large groups we get the platters. Tons of meat. However when i go by myself . Shish tawook is a must. Succulant white breast chicken skewers.My favourite thing to start with is the spicy chicken pizza (manakeesh). Absolutely delicious. Love the cheesy dessert (Kinafa) ...feel like im going to have a heart attack from all the sugar..but cheese so gooey and yummy ."}
{"text":"Crowded  . Bad air conditioning . We ordeded comb platter and Lamb bbq . Lamb meat had too much gamey taste and smell ."}
{"text":"As a shwarma and tabouli lover, I am very picky about them. Great place. Long display cabinets show you all of the lovely food that you can order.  I got a chicken shwarma with nothing picked at all, lettuce, garlic sauce, hummus, tahini, onions. Also a side of tabouli. I asked that my chicken be extra crispy. It wasn't.   The tabouli was FABULOUS. They sure know how to do it right. If anything, I wish the portion was bigger. Also, they had to take the tabouli from the side order that I had out to put on my shwarma sandwich.  The baklava was great as well."}
{"text":"Garbage rude service. This is no where close to authentic arabic food. Its just a mediocre franchise."}
{"text":"Had a Halloween party on Saturday night so didn't have time to write a review until today.   Since we had a party, I was thinking of bringing some desserts. I know that the kids were going to have a lot of junk, but I personally hate that crap, so thought I would bring better food. Boy did I regret that.   We wanted to bring some of those bite size desserts. I don' t know what they were called off the top of my head, but they are very good. The food quality there is quite good, and I usually frequent their other location in Scarborough. As the party was in this area, I decided to stop by this location to get the food.   Now, keep in mind that this is a take out order so I can't really comment on the dine-in service. But the take out service was TERRIBLE. I was there for over 45 minutes waiting to get served. The dessert counter usually has its own staff, but this time around, it was completely empty. I went to the food ordering counter to ask if this location did things differently. They said no and asked me to walk back there and someone would be with me shortly. After 15 minutes, I went back and asked again. Again, they said someone would be there shortly to help me. Being the idiot that I was, I went back and just stood there again waiting. At this time, there was a line building and each time I left the line, I would come back and start at the end of the line.......worst experience ever.   Once I actually got my order, I went to pay, No one was there and the gentleman asked me to walk to the other side of the restaurant to pay for my order....back in line I went to pay for it. When I turned around, he was at the cash helping someone else. I guess he just didn't want to help me with my order.   Service here was terrible. I'm not sure if it was because it was Halloween or what not, but I will never go back again.   On the plus side, the food was still good."}
{"text":"I'm surprised about all of the bad reviews for this place. I tried the small build your own box for lunch today with a deal from ritual ($6.50 taxes in) and was quite pleased with the flavor of the box. The portion was filling, but maybe that is because I opted for rice, and I could see the small container not holding much salad for if I chose that. Good lunch option in the area."}
{"text":"I was there early at Yorkdale to pick up my moms new phone and do a few things as well. We were both hungry and went up to the food court. We originally were looking for Tim Horton's but came across this place instead. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. Plus thing is if you are really hungry there's two sizes available. You can do the small or large depending on how hungry you are. I went with the small which was really filling, the shawarma tasted amazing! I haven't had that good of a shawarma in a very long time. They do put like chips in a sense in your shawarma which make the wrap taste even better. The employees are very friendly, with great customer service. The line wasn't too long, but was moving quickly. I would definitely come back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"So I was stupid enough to order from here again.this Time after I placed my order, I called the store to make sure they got everything correct. After I got my order which again I payed just under 70 bucks for, ONE OF THE MAIN ENTREES I ORDERED WASNT THERE. I called and spoke to the \"owner\" who first told me I could come drive there and pick it up. I told the wonder that to drive there and pick it up would be absurd, as the entire REASON I payed extra for delivery was that I was working late and could not leave. Then the wonder told me to call UBEREATS and said it was the fault of UBEREATS.Then the owner said he would maybe drive the food over to me, but then he said that THE KITCHEN WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. He told me that the next day I could call and he would deliver the one item. It meant one of the people that was with me had to share an entree and we were both still hungry. I don't need to get fooled more than once to know that this place is a fucking mess and can't even complete a simple order. The food is inconsistent and not even good. It's also heavily overpriced. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Paramount!  Pros: + fluffy pita bread the size of your head + best moutabbal (eggplant dip) ever, for dipping the aforementioned head pita + great option in a desolate part of town for restaurants, unless your favourite cuisine comes from the Hard Rock Cafe or Eaton Centre food court  Cons: - always crowded - slow to be served, especially considering much of the menu (e.g. juices, dips) is made-ahead and desperately waiting to get in my mouth - rushed if not rude service (we once had an older waitress so surly and impatient that she straight up snapped at us when we asked for a recommendation)  Despite the fact that I regularly wait 10-15 minutes after sitting down just for some water, I can't quit the cheese and za'atar manakeesh. It is the apex of \"ethnic pizzas\" I've tried. On occasion I've ordered the other veggie varieties in an attempt to get some greens (between the head pita and the pizzas, it's a lot of bread) but clearly the C&Z is the MVP.  Note to Paramount: I understand the convenience for to-go orders, but I do wish you would serve your delicious dips for sit-down diners in normal bowls instead of the wasteful plastic takeout containers. Hopefully you'll take the feedback and go green."}
{"text":"The experience started with a confused approach to dining. No official wait staff to take your order, even though they have more than enough staff to do so. Odd, but we managed to navigate the menu as we are experienced diners. Our order consisted of fatoush and taboule salads, houmos and fresh bread, falafel balls, kebbe balls, Yallah fries and a couple of skewers of chicken shish tawook.  The bread was fresh baked, but bland. The fatoush was as if the dressing was watered down and the lettuce was iceberg. The taboule was alright, but not great. The falafel was overly spiced with what I believe was cumin. Not delicate at all. My wife could not eat it at all. The kebbe was alright but not great. The yallah fries really wasn't anything more than fries topped with shawarma and loads of tahini and garlic sauce. Mediocre. The skewers of chicken was served before anything else came to the table aside from the bread. How does one grill chicken that quickly?  It must be pre-cooked.   I asked for a refund on the fatoush, but I wish I asked for more. They did the refund apologetically and offered a mini box of baklava.   Overall our experience was poor. I wouldn't return again to eat. Especially when there are a number of amazing middle eastern restaurants in the immediate area. Consider an alternative to this restaurant if you are looking for a great meal as well as great service."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken/beef platter with potatoes and a saj wrap.   The quality of the meat is very low...literally chopped up small bits of chicken and beef to make it seem like it's a lot.  The beef was very dry...I don't think I'll be going here again"}
{"text":"I have eaten dine-in in another paramount and had lamb and it was good.  But.. This place, After take out lamb plate with 1 extra skewer, half of the lamb was burned and pieces were half the size of regular.   No hummus was in the box.  Fries were crapy.  They give 2 big bread. Why I need those when food portion is small and not up to standard. What do they think, people will eat only bread after paying this high price?"}
{"text":"The Yalla Special was a sort of Lebanese poutine where there are fries topped with chicken sharwarma, garlic sauce, and tahini sauce.  It was a large portion and definitely something you want to share with a friend or two!  I loved the garlic and tahini sauce and how thick and creamy it was.  The chunks of chicken sharwarma within the fries made this dish very filling too.  The BBQ Chicken Wings were three pieces of whole marinated BBQ wings.  Now these might seem like normal BBQ wings to you, but these chicken wings were so tender and juicy.  I really liked how the meat was so tender and the marination was just right.  It also came with a small serving of sauce that I really liked."}
{"text":"The Paramount Special consisted of layers of fresh strawberry and mango juices and mixed fruits, topped with fresh strawberry, kiwi, pineapple, almonds, crushed pistachio, ashta cream, and honey.  This was a beautiful drink of so many colours and fresh fruits!  It tasted sweet and rich!  The Jellab drink caught my eye on the drink and I decided to try it.  This was an authentic, refreshingly sweet Middle Eastern drink with the flavour of fruit, rose water, and dates.  I'm really glad I ordered this because this was a gem!  It doesn't look all that amazing compared to the flashier fruit drinks but this was incredibly refreshing and simple.  It reminded me of a Middle Eastern version of those sweet-tasting Chinese herb drinks.  It was a great start to our meal!  The Shawarma Poutine arrived first. This was as appetizing and delightful as the menu described it to be.  It was a huge portion and definitely shareable. It was a delicious indeed! What I loved particularly about it was that the gravy was rich and flavourful (the only way gravy should be on any poutine), there were some significant melted cheese curds (so important for poutine), lots of fries, and lots of good shawarma meat.  The Grape Leaves were an appetizer of vine leaves stuffed with rice, tomatoes, parsley, and fresh mint.  I've always been fond of grape leaves and found this appetizer to be substantial.  I thought this was so well-made and tasty!  It had the perfect taste of sourness to it too to open up our appetites even more.  The Spinach with Cheese Manakeesh turned out to be a bigger portion than I expected It smelled amazing and it was definitely edible like a pizza.  I used my hands to eat it (is that the right way to eat it?). It had spinach mixed with onions, sumac, and was topped with melted Accawi cheese.  It was delicious!  I liked that it wasn't too heavy.  The onions and sumac (fruit of a shrub) gave the Manakeesh a lemony flavour that also helped to open up the appetizer for heavier food.  Ordering the Mixed Grill Platter was a smart idea to be able to try a combination of their meats all in one place!  It included a grilled skewer of striploin beef, skewer of shish tawouk, two skewers of kafta served with grilled tomatoes, onions, a piece of spicy bread, and a side of hummus and garlic sauce.  I was really impressed with this Mixed Grill Platter. Everything from the tender and very flavourful striploin beef and shish tawouk to the well-seasoned kafta to the freshly grilled tomatoes to the most delicious hummus and best garlic sauce (that had a bit of a kick to it).  The hot pita was also available on our table to go with the mixed grill platter.  The rice was also a good pairing with all the meats and salad!  The pistachio and nut baklava were actually all really tasty.  I liked that they were just bite-sized and not overly sweet at all.  It was the perfect finish to a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Went to an event that was catered by paramount and I thought it was pretty delicious! We had spicey chicken, potatoes, salad, beef kafta, and falafels. There was a garlic sauce also that is every garlic lovers dream! We also had their baklava which was very sweet and didn't have a dominant nut flavour, but it was still good."}
{"text":"Visited this place lunch time which wasn't busy at all...ordered lamb platter...had to wait 45 minuets for it. Service wasn't acceptable at all and excruciatingly slow. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday for early lunch. The place looks nice and modern. When we entered, someone promptly greeted us at the door and ushered us to a table. The menu is pretty extensive. I had a chicken shawarma sandwich and the moutabal. Both were good. The portion size of the shawarma sandwich is just enough for me. Not too big. My husband had sujuk (spicy sausage) platter and it was really good. It had a mild heat to it. Not too spicy at all.   We went with our 13-month old daughter so we could not stay long. It was more of an \"eat and run\" type of meal. We still enjoyed it though. I would like to go back and try their other offerings.   Please note that they'll give the menu at your table but you order and pay at the counter.  I would also like to add that we've tried their baklavas on a separate occasion (my husband did a takeout previously). They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent and healthy food. Served quickly, with friendly wait staff. Can be too busy at times though."}
{"text":"Paramount restaurant on Yonge Street, south of Dundas = really bad Middle Eastern food.  This is supposed to be a Lebanese operation, but their food is sloppy, overcooked, and overpriced.  Had the lamb takeout with fries.  The lamb was flavorless and tough, and the pickled stuff they usually include with Middle Eastern dishes was rancid!  So for overcooked lamb, sub-par fries, and rancid sides, it cost me $15.99 + tax.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I'd like this to be a three and a half star review.  I was here with my vegetarian daughter the other day.  This is the former Applebees location.  There was lots of parking, but at least three double-parked cars, and two of those were double-parked, eating up premium parking spots near the restaurant doors.  We were greeted right away and seated immediately.  As part of all meals we were served two freshly baked pitas.  These definitely lived up to the standard put forth by the other locations.  The thing that always throws me through a loop here is that you have to go and place your order ahead and pay then they bring it to you.  Are you supposed to tip in these situations, or is it a lesser tip as if this were a buffet restaurant?  In our case our server brought us our glasses of water, but never came back to offer a refill.  She had the lentil soup, and the Mujadara - so she was on a lentil kick for the day.  She said it was good, and brought some of the Mujadara home.  I had the beef shwarma wrap.  The food was good.  For me despite the appearance, cleanliness of the restaurants there is something missing.  The restaurant lacks a certain atmosphere.  I like the food, we will be back.  Its just the atmosphere is missing a certain amount of vitality, or livlieness.  On food alone this would be a four, but the atmosphere pulls it down."}
{"text":"I drove by the patio the other day and the faces of the customers made me think this place was worth a try.   I'm glad I decided to check this place out.   The food is fantastic and the service very friendly.    Paramount has a interesting set-up that I haven't encountered in North America before.  You go in and order, almost cafeteria style and then they deliver your food to your table.    I had the Chicken Shawarma plate and some Baklava for a post lunch treat.  Both were excellent.   I'd highly recommend this place for a quick, affordable and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"This new location does not live up to the hype... Not like the Dundas location Ambiance 4.5/5 Beautiful renovations Poor service 2/5 got my order wrong after clarifying twice, was told I'd get \"whatever side they had\"  Food: 1.5/5 Very dry shawarma meat (favour wasn't bad). Small portions. Limp salad. Not worth the price"}
{"text":"Good food good service. Yummy menu. Also great for big groups.  Halal menu. T kids love the place."}
{"text":"Been to Paramount for quite some time and before their chain expanded I use to be a huge fan. Unfortunately, now their food just seems mediocre and the prices have gone up while portions have decreased.  This location in particular gets very busy especially during lunch time. Even when placing take out orders you are stuck waiting for quite some time... Try to call ahead if possible (but two times we called ahead they did not do our orders correctly). Usually I would go with the chicken shawarma platter. Comes with a side of rice, very small portion of chicken shawarma, some salad and freshly baked nan. In all honesty, the fresh bake nan really saves their establishment because it is so fluffy and hot when you get it. The hot sauce is an additional charge (so annoying!!) and they are super stingy on the garlic sauce. Their takeout platters are similar to the Swiss chalet take out platter box but the depth of the plate is very short and therefore you don't get very much. Overall the experience is not as great anymore and will probably not return"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I've tried everything in Middle Eastern food, I find Paramount.   Manakeesh is the best ethnic pizza I've ever had. It's relatively healthier and I absolutely love the exotic spicies used on them. They range from $2.49-$5.00. It's a good snack.  Of course, they have things like kebobs, falafel and shawarma. We had the mixed grill. For $18 I get 4 skewers with rice and veggies. Comes with dip (hummus?) and puffy pita bread. Their bread is so good! Mixed grill is a good way to sample their kebobs and the portion is good enough to feed 2 people.   The chicken + beef shawarma plate was delightful. The problem I have with some shawarma places is that their meat is swimming in oil. Paramount's shawarma certainly has oil, but it's light enough that I don't feel disgusted. The taste is perfect! The rice is just as good. I can't stand places that have their rice swimming in oil. Paramount's rice is light and dry.   I will definitely come back. It doesn't get 5 stars becaue I think their prices are slightly high. It's certainly reasonable just a little higher than I'd like. When it comes to middle eastern food, for value, I like Super Khorak much better but SK doesn't have the puffy pita bread and they don't have hummus."}
{"text":"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the food I received at this location.I normally am a fan of Paramount and have been to the locations near my house and the one in Hamilton previously which are both good. Today I ordered takeout around 11:40 am where I was the only person waiting for takeout and only three tables had occupants. I understand that beef takes a while to be cooked properly and the time in which I got my food was not a problem. What was a problem was the food itself. First of all there was no garlic sauce in my takeout container and I was given no pita bread. Second EVERYTHING in that container was old. The lettuce was stale and soggy, the pickles and pickled radishes were dried as if left refrigerated open overnight. The rice was hard, cold and clumping together and the kaftas I got were dry and hard. Nothing was warm and I don't know if I was just thrown leftovers from the night before but I will NOT be returning to this location ever. For 15 dollars I could have spent my money elsewhere and made my lunch break so much more easier. I wish I took a picture before I threw it all in the trash. Would have returned to complain if I didn't have a short lunch break. Giving the 1 star cause its th3 lowest I can give."}
{"text":"Chicken wasn't cooked.  Apart from that major fail, food was ok at best. I took a chk shawarma plate to go. They should give ketchup with fries."}
{"text":"Visited Fri April 28, 2017 Party of 2 for dinner. I don't eat middle eastern food very often, I was really impressed with the food. This restaurant deserves a higher rating, and I will be coming back again!  Pros Amazing service, this place deserves a better rating.  Lentil soup was very amazing! Shish Tawouk (chicken) sandwich was good.  Baklava was sweet and fresh.  Knafe (cheese danish) lebanese was very interesting and a must-get.  This location really values their Yelp reviews, the server Shahd specifically gave me her name and she wanted me to mention her in my review.  The server took the time to explain their menu and answer questions.  There are 3 single-stall unisex washrooms.  There was a prayer room, if you want to pray which was unique.   Cons Znoud -l-sit a cream filled pastry did not taste good to us. It tasted cold and chewy like biting into cheescake.  Even with the button system, I couldn't tell if the server knew I was trying to get her attention. Think of it like a doorbell, I rang it but it still took several minutes to come. I guess I was expecting the server to come within 1 min.  Location was very busy, there was a lineup to be seated.  They also do delivery, I heard there was a large order $500+ that the kitchen was trying to fill within 30 min which is crazy!  Protip For the baclawa it's roughly 50 cents per piece, and there are 3 major types to try. In the photo you see over 15+ types.  They are giving away a 2018 Mercedes - Benz, enter on their website!  Damage $30 taxes in, before tip."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed.   The waiter we had was extremely awkward and made the experience feel awkward and kind of uncomfortable. I don't think they were comfortable in that role.   The food...too over priced for what you get. I ordered Fattoush Salad with chicken. The salad was eh - not that good - had the dressing but almost just tasted like a garden salad; the ingredients weren't soaked in the dressing so it didn't taste like a regular Fattoush to me, and I only got 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad. Those 4 pieces of chicken cost $6.99 to add to the $7.99 salad (pictures included in my review).   By the time you order 2 main entrees, your better off getting a platter - way better deal. Don't think the platter should be cheaper than 2 meals considering the platters come with a lot more food. Not priced correctly.   Service: awkward  Food: nothing amazing and Fattoush was really lacking in flavour.  Price: expensive for what you get.   Personally, I wouldn't go there again. Wish I read the reviews below before I decided to go."}
{"text":"Service is poor and so is their quality at this location. The order takes forever considering they are a mall location. Then you expect the food to be worth the wait which is totally not. Wouldn't recommend them, try their other locations."}
{"text":"Paramount Fine Foods has been having a great last couple of years of growth, culminating with the opening of their Pearson Airport locations.  Along in that growth was the opening of this location on Eglinton Ave in part of the Erin Mills Town Centre complex.  We tried numerous times to go and never were able to due to the lines.   Also add to the fact that the Tim Hortons location next door can make it a major PITA to get in and out of this location.  Paramount offers middle-eastern food, featuring exotic foods who's recipies have been passed down for generations.  The decor is ok, typical middle class family restaurant.  There is also a climbing area a little smaller than the climbing station in select McDonalds.  My daughter got into an altercation with one of the other kids in the play area.  My wife would not agree to a family platter with me so we both ordered individual entrees.  I had the mixed grill plate.  I figured that since it was my first time there, I'd sample a few different flavours.  So my plate came with beef, swish tawouk, and kafta.  With some veggies and bread on the side.  For me, the swish tawouk really stole the show - the texture, flavouring were great.    My wife had a tabouleh salad with chicken schwarma meat added to it.  She seemed to like it, as she paid the bill for this meal.  Also I'll agree with other reviewers on the part about ordering at the counter and paying upfront.  Its a little odd.  You get more table service than you would at Panera, but the business model ensures no dine-and-dash customers, but I can't see it being great for generating tips, as there's no incentive for great service.  If you're only going to eat here once - go during Ramadan there's no lineups.  Otherwise expect a crowd.  We don't do lines over 10 minutes due to my son's inability to tolerate lines."}
{"text":"Great decor, food is fresh, service loses points.  Actually, I would rate it 3.5 stars - read below.  This is a popular lunch joint, as it mixes dine-in with cafeteria styles.  The lunch rush is always busy, and for dinner it's filled with people as well.  For lunch, I've tried the HUMMUS WITH CHICKEN.  The hummus is very tasty, well infused flavour.  There are schwarma-bits chicken on the top, which adds warmth and flavour to the hummus - great portion for lunch (a circular tinfoil, piesize portion)  I have also had the full serving of TABOULI, which is just the best thing there.  Freshly diced parsley, with just the right amount of onion, lemon juice, tomatoes and whatever else they add in there.    I tried to PARAMOUNT SPECIAL - which is a delicious blend of fruit juice with puree strawberry at the bottom - topped off with shaved pistaccio, other fresh fruit - i thought this was going to be really sweet, but it was ok, wasn't too rich.  DINNER.  I also went there for dinner and we sat down, and the service wasn't great, the lady didn't speak English (which is usually fine) but she just stood there and stared at you.  I got the CHICKEN and BEEF SCHWARMA DINNER - which came with shaved chicken and beef, beets, rice or fries and pickles.  It was quite a sizeable meal.  The pickles and the sauce that came with it, was delicious.  The beets were a little old.  The rice was really plain, and the beef was a bit dry.  The chicken was good, I would recommend the chicken.  ASK FOR THE HOT SAUCE - it wasn't too spicy but the blend in herbs and flavors and whatever chunks of something in there made it a very gourmet hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here for take out at lunch, I arrived just after 11am to avoid the lunch rush.  Ordered the tabbouleh with beef shawarma.  Serving of tabbouleh was rather generous and the beef was tender and and flavorful.  Serving sizes are good value for the price my lunch cost approx $9.00.  I've only experienced store bought pita bread--it was a nice experience tasting a freshly baked one--what a difference it makes.  Service was very efficient the staff are very accommodating-I asked for a side of pickled turnips and was given a container full of them at no charge.  That level of service along with the pita bread will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great place. Staff need to concentrate but they were friendly and I loved the experience. We were visiting from Chicago and enjoyed Eid there with the family. Keep up the good work guys and please open in Chicago"}
{"text":"Yup, found myself back here again. Today we tried the Shish Tawouk (2 skewers of chicken breast grilled over a charcoal barbeque) served with rice and a Spinach & Cheese Manakeesh (a flat baked pizza topped with spinach, onions, sumac and accawai cheese) and two small baklava's for dessert.   (Tip/Note: it may be hard to tell, but most of their baklava's are only pistachio filled, there is only 1 baklava type that contains both cashews and pistachios, so its definitely a good idea to ask. I wouldn't have known if the server hadn't told me).   The chicken was fairly tender, juicy and not overly spiced allowing to taste the meat for what it is. The spinach manakeesh on the other hand, came with what seemed to be frozen spinach... Fresh spinach would have been nice. However, it was loaded with spinach nonetheless, and tasted pretty decent.  Can't say the service was the best on a weekday though. A tad slow: had to ask for their home made hot sauce from at least 2 different servers, then only to be served by a 3rd server who brought it out to us near the end of our meals.   Still a Paramount Fan and will be back to try other yummies from their menu."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 12 on Sunday night. The place is brightly lit and has a modern, fresh look. You pay at a counter and they bring the food to you.   I ordered the chicken and beef shawarama wrap for 14.59, 16.50 after tax i believe. it was a good sized portion. The chicken and beef tasted juicy and their garlic mash sauce tasted really delicious. I enjoyed the food, albeit a littleeee on the pricier side. I'd come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The other locations are much better. I ordered a takeout tabbouleh salad n lamb but what I got was garden salad n beef...But that's not the wrost...Wrost part was the portion... I paid almost 20 bucks for something I could of got for 10 elsewhere, where they would of got my order right. The beef was very tough n dry, sauces did not help and the salad was all diced up to tiny pieces. Come on... Lettuce is not that expensive ppl lol.. all in all.. try other locations.. this place is bad"}
{"text":"I've visited the Paramount Foods (the Don Mills location) for the first time the other day. Overall, it is average, both in terms of pricing and the food quality. There is not that much competition at the Shops at Don Mills, but there are far better (not to mention cheaper) options only a short drive away.  The decor and service are the high points. The place feels much bigger than it is, very clean and beautifully decorated. Servers are attentive and friendly.  The food is priced slightly higher than in comparable restaurants, but there is more variety and ordering options (dine-in, takeout and phone/online ordering).  I've ordered Chicken Shwarma Plate which came with a pita, fries (you can opt for white rice), chicken breast meat and a small amount of pickled vegetables / lettuce. My friend opted for a sandwich and a small pizza. Neither of us were particularly impressed with food or the bread. Everything just seemed a little bland, lacking a distinct flavour. There are much better options in the Don Mills & Lawrence area, specifically:  Al Tanoor - for Shawarma and great home-made bread  Mamajoun Armenian Pizzeria - for middle-eastern style pizza and sandwiches  Bamiyan Kabob - for Afgnani-style kabob dishes and salads, amazing home-made bread  All of the alternatives listed above are a better value for your $$$, but they do offer less variety of dishes and do not have as nice seating area/decor/service."}
{"text":"We came upon Paramount one evening after our plans changed when the restaurant we intended to visit was closed. It looked quite nice - clean, modern, well lit - so we gave it a try.  It's an odd atmosphere. You wait to be seated, then peruse the menu, then go up to a fast food-esque counter to place your order before returning to your seat. With the decor (and prices on some things) I expected a \"regular\" sit down restaurant.  We took a few minutes to look over the menu, which seemed to have a good variety of choices, before deciding on an appetizer (the Yalla Fries - like Middle Eastern-y poutine. Ish.), and 2 Saj sandwiches/wraps. The menu had the option to order the Saj as a combo meal OR just the wrap, and we both wanted just the wrap. When I told the woman behind the counter this, she said, \"Oh no, we can't do just the wrap.\". I was confused and pointed to it on the menu. She said, \"I know, but we just can't.\". I said, \"I don't want to waste the sides that come with a combo... I won't eat them.\" and she finally agreed that they could, in fact, do just the wrap after all. OK, whatever, we sat back down.  The appetizer came, and about 30 minutes later we still had no wraps. (It was not a busy night - most of the dining room was empty.) Finally, my boyfriend flagged a server down and asked about the order status. She was confused. We had to get our receipts out to prove we'd ordered the wraps. Eventually she went back to the kitchen, and the lady who took the order at the counter came back with some complimentary hummus and apologies. Our wraps came a short time later.   The food was decent, but we both agreed we've had better for less money. So honestly, I think I'd give Paramount a pass if someone suggested it in the future."}
{"text":"My absolute go-to meal when I am in Toronto on business.  I will drive across the city to go to the Mississauga location.  Warm, delicious bread and great hummus and chicken shawarma.  I love the yogurt fruit drink - I can't get enough."}
{"text":"I really loved Paramount when I first tried it at yonge and Dundas but HO---Ly!! It's now a rip off if you actually want a decent meal size! They skimp on the chicken portions and fill the plates with iceberg lettuce. Please stop being stingy with servings!!!"}
{"text":"I also wanted to talk about the Baklava that I tried here today.   I wasn't pleased when I walked into their location at Yonge and Steeles, because it was so loud and busy that no one took the time to explain what each one of these big plates were.   The baklava is served on these giant plates, and each one is different. There are no labels, so you need to go someone to help you explain.   The minute I was standing there, someone came over to help out. I asked what was in them, and she pointed and quickly said a succession of \"pistachio\" \"cashew\" at the different ones.  She also explained to me that each giant plate is different because of the ratio of nuts to pastry.   Pricing is at $24 a kilo, which would give you around 40 pieces.  In the end she got me an assorted half a kilo. I found out later, she even put in some of the specialty baklavas that actually are more expensive.   SO YUMMY, but very sweet.  Perfect house party dessert gift."}
{"text":"My review is strictly on the takeout since that is all I have had here.  I have been here a buncg of times and the food is very good. The portions are fresh, tasty and HUGE - 1 order is literately 2 meals, so you def. get your moneys worth here. The pita bread is fantastic and fresh...made right there in the ovens and comes out warm and delish. I also like the sauces that you get with the Shwarma, especially the garlic one!!  If you like garlic, this sauce is kick-ass!   The place is usually pretty crowded during the week, which is the only time I go there. The people are very diverse and ethnic, which to me is always a positive...You know the food is good, if your own people are in attendance!   When the weather is nice the windows open completely - almost like sitting in the street. You get to people watch and also be watched...and spoken to by the homeless people going by.  They do have a guy out there making sure they don't bother the patrons, but it is entertaining to watch...not sure if I would enjoy sitting there myself. I would probably rather sit inside and not be bothered. I know they also have an upstairs, but have never been up there.  The people that work there are young, and pretty funny.  I chat with them while I wait for my order, which is nice.   If in the area and in want of some good Mediterranean food at very reasonable prices, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out that a Paramount Fine Foods location just opened up by my area because the downtown location was great. My bf and I decided to give it a try after I was raving about it to him. The experience turned out to be a sour one.  It wasn't even busy made only 3 tables full..we weren't greeted and the worker kept saying that she will serve us in a minute a few times (not sure what she was doing). The manager also looked like he wasn't having a good day, didn't even smile or acknowledge the customers that were there. Basically as soon as you walk in you can't tell if its a sit down restaurant or a fast food joint. It was way too fancy to be a fast food restaurant but they had no servers. You order your food at the front and they bring the food to you.   We ordered what we would normally get at a middle eastern restaurant: chicken schwarma plate and fattoush salad with chicken. The server that took our order asked if we want hummus so we said \"sure\" not realizing that it would cost us $6! Total order later was $31 after we looked at our receipt..the worker didn't even tell us that there would be an extra charge for the hummus. Way to upsell? Thats pretty damn expensive for a dip and funny enough this was the only item that actually tasted good: the hummus dip and pita that came with it. My fattoush salad was nothing special it had some sort of vinaigrette dressing and pita chips (didn't like how that tasted in the salad). They also forgot the chicken on the salad which they remembered 5 mins later. The chicken was mediocre, was shredded into small pieces so made it seem like you were getting a lot but really it was just the leftovers that they had. The chicken was salty and oily, I had a weird after taste in my mouth. My bf ordered the chicken schwarma plate...same shredded chicken pieces and the fries that he ordered tasted like McCain fries.   Overall, our experience was not what we expected. Food did not taste authentic and it's overpriced for what you get. The extra dollars that you are paying for definitely is going to the appearance and and insensible playground area in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give -1 stars I would. This place was absolutely terrible. The wait for them to clean a table was strangely long when there were clearly waitresses available. You have to get up and order yourself which is fine, but get this, the women in front of us in line was charged $290 when her bill should have been $29. Then they tried telling her that's the store number she's seeing. Anyway, eventually they refunded the extra charge. Our food took a while to come, we were 6 people. Two of the dishes came but no plates or cutlery or bread. Are we supposed to eat with our hands? We asked for water 3 times. By the time all the food had come the first two plates were cold. Still no cutlery. We told the server girl (who strongly reminded me of a wet tissue) to get the manager. She walked all the way to the register then back and just looked at us. Her expression vacant. (Is she okay, did her boyfriend just dump her, like wth?). There were enough servers in the restaurant but (and I literally tracked them with my eyes for a solid 2 minutes) they are just walking back and forth doing NOTHING. They just bring menus then disappear. They avoid eye contact at all costs. This is such a strange place, it really had so much potential. The food is no where near good enough to put up with this service. Anyway, at least it gave me a chance to use Yelp."}
{"text":"I received an email from the owner offering me a free meal, with the statement \"Although the quantity will be the same, the quality will be better\". Hmmm, what is this supposed to mean?  Either way, I don't want the free meal, I stand by my review and the false advertising in the menu."}
{"text":"The food there is meh, have had better. The food needs a little more flavour. Price is way to expensive. Some staff are nice & helpful while others are extremely rude. Wouldn't recommend this particular place. Although most food isn't the greatest, their homemade bread & pizzas are pretty good & there Paramount special drink is something to try.  I just want to make this clear to all and the reason I want to mention that this person isn't being truthful is first of all I've done everything for these people, worked 7 days a week, sometimes even 10 to 12 hour shifts, they never liked to give days off and the one day I asked off (month in advance) was to go to a wedding. They never gave me a real answer. Just said if I don't call you to not come in. Didn't call me so I didn't go in. I NEVER just took the day off. Second I NEVER stole from them. I'm a way better person and brought up better then that. I work hard for my stuff! And it's insulating for someone to lie about something like that. And lastly I was NEVER TERMINATED. I ended up quitting because they treated me and the staff poorly and they never wanted to give days off. They took, took and took but never gave back. It says something when all the original staff quit. No one liked it there and for good reason."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, and friendly service.  A few friends and I decided to come here for dinner during the week. We were greeted immediately and gave us the option of sitting on the 2nd level. The atmosphere was cozy and our waiter served us as soon as we sat down.  We ordered Tabouli, Hummus and a meat platter dish to share. You are also served complimentary pita bread which was freshly baked making us asking for seconds.  The food was fresh, tasty and was the right amount if you are sharing. The individual entree meals are bigger in portion so be prepared to eat but the price is a great value!"}
{"text":"Lebanese food is always yum. We had chicken shwarma plates. For food court food, it's pretty good. Portion size could be a bit bigger (was really hungry today). Lady who works there is really nice! I heard they have Paramount restaurants downtown so I will probably go there to eat, if I crave Lebanese food. It's been over 5 years since I ate Lebanese food so this was pleasant ^^"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. The cashier promised to expedite my order because I was short on time and she promised my order to be ready in 5 minutes, and after waiting for 14 minutes I was told my order was about to start and they were surprised I asked for a refund. Never again"}
{"text":"I was impressed by this location in terms of food, service and ambience. My wife loves the moutabal out there and we make it a point to order that as our regular appetizer. It tastes so good with the traditional freshly baked Arabic bread. Our main course was chicken shawarma plate with fries and chicken shawarma saj served on a wooden platter. I'd definitely go back to try beef shawarma and manakeesh. Usually I have the beef kafta which is also awesome."}
{"text":"One of my most horrible experiences due to a lack of customer focused service. The food did not live up to the hype and was pretty ordinary in quality and taste. Our visit was on Friday, December 22, 2017 at about 6:30 - 7:00pm.  After a hard year's work, my wife, son and I decided to have a nice meal out. The Restaurant was recommended by few friends and so we decided to come here. Big mistake! The food quality was nothing to rave about but was not bad either. The price was reasonable.  The service is criminal. First, my wife's meal came before us and for 15mins after that we were waiting for our meal. She waited for us so we had to send it back to be heated and to be brought back with rest of the meals. Next, throughout our meal the 4 staff by the kitchen was having a conversation as loud as ever which I consider to be very rude when guests are present. The final blow was that the so called Paramount bread did not come and had to reminded the server half way through the meal. It ultimately arrived when we were done with our meal. There was no concept of service excellence ever present throughout our visit. Sorry, I was not motivated to leave a tip as the server himself did not know what was going on. He looked lost about his role as a server. I have been a server myself for a long time and we were trained and reinforced to give even greater attention if a guest was inconvenienced, so that nothing else goes wrong.   The most humorous part of the day is when I asked the server for the name of the manager he said \"Manager is Rohil\" and a person was called. I asked if he was Rohit and he sarcastically corrected the \"t\" to an \"l\" in the name and said \"he is not here today and I am the Assistant Manager.\" So, I brought our experience to the notice of this gentleman who identified himself as the Assistant Manager (dark blonde shabby hair and he wore a black frame pair of glasses). This gentleman did not allow me to finish what I had to say and stated \"I know sir, I have eyes too. I saw that one meal came early and your bread came late. BUT, listen our kitchen is organized in sections.....\" and started to explain about the kitchen set-up to defend why one meal came early. When I tried to explained that we were there as a family, he interrupted and said \"listen, listen, listen to me sir.\" When I replied back with \"first listen to your guest\"; his response was \"first listen to me sir.\" These two statements by both parties were exchanged a quite a few times and the Assistant Manager was persistent in getting the last word in. I was confused for a while whether to laugh or be appalled by his lack of customer care. My family and myself were certainly appalled and just walked away as it was clear he was not going to be empathetic or listen. The humour did not stop there, he followed us out of the restaurant trying to defend the kitchen set up.  I attribute this bad experience to a total lack of a service excellence culture, and the actual manager not being on site.  This is one restaurant that I will never recommend or visit again. We are forced to give '1 Star' and if I had the choice, I will give no stars but just this review.  Get your act together Paramount!!"}
{"text":"Its been years since I ate at Paramount. The menu and dining environment has been revamped so it's much nicer now.  We got a half order of the mixed combo platter, and it was more than enough for 2 people. You get to try chicken and beef shawarma, chicken and beef kebabs, kafta, and falafel. You get some hummus with it and fresh baked pitas.  The beef seems much drier than the chicken FYI. Their fries are great, well fried and great flavour. The rice is also awesome.   When you enter, you wait to get seated, but when you're ready to order you just give the counter your table number and what you want. They'll bring it to your table. Servers are helpful, but don't come around often, so make sure you ask for what you want in one go.  Good value and worth coming back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today on a cold wintery day. We arrived at around 2.30pm and the place was virtually empty. We ordered a fattoush salad, beef manakeesh, mezza plate, chicken shawarma wrap, mixed grill plate and a chicken & beef shawarma plate. The fattoush salad was good. The beef manakeesh was delicious, like a warm flat bread/ thin pizza. I would definitely order this again. The mezza plate was so so. I found the tabbouleh much too acidic. The chicken shawarma wrap was gobbled up fast, by my son. So I presume it was quite good. The mixed grill plate, we ordered with fries. The strip loin beef was too dry and tough. The chicken skewer was ok. The kafta skewer was the most moist, out of all 3 meats and the best tasting. The fries were quite good too. The meat on the mixed shawarma plate wasn't good at all, the beef being the drier of the 2. I wouldn't order that again, but I personally hate dry meat. With a fresh mint tea, the total bill was just under $80. The service was ok, the lady checked on us a few times but she didn't refill our water glasses until towards the end of our meal. I wouldn't come back to order any shawarma meats or some of the skewers but the manakeesh are worth returning for."}
{"text":"service fantastic. atmosphere fantastic. Food. fantastic. love the manakeshes and the smoothies. But if you are paitent (takes long to make it) get the bbq meat sandwhich or plate. oh so good and much better than any shwarma"}
{"text":"Having been to several Paramount Fine Foods establishments (Yorkdale, Yonge and Eglinton), I thought that the location at Glen Cameron and Yonge would be the same, so we ventured on inside for dinner.  When we walked in, the place was pretty quiet -- and then an employee greeted us and asked if we were eating it, or order to-go.  We indicated that we were dining in, so he quickly walked and we followed.  We then disappeared into the back, leaving my husband and I standing in the middle of the restaurant, somewhat confused.  He cane back out and lead us into the dining area.  To be honest, it was really strange.  We sat down and as we were perusing the menu, the staff at the cooking stations (open concept kitchen) were discussing the meats (beef) that was roasting and how it was too dry.  Perhaps they were undergoing training or quality control, but it was quite loud -- enough for me to be distracted.  We ordered our food (which required us to go to the to-go cashier to make our order) and waited.  While we were waiting for our meal, we asked one of the employees about how their restaurant runs -- they told us that it was part take-out/express and part dine-in.  To me, it was fine, but it would have been nice to make that distinction from other Paramount locations.  We came into the restaurant wanting a dining experience, rather than an express-type environment.  Okay, so the food: the trio dip was good, the pita was delicious, the chilli was way overpriced ($6.99) for what was given, and moving onto the patoush salad (please mind my spelling) and added a beef skewer (+$6.00).  The salad was dismal -- was not seasoned well and, to be honest, looked old.  As my husband was eating, I noticed a sticker in the salad.  I quickly called over an employee and asked him to take a look.  He apologized and said he would ask the kitchen to remake the dish for us.  We had asked it to be packed to go -- and we went on our way.  When we got home and looked at the dish, it honestly looked like the skewer was remade, but the salad portion was significantly smaller than the original dish -- it almost seemed like they just dumped the leftover salad into a to-go container.  Although the employee who was serving us was a great worker, helpful and nice, I would never return.  There were watermarks on the ceilings and the atmosphere of the restaurant was lacking.    Stars? 1.5 stars -- solely for the waiter."}
{"text":"Huuuugggeeeee rip off - not at ALL like the Paramount at Yonge & Dundas  The sandwich wraps are barely stuffed with anything - it's like you're eating 70% dry pita bread, 20% soggy vegetables and 10% VERY dry meat. Super low standards, clearly. I went through 3 bottles of water with HALF of a large sandwich because it's so dry!   Ordered with a friend who said it's \"the worst shawarma I've had in my life\"   Couple the tiny portion and dry taste with expensive prices, and you've got a recipe for 1 star reviews.  Not surprising at all that at the time of me writing this, they have a 2 star based on 18 reviews.   Unfortunately, I have to bring that average score down. I really hoped this location would be good."}
{"text":"Had dinner in a Sunday night of the Victoria Day long weekend. The place was emptier than our previous visits.  Ordered two Falafel wraps, a Fatoush Salad, a Falafel plate, A Mezza Plate - an appetizer consisting of Hummus, Baba Ghanoush and tabbouleh, a Saj wrap, a zatar and cheese manakeesh and an order of fries. Lot of food but costed $70 + which included taxes and tips. A bit too much for a casual restaurant. We have been to a few Mediterranean restaurants and this one tops it.  The Saj wrap had cheese in a thin pita and no flavour. The falafel platter has nothing but falafels and some fixings that do nothing. Our other experience at other restaurants had so much to offer in a platter that it is a dinner. Not this one. The falafel wraps are dry as well and I think they skimp on fillings such as garlic sauce and tahini sauce.   Not a memorable visit. The restaurant in spite of being not busy, when requested some pita, they forgot both times and had to wait. Requested again and got it after a few minutes. This repeated again during the main meal as well. Same thing for water.  Asked for some hot sauce and same thing again and got in a tiny container. Disappointing!!!  The tip was added to the bill before the food came otherwise the service did not earn the 15%.   May not go there again!! But love Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Nostalgic for me. Has room for improvements if they want to score more but I personally am more than happy with them. Nice people n nice food. Would def go back there A LOT MORE!"}
{"text":"Something wrong with the service, but such good food.  They took our order correctly and the bill showed it, but what we received didn't resemble that. It was 11:30 am Sunday morning and we were the only ones there. I had ordered the breakfast Fatteh with chicken shwarma on top. I received a plate of iceberg lettuce covered in oil, with literally 4 pieces of vegetables (2 cucumber, 1 yellow pepper, 1 green pepper) and chicken shwarma on top. I had never had the Fatteh before so I didn't immediately realize that this was not it. I ate the chicken, which was delicious. Hot and crispy, just the way I like it.  They told me later that I had received their Fatoosh salad. I really hope that it was just an accident from begin to finish, because that was a sad salad.   My breakfast partner ordered falafel, and eggs with sausage. Got the falafel, which was the best falafel I've tried in Toronto. But never got the eggs or sausage. I had to go ask what was up, and the server had to go talk to the two dude-bros in the kitchen who were obviously not giving her straight information. Server told us a few minutes later that they do not have eggs. How does a restaurant not have eggs? On Sunday morning? And not tell us until 15 minutes after giving me an incorrect order? I felt bad for the servers. They didn't do anything wrong, but did not seem prepared for this situation. She kept asking us what they could do. We suggested a refund. At that moment a Fatteh arrived. I told the server we'd eat this and be okay. It was hot and tasty. The flummoxed server came back later, refunded half our bill and gave us a small box of desserts. We gave her a tip, and a quizzical look to the cooks.  TL;DR: Fantastic food. Servers seemed to lack leadership and cooks seemed to lack a clue. Hope nobody else wanted eggs today.  Will return and re-review. Thanks Paramount for encouraging me to write this! I wouldn't have, otherwise."}
{"text":"I came here today with my friends to try a new place. I was pleasantly surprised as the staff was very friendly and the food was even better.  We got a few dishes to share: 1. Mixed grill plate: 9/10 this was amazing! I couldn't get enough of any part of the dish. It was really well balanced with the rice, meat, salad, pickled beets, pickles and bread. I would definitely recommend this dish.  2.Tabbouleh salad with BBQ shrimp skewer added: 9/10. I loved the portion size; just enough to satisfy your craving. It is a bit on the salty side but that's how I like it, although some people wouldn't. The shrimp was also very tasty! I would also highly recommend this dish!  3. Lentil soup: 7/10. I ordered this after having heard good things about it. I personally didn't like it as much as the rest of the food, which were seasoned perfectly. I would not recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Weird, but great.  Love the patio.  It's odd, but beautiful even though you are staring at warehouse buildings.    Ordered lamb sandwich - excellent though kinda pricey at 8.99.  Included two huge pita bread with no dipping sauce, appreciate it but what are two people supposed to do with those huge pieces of bread when they both ordered sandwiches/shawarmas?  Oh well, it's good, will try again later."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day with a colleague. As first timers we were a bit confused as to how everything operated. We were seated and given menus but had to go up, order and pay and then our food was brought to our table.  The cashier was really nice and she even brought me a salad on the house due to some confusion. A guy in the dessert section was also really nice, as he let me sample a baklava before deciding to purchase a small box.  I got a chicken shawarma plate and I wasn't really impressed with the flavour, especially because I had high expectations from many people telling me Paramount was the place to go for Middle Eastern food. The baklava and kanefeh was alright but I still prefer my go-to Baklawa King. I'd come back and give these guys another chance just to see if it was an off day and because I really appreciated their level of service and friendliness."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here, and while their chicken shawarma was fresh and delicious the rest was rather bland. Their rice in particular lacked any flavour whatsoever. The garlic sauce was okay, but I've definitely had better.  The price wasn't too bad, but I think I'd try a few other places before I ordered from them again."}
{"text":"I honestly fail to see why people love them on yelp.  The place is spacey but that's about it. This place has authentic middle eastern customer service, and by that I mean everyone is arrogant and unhelpful. No one came to take our order. We were ignored multiple times.  We had to get out of our table and go to the front and order.  I ordered Manakeesh and a chicken / beef shawarma plate. Manakeesh were OK. But the shawarma was so dry that I almost choked. The pita bread underneath the shawarma was dry too (a huge red flag!!). Fries were undercooked.   This place has potential but needs better management. For now I say stick to Manakeesh and get your shawarma fix somewhere else."}
{"text":"First off, staff was very rude and to be honest quite racist; we were told to \"just point at the picture and order, it's easier\" when no other table was told this. And it just so happened we were the only Chinese individuals in the restaurant.    Everything was dry, orders took close to an hour to make. When the order did come, it was made wrong, had given the table all fries instead of rice (we weren't asked which we preferred). The manager had said he would bring each of us a side of rice, this never happened and the manager seemed to go into hiding.   Portions are extremely tiny versus the amount other Paramount locations provide. Highly disappointed, please don't ever come here. Worst place ever, it can't even be called a restaurant and needs to be closed down already."}
{"text":"A big WOW!  Gorgeous interior, fresh grilled meats, delicious hummus & fresh baked pita.  Service was attentive & friendly.  An excellent experience."}
{"text":"Superior Restaurant now serves Middle Eastern Food! just j/k. I'm sad to see the restaurant go (a great fine dining place pre theatre) but excited to be replaced by a great addition to the Yonge strip.  Here's an example how different locations of the same restaurant don't offer the same quality.   I've been a big fan of the Mississauga location. Over there, they've perfected the self serve lunch time crowd and food comes quick to your table and your bill is waiting for you at the cashier up front.   It's a whole different story here. With a table of 8, we walked in and were seated downstairs. They really need to get a ceiling fan in here, because the heat and humidity was unbearable. It would not have made a comfortable dinner. We asked if we could move upstairs and it took the girl at least 10 mins before she could go up and check.  When we went to check on our own, we got reprimanded unnecessarily.   Finally, someone told us we could sit upstairs but would have to be a booth, table combination. It was a much better and fresher air up here.   Now, I'd have to give the service here a 2 star. For about 10 tables upstairs there was only one server. Not her fault, but the management. When she did show up, she was super friendly and had a great attitude - but it was hard to get her attention.   In the end, we had been at the restaurant for over 30 mins but had not ordered even though we were ready.   Things we liked:  - the hummus ($4.99 for a big bowl)  - grape leaves wrapped with tomato and rice ($5.99 for 6)  - manakesh pizzas for $2-4 (a personal sized pizza good enough for one person)  - sandwiches for $5-7 (pitas)  - big pouffy pitas that come with every meal  - great attitude from our server (when she showed up)  - immediate asking for separate bills and paying for the bill at the table with portable machine/cash  Things we did not like:  - long waits to get servers attention  - when our pita wraps arrived, the person bringing it did not have a very good system of keeping track of what's what (small rips in the paper indicated, lamb/chicken/shish taouk/shish taouk no pickles  - the pita was not as stuffed as in the Mississauga location  - although whole wheat was offered, it seemed like there was only one wheat  - i got a beef sharwma plate that comes with tahini, rice or fries, pickles - the beef was dry every though flavourful.   I would recommend coming here for take out and try their BAKLAVA. I never understood why they price it by weight ($26/kg) because it's not a good representative of what you'd get. For about $12 (half kilo) you get a medium sized portion with about 20 pieces. They are small, and perfect for the hostess gift.  Coming here for a sit down, was tiring and stressful. What I thought would be a quick dinner, turned into a 2.5 hr long ordeal. I was glad I was in good company that I didn't notice."}
{"text":"# of Visits: 1 Date(s) of visit: 12/22/2013 Food: 3.25/5 Service: 2.5/5 Decor: 3/5  So seriously, I've been to 2 Paramount's and I don't get the hype.  While I think the meat is very fresh, it tastes somewhat bland.  I ordered the Fatteh, which is a mix of chick peas, hummus, fried pita bread topped with melted butter and fried nuts with beef shawarma on top.  This came to $10.50 before taxes.    What I liked: everything was very fresh.  The beef, the chick peas and the fried pita bread.  They also give two massive pieces of fresh oven baked bread.    What I didn't like:  Price - I find it kind of expensive.  Also, I found out after my meal that they do have hot sauce.  The cashier never asked if I wanted any.  In addition, I asked for water at the cashier and at the table and it never came.  So I went to the bar and asked for water and the server seemed resistant to give it to me.  It was weird.  So I got my food and finished 90% of it before getting water.  Odd.  Granted, they were busy, but it shouldn't be hard to serve a person a glass of water.  While they give the bread, I find the bread kind of tasteless and they should add hummus to it or something.    Verdict:  While this may be to some people's tastes, I find the food at Paramount's overrated and would much prefer any Middle Eastern food from the small hole in the wall joints in downtown Toronto.  So 2.75/5."}
{"text":"Mia amigos y yo fuimos a propar este lugar nuevo en Etobicoke. El lugar nut agradable y la comida fue Rica. But but, el servicio fue muy Malo. Nose dieron la order equivocada y no querian tomar accion haste a que el Gerente.  Decidio hablar con nosotros finalmente despues de 40 min Recivimos nuestra comida. Regresare porque al final el gerente tomo accion.  Recomendaccion entrenen bien a su personal."}
{"text":"Fresh bread and hummus is some of the best I have head. The meat tends to be over cooked, with multiple experiences. Very pricy compared to the availability of halal and middle eastern food in Toronto. However, customer service can be much better."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was soo looking forward to taste their food because of the reviews that I read.  Ok I ordered Shish Tawouk at 3:14 pm, my food was called to be picked up at the counter at around 3:33... woh!  It's not even busy... I was the only one waiting for my order. The chef (owner) kept on talking on the phone. Line started to build up while i was waiting and two people decided to leave because nobody was at the cashier to cater them. Only  3 stars I can give because of the service. My over all experience was not pleasant at all.. my lettuce is not fresh, it has brown spots.  The food was nice but the rice was everywhere. . It made a mess on my tray not in my plate.  I might consider going back because my husband likes lebanese food. But I hope they can improve their service.   By the way.. Cristina the one that served me is  really nice She was suppose to be in the counter taking orders but the chef/owner keeps on calling her to do almost everything.. While they have many people just walking around. Interesting."}
{"text":"Paramount Fine Foods is a great place to check out if you are looking for some authentic Lebanese cuisine. This location is conveniently located in the heart of downtown, which is very nice. I decided to come check out this place, based on a recommendation from a friend who frequents this place often.   When I first entered this place, my friend and I were immediately seated into a very nice booth in the second floor which had an amazing interior decor design. The decor felt like we were inside a home style barn with a warm touch.   Immediately after we were seated in our booth, we were served freshly baked pita bread with their hot sauce. I'll tell you guys, it was an amazing combination between warm pita bread and sauce.   I had a hard time deciding on what to order and I did not want to have anything too substantial in size, so I decided to try the chicken shawarma sandwich. It was freshly prepared and came to our table in a short amount of time. The shawarma at Paramount was one of the most delicious I've had in Toronto. There was a lot of meat inside the sandwich which was nice for the quantity.   The service was amazing as our waiter was amazing as he was always to help my friend and I with our every request for more hot sauce, pita bread. or water. I would definitely come back soon to try the other dishes that this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Great variety , great quality. A bit pricey but it's well worth it if you're having a craving for some middle eastern cuisine :)"}
{"text":"I found this place is very good on many of my lunches. It does get extremely busy during the lunch hour, so get in there early or later on to avoid crowd. Oh yeah, one important thing to mention is \"there is no alcohol\", no beer, no wine."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant. The interior looked dirty and unclean, it took a long amount of time for them to even get our orders, or bring us water. Our food took an hour to come out yet, other people around us already received their food and finished it! Once my food came I did not even receive the meal I ordered, they gave me something different since they ran out of what I wanted and did not even inform me. My friends food looked as if it was sitting out for a long time as well. Not to even mention how below average the food tasted. Would NOT recommend. There are many BETTER options in the food court, that actually taste good and have proper service."}
{"text":"On one beautiful evening this summer, I joined my brother's family and the parents on a walk to Paramount new location. We were seated almost immediately and the staff was kind to accommodate the large party and provide the space for two strollers.    What followed was a sequence of everything a restaurant should NOT do, food was served at random intervals, we had to deal with many not several, yes tons of waiters and waitresses. It was is annoying that we have to repeat our orders to the new waiter or waitress, everyone of those waiters and waitresses then will walk and have a brief Conversation with a guy wearing  a top white T-shirt who seems in charge.  We had to constantly ask for missing food items and we finally received the missing orders we were socked by the poor quality of food and taste. The grilled chicken felt it was reheated several times in a microwave and had unpleasant smell, the burger was grilled on a volcano see photo. I wasted time and money going to that place I'm done wasting time describing my experience. The team who is running that restaurant should not hold any job.  Paramount you deserve a zero star. For talking your local community for granted. Too bad there is a lack of competition."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.   I don't know where to begin. There's no one there to seat you, you have to seat yourself. That's fine but all the tables are dirty. When we're finally seated, the waiter tells me he will clean the table for us. I waited 10 minutes and had to further complain that I wanted them to clean the table.   When they finally come to clean the table, they only wipe it off with a cloth, leaving grease all over the table. Absolutely filthy. To top it off, they accidentally brought an Oder to our table. We had to tell them to take it back as it was a mistake.    I'm a pretty tolerant person, so I let it slide and have them a chance. They brought dishes and cutlery and they were just as disgusting - there was food remains on the plates and cutlery. Oh and did I tell you about the ripped menu?  Do not go here. I've been to other locations and the food was sub-par. The cleanliness on the outside of the store should be a reflection of the kitchen, which is guaranteed filthy. Go to a restaurant that respects both you and your money."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, horrible service.   Next time we will order take out.  I would not criticize the service if the staff was overwhelmed, but while we were ignore for 20 minutes, there were 2 servers chatting at the front of the store, and another 2 at the back. Not only was it impossible to order, but at the end of the meal, we gave up on waiting for the bill we had requested.  We weren't the only diners being ignored, many around us walked to the cash register with no bill either.  We were hoping the food would be bad so we could just hate the place, but the food was really good, generous portions, and very fresh.  Next time it will be strictly take out."}
{"text":"I love middle eastern food ! I'm so glad this place opened up near my neighbourhood .. But I wish the service was faster at peak hours. The sharwma aren't as big as I anticipated .. Customer service needs some working on."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Dropped in here for take out as I was hungry and on the go. I ordered the Kafta wrap and it was such a rip off. The taste of the beef wasn't bad but the toppings were minimal AND on top of that they left out the tomatoes. Since I was hungry I ate it anyways instead of going back, and waiting to get tomatoes in it. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't eat here !  Overpriced and underwhelming !  I'm at a crossroads on how many stars - 1/2 star for customer service and 2 1/2 stars for the food.  I go here usually an the way back from a trip and grab take out for home.  I LOVE the food when they first opened and  I would have given the food a five (for sure) ......but the staff are horrible. They don't listen to what you order and when you ask for something like a couple extra slices of turnip or a side of tahini sauce  - OMG the attitude is unbelievable.  This just haven't happened once but over 4 different visits. Last night I ordered 2 sides of babaganoush and chicken shawarma plate. The server walked around with my take out container for over 2 minutes just wandering from the hot station to another counter - then she started to put tabouli salad in and another server said to her, you can go in you break when you finish this order - she takes off her gloves and leaves the container and walks away  - - a solid 5 minutes later another sever picks up the container and puts chicken in and closes it. I got home and the container with the chicken was some soggy 2 day old tabouli with a little (maybe 3 tablespoons) of chicken and no rice, oh but I did get the four slices of turnip. Not sure what the other side was I ordered, doesn't  matter because I didn't get it and in all the shuffling of the container I guess I didn't realize what was in or out of it. .....and this I paid $28.00 for !!! Shame .....I guess this made up my mind I'm not eating here anymore. Not worth the frustration knowing I'm not going to be happy ordering or eating it.   Shane - I've been to their restaurant on Yonge Street and its outstanding !!!!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant plenty of times and finally decided to stop by. I read reviews before ordering so I wasn't expecting much.   We shared an order of the chicken & beef shwarma plate, beef & cheese manakeesh and hummus. All were delicious although I found the portion of the shwarma plate to be very small, especially given that it was pricier than most other joints. The pita and hummus were definitely star of the show...it's enough to make me come back. The pita was fresh out of the oven...warm and crispy and perfect with the hummus.  Maybe I was lucky that day but I found the service to be great. We were greeted by a young man and seated immediately. He was patient, helpful with the menu and very attentive. I wish I caught his name.   I will definitely revisit soon to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Paramount is just down the street from my office and I love a good falafel.   I was recently \"honoured' with the task of conducting monthly department meetings and work which involves ordering lunch for about 25 people. After 3 years of bagel lunches, a few people complained. Part of me was like \"It's free lunch, shut up!\" and part of me could see the merit in their dissatisfaction.   So when I saw on Paramount's website that they do large catering orders (which you have to pick up), I thought it was an easy decision.   I ordered chicken and beef skewers (sold by the pound), falafel balls ($1 each), lots of hummus and pita and tabouleh. Healthy department lunch time! Everything was under $200 for the whole department and was ready when I went to pick it up. While they were sealing everything to make sure nothing popped over on my walk back to work, a lovely man who seemed really interested in certain parts of my body offered me a falafel ball while I was waiting. I was like....what? In my hand? When he nodded as though this was completely normal, I obliged and stood there, in my high heels and work attire, eating a falafel ball with my bare hands, no napkin and no utensils. And it was so good.   I haven't eaten in so I have no comments on that, but they're a great alternative to boring sandwich lunches if you're in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"Paramount is a good lunch spot if you like middle eastern food. Fast service even when there is a short line most days. They provide free pipping hot shawarma puffy breads which are delicious.  Minus one star: Prices are mediocre. Other similar middle eastern restaurants (that are hole in the wall joints) are cheaper but this probably due to it being in a prime location near Eatons.  Also minus another star because I find their meats and toppings and sauces to not be as flavourful as the non chain restaurants. Recommend the chicken and beef mixed dinner plate."}
{"text":"Too much over priced and tasteless food. The people working there are all extremely very rude  . But price of food is ridiculous for the type and amount of food.  This place used to be good a long time back and then since they started branching out, they lost the taste service and respect for customers.  If they can change all their servers then I might come back and also reduce prices for food. Cmoon a shawrma is very expensive. I rather go to burger king and eat 6 whoppers for the price of one damn shawrma.  I don't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to just try middle Eastern food ."}
{"text":"A lot of people like this place, so I decided to go and have a falafel here. I'm not impressed, its tastes stale. Maybe comparing to dearboorn is unfair, but falafel has to be made to order or it tastes like hockey puck."}
{"text":"This was almost a four star review, had I decided to skip dessert this would have surely been a four star review. But there was such an egregious error committed in the preparation of my dessert that I had to deduct one star (more on this to come).   I have been to several of Paramounts locations (they have three, one in Mississauga, one downtown, and this one) and I have always had a satisfying meal. On this occasion I decided to opt for a bowl of fateh and a manakeesh with zaatar. I will start with the manakeesh with zaatar (zaatar is a traditional middle eastern spice mixture which includes something like 20 different herbs and spices including sesame and thyme). For the manakeesh, the zaatar is mixed with olive oil put over a pizza type dough and baked in their wood fire oven, The result is a lemony and very zesty pizza like concoction. I believe that the wood burning oven is the real crown jewel of this place, anything made in it taste amazing, especially their homemade pita which comes to your table fresh and hot out of the oven, simply to die for.   Next I went for the fateh, this is a middle eastern brunch dish and is only available here on weekends. It is basically a dish of hummus, mixed with crispy fried pita bread and whole chick peas, then topped with tahini, olive oil and cashews. The result is a layered dish with a great texture. The chickpea and hummus mix is quite good and not too garlicky, the fried bread and cashews provide a much needed crunch. This dish was quite good, and the serving was generous ($6.95). I have a big appetite and was only able to finish about half the dish. Fateh is quite heavy and basically lays in your stomach like a rock! (Caution this is not pre-workout or pre-marathon food).  My sister opted for the chicken shawarma plate. I have had many of their grilled platters in the past and they do their grilled meat and shawarma quite well. Their hummus is also very good.   After our meal we opted for dessert. Their sweet table is quite impressive and one could have a difficult time making a decision. I decided on a piece of knafeh (Nablus style), this is basically a dish of sweet vermicelli like noodles fried crisp, layered with a sweet cheese, drenched in syrup and coloured a bright orange. When made properly this is a crunchy, cheesy, and incredibly sweet dish that is to die for. However the fellow behind the sweet counter decided to put mine in the microwave (knafeh is traditionally served warm so the cheese melts), needless to say I was shocked that my dessert was being nuked, if he had given me the option I would have rather eaten it cold then have it nuked. Out of the microwave my dessert had become a mushy mess which was not enjoyable at all, this horrible error resulted in an automatic deduction of 1 star from this review, absolutely unforgivable. If you decide to have dessert here get some assorted baklava, they do it well. .   Overall this is a good place if you are craving some middle-eastern food. The set-up is a little bit different, you order at the counter, wait for your food to be brought to you and pay at the end. You do not really have a waiter so I will not comment on the service.  The price is reasonable, my sister and I had lunch and dessert which came up to $35 (tax and tip in). They also have large combo platters so this would be a good place for a big group."}
{"text":"I had takeout from this paramount but it was really good! I had the chicken with cheese manakeesh and it was absolutely amazing... it's like a medditarian pizza... I truly enjoyed the crispness of the flatbread and there was the perfect amount of cheese on it as well."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Bland. Awesome hummus but terrible that it's all in plastic. Real bad message and lack of respect for environment no?"}
{"text":"Everything was great, except for the fact I was emotionally distraught that they forgot about my order and I had to wait 20 minutes before I got it while everyone else ate their lunch.  It only takes them a couple of minutes to whip up a sandwich (which are more like wraps) and I stood there watching them make other food orders that came after mine thinking mine would be the next one...but no, hello?  It got me hangry.  I just wanted fooooood.  Hopefully this was just bad luck and it won't happen to you and you'll have a 5 star experience because their food is delicious.  The decor is nice and the upstairs looks pretty cool from where I was standing downstairs.  This place was busy during lunch time, and we stood by the cashier to place our order.  The lady was very nice and friendly even though she was busy and very pretty.  I give her 5 stars.  The $6 freshly made mango strawberry smoothly was sweet and delicious (with no sugar added).  I wonder how they get this drink so thick.  The $7 beef shawarma sandwich was full of fresh ingredients (including parsley, onion, turnips, pickles, tomatoes & tahini sauce) and was easy to eat.  My coworker likes it because they have Halal meat.  The baklawas here are AMAZING! Again, 5 starts right here.  I've never said this before, so take this seriously, THE best baklawa I've ever had at a restaurant.  They have a variety of them, some stuffed with pistachio or cashew nuts.  They are soft and not too sweet.  $26.00/kg."}
{"text":"My partner and I come here often. They have the best falafel sandwiches I've ever had and I love their spicy tomato and onion manakeesh. Ambience is great and the ethnic music is beautiful and upbeat. The staff are also friendly and the food comes out surprisingly quickly, considering we order so much food every time we are there."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is horrendous. If you are considering trying Paramount Fine Foods Liberty Village I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There is absolutely nothing \"fine\" about the food at this place. Frankly it couldn't be further from \"fine\". The attention and care this place puts into the quality and taste of their food is about the same attention you would expect a heroin addict to pay to the cleanliness of the needle they use. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with fries and a shish tawook plate with white rice. What little chicken there was among the pile of crap I got served was hard, cold, and dry as if it were a week old.    If I could give lower than a one star rating I would. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else for dinner.  I ordered a chicken shwarma plate with some falafel on the side.  Chicken was seasoned well but served warm (at best) over cold rice with some weak veggies on the side.  Falafel was dry and heavy  At least service was quick."}
{"text":"Nothing fine about this place. Never again, overpriced and under quality.  Tried the chicken schwarma was way salty."}
{"text":"I didn't see the reviews for this place until after we had sat down. We did wait quite a long time for our food which was frustrating considering the restaurant was not that busy.  The waitresses were pleasant and relatively attentive. As for the food itself - I would say, decent. Definitely better than expected considering the previous reviews so far. It satisfied my craving for shawarma, but I can't say that I'll be back. Definitely a bit over priced considering the quality you get."}
{"text":"We asked for water at the beginning of our most recent meal here. By the end of the meal? Still no water.   I've visited this location several times (and the Paramount brand at other locations the last couple of years), and I've consistently left this location with the same impression that: while the food is hearty and decently delicious, it's understaffed, food quality has plummeted, and the wait times are unmanaged and can be pretty long, even during mid-week!  Over several visits, I've had the chicken shawarma dinner main course (mainly with rice or french fries, but I always wonder afterwards why I went with the fries - always seemed like a weird combination after I actually got my meal), the beef & chicken shawarma main course, and various appetizers including the hummus. Side note - their hummus used to be complimentary, going along with the free pita bread. Unfortunately, now they make you pay! We paid for a big bowl of hummus on my most recent visit. The chicken shawarma is indeed delicious and a solid go-to, but I've noticed that portion sizes have decreased recently, and quality and freshness isn't what it used to be.  On a positive note, ambiance is bright and great for big groups and families. If you actually get a hold of a server, on occasion, they can also be quite pleasant. There's also a decent amount of parking available, in the plaza they share with Tim Horton's/Wendy's.  I feel like this place has become increasingly commercialized and gradually forgot the value of decent customer service and quality food. Shawarma cravings hit me now and again, and due to convenience and proximity of its location to areas I frequent, I'll probably be back here one day. But, it wouldn't be my first choice for shawarma - there are probably other better-quality options out there in Mississauga.  P.S. We never got our water.... Sadness."}
{"text":"I am a lover of middle eastern food and so when I heard they opened this place I was enthused to try it as ive had my fair share of middle eastern food and missed it since moving away from downtown core and less options are availible.  I walked in stared at the menu, asked for a suggestion.. no one seemed care to give me any profound suggestion.  You would think as a new restaurant they would be excited about a customers experience.  but whatever thats fine, i asked about any eggplant dishes and the girl told me there was a eggplant dish ontop of a bed of rice.  So thats what i ordered with a yogurt drink.  After waiting 10mins take out which wasnt too long of a wait the young girl who serviced me handed me my order and said \"oh by the way it comes with bread and not with rice underneath im sorry\".  lol first of all, you dont even know your menu and after you get a customer to pay for what you describe then you tell them their order is different after its done and in a take.out bag.  lol  i laugh because it humours me that ppl can be so nonchalant. disapointing as a first experience.  and to be honest for 15$ small.portion of eggplant and a flimsy piece of bread.  Underwhelming to say the least.  Absolutely nothing \"fine\" about the taste at all.  maybe i would have given this place another shot but judging by other reviews...it looks like so far im not the only one disapointed."}
{"text":"The food here was really good the chicken tawouk was really flavorful and the kafta kabab was nice also. Garlic sauce was great!   The service was good but the annoying part was the fact that we were fasting and after a long day when you come to a nice restaurant you don't want to stand in line to order your food. There were about 10 people in line ahead of us so we had to wait in line for about 20 minutes before It was our turn to order. So it was nice that they had a set up for people who are fasting so they gave us dates and water which would've been fine to hold us over for a few min but then thankfully our drinks ($6.99 each--NOT WORTH IT) came and they also brought us bread.   The Paramount special drink was good but it definitely was not worth 699 I don't think any of the drinks are worth 599 or 699 especially the part about special it's basically the exact same as the 50-50 with the exception that they put a cup of fruit on top and some random cream and some nuts at the top which don't really make sense in the drink I definitely will not be coming back for the drinks.   The food was good and the atmosphere was nice it was nice that they had a prayer room on the side but I did feel that the food was priced a little on the pricier side and the portions were average, aka 2 people could not share a plate!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and cold, chewy food! I never write reviews but this experience was so terrible, I feel compelled to warn others to stay away.  We came here based on my boyfriend's coworker's recommendation. I'd been to a Paramount only once before (at food court in Humber River Hospital) and found my falafel sandwich from there to be mediocre, so I wasn't expecting much, but what we got was so appalling, I will never go to another Paramount again.  The girl who sat us explained they only had one salad on the menu because of the recent salmonella scare involving romaine lettuce (??). We ordered the Saj beef shawarma to which they said they ran out of the saj but that they could make it with a 9\" pita instead. Fine. The girl at the till took 3 attempts to get my order right, apologizing that it's been a long day. I paid, and she even hollered out our order to the cook in the kitchen so I figured we were good. It's sort of fast food style in this joint so I figured we would have our platter in no time, but it took 30 mins to get to our table and the restaurant was not busy. Most other tables already had their food when we ordered. After 25 mins of waiting, I got up to ask about our order and the girl said it was just in the grill press being finished off and would be plated shortly. I said, \"Ok, because I'm just about to ask for a refund; we can't wait any longer.\" 5 mins later when it did arrive, the pita was barely warm, the shawarma meat inside it was totally cold, and the fries were cold & soggy. When I asked the server about it she said, \"Well, we could redo it but I don't think you want to wait that long.\" I said, \"You bet I don't.\" I mean, how long does it take to fry up a few french fries and throw some fresh shawarma meat in a pita? She did not even attempt to apologize and said she could give me a refund. While we waited for the refund, I asked why it takes 30 minutes to fry up some french fries. The girls at the till/servers had no answer to this so I pushed on: \"Is there an explanation?\" I asked. \"Not really,\" the one girl said as she apathetically shrugged her shoulder. \"Unbelievable!\" I said. Neither of the two girls serving us seemed to care at all. Terrible customer service! Save yourself the time and money and go to an Ali Baba instead. They're cheaper, faster, tastier, and much more fresh. This place seems to try to mimic the old Montfort chain which I don't even know whether it's around anymore. That place was fantastic. This place is garbage in comparison. As another reviewer said, if I could, I'd give zero stars but Yelp forces me to give at least one."}
{"text":"Talk about being BZ, I would understand if was amazing food.  But seriously being from Detroit, It wasn't all that for me.  The best part was being with friends, and having fun.  Plus their Pita bread was fresh from oven, I usually don't like pita, but they were really good.  They took good 15 min to seat us, and a good 30 mins to bring up food.  Food wasn't bad, there was 13 ppl 6 adults, and rest kids. we spent like $100 kd"}
{"text":"Got take out while inside the store. Fries were really old and soggy. Chicken shish taouk was decent but not mind blowing. Service really can be improved. They don't tell you where to pick up your food from."}
{"text":"Looks and tasted like industrial food.  It's just ok.  Nothing extraordinary about it"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. They were super busy. The food is delish but had to wait an incredibly long time (15 minutes) for a chicken shawarma. I had a Yallah (?sp) special: fries with garlic sauce and chicken on top with parsley. Basically a Lebonese version of poutine. By the time we waited for the shawarma my food was cold. I was so hungry though....it still tasted good. The chef was very apologetic for the length of time we had to wait for take out. So only 3 stars because the service was not so great, I hope they improve on this. The food is great though. I will go again (during off peak hours)."}
{"text":"Dry chicken on the colder side... Tasteless. Prices too high. Won't come back. Useless."}
{"text":"I gonna be completely honest here!!!! The food taste GREAT!! BUT its way too expensive..one more thing the dude that makes the food just looks at me with  envy when I say \"thank you\" ...but he's  so nice to everyone else.. And I never did anything to him!! ...  Sooo rude"}
{"text":"I came in last week with my family. Was not impressed at all.   The wait for food was so long... But our drinks took even longer.   Food and beverage quality was only okay.   Only not giving 1 star because they just hired a new staff and they were training when I came in.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing especially if you don't eat meat they leave very little options. Their dips aren't good I tried hummus and tabouli. Their pita taste like cardboard and it's paper thin. I think the best thing here to get is the Basmati rice  tastes like uncles bens but triple the price. This is not middle eastern food. Don't let the appearance of the restaurant fool you"}
{"text":"Where did the service go? I've been visiting Paramount for years and years. Almost every location other than original one on Yonge street tends to disappoint me.  My wife, and 2 kids decide to visit around 2pm on Friday (pretty dead). Ordered Hummus, salad, falafal and a soup. Hummus came quickly, soup came at an ok pace, but the salad and the falafal took over 20 minutes to arrive at the table.  Asked for a bowl to split the soup with my kid - took 10 mins for a bowl, then another 10 mins for a spoon.  At this point, my 3 year old is done - and hasnt had anything to eat.  Had to get take out containers for everything. Got home, the falafal was dry (we asked for extra sauce), and salad was under seasoned.  Guys...  Get your act together.  You're in Liberty Village - with some of the pickiest customers in the city.  The franchise will bring you customers, but service will send them somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Paramount fine food restaurants at various locations. They are opening up more and more *good for them!!*  Restaurant style- I like that you can have a place to sit comfortably with a big or small group (like Fast-food style tables) but with service similar to a restaurant! When you arrive, you can be seated anywhere you would like.  Then, you can order and pay for your food at the cashier. When your meal is ready, they bring the food to your table.  We were able to sit there with a group of my friends for a long while without being kicked out of the restaurant. We even finished our meal and kept getting water refill service. The staff helped us clear our tables and etc. We use legit metal cutlery (not like plastic fast food style ones). There's no expected tip because it runs like a fast food joint.   Food- love the orders of food because it will also come with a HUGE fluffy bread called Saj bread (ordered some dipping items to go with the delicious dough we share - I think the combo platter of 3 items, Mezza place ).  The lentil soup is delicious as well.  I enjoyed the falafal  The plate of  mixed dinner portion of shawarma was yummy as well (not too dry) It was always great dining experiences with great company and good food! All the restaurants Ive been to (Downtown and North York) had great atmosphere and never too crowded. I favoured the one in North york more because i was really spacious.   I would highly recommend if you're look for quite bite or some place low key to chill with a group. This is a very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this type of food. Meats are so dry you can barely swallow it. I would only come back for their pita breads cause its freshly baked and very thin. Perfect for dipping their hummus. The salad is good too, fresh and evenly seasoned. Everything else though, i'd pass on it"}
{"text":"I had the half chicken with rice, the chicken was so over cooked it was dry & hard and not eat able...! Not the best middle eastern place but great ambiance and there mango & strawberry smoothies are to dye for."}
{"text":"there was a fucking hair in my greek salad. and the added $7 chicken skewer was only 4 pieces. and the time before this i ordered a meal and they gave me fries instead of rice"}
{"text":"I've been to this Paramount a few times and always had a good experience.   We are vegetarian so we tend to order a few of the dips that come with pita, as well as some falafels and the tabbouleh. I've also had the lentil soup which is quite comforting on a cold day.  Everything is fresh and flavourful. The staff is attentive and kind.   It's a great place for a quick healthy dinner and we come back often!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Tuesday Night and were seated fairly quickly. It might be difficult to find seating for larger groups without calling ahead.   We ordered the regular Chicken Shawarma platter, the Spinach with cheese manakeesh, and the Tabliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma.   The regular chicken shawarma platter was fairly dry on its own. We requested for spicy ketchup and tzatiki sauce. Only with the tzatiki sauce or the hot are you able to enjoy the taste.     The spinach and cheese manakeesh was okay. The spinach was pretty strong and wasn't particularly tasty but it wasn't offensive either.    The Saj Chicken shawarma was a bit more enjoyable. I'm definitely not a pickle person and the pickle in there really went well with the rest of the wrap. Be warned though.. It is pretty oily.   Overall, this was the better part of the meal.   Overall, there is quite a wait for the food and service. I definitely got hungry enough to start eating the pita itself. The shawarma is okay. I can definitely find better ones especially for the price. The place itself is a bit cramped and you are sitting quite close to other diners. I probably won't return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"We decided to order lunch from here after not eating here since my last review. We ordered a wrap and a pizza. On top of our food taking 90 minutes to arrive (instead of the estimated 45), our pizza was packed SIDEWAYS (see photos). Seriously?! The food was delicious, but we're going to stick with the Mississauga location from now on."}
{"text":"Generally really busy on Friday nights and weekends. I came here because I heard a lot of hype with the new location. I've been waiting to try the hummus and dinner menu for some time. The restaurant was super bright and had great service. We ordered the chicken hummus, yalla special(fries with garlic paste), beef wrap and a dinner plate with chicken, sirloin, rice and some veggies). We felt that it took quite some time to get our food. The first dish that came was the yalla fries which we thought was bland and the garlic paste over powered the dish. We were almost going to ask for ketchup. Then we had the hummus which I found to be mediocre. The chicken was dry and lacked flavour. Then we received the beef wrap. I thought the beef tasted like lamb which I was not able to eat. Seems as though they grilled in after the lamb. Not a pleasant taste at all. Lastly, the combination dinner plate  was probably the best thing we had. The chicken was moist and flavourful and I thought the sirloin was seasoned well. Overall, I would only come back for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food is very good especially the hummus. But I have to say this location is just too hecktic. We got sat down but because they haven't gotten their sections sorted out we were left unattended for a while before we got a server at our table. The seating is also very, very tight - so the seating wasn't very comfortable.  I would come back because the food is very good. But I think next time I mighy just het take out."}
{"text":"The saving grace was the really delicious free bread. Our party of 4 almost requested a 2nd refill of the bread...but unfortunately we did not. Many regrets to this day.   I had the 9\" chicken shawarma with a side of fattoush salad and a can of pop (it was around $12-15, can't exactly recall - this is the combo price). The 9\" shawarma is the \"large\" wrap - and it was definitely underwhelming in terms of size and flavour. The chicken was dry-ish and there was a glaring lack of sauce. I like my foods saucy and this definitely didn't deliver. Flavour was okay. The fattoush salad was again, OK. The veggies were decently fresh and the dressing reminded me of Greek salad.   For what I paid, the portion size seemed lacking. My friends meals also looked lack lustre. If they sold their bread, it would probably be the only thing I'd buy."}
{"text":"My favourite Mediterranean restaurant to order from. I've ordered from here a couple of times through Uber Eats and haven't been disappointed. My order is always prepared how I like it and delivery is fast. I always get the falafel wrap with a side of tabbouleh salad which are both so delicious! I've also tried this shrimp kabob dinner which was also tasty (but the falafel wrap is by far my favourite). I only wish they had a location near me."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I'm so glad I came here. It's a vibrant and modern looking restaurant with lots of seating to dine in. Anyways, we were seated right away to the table of our choice and were gotten drinks right away. The waitress seemed nice enough, was prompt with bringing our appetizers and main dishes, and checked in on us once or twice.  To start off, we had the hummus with pita on the side and lentil soup. Let me tell you, that lentil soup was to die for--the perfect thick consistency and the flavour (especially once you squeeze lemon onto it) was on point. I also enjoyed the hummus and I think we finished a whole basket of pita lol. And just to give the pita some limelight here, it was the best pita I've ever had, hands down--warm, thin enough to dip into the hummus yet thick enough to break apart to put food inside. Also love that it's made fresh (that's what I was told anyways). The main dish, \"the mixed grill\", was good; the falafel we ordered on the side were decent (not the best I've tasted but certainly not the worst); and the portion size was huge and really a bang for your buck. I honestly couldn't finish my main dish and probably only got a few bites in before I couldn't eat anything else.   All in all, I really enjoyed the food; the service was good; and the restaurant looked clean, spacious and presentable so I'd definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel sandwich. Big mistake. The falafel was so insanely salty that I had to throw half of it away. It's been 14hrs and I'm still experiencing thirst from all the salt I ingested. Also, they only have tahini sauce. They don't use any humus on the pita , no garlic sauce ,no hot sauce.  No option of whole wheat pita. It's more than basic and super salty. It costs  $7 90. It's quite big in size which is great, but the quality is the worst I've ever had. For a reputable establishment,this is very disappointing"}
{"text":"Mixed plated and spicy sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. Not to Raw and not over cooked. As a Muslim, I eat a lot of middle eastern food so believe me when I say it's top notch. Baklawa was moist and fluffy, not dry and flaky. Wish we had one of these in the states.   Side note. They have a prayer room!!!MashaAllah!!"}
{"text":"The literal only reason I even come here is the food is good. But to be honest, that's not even enough for me to deal with the consistent bad service.  It takes at least 10 minutes for a host/was to even come to the front to seat you. Then after placing your order it takes  ridiculously long time to just get your drinks. Then apps and food come at the same time  Not to mention I've ordered ( or tried to order their food) from skip the dishes. They weren't confirming the order. Took 30 mins to find out their tablets were down. ( because I had to call them and even then they were rude). Anyhow, not going to be eating here or ordering from them again ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere with the wall-waterfalls and Afghan music just brings me back. Extremely kind and good looking wait staff. Mixed grill is to die for."}
{"text":"I have had a consistently  positive experience  at Paramount. Respectful service. Delicious food. Fresh ingredients.  Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Paramount Fine Foods on Yonge Street.  But today I decided to try the Liberty Village one.  I used the remainder of my Ritual credit here.  Which was great because through the Ritual app, I was able to preorder my food for pick up and got to use a Ritual Exclusive Perk which gave me a discount on a food item that was regularly more in price.   You can do the same and if you use my code \"Jenny1354\", you'll get $10 to try this app.    Anyways the restaurant was quite nice and clean (and new).  It wasn't busy.  So the 2 staff members greeted me and were super friendly. Even went to check on the status of my food to rush it through.  The had some high tables/stools where you can sit and wait at.  They offered free tea while waiting.  Service wise, it was fantastic.  I couldn't have asked for better.    Food wise, a bit disappointed.  The take out dishes we got were both platters.  It felt that the portion was not well done.  I had 6 huge falafels on my platter (check out my pics) but perhaps a tablespoon of lettuce, one slice of tomato and a few pickled items.  I'd would had rather only have 3 falafel's (they were tasty and well made) and more lettuce/tomatoes, or even some rice/potato or even tabbouleh.  The pita was good.  I received 2 of the small containers of hummus dip/sauce but no garlic sauce.  One of each would had been better.  I think a side of spicy sauce would had been nice to add.     They did include sufficient napkins and fork/knife with my pick up order which was nice.  It was in a nice take out container with a bottom plate that was paper so then compostable/recyclable."}
{"text":"Great place to share food and chit chat. Went there for lunch and it was packed. Six of us were seated promptly however it's odd that you have to order/pay first at the counter. There is a tip jar if you feel like tipping after your meal. Staff was friendly and always smiling. As for the food we ordered hummus (approx$6), veggie pizza($5.99), lamb plate ($18.99), mixed meat plate ($20.99) and falafel(0.99). Chicken was a bit dry for me but the lamb and beef skewers were good. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I personally really like the falafel sandwich. But maybe it's just that I Ike being able to get a falafel sandwich a stone's throw from home. I have never been a fan of shawarma, but the beef shawarma seemed really dry to me. Giant bubble pita bread comes free to every table so I always get some hummus to go along with it, although the hummus is a little bland compared to some I've tasted. The place is always packed at lunchtime, and I keep going back, so it must be pretty good.  Service is lovely. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Paramount before (their Thornhill location, with a big group of family) and that experience sucked, so I didn't have high hopes. Let's see how this one would be.  (disclaimer: I only ate here because they had a deal with the Ritual app where a few items were listed at half price for your first Ritual order from them)  What I ordered: Beef and Chicken Dinner Plate (with rice, salad, tahini, garlic sauce, and a pita) - $15.99 ($8 with the Ritual deal)  The experience was actually a lot better than the other location, but it depends on the aspect you're focused on.  Service: C- The estimate they have noted in Ritual is \"usually ready in 10 minutes\". I ordered and they said it would take 15. Fine. I arrive exactly at the 15 minute mark and still had to wait another 11 minutes. THE WHOLE POINT OF RITUAL IS TO GIVE ACCURATE PREP TIMES. YOU CAN PICK WHATEVER NUMBER YOU WANT. If you need 20 min, or 25 min... just select that! Then people will leave home/work accordingly, to time that out. I don't need a server walking up to me every 3 or 4 min with a \"it will be a few more minutes, sir.\"  This was all compounded by the fact they were pretty dead. Two tables of people, but both already had their food. Two people were waiting for their order when I walked in. That's not a lot of business. Plus I used an app where they get to SPECIFY how long they need, and they still failed to meet it.  Food: B+ I've harped on this place before (both the service and food at their other location were underwhelming) but my experience food-wise was actually pretty good this time. I was very full by the time I was done. The chicken and beef were both juicy and flavourful (the beef was the better of the two) and the rice was plentiful and nice, although I needed to add salt/pepper to help give it flavour. The pita was large and actually quite fresh.  My complaints: the salad was boring. It was basically just shredded lettuce with two spears of pickle and turnip on the side. No dressing. That's not a salad. I can shred my own iceberg lettuce at home -- that doesn't make it a \"salad\". Also, the amount of tahini sauce you get is pathetic. The amount of garlic dip was fine, but I could have used like 3x tahini sauce for the amount of food.  Value: D Every review seems to say 'overpriced', both for the quality and quantity. I'm judging this on the actual menu price... which is NOT worth $15.99. As full as I was (mostly on rice and pita bread, mind you), $18 after taxes per person for take out? Wow. I don't know if the prices were jacked up for LV, but I wouldn't pay more than $9.50 for that. I'm glad I had the 50% off deal, but I probably won't return at those prices.  Overall: B I think this is my first review breaking things down and giving letter grades lol, but I felt it was needed to differentiate the fact the food itself was rather pleasant, but the customer service and value was not.  Conclusion: I won't likely go back because it would be twice the price, and it's not worth that. If they want my business, they'd need to lower their prices. Which they won't."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I went to Paramount many years ago when they first opened in Mississauga and the portions and food was fantastic. Today I received very bland food that was overpriced and the server did not bring us bread or water. Will not return."}
{"text":"The food is just ok.   The original paramount far outshines any of the other locations.  When a friend asked me how it was after, I equated it to being the equivalent of McDonald's for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Amazing interior & exterior design and the service has always been wonderful. The food is delicious, fairly priced and a generous portion! Would and have recommended this place! My favorite item is the shawarma"}
{"text":"With a name like Paramount...  Yummy but chincy.  Probably the slimmest pita wrap I've ever seen.  Even with my airport employee discount I felt a little ripped off.    You can tell that the ingredients are all fresh and all carry a unique flavor you can taste.    Fortunately, I just forgot my lunch for the day and just wanted to try this restaurant.  I've had falafel before and know of many other places so I'm 8n no rush to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Having lived in the region for a while, I am very familiar with authentic Middle Eastern food and am therefore rather finicky when it comes to reviewing establishments which claim to serve \"authentic Arab food.\"  This place is excellent, beyond a doubt. 1) They import Barbican, a fake-beer malt/fruity beverage, which is only sold in the Middle East. They are the only location in Toronto and probably in the whole of Ontario to do so. 2) The have all kinds of zatar and it tastes great (only complaint....they didn't put enough of zatar on my labneh zatar. Don't be so stingy next time guys!) 3) Their food is DELICIOUS! I got kibbeh, baklava, labneh zatar, chicken shwarma platter, and a barbican and happily ate it all after trudging home on the metro laden with bags of food. Cost: $30....but hey, nothing like the taste of my old home.   I would NOT get the chicken shwarma platter again even though it was tasty....... this platter is basically a DIY chicken shwarma kit....go with the shish tawook platter instead or just get the shwarma wrap and a side of fries."}
{"text":"Food is ok... but if you are on a tight time line don't come. Place was empty but food took forever to come out"}
{"text":"I have been to other paramount locations and enjoyed it; however , we decided to have paramount at Yorkville yesterday was a big mistake. We were very disappointed about everything : the service and the food. The service was very slow despite the restaurant was not that full when we went on a Thursday night. We got seated right away and ordered our food within a few minutes . We ordered a wrap and a salad with shawarma plate, simple stuff and should be fairly fast to prepare . We waited for 30-40 mins and I finally got the waiter's attention and was going to ask him about the status of our order. He asked me if we are ready to order ... No, well you took our order 30 mins ago , so yeah, they totally forgot about the order. We wait for another 5-10 mins for the food. The food finally came and I was very disappointed at the potion , to add shawarma on the salad costs $4.99 but it was only a few small piece of shawarma chicken on it. The portion of the salad was very little, not worth that much at all. I normally don't leave a bad review but I was really disappointed with this place. I don't think I would not go back or recommend it . :("}
{"text":"I've been to several Paramount's before and enjoyed the food and service. This location was disappointing. The service - while they were trying - was subpar and the food was not good at all. I'm not sure why this is so inconsistent with other locations. I had assumed they just opened but that was not the case."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to Paramount for middle eastern food last week, and it was okay but nothing special. It was busy and a little loud, but we were seated right away near the front, and the service was also pretty quick. I was facing the front window, so never really noticed much about the inside of the restaurant. It was clean though, and the lighting a little dim which is understandable for a late dinner.  The menu has a good variety, shawarma and falafel and wraps plus a few combination platters and manakeesh (similar to pizza). I had the grilled spicy sausage with rice, while my friend had chicken (shawarma I think but it may have been some other type), and both meals came with mixed pickles and pita bread. Overall, the food was okay but nothing to rave about. The sausage was spicy and the rice was nicely cooked but just plain white rice. I have eaten at other middle eastern restaurants, and I have had better but also worse.  I did not have to pay the bill, but I recall most of the main course meals were about $13-20, the wraps a little less. My friend and I had been there before with other people, and I would certainly return with them, but I have other places that I would rather go if I was on my own."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new place at Yonge and Eglinton since they looked quite busy even late at night.  We ordered a recommended Sai wrap and a shawarma plate.  The food is quite good but portions are very small relative to the price.   There was not a lot of meat in the wrap or dinner plate.   Was not overly impressed-The issue is not food quality or taste since it did taste good.  Service was also quite good and efficient.  I just found pricing high for what you get and hence low value proposition.  However, given the volume of people that was there I think my opinion may be in the minority."}
{"text":"Dined in or take-out 10 times since July... Craving for grilled meats, baba ganoush, and hummus. Enjoyed almost everything there for quick bites. Average or above average for their price and nice environment. Love their Saj wraps, hope they can offer 2 rolls (less fries/rice) combo option. Nice and friendly staff"}
{"text":"My review was too long so check the pics attached. Head office you should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Man füllt sich wie in einem arabischen Land. Es ist laut, alle wuseln um einen herum, mehr leben geht nicht. Wir waren die einzigen ohne arabische Begleitung und trotzdem haben wir uns sofort wohl gefüllt. Das Essen ist sehr frisch und lecker. Hier muss man mal gewesen sein."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I got to visit the only Paramount location I haven't been too.  As with all the others, it was awesome.  Not going to say much, but here's a few points:  1. Biggest location I think. A lot of seating.  2. The prices here are a dollar or so more expensive than the Yonge/Steeles location, but on par with the Yonge/Dundas location.  3. Apparently, they have a limited time chicken kofta! I would've tried it, but only discovered it after I had ordered.  4. I went for the crayons and colouring pages. I admit it.  5. Two weeks later, my friend Gayle calls me. The convo goes a little something like this:  Gayle \"Abbas..what did you put in my purse after Paramount?\"  Me \"Me? Oh nothing. What do you mean?\"  Gayle \"Why is there like every colour of the rainbow crayon in my purse?\"  Me \"Wasn't me\"  Gayle \"Oh really, then why is there also a colouring page coloured in and signed \"ABBAS AH-MAZING\"   Awkz.    :)"}
{"text":"Paramount is amazing.  This is their newest location (been here about 2 years or so I think) in Thornhill, like one block north of Steeles.  It's my favourite location to come to, because it's never super cramped like the downtown location. It's really spacious with lots of seating, and lots of deserts to think about while you eat!  Everything is delicious. I've never not liked anything here.  Be warned, the portions are huge..so you'll have a lot to take home. I suggest if your in a group, to get a few mixed grills and share, family style.  Tres Magnifique!"}
{"text":"I've had to take two star away from this location of paramount because the last few times have just been a bit sub-par.   I've spoken to a lot of my friends about this (we are all p-mount fanatics (also, we call it p-mount so that should tell you hardcore we are about this place) ) and they all seem to agree.  The thing with this location is that it's the busiest, so sometimes a lot of details are missed or they try to cut corners.  For instance, I was here last week with two friends, and we ordered the hummus, mixed grill and chicken shawarma plate to share. The food came in less that thirty seconds and you can tell it had been chilling on the pass or whatever for atleast ten minutes, as everything was a bit cold.  The fries were soooooooooooo cold and inedbile, its the first time I've ever had to return something at paramount. I felt so ashamed.   On the other hand, the meats even though cold, were still awesome. It still has the best shish tawook i've ever had in my life. Its really really good.   But the server was awesome! She was super sweet and fixed our fries issue right away. All the other food was great.  It's always little issues like this at just this location. Other locations, especially the thornhill location are much much better.   Hands down my fav is the thornhill location, so there's that.  But its not like I wont ever come back. my friends and I are ALWAYs in this area, and tihs is one of the few places where I can basically satisfy all my firends needs who complain (halal, vegetarian, idiots, picky eaters, etc)  Sorry I had to do this to you P-mount-poo, I still love you though. Please fix yourself and then I won't cheat on you, I promise."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...not up to the hype I got from my friends. The food was tasty but nothing special versus other Lebanese and Mediterranean food in town.  We got hummus dips, pickled grape leaves and chicken plate.  Not sure if I will return.  Food: 3/5, it was just ok. The pita was probably the best part as it was warmed up.  The rest of the food was average and some that were too sour.  Service: 2/5, not the best and the server didn't know much about the menu and not very attentive.  Ambience: 1/5, the tables are too close together and not enough space for foot traffic so you have to be careful or people will be walking behind your seat constantly.  It's also really loud so not great for dinner conversation.  Price: 2/5, too expensive for what it's worth - came to around $20 per person: Ali baba or greek town messini may be better."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and made to order, but the mushrooms were rubbery and probably out of a can. Maybe just get a pepperoni next time."}
{"text":"we had the kafta and shish tawouk dinners, with fries and substituted tabouli salad for a side. both meat dishes are quite good - not very spicy tho.   pretty nice place in the inside, although passing by I would have never walked in until a co-worker recommended it. big suggestion for better marketing: put the pita bread flipping guy by the window front! He's quite skilled with the long wooden flipper and he's hidden in the back. the big fluffy fresh pitas are a great selling point and the guy that does it should be featured by the window. (think the crepe place on queen street - they let you see the crepes being made - and nothing beats the smell of fresh pastry, would attract so many more customers!)  anyway, food was good. I'd preferred more salad/veggies and less fries/rice. plus we get two additional pita breads - it's a lot of carbs.   would probably come again and try something else."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Paramount Fine Foods. I've only visited this location but I've been there twice and both times the food was superb.   The service is ok, with waiters being slightly awkward but polite. The vibe is friendly Lebanese, with some subtle Arabic music in the background and nice decor upstairs (I like the high ceiling and vibes). The prices aren't cheap but the food holds up.  On to the food: their hummus with lahme (meat) is delicious and a good portion for 3 people to share as an appetizer. The second you place your order, they bring 2 freshly baked, inflated pitas to your table. Love this! Pairs perfectly with the hummus. For our mains, we got one lamb kebab sandwich, one shish taouk sandwich (pieces of tender chicken breast) and I ordered the shawarma (beef) saj, which is a very thin crepe-like bread rolled around tender and succulent shawarma. This was served with fries and pickles and was mouth wateringly good.   We also tried the mango-strawberry cocktails, yummy! Give this place a try for some delicious Lebanese food in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Relatively new location very conveniently located beside the St. Lawrence Market. I've been meaning to review this site for a while since I've been here sooo many times already since it first opened. Tonight I went again for dinner and the copious amount of ice shavings in my grape leaves prompted me to finally write a review.  Long story short, this is a new site, so the venue is impeccably clean and new-looking, but the staff/service is not up to par (yet, hopefully). The first time we came here for lunch, a server accidentally spilled half a glass of water on my partner. The next few times we were here, service was inconsistent and nonexistent at times. No one to take our orders, no one to check on us or to refill our waters, no one to give us the bill (eventually we walked up to the counter - yes, be proactive here instead of wait for eons like we silly fools did). It became a running thing for my partner and I to casually observe and comment on whether we think service has improved since the last time. To be fair, I honestly feel that they are trying hard to make the dining experience as positive and smooth as possible. The manager (I think that's who the non-uniformed man is?) would personally check on us the last few times and the servers have great attitudes despite us having to repeat or correct our orders sometimes. So maybe the problem is that they are understaffed?  In terms of food, I know some Yelpers have complained about the food here vs at the Dundas location. I honestly taste and see no difference in the amount (still big portions) or quality. The food here is what you can expect at any Paramount. However, my entire grape leaves were filled with ice shavings (amongst other ingredients) tonight, so I had to bring that up to the server. That's not really ok; I thought the kitchen could have been a bit more careful to thaw my grape leaves before serving.   The venue is much less crowded than at the Dundas site even on weekend evenings, so this location might be more preferable if you want more quiet, have a bigger group, or didn't make a reservation.  Food 4/5 - what you would expect at any Paramount. not many main options for vegetarians, but plenty of options for appetizers (which can be meals) Value 5/5 - cheap! complimentary/unlimited pita bread will fill you up if you prefer to just order one or a few appetizers as the main Service 2/5  Venue 5/5 - spacious, quiet, clean, bright"}
{"text":"Super convenient location to grab breakfast/lunch/dinner if you're in the Eaton centre area, in a rush, don't want to spend too much $, but also don't want to resort to the dozens of fast food joints nearby, e.g. Burger King.  I love Middle Eastern food and I think Paramount (all the locations I've been to so far) does a pretty decent job in terms of food prep and delivery. Also really good value (I spend no more than $10 here usually) and very filling! Portion sizes are quite large and you are almost guaranteed to leave full since there's so much use of olive oil, hummus, etc. Lots of vegetarian and dairy-free options.   Paramount now post calorie counts in their menus; although as of last week this location has not done so yet.  This location has significantly better service vs the Front Street location and here they have a cooler (but older) looking venue with an upstairs balcony. Sometimes this location does fill up though and can get quite loud!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma plate for my lunch, portion is not ok, the chicken is dry due to they put a piece of wrap/pita underneath the chicken for it to look that there's a lot of portion,also gave little bit of rice."}
{"text":"I have been to both the Crestlawn location and the Young Street location. I like the young street one more because:  1. it is bigger  2. the owners and service are definitely more attentive  3. I go to the Young street for gatherings more than just a quick bite  But at both places the food is great, I always go for the shawarma plates with the meat/pita/rice with a side of hummous and always hot sauce. (One of the awesome girl at the young St location came by to refill my hot sauce =D)  Both places have given me free desserts to try every time I go, I love this one dessert with an orange substance on top, warm it up before eating (YUMMERS)  Their non alcoholic beer is also pretty good! Their pizzas are cheap starting from $3, and the plate is always big enough for me to share with a friend so it is $11-$13 between two of us.    It is a order at the counters and they bring it to your table type establishment.  Tip: Pita bread is made fresh and just so soft and different from other ones."}
{"text":"I was very excited for paramount to open a location near my house. We have eaten in the restaurant many times and have also had it UberEats to our house before. Haven't been disappointed yet. Their lentil soup and pita chips are delicious!"}
{"text":"I've visited their downtown location and was pleasantly surprised that this location was even better. They have a all-out dessert section with so many mouth-watering treats. Aside from that, the shawarma is just as good and they give you so much of it that it will be difficult to finish!  The only gripe would be finding seating as the place is also very busy on evenings so plan to arrive early!"}
{"text":"If you decide to go their for lunch on Fridays, be sure to arrive early or late as it is very busy at peak hours, especially if you plan to bring a large group. Although crowded, the atmosphere is great. Be sure to get an order of humus to go with the pita bread that they constantly bring to your table.  I ordered the beef and chicken shawarma platter and was barely able to finish it. Very large portion and very delicious  Overall, a great place to visit if you can manage to find a table."}
{"text":"Never had a worse shawarma before. Both quantity and taste are very bad. Would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"For the price, the food really isn't what it should be. For my husband and I to order two beef and chicken plates, we could almost order steak dinners for ourselves at another restaurant. The portion sizes were not large. I have had more elsewhere. I specifically asked for no pita and when I started to eat I noticed a pita on the base of my plate. The ambience is very much like a cafeteria, so don't expect a nice sit down place. The ambience is fairly loud and informal. The food quality itself was not the best. The meat was fatty, the rice was bland and we had maybe a teaspoon of garlic sauce on the side. I'll be honest, you can find better not far away."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Paramount for a number of years. It is a great place for Lebanese style mid-eastern food. They have plenty of vegetarian choices and we've tried them all. They are all very good starting with their creamy hummus, smoky baba ghanoush, hot pita from the oven, tangy lentil sauce & tangier grape leaves, etc.. A great family atmosphere too - good for large groups. Cons- reasons for 4 star & not 5: 1. Their plates & flatware are not very clean - many times I've sent them back. They need to pay attention to dishware being clean.  2. The environmentally conscious part of me has one issue - they use a lot of styrofoam & plastic which I don't see being recycled. They need to reduce the waste & move to wash & re-use containers keeping the above containers for take-away."}
{"text":"Portions are small. Falafel wrap was cold and certainly not fresh. Manekeesh (cheese) hot amd freah. Not worth the money. Staff was friendly. Fast service...but thats probably bc the foods not fresh."}
{"text":"I found the service here horrible. They seated us in a crowded area even though half the restaurant was empty. And the whole concept of paying and tipping before you even experience the food and service was mind boggling. Food came as we ordered but with very little meat and staff barely cared if you had a good experience or not. They seemed to care more about socializing with one another than the customers. Also, did I mention that I found a piece of black plastic in my food"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite location in terms of the quality of the food, it never disappoints. I always order the shish tawook and it is to die for! However, like other reviews, the service isn't the greatest. The staff is a little disorganized and it takes a while for them to bring out your order"}
{"text":"I'm not exactly a Middle Eastern food expert but I had a pleasurable experience at Paramount fine food and would definitely dine again at this chain.   The system was a bit abstract as you had to wait to be seated and had to go up to the cash to order. I really liked their menu too. We went with the chicken tabliyeh Saj wrap and a mixed combo platter which and assortment of items that included: beef and chicken shawarma, kofta, beef skewer and shish tawouk. Both items included some pickles and garlic sauce (which was amazing)   The food was hot, fresh, and tasty. You could see the cooks making all the food over the front counters. The meats were grilled well but the common complaint here seems to be that the meats are on the dry side and I find myself agreeing. However, it's was not too bad and it was still enjoyable. The pita was piping hot and was surprisingly good. It tasted amazing with the hummus which was excellent and we just ate it with absolutely everything.  One minor problem I found while I was writing this review was that we might have been given the short end of the stick in regards to the mixed combo platter. The menu said there would be falafel, but we didnt get any. We didn't realize because we were all so hungry and didn't notice. I'm also not quite sure where the hummus came from, while I thought we were supposed to get fattoush. Probably the combo platter gives you all these extras which is kind of nice since you don't have to add all these.   Service was fine for this kind of restaurant. We didn't need to wait too long for food, were checked in at least once, and had our waters refilled too."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken plate that I had was good. Service was good and I appreciated the fact that we were asked by the manager if the food was good. I saw the piles of different baklava and wished that I stayed behind to try some. Next time!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The best place to get seated would definitely be on the second floor towards the big chandelier. The ambiance is more intimate and romantic compared to the first floor where the ambiance is more casual. The shish tawouk was really good and the baklavas were even better! I really like how every table gets served these giant, pillow-like pita breads - definitely very useful for grabbing pieces of salad or rice from your plate! I would say that the one thing Paramount needs to improve on would be their service. After waiting almost 20 minutes to get seated, we had to wait an additional 5 minutes to get our menus and it took even longer to get water at our table."}
{"text":"The lamb skewers are pretty good although not cheap. Also wish they would cook them medium instead of well done.  The pita is always fresh and delicious.   I find the take out ordering protocol at this and their other locations bizarre. Walk to the back of the restaurant through all the tables to order and then stand in the middle of the restaurant to wait for your food. Why not keep the take out customers near the front and out of the way?  Plus they have been pretty inefficient at times with managing the takeout orders with the guys do the cooking also having to figure out who gets what.   I have never eaten in so can't comment on table service. If I can't get a beer with my meal why would I sit there. LOL."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night and we had just arrived in Toronto a few hours earlier. Yonge Street was alive with chaos and we were on the hunt for a bite to eat. We peered into Paramount and were drawn in by the cool space and Middle Eastern cuisine. The place was packed although we managed to snag a good table on the upper balcony area. Paramount was packed with a variety of tourists and locals. The service however was chaotic and hurried for much of the evening.   I wasn't looking to order a ton of food and I was having trouble on deciding what to order. I was looking around at other tables to try and make up my mind. I went ahead with the Falafel plate which came out super quick. The falafel was good however once the rest of our food came out, I realized that the Chicken Shawarma  plate was my favorite. We were very tempted to order dessert however we decided against it.  As the night went on, the service did become somewhat more attentive. It seemed that we had multiple servers which made things a tad confusing. Overall, I'd really rate Paramount at a solid 3.5 stars. I have to knock them for the service and sense of feeling rushed to order. However, in the spirit of generosity and because of the great food and very cool space, I'm granting them 4 stars. I'd certainly return the the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Staggeringly horrible service.  Arrived, waited an hour to find out they had no chicken or beef or rice!  Whoever owns this brand should shut this place down stet"}
{"text":"an Uber Eat's review so won't comment on the set up itself. Our order was fast and accurate which is always great, the portions are huge, one of the mixed combo's with an additional shish tawouk skewer was good for 2 people. (I'd have loved a little more salad but meh there was tons of food and lots of the so good pita) easy to add on extra sauce, just be sure you know which ones you like. I'd say this is great for when you want something a bit more healthy and that travels well. I'd order again (and will really soon) plus to be fair I like the fact the company is involved in the community. Nice to support local success stories!"}
{"text":"Jan. 25. Approx 1500hrs. Belly grumbling. My order: Chicken Sharawma and the Kofta Sandwich.   No upgrades, additions or deletions.  Restaurant comped me two fresh pieces of pita bread. Nice touch.  Must read:  While in line to order and pay, look to your left. You will see the oven chef working it. Today I observed This serious Shia LaBeouf looking dude Skillfully Tossing in pizzas, cheese covered breads and what almost floored me, a dirty ripped pair of latex gloves straight into the oven. I kid you not my people. Unless these gloves were the secret spice that gives the baked items at this restaurant its special mouthwatering, let's all bring the fams here for dinner, line ups out the door glorious reputation.  WTH?!?  Latex allergies anyone?  I have absolutely no to reason to bad mouth this amazing restaurant but when I saw that.  DAMN. Who does that?  Seriously, Who Does That?  To report or not to report?  Looking  around me at all the beautiful families with young children and babies smiling and laughing while eating their food.   Management of Paramount, consider a lateral movement for this employee.  Dishwasher or waste disposal dude not Baked Goods Chef.   I still ate both sandwiches praying that the pita was not baked in the same oven by our friend Shia LaBeouf.   My final on the two sandwiches ordered:  Delicious with hints of I am gonna be sick."}
{"text":"Typically I really like paramount. And I was very excited for this to open in my area. This location is shit though. Not sure how the food could be this much worse at this location. Get it together paramount!"}
{"text":"Not sure about all of the negative reviews here.  I have ordered takeout from this location three times and have not had an issue.  The only complaint I might have is that they ask you to stand right in front of the kitchen area around the servers pass to wait for your food after you order, which to me is pretty awkward. I know just stand by the sweets area to get out of the way.  Typically I order the lentil soup, greek salad, hummus, and falafel plate. All have been delicious every time I ordered.  I did also notice the last time I visited that the prices have increased slightly."}
{"text":"I enjoy Paramount and find the quality of the food to be consistent at all of their locations.  Visited with my work colleagues and enjoyed my meal. I opted for my usual falfel platter along with a Paramount special drink - so good!  This location seems to be super busy but we had our food super quickly with no complaints."}
{"text":"I really like their hummus here, it is so so so creamy!  My mom is a very big fan as well, and she goes here often for lunch as she works just across the street.  Usually I will order extra pickles and those cray pink turnips with my meal - can't get enough! My go to meal is normally some type of chicken skewer dinner, very tasty!  Try one of their \"pizzas\" - pretty much a thin pita with various toppings, very good!   I love to order a selection of desserts here to go, tiny baklava type bites, yummers!!  Prices are pretty reasonable as well, and for the downtown core, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Great middle Eastern food chain that is now scattered across the GTA. Their food is quite tasty and there is a wide variety. I tend to stick to the salads or plates when i go, but I have heard the rest of their food is equally as good."}
{"text":"It is a shame this location has yet to listen to their feedback. I've been to other locations and it is not the same. THE PORTIONS PEOPLE. I just ate a chicken shawarma at $8.49 that tasted like I was eating pickles and sauce. I love the food so it's hard to write a bad review but you would think after all these reviews, they would make a change. Hey! If you're not going to help yourself, then so be it."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and well served. The Manakeesh is fantastic, and so is the Kafta. Be sure to try those!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad relate to price. The bread is very good and you can have as many as you want. Will come back for next York sale visit."}
{"text":"Best hummus and middle eastern food in the area. Have come here multiple times and each time the flavors have been excellent. They've nailed the food and service. Surprised yelp rating was only 3.5."}
{"text":"This is a new place which has an older branch in Mississauga. It is huge, attractive and very clean.  As you enter on your left there is a long counter where all the sides and appetizers are displayed in clear plastic containers. They also have a display of various specialty drinks/fruit mixtures (Lebanese style). In the back they have a huge assortment of middle eastern pastries and a full blown coffee station for preparing various coffee.  You sidled up the long counter and order what you want. Last night we ordered a whole grilled butterflied chicken, a plate of chicken shawarma, a plate of beef, a fatoosh, some baba ganoush, and some taboula. We also ordered on of the above specialty concoctions.  You then proceed to you table which is numbered, and wait for the food to be brought over. On a serving station for the clients there are thermal pitchers of cardamon spiced coffee available on a complimentary basis. They do not serve water in glasses, only in bottles which I found not so cool.  The first thing that is brought to your table are hot, just baked pitas, that look like volleyballs. All pitas look 'inflated' when the are hot...we are just used to seeing them flat.  The appetizers, which are plentiful portions are then brought over. They were delicious especially the baba ganoush and the taboule. The bread was outstanding. I had not had fresh, hot pita in years.  The main course were tasty and LOADED with sides including the best turnip pickles I have ever had (Mom if you are reading this from somewhere I apologize). All sides are served with rice, pickle, tomatoes, parsley, and lots of pickles including cucumber torchis. And then they give you plentiful garlic mayonnaise to complement everything. This will ensure that no vampire accost you.  We were 4 healthy eaters, and the portions cried for take-out. They have a wide variety of other offering which we saw being carried to other tables. They looked yummy. They also offer $ 49.00 family platters of gargantuan proportions. You can choose one meat or have meat assorted. Those look like the would feed 5/6 people.  We took out some dessert for one of our kids, but I had sampled those previously and they are delicious.  I was tempted to give this restaurant one less star, but the taste drove me upwards. Its 4.5 stars the penalty coming from no water and no service. But looking at it another way tipping is not expected. After eating the leftovers and thinking about it I have removed the .5 Star 'penalty' and made this place a 5 Star!  The whole meal cost us $ 75.00 and it was really good....Try it...or try their Mississauga branch."}
{"text":"What we ate:  - Kebbeh  - Musaaka  - Tabbouleh   - Mixed Grill - Moutabbal   Food was solid and service was extremely fast. The Tabbouleh was especially good - it was crisp without being too crunchy and had the perfect amount of acidity (definitely not overly oily at all). Very fresh.   The mixed grill was satisfying. The kebbeh was the only below average thing we ate. The filling was a bit dry and didn't work well with the crispy outside. A bit too oily but still did the trick. Moutabbal was fantastic."}
{"text":"About as authentic as KFC is to Southern Cooking. The Shawarma is dry due to being pre cut so early in the day.  Bland and tasteless.  Also had to return it for more toasting.  The press was barely on.  Left it on for quite a well and still wasn't long enough. Service was non existent and had to yell for someone to attend the counter.  Everyone commenting about this place is right.  It's not good."}
{"text":"I love this addition to the Erin Mills Area.  A big fan of their puffy breads and the hot sauce dip!!  Their food is also good - good low key atmosphere for casual dining"}
{"text":"Friday dinner time and place was crowded. Staff friendly enough, place looked clean. Ordered 2 chicken and beef shawarma plates to go, 10 minute wait. Both the shredded chicken and beef were dry, over cooked. Very little salad and veggies. Loved that both sauces were on the side, separate. Surprised to find half a pita on the bottom of all the food, I guess to absorb all the oil. Two warm fresh out of the oven pitas included with each plate which was the best part. Overall, it was okay but at $16.99, on expensive side."}
{"text":"Amazing food! A great halal food venue complete with a kids play area and prayer room. The arrangement for paying for food before eating it at a sit down venue that looks so great is a bit off-putting but other than that the food and atmosphere is really good for this side of Mississauga."}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  Once for take away another for dine in.  Both times staff were friendly and food was excellent.  Restaurant ambiance is nice as well with a huge glass water fall in the middle of the dining room.  Food arrived quickly and hot.  Extra naan bread never a problem at no extra cost. In short: clean Restaurant, friendly staff, excellent hot food.  Lots of parking or express bus stop out front to the subway."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza is amazing! Thin, crispy and the cheese is salty and buttery... sounds funny but it's really good!  My other favourite is the shish taouk with extra garlic sauce. To all you garlic lovers out there... MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Great quick bite and/or group outing destination! And here's why...  Lots of dips including Moutabbal, a smokey eggplant dip topped w pomegranate seeds, great for sharing! And their pitas are made fresh.  They also offer platters of meat off the bbq, I love eating family style.  But you don't need to go in a big group, it's also great if you're just grabbing a quick bite with a friend.   I usually stop by instead of eating at the food court when I'm shopping at the Eaton centre. Their pita sandwiches are $6-7, and they make a homemade chili sauce with chucks of peppers and onions. Yum!  I usually either get the Shish Tawouk sandwich (chicken skewers off the bbq) or the Moutabbal with a few falafels or a skewer of Shish Tawouk, always with chili sauce.  The service isn't the greatest, but the food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Motivated by strong recommendations, I decided to visit Paramount for take out on the way home today.  I went with the Beef and Chicken Shwarma plate.  It included everything you would expect - Beef, Chicken, some rice, lettuce tomatoes, tahini, etc.  It also included two large piece of Pita bread.  The food was delicious, given that I couldn't dig into it until about an hour later.  The spices were just right, although the meat was a little dry.  I think it would probably be better as a dine-in experience.  It was also plentiful.  While expensive at $11.99, I think my dish could be sufficient for two average people.  I didn't finish it.  The ordering process for take out left a bit to be desired.  The place was chaotic.    First, you order at the front, without the menu in plain sight.  You need to walk into the restaurant more if you want to see the menu, then go back to order.  More importantly, after you order they send you to a different part of the restaurant to pick up your order.  The problem with this is that the spot you're asked to stand in and wait for 10-15 minutes is a busy part of the restaurant where several bottlenecks meet, with a walkway that is too small to successfully do what they're trying to do in that space.  I was constantly dodging servers and other patrons and generally trying to find a spot where I could stand still in peace.  I'll go back, but I'll probably eat in.  Hopefully the chaos is a bit more organized, and the food will taste even better freshly served."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef shawarma platter for take out. Spent $19 on some dry beef, dry rice and very few veggies (exactly 4 pickled beets). Very disappointed for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Decent Lebanese food, somewhat touristic, nice environment, slow service.  The humus, and main courses are good.  Very cool puffy pita bread.  It's nothing too special or exceptional. A nice ethnic alternative to the other places around the Yonge & Dundas area."}
{"text":"Apparently there is this restaurant in Spain where they rely on Proustian effects to enhance the dining experience. For example, a balloon is brought to the table filled with the scent of oranges and is released slowly to evoke memories of growing up near the orange groves.   You could say the same thing about Paramount, but exchange citrus accents with buckets of cheap cologne. I'm not sure what they were going for here but the Axe-cented patrons and staff to the left and right of us made me feel like I was in Night at the Roxbury. But let's get to the food, shall we?  It felt like a rollercoaster of awesome highs and middling lows. The chicken shawarma was freaking amazing but the turnips and sides were sub par. The stuffed grape leaves were good but not great.   However, in a sea of Popeyes and Burger Kings, this place is pretty good for getting something moderately healthy."}
{"text":"The homemade hot sauce is great! You get a ton of food and the meats, hummus and falafel are super."}
{"text":"Since winning four $25 gift certificates from 680NEWS radio a few years ago, we've only been here twice to use up two of the gift certificates on their delicious desserts/sweets.  They are divine!  I think we would like to sit in and dine there next time and try their savoury side."}
{"text":"They are located in the heart of downtown Toronto.   If you are big drinker, they don't have a liquor license.  We ordered the lamb Kababs with rice. Delicious! The serving size was manageable.  Their free pita bread was fresh, puffy, and tasty...definitely the highlight of my meal.  We sat by the windows on the first floor and had a nice view of downtown Toronto's street life.  Overall it was a pleasant experience with exotic food and affordable in a awesome location."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and on both occasions I have thought, 'I really need to come here more often'.  The first time I was here with my husband and we both ordered the kafta and that was it. This time, I came with a couple of coworkers, one of which was well versed in Paramount's menu so we opted to let him select our items.  We ended up with fattoush salad, falafel, manakeesh zaatar and the mixed grill of kafta and shish tawouk. The salad is fantastic; not a complicated or sophisticated salad but what really makes this salad is the fried pita pieces that are tossed in making for an interesting texture.  Honest, I'm a tad embarrassed to say, I've never had falafel before although I'm not quite sure why. I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience and will definitely order them again. They were perfectly fried and accompanied with a tahini dipping sauce.  I'm on the fence with regards to the manakeesh zaatar... I've tried other manakeesh's before and I think I much prefer mine with meat and cheese. Nonetheless, it was tasty and had a unique texture.  The mixed grill was perfect! The kafta was as I remembered and the chicken was fresh. Everything was cooked to perfection and accompanied with a hearty helping of rice, pickled and grill veg, hummus and garlic sauce.  The restaurant is large with plenty of seating and an extensive menu.  They also have a wide range of delectable desserts teasing you from their display cases.  Definitely a great place to stop for lunch or dinner... although from what I understand, they are also open for breakfast too! Win win... win."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's nice to sit down and enjoy a meal, but be prepared to shell out quite a bit of money for your meal. While I found the food to be tasty, and enjoyable I did not appreciate the shell shock I received when I got my bill. I basically paid about eight dollars for a sandwich that is a little less than 6 inches."}
{"text":"New location in Yorkville.   I had the lentil soup and paramount' special drink, and a chicken and beef shawarma. The lentil soup was pretty good and so is the paramount special drink, which can be quite filling. I suggest only ordering that drink if you are having a light meal or just wanting that as your lunch snack. The chicken and beef shawarma was also yummy and filling as it includes a salad but I kind of thought the beef was a bit tough so I would go for full chicken next time. The real winner is the bread and garlic dip, it is to die for! So delicious!   Overall, portions are good and price is reasonable. Definitely recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow. Still crap but maybe worst when they opened. They have not adjusted their stupid ordering. Some get bread some don't. Some get water some don't. I was on the don't side. You wait quite the while for a lamb wrap but waiters laugh at the time of delivery. Why does Toronto continue to have these sub par over priced places? Now i got to go to Esquire restaurant since i am still starved. What a waste of money? This place must be a money pit of loss. Ps. Don't tip as they clearly don't get the meaning of full service."}
{"text":"The sharma is real good , taste different, you can feel the difference from ordinary sharma.  But the best thing is the Geek salad with chicken,  they will give you 2 piece for fresh bread.  Healthy food.  If you like arabic food , you shouldn't be missing this one ."}
{"text":"We've eaten there twice so far and enjoyed it so much that I will be definitely going more to enjoy their delicious food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype over this place so decided to check it out, but man was I soo unimpressed.   I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate with fries that came with veggies, a piece of bread, and garlic sauce. The bread and fries dipped in the garlic sauce was good, but that was the best part of the meal. The shawarma meat was absolutely disgusting. The portion wasn't the largest, but out of the serving provided, about 50% of the 'meat'  was chicken skin or fatty bits, which meant uneatable. I ended up throwing most of the 'chicken' out because I was tired of sorting through which parts were actually edible meat.   Food thoughts aside, the restaurant was pretty nice. Newly renovated and it showed. All the staff was helpful when I was trying to choose what to order and they gave clear descriptions of what different items were.   Overall, the food left me with a bad opinion of the place and I don't think i'll return."}
{"text":"Was there over a year ago, some of the most incompetent service I've ever had. Owner/manager spent our entire meal hitting on the two girls seated next to us as our waiter skipped from disaster to disaster. The bus people were WAY more qualified than this halfwit. Unremarkable food compared to almost any Montreal Lebanese takeout place, bar the fresh pitas which are fantastic."}
{"text":"My 9\" shawarma (which the photo led me to think would be massive, a meal in itself), was little more than a skinny finger of dry meat, comprised mostly of pita by volume.   Oh dear, Paramount. Lots of sizzle, but little to show for it. Decor is flashy, high gloss pictures of near-bursting shawarmas accompany a high tech touch screen 'photo booth' contest, all in no doubt a pricy location in Front Street.   You, the customer, pay for it all. The food is pretty much the same as any other less fancy shawarma joint - but in much, much smaller quantities. Don't expect much.   A tip, Paramount: focus on the food first. Good food is the best marketing.    Service is good."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Friday. Came in no line up, ordered my food which was a chicken shawarma and then waited 20 mins for my food.   That is RIDICULOUS 20 min for a wrap filled with pre Made chicken plus I ordered take out not dine in.   The wrap was 7 inches long and thin. It tasted average definitely not worth the wait. And they forgot my hot sauce"}
{"text":"Amidst a Sunday afternoon, I came here with some co-workers for a quick lunch. The menu is extensive, ranging from pita bread, pizza, shwarmas, skewers, and large dishes.   It was quite a little navigation for a new-comer to Paramount.  1) You seat yourself at a table. 2) Walk up to the food counter to order, stating your table number. 3) Food is brought to you at your designated spot. 4) You walk to the exit and pay at the cashier, stating your table number again.   The fresh pita bread that they bake comes out puffy and piping hot. Customers pair this with the hummus and it's definitely something I want to come back to try.   I ordered the chicken shwarma and given that I don't eat at middle eastern food often, it was new flavour combinations in my mouth, which I did find refreshing and delicious.   Note: This place can get quite busy. Service is a hit or a miss; most waitors deliver your food and you'll probably not see them again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent overall. We would go back again.  Food: pretty good, although falafel wraps were really salty. We ordered falafel wraps, zaatar/cheese manakeesh, and a chicken burger. $5.50 for a falafel seems a bit overpriced compared to some of the deals you can get on Lawrence east, but it is a nicer atmosphere here.  Service: pretty friendly and prompt. We went on a Saturday at 7pm and the place was packed. It would be a long wait if we wanted to stay so we just got take out instead. The server/cashier was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us since we had never been there before.  I'll be back to try other things on their big menu!"}
{"text":"Fab falafal! I found the experience here so overwhelming though, that I actually got my food to go and sat in the car to eat it.   I was there during the Saturday lunch rush it seemed, and it also seemed that everyone knew where to go and what to do but me. As a first time patron I would have liked a little direction. The tables were mostly full in this massive warehouse-like restaurant and lines were everywhere. I wound up just getting a falafal pita which I really enjoyed but I'm not sure if I would return and endure the stress of the place for one again. Maybe going at an off hour would be better and give me the opportunity to really peruse the menu and ask questions to the staff. We shall see."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Paramount and this location. It wasn't as good as I expected from Lebanese food. I went there with my MealPal application subscription for lunch during day. Atmosphere is pleasant, style is right but I found the portions really small.. What surprised me was with Meal Pal we are supposed the get the same size portions but it wasn't so... especially the meat part, my beef shawarma was like half of what the regular customers got, so was very disappointed with the quantity... Taste was ok, although beef part looked kind of dry and there was just very little sauce. I wouldn't go there with my MealPal account for sure, if this restaurant wants to keep serving MealPal gals it should reconsider the amount they are preparing for them..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visit Paramount frequently, we are both fans of the zataar with cheese (be warned, this is salty but flavourful) and the various manakeesh. The shawarma dinners are excellent and prices are superb. My only complaint is the food has arrived cold on a few occasions however I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Paramount for the last 4 years since I first discovered the Mississauga location. Both locations are great but the Yonge street location is where I've been going lately.  I always get the vegetarian options. This last visit was for a Saturday lunch. I ordered tabbouleh, and falafels and my companion had the lentil soup and stewed okra. Between our orders and the complimentary piping hot basket of pita bread placed on our table, we were stuffed.  This is great value for your money and the service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Gracias Iri for introducing this place to me! I've been hearing and seeing Paramount Fine Foods popping up everywhere in locations all over GTA, so it was necessary to join the movement and try some yummy Middle Eastern foods.  Coming here with Vianca (Vince and Bianca) along with Philiana! lol... I was surprised the interior, presentation of foods, and the layout of the restaurant was appealing.  Usually you'd have to go order your food and sit down until someone brings it to your table.  HOwever for Vianca and I (newbies) one of the managers ended up taking our orders and bringing the food to our table.    They provide you unlimited complimentary Pita bread straight out of the oven, so beware its pipping hot!  For the works Vince had their mini-mixed grill which had bbq beef kebobs, shish tawouk, grilled veggies, rice, (the whole works)  Bianca had their Beef and chicken shawarma plate; shredded chicken, beef, veggies, rice Iriana had their falafel sandwich! I had their chicken shish tawouk, two chicken skewers with rice and potatos.....all dishes had their signature GARLIC SAUCE which VINCE went ape-S@#$ and order a side order of more garlic sauce, but it was so good!!! the platters were well priced and portioned, but most of all the taste was yumm!!!!  Overall the place is clean, the staff are super friendly, however I do not find it too cozy, maybe its just me. This place is a 4.5!!!!!!! in my books! near-to-perfection"}
{"text":"Meeting a friend for lunch in the busy downtown district we quickly decided to come here for a nice and healthy meal to catch up over.  It was actually my first time coming to this location as this place used to be 'Supremes' back in the day.  Though the interior of this place doesn't really give off a Middle Eastern flare besides to pictures and background music its definitely a nice ambiance!  The venue has plenty of seating and is most of a all, CLEAN.  Keeping it simple yet hearty I decided to try their Chicken Shawarma plate; rather than fries I substituted it for Taboule salad.  In terms of portions, it was a lot, so much I barely finished my taboule.  Their prices are reasonable as my dish cost me approximately $15 which is decent for the area, food, ambiance, and service."}
{"text":"The food was actually better than I expected. The bread was very good. The rice was good and the falafel was good. The hummus was tasty. The service was just ok but the owner was really nice."}
{"text":"Finally there's a Paramount close to home.  This location was recently opened.  Inside the ambiance is spacious, beautiful, clean, contemporary with Arabic influences all over. The food, like all other locations is the same for the most part.  Our service was excellent: friendly, fast, efficient and knowledgeable about their menu.   In terms of food here's the breakdown:  Babaganoush: 4/5 deliciousand well portioned Hummus: 2/5 too thick, needed some additional olive oil to give it a cremier texture. Beef Manakeesh: 3/5  Spinach Manakeesh: 4/5 Mixed platter: 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is spacious and great for kids. They have people walking around making sure you know what you are doing when you go in. Basically you sit first, ponder the menu at the table, then go to the front to order. You give them you table # and food will be brought.  I had the Shish Tawouk which is basically two skewers of chicken breast with french fries. This was delicious. They bring around puffed up bread; I'm assuming you can get more if you ask but they bring you two.  The Moutabbal is this smokey eggplant spread. It has a huge smokey flavor and is delicious.  They also have this kids play area, delectable sweets for dessert and at the end you pay. Oh, and try the Zateer Manakeesh which is thyme and sesame sead on a flat bread. Delish!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and hard workers staff. Nice menu, lots of options for savoury, desserts and drinks. Clean restaurant, organized, good illumination and very good location."}
{"text":"So this is the better Paramount location from my humble opinion. It's pretty standard as far as Arab food is concerned but I really enjoyed the hummus here. I would return if they kick it up a notch - this is what happens when you have a client base relying on you for a quick turnover and ample selection.   Deff worth a visit yo'."}
{"text":"Everything about the food was bad. The taste, texture, freshness, and quality. It's also expensive and left me bloated with heartburn. I'd really give it a 1.5"}
{"text":"We've been 8-9 times & continue to love the food. Fresh flavours. Have never left feeling hungry. Friendly staff & good prices. My only complaint would be the disposable cups & plates when eating in.  Some stuff comes on real plates & cups, it wouldn't cause any trouble to do all the same. It would save them money & the environment to serve all eat-in meals on real dishes. Otherwise we always look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. Service is exceptionally slow giving the impression that food is being freshly prepared, but it's always cold by the time it arrives. There's always something wrong with the food. Chicken is invariably dry as all hell. The lamb was burnt and overly salty once, but completely unseasoned another time. Rice is always bland. Portions are small. They need proper kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Very expensive and very poor portions, i was so disappointed that I decide never again to visit this place and it was one of my favorite! Everything looks fancy and beautiful but the quality of food, prices and  service was horrible! Chicken shawarma dinner, order of falafel and tabouleh was 29.89$ which is ridiculous because you are paying  almost thirty bucks for pickled turnip, fries and a garlic sauce...meat was barely visible and it was so dry that was inedible! Never again!"}
{"text":"I thought I would love this place but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be for me.  I ordered the chicken & beef shawarma plate and found the meats dry and rather one-note in flavour,  The white sauce that came with really failed to impress - I was expecting the sauce to be as good as the Halal Guys in Manhattan, but it`s not even close.    We also ordered smoked egg plant dip but it nether tasted like egg plant or had any smokey flavour.  It came in a plastic container and looked like it was made days ago and just left sitting in their fridge.    The complementary bread was ok. It smelled great but it was very bland."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, especially compared to the Mississauga restaurant. The \"Foul\" breakfast was swimming in oil. The Chicken Shawarma platter was unappetizing, especially the \"salad\" which was a few wilted pieces of lettuce with 2 slices of tomatoes.   The Mississauga restaurant was much more efficient, cleaner, friendlier, with really fresh ingredients, fantastic salad and excellent (free) coffee.   The Yonge street experience was awful. You get better food at the Eaton center food court. Definitely does NOT live up to it's \"fine foods\" moniker."}
{"text":"-Ordered beef and chicken Shawarma - Meat was dry and stiff  -Asked for garlic sauce, when opened my food at first i thought there was no garlic sauce (explains why it was dry) and Icalled restaurant, the first guy answered counter questioned me \"how come there is no garlic\"? in rude tone.  -Then very rudely he said what do you want me to do? -Then I told them I dont need any replacement of my food. -Will simply never order again -and yes all the garlic sauce was at the end ( gross)"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and always a disappointment. Food is mediocre and no service. All they want is your money. Never again, no concept of quality except for the building and decor. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to start off with, not worth what you're paying for, overpriced and under delivered food.  The portion was lacking, dry and no flavour at all. I expected a lot better. Just disappointed overall with a new restaurant that opened down the street from me."}
{"text":"this is probably my favorite paramount in town!!! the service was excellent! friendly staff and beautiful layout and design throughout the restaurant!! as for food...the Shawerma was delicious and the Baba Ganoush was the best I've ever had and I know Lebanese food very well as I am middle eastern and have been to Lebanon.  presentation was very good..bread was excellent.  highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place has the worst set up of service. Me and my boyfriend came here because he heard good things about it. We went in and ordered from the front cashier. We went to get our food and the kitchen staff was asking us what we ordered. We waited so long for our food and the shwarma wasn't even that good. I wasn't impressed with the food and the service was shit. The way they have it set up is backwards for take out. Whats the point of having you cashier send the order to the kitchen if they don't know who's ordering what and i have to repeat my whole order to them?? In that case you should order from the kitchen then pay. I always see it being so busy but the food is garbage. I have had WAY better shwarma foods then this. This place will never touch the best iv had, but it doesn't even equate to what i would consider good. If you want good shwarma go to Pita Nusto (you can read my review on this place) its amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was rather delicious. Both the pizza and meal were wonderful, it's a bit expensive but worth it. :)"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a month.  The food is always delicious, fresh, healthy and reasonably priced.  I have had my meal at the restaurant and have done take out (you can call ahead and they will have your food waiting for you).  The staff are really nice.  Paramount tends to get packed at certain times of the day - when that happens the service can get a little chaotic (you may not get your complimentary hot pita bread or you may have to remind them to bring you something you ordered).  It is a tight space with lots of tables jammed in.  But this kind of adds to the experience.  Bring your patience when it is crowded, the food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Try the lentil soup and hot bread. Service and food varies from location to location so far Shepard and VP location gave the best food and service. They also have kids play area."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars  I ordered a wrap for lunch and it tasty. I upgraded my wrap to a combo with salad and pop. It came to a little over $10.  Service - 4 stars The server was very nice and curteous. I didn't have to wait too long for my takeout.  Business Model - 2 stars As much as I love the food, I wish I didn't have to go up to the counter to order. When I dine-in, I expect to receive full service."}
{"text":"This is the first and only Paramount Fine Foods location I've been to but I'm convinced it's the best.  Consistently delicious food and impeccable customer service. I didn't get paid to write this.  I'm a regular customer since they opened their doors at the Markham location.  Today was an especially great experience.  I ordered my usual, which consists of the 7 inch Ch icken Shawarma wrap, a Lentil soup and the Tabuleh salad (which by the way, competes with the best I've ever tasted) and found a discount coupon for my next visit of $5 off, which is helpful because their prices are definitely not cheap.   I would highly recommend anyone who loves Middle Eastern food, like Falafel, Shawarma, Tabuleh and Kabobs and including sweets like baklava to try this place out.   There's no place in the area that has the quality of this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Arayas and Kofka pita. Portion sizes were poor when comparing to the prices.   Staff were friendly and food came in a timely manner though.   This place is too commercialized and I would go somewhere else to get a better experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (takeout). Bought a chicken shawarma sandwich for around $7.50 with tax. Service was ok. Shawarma was not toasted. Wrapped well. Taste was a bit above average, but nothing special in my opinion. Portion was smaller than expected."}
{"text":"Been coming back ever since a friend took me here back in October.  Came here yesterday and decided to give their Tabliyeh Saj wraps (I ordered the sujuk wrap) a try.  Flavours were amazing and the portion was generous.  Wait staff is very friendly and very nice.  I also like the Arabic music they play in the background.   Minor complaints:  the Arayess was the first thing I tried when I came here.  Taste was great but the portion was too small (especially compared to Brampton's location).  The meat was also a bit undercooked!  Seating tends to be tight and a bit uncomfortable, making it hard to put away any bags or coats.  Air conditioning is a bit too cold too.    Overall, a really nice place at a convenient location. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Having dined at the location at Yonge and Dundas, I can safely say that this location beats it by far.  I came here with a friend one night and ordered the Arayess.  The portion here was much bigger than the one downtown.  There was also more filling in the sandwich.  The interior is much roomier and seating is extremely comfortable.  It's such a shame that I live so far way though :("}
{"text":"Food was alright but they make you pay before you start eating, never seen that before. This lack of trust between the owner and the customers is not a good feeling."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh pita...served warm from the oven. Deliciously creamy hummus and crisp falafel...in a clean and friendly space. What a great find!  Will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Oh, dear, It used to be so good. recently it has gone really bad. Because I used to like It, I persisted several times. Each time it was worse than last time. It seems that they don't like women. The first bad time we waited 45 minutes for our meal. complained and nothing happened. eventually got food cold. The next time it also took ages for our wraps to arrive. How does this happen. Really I go with two other women and we are ignored. Three times is enough. I tell everyone not to go there. And the food has gone soggy and tasteless when it used to be hot and savoury. Better places."}
{"text":"I have ordered food from here several times because I truly wanted to love this place! They have let me down every single time. They actually have a very don't care attitude about their service or quality of food. I feel like they spent more on the interior designer than on quality staff and food. Countless times they forgot my order! Yes I waited and waited as I'm too polite to say anything. Anything time it came late and burnt. On a different occasion they for my father in law order but not mine or my husbands. How does that happen. The service is very rude and off putting. Lastly, all their meats are super dry. It is a shame because of love this genre of food so very much. They are a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a four but there were some fails...  Food was tasty, very large portions so definitely good value. You can easily share your dishes.  I liked their beef and cheese pizza. Sadly, the shwarma dinners do not come with tabouli and their giant free pita does not come with hummus.  You need to order them seperately.  They are large portions at a cost of $6 each.  So you end up with way more than you need at a higher cost than you expected."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here.  Halal certificate is clearly displayed inside the restaurant. This location is right across the street from the Eaton Centre, which is very convenient. I tried the BBQ Meat sandwich, which was pretty good, although it could use some hot sauce on the side (I'm desi, what can I say:)). I also tried the Chicken & Veggie Manakesh which was very good and the plain Cheese Manakesh (aka \"Jebneh\"), which was excellent! The fresh strawberry juice was good, but a little too sweet (they put sugar in it). This place get's packed for dinner time, but the food is made fresh and tastes good. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place on a Sunday is super busy. Not a place for quite dinner.  It is children friendly. I had the beef shawarma, it was okay. I'll something else next  time."}
{"text":"I was definately impressed and is worth a try!  The falafel is great!  This place has amazing garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, decent price, but setting is pretty mediocre. Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is freshly made, healthy and excellent value. The garlic sauce and saj zaatar manakeesh is the best...anywhere.  The service is great and employees like Nebela are very professional amd friendly ensuring all is exactly as you expected."}
{"text":"I came here around 10:30-11 and by 12, it was pretty full.  We had the beef and cheese pizza and chicken shawarmas. I'm not a fan of onions, and the pizza had a lot of it. It was very overpowering, but once I got used to it was pretty good.  I had asked for some hot sauce, and hummus and tahini for my shawarma, and I felt like it was a little grainy and I didn't like that too much.  I was excited for their bread (where the steam comes out), but unfortunately ours had a crack on the top so o didn't get the steam, but it was really good.  If I has the choice to, I probably wouldnt really come here again. It was decent here, not the best."}
{"text":"Wow,  Absolutely amazing food.  We were visiting Toronto and were taken here as guests. The tastes reminded us of our time in the Middle East.  Delicious.  The bread, the kabobs, the appetizers were all really tasty.  I wish I could pack it all up and bring it home to eat every day.  I feel spoiled already.  We ate at Middle Eastern restaurant back home and were really disappointed because of the delicious tastes that we savored at Paramount.  I will Definitely be going back to Paramount during my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Not only the food and service was amazing, I left my purse there with all of my IDs and cash and these guys were so kind to stay over time so that I can pick up my bag. They're the best. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Food at this place is really good, hummus and baba ghanuj is tasty.  Portions are small and prices are bit higher. Place is packed on the week end and bit hard to find table."}
{"text":"I was forced to give more than 15% of tips!!!!! Which is unheard of!! I don't mind give more tips, but she told me to choose among 15, 20 and 25 percent, don't even give me the choice of pushing the \"other \" button! I have been to this place many times, this is the first time. And I will not come again.  Nobody likes to be pushed!"}
{"text":"I got a Chicken Shawarma wrap and it was pretty tasty but VERY small. They only sell them in a small 7\" tortilla for 7.99 or something and they don't even load it up. It's highway robbery! They replaced Nora Shawarma that used to sell large stuffed wraps for the same price - I miss Nora :(. Go to Liberty Shawarma instead for much better value where you get a large wrap."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Paramount's catering for groups of 25+ multiple times and they have never disappointed. I also shared a delicious Mixed Combo Platter (Fattoush salad, chicken and beef shawarma, kafta and shish tawouk skewers, falafel, three sauces) between five friends and it was just enough to fill us up well. For $20 each, our lunch was a bit pricey but the food was wonderful. Service is friendly but a bit slow on Sundays.   If you spend over $15, you get a receipt for a free breakfast on Fridays from 8-10am!"}
{"text":"I had ordered a hummus and a chicken shawarma for dinner, came around 6:45pm on a Saturday - just before it started getting super busy within 20 mins later. Our server was extremely polite, which made the dining experience fantastic. Even though it was busy, she made sure we had everything we needed. I found the complimentary pita bread to be a bit hard. Chicken was a bit dry as well, but they did have excellent service so I added an.extra star."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef and cheese pizza. It was inexpensive ($4.25 I believe) and it was delicious. The complimentary bread as mentioned by other yelpers was fresh and puffy and it reminded me of fresh bread I had in Egypt (nostalgia)!"}
{"text":"The food is good and for a reasonable price but I don't enjoy dining in here. Getting take out is a better option because of their confusing ordering system and the uncomfortable seating arrangements."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some take away on my way home. Played it safe and went for the beef & chicken shawarma dinner, which clocked in at 15 bucks, so I had pretty high expectations.  Both the beef and chicken were insanely dry and not very flavourful whatsoever. Along with my meal was some rice, a single tomato slice, a few shreds of lettuce, and some bread. What exactly had I just paid 15 dollars for? I felt completely ripped off by both quality and quantity.  There's so many other places that come correct for much cheaper. I try to refrain from reviewing places I've only given one chance, but I doubt I'll be coming back for more. If this is how one of their \"popular\" dishes is served then I have little hope for the rest of their menu.  I'm sure other Paramount locations deliver the goods, but you might want to skip this spot."}
{"text":"I didn't even notice that this place was here until we were parking by the shoppers and just noticed it. Too lazy to figure out where to eat dinner, we decided to just give this place a go.  We've been trying a lot more middle eastern, Mediterranean cuisine as a family and have found a few favourite spots. This place was great, but definitely there are areas to improve in terms of their food options. As a new restaurant, I think they'll get there in time. Food alone would bring it to 3 star, but the amazing service is what pumps it up to a big ol' 4!  Hopefully management will read this because I want them to know, Marva, our waitress, did an amazing job. She was there when we needed her, checked up on us, and made sure we enjoyed our meal. She was happy to get feedback and was very helpful to explain the menu options to us as we were not very familiar with some of the dishes. She's very friendly and if this is the level of hospitality they have, I think you can't lose coming here.   We started off with a puffy steaming bread. I forget what it's called but we've had it before at other places. This was fresh, not burned, and soft on the inside with that hard crust on the outside. However, it was very flavourless. I think it's best if you ordered some type of dips to accompany it.   My dad ordered a lamb dinner to be cooked to medium rare, but it was almost well done and quite hard. He had give everyone a piece before biting in so by the time we found out, we already eaten half of it among all of us. The waitress, however, still offered to redo the dish, which I thought was very kind of her. Flavours were alright, but the fries on the side could have been a bit less soggy. Actually, all our fries were a bit soggy which is something they could probably fix easily. :)  The fattoush salad was very fresh and I liked the variety of vegetables in the dish. It was a bit over dressed and I found it to be a bit wet. The flavours were quite nice though :)  My mom and I shared the Tabliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma as per the recommendation of our fantastic waitress, Marva. I think I would try a different protein next time too, but this one was amazing!! There's that delicious crunch in the outer side of the saj, and you've got the stuffed insides and a garlic dip accompaniment. I loved the pickles as well which just helped cut through the savory flavours. I think this is a very well balanced dish and I would happily return for more.   Over all, we had a great time here and enjoyed our meal. Marva, was amazing!! She really did a fantastic job. With our lamb being cooked improperly, she offered to have it redone. We refused since we were almost done anyway :) But she kindly gifted us a box of sweet treats. Variations of baklawa sweets and we thoroughly enjoyed those.   Give this place a try and just let the staff know if there's anything you don't like or think could improve. They've got a great attitude. I'd love to see this place stick around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Place is OK, nice and clean on the inside although maybe reflected in the pricing.  Shawarma plate is kind of small really, not much chicken at all, mostly rice.  And what the hell is the point of putting an undressed bunch of shredded lettuce with 2 tomato slices in one corner of the box?  It has NO dressing on it but is used as a garnish of sorts that just takes up real estate inside the box so they don't have to put any more chicken or rice in it.  Kind of a scam really.  Baklavas and pitas are solid, and probably the highlight of the place since their cooked food has never done anything for me."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night (around 7:00pm) and there wasn't much of a wait.  The last time I was at Shops at Don Mills, the Paramount wasn't open yet -- I thought the restaurant would be a bit bigger but it's a decent size with a good amount of seating.  They have little wireless service bell buttons that ping the wait staff's watches, which I thought was pretty cool.  My friend and I ordered a tabbouleh salad and the mixed grill plate main.  It was more than enough food for the both of us since there was also the free pita bread (we even got asked if we wanted a bread refill).  Overall, a good experience coming to this location!"}
{"text":"Came across here today.  Asked for a chicken skewer, the girl pointed to the bottom of the menu and I thought it said $3.99.  But when she rang it up it was $6.20!.  I asked to clarify and she says the price on the menu is if you want to upgrade to chicken from an appetizer.  I wish they would have told me it would be a bit of a wait when I ordered it.  After waiting around for 10 mins, I asked what looked like a manager how much longer would it be.  He said it takes about 10-12 minutes to make it fresh.  I said, if I'd known there'd be a wait I wouldn't have bought it.  I don't mind waiting for fresh food, but I was in a bit of a hurry.  Would have been nice if they advised me first.  The product was ok.  It was just four pieces of white meat (small size) and half a small pita and some garlic sauce.  Was it worth what i paid?  Not really."}
{"text":"Good very good.  Waiting in a long line mixed with people ordering food to pay is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Alrighty! I was a little worried after seeing low reviews for this place. But fear not people - try it!   I had a hankering for middle eastern food and not the usual stuff around the area. I was ecstatic to see this place because I'd always had such wonderful food at their Yonge street location.   Customer service was friendly both from the hostess station and from the order desk. I ordered and didn't wait long. I went after their rush hour so luck was on my side but in general I find waits for their food not long at all.  I wasn't at all let down by the quality and flavour of the food. I ordered their chicken shawarma plate that came with that intoxicatingly delicious fresh bread (honestly, I could eat that all day).  I wasn't disappointed by food or service. In fact, it was on par with my previous experience.  Highly recommend! I've had other offerings from establishments in the area and this by far is the best. I've gone back already!"}
{"text":"Simple: inexpensive, fast and tasty.  Across the Yelp board this place ranks high on those qualifications.  The only thing against it is, sometimes it is hard to flag down who was helping our table.  All of them look like they are running to somewhere even if they don't need to. I swear, if you work here, you would lose weight in an instant with all the mealtime hustle and bustle. Forget  Jenny Craig.  Large portions. Awesome, light fluffy fresh bread comes to your table. It is the best I have had. I could have eaten that all night. My friend stuck the other one in his bag to eat for later.  I would have done the same but I was being nice. LOL  Caution: Do not order a cup of coffee. Most disappointing. It was very much like drinking watered down coffee. I think the next time I will have to try something from their coffee menu.  Anyway, give this place a try. You will get alot of good for a modest price."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a friend a walk. We were looking for a place to eat Yonge and Dundas and decided to give this place a try. This place is huge with high ceilings. There is a second floor but not sure it's for customers. Apart from that and the sweets the sell the food is just regular. No better than a typical sharwama joint. The service is crappy.  No drinks on the table even after the food is out. Had to waive down the waitress to bring us our drinks."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but I have not once received a takeout order without something missing that I've asked for. I'm giving this such a low rating though because the service is absolutely TERRIBLE. Like, embarrassingly so. One girl that works the cash is insanely rude and can't seem to do simple math when it comes to giving customers their change, and I've gone in multiple times when there have been less than 3 tables of customers in the entire restaurant, and each time it has taken over half an hour for a shawarma. HALF AN HOUR. For a SHAWARMA. I mean, come on. Each time they say it will be quick, and I end up sitting for ages like an idiot. Why do I go back, you ask? Because I like shawarma, and I'm lazy. (They're right beside my building.) I've learned that I need to call at least half an hour in advance and cross my fingers they omit the pickles, as I've asked them to do. I really feel that they're only still open because of lazy people who don't want to venture out of the Village for middle eastern, but sooner or later, if the crappy service keeps up, even bums like me will get fed up and start looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find good Lebanese food in Toronto. I'm personally not a fan of Paramount.   The food is very average and not exactly authentic Lebanese Food. The one thing I do like about this place and why they get an extra star is because of the Bread. They roll our fresh pita bread that goes great with Hummus.  Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Middle Eastern food, Paramount is my go-to place! I love that it's so close to the Eaton Centre and they always provide pillow-like, steamy pitas! I love their Shawma plates, the portions are big and the food is generally quite consistent and fresh. I've got their pitas before which are also good but the portion is TINY so I wouldn't recommend if you're super hungry. I love the food here but I gotta say that Tabule takes the cake for me when it comes to the best Middle Eastern food in Toronto.  The service isn't usually great here though, it seems to be on and off. And the ambience is nice but the tables are so crammed together! Last time I was here, they weren't seating anyone upstairs (not sure why) and my boyfriend and I got seated in a very crammed spot downstairs where the people beside us had half their stuff squished under our table!"}
{"text":"It's like riding a magic carpet into Aladdin's Palace when you enter Paramount Fine Foods. Suddenly, you are no longer in the bleek industrial Misses Sausage, but in some Arabian paradise.  The Sandwich shwarmas are good. Falafel good. Some kind of mini arabic meat pizzas were delicious. Fries are excellent. Food does come to the table as it's ready, so don't expect everything to come at once.   The Paramount Special is an interesting juice blend of mango, pineapple, yogurt and pistachio among other ingredients.   It's a good spot to go if you're in this area."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of the Paramount near the Eaton Centre, so when this place opened up near work, I was super excited.  It's very disappointing.  The bowls and plates are not generous. At the Yonge location, you can order way more than you can eat for so cheap. Here, not so much. Everything is very carefully measured out. Tt seems much more expensive.  When they announced that they were opening here, I figured they'd be selling me lunch 4 or 5 times per work week, no question; instead, I went twice and then never again. :-/"}
{"text":"They have shawarma, mixed grills, arayess, etc... some great juices (e.g. Strawberry) and lots of good deserts.  I ordered a mixed grill and a strawberry juice. The mixed grill was pretty good, some juices dripping from the meat. I think the meat was a bit over-done but it almost always is in these kinds of places. The strawberry juice is usually great, but this time it was a too sugary and tasted like red syrup. I'd give it an 'okay'.   I asked for rice instead of fries -- they give way too much rice for me. Others might differ.  The side vegetables (some tomatoes and lettuce) are really dull.   Good staff------ Service speed was great The staff seems to care about people -- they communicate well and even though the place is busy they are professional.  Issues with this visit----------  I asked for extra onion and tomato -- didn't get it. I never get it even though I always ask every time I visit.  This is a chain. I've been to a few Paramount's in other cities. It's above-average Middle Eastern, but not Gourmet.  It is better than most shawarma places owing to the good juices and great desert selection."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive for the quantity of food. For example, I ordered a shish tawook skewer. It cost approximately $6.50 and it has only 4 pieces - see photo, and yes, this is how it looked when arrived (I didn't touch it). It looks like someone's leftovers were thrown into the plastic container. No love here. Never ordering from Paramount again. There are other much better middle eastern food places to eat from."}
{"text":"This place is strange...it is like half restaurant half food court. I had heard good things about the food and being at Young and Dundas and all...well you know how hard it is to find a good restaurant there.   Ordered: hummus and falafel plate.   Pro: good portion size and good price ($15 for two people with more than enough to share), even took some hummus and pita home. The falafals were warm, crispy and super fresh. Not at all dry. Also, our food came to us amazingly quickly.   Con: Hummus was definitely b.l.a.n.d. My friend and I agreed that it needed some salt, some lemon, some garlic-something! I make way better stuff at home. Also, the music and the ambient noise was so loud that my friend had to come sit directly beside me in order to have a conversation.   The service was very poor. Our waiter took our order and did not return-ever. We sat for over an hour with empty plates and wanting more water and finally the bill. We flagged over another server who was friendly and gave us the bill.   Ended up over tipping  because we didn't want to wait for the change.   C'est la vie"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went yesterday and it was fabulous! A chicken shawarma and their spicy chicken pizza was less than $20.00. The table and seats were very clean. Also, the service was great as well! There was a coffee station in case you want to help yourself with a free coffee.   They even had a prayer room and a mini play area for kids.   Overall I will recommend this location to my friends and family."}
{"text":"When I made the reservation for 9, I was told to expect delays as the restaurant had another group of 60.  However, I didn't anticipate any delays and service and food was excellent. Keep it up Paramount"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend and was quite pleased with the service and food.  The only negative I can think was that the tables were very close to each other and did not get the privacy of having a conversation."}
{"text":"Boring grilled meat.  Boring flatbreads.  Well, I guess consistency is a virtue."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying my \"regular order\" from this Paramount location pretty much every week for the past two months now - a kafta wrap, fattoush salad, and a Coke.  The other day, I placed this order through Ritual, as I always do.  My order was not accepted, the app indicated that they were out of kafta.  Ok, no problem . . . I ordered a shish tawook wrap instead.  It was the fattoush salad that I was really craving, anyway.  Oddly enough, the \"fattoush salad & a Coke\" option was greyed out within the Ritual app, so I opted for \"fattoush salad & a Diet Coke\" as my side.  I figured I could just ask when I got to the restaurant for a Coke instead.  The anticipated \"order ready time\" as per the app was 12:31PM.  I arrived right around then, and was told that my order was delayed.  No big deal.  I took the opportunity to ask if I could have a fattoush salad and a Coke, rather than a fattoush salad and a Diet Coke.  This is when the woman working the cash told me that they no longer offered fattoush salad as a combo option, and that I would be getting fries instead.  I reiterated that fattoush salad is what I ordered - even showed her my order on my phone, and she insisted that they no longer offered this option, and that I would be getting fries instead.  (This is despite the fact that Paramount still offers fattoush salad.)  So here I am, at Paramount, waiting for a chicken wrap and fries when I had really wanted a kafta wrap and a salad.  The cashier blamed Ritual for the mix-up, and had no interested in addressing my concern.  The manager ended up coming by while I was waiting for my food, and I explained the situation.  She said \"oh, but we do have kafta\".  I showed her the Ritual app, which clearly showed that kafta wasn't available.  She seemed surprised, and explained that they have no visibility into the Ritual menu, they only accept/reject orders.  I was told that my order for a fattoush salad should have never been accepted.  In the end, I did get my kafta wrap and a side fattoush salad.  But, to be honest, it shouldn't have been such a fight to get what I had ordered.  These guys really need to learn a thing or two about customer service, as it would have been quite simple to make me happy - by just giving me what I ordered - and they opted to argue with me instead.    It is unfortunate, because I really do like Paramount and want to support the brand based on the social initiatives of the founder.  But this experience really put me off."}
{"text":"As mediocre of a \"Middle Eastern\" place as can be. I used quotations because Paramount is no where near authentic. Used to be amazing before it was a franchise now the quality has gone down and the prices have gone way up."}
{"text":"Food is ok. 6/10. Not the best Middle Eastern food in the world. In fact, it used to be better and I noted a quick decline with the quality of the spreads and the quantity of the meat.   Service is also spiraling downward. I have been to this and other locations many times and it seems over the years, they've gotten busier and the service, slower and less courteous.   I visited yesterday and waited at the door after requesting a table for two for the upstairs loft. It seems the host didn't hear me because 10 minutes later, he motioned to me to follow him and immediately turned around and proceeded to walk to a table where he intended to place me, on the main level. He did this so quickly that I didn't even have a chance to talk him. Granted, they were busy, but alas, too bad, because they just lost my business and all my referrals.  I went back to the front and asked him about the upstairs, to which he responded that it was closed.   Why didn't I want to sit downstairs and enjoy my lunch? Well, because the tables are so crammed, that your elbows need restriction, otherwise you might give your neighbour patron a concussion or a kidney injury. The floor is tiled and reminds me of the kitchen of Burger King. The activity and noise is so much that you can't even pay attention to your own food. No thanks. This is not my idea of a nice lunch. Not even a marginal one.  So, I thanked the man and said that I won't be staying. Went to Marché. Had a fabulous lunch and guess what? No one suffered a concussion or a kidney injury. In fact there was lots of room to enjoy a sophisticated and lovely lunch without the rushed, noisy, institutional, and money-hungry-driven \"atmosphere\" of Paramount. Ugh."}
{"text":"I've been and still am an avid Paramount Foods fan... I first discovered the Crestlawn location, checked out the Downtown TO branch, and I'm a regular at the Matheson and Erin Mills location... Sadly I was a touch disappointed with the Thornhill location (Yonge and Clarke area) food was still great but I guess I've gotten spoiled with the excellent service at the other locations  Food tasted great but was not offered a free pita like the other locations, nor did the servers check on you if you needed anything .   Next time I'll just wait to get home so that I won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best beef shawarmas I've had. They filled the pita--it was delicious. We used Skipthedishes to order and the wait was reasonable for any delivered meal. I also ordered the dolmas (wrapped grape leaves), they were good, minty and sour. They also included 2 extra pitas. Will definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Ok the good: silken hummus. Big, puffy bread. Very taste.  The bad: no alcohol! how can I enjoy dinner with no wine?  Next time I take to go. LCBO next door."}
{"text":"Waited 35 mins to receive my takeout order of chicken shwarma warp.....the shawarma was luke warm and tasted GARBAGE. Side note free coffee was decent."}
{"text":"I see lots of negative reviews of this place - mostly from people who had wrong expectations.    This is not your local Shawarma Joint for a quick bite. Let me clarify it for you, their slogan \"Fine Middle Eastern Dining\" would be better rephrased as \"Fine Islamic Dining.\"  What, the 'no alcohol' on the menu didn't tip you off?  Or the fact that there is a Prayer Room in every one of their restaurants?  Nothing wrong with it, just hone your expectations.   The Shawarma is dry.  Yes, this is the 'all lean meat and no fat' shawarma popular in the middle east.  Your regular 'hole in the wall' shawarma is probably Greek-influenced where lots of fatty cuts are added to get the 'juiciness\".  In the Middle East such shawarma is considered for \"poor people.\"  The high end shawarma has only lean cuts - and hence it is 'dry'.  You're supposed to mix it with sauces, hummus, baba ganoush etc.  Have you tried there dip sampler? Absolutely amazing! The freshest, tastiest dips in Toronto. I've already warned you about how they (intentionally) make their Shawarma - but the other meat cuts (shis tawook, kebap) are amazing.    Have in mind that their wraps are not overflowing with meat.  Again - this is how it is done in the Middle East (as opposed to Greece and Turkey).  Just hone your expectations and order a platter - plenty of meat.   Service was good and prompt, but not servile.  Food came out quite fast.   If people knew what to expect - there would be less frustration.  Around Eid the place is packed."}
{"text":"I am looking at all these 1* reviews and I wonder what has happened?  This place is not the best restaurant in Toronto, but definitely not the worst either.  Looking closer at the reviews, it seems lots of reviewers with 1 or few reviews - maybe revenge reviews from a competitor? That would be a pretty crappy behavior - Yelp is not the place to settle petty competition.  This place is the former Vespa Pizzeria, and it looks much better after Paramount renovated it, very upscale look inside.  The service is a bit hectic around the Liberty Village lunch hour, but not bad at all, which makes me doubt all these reviewers below who gave it 1* for bad service.  The menu is quite extensive and has lots of variations on shish kebabs and shawarma.  The food is good, the portions are big, and the owner is always on-hand, running around and being friendly to all customers.    My order was mistaken, they brought me Mixed Shawarma, while I actually ordered Mixed Grill, so the owner made sure I got my plate and then he also packed the wrong plate to go, as a freebie for me.  That was mighty nice, especially since it is the first time I step into the place, or see the guy.  The pricing is a bit on the high side ($23 for Mixed Grill), but for a full dining experience in LV it is not that bad.   Again, the crappy competition seems to be filling the Yelp reviews with 1* - really crappy behavior that Yelp should sanction."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent.  We both got chicken schwarma.  I had mine on the Saj bread and mom had hers as a pita wrap.  Both came out quickly and piping hot as well as the fries.  Everyone was very friendly and service was good."}
{"text":"Again this a place that is quite overhyped.  The food was just okay.    Me and my friend got the shawarma fries and they gave alot of chicken and fries. So portions are pretty big atleast in terms of the fries but there was waay too much sauce. My other friend got a wrap and it looked much smaller compared to our items. There wasnt alot of beef in her wrap either. Service was great though."}
{"text":"man this is hard for me to give such a mediocre review. but when you factor in everything including pricing I can't give this more than a 3.5 and rounding up wouldn't be fair either.  A few things I liked write away is the fact that it's located in a big plaza and has multiple locations you can try the same food at. There is some authenticity there.  What I didn't like is the astonishly higher prices than the usual hole in the wall joint or even typical shawarma place. Yes I get this place is trying to emulate an elevated experience. I didn't really see that especially in the take-out.  Food  Yes you have your typical selections and combinations all of which where for example a meat sampler is around $50 and you look at what you get it looks good on paper but a lot of it is going to be slightly overcooked or just not enough of that flavour profile you probably want.  Pricing & Value  If you're going here expect to pay more. YOu are paying for more than just food, you are paying for the atmosphere, the brand name, etc.   Overall it's a 3.5 for me but rounded down 3. There are other places for take-out that offer more value for similar cuisine."}
{"text":"\"A nice shawarma sit down place. Not bad value either\"   Yes it's a tad. Ore pricey than your typical greasy spoon type of shawarma place but this place has ample seating, lots of selection and food that is very fresh. Unlike many of the greasy spoon shawarma places I've been to, this place is generous with all of the veggies and meat. Not picking and choosing a pinch of everything, there is enough to get full on for about $10-$12.  For a lunch downtown near work or near the eaton centre, it's a solid option if you're feeling middle eastern.   Atmosphere is busy but inviting. Flavours are plentiful and authentic enough. Service is good. Not a bad place. At least a 3.5 but I'll round up."}
{"text":"I'm surprised we've never dropped in, with Paramount being located right in the middle of downtown across from Eaton Centre. Our friends took us here during the weekend, after talking the place up quite a bit, but we didn't leave disappointed.  Anytime four people can eat for $15, and be filled to the point of agony with delicious fresh manakeesh; This has to be one of the best cheap eats place in the entire city.   It was fairly busy, even on the holiday Monday, but we were seated rather quickly and the wait staff was very quick and friendly. Aside from the different manakeesh we tried, he had the hummus and fresh pita as well, which was all great.  Location for Pramount is great as well, being built into an older building with some really outstanding architecture toward the front.  Yelp has Paramount listed at moderately priced, but really, it's quite cheap; Cheaper than more fast food, but high quality and fresh. We'll definitely be dropping by again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Valentine's Day. Paramount marked the occasion by giving a long stem red rose to each lady, and by making their signature puffy pita bread heart-shaped.  It was a very busy place on Valentines Day with couples, groups of friends and families, but we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Service was friendly but a little disorganized.    After waiting quite a long time for our drinks, the food service came promptly. We started with a couple of falafel balls with tahini sauce (so good!) I had the shish tawouk sandwich. He had the mixed grill plate.  I was impressed with the variety of offerings on their menu and the reasonable prices. I'd like to return sometime soon."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, tastes horrible, and I was sick afterwards.   Skip this place and go directly to Pamier Kabob a little south."}
{"text":"This place has some solid food in a part of the city that is usually known for mall food courts and touristy chains.  The FOOD is the reason to come here.  Everything is incredibly fresh and delicious.  The falafel do not go on holiday here, instead, they are fried to order and come out deliciously fresh.  They also come with a delicious garlic sauce, so if you're on a date, make sure you're both having it ;)  The chicken shawarma here was a definite hit.  Clearly real chicken was harmed in the making of it, and it shows.  None of that pressed factory garbage that gets shipped in frozen.  That was truly delicious.  It's served with a side of pita that comes out freshly baked and puffed up in an awesome way.  The SERVICE we had was great.  We got very lucky and had a very good waitress last time, who despite being rather busy was quite on top of our needs.  This level of service is not always guaranteed.  The process of getting a table though always seems to involve an insane amount of confusion and waiting and miscommunications.  What is going on at the host/hostess station?    The VENUE itself is just fine.  Tables are super close togethers...it's back to back (and side to side).  The upstairs looks pretty cool, but I've never gotten to sit there.  Avoid the front venues in cold weather...it was just silly cold there, and everyone still had their hats and coats on sitting there.  Crazy!  Overall, the best middle eastern food I've had in the city at a reasonable price.  Especially good if you need something to eat to fuel your shopping spree at the Eaton Centre that won't break the budget."}
{"text":"This Paramount is a bit different from the other locations, as this one seems more geared towards take-out/fast food, rather than a sit down meal. They have customizable box and wrap options, and that's about it. The food quality itself is quite good.   I had a chicken wrap, and it was beautifully grilled, juicy, and moist. The fries were very crispy, and on par with what you would get at any other Paramount location.   The staff were great. They pointed out that it would be cheaper for me to get the combo (wrap + fries + drink), than to get the wrap + drink on their own. And they were right! I ended up saving money and got more food in the end!  Will definitely return the next time I'm in the area and want to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Halal options and for Middle Eastern food. The fresh pitas were much appreciated, fluffy and could make for a great appetizer if coupled with hummus. We opted for the mezza plate which was a good way to try multiple dips, of which my favourite was moutabbal. The mix grill was quite delicious, however in terms of portions I expected something a bit more. Meat was still cooked well and was quite flavourful. I also tried the falafel main, which to be honest was not a favourite. A little bit on the drier side, and could have used more sauce...perhaps ordering 6 falafels was not the best way to try this dish.  Finally the manakeesh is my personal favourite, in particular zataar with cheese. Mind you, zataar is not for everybody and is certainly an acquired taste (I find it delicious having grown up with it). But if you choose to be less adventurous, I highly recommend the plain cheese manakeesh. Will give the beef a try the next time I visit. Overall, very happy with my meal and would come back again."}
{"text":"First time visit this place and it was awesome the food was amazing and it's agree at atmosphere and it's a great place for a party and good prices !!"}
{"text":"Ordered a lentil soup to start and the fatouleh salad with a skewer of lamb on the side. Lentil soup was great. Salad was mediocre. Lamb was minuscule. There was more chicken in one piece of my friends chicken than there was on my whole dish. I've been to better restaurants like Me va Me etc. and this place can't compete. The staff was friendly but the food was tragic. I wish I took a photo. Don't order the lamb!!"}
{"text":"Had a few meals here - all of them good, although nothing to rave about. Being of middle-eastern descent my teta makes some mean food, so expectations are high.   Falafels - good but not great. Not enough spice in them, could use a little more flavour. But they are fresh which is good. Disappointing that to get a side of hummus to dip them in will cost you $5.00.   Shish Taouk - again, good but not great. Was recommended to me over the shawarma dinner and i kind of wish i had gone shawarma. Good portions though and the food is all cooked to order.  Hummus - tasty hummus, great for dipping the fresh pitas or falafel balls. I enjoyed it.   Would visit again - rather pay a little bit more for fresh food than go to a dump like shawarma's king and get two day old falafels"}
{"text":"Wish staff was nicer. Food is good in comparison to all the other Arabic restaurants in Toronto. Not as greasy. Location is very convenient and perfect for business. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Paramount serves up some good tasting Middle Eastern Food, including some popular and familiar dishes, like shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, shish tawouk (shish kabob), and more.  The food tastes good, is presented fairly well, but is a bit on the pricey side.  The ordering system is confusing and annoying. You're seated by a host/server and given a menu but you have to go up to the cashier to order and prepay for your food. The food is brought to the table by a server. Suppose I wanted to order something else? Maybe I want to pay by credit card and add a tip, but I don't know if the service warrants it before I eat. Hmmm..."}
{"text":"I've been to their Sheppard Avenue location several times and have always enjoyed the food but questioned the process of ordering at the counter and prepaying for the meal. This location has full table service. Yay! Did they all change? I hope so.  Our server was very patient and attentive while my friend and I waited for a third companion to join us. He was friendly and engaging but lacked the finesse of a seasoned server. Very good effort though.  We ended up ordering Falafel, two Mixed Grill Plates (chicken beef, kafta), a lentil soup, and a Mezza Plate (hummus, moutabbal, and tabbouleh). It was served with their signature puffy pita. As expected, everything tasted really good and the portions were generous (enough to take some home).  We finished our meal with some cappuccino and baklawa. A good finish."}
{"text":"This food here is hit or miss depending on the server.  Sometimes the food is quite tasty, other times it's just all off and unpleasant and much smaller portions.    Last time I got a plate and ordered fries with it, and the guy preparing the food took some old fries that had been lying in the basket above the fryer that were look warm and used them for serving.  It was really unpleasant!  Another time I turned up at around 8pmThe servers just don't any pride in what they're preparing for you.  They also tend to serve the chicken that was cut long before you get your food, rather than fresh off the grill.  Sadly, this is unlike anything like the much better quality of the Paramount location close to Yonge and Queen street opposite the Eaton centre.   This execution of the making of the food at this location really does put shame on the Paramount franchise.   I will rarely visit this location, even though this is a very local eat :("}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants of all time and I miss not having a location near work and hope my work moves near one! The lentil soup I had today was awesome. I've always loved stewed okra and their version is great. The portions and prices are very reasonable and the service is so fast, friendly and efficient. This place is a well oiled machine, the staff always attentive, friendly and welcoming as is middle eastern custom. Their fresh strawberry drink is amazing, hard to find elsewhere. Despite this growth with many locations now, their standards have never compromised or gone down hill like other family businesses that have expanded."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch. We both had chicken shawarma  plates with fries, plus we shared a mezzo platter. The hummus and babaganush is one of the tastiest in the city. Service was friendly. Overall we both enjoyed our meal. Without drinks, it was $25 per head (including tip).  Overall very satisfied with my meal. Wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Okay - so yesterday I came here around 6:00 pm with a few of my friends.  We were hoping to get out of there by 7:00 pm since we were catching \"Wicked\" at 7:30 pm.  It was 6 of us.    The appetizers came by REALLY quickly.  However, it took forever for two plates to come by...  Including mine.  My plate didn't show up until 6:50 pm (are you serious?!).  I scarfed down my food just to get to the show on time.  I've never been so disappointed with the service at a restaurant before.  However, food was fairly decent, and my friend who waited even longer than I did got her plate for free because they were waiting for an hour to get their food."}
{"text":"I ordered a spinach & cheese pizza for takeout. Service was very friendly and happy, but when I got my pizza it was very small. Even though it's cheap, the other Paramount I visited gave a much bigger portion. Sort of a disappointment."}
{"text":"So we ordered one starter, falafel sandwich and one combo meal. We asked for water first followed by starter and main course. The falafel came first, followed by combo meal and the started came last. We kept asking for water but still no luck, the staff was so rude. since it was not busy I am giving it 1 star as there was no option to give zero. Falafel was so dry and cold tht we could hardly eat. Never coming back to paramount ever again. Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Really expensive for the amount of food you get. I ordered a shish tawook (2 skewers, fries, and naan only!!), substituted the fries for some greens, added a soup and paid $27 inc tax. The salad portion for the extra $2 is totally not worth it.   Major major major rip off! Service is slow too."}
{"text":"Dine in or take out. No waiter to take your order. You get seated and look over your menu then go to counter to place order. Food will get delivered to your table. Be prepared to wait.  Restaurant was immaculate with plenty of seating. No wait.  For kids, the pizza like entre was very tasty and a good sized for price.  Other food items were smaller portioned compared to price. Lamb was pricy for only 3 pieces on a Pita. It was very delicious, just not a lot of it.  Platter came with plenty of rice and pickled vegetables (tasty). Chicken was tasty and not over cooked! (Very common restaurant foul sometimes) sauces are on side so you can add to your preference.  Middle Eastern food menu options. Hummus or lamb on your palette? Large selection of deserts. Tabouli was delicious - no cous cous was their version.  Overall good food but overpriced for food portions. Could easily be corrected with more of the protein portions increased."}
{"text":"I have been to around 5 locations, and by far this one is the worst of the worst. They are giving the Paramount brand name a real bad beating.  First of all the hummas literally has a drop of olive oil on it, when we asked for more oil, they said that it ran out. Like seriously, how can a Middle Eastern restaurant function without any oil???  Second of all a shwarma should be of superior quality for a restaurant of this caliber, WRONG!!! It was such a dry shwarma, that it felt like punishment to finish up all of it.  In general all Paramounts have jacked up their prices while cutting down quantity and in some places like this QUALITY."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is casual but nice. I went with 2 carnivores and they ordered the meat platter which had chicken and beef shawarma and lamb plus falafel. They enjoyed the meats and said they were tasty and well cooked. I found the falafel dry and bland.  I was happy to start with the gf vegetarian mezza plate of hummus, baba ganouj and taboule. The taboule was very sour but the 2 spreads were great and the baba ganouj had a lovely smoky flavour. My family enjoyed the warm pita and zaatar manakeesh which I avoided because they were not gf. The fatoush salad was very fresh and the lentil soup was filling but both had fried pita crisps with them. The fries were average. The staff were all friendly and helpful. There was no wait and easy to get a table as a walk in on a Monday night."}
{"text":"How should I describe this restaurant? Tasty food, friendly staff and good ambience. Wouldn't complain about anything of it! Since I knew this place, I have always returned for a plate of garden salad, chicken skewers and lentil soup. Their chicken Shish is excellent! It reminds me of one of my fav restaurant in Istanbul! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern restaurant downtown!!! They serve very tasty food in generous portions. The staff is friendly and the place is always busy. You see all kinds of people eating there, not just middle eastern. I took my South American mother there, who is not familiar with that kind of food, but she absolutely loved it. I love the chicken shawarma because it tastes amazing. I know it's not adventurous but it really is so good there. I have also tried the Kafta and I liked that too. The bread is super fresh and huge, perfect with their hummus. The baklava is sold by weight and both pistachio and cashew are worth a try. I was supposed to take them home but ended up eating all of the baklava before leaving the restaurant. Just delicious!!! Will go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and the food wasn't bad. Given the low yelp ratings we were surprised at what we got. The wrap was considerably smaller than other Paramount locations but overall, a decent experience."}
{"text":"Went into Paramount because it was late and we were looking for something quick to eat.  Had no prior knowledge of what Paramount is like, it was chaotic at first, but there was order to the chaos!  Remember your table number if you were going to order and stay to eat.  The line-up was the longest wait I had.  Despite the crazy amount of people dining, our food was served at an exceptional speed!  The hummus was fresh and light and the falafels were fantastic!  Will probably return in the future!"}
{"text":"Food: Hummus w/ chicken was tasty and filling. The complimentary pitas were fresh and hot. The tabouleh was fine as was the chicken and veggie pizza.  Service: Depending on your mood, it's either slow or leisurely. There's definitely service issues since we had to wave the waiter down for napkins and cutlery, and there was a noticeable gap between the first dish (pizza) and the other dishes. But it was a nice day and we were seated immediately so we were able to relax and lounge about enjoying the conversation. And while they did get busy while we were there, they never tried to rush us out after we finished eating.  tl;dr: yup, it's disorganized, but the food and decor ain't bad."}
{"text":"@ParamountFoods #YELPGTA #SHAWARMA  The Paramount chain has always been a hit or miss for me. Almost everyone I know rave about Paramount, my Dad being one of the fans. It was with him that I made my way to try the Heartland location. And unfortunately, my experience was a total miss.   This location boasts modern interiors and a great patio, but I seem to prefer the Dixie location's look better. The food was dry and overcooked. I've never had such tough lamb meat! I think the fluffy complimentary pitas were the only redeeming part of the meal. To add to the experience, I have to knock off points for service. Nobody was around refilling our waters to the point that I had to get up and get a jug to fill everyone's glasses on our table.   My dad and our family friends were fairly unimpressed with the meal as well. So this is not just one bad experience but 5 bad experiences. Skip this location and go to another one. That's my suggestion."}
{"text":"First visit: Didn't like it at all. The sitting admist a crowd, going up to order food, and waiting around for it is just not my scene. But my Dad's a fan, so I knew it wasn't my last visit.   Second visit: Not as bad. I went for lunch with a friend, who happens to love Paramount as well. I felt the food for lunch it much better, fresher. Also, the platter portions were bigger.  Third visit: Maybe I was really hungry but the food was really good! Went with my Dad, ordered two platters which was actually too much; one would have been fine. Fries were soggy. Thank god with ordered rice with the other platter. The rice totally made up for the fries. I don't know what they dipped the rice in but god, was it yummy!  Tip: Fuck fries, order rice!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It features many dishes that can be bought in the fast-food variety at most shawarma places, but it doesn't feel like McDonalds here.  I've never had Jalab (drink) before, but it blew my mind - think roses in drink form. On the other hand, this place is not the highest end restaurant you could go to. The mixed grill was extremely large (enough for two) and yet it felt kind of basic compared to platters you can get at Lebanese Express, for example. So I'm a bit conflicted on whether to give a positive or negative review, and I'll leave it at that"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for a number of years now. Our typical fix is za'atar bread, which I highly recommend, chicken shwarmas and a falafel plate. They have a good assortment of baklava as well. On our previous visit we ordered takeaway and were given the incorrect number of shwarmas, which they were kind enough to offer a cash-back refund with a free mini baklava box."}
{"text":"I personally had a good experience overall. The food came out fairly quickly, all the servers were very kind. Me and my girlfriend had chicken&beef shwarma. It was awesome! All the dishes felt fresh and the unlimited baked bread they gave us was a delight. Although the servers were nice, they were a bit slow. Other than that, i woulnt mind coming back :)"}
{"text":"3.5/5 I came here today with a couple of friends for lunch. Upon walking in I was immediately greeted by a hostess with a smile. The waterfall wall was also a nice touch! The restaurant was also packed!!! I was impressed! I was excited to have an awesome meal!   I ordered the chicken and beef shawarma plate, my friend ordered the lentil soup with a falafel wrap and my other friend ordered a chicken shawarma wrap. The star out of the 3 meals?? The lentil soup! WOW! That was amazing! The bowl was huge and Ohhh so filling! my friend had to take her falafel wrap home for dinner. Next time I'm definitely ordering the lentil soup! The shawarma plate was alright 3/5...The garlic sauce again ... Okay 3/5 average... The hummus was pretty good 4/5 and the hot fresh pita bread was awesome 5/5. Baklava ...3.5/5.  I've been meaning to yelp this place for a while and now that I have I probably would only be back for the lentil soup and pita bread....I'll stick with pita & grill at tomken & eglinton for my shawarma wraps and dinner plates!"}
{"text":"If I am in Toronto, and I don't visit this place for breakfast.....then I don't consider myself to be in Toronto!  For me, this food is from Heaven. Simple, fresh and delicious. I have been here at least more than 50 times, and NEVER had any bad experience.  They know how to treat you and how to serve fresh food....Can't get any better.  Things that I usually order:  - Hummus with Beef Shawarma - Zatir Pie - Meat Pie - Spicy Tomato and Onion pie - Egg Pie - Turkish Coffee (served Free all day long)  I wish, we could have ONLY ONE PLACE like this here in Atlanta. I have been to Dearborn, MI; which is considered \"the Arab town\" of North America, but none of the restaurants came even close to this gem.  If you are in the 100 mile radius of this restaurant, you must visit it.....I can assure you, its worth the drive!"}
{"text":"LOVE Paramount - HATE this location! No saj wraps, limited meat selection. Nothing more frusterating than looking at their menu above, but didnt sell both of the items I wanted, with an explanation of \"those didnt sell well here\" If the menu was accurate I would return. skip this location!"}
{"text":"I like the food here, especially the shish tawouk, falafels, and the various little \"pizzas\" selection they've got. More than anything I think this location has really great customer service! The staff are always helpful and pleasant. It gets pretty busy near the dinner time rush, especially for takeout, so arrive early!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this location to open.  Finally has and it didn't disappoint. I've been to the Mississauga and Thornhill locations and been more than happy with each.  Having one so close... oh yeah. Was a little worried that there would be growing pains for the new place, but it seems to be running like a well oiled machine.  Place was packed and everything was flowing smoothly.  Servers were friendly to all and the place looks great. I absolutely love their chicken shawarma.  This place will be seeing plenty of check ins from me."}
{"text":"Love this place, have to stop in whenever I'm in the area. IMO best chicken shawarma pita in the GTA. Tried their greek salad last time in and it was excellent. Place is spotless, servers professional and happy to answer any questions."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Mississauga, I resided near Paramount Fine Foods' original location and I think I must've gotten takeout from them almost once a week. The food was always fresh and delicious.  In the few years since I left, however, Paramount has expanded at an astronomical rate and I'd heard that the quality had begun to suffer as a result. I was nevertheless excited when I discovered that the franchise was opening a location in my neck of the woods of Yonge and Eglinton.  Sadly, the news of Paramount's downfall was not incorrect.  I decided to order my old standby of Chicken and Beef Shawarma (\"a mix of chicken and beef shawarma, served with garlic sauce and tahini\" and also \"white rice, a side of lettuce, tomatoes, mixed pickles, and a basket of our homemade pita bread\").  I brought the food home and opened the package and honestly, I think I might've audibly gasped when I saw what was waiting inside. There was hardly enough food in there to feed a small child, let alone a grown adult. The portions of each and every item were almost comically small. This was especially egregious when it came to the chicken and beef, of which a medium-sized spoonful had been provided. (Seriously, I could've eaten all the protein on this plate in about three mouthfuls.)  And although there was quite a bit of white rice, the lettuce, tomatoes, and mixed pickles were laughable in their miniscule portion sizes. And that \"basket of homemade pita bread\" equaled a single pita bread. I mean, c'mon.  The food itself was fine but nothing special. The meat did have the crunchy bits one covets in good shawarma, but it was awfully dry and didn't taste even remotely fresh.  Did I mention that this sad meal cost me $16 with tax? $16! Absurd.  I'm so disappointed. I just don't understand why a restaurant brand new to the area would so quickly resort to ripping off its customers and serving substandard food. It's baffling."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had seen this new location being built so we thought we would stop in and see what all the hype was about. We ordered a falafal wrap, tabouleh, and a chicken dinner which were good. The customer service was incredible and the staff were so friendly. The food also came out so fast. Will definitely visit again,"}
{"text":"When they opened 1st day I ordered their Whole chicken, and they told me it's not available. Now after many months I come back to try their whole chicken, they tell me it's not available. WhT kind of restaurant doesn't have the food they advertise in their menus?"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. Fast service. One of the better middle eastern meals I've had outside of the Middle East. Only downside is since the kitchen is behind the counter, the whole place smells like smoke and stains your clothes with the smell."}
{"text":"We normally get the chicken shawarma with fattoush salad. Its amazing with extra garlic. I also add pickles, turnip, onion and tahini. The hubby gets the shawarma plate and he loves it too. WARNINg if you order with just eat they dont read the comments so you dont get what you want. If you do order with just eat call the restaurant and remind them to read it. This literally happens to us every time (3 and counting) so we learned our lesson! The manager is ok at resolving the issue. He might send another order or even one of his own staff which was nice- except he got lost and came 1 hour late. Food is good though- minus that one time i found a produce sticker in my salad...ugh I hope nothing else goes wrong."}
{"text":"I was there today and I CAN say that this place USED to be good. Now, it's just another over priced unauthentic joint, a dime a dozen in GTA. I bought their knafeh nabulsi and manakeesh zatar -- and that was a mistake. $11 for 400g of knafeh nabulsi that tasted BAD and terrible manakeesh zatar. IF Walmart solid knafeh nabulsi and manakeesh zatar it would likely taste better. They also have way too many clueless and untrained staff that dont even know what they are selling or the product correct name. Giving them 2 stars is me being generous."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one downtown Toronto by the Eaton. Ordered takeout over the phone for a group of people, and the food was prepared and packaged properly. The place was pretty much empty when we picked up the food."}
{"text":"Save your money. New restaurant, with a prime location... Missed opportunity... Small and off ratio food portions, high price point, and sub-par quality of food... I don't they they will be around long. Most of the dish was rice, barely any meat. I was still hungry after. Price point is high... and unfortunately the food quality just wasn't there. I can't believe this is what replaced Messinis. I doubt they will be able to change much since they are a food chain. When you compare all the other options around the area it's surprising this is what they bring to the table. It's unfortunate since Yonge and Eglinton is a booming neighborhood. It will soon be high traffic for business'."}
{"text":"After expecting to meet my friend at a regular greasy spoon falafel joint my experience at the Yonge & Dundas Paramount was excellent.  The ambiance was a perfect mix of Toronto and the Middle East.  Exposed brick and modern fixtures were perfectly juxtaposed with the huge trays of baklava and kaak kinafe on traditional brass stands.   We shared a mediocre fattoush salad and each got a Manakeesh (pizza) which were $3.99 each and 10\".  The accawi cheese with zaatar (fried thyme and sesame) Manakeesh was really delicious.  Spinach with cheese was so-so and had an odd sour note.    What really made the meal knock my socks off was the HOT SAUSE!  YUM!  They make it in their own facility (where their Mississauga location is).  It has onions and tomato, black and red pepper.  ASK for this.  This sauce makes everything taste outstanding- especially the complimentary piping hot pita.  With a tiny taste of Baklava \"on the house\" I am already looking forward to my next visit - on the weekend so I can try the weekends-only appetizers, at an off time to avoid the inevitable crowds."}
{"text":"The middle eastern cuisine , fresh food , quality best and the service 10 / 10.  I spend two hours relaxing environment, water falls and play area for kids"}
{"text":"Come here if you like terrible and slow service when it comes to taking your order and receiving your order. Just go to the Eaton center location. Trust me, you'll be much happier you did."}
{"text":"I love this chain, but this is the second time at this Sheppard location and both times have been less than satisfactory. I thought the first time was perhaps an off day. However this second time confirmed my prior disappoint. The server failed to bring bread to the table and the portions were much smaller than the other locations. The company is great and I would recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"I am big fan of this place. Food is amazing, price is really fair for such an environment and decoration and service is fine."}
{"text":"Pretty nice authentic Middle Eastern food. The bread comes nice and freshly made and it is \"puffed\" - not something you see all the time at middle Eastern restaurants. Hummus as expected is excellent and they have a pretty good falafel. The downside is the place is a bit pricier than average and I don't understand the point of the whole \"order your food here, pay for it, and then we'll bring it to you\" system. Service was quite pleasant despite it being a semi-fast food style restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its a good place for cheap decent Lebanese food.  Their shawarmas and hummus are good, but their tabbouleh is alright, a little too sour for my taste and lacks seasoning.   Their cheese/honey pastries are a must try after a salty meal.   Biggest complaint is the lack of system in the front of house. You have to pick your table, wait til your server brings your bread which can take god knows how long especially if they didn't notice you walk in. Then after your bread arrives, your entire posse has to get up, order their meal from hanging menus, which can disrupt the entire food ordering line esp when its your first time here and you dont know what you want. Once you made it to the register to place your order, they ask you for your table number, which they assume that you have memorized.  Now its time to pay the bill, which adds up after having 3 servings of tabbouleh (their tabbouleh is hella expensive tho) and other miscellaneous Lebanese food, you have to get up and wait in a different separate line from those still ordering food and hope to Allah they didn't mess up the bill (secretly because you cant remember how many manakeeshs you've had.)  But yeah, decent food in a lively setting, will be back."}
{"text":"Rude cooks and wait staff behind the counter. Food takes forever to be prepped and don't even dare ask for an extra plastic fork unless you want the Persian stare of death bestowed upon you.  Oh, food is OK but run of the mill greasy Persian that is a dime a dozen in the area. No need to suffer and go here.  Give your business to owners who appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We've only been there about three times and, to be honest, it's just run of the mill.  I had the beef shawarma sandwich twice and both times, again, it was just average - not too much flavor and could have definitely been more generous with the meat and toppings.   The grape leaves had way to much mint that, whatever other spice(s) they used really contradicted the flavor to the point that it had a chemical-like taste.  On another occasion I had the beef shawarma dinner and they were pretty stingy with the meat to the point that I felt a bit taken.  It can get busy in there and they are very, very slow - not really worth it for just mediocre food."}
{"text":"I crossed over three lanes of traffic as I was so excited Paramount had finally opened.  When I arrived, there were tons of staff on duty, yet few patrons.  Someone had told me to go over to the cash and place my takeout order.  I waited about three minutes while the cashier explained something to one of the servers.  She finally took my order - just a beef shawarma wrap ($7.00+).  Like most Paramount locations, I asked if I should go and tell them what I want on my sandwich but she said just to wait in the other lineup and they'll serve me.  I waited behind this other couple for about 15 minutes (no joke) to get my shawarma - keep in mind they were six guys behind the counter and all the food looked prepared.  Finally, I asked one of the servers if I could tell them how to prepare my sandwich.  He panicked and said, \"oh, quickly tell me what you DON'T want on it?\"  I advised that I didn't want lettuce and tomatoes.  I heard him go over and tell them three times, \"no lettuce, no tomatoes!\"  Anyway, when I finally got it, it felt light as air.  Got home and there was not even a touch of tahini, hot sauce, onion, garlic sauce nothing - just a teensy bit of meat and a tons of pickles; it should have been called Pickle Shawarma with the meat being the condiment.  AND by the way, they put tomatoes - what if I was allergic???  It wasn't even wrapped properly - just folded (see pic).  The little bit of meat was kind of tough and had no seasoning. The only saving grace was the three pitas that were on the house but what could I eat them with?!?  Although I LOVE food, I'm not really a big eater but I was still hungry.  Bottom line: maybe it's because it just opened but I will NOT be returning until some positive reviews pop up.  I felt extremely ripped off."}
{"text":"3 Brewers used to be my go-to for dinner near Dundas Square, but it's definitely been replaced by Paramount. Last night my friend and I went before an event at Massey Hall at ~6pm. We were seated immediately and salivating even before that. The menu was more authentic than I had expected (note the inclusion of Foul, though only on weekends). I love manakeeshs/manaqishs and couldn't wait to devour some.  The selling point is definitely the complimentary fresh pitas that rise to a puff. We were only able to finish half of one, but I bet it entices people to order hummus. The hummus and tabbouleh also come in a plastic container for easy transport should you have leftovers.   Our meal consisted of the fattoush salad (think garden salad with mint, fried bread croutons and a mediterranean dressing), kishek with owarma (dried yogurt mixed with wheat, tomato, onion, topped with spiced ground meat) manakeesh, a spinach and cheese manakeesh, and 2 mango juices. The whole meal came to $25 including tax, so cheap that it made me want to order some hummus, though my stomach told me no. At the end of the meal one could pour this complimentary bitter dark hot drink from the thermos containers set up by the front, so we tried it. My friend and I couldn't put a finger on what it was (tea or coffee), so we just shrugged it off as a combination of both. Hopefully someone will dispel this mysterious drink for us."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for authentic middle eastern food. Love the shish tawook platter, especially the new spicy kind!  Their apps and fresh breads are always a bonus. Love the labneh with zaatar as well as the plain cheese ones.  The juices are a bit pricey but the portion is huge, so can be easily shared.  Family platters are ideal for sharing, and sometimes they will even substitute the meats for all chicken, if needed.  Overall a great place for a delicious meal! So much more busier now than before, so always give yourself some extra time to find a table, especially if you're visiting the Erin Mills location."}
{"text":"Nice place by Cumberland place. After we had sat down, we were given two HUGE blown up pitas. So we had ordered the eggplant dip to go with it. It had a nice smoked flavour to it but not even garlic taste for my liking so it was just a-ok.  Ordered a chicken shawarma and a mango strawberry juice. The juice was yummy and would definitely order it again! The shawarma - I'm not sure about it. The meat wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. Maybe I need to try the falafel instead next time."}
{"text":"I used to eat often at this resto. Lately their quality of food is going down to the gutter. The only thing that continues to be ok is thier manakeesh."}
{"text":"Awful service. Think soup nazi, but for shwarmas. Linda, at the register, is abrupt and rude, and either hard of hearing or just chooses to ignore ALL the questions I had asked. And the food is not even that great."}
{"text":"Pretty good for this late at night!! Open till midnight on weekends and 11 on weekdays! Real Lebanese and Syrian food! Manakeesh is good and cheap but sick to traditional choices like zaatar and labneh!  Their pretty busy so definitely catch the attention of a server early!"}
{"text":"I dined here with a bunch of my friends. We made reservations in case it got busy and wanted to be guaranteed a spot.   The server didn't even write down our order and memorized it all.   They gave us free pita bread to start off.  It was warm and fresh.  We ended up getting a dip to go with the bread.    My friend and I shared the Mankeesh: beef with cheese. The toppings on it and the stringy cheese was good.   For my entree, I ordered the Chicken & Beef Shawarma, with a mix of rice and fries, served with garlic sauce and tahini.  The garlic sauce tasted AMAZING! The chicken and beef tasted alright, nothing to wow abot."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the bad reviews for this place. I always thought it was more of a sit down fine dining type place til my wife finally took me over the Christmas break. Right after sitting at our table waters were dropped off and fresh pitas and we hadn't even ordered yet. I jokingly said we should just eat this.  You place your order at the counter and then everything is brought to you in lightning speed.  I ordered the Shawarma dinner and we had a bunch of dips for the pita. The dips were great though I felt the tabouli was too minty for my liking. The shawarma dinner was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Overall I would definitely go back and try some other items on the menu as it is a really cool concept and the food was decent. I feel like there is something in the menu that I will really love and with the fantastic service and nice environment it is a relaxing dining experience."}
{"text":"Had the shish tawook. Literally the most expensive item on their menu:( two skewers of chicken with a mound of rice, some veggies, a large puffy pita, little sides of hummus, and somethin else I've no clue.   Looked interesting. The chicken was too dry, no moisture. Might've been cooked way too long. The salad albeit looked and tasted alright. Rice though truly had no real taste..an maybe it's me but I was a tad confused if I was meant to have the rice solo without any accompaniments? The pita bread was delicious when hot, but it was no where near as soft as some of the ones I've had previously elsewhere. As always make sure you finish it when hot, it's quite hard when cool.  All in all I'm a tad disappointed. The reason I've given it 2 stars is that I've had something else there previously, I think it was a shawarma that was 1/2 decent. Quick service and quite nice in the front. I just wish the food would've been better."}
{"text":"Never order a Paramount special drink. The service sucks. It's all about the interior and thats it. I thought it'd be a cozy place but it was super cold in there, had to keep my Canada Goose on the whole time. Servers not helpful. Food is cold, maybe they serve it out of the fridge or what"}
{"text":"Paramount is one of my favourite middle eastern restaurants in the GTA. It is located in an industrial area that can be a little off putting at first, but you will get over it! The only downside is the service, which can be a little confusing for a first timer. So just note that if you are planning to stay, walk in and find a free table. Decide what you want to order and then proceed to the order station, give them your order and your table number. They will then bring your food to your table. Once you have finished, you proceed to the pay station, give them your table number to pay.   If you are ordering take out, you can proceed straight to the ordering station and tell them what you want and that it is to go. You then head over to he pay station with your order number to pay. Then go to wait for your food over by the order station. You can also call ahead to place an order for take out, which my co workers and I have done numerous times. Just make sure you get your order number!  When dining in you will always get freshly made pita bread and hummus. The bread is always yummy! I usually order Shish Taouk which is a grilled chicken usually served as a sandwich. It is made in the fresh pita bread they make on site, also with pickles and lettuce. They also use a really nice garlic sauce on it as well. It is a perfect size for lunch portion.   I have also had their Kafta, chicken shawarma, beef shawarma, and various salads. All of them have been pretty good every time!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Door Dash. A solid 3 see below:  - fries (good but completely unsalted) - okra (way too vinegary) - musakka (pretty good) - grape leaves (excellent) - fattoush salad (good but not enough dressing included) - falafel sandwich (pretty good) - manakeesh (zaatar, excellent) - manakeesh (spicy tomato and onion, excellent! - complimentary pita bread (gigantic and fluffy)  It was all in all okay. I may try them again in the future."}
{"text":"This is the worst middle eastern restaurant out there, the pita they give has no taste, dry as sand and it doesn't come with anything, just another scam to order their overly priced hummus. I have been to their location twice and tried different items on the menu to see what the hype was all about but was extremely disappointed, their chicken tastes like rubber and oils drips from their pita sandwich..gross!! Would not recommend anybody to go and waste their money on this terrible place thats making middle eastern food look bad!"}
{"text":"This is amazing food. Amazing. The tabbouleh was actually tabbouleh. The hummus is good. The pita is cooked right there and brought warm to your table. Just feed me now.  Don't even get me started on the deserts. Those little cakes are just each and one of them a little piece of heaven. If i were you, i would skip the chocolate ones, it's not their forte. But all the traditional middle eastern / north african ones, just go ahead."}
{"text":"I do not usually get to eat Middle Eastern food so I was not sure what to order. Luckily there was a lovely lady that recommended the Shish Tawouk Plate $13.99 which is basically chicken kabob with rice and veggies. You ge two large pieces of chicken kabob and although the meat portion is pretty large I found myself still not fully satisfied in terms of the fullness of my belly ;)  I got my meal to go and had to wait a little less than 10 minutes. Service is top notch. Super friendly and always with a huge smile."}
{"text":"Meals start off with this puffy flat bread which is complementary with meal. Added humiss for the bread. Tasted pretty good. Pointed at the menu and ordered a chicken and beef meal with rice. Instead of getting rice we got fries. Picture clearly had rice. We didn't bother argue it and just ate our meals. The chicken meat was soft and tender. We also got mixed meat meal which was super expensive after looking at the bill again. $22 for fries and mixed meats. Way too expensive. Food was pretty decent though."}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago with my friends...let me tell you  They have the Most AMAZING Shwarmas wraps.....DELISH  I got the chicken shwarma wrap(not the dinner) and so did my friends along with a strawberry drink which is amazing, my friends got mango. i tried their drink and it was also good. We sat upstairs which is really nice.  they have quick and nice staff, had a good time. Really happy with my experience, i will definitely be coming here again soon."}
{"text":"Not very fast, but good food, especially at an airport.  Good kebab/shawarma and a variety of breads or \"middle eastern pizza\".  Friendly staff.  Reasonable amount of seating available, and fair prices (slightly higher due to being at the airport, but not bad).  Probably my default choice if I'm at the airport here and need food again."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Paramount when I lived in Mississauga, ever since my friend Talha introduced me to the Crestlawn location in 2008.  Now that I live in North York, I decided to head to the Thornhill location for some eats, accompanied by my wife on a Monday night.  I get the same thing every time, Chicken Shawarma sandwich and a Sausage & Cheese Manakeesh.  I have been getting this combo for years and do not plan on stopping.  I have tried other Paramount dishes in the past and they have been great too.    What I love about their food is that it is always fresh.  The service I receive from the staff is decent (can get too busy during Ramadan and weekends) but the interaction with Fadi (most regulars know who I'm talking about) is wonderful.  He is kind, courteous, amiable and wants to see customers come back to the restaurant.  All in all, I am satisfied with the food and service and will keep on returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Paramount locations. The staff is on point, from the friendly greeting, to seating you down and getting you a glass of water and fresh baked pita bread.  I prefer to send the bread away, as you still have to look at the menu, see what you're craving for, then get up to order your food at the cash register and then pay for your meal.   The cheese and zaatar is a great appetizer to start your delicious Mediterranean journey.  The cheese melts in your mouth. And, the lovely zaatar spice adds a nice twist to just a cheese pizza.  I love their falafel dish. I usually order it with a side of hummus. I prefer this combo, rather  than the sesame sauce it usually pairs with. The falafel is crunchy on the outside and just deliciousness on the inside.  There is so much to choose from their menu, that you're bound to find something you'll love. You'll be a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for family dining or get together with friends. You are greeted as soon as you enter by the manager/ host and are seated. We went on a Saturday evening around 6ish. It wasn't that busy, but it was probably because of the crazy weather. We received our free basket of steaming hot pita bread right away, which I would send back if you didn't order as yet. Plus, it gets cold very quick, as the restaurant was chilli. This restaurant has been renovated and decorated very beautifully. But, I wish they had done something about the entrance because you would catch every wind drift when someone opened the door. I ordered the lentil soup, which was a bit salty, so it was ok with my side of crispy pita chips. My family raved about the kefta and shish taouk skewers, as part of the mixed grill platter. A must try with the garlic sauce and hummus. So yummy wrapped in the warm pita bread. The side order of fries was not tasty. The rice is probably best. My husband says the falafel are the best he's ever had. And if you want to sample the baklava, they are very kind and generous in letting you try one or two. The baklava was delicious and not too sweet. The washrooms do need to be routinely checked as it was a mess. And because the toilets are automatic sensors, they don't always flush and there were no buttons to manually flush. That needs to be changed.  Overall, I still enjoy coming here and the staff is super friendly, always checking up and making sure everything is ok."}
{"text":"I love Paramount but not this location.  To start, the customer service is poor. They took my order only after the server had to make it known to her counterpart about the latest snap chat conversation.   The bread was made fresh but was undercooked. I ordered the hummus with falafel and the falafel was super salty.  I wasn't too pleased with my experience at this location.  I'll just stick to the mississauga locations, as they focus on quality and great customer service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this location, as the one in Mississauga is really good, but they don't compare. The service is super slow and not welcoming. You have to chase someone for water refills. The cheese and zaatar, was missing the zaatar and the cheese was not melted. My taste buds were disappointed. They forgot our sides, again having to chase someone down to get it. The only thing they did right was the falafel. I guess I'll be sticking with my Mississauga location."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a bite to eat if you're in the area. Not the greatest shawarma or falafel you will ever have but it does the trick. Hummus is very tasty and you get free bread ! Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Not all Paramounts are created equal!  This location has dry meat, small portions, high prices and mediocre service. The chicken shawarma plate was expensive for takeout and the meat was bone dry and tasteless. The salad was pitiful and there was no garlic sauce packaged in with the meal.  If you're ever in the mood for shawarma, just avoid this place. Even the nearby food court's Villa Madina is a better and cheaper option."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Paramount Fine Foods because of the reviews that I read on Yelp. The reviews were true. The food here is great. We had tabbouleh, hummus & meat and the chicken & beef shawarma plate. For desert, we had baklava. Of the two shawarmas, if we return, we would get just chicken shawarma. It was moist and had nice seasonings. The beef shawarma was a tad dry to us.  The restaurant is surrounded by warehouses.  So initially you make think that you are in the wrong location but fear not. Once you enter, select a table and remember it's number. When you order you give the person taking your order your table number. Go to the different stations, there are 4, to order your food, drinks and deserts. Then sit and wait for it to appear at your table. When you are finished, go to the check out and tell them your table number then pay the bill."}
{"text":"I'd heard much about Paramount over the years - with their various locations across Toronto. We came in on a Saturday night and managed to get seated immediately.  The menu isn't overly extensive (a good thing) and we ordered a half-family platter of the Lamb. The platter came with about 6 skewers of lamb, cooked medium, with some garnishes along the side and two large dollops of hummus to accompany, along with rice on the side.  The lamb was cooked well - to about a medium consistency, closer to medium well.  I also didn't notice any alcoholic beverages when looking around and did notice the comment here that they don't have a liquor licence. I think that's ok - focus on the food!   I'd come back and try more menu items. I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food, and this place offered a good selection without frills. The staff was available and attentive too."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner one night with the husband and the place was packed . They have a downstairs area and an upstairs one as well . I ordered a cheese pie and my husband the thyme pie or (man2oosheh) as we say in Arabic , as well as hummus and falafel everything was tasty and great . The ambience wasn't great I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a train station because of the amount of people coming and going but the food quality was great def will be back ."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  While I ate light relatively speaking, this is a happening spot to be back for sure.  2 levels, and busy as heck.  Ordered their hummus and unique pillowy pita bread, a gimmick more than anything but it worked lol.  Could've used more garlic.  Baklava superb, generous with the pistachios.  Flaky and yummmy.  Kat, gorgeous service :)  Amex good."}
{"text":"I love the Yonge street location but this one lacks a certain something.  The service seems hit and miss, and frankly I chipped a tooth last night having dinner there, the tabouli seemed to have a rock in it and when I bit down a corner of one of my teeth broke off!  This is not the first time I have found this, the tabouli feels almost gritty, so I believe they may not be washing the parsley.  I don't think I'll go back to this location and if I do I will never have a salad again.  I really wanted to like it because I love the grilled food but it's expensive for the portion sizes, the service is meh, and I broke a tooth eating there."}
{"text":"The place has good food, with decent portions the only BIG problem is the service. Don't get me wrong everyone is nice but they are very disorganized. The servers don't have assigned tables, they are all running around serving tables on each side if the restaurant. Ended up waiting 45mins for the food and had to complain to finally get it."}
{"text":"This paramount is sad and forgotten. While it is nice to not have to wait in the massive lines like the one next to the Eaton Center, and not have to trek to Liberty Village, this place does not deliver. Service is aloof and inexperienced, forcing guests to seat themselves, flag someone down when anything is required, and having to ask for basic things like water and ketchup (for fries). Also, because of the large size of the place, you sometimes have to get up from your table and walk to the back to find someone. The meat warmers are not always turning (which is never a good sign of shwarma), and it was pretty meh when it came out (Ali Baba's has made just as tasty meals). The french fries were soggy and underdone, none of the food was hot, nor did it taste fresh, and not all the sauces came out when my meal did (if it says I get garlic sauce and tahini, you better believe that I want both if I have not indicated otherwise...WHY WOULD YOU NOT PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT IS EXPRESSLY STATED ON THE MENU AS PART OF THE MEAL?!?!?!)   The place is nice from the outside, but always a ghost town....now I know why...I'd probably sooner go to the fast food one just down the street than back here."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Paramount for a while, but when I finally went it was a disappointment. I ordered the Tabliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma. The chicken was dry and the fries were meh.  Thank goodness there was garlic sauce to dip it in! My friend ordered the Philly Shawarma Pizza which was also kind of dry and unappealing looking.   Not everything was bad. The bread that came with the meal was so delicious - warm and yeasty - and the woman serving us was very kind and polite."}
{"text":"This place needs a good manager. Been here a few times and find the staff are just chaotic, doesn't seem like they've been given good training even though they are courteous - who does what is not clear. Also don't work well under pressure and get defensive with customers. Weird. Food is fine."}
{"text":"*** Please note that there seating setup is different than most places.  You get a table then go up to the back and place your order and then wait for it to come to your seat ****  The food here is really good, the shawarma's are my favourite. The service is fast but the servers will not interact with you so if you like that your in luck.   Definitely a place to check out if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The hummus is my fave.  They also make awesome falafel.  I ordered a mini grill plate with my fiance tonight to share as we were having a late dinner.  They brought us warm pita....so yummy.  Ive had Paramount before but not inside the restaurant so it wasnt sure how the service was going to be.  Pretty sub-par.  You go in..you sit down...you stand up again to go order...then you sit back down...they bring you food...then you get up again to pay....very confusing.  Being in the food, restaurant and catering industry this was very confusing for me but maybe it works for them!  I would definitely recommend this place for the food.   Flavorful.  Plentiful.  Delicious.  Dont count on a five star service though!"}
{"text":"You know what irks me more than horrible restaurants? People who are so easy to please that unless they are physically molested by the chef, they're likely to give 3-4 stars to any and every establishment! It is as if they just got out of prison. Or they were born without taste buds, or ... I dunno... I give up.  If you're looking for this place, start at yonge and dundas. Walk south on the east side of yonge until you are hit in the face with the pungent smell of fremented hobo urine. That would be your clue for the entrance to this establishment. At least that was the case during OUR unfortunate visit.  If you order tabouli, despite my rantish \"tip\", you deserve what's coming to you. Take my advice, and order the manakeesh. Service staff is rather belligerent, and shawarma is off tasting (just like the salad and the pickles.)  The only redeeming part of the whole dining experience is the fluffy right out of the oven pita breads that they bring out to your table. But if you're expecting a bit of olive oil to go with that, you got another think coming. Better smuggle a little bottle in, because dry pita bread is no fun while you wait long and hard for your disappointing and ultimately disgusting shawarma plate.  Any middle eastern place worth its falafel serves fresh pita with olive oil and zaater. But not this one. Though every palate free torontonian keeps handing them out 4+ stars like 4 stars are going out of style.  0 stars!!! Next time I'm just gonna go to jimmy the greek. or any other non descript shwarma place, because it is going to be just as disappointing, if not way way less so."}
{"text":"After my friend talked this place (and its hummus) up like it was Saddam Hussein's presidential kitchen, I was disappointed to find freeze-dry falafel wraps, humdrum hummus, and mediocre manakeesh. The food is simply not that great. My biggest criticism would be that everything was dry. There are great places for Middle Eastern cuisine in the GTA, and this just isn't one of them. On the bright side, it looks freaking fabulous."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Middle Eastern restaurants in Toronto. Always excited to go back. The free pita bread that comes with your meal is amazing,warm and soft, the kaftas and shish tawoks are juicy and the vegetable sides always fresh.The only thing that could make the restaurant better is if they served alcohol :)"}
{"text":"Our family was looking for a great dinner and we found it at Paramount.  Great food without being expensive.  Great variety of Middle Eastern dishes and fresh fruit drinks.  Also, friendly service was a plus.  Will look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and the food has been decent; however, most recently, I went and the quality had decreased. The kofta was not as flavourful, the rice was very bland, they didn't provide any sauces except hummus unless you asked for it (i.e., garlic yogurt, hot sauce). The lettuce/salad also didn't seem to be fresh as the lettuce was dried out. It was quite disappointing and it wasn't even busy as we were the only customers there. The hummus and pita were good but was disappointed with the main meal.  It is a cafeteria-style restaurant with an indoor play area for kids. It's huge and it even has a prayer room for those who are religious. It almost feels like a Middle-Eastern McDonald's. You order your food at the cashier area and they bring it to your table. You can pay at the cash immediately or afterwards at your table. There's no standard way to order or pay it seems like. There are waiters around that you can ask for water or additional items, like sauces, coffee, if needed. The service was a bit slow--it seems like they don't have enough wait-staff.  I'm not sure if I'll return here. I may give it another try in the future but not anytime soon!"}
{"text":"During the grand opening week I was quite disappointed with what I ordered. I was excited to order their Paramount special but left very disappointed. My Paramount special was quickly tossed in a coffee cup. The amount you get in their actual glass and the coffee cup most likely differs. I was quite disappointed to pay $7 plus tax for a terribly presented drink in a coffee cup.  I tried Paramount again recently for lunch with a friend. I ordered the chicken shawarma main course which came with the puffy pita. Food came out fast and fresh. I really liked the pita by itself that I didn't need the hummus. The chicken shawarma was okay. Nothing special. The customer service was good during our visit. Two staff members came around to see how we were doing and how the food was .  I would most likely give Paramount another visit to try something else. Perhaps maybe giving their Paramount special another chance."}
{"text":"Best f-ing shawarma ever! Excuse the swearing...it's just that good!  First off, I have to say that the location of Paramount is very random because it's in a warehouse section. You would think it would look \"warehouse-y\" inside but it's interior is very nicely decorated and well-lit. It was also packed with customers too!  So how this place works is you find a table and then head up to the front and order. The food will then be brought to your table. It didn't take very long for our chicken shawarma and drinks to be brought to us. Who knew shawarma had fries in them? It tasted pretty awesome. Everything was made fresh and even their orange juice is freshly squeezed. After you have finished eating you would head to the counter by the exit to pay. Overall, it cost me about $10 for the chicken shawarma and orange juice.  I would totally eat here again but I'm rarely in the Dixie and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"I haven't had a shawarma in a long time and I didn't want to wait for the Heartland location to open up so I came here for lunch.  As Tina N mentioned in her review, the concept is a bit weird. We were directed to a table with menus so I assumed someone would be taking our order. However, we had to look at the menu and then get up to order and pay at the front of the restaurant. For lunch I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and the Paramount special. I definitely think their drinks are pricey but I was tempted by the picture on display. I spent about $13. I actually can't believe the Paramount special was more expensive than the shawarma =S.   When we returned to our table my chair was missing. This was when I noticed that the floor in our area was quite dirty with food. Anyways, our orders arrived quickly and everything tasted good. The chicken shawarma was a bit of a disappoint because I was expecting it to be stuffed with fries like my previous visits at the Dixie location. The Paramount special was presented nicely and tasted refreshing. I was able to try my friend's cheese manakeesh and it tasted great as well. It was interesting to try a different type of \"pizza\" than the Italian style.  I am looking forward to trying out their Heartland location when they open up. However, my wallet won't be looking forward to it lol."}
{"text":"One star just because some of the food we ordered was good, like the falafel. The worst one was the Zaatar Manakeesh, super dry, hard and cold. Never coming back to this location, the service was terrible! 1- Ordering the food: we told the server that we were going to pay the bill in couples, just to let him know from the beginning to make it easier. And he made a really bad face to that and got our orders really rude. 2- One of the plates didn't come, we asked 2/3 times about and it was always \"coming\". Other tables that came after us were getting their food. After asking once again about the missing dish, it came after everybody else in our table had finished eating. Really disrespectful! 3- We received the bills without even asking for it. Some of us were even going to eat desserts, but it was so rude that we gave up with the desserts.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Ps.: Once I believe that others should not pay for their bad co workers, I'm gonna name our server, because I don't know if the others servers are good or not. The name of our server was Dimitri."}
{"text":"So great, always! Fresh meat and hot food. Love Paramount."}
{"text":"We came here with work and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chicken shawarma in a pita and it was delicious! I will return soon. I'm surprised by the negative reviews, perhaps they've improved their food offerings at this location in the past year."}
{"text":"Driest most expensive shawarma in Toronto.  I took my friend from Montreal there because I actually had a good one there once with interesting flavours.  This one was basically chicken and lettuce..no sauce.. No spice..dry.  very disappointing for an $11 shawarma   The only good thing was the chicken tasted good.  I heard the plates are way better"}
{"text":"Really slow and bad service compared to their branches in the city. The menu is little different, they have jacked up their prices and reduced the portions. Please don't wasted your time and money at this location On T1"}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food, the warm pitas with humus taste awesome. Try the Fateh/laban combination which is sprinkled with garlic and nuts, it is very delicious. The bakalava is also made fresh everyday at most of their locations. The service is very fast and efficient and the staff is very well trained."}
{"text":"This my first review on yelp. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Paramount. I was seated to a table quickly. The waitress was attentive and answered my questions that I had l. She was quick with refilling my condements. She responded quickly to the buzzer system that they have at the restaurant. I would be happy to come back again"}
{"text":"I have been here three times not the same location I think here is alot of hype wih this place the food is absolutely delicious I had the beef and chicken shawarma with French fries I also tried their special drink with nuts mango juice I didn't really like that drink but their seasoning  is on point"}
{"text":"Reliably awesome. Nothing mind blowing (except maybe their desserts!)"}
{"text":"New to Liberty village, this Paramount location seems just like the others. We dropped in unexpectedly and were looking forward to familiarly tasty Lebanese fare.   The place is visually appealing.  And the owner came up to say hello and welcome us. A very nice touch.  The resto was quite empty when we came in and slowly started filling in. I think we had four eager servers.   Food came out quick and the only issue was no dressing on our fattoush salad. But that was remedied quickly.   Overall food was good. No major issues. The chicken was cooked very well.  The rest was ok. I like fries and their fries are always a little underwhelming. Although we liked it we were not thrilled. Perhaps a few small things could have gotten a 4th star but we felt it was a solid 3 this time."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers. Whomever is managing this location is trying to severely cut food costs.    I ordered a chicken shawarma for take out and was shocked at the size. It was $9.00 and the thing was no bigger than the circumference of my wrist.   I've also ordered the fattoush salad with chicken a number of times and the portion was tiny.  When I'm near Yorkville or Yone/Dundas, Paramount is a go-to place for me. It's simple and satisfying. But, this Yonge-Eglinton location is horrible.  You do NOT get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing. There seems to be an issue with my order every time I eat at Paramount. Something is always missed. Sometimes I catch it, sometimes I don't, but it's a very frustrating experience. Doesn't help that they nickel and dime you for any extras requested."}
{"text":"I just need to say that the Fatoush salad isn't really a Fatoush salad. It was just greens with balsamic vinegrette. It needs those cracker bits, man!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this Paramount Fine Foods. I've been to 2 other locations of the same.   This is Middle East foods which I love. Today I had the Chicken Shawarma with a side Tabouli Salad, the chicken was only good (not great) but the Tabouli was very tasty.   Here's the issue...they charged me $16.00 for the meal & only gave me chicken. They charged me an extra $4.00 for the Tabouli!! Not right!!  For that reason...not a do over!"}
{"text":"Busy lunch spot close to Erin Mills Town Centre. Lunch with a friend. Service was both fast & slow. The fast part was we were served bread almost as soon as we sat down. The slow part is we waited & waited to place our initial order. The food was the Beef Kabab w Rice. It was good but the rice was only warmish not hot. This is a do-over."}
{"text":"Dinner here tonite, Nov 7/14. Actually a 2.5 Star. It was ok. I think it was the ambiance that was missing. It was at the mall after all! The food was just ok but far from great. We had the Shawarma Chic/Beef Meal with a side Greek salad & a side Tabouli salad (which was very good). The area was loud & busy & the cook prepared our Chicken Shawarma without asking what we wanted on it...isn't this always made-to-order?? We'd likely go again when it's not quit as busy but it's not gonna make it to the regular rotation."}
{"text":"This was a solid restaurant. We had the following Hummus w Chicken (delicious), Tabbouleh (delicious) Chicken Shawarma Plate (real good) & the Beef/Cheese Zaatar (which is essentially Pizza with beef roping & a crispy crust). All great tasting food with very good service provided by \"Joy\". She was delightful, smiling & polite. She was responsive to our requests & fast to serve. This is a \"NEW\" location (3 weeks old) & it's clean & well maintained so far. This is a do-over for us."}
{"text":"Pretty good food with good service.   We had a group of 11, with split bills so be sure to all order one after another, otherwise some peoples food will come out much later (that's what happened to us)  There's was definitely no shortage of fresh pita bread.  We ordered a couple of Falafel and Shish Tawouk platters, which were pretty good and reasonably priced.  The service was really good too!  Dessert was delicious! - Date cookies and Baklava   were so yummy along side the complementary Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"It was alright.  I ordered the shrimp plate which was pretty good.  My family had the platter of meat and falafel.  I don't eat meat, but they seemed to enjoy it.  The service was great,  our waiter was kind.  The ambience was pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Cousy setting, friendly staff, perfect central location. Had lunch on the second floor. Lentil soup was excellent and came in a very big bowl.  Garden salad was good, crunchy, excellent dressing. Mixed grill plate was so so ( three out of five), big portion enough for two people to share, meet was a bit on dry side. Overall, i would give four for food. Do not order coffee. Terrible, especially espresso."}
{"text":"Cold wrap and fries Dry shawarma barely had any stuffing Rip off - not worth the price Save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Horrible food, nothing is fresh. Really bad service, we've ordered spinach baked pitas and the spinach tested like fish, it was so bad. We told the waiter who didn't seem to care and charged us in full even though we didn't eat the dish. Would recommend to stay away."}
{"text":"Very disappointing This opened in my office building and everyone was excited for some new food options at the shops at don mills 1. Their prices are outrageous for middle eastern food. almost $6 for a tiny, flavorless portion of hummus with some pita is ridiculous. And they are slowly increasing their prices. They've only been open about a month and they've already hiked their high prices to about 50 cents - 1 dollar more  2. The portions are stingy for a middle eastern place - the shawarma is barely half filled - they fill it with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes (filler food) and then put 1 small scoop of meat - the pita is not even close to full and they just wrap it to make it seem like a fair portion 3. they shave their shawarma meat and keep it in a heating box - this makes for dry dry meat  4. everything is sort of tasteless - definitely not as flavorful as other middle eastern places 5. their service is a mess - young waitresses who don't know what they are doing (I've stood at the front cash waiting for take out while 2 waitresses just stand at the computers punching things in and ignoring me) - the waitresses also argue with the cooks and it's just a mess 6. with the open kitchen you can see how stingy they are with portions - they even have signs telling their cooks what to put on a plate - mostly lettuce, 1/2 a radish, 1 hot pepper - it's a joke"}
{"text":"I couldn't give 3.5 stars.  You need to first find a seat then go up to the cash to order.  I thought the service was great and people really friendly.  We ordered the foul, a bean dish that's only available on weekends.  Not foul at all and pretty darn tasty with their fresh bread.  The zaatar and cheese bread was just ok, a bit too much oil.  Kebabs were not bad.  We will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Maybe because it reminds me of back home. It totally feels like a restaurant in Istanbul, with shiny stuff all around, baklavas and other yummy desserts on display and photos of the food...   I really like their beef flat bread. I recommend the mint tea. The appetizer platter is delicious.   FYI they also have breakfast."}
{"text":"Medium quality and less than average taste for not a cheap price. Nothing like real middle eastern food, I would not recommend it. First the table was dirty though the place wasn't crowded, and the waitress took us to the table, and didn't clean it. I ordered chicken shish tawook, it was previously cooked, dry and tasteless. The only good thing was a hot newly baked bread served along with the dish."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place because Shoeless Joe was not open yet and it was the best detour ever. I haven't encountered authentic Lebanese food in such a long time. Kibbeh was nutty, lamby, and delicious. Chicken shawarma wrap was nicely spiced. Of course I asked for garlic sauce on the side. You have to. Baklava and the other sweets were some of the best.  They were nutty, crispy and lightly sweet. Perfect end to a yummy meal."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 yalla special, falafel, mixed grill platter, and a wrap. The wrap  lacked flavor and was very small, didn't really enjoy it. Falafels were good and fresh. The mixed grill was kind of dry, as if something was missing on it.   They gave fresh pita, looks amazing, but the sauce comes after 10 minutes like a tiny dot, they expect people to eat those huge pitas with a pinch of garlic and humus sauce.   The servers did not seem to be too happy , they should be more energetic and welcoming to create a better customer experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Paramount Fine Foods location in Toronto. They have plenty of tables, the employees are really friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. I have been here many times and I never had disappointing experience (okay, except once - they were out of tabouli). Yes, I was here once when the service was really slow but that happened only once. Other times it was pretty fast. Their food is so good, I can't express enough, so I don't mind the wait. Would love to come here more often because other locations I have tried doesn't stand close to Yorkville's location. Or maybe I have been lucky."}
{"text":"Great employees but most importantly great food! They always cook things fresh and make sure you are satisfied! I really like their poutine. I also LOVEEEE eating their salads. I would suggest \"ayran\" on the side as well. If you are a meat eater you can try chicken breasts with rice. If your vegetarian, I would highly suggest the vegetarian falafel."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and the babaganoush/mouttabal they had put in the bag had gone bad. My husband took a bite and thought it tasted rancid and we smelled it and it smelled like yeast. How is it possible that this was served to a customer. I'm 3 months pregnant and what if I had taken a bite? This could have ended so bad, I'm honestly shaken. Just terrible. Next time I will be walking the extra bit to Souk Tabule in the Canary district. I'm so glad the owners saved $3 on not throwing out rotten food and serving it to customers. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Notice how Paramount Fine Foods used to be a 4-5 star restaurant...and now they've dropped to 3 stars, and probably soon less? That's because ever since they franchised all over the place they stopped giving a SHIT about their customers. I decided to give them another shot today and ordered from Just-Eat.ca   The restaurant themselves were supposed to deliver the order, but the driver cancelled, and they weren't able to find a replacement. They didn't bother notifying Just Eat, or anybody, not even myself (customer). They just kept my food on the counter and ignored it. It wasn't until two hours later that we finally figured out what was going on and that I wasn't having dinner tonight. What an absolute disgusting excuse for a restaurant chain. I hope they all go bankrupt. This place is AWFUL, and they are NOWHERE near the standard of Middle Eastern food to be charging as much as they charge, AND be complete cocky assholes who don't NEED their customers. Goodbye Paramount."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying I love paramount. With that in mind this is the worst experience I've ever had at any location. This place doesn't close until 10pm but chairs were going up at 9:15 and the staff were checked out. Food came out incorrectly and they charge for small hot sauce containers & basic pitas which are complimentary at the downtown location. Very poor service experience and the Manakeesh was burnt."}
{"text":"One of the most disorganized placed I have been for lunch.  For a place that has multiple restaurants they should have their act together.. the sandwich I had was completely bland"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5-4*, bumped up for good customer service!  In between this location and the Crestlawn, this one is definitely BETTER!  Why?  First of all, the dining room at the Mavis location is separated into different sections.  Whereas Crestlawn is one large room, so to me, it feels more claustrophobic and zoo-like.  That place is just too busy for me to enjoy!  This new location is busy as well, but patrons don't feel it as much as there is division, various sections to eat at, and they're broken up with the baklava, juice counter, & cash area is tucked away.  AND most importantly, I noticed that there was actually attention paid to customer service and the manager ASKED how everything was as I walked by!  I *don't* remember this taking place at the Crestlawn location.  Other positives: -  order on your own, at the cash, pay now/later - great for families or groups who are looking for a quick meal! -  no tip necessary -  fresh puffed pitas arrive at your table soon after you order, water also served right away -  without asking, the server offered to bring toum (white garlic sauce that looks like lard) for pita, again there is attention to service! - there is also a carafe with free Arab coffee (black) that had a hint of cardamon  Mataboul (baba ganoush) was pretty good, you can taste the roasted eggplant, and see the seeds.    Manakeesh - Good value!  Size of a standard size pita.  Meats were well-marinated, but visually, not very appealing.  Basically looked like cat good spread on top of pita.  I think I'd prefer to order a version where the meat/toppings are mushed up like that.  Perhaps Beef Shwarma or Butter Chicken Pizza next time??  Baklava - Were OK, not as good as the baklava I usually get.  If you don't eat it on a regular basis, you may not know the difference.  Doesn't hurt to try it though as they were like $0.50/pc."}
{"text":"A coupla years back, after a bad experience of being ignored by an employee who was behind the baklava counter, twisting her hair, I was hesitant in going back.  However, seeing how so many Yelpers rave about this place, I decided to try again!  After pulling back a heavy, burgundy fabric curtain and plastic, see-through, truck curtain, I finally found the entrance that revealed a newly renovated interior.  I was very impressed by how \"fancy\" it looked despite not being a full-serve restaurant.  And by that, there aren't any waiters.  You just order the food at the counter and when its ready, pick it up, bring it to your own table.  I wanted to pick up some baklava and I asked a cashier, behind an adjacent check-out counter, for help.  As I was asking questions about certain baklava, she was very patient, and even offered me a sample of one!  I left with 2 translucent, plastic containers of different sweets:  1 with 12 small pieces and the other container with 2 kanafeh desserts.  Total was approx $11, $5 for the dozen pieces and about $6 for the remaining 2 kanafeh.  The dozen baklava is priced according to weight and they can also tell you how much your total will be before you check-out.  Aside I asked the girl if the food was any good and without any hesitation she said, \"Yes\", especially the shawarma, mixed grill, and pizzas.  In addition, after I asked her about the renos, she said that they were done about 1 year ago.  So based on this recent, positive experience, I'm making a metal note to visit again, this time to dine-in!"}
{"text":"Signs of serious decline. Have visited 10 times in the past, this time things were seriously bad.   Food - No flavor, tasted same as frozen and reheated Service - Horrible, non-existent. Even though it was 4 pm and the restaurant was empty, they tried to seat us in the extreme back corner. Wait staff was in a hurry to talk among themselves, not really interested in serving.   Food arrived long before appetizers and bread (had to ask twice if bread was coming)  Will not be going again. Was good in the past, but this experience is enough for us to say bye-bye."}
{"text":"Very expensive. For the amount paid, they give VERY little.   I had ordered the chicken and beef shawarma plate for $15.99. What I received was ridiculously small.. to me was only worth $6 at most. The food was decent. Certainly not worth the price paid...   I have been to other Paramount restaurants and have always been satisfied with the quality and quantity.. but this location was just subpar.  The service was slow and the waitress packing my take out was rude.   Will never come back nor recommend to my colleagues. Shame, as I work only 1 block away."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food! Best in the city. The Mezza Plate is awesome, the falafel is delicious, crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The BBQ shrimp was super flavourful, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis.   I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.  I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again."}
{"text":"Decent chain restaurant, this location is particularly more fancy than the others as it is located in Yorkville.   -Paramount Specials - $7.49 and Jellab - $5.49 (only available at specific location) I prefer the paramount specials more as it is more refreshing. Jellab was too sweet with an overwhelming rose syrup.   -Mezza Plate (Hummus, Moutabbal, Tabbouleh) - $9.99 The mezza plate had equal portions of Paramount's famous hummus, mautabball and tabbouleh. I must say though, out of the 3 dips I was quite disappointed with the tabbouleh (middle) as it had no distinct flavor. Otherwise the hummus and moutabbal (on above picture) were delicious, in particular to the moutabbal as it had a smoky depth that was different than the hummus.  -Yalla Special (fries topped with chicken shawarma, garlic sauce and tahini sauce) - $9.99 Chicken too dry and too little sauce to salvage the dish.   -Saj Beef Shawarma Wraps (served Tabliyeh style with fries, pickles, turnips and sauce) - $12.99 each wrap were packed with plenty of juicy shredded beef - the tortila-thin saj bread was also slightly toasted to get a crispy exterior. The garlic sauce was creamy and had this gooey texture that reminded me of cheese. The acidity from the pickles and turnips were much needed to refresh the palate and the platter also came with a generous portion of fries as well.  -BBQ Shrimp plate - $16.49 Shrimps were cooked perfectly with a slight char on them. The fragrant tomato garlic sauce was the highlight with just a touch of spiciness to oomp'ed up the dish. Just like the the platter above, the BBQ shrimp also comes with turnips and pickles, along with a side of fragrant basmati rice.   -Sh'aibiyat - $3/each  had a crispy beautiful pastry and light ashta cream filling. Seriously, that ashta cream just somehow make everything delicious.. I regret putting a bit too much rose syrup though as the rose fragrance overpowered the pistachio."}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, there's much to say about the service. I have been here a handful of times and at least half of those instances, we have received poor service.   The servers are not as attentive as they should be. My table waited about 20 minutes for fresh pitas to be delivered to our table - all the while the other tables have received their second. My server forgot that I ordered a Diet Coke and I did not receive it until mid-meal.  Hopefully they can change this."}
{"text":"This was a fine experience while in Toronto.  Would perhaps consider it to be $-$$ rather than $$ as there are some very affordable mid-east pizza style dishes on the menus that are quite good and very affordable.  Busy place and certainly the word ambiance would not be used here, but it was a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Leur pain chaud sorti du four est délicieux. Pour le reste il y a rien d'exceptionnel. Le service est bon."}
{"text":"This location was disappointing and provided horrible service. We were surprised to know that they gave full service and were excited that we could sit down, take our time and order our food.   Our waiter (won't name him) came by initially and asked us what we wanted for drinks. We gave our order and he came back with our drinks. He came back 5 minutes later to take our order and asked him some questions about the menu which he proceeded to say he didn't know about the new menu. We ordered  and then we waited. We asked him for the wifi password which he quickly blurted out and left. We tried it and it didn't work. We let him know and he said \"it probably doesn't work then,\" he didn't even bother to check with management. Ok fine we left that alone.   Once our food came out we noticed almost immediately our orders were incorrect. We ordered appetizers which we never received and one of us didn't receive the food until everyone was almost done eating. We didn't even get extra plates or any napkins. We had to get up to get our own napkins and plates. After we were done eating we waiting for the bill and our server didn't come. Literally 20  minutes later this guy walks by and we had to wave him down to get our bill paid. We are regular customers of Paramount and to receive this type of service is appalling and turns you off from ever coming back to this location. To make matters worse the women's bathroom were absolutely disgusting and no one bothered to come in and clean it. Just horrible! Gave 2 stars because the food was alright."}
{"text":"Right across the Eaton Centre and very busy during lunch time. Service isn't anything special. Came here a few times and have ordered the mixed grilled plate, hummus, fattoush salad  and shish taouk wraps. The mixed grill plate was served cold so didn't enjoy that. The hummus and fattoush salad was good and is pretty consistent across all of the other Paramounts in the GTA. The wraps are stingy with the extras like salad, onions etc. Overall good location but good luck with seating around lunch since many people go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible chicken shawarma (I ordered the large). Pretty much meatless, no pickles as described on the menu. I would have returned it but I was hungry and by the time I made it home, I didn't feel like walking back for 20 minutes. Stay away from this location until they get their stuff together... I also saw a manager berate (not loudly but audible) an employee in front of me. This was also a huge turn-off.  Note: This is a critique of the Front Street location by St. Lawrence Market. I've been to the location across from Eaton Centre and the newer Yorkville location and those franchises were like so way better."}
{"text":"I honestly can't comprehend how this establishment managed to rack up 3 stars. The service was absolutely horrid. It took nearly 30 minutes for us to get our water. Actually, let me rewind.  We walked in, and had to wait 10 minutes to be seated even though there were several open tables available. We ordered the Zataar with cheese, but did not receive the Zataar until the cheese had gotten cold (about a 20 minute gap). We also got a salad with falafels. The falafels arrived roughly 10 minutes after the salad.   Both main courses arrived after about a 30 minute wait during which time we were forced to nibble on the complimentary pita (which, thankfully was warm). The management at this joint needs to rethink what on earth its doing having one server wait on 9 tables.   If the food had come warm and on time I guess it would have been passable, but it gets 1 star for the complimentary pita."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd be a fan because I'm not a shawarma person or a hummus person, which seem to be what everyone recommends here. I still have not tried the shawarma, but the hummus has fully converted me! So good, I crave it. I even stopped by to get some for takeout -- but be warned, you don't get pita bread with the takeout :( My other go-to staples here are the sausage and cheese manakeesh and the strawberry juice. I would literally go here any time of day whenever anyone wants to go. I haven't even gotten past the tip of the iceberg.. they have a huge selection of desserts I absolutely must try.  You get seated when you get in, but then you have to go up to the counter to order and pay. Then they bring the food to you when it's ready. It's been mixed in terms of speed of service.. sometimes they are right there, and then other times they take forever.  They have some options for picky kids like pepperoni pizza and such."}
{"text":"Food:4/5 Service:2/5  Upon arriving I used the washroom and found no toilet paper. After I finished I let the wait staff know it was empty ( no problem ) 20 minutes later another customer uses the washroom and I see her tell the staff there is no toilet paper.  45 minutes later I am assisting my friend in a wheelchair in the washroom and there is STILL NO PAPER.   I ask to speak with the manager. I explain this issue and how it shouldn't still be a problem. There were 6 customers in the store at the time-not busy!   He apathetically says sorry and asks how the food and service was. I told him the food was fine save for the Luke warm temp and our wait staff not checking back with us at all. I had to ask 3 servers to refill my water as it had been empty.  I explained that these issues are how bad reviews come about. To the server: i always tip 15%; I tipped you nothing as all you did was deliver my food to me nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Paramount Fine Foods in Liberty Village.  It's a chain and this location has been opened since August.  Gord and I split an order of Hummus with Chicken.  I love hummus and pita bread and this was delicious.  The pita bread is freshly made and was warm when it arrived.  Not only did we finish it but we asked for extra pita bread.  Gord ordered Taliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma Wrap.  He said it was good and took half home for his lunch tomorrow.  He thought it could have been hotter so perhaps it was sitting around for a while.  He also ordered a Jellab.  There was a lot on the menu to choose from.  I ordered the Mixed Grill and thought it was okay.  I found it was a bit on the cool side so perhaps it too was sitting around for a while.  I thought the shish tawouk (chicken) was the best of the meat ... it was tender and tasty.  The beef was a bit bland and had a funny texture.  The kafta (ground beef) was interesting.  The garlic sauce was really garlicy.  It was a large portion and because I had so much of the appetizer, I was full and left most of the rice and bread.  Mario and Mohamed were our servers.  They were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"An authentic Middle Eastern venue in the heart of Toronto. Step past the front door into another world of wonderful aromas, loud kitchen staff and chatty customers. There was a 10 minute wait in Friday night for a party of 7. This is the perfect amount of time to check out all the plates on the tables and food passing by. After 10 minutes you will not need a menu.  The live (charcoal?) grill is piled deep with skewers of lamb, chicken and beef keftas. The bakery at the back of the house produces an endless stream of freshly baked pita.  The menu is geared to groups and large families with plenty of platters for sharing. try a couple of dips (hummus/mutabol)  and pizza's for sharing and then move on to the meat!  Everything is served piping hot, fresh and authentic. Expect lots of hustle and bustle, including small children, wait staff carrying platters of food, and a noisy kitchen...very real. This is not a venue for a first date, but that should be apparent when you walk in the door. There is also a second floor which is quiter, but then again what is the point?!  Great atmosphere, great food and excellent value."}
{"text":"This location changed my experience of paramount.  This restaurant has by far the worst service I have experienced in my life (and I dine out very heavily). Their servers will refuse to make eye contact as it may result in them actually doing any work.   As absurd as this may sound - their shish kabobs and koftas were half the size of all other paramount locations.   The above may aid the franchise owner in comprehending why this is the only restaurant in the vicinity that is empty on weekends."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place! The portions are huge and food is tasty! Service is quick and naan is so yums. Can get pretty crowded - just don't go on Sundays :)"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 or even 5 stars...I've eaten here so many times and have brought friends here after one too many tiring shopping trips. I tried to love this place because there's something about it that keeps me coming back even though each experience has been below my expectations. The atmosphere is nice but noisy and the prices are low.  You can easily feed yourself for under $10. However, I must admit, I've had better shawarma and falafel elsewhere. I was expecting so much in that first bite of shawarma but something wasn't right. I was expecting the shawarma and falafel to be the best I've ever tasted but it sadly didn't amount to much. I've tried several of the manakeesh as well and I'd say my favourite is the cheese & zataar manakeesh. I was sucked in by the allure of the butter chicken manakeesh and it was just okay (think cheese pizza with chicken topping). I also tried the beef & cheese version which I know I'll never order again. The spices for the ground beef were a strange combo and the whole bread was so soggy, I had to eat it with a knife and fork. I feel like the manakeesh could be cooked for longer because the cheese just slid off when you tried the break up the pieces. I love the baklava here and always get them in a take-away box if my stomach has the room.  Now, onto the downsides. Every time I've been here, service has been incredibly slow. Once, our plates didn't arrive until well after thirty minutes so my dining companion and I resorted to staring at Nazeem Khadri's face(s) comically plastered everywhere. It's nice to know he isn't just about hockey but a foodie as well right? Anyways, when our plates finally came, they brought our exact same orders again 10 minutes later. Obviously we turned them down but it was ironic how our first orders came so slow but the order we didn't even make came faster.  One major gripe I have with this place is the use of disposable plates and containers for dining in. The manakeesh has come on paper and styrofoam plates and tabbouleh has come in little plastic boxes. The shawarma and falafel have always been served on porcelain plates. The disposable containers cheapen the feel of any restaurant and is definitely unnecessary garbage.  It's an overrated place but somehow I still like it and Paramount is definitely a better option than the hell that is Urban Eatery."}
{"text":"Portions are alittle small for the price. However, it's a clean and bright place. It was very busy at lunch time. I was surprised that they offered fries along with their cuisine along with an assembly line style serving. Would definitely visit this place again.   I tried their chicken bowls. A bed of finely chopped iceberg lettuce, pickled turnips, cucumber, their chicken fine Lebanese style: it was finely chopped! A nice heaping of their sauce made it the perfect lunch for those looking for something different."}
{"text":"We went to Paramount restaurant on Yonge Street near Dundas on Friday night. Paramount is a chain of restaurant that serves Middle East food. The restaurant was full and the atmosphere was very noisy. Service was friendly and efficient.  Our server gave us hot free pita bread. It was very good. For our apptezier, we had the hummus dish. We did not like it. I think we we're not used to eating hummus. For my entree, I had the BBQ beef. It was okay, but overcooked. My friend's BBQ lamb was also overcooked.  Would we go back? The free bread was great, but our entree dishes we're overcooked."}
{"text":"Came here with a group and had a lot of different items.   I liked the hummus appetizer. The rest of the group and myself didnt enjoy the mains like the shish tawouk and beef and chicken shwarma, it was just really bland."}
{"text":"Dry as dust.  Falafel was flavourless.  I suffer when I don't bring my own lunch to work."}
{"text":"I had a meeting downtown this morning, and had to buy lunch out to take back to work.  I had heard about this Paramount place being like the best ...  Seriously, seriously disappointed - bearing in mind that I cook predominantly Middle-Eastern food at home.  1.  Hummous - way, way too much tahini in there, no zesty lemon flavour and certainly no garlic that was discernable.  For that, one star; 2.  Tabbouli - NOT MADE TODAY - parsley did not have that just chopped, fresh green look.  Probably from yesterday (I hope).  Too much liquid (water?) in there.  For that, one star; 3.  \"Vegetable salad\" should have been called lettuce salad.  A few sparse pieces of vegetables.  The salad was not made today - lettuce rusty.  For that, one star. 4.  Lady who assisted me was not overly enthusiastic about anything, it seemed.  Just goes to show.  Keep a jam sandwich in your purse (!) and don't waste $25 on rubbish.  The salads they sold me were not made today.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place could be so good. The variety of food is overwhelming and they appear to be working hard and the space is an impressive design. However from the door in the greeter mislead us with menus and set us up in the \"casual dining\" area where there is no table service and we found out 15 minutes later. Then we ordered at the counter but the cashier didn't ask what we wanted on our shawarma so we waited at bar where the prep crew ignored us until the cleanup girl helped us out. Otherwise food was good and pita fresh, hummus good and not to garlicky."}
{"text":"Good, quick take out. Available on uber eats or for pick up. Favourites are mixed girl, shish tawook, tabouli salad, beef wrap."}
{"text":"Service is Meh...food really over priced and less quantity better off going to other middle eastern places that provide better quality and quantity food.  Hummus for $5??? Taste just like the kind you buy at any high end grocery store.  The wraps that they call sandwiches are really small compared to their competitors.  Never again"}
{"text":"Was nearby and wanted to have a quick, early supper.I have only been here before with people who knew HOW to order.Was the only repeat customer this visit,so I was on my own for ordering.We sat on the patio,it was a nice day,and the servers were great,didn't rush us at all.  Food was wonderful,and the newbies I brought really enjoyed it.So much so,they're coming back on their own.We ordered a variety to our table so people could experience a sampling of the hand made food.Ended with a variety of their traditional desert.Really like the purity of the combined honey,nuts,pastry.  By the way, the folks with me were surprised at the cleanliness of the bathrooms.  The restaurant should post on their OWN website the protocol for getting food at their restaurant,and now growing franchises if they follow this original location.What a shame to get negative comments because the uninitiated have no idea how to order."}
{"text":"An \"A\" for effort with service and quantity but the food could not be less interesting. The chicken is dry and the hot sauce that was asked for was different only in colour (red) from the provided bland garlic sauce. I have visited their other Mississauga restaurant and found it much the same. Don't get it but that could just be me as they keep opening new locations?"}
{"text":"Best hommus in the GTA - with fresh pita straight out of the oven!  While the meat items here could be improved, the appetizers and the baklava here will leave you coming back for more. Stick to the hommus and the fresh Turkish pidas and your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Visted this restaurant tonight, and looks are decieving! This place looks nice on the inside, but food is bland and tasteless! Ive had better shawarma with more flavour. Chicken was blah and so was the rice! Ali babas is even better then this place."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here recently. We had the mezze plate, fattoush, two falafel, sujuk manakeesh, and a chicken Saj wrap. Plus fresh pita. That was a lot of food for two people...and we ate every bite of it. The food was served very quickly and the wait staff was friendly and helpful. I would happily return again."}
{"text":"I grabbed takeout and didn't actually enter the building so I cannot comment on service or interior at all. The prices in the store are a lot higher than some of the prices you can find of the menus floating around online. They do offer quite a bit of variety of food, which is good.   I ordered the falafel plate which I assumed would come with a side of rice or salad but sadly enough, there was just a pita with my 6 (rather large and very tasty) falafel balls, and some pickled veggies, and some rather limp looking lettuce shreds with a HALF slice of tomato. Could not even pass that off as a salad. There was also some \"garlic sauce\" in which I could neither see nor taste garlic. I'm a HUGE fan of garlic sauce and generally ask for extra but this was just a runny white sauce that actually made the falafel taste bitter for some reason. They also did not give and hummus or hot sauce. No hummus?! Seriously? There was barely enough garlic sauce for the plate itself, so the missing hummus was very disappointing. I had to add my own hummus and hot sauce from home. Good thing I didn't eat there.   Even though everything was pretty disappointing, I have to say the size of the falafel balls were on the larger size and were tasty. They were very dry though, hence the lack of sauce disappointment. The pita was actually very large and soft as well.   The chicken shawarma plate was much more disappointing looking than my falafel plate. I didn't eat any of it so I'm not sure how it tasted but there were just 2 small pieces of chicken, the same pita, pickled veggies, and \"garlic sauce.\" All for the great price of $15.  All of these things considered, I would not order this plate again, considering it was barely proportional and had so much left over falafel with nothing to eat it with. I would maybe go back just to order some falafel and make my own wrap at home. Save yourself some money and go to another great place in this area for less with more food and great quality. Bamiyan is not the same type of food but I would much rather prefer it over Paramount."}
{"text":"Yes! Another Paramount. I'm loving the success they're experiencing, and that is the case because they are doing a good job. This location,  a little smaller than the others, has the usual great selection - staff who are trying their best to ensure they're giving good service, and of course, the child play pen."}
{"text":"it's not a huge arabic menu, but it's good all the same.  the shawarma's aren't great but the manakeesh, the grill, the arayes are all really really good. there's fresh juices, great traditional desserts, and the best part as a lot of ppl will point out, is the fresh bread they keep bringing to you.  better than most arabic places but it is still a different service style (half way between a cafeteria and restaurant).   I have to say one more thing, the portions are great!"}
{"text":"Yes another Paramount! Honestly, they do such a great job I'm loving seeing their success. This location is great and consistent with the others, playpen and all."}
{"text":"The service is amazing so is the food the price are fair as well , be ready to over order when you arrive they have a very large menu  with lots of yummy stuff great for sharing and large groups as the place is big they also have a sweet section which you can order from as well ."}
{"text":"I went on Sat March 12 2016, with a friend to the Scarborough/North York location.    We ordered 2 mains: shish tawouk and shawarma plate. They were both sorta disappointing for the price, quality, & quantity. Although the shish tawouk was fresh and juicy and you got 2 skewers of chicken breast. We had to ask for hot sauce twice (at the counter when ordering and when it didn't come again when they brought the food).   The fresh pita was warm and delicious.   I wouldn't go back again unless I was desperate for quick food. Take out might be better (I.e. Maybe they would give more food for $12-13/each).   Ambience: nice for a fast food middle eastern place. Nice lighting.   I've been a total of 4 times and I find it to be mediocre at best. Thus the 3/5 stars only."}
{"text":"Coming from montreal, our standards are high when it comes to middle eastern cuisine .. I prefer basha or amir, less fancy looking but the flavors are incredible :)!! I felt the bread they give in the begining has no flavor, 1/4 of the bread only can finish the little plastic pot of garlic sauce and hummus ... So youre stuck with 1 and 1/2 pita for basically nothing .. Because the mix grill comes with an other pita under the meats ... The pita at the bottom of the meats usually is all oily and tasty from the meat juice in this case it was dry .. Ive always wanted to try paramount but now its done .. Ill keep my middle eastern cravings for Montreal ..."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor to the Paramount location on Yonge Street downtown Toronto and I happened to be in the North York area for an event. I was excited to see that there was a Paramount close by to where I was so I decided that I would go there. Upon arriving, a friend and I were greeted by a woman who brought us to our table then told us we had to order at the cash register. I found this slightly odd because I'm used to there being servers at the other location. We went to order our food and a gentleman who appeared to be the manager on duty took our order at the register. The man asked us if we wanted hummus or baba ganoush and we said that we would like hummus assuming that it came with our meal.  We finished our order then sat down. Our bread came quickly and we were given a full size order of hummus and then checked our bill and realized he had charged us for a full size hummus instead of giving us the small sized sides that already come with the meals. We told our server that we didn't want this and she brought it back and the manager said he would refund the purchase after our meal. I had ordered a tabbouleh salad with a side of chicken skewers and when the server brought our food I was served a fattoush salad with the chicken so I told her that it wasn't what I had ordered and she brought it back to her manager who seemed confused then a few minutes later she came back with my food. The chicken was not that hot and it was very bland compared to what I generally come to expect when I visit Paramount.  My friends fries were overcooked and borderline burnt and her kafta was very dry. The turnips that they gave her tasted like melted plastic(actually melted plastic) and her meal wasn't even hot either. The woman who was the server came to our table to ask if everything was okay and we both kinda hesitated to answer her because everything really wasn't okay at all. But both being polite people we both said that it was \"just okay...\" And she just walked away without inquiring any further. The manager never once came up to us to apologize for his mistakes or see if everything had been resolved. The restaurant was really not very busy at this time so it wouldn't have been that difficult to check on a customer that you had made a mistake with.  When we had finished our sub par meals my friend then had to go find the manager in order to get a refund on the hummus we were charged for that we didn't even want and he wasn't even the person that refunded the money it was the girl who was the server. I also forgot to mention that while serving me the wrong salad that the server dropped garlic sauce into my lap and on my clothes. Thankfully I wasn't wearing anything nice.  After all of this we were left more than disappointed and I know for a fact neither of us will ever be back. Such an embarrassment to the franchise."}
{"text":"I used to live on the west end and go to the Mississauga one. This one is terrible compared to that one. Gives the paramount name a bad one. Dry and tasteless overall and portions are smaller."}
{"text":"I was too full to move.    Our server was horrible, she was more interested in flirting with tables of men than serving us.  But the food was impeccable and the bread addictive.   I'd certainly go back for more, shwarma or kebab- stick to the classics and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Really tasty middle eastern food. The tabbouleh is one of the best i've had outside of my mother's. Fresh and flavorful and no oil! Great mox with the hummus and warm pillowy pita bread!  Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice place but the shawarma is awful. Dry, chewy and tasteless. Def not going back"}
{"text":"This place was terrible! I waited 20 minutes for the most empty terrible chicken shawarma. It had salad mayo chicken. Thanks guys! Worst money I spent on food. They need more people working there to expedite and increase the quality."}
{"text":"The hummus as good and their bread  was awesome.  We had the chicken and beef dish n that was pretty tasty.  All and all not too bad"}
{"text":"The bread is still kinda tasteless even with hummus and the beef shawarma is ok. The place is quite busy tho...."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed! Keep going back to this place whenever I have cravings for a good shawarma. The fresh pita is great with any dip, my favorites are moutabbal and mousaka. Noticed the Yonge street location garnishes the lentil soup with paprika & parsley (at least the times I have been there)? But this one does not."}
{"text":"I love the food here, the portions are always generous & we are always treated well when we visit. My family & I always make it a point to pass by to come eat here whenever we come down to Toronto. Thumbs up to this place, keep it up!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY OF REVIEW: STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!   FULL REVIEW: In hopes of giving the franchise another shot after my previous experience at the Yorkville location, I agreed with my three friends who wanted to brunch there after we learned that the wait at the other brunch places in Liberty Village exceeded an hour and a half. I refrained from writing about my previous dining experience at Yorkville as I did not want to relive it through yelping.  Here goes! Upon arrival, we were seated at our table. After waiting for 15 minutes, we had to ask  the waitress, who was cleaning the table next to us, if she could take our order. She was surprised at our request and immediately looked anxious. Even though she had a notepad in hand and our orders were far from anything complicated (two coffees, two plates of hummus and 4 fattoush salads), she failed to properly take our order. As I saw the uneasy look on her face, I asked her to read our order to me to confirm. She proceeded to tell me that we had ordered 3 salads. I corrected her and made sure she takes our order for four salads. She made a note on her notepad, nodded and left to punch in the order. Literally 2 minutes later, another server came to our table. \"Can I take your order?\" he asked.   A few minutes later, a couple entered the restaurant and sat right next to us. 15 minutes had passed since we ordered the coffees. The couple had not opened their menus yet, and to their surprise, two coffees and a bread landed on their table. They were ours!!!  Another 5 minutes lapsed, we had to follow up on the state of our two cups of brewed coffee. The manager said that they are brewing a fresh pot.  Let me also paint a picture of other things that were happening around the restaurant while we were waiting on our food, and oh it was a long wait. Three servers had all huddled up over a single table, one was wiping it up, another was taking the dishes and the third one was setting up the cleaned portions of the table. The manager made sure she bossed the servers around in every chance that she had.   By the time we got the salads, I had already lost track of time. The salads arrived at our table and guess how many they were? THREE. I was certain that I'll get mine in a few seconds. But no, we had to remind three different servers AND the manager about my salad. All four of whom assured me that it was on its way. Not one of them actually went and check on my salad or even ensure that the order was correctly punched in. My friends dined, and I was sucking on pita bread for an hour.   You'd think that since we interacted with multiple servers, one of them checked up on us during our meal. BUT YOU'RE WRONG. Not a single soul made eye contact with us outside the times I was yelling \"Excuse me, where's my salad?\", let alone check up on us to make sure we didn't need anything else.   Anyways, excited to get out of the place, we asked for the bills. In the interest of your time and my own, I'm not going to elaborate on the complications that the server faced trying to split the three salads and two orders of hummus between the four of us. After doing 2 trips to the cash, he finally handed us the bills. Mine came up to 11 dollars because I paid for the hummus and my coffee. I gave him a 20 dollar bill. Waiting for him to give me my change, he said goodbye and wished us a nice day. I asked him if I could get 5 dollars back. He apologized and ran back to the counter to get me my change. We waited and waited and waited.  ...And waited. I walked up to the counter, asked him if everything was okay. I also told him if he could give me the change so we could leave and that he could do his accounting stuff later. He said he'd be right with me.   We waited another ten minutes to the point that we engaged in a full conversation about the beer festival happening outside with the guys sitting next to us. I walked up to the counter again. I told the manager that we couldn't stay there any longer as our parking session was expiring soon. The manager asked our server to give \"any five dollar bill\" to me and to sort out whatever problem he was having later. He obliged. The manager gave me a mini box of baklava to thank me for my patience and apologized for the service that we (did not) receive. I hope she reads this review."}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty high - the people I was having dinner with said Paramount is the \"best\" Middle Eastern....well, it was certainly not bad.   The interior is pretty nice, with high ceilings (read: noisy) and it's family friendly. They have a dedicated playland so it attracts lots of screaming children. It could be a bit cleaner - our table was a little greasy/sticky but for a casual place, not bad overall.  We started with hummus, which was really quite good - very creamy. It's especially good when scooped up by the fresh bread they deliver to each table. My entrée was shish taouk - basically two skewers of white meat chicken kebabs served with rice, some salad & a garlic dip. First off, the garlic dip is serious, serious business. You will be fending off vampires and everyone else on earth for a good long while after you eat it - unfortunately, you'll need to because the food is kind of bland.  My chicken didn't have much of a discernible spice flavor and the rice is plain basmati rice with no seasoning at all. There is some \"salad\" - shredded, undressed lettuce and a few tomato slices. Meh. Nothing was bad, for sure - but it certainly wasn't great.  We did order a few desserts to try (a sweetened cheese w/pistachios & a carrot something) - both really didn't have much flavor either & the cheese one was rubbery in the way that calamari can be.   That said, it's pretty cheap and convenient and the food arrives quickly. I have to think that there's better Middle Eastern in the GTA but if you expect to essentially have the Panera of Middle Eastern, you'll be good to go."}
{"text":"Since my hotel doesn't have anyplace to eat, I figured I'd grab a bite at the airport before heading out. Well, before security the choices are a Tim Hortons (no), Subway (double no), something called a Swiss Chalet (kind of like Boston Market in the US?) and Paramount. Having eaten at a freestanding Paramount in the GTA I figured it was my best bet for something quick and healthy.  Healthy? Pretty much - I went for an appetizer combo which netted me a scoop of tabbouli salad, some hummus and 2 falafels along with a piece of their giant puffy bread. The tabbouli was pretty \"meh\" - just chopped parsley and a little tomato, no real flavor. The hummus and falafels were pretty bland too. You do have the option to add their \"garlic\" sauce which will keep you immune from vampires (and attractive members of the opposite sex) for a good long while or their \"hot\" sauce. The hot sauce was the best part of the meal for me - a good level of spice and flavor. I slathered it on everything and it really made the difference.  Quick? Not even close. There was one order in front of me and it still took more than 10 minutes to get my food. I know most of what I had was premade and just needed to be dished up, so I'm not sure why it took so long. It wasn't a staff issue as there were at least 6 people back there not doing anything.  Anyway, if you need a bite pre-security Termial 1 and have lots of time to spare, Paramount is probably your best choice."}
{"text":"Okay, I have strong feelings about Paramount so let's get down to it!  Pros:   1- Freshly baked bread served to your table shortly after you get seated 2- A few menu items are consistently amazing. Namely, the manakeesh, the hummus and baba ghanouj, and the shish taook sandwiches. Lentil soup and tabouleh are good too. 3- Some of the waiters are awesome people.  4- The desserts are alright. Could be way better but they're alright. 5- The prices are generally pretty good.  Cons:   1- Location on yonge is absolutely crammed with tables which means there's no space for you or the waiters to stand or walk. Sitting there is uncomfortable at best and extremely frustrating at worst. 2- Extremely slow service during peak hours. Coupled with #1 above, this makes for a miserable time. Do not eat in during peak hours.  3- No delivery. 4- Mediocre shawarma. This is one of the staples in Middle Eastern food and yet, Paramount sucks at it. Such a pity.  Overall, 4/5 because those menu items I mentioned above are really darn good, and because there are no other good Middle Eastern restaurants downtown so Paramount really fills that niche."}
{"text":"The best part about Paramount is the extra bread & coffee. I love the garlic paste, hummus and Manakesh. Though, I feel the bread (khubus) is too thick.   Recently, they have increased the prices of many items. Also, they have decreased the garlic container and the quantity..  I would have given it 5 stars if the prices were good.  Paramount is a good place for family and friends. They don't take long time to serve and have friendly and nice waiter's..  The portion size for mixed grill, sandwiches: chicken, beef shawarma's and kofta sandwich (is large)...Rather two can eat in one sandwich, as it is quite filling!  My best thing, would be just bread and garlic sauce! But, ALAS! the small portions of garlic sauce has really made me REALLY unhappy!"}
{"text":"An UYE forced me to travel across many country borders to this Paramount location in the land known as Thornhill, ON. This was many years ago (well not really, perhaps a month ago?) And here are my field notes:  Food: it was fresh and tasty: the hummus was good, the pita delicious and the kebab platter was very filling and the meat was succulent, but the I was bummed that they weren't serving fatteh or full when we went. Service: was pretty non existent, we had to wait a while for our water, the lady at the cash complained about how busy it was and also implied we shouldn't be tipping much or at all! Company of Yelpers: great as usual and made the schlep totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I went their for dinner today and ordered grilled eggplant dip and spicy beef skewers with rice and fries. The eggplant dip came with hot and fluffy pitas and it was so flavourful with pomegranate seeds. The spicy beef skewers were juicy and delicious. I really like the fact the food came in big portions and total with tax and tip was under $30.00 bucks. Service was quick and friendly. I'll come back here again  to try their baklava dessert next time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not one to complain too often about food or service.  I think I've been pretty lucky up to this point to never have had a disappointing or underwhelming restaurant experience.  We decided to eat at this Paramount location as we were in the area and starving. We have been to the other Paramount locations several times as they're actually quite close to me.   We arrived around 5pm and were immediately taken to a booth. Their patio outside was semi-busy, but definitely not \"summer\" busy. The inside was actually quite empty. As they normally serve pitas as soon as you get in, we figured the same thing would happen here.  Not so. In fact, we took about 15 minutes to decide on our orders. In that time no one came to drop any pitas off, nor did they bring us the waters I had asked from the server who had originally sat us down. My boyfriend went to finally go put our orders in and had to ask again for the pita and water.  The interesting thing is that they had plenty of servers milling about and speaking to one another but not one approached us at any time to ask if we needed anything.   Around 10 minutes later,  my plate came out. I had ordered the shish tawouk and my boyfriend the chicken shawarma platter. I will attach a photo for reference shortly but my plate came out next to empty. In fact, the pitas came out just a moment before they brought my plate. At this point well over 20 min had gone by with no pita or water from when we had arrived. My boyfriend's plate came out a few minutes after mine.  We finished eating and I ended up having to drink his water since no one came around to ask if we needed anything else. The only time they came around was when we had finished eating.   All in all a VERY disappointing experience and I won't be coming back to this location. Not to mention they don't even really have a parking lot, you kind of just have to park somewhere in the back wherever you can."}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  It can be a bit confusing when picking up your take out here.  If I have to pick up a Shawarma, Lentil soup and pizza (group orders)  You will be going to 3 different counters.  Its nice seeing the pizza station as their pita bread are all made in house... and you can view the process.  Than you line up to pay.  Authentic middle eastern food.  Paramount has grown since this location... i see this place now in mall food courts and even the food court all Fallsview.  Parking is limited here.  If full you can park on Crestlawn (street)  NOTE:  If you are picking up for lunch and time is limited,  call in,place your order 15mins prior to picking up your order."}
{"text":"We came here last night, it was completely packed, really nice decor and atmosphere. By the front door there is 3-4 tables (which we sat at one) which was very uncomfortable.  Very squished seating, I felt like I was having dinner with strangers on both side. Cold air was coming in from the front windows aswell as the front door. It was so crowded, ppl waiting  by the front waiting to be seated.    Anyway,      The food.  Not coming back here.  Bread was nice and warm. I ordered the beef shawarma, with fries.   Beef was so dry and room temperature. It was tough to chew.  Was not tasty at all.  If you want doner/kebab/shawarma whatever, not here.   Two stars for decor, service and mediocre french fries.  Response to Karim E. From Paramount Foods: ---Actually no. Staff did nothing of the sort. We were rushed out so the next couple could sit down. ---Left with a bad after taste, and not so good impression."}
{"text":"Good fast service and hot fresh food.  We were impressed with the overall experience and would return if we are back in the area.  They handled the large groups well while taking care of the three of us. Very impressive overall!!"}
{"text":"Bland and as ordinary as it can get. I ordered the Sish Tawook plate. The fries likely were from a freezer bag, the tomato was colourless and the lettuce was limp. The chicken was merely ok.   The whole ordering system is time consuming as well: after being seated you decide what to eat then have to line up at a counter to place your order and pay. If you decide you then want something else (which you won't because the food sucks), you have to get up and line up yet again. The food is food court quality at best.   Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Large portions. Fairly Priced.  Staff are quite responsive to customer's needs.  Food is served at a good pace - Didn't wait too long. The strawberry and mango juice seems a bit expensive and doesn't taste all that special, I would avoid the juice beverage menu."}
{"text":"The place is well renovated and... that's about it. Price is ridiculous for food that isn't even that delicious, was basically complete cold the time I got back to the office. Service aren't all that great. Has a weird take out process. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"So I came back to see if service was any better and to update my review. I spoke to the cashier and told him that I was promised my fries and drink coz they didn't give it to me last time and he accommodated my request. The service from the cook is still lacking a bit. This time he didn't give my food away but instead of attending to my place in line (ticket 13) he decided to do ticket 14 first and then return to me. I would understand that if my food needed to be cooked and while cooking they could multitask but this wasn't the case. While last review I was given a pipping hot pita bread from the oven, this time I was just given a cold flat bread. The other components of the food were ok, nothing to rave about.   So in honestly and imo i'm not having a great experience with this establishment. In bramalea city center if you want shawarma sure come here and I hope your experience is better. But if you are out and want a good shawarma place, i would encourage you to try Osmows."}
{"text":"Food is good; Paramount is worth a visit no matter what location you're near.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We are regulars for mixed platters- this way you get a little bit of everything.  Hummus is a must and the bread is perfect!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and flavourless.  I keep trying to like Paramount as I am a big fan of how they run their business but the food and service is terrible. This is the second location that I've had a really awful experience with. I really want to like this company but I just don't think I can keep giving it chances."}
{"text":"Having heard great things about Paramount I was really excited to try it out.  I called in advance to place a takeout order and timed my arrival based on the instructions of the person who took my order.  I arrived and my order had not been started (a fairly significant issue when you have multiple children in tow).  I waited a further 20 minutes for our order, still optimistic as the dishes that I saw coming out looked lovely. (And no I did not complain or get grumpy so have no reason to believe that the food that I was given was any form of retribution- because yes it was that bad) When we got home not only had they neglected to include a number of items (hummus, tahini) but the food that was there was bland and stale.  The chicken (what little of it there was) was dry and flavourless (I was really missing the tahini sauce).  The plate was 5/7ths rice and a small spoonful of chicken accompanied by some limp lettuce and a couple pickles (which were the best thing on the plate).  The pita, which others have told is fantastic, was dry, hard and stale.  I was so disapointed as I had heard such great things about Paramount.  Hopefully this was an exceptional case but it was bad enough that I wanted to share."}
{"text":"First time here. We went in and did take out. I must say the staff were very friendly and helpful. As for the food we enjoyed our meals and would love to try some different items next time. The place is huge and very clean. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was so happy when this location opened up in Heartland as I lived nearby. I've been there like 4 times now and loved it each time. The atmosphere is newly renovated and looks amazing. Very clean and the staff are extremely welcoming. I've never tipped and still received great service (will have to tip next time, feel bad). I have tried the wraps, but love the chicken and beef shawarma platter. Huge portion but when I'm really hungry, I can easily put it away. It's also great quality and because of the high traffic, you can tell it's always fresh meat. I also love that you get free fresh bread right after you order so you don't wait long at all to eat. The bread with the garlic sauce tastes amazing! Just be careful not to eat too much bread as you'll have a hard time eating what you ordered.   Great food, great prices, great environment and great service!"}
{"text":"By far, the worst Paramount franchise I've been to. The customer service is terrible. You have to remind the servers that you have placed an order to get served. The order over 25 minutes and the restaurant was not even half full. Never come here!"}
{"text":"went here one dinner but the victoria park and sheppard location. mmmmmm - mmm the food is good and light. The kind that fills your belly but u feel light after which makes it just right. I'd definitely be coming back!!! Although I can't remember all the names of the for I ate but it was good , we had that light pillowy bread you tear to pieces to eat, chicken skewers, hummus and I don't know what else ."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place - been coming here for years, way before the secret got out and it went so mainstream :) This is my family's go-to shawarma place. Plus, they're also the only place I've found outside of Kuwait that does a great cheese manakeesh. Things to order here: * their shwarmas * the hummus * their cheese manakeesh * their kenafes * their labneh - with some of their fabulous freshly made pita.... heaven on a plate, my friends.  I guess what I'm trying to say is: GO NOW :)"}
{"text":"Paramount lives up to its reputation as one of the best places for Arabic fast food !  Their hummus is still one of the best I've had, and I love that they will put fries in your shawarma sandwich if you ask them ;) which you should."}
{"text":"This place needs a new manager. Went in with some friends who were getting their food to go. They ordered 3 chicken shawarmas 10 minutes before I ordered and received them 20 minutes after I got my food. The waiter forgot to add the cheese I requested and it had to be sent back to the kitchen. There was also garlic sauce on my shawarma when I specifically asked for none. My gf ordered tabouleh and it never came out so after a while we asked about it and the waiter said \"oh you actually wanted that..\" I don't understand what he was writing on the paper because he seemed to forget everything we said. 10 minutes later he came back to ask us if we still wanted it. We said yes and received the worst tabouleh ever. Our glasses were constantly empty and I had to ask several times through the meal to get more water. This process is pretty simple... remember what people order and make sure a glass of water is never empty. This all happened while the place was empty. There seemed to be a discconect between the wait staff and the kitchen. 30 minutes for a chicken shawarma is absolutely unacceptable. Shawarmas typically takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes ...this is what people expect... if you can't do it then please close your doors. There was also an uber eats delivery man there. He went up and asked for his order four times while he waited for a half hour. How does this happen when the restaurant is empty. The few people in the bar were scattered throughout the restaurant..maybe you should sit people in one section  to avoid slow and confusing service. Overall the food was a 7 out of ten and the service was -100. If things don't change this place will be shut down within a year. There is no way that this place is not a drug front."}
{"text":"I did not understand this restaurant. I was seated, received a menu and then I had to get up, place and pay for my order. When I had to pay, it asked me to pay tip even before I received the food or service. I was not really impressed with the food either, not as flavourful as I've experienced at other Paramounts. Also, the fries tasted like the frozen kind. The Manager did come around and so did the staff asking if everything was ok; however, it felt too much - like they were overcompensating. And, we had to just keep saying everything was ok, so they would leave us alone. Beware they have a kids playground which is good for families, but it felt like we were at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a lot and decided to give it a try. My first and only time here was not a good experience.   Price Range: $8-$18 for an entree (not including tax and tip)  Food Quality(Taste, Serving, Menu) - 2/5 It was hard to tell about the quality of the food because our meal came cold, like it was cooked but pretty cold. I couldn't eat all of it because of that and had to eat something elsewhere after. I could see it being good warm. This place has a pretty big menu with a lot of meat and veggie options. The portions weren't large, they were on the small to average size.  I would say this place for the type of food is pretty pricey for the quality and portion size of food. You can better value for your food elsewhere.  Atmosphere - 4/5 This probably the best part of this place. It looks really nice, has a modern and elegant look. They have a lot of seats, for big and small groups. Parking is really easy to find as they have their own lot.   Service - 1.5/5  So this is where I was unpleased the most. First, this was a really cold day and they put us near the window which was freezing when other seats seemed to be available. This probably contributed a bit to our food being cold.  They took a really long time to give the food, giving only some of our dishes and while we had to wait for the others to come, the food got even more cold. My friend's food had hair in it, like entangled in the food so it was hard to take out. Took us a while to flag down a waiter/waitress to tell them. They were nice about it and when they went to replace my friend's dish, they did it wrong, and we waited about 20 mins for it. She asked for a refund which the manager was really understanding about, and gave us the meat to bring. Though the staff was nice and friendly, it did seem like there were a lot of them walking around and not busy, yet it was still hard to flag them down. I would be worried how long the wait time for food would be when they are more crowded.   Would I go again?  Honestly, the only real positive is the atmosphere as I don't think the food portion/quality for the price is worth it. I want to give them another chance, but a friend would really have to convince me and I'd have to feel lucky that day."}
{"text":"For how much we enjoyed our experiences at Paramount, it's surprising that we have only been there twice. I could blame it on the constant line ups, but I'd have to clarify that the food is worth the wait.   On our first visit, we had a very nice feast for four on the second floor. On the second, we picked up take out to enjoy in sunny Yonge-Dundas Square. Despite the place being packed to the brim both times, we found the service to be efficient and friendly both times.   The mixed barbecue plate was more food than one person should consume. Although we were smart enough to decide to share this, we also couldn't resist ordering an additional tomato onion pizza and creamy babaghanouj. The fresh pitas were puffed right up and served hot to the touch.  Regardless of whether you're eating in or taking out, don't miss out on the desserts sold by the pound in the back. With so many cookies, cakes, and kinds of baklava to choose from, you'll want to try some of everything."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time at the Bay & Bloor location Friday afternoon. I am usually not a fan of hummus, in fact I can live without it, but Paramount's hummus was so good, I was craving it all weekend. I had to have some today. When you walk in they give you piping  hot, fresh flat bread. Their food is very good. They have multiple locations in Toronto. A must try!!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood walking around before we needed to catch our bus to Niagra Falls.  It took us a while to decide what to order and our server, Mack, was very patient with us.  He brought a complementary pita to the table.  We didn't have anything to dip it in so we didn't eat it.  I had the chicken shawarma and my companion had the beef kafta.  Both were good."}
{"text":"The place is new but otherwise nothing special.  Portions look small and food looks dried out. On a second occasion, we ordered something light- justa couple flatbreads. Turns out that they werent making enough money on us and charged us for each hot sauce we ordered. As per waitresses comments, it was because \"we only ordered the flatbread\".   Im done woth inconsistent/unwarranted charges. Its certainly not how to get return customers."}
{"text":"I decided to go according to the reviews on Yelp here.  When I entered into the restaurant, I must say I was impressed with the clean and professional look.   I had to visit the restroom first. The restrooom is quite modern and clean. I also noticed the prayer room, for 2 people. It is good to have it.  I had to stand and read the menu board for a while to decide what to order, and I ended up with ordering beef shawarma platter.Then, I wanted to pay in US dollars, but the cashier said they assume 1 USD = 1 CAD while the fact is 1 USD = 1.20 CAD or so. Their prices are in CAD.  That was disappointing at a place where they serve halal meat !!! It is obviously trying to get more money from the customer for no reason. Not appreciated.  After placing the order with credit card, I was seated and their fresh pita breads were served immediately. It would be a great decision if they can sacrifice a little hummus with those pita breads. Since I did not order a drink, the waitress brought me a glass of water, with no ice and no straw with it.   A few minutes later, my beef shawarma platter was served. Unfortunately I found the meat dry, not impressive at all. The platter came with fries and some salad and turnip pickles. The salad and pickles were very dry too, not looking fresh or yummy at all. That is why I did not touch those at all.  I ate the beef shawarma and the fries. I have been at places that are less professional than this place, but their food was much better.   Not sure if I can get another opportunity to visit this place again, but I want to mention that they have a wood burning oven and they offer lots of fresh bakeries.  I was there for the taste of the food, but I was not impressed with what I had, That is why my rating is just average for now.  I also noticed that they were playing arabic songs. I understand the owners are Arabs, but does this mean they can play Arabic music to their customers and expect them to like?  The music should be more common."}
{"text":"From the upscale outside look and decor you expect a quality dining experience, but that's not really what you get. The pricey Lebanese food (we shared 4 entrees) was okay but there is better elsewhere, and the bland tabouleh was disappointing. Food aside, 2 non-food deal breakers will keep us away.  First, it doesn't operate in the customary sit-down way. You are seated, get fancy menus, see the appealing open concept kitchen, so of course expect a waiter to take the order. But no; it actually operates sort of like fast food. You're told to take the menu to a counter to order and pay like fast food. Staff then serves it, unlike fast food--lots of mixed signals. We didn't bother with dessert, coffee etc to avoid going through that nonsense again. It confuses tipping too, which we skipped as if in a fast food place. Table chat at dinner should not be about how weirdly the restaurant works.   Second, it's Halal, ergo no alcohol. We'd been out for hours on a hot day, looked forward to beer, had to settle for pop or water. This suits their mainly Muslim patrons (judging by dress) but as a courtesy to others there should be a sign at the door saying no alcohol, so they don't only find that out once seated, as we did."}
{"text":"Despite being in an industrial neighbourhood, inside this place had really good vibe and the food was great!! Try the pizzas - made on fresh pita..so good!"}
{"text":"Just got home from a long day looking to eat a larger meal. I got a chicken and beef shawarma platter that cost $18 to go and this is what I got. I've had shawarma platters for half the price that are better than this. Beef tastes like it's been sitting around for hours and the portion is an absolute joke.. I never usually complain but wow.... just terrible"}
{"text":"Fabulous, authentic Middle Eastern food.  Lots of yummy options on the menu.  Great puffed pita.  Marvelous desserts!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second visit to Paramount Fine Foods. I was with 5 friends and we arrived early (11:30 a.m.) on a Wednesday. We were seated promptly and handed menus. Freshly baked pita was delivered to our table shortly thereafter. We sat with our menus for quite some time until we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter to order. No one mentioned this to us and I had honestly forgotten since I hadn't been there in about a year. We were told that since we were all seated at the same table, we all had to pay at the same cashier, which seemed a little silly, but whatever...  I ordered the Greek salad with 2 appetizer falafel balls on the side. The salad was quite good, if a little overdressed. It had plenty of feta cheese and 5 Kalamata olives. The falafel were really great. They were crispy and really tasty. No complaints there.  3 of my friends ordered the fattoush salad with chicken. They all complained that there was FAR too much pita in the salad and that it was a bit greasy (the pita). They also said that their chicken was very overcooked and stringy. But they did say that the salad itself was quite tasty.  1 friend ordered the butter chicken pizza. It came on a paper plate for some strange reason. Other than the terrible presentation, she really enjoyed her meal and said it tasted great.  Another friend ordered the chicken shawarma in a pita and said it was just great. She had no complaints.  All in all, the food wasn't bad, but also wasn't all that great.  The restaurant itself is really large, with a fairly large patio for extra seating. There is also a little play area for children. Even at 11:30 in the morning on a weekday, the place was quite busy and very loud. There were a lot of children running around and being quite rowdy. There was also extremely loud music blasting which made conversation a little difficult.  The prices aren't bad, although perhaps a little high for a restaurant where you have to line up at a counter to order your food (and pay first)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 12:30 Fri Oct 3.... 10 minute wait to be seated.... yes the place was packed.... seating on the upper level.... ordered the mixed platter and each of us received the hot-air-filled pita as well included in the price.... the kabbab, chicken and beef were well cooked but lacking a little flavour....the rice was fluffy and well cooked...was expecting a little more but serving was a fair size....Servers were friendly and prompt with any requests eg. needed a serving spoon to split the rice between my lunch partner and myself..."}
{"text":"We love hummus and are quite particular about it 'fortunately' and this place didn't disappoint. We went here for dinner on a busy Friday evening and it was a long wait.  But once we got a place, things started looking up.  The free pita bread was warm, soft and very filling when paired with Hummus so be careful not to fill yourself up. The Strawberry juice and Paramount Special drink is to die for. Exquisite!  For main course I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate which was unexpectedly oily. And I was confused. Was it Shawarma plate or Fries plate. Give me some more of the good stuff!  But the Spicy Shish Tawouk (chicken) was mesmerizing! Next time, we want to try that loaded platter. I saw those swirling around wishing I was still hungry!"}
{"text":"Not as great as their place outside the Eaton Center but closer to home. So, well, laziness doesn't always pays off.  Quite spacious, plenty of parking on weekend dinner nights. You gotta order at the counter and be served your food at the table. Pay again at the counter. Don't sneak out alright!  Our server and the man in charge, Mostafa was a pleasant dude. Rest of the staff was amicable as well.  Pita bread: Fresh but a bit overdone. Got hard within minutes. Not happy.  Hummus: An alright affair.  Za'atar with Labneh: Quite fine. The yogurt cheese hybrid was fresh and I loved the spicy sprinkle.  Spicy Shish Tawouk: Never disappoints. Try with rice instead of fries. The sumptuous butter is the key!  Took home some variants of Baklava. Economical and enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"What a sorely disappointing experience Paramount is! I ordered a simple take-out meal of inexemplary hummus along with pita bread that smelled like it was baked in a moldy oven, Fatoosh salad with a diminutive sized chicken skewer and a smallish lamb wrap sandwich.   Considering the quantities were not that plentiful my order cost $31 not to mention I had to wait over half an hour for a take out meal that was supposed to take only 15 minutes to prepare, talk about over-priced!  I tried maintaining some semblance of zen composure while staring at the beautiful glass wall infinity fountain to try and obliterate my hangry-ness but seriously when you're sweating buckets because the internal temperature of a restaurant can't be controlled due to heat emanating from both an oven and a wall-to-wall grill and you notice all six people who placed an order AFTER you, got their order fullfilled BEFORE you and you've waited over half a fricken very hungry hour for a simple take-out order it starts to piss you off!  Yes the food (other than the moldy smelling flatbread) is tasty, but surely there's better places for Lebanese fare because Paramount certainly isn't it."}
{"text":"Ambiance great.  Friendly staff.  Food?  Not sure.. been sitting here for 45 min and still have not received our pizza or dip.  I would think dip should have come quickly but.  Unacceptable.  I would expect better from a franchise like Paramount.  Hope it gets better.  -- update --   The owner reached out almost immediately after my post and apologized.  It is their second day of operation, although not an excuse for a franchise of this size.  I was very impressed how they addressed our experience, and were very apologetic.    As an added note, the food was great as Paramount food usually is, and I would recommend anyone to go for a visit.  I will be a returning customer at this location."}
{"text":"4.5  Paramount is an amazing spot for any meal of the day! They have an extensive breakfast menu, brunch, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner - literally anything you could possibly think of.   Paramount has middle eastern cuisine, and a few fusion dishes like their take on poutine and quesadillas.   Came here for brunch on a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The service was efficient and attentive, and the food was fresh and tasty. The ambience was nice, and I was seated immediately.   My group ordered a variety of dishes so I got to try a lot of things. The manakeesh is amazing - you definitely have to get this (I got zaatar manakeesh which is like an Arabic pesto of sorts). I also tried the chicken shawarma fries (like a poutine) and a bit of a shawarma wrap. Honestly everything here is pretty good, you can't go wrong with anything you order. The portion sizes are also pretty good, and quite filling.   You can really taste the freshness and quality of the food. It's a nice spot for a more upscale take to middle eastern cuisine. I'll definitely be back to Paramount soon!"}
{"text":"This place was hopping at lunch time the other day! The line up for take out was insane and every table was packed. So four years after being here since the last time, this joint is still happening. I had a kafta pita with a side of salad and enjoyed both. Our server was pleasant and attentive enough. We came near the end of the rush, so once the lunch crowd took off, our meal was a lot more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mixed Grilled plate with a side of hummus and it tasted great! The service was really good, they were quick to bring out our food. Overall, great place to eat with family and friends."}
{"text":"After loving the downtown location of Paramount, I thought I'd check out this one in Mississauga to see how it compares.  There's plenty of parking at the location and the space is much bigger than the Yonge St. restaurant.  Unlike downtown, there is no waiter service.  We grabbed a table and then placed our order at the counter, giving our table number.  Food was delivered to our table once it was ready.  We ordered the hummus with beef ($7.99). It came with the nice hot, puffy pitas that I love so much.  Also ordered the sirloin beef platter ($12.99) and pop ($1.55 each).  We grabbed 6 cookies from the dessert counter which are charged by weight ($3.45).  It took a bit of time for our pitas to arrive but that's forgiveable because I think they are made fresh.  Beef in the platter was well-done but still very tender and flavourful.  I had ordered a beef sandwich downtown and the beef was still a bit pink in the middle which I appreciated.  Really loved the cookies, although not quite sure of the names.  We got an assortment with dates and a few chocolate ones.  This location of Paramount is bright and bustling.  I also felt very safe eating here because it's located next door to a Mississauga police station and there were a few uniformed officers on their lunch/dinner break."}
{"text":"The Yonge/Dundas area is cluttered with chain restaurants so I always dread whenever someone wants to make plans to meet up for food in that area.  Really happy I checked out Paramount.  It's a brightly lit, bustling place serving up moderately priced meals.  It reminds me of the Middle Eastern version of Futures Bakery.   We ordered the Hummus with Meat ($7.99) and the BBQ Meat sandwich ($6.99).  I was instantly impressed by the hot, fresh, puffed up pitas that accompanied the hummus.  It was so hot that steam sizzled out when we poked a hole in it.  Meat in the sandwhich was done perfectly medium with a small hint of pink in the middle and juicy throughout.  Service was good, no long waits as others had experienced.  Atmosphere is pretty loud, so not appropriate for private conversations or romantic meals but perfect to grab a quick meal in a central location.  Will need to come back and try the sweets and dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, great variety though a little pricey. You can't go wrong with so many Middle Eastern people dining there."}
{"text":"Very good!!!  Excellent lemon lentil soup, butter chicken pizza, and schwarma.  Staff was very nice and attentative."}
{"text":"Took my mum and sister there.. We each has shish tawook and the food was great. They are having a draw for a BMW which i entered in (Fingerzzzzzzz crossed). Anyways there was a great manager there and he was mentioning the sweets (Baklava etc) and gave us a free sample as it was mother's first time at the restaurant. Great service..Great food.."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite middle eastern restaurant. I have been going to Paramount for number of years at many locations. The food is very consistent and service is also good. Last night I went there for dinner at their Thornhill location and they added a play place for the kids. At first I thought it was cool because it gives children a place to play and entertain themselves. However, while eating dinner the atmosphere was very loud from the children and the service was not been taken care of. The problem was the children were screaming during our entire meal and the staff did not provide a pleasant dining experience. My group and I could not hear our own conversations while dining when sitting in the same table due to the unpleasantry. Definitely will not go back to the zoo."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for Paramount which opened a while back at St Lawrence. Went there on a day when we were super hungry and wanted to eat something nice and hot. Went to Paramount after my friend's strong recommendation. Not many vegetarian options compared to meat ones but food was good.... Ordered the Mezze platter with unlimited refills of hot fresh made Pita which we enjoyed.. Also ordered Saaj stuffed with Cheese and customized it with hot sauce to suit our palette.. Enjoyed our menu and left from there feeling full.."}
{"text":"Great kebabs and hummus. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. The free bread is also awesome while you wait for your entree. I'd recommend their kebbeh, manakeesh, and sujuk if you are look for something different.  On the other hand, service is hit or miss, and the location is really crammed."}
{"text":"One of my close girlfriends really like this place so I decided to give it a second chance.    In the past, I always took my order \"to go\" but today we decided to eat in.  I expected poor service but our waiter was friendly and efficient.  The food came quickly (although my schwarma on salad was served long before my friend's pizza was delivered to the table).   The pita bread, however, was served immediately and was piping hot and delicious!  My salad consisted of mostly iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers with a comparatively small amount of chicken schwarma on top.  I say comparatively because I consider myself to be a schwarma connoisseur and I have gone to hundreds (ok, not hundreds, maybe tens) of schwarma places in Toronto so I consider myself sufficiently knowledgeable to be able to compare portion sizes.  I felt that the cost was on the high side for the portion size at Paramount - $8.99 (this entree was not on the menu by the way).  Although lacking in quantity (for my liking anyway) the flavour of the schwarma at Paramount did not disappoint.  The salad was served with dressing on the side (just how I like it) and a garlic yogurt sauce which was divine.  The dressing was so light tasting and delicious I ordered a container of the dressing to go.  It had a balsamic lemony taste and I liked that it was very light on the oil.  All in all, I was impressed with the flavour of my meal.    Based my experience today, I would have upgraded my rating to 3 1/2 starts if I could.  I would have given it four stars if I didn't find the portion size to be on the small size for the cost.    Everyone deserves a second chance right?"}
{"text":"Wonderful place & even the staff seem happy to work there!  Paramount really IS busy around the clock (and NOISY) but that's because it truly IS a fantastic restaurant. Food has always been delicious, portions are generous (so prices are reasonable), and the bread really IS something to look forward to. My family & I have been at LEAST 10 times, never disappointed.  Of course we'll be back..."}
{"text":"The service here was really bad and the food made me sick. I tried to order the half chicken and was told that \"the distributer stopped delivering whole chickens there\" and so I got the chicken shawarma instead... where are they getting the chicken from then?! Not to mention it was $5.99 for mango juice and I was told it was \"freshly squeezed\" (it was not).  Anyways, I have been throwing up all night and I will never be back here. I feel so sick."}
{"text":"I've seen paramount around but it wasn't until one opened up in brampton that I decided to look it up.  On my way home my mother and I decided to stop here as it is right off the highway  Upon entertaining we were greeted and seated. They brought us water and menus and we looked over them. The restaurant is nice, we were sitting right in front of the water fall backdrop. There were a lot of people  eating of all ethnicities and everything looked good. The space is very bright and spacious and the desserts are on display. The kitchen is open and you can see them working away.  Don't make the same mistake we did and wait for someone to take your order. You go up to the front, place your order, pay and then someone will serve you. I think the cashier realized it was our first time and came to say hi. As soon as I started telling him my order he explained the process but he was super nice about it.  We ordered the kibbeh, mixed platter, paramount special drink and mint tea. Everything was delicious. The mixed platter was more then enough food for two people, we just ordered an extra side of rice. All the meat was grilled and seasoned to perfection. It came with salad, pickled veggies, roasted tomatoes and onions. The kibbeh was a good bite size appetizer.  The mint tea was made from actual mint leaves, so comforting. I could use one of those right now. The paramount special is a mix of mango and strawberry juice topped with fruits and nuts- everyone was trying to drink it including my younger brother. We were asked if we were ok multiple times throughout the night, great service.  My ONLY complaint is the food was served slightly warmer then room temperature.  I like my food hot, I want to see steam rising from my plate kind of hot. I would still go back, I'm excited to try new things on the menu. Great addition to brampton."}
{"text":"The western outpost of the Paramount restaurant chain sits just on the south side of the Erin Mills Town Centre.  Though it tries to capture the success of the original Dixie site, it doesn't quite meet the same standards.  It does have a large offering of freshly made Mediterranean cuisine but the staff and flavourings bring down the experience and makes you want to walk out the door.  We walked in on a weekday evening and the host/server seemed to be happy to ignore everyone and just speak to a pretty girl on the wait staff.  We knew that we could go to the counter to order our dinner but it just seemed to be a bit too casual and 'who cares' attitude.  Any question we had was answered by a single word mumble.    After we ordered and sat at the table, we did get fresh warm large pitas.  That was a nice complimentary touch.  The food arrived hot and well sizes so I would say there is value but it just seemed everything was just missing a bit of flavour pop.  The Shish Tawook was not over cooked but not much flavour.  The tabbouleh was missing that citrus punch that makes it bright.  The baklava looked lovely but compared to ones I've had in Dubai, this was one dimensional sugar and a bit of the heavier/soggy side.    This place wasn't bad but certainly not a star place would I would make it part of my restaurant list to go back over and over again.  If they just work on the customer service, that would make such a difference and would be willing to overlook the underseasoned food.  I may need to go back to the Dixie site to see if my memory is too rosy or that the Erin Mills location really isn't as good as the original."}
{"text":"Very slow service which I think has a lot to do with the fact you pay first, so the restaurant doesn't need to work for that tip nor worry about you settling the bill.  My app was brought out with my main which is fine but I ordered hummus as my app, and there was no pita bread to eat it with.  Finally after about 15 minutes we reminded the waitress who said it would be right out.  We saw her bringing out bread for about 3 other tables and most whom had come in after us.   Finally we get our pita bread and dig in....food wise the food is good, not the greatest.    We had ordered dessert and I guess they had forgotten about us as one of the waiters approached our table to ask if everything was ok as we were sitting around for some time after we finished eating so we let him know we were waiting on our dessert.  Another 15 minutes passed and we finally get ONE of our desserts.  We asked another waiter to check on the 2nd and she asked for our receipt and disappeared.    So after waiting 10 minutes we get tired of waiting and go to the front where we tell someone that we've been waiting for our desserts forever and the waitress who took our receipt never came back.  I now see that same waitress at the register and she notices us and pulls out the receipt from her back pocket and hands it to the young lady helping us with some half ass apology.  At this point we're super annoyed - except for the last young lady who got us our desserts (finally) the service was horrible.  We shouldn't have to remind the staff numerous times that we are waiting for food.   Steer clear, not worth the hassle especially when the food wasn't anything amazing."}
{"text":"Came by for take out lunch since it was really busy and there were no seats. There were a few large groups and one person taking up a table for 4, even though the place was relatively spacious. Guess it's first come first serve. Take out was relatively quick (5-10 minutes). Got the lamb sandwich which was just over $10 (no drink), which is decent for Yorkville. It was reasonably sized and the lamb tasted pretty gamey (which I enjoyed!) I have been to the other Yonge location and it was pretty good. Expect similar standards from this one."}
{"text":"For the money Paramount charges, I've experienced better food in Toronto. They are in an advantageous position, because guess what, it's Pearson Airport and you don't have much choice before you pass security. Faced with little competition, Paramount offers so-so food with small portions of protein (chicken, beef, etc.). On top of that, I had to wait **20 min** for my food to be ready. My advice to you is to eat somewhere else OUTSIDE the airport, unless you want to eat at one of the restaurants after you pass security. One good alternative is Caplansky's Deli (http://www.torontopearson.com/PearsonContent.aspx?id=3266##)."}
{"text":"New restaurant location opened up last week.  Had lunch here with a friend today. Place is already busy but at 1pm they were able to grab us a table pretty quickly.  They have a good menu of typical middle eastern dishes, falafel, shawarma, various salads, some burgers, etc. However everything is served and presented more upscale than your typical take out joint.  I tried the fattoush salad with a beef skewer on top. My friend had the chicken shawarma with fries. Portions were large.  Was slightly steep for a quick lunch meal (about $17 each with tax and tip) but there are cheaper menu options (wraps for $6.99) and considering the location (Yorkville) it's on the lower end of things for the neighbourhood.  Food came out fast, which was a bonus. Would come here again, good spot for a casual business lunch or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Tried the branch in Mississauga and didn't like the experience at all.  Nor the food quality. The service was bad too. Not going there again. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Who ever run this location has no clue how the other locations makes their shawarma!!!! Really disappointed of this place."}
{"text":"We went to visit a friend who said that when she's homesick for Dubai, she jumps in her car and goes to Paramount.  That's high praise, and we were not disappoiinted.  The set up here is a little awkward - you are seated for a table, but you actually have to place your order at the counter, and then the servers deliver your food.  Think of it as an upscale cafeteria or deli, with *AMAZING* good.    Do yourself a favor and don't skip the fruit juices - especially the house special fruit juice which is so delightful that you will likely think about fruit juice the same way.  The appetizer spreads- hummus, eggplant- are divine and served with piping hot puffy pita.  I would skip the fattoush which is too close to an ordinary green salad, and instead focus on the chicken taouk which is served with a pungent garlic butter and your choice of fries or rice."}
{"text":"3.5 A brand new, good and not expensive lebanon restaurant (not just another snack or sandwich take-away falafel store), including basic shawarmas but also other and more sophisticated lebanon meals. Service is fast. Place is clean. Great address (but often packed)"}
{"text":"It's clean, it's big, and it's nicely renovated. The food is decent but nothing to rave over. Price and portion sizes are good. The service can be good depending on how busy they are. I'm not sure how to classify this place. It's like Mediterranean-style fancy fast food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday Night and ordered shawarma  and the Paramount special drink. The drink did not come out and we finished our food. We decided to cancel our drink order as we were about to leave and it had not yet arrived. As we were leaving the restaurant, the Manager stopped us and apologized. He asked us about what happened and offered us the drink for free and a free sandwich. This was the best customer service I have seen in a long time!! He actually cared about how we felt and about our experience. The food was also delicious. The shawarma was the perfect size and the meat was moist and tender. And definitely try the Paramount special. It's to die for. It's rating is based on service and food.... And the free pita bread."}
{"text":"I'm torn. On one hand, I was finally able to eat my beloved cheesebread again (aka manakeesh) for the first time in something like 6 years and it wasn't a complete letdown - on the other hand, I had to wait a good 20-30 minutes to get a simple shawarma and cheesebread. To go. What. The. H-E-double hockey sticks. Don't go during peak meal times if you're hungry. Also, the shawarma was a bit off and upset my stomach slightly."}
{"text":"Visited this place multiple time and never disappointed!!! Good & consistent taste.."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The shawarma is always tender and flavoured just right. Their fresh pita bread is great and they have a great range of menu items. Service is usually good, but when its busy they always seem under staffed and if you ask for something extra (a side of garlic sauce or ketchup) it usually takes a bit to get to you. Same with refilling drinks, you have to ask the servers usually (they don't seem to notice on their own). However, if you can look past these tiny inconveniences, the food and overall experience is great!"}
{"text":"Terrible lighting. Not romantic at all. Feels like you are in a food court. Dim those lights"}
{"text":"Ahlan wa Sahlan. An Arabic greeting loosely and metaphorically translated to \"Welcome, make yourself at home\". We were not greeted with this saying, but it makes for a nice opening. I believe Ahlan actually means \"kinfolk\" and Sahlan means \"easy\", implying \"welcome home, rest easy (you're among family)\". Very deep stuff... An appropriate reply to this would be \"Ahlan Beek\"; with Beek meaning \"with you\", it translates loosely to \"I feel at home because I'm with you (among family)\". A gentle reply to a gentle welcoming.  Paramount Fine Foods is a modern stand alone building pretty much in the middle of nowhere. With clean lines and sand tones mixed with deep the browns of the furniture, it creates a warm and relaxed dining environment. We were seated by the hostess with menus and water was brought to us shortly after. The kitchen is visible to the patrons and there is an island bar where fresh juices are made and desserts are displayed. There is also a decent size patio naturally shaded by trees from the mature neighbourhood. Inside there is a micro play area for the kids (see pics), probably good for up to 4-5 yrs old and a great way to prevent claustrophobia by starting them young.  The dining concept here consists of semi table service. Once you've decided on our selections, you go up to the counter to place our order and pay for it. Service personnel will bring it to your table once the food is ready. The menus covered all the basic fares: dips & spreads, soups & salads, wraps, entrées, and family platters to share. But then there was more, dishes using breads like Saj (wraps) and Manakeesh (pizzas).  While we were going through the menu, we were served with fresh piping hot pitas. These were unlike any I've ever had. They were massive, I'm talking bigger than your head massive! Unfortunately they were not served with anything, and when asked, the staff recommended a side of hummus (+$). Since I was going to pay anyway, I opted for Toum instead. I let my family decide the bill of fare for the evening and we ended up with three plates; Fattoush Salad with an added lamb skewer, Chicken and Beef Shawarma with fries, and Mini Mixed Grill with Rice. The Shawaram was served with pickled vegetables, and either tahini (sesame), toum (garlic), hummus, or some combination of them.  Fattoush. One of my favourite salads. I was hoping they would use Saj rather than flatbread; but in the end it was just hope, the salad came with pita. Still, fresh greens and spices, the salad itself was quite good. The lamb skewer I had added also didn't disappoint. Not as tender as I hoped, but gaminess was minimal. 4 stars.  Shawarma. The beef was more flavourful than the chicken, but the portion seemed a little on the small side. The spices were not as prominent and I wasn't able to detect any cumin or tumeric which I enjoy when used in proper proportions. 2,5 stars.  Skeweres. All skewers were grilled over an open flame and were charred nicely. But the pieces were on the small side, causing them to dry out a bit. Shish Tawouk (Chicken Skewer). Small portion (4 pcs). Little flavour. 2,5 stars. Shish Kebab (Beef Skewer). Even smaller pieces than the tawouk! And fewer as well (3 pcs). 2 stars. Kafta. This was cooked nicely, and well spiced, and was easily the best of all the proteins. The only downfall for me with this was that it was 100% beef rather than a beef/lamb mixture. 3,5 stars.  Rice. Long grain white. Cooked nicely, but wasn't buttered... I think I've been spoiled by the homemade stuff from friends... 2,5 stars.  Sauces. These came in small take out containers (1oz). For sauce, that's way too little. Toum. Whipped garlic, EVOO, and lemon juice. Light, white, and airy, mmmm mmmm good! 3,5 stars. Tahini. Slightly on the watery side. Light on the roasted sesame. 2,5 stars. Hummus. Chick peas. Good consistency, could have flavoured it up some to give it a punch. 3 stars.  The venue overall is very good, classy and casual at the same time with the choice of indoor or open air. I love the fact that the area is not busy, and think it's a great place for a date, or just to enjoy a nice summer evening eating out. But be prepared to shell out a few more bucks as they're priced slightly more than other places. To me, these margins are offset by the venue. For this reason, I think I would return. When I do, I'm definitely going to try the Saj and Manakeesh!  The food barely passes the grade to me, I've definitely had better in terms of flavour; however, a couple of non common breads and a great venue is enough to warrant a bump up from 2 to 3 stars.  ila al-liqaa...  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your  company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"I have been here couple times. Everything is nice here. their foods are amazing! Good stuff!  Will defenentl  go there again!"}
{"text":"Came here with kids. Everyone else has received hot pitas and deeps, even those who arrived much later. No water either. I think the servers are nazi, and unless you look like the Mediterranean, forget about good service."}
{"text":"I have now gone to two Paramounts and haven't actually eaten anything. Both of them were understaffed and both times I waited over 20 minutes and no food ever arrived. The second location at don mills and the one at young and eglinton. It's not fine dinning . Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Cheap & fast, this place is always busy.  I tend to order various Manakeesh when I'm dining with friends, but my favourite is cheese with zaatar. I could eat it every day. So glad I work and study close to here."}
{"text":"Was actually recommended this place by my cab driver haha. So I checked it out, why not. Turns out the staff was super friendly, really great, fun, and just overall happy people which was really nice to see. Had a good chat with some of them. The food here is fairly priced and I enjoyed it. I had never really eaten middle eastern dishes before so it was new for me. I had the chicken and beef but wish I went with just chicken as the beef was kind of dry I thought (unless it was suppose to be like that haha). Overall solid place. 4/5"}
{"text":"Big fan for a while, they have really lost their way. Went tonight, service was awful. Forgot water, bread came somewhere in the middle (after asking twice...). Our side dish came before the actual meal.  All could be tolerated, but the food was awful. We didn't finish anything. Not sure what went wrong, but I guess they let the popularity go to their heads."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is good - but considering they are definitely one of the more pricier middle Easten restaurants you would think their portions would be fair - but I don't feel that is so - I bought moutabbal and considering it is 5.99 it should be at least a decent amount - I will try to add a photo to show the quantity - quite disappointing"}
{"text":"Just had the WORST customer service experience at Paramount Foods at Richmond and Spadina.  I ordered online through paramountfinefoodsdotcom which had a link to a site called SkipTheDishes. I prepaid by corporate credit card and received an email confirmation. The counter guy couldn't find the order and said that they only accept orders through JustEat (despite the sign behind him saying \"UberEats pick up). A manager comes along and insists that you can't place an online order from their website because they only offer catering online. I tell him to check. He tries on his phone but quickly puts it away before getting to the \"order online button\" and again insists it's not possible. He refuses to help me unless I can bring back proof by way of screencaps and emails. Meanwhile I have a hungry Stage Manager in a dinner meeting who just drove from Quebec and would like her Falafal wrap - as well as a pizza order to pick up at a different restaurant that is now getting cold.  I go back to work, print off the screencaps and confirmation email and return to the restaurant. The same counter guy argues with me again. Then he checks a second time and mysteriously produces my prepaid order - you know, from the service they don't offer. When I ask for an explanation he talks over me constantly, refusing to listen or explain. Then he tries to blame me for the problem saying that orders from that company (the one they don;t use) have to be verified with a printed email confirmation. I demand to speak the the manager whom he has tio text to find (this place is tiny).  So apparently a new manager is on duty and the one I spoke to did not mention the irate customer who tried to order online and would be returning to pick up the order they found after I left that they claimed not to have received from the company they don't deal with. only now it's a different one from before. This guy again insists they don't take orders through the website (the order I now have it in my hand). I show him the print out of the screen cap of their website with the link. I show him the screencap of the link. I show him the email receipt showing the address of his restaurant and the credit card charged. He stubbornly insists none of this is true. So I'm lying? I ask him if he thinks I went and photoshopped it all. I tell him to go to a laptop and look it up himself. He still insists this is all a lie. He looks it up and... bam. There it is just as I told him. Then he says the restaurant wasn't told they were taking orders through this service (not my problem - but if that's true, how did you find and fill my order when I was off printing?) and that since I have the order I should have nothing to be upset about. No apology and he really didn't seem to care.  How messed up is this company if the managers don't know how they are taking orders or whats on their own website and shouldn't you check when a customer says otherwise before basically calling him a liar? And when you are handed printed proof - shouldn't that be a clue instead of still claiming the customer is wrong? And why is it okay for your staff to lie and blame the customer?  No offer to make it right, no customer follow up, no customer satisfaction - AND THEY WERE IN THE WRONG.  My Stage Manager is now eating cold falafel and I am mad as hell."}
{"text":"I really enjoy many of the dishes and flavours at Paramount. I love ordering zaatar, the fattoush salad, and sharwma. I love the seasoning, herbs and spices in the Zaatar, and find it has just the right amount of the cheese. It is also a good portion size so that you will feel full but not struggle to finish every bite.  I just love the fattoush salad, I love the bright tangy bite of the lemon flavours that make the salad taste just so so fresh and the crunch of the pita pieces just adds a great touch.   The only thing I am disappointed in is that they removed the tomato spicy from their menu and now only offer it as an option with the chicken included. I have a lot of friends that are vegetarian an we all love to each very spicy foods, so it was disappointing that we could no longer order that as the waiter told us that management no longer offers that type of modification in order to keep the menu and quality consistent across all sites. Fair."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma. It was good. It would have been even better if it served hotter (temperature) than it came.   My girlfriend ordered the bbq shrimp platter. It's understandable for BBQ shrimp to taste a little smoky, but these shrimps tasted overly smoky. After talking with the waiter, he offered to switch her plate with something else. She got the shish tawouk plate and it was pretty good.  Overall the food was good and the service was very good. Would go again."}
{"text":"We came here with our friends and I have to say that I was quite disappointed.   We came at a time when it wasn't too busy so we were seated rather quickly but from there things weren't that good.  One thing about this restaurant is that you have to go up to the counter to order and the food will be brought to your table.  When the food began arriving it was all wrong. Our orders got mixed up with another table's and so it took a really long time for us to get our food. When we finally got everything sorted out I found my food to be quite bland.  I wish it had a bit more flavour. The price also is higher here than similar places downtown. I gave this restaurant two stars because we were seated quickly and there were a few waiters and waitresses who came by to make sure things were going well.  Overall I don't think I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Good food, bad set up. Terrible dine in experience. After waiting 25 minutes for a table, we had to go to the back of the restaurant, waited 15 minutes just to order and pay a cashier upfront. There is no service staff that comes to your table. The food was good but they messed up our orders. Atmosphere is loud and filled with kids. Would not go again"}
{"text":"I think by far this was my most disappointing experience at a paramount. Only because I used to be a huge fan of paramount and have noticed them going downhill  Negatives: - portions decreased, prices are the same - lack of customer service  - some kind of confusion for the guy at the cash taking orders on where the line is and who's next. He didn't care who went up.. Even if people cut in front of the person next in 'line'  - forgot to bring out garlic sauce with the chicken shawarma. And took 15 mins to get a waiters attention. They weren't even that busy at the time, 3/4 of the restaurant was empty - no one came by asking for water refill   To be fair, the food had flavor and was tasty. But the cons just seem to out way the pros."}
{"text":"I give a 3 star because of their service. I have been to their 3 locations in the west end and this one has one of the worst service people. The attitude is horrible. Even if you're right, the staff will look at you like you don't belong there. This is not the first time I have experienced this.   The food is great. There's no question about that. I hope they keep up the good work. But management really needs to teach their staff manners and patience. In this line of work you will meet all types of people. It's the service industry. Patience...customer is always right."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Middle Eastern food in the GTA. I have never tasted food so good. This place has changed and gotten better. They expanded and upgraded. The food here is undeniably the best tasting food around. AMAZING!   You go up to the register to order once you're ready and then take a number. The food is brought to your table hot and fresh. I have tried a lot of their dishes and each one is mouth watering and cooked to perfection. The flavor is cooked into each dish. Their dessert area has so much variety that it becomes hard to decide which to get.   YUMMMMMMMMMMM....mmmmmm...mmmmmmm...goooooooood!"}
{"text":"HALAL  This location in Brampton is quite new and therefore, clean and the service is better here than a couple other locations.   The food and portions at this location are also better than what I have noticed at other locations. Maybe it was a good day for the chef.  Overall, I like this place!"}
{"text":"Top notch middle eastern cuisine. The sweets including home made baklava are amazing.   The pita bread is made in house. Only complaint is at times the place is way too busy making service slow."}
{"text":"We were several times at different Paramount restaurants, but this one is the worst one! First of all customers have to order at cashier? Why is this a mcdonalds? ? secondly, all our orders came partially, they forgot french fries , then forgot to add chicken  to the salad . Our mixed shawarma with chicken and meat was awful! We were not able to eat meat at all! We invited our friends to enjoy our food  and time there, sadly we had only very bad experience. Never going to any paramount restaurants... ?"}
{"text":"--- Food ---  My partner and I ordered the Lamb Plate $18.99 and also Yalla Special $8.99. The Yalla special wasn't anything special... just regular fries with tahini sauce (the sauce was kind of thick as well, didn't seem freshly made?). The Lamb plate $18.99 is overpriced I think - the lamb meat wasn't soft and juicy but quite hard and dry... The balsamic rice tasted great though. They give complementary pita breads that were pretty good!   --- Atmosphere --- Interior is great, modern design and clean. Our waitress was friendly. The food took about 30+ minutes to be ready though - a little long considering it wasn't that good.   --- Overall --- It's my first time trying Paramount and I'm not that impressed. I think next time I'll just try their wraps if I come. But we won't get the Lamb plate nor yalla special again."}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern cuisine. Ordered their speciality Beef plates and Beef Wrap. Highly recommend it. Will definitely return next time."}
{"text":"Falafel was very bland and a doughy consistency. The kafta was strangely encased like a sausage and also bland. The beef shawarma was edible. Could do better. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the spicy shish taouk and the staff were friendly / nice."}
{"text":"Amazing bread and hummus. I've had better shawarmas. The patio in the summer is a nice touch. The only annoyance is the wait when they're busy as you have to place your order and the counter. I agree with all the other reviews, this location is far superior than their other ones."}
{"text":"The food was delicious with very large portions (ordered the falafel platter) but service was absolutely horrendous. In short, the lack of professionalism and friendliness of the staff here deters me from visiting again in the future."}
{"text":"This Paramount location is definitely better than the Paramount by Erin Mills Town Centre! We had a party of 5 and ordered a bunch of food to share, such as the cheese manakeesh ($4.99, this is like a flat bread), mezza plate ($8.99, hummus was ok, but I really enjoyed the tabbouleh and the spread made with eggplant), shish tawouk ($6.99, chicken breast wrap, remember to ask for extra garlic sauce), lamb main course entree (2 skewers for $18.99) and the baklava ($28/kg, you can sample before you buy, my fav are the ones made with pistachios and they aren't too sweet). All this cost around $65 and we left with our bellies full! The décor is clean and modern with an open concept. You take a number after you seat yourself, look at the menu, go up to the counter to order and pay, and the food is brought to your table. I love the glass waterfall right at the entrance and how you can see your food prepared at their open kitchen/grill station. There's plenty of highchairs for the little ones and if you have slightly older children, they can play in the indoor multi-level play gym. The entire restaurant is super clean, bathroom included, and the staff was tentative to our needs and requests. I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Took my family here and it was the worst mistake. This place is a joke, worse service I have ever experienced. They seat you down after you wait in a awkward line and then they hand you the menus. After you decide what you want for food, you have to walk to the other side to place your order and get this.....pay for it. I payed and gave them the 15% tip expecting good service.  Food took forever and it was bland. Chicken was over cooked and my family was complaining about the food. They served our food before giving the drinks. I asked the server and told me it's coming soon twice. Finally I got up and asked the manager why our drinks were not served yet. We ate our food and finally the drinks arrived. It's not acceptable for any restaurant to serve food before the drinks. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am not a big fan of Middle Eastern Food, but was forced to go there (just kidding ;-) so perhaps that is why I am giving it a 3 star.  When ordering I asked if my sandwich was spicy and they said: \"not at all\", well for me it was a bit, but then I am ultra-sensitive to any spicy food.  My partner got an upset stomach that night after eating there.  Over all, it was a clean facility and nice decor and the juice I had was yummy.  Service was over all good, although you have to order at the cashier after you sit down."}
{"text":"Wow! Simply amazing!!! For starters, we tried the paramount special which was mixed fruits and mango. It was refreshing. Also, we tried the hummus which came with fresh pita bread. It was ridiculously good. We were eargerly awaiting our entrees. We had both beef and chicken shawarmas and a mixed grill plate. It was the best middle eastern lebanese food I've had in my life. The kafta kabobs and sharwarmas were seasoned well and were delightful. The baklava were homemade. Also, a culinary delight. Wish we had Paramount in Chicago! We came as a group of 10. We all went home happy!"}
{"text":"Love the food at paramount. The two of us ordered the falafel plate, the mouttabal, and the fattoush salad with chicken shwarma. It came very soon after we ordered and the staff was nice and friendly.    I really recommend trying the mouttabal. It's a smokey eggplant dip with olive oil and a few pomegranate seeds. I like to mix in a bit of their hot sauce into it to add a bit of tang and spice.   Like others have mentioned, you need to go up to the front and order. I am always very confused about how much to tip at places like these because you're forced to pay before you experience any of their service..."}
{"text":"If you're in search of a nice sit-down shawarma restaurant with a great decor and ambience, or with more options for vegetarians other than falafel then this may be your place. But for an awesome taste experience there are definitely better places out there (hint: Lazeez). One vegetarian in my group got the falafel while the other got the pizza. The pizza was really enjoyed. I got the shawarma salad, which was meh.  I appreciated the free pitas they served, however it was a bit odd considering they do not provide any dips with it. Their stuffed vine leaves were also really good, and is something I would go specially for since no other shawarma restaurants serve them.  The service wasn't that great as they did not serve water despite me asking twice, and we had to go up and personally ask for a fork.  The only reason I did end up going to Paramount was because both Osmows and Lazeez are closed on Sundays. Therefore, if it's a Sunday and you're craving such food, then sure, go to Paramount."}
{"text":"Paramount Fine Foods is one of those places I really want to love but just everything are falling short in every aspect.  Since I was with a bunch of Yelpers here for a Sunday Brunch UYE, we were able to order a few dishes to share!   Manaakeesh Zaatar ($2.49) - I just love the spices and herbs  Hummus with Chicken ($7.99) - A-ok, but I am never a fan of hummus - Though the complimentary Puffy Pita Bread that comes with it were so good! The best part of the meal!  Mixed BBQ Platter ($69.99) - Chicken, Beef and Kafta which I found them all really bland tasting, dried and cold.. - Though the mixed pickles on the side were delicious...   The complimentary coffee at the end which you can help yourself though is a really nice to end the meal.   Service is non existence, but I don't really mind since it is more like a self served restaurant.  Paramount has the one of the most filthy ladies washrooms I have been to! Seems like none of the staffs ever checked the washrooms for the whole day: toilet paper scattered everywhere and even puddles of pee on the floor... Maybe I went to the men's washroom by accident?"}
{"text":"As a meat-lover, here's the right place for me. Kebabs were excellent and I love the traditional  pistachio desserts here."}
{"text":"My family came to visit me, and when we wondered in Toronto downtown very late. We were surprisingly to fine this restaurant was so popular. Food was big, the meat  was juicy. We all love it"}
{"text":"Really not enjoyable whatsoever.  I ordered a chicken shawarma plate for take out last night from here. The turnips were wilted, the pickles were soggy, the rice had no taste (don't think it was seasoned), and the serving of chicken I got (although tasty) was extremely small.  For $17 this was 100% not worth it. For half the price you could get much better food from either Osmows or Lazeez which are both close by.  Also their garlic sauce is just awful. It tastes like pure mashed up garlic. Way too powerful. You could drop a rhino if you breathed within 50 metres of it after eating Paramounts Garlic sauce.  Super disappointing experience overall especially because the decor of the place is so beautiful.  Stop trying to appeal to everyone Paramount and just concentrate on doing the small things correctly.  Food 1/5 Service 4/5 Decor 4/5 Price 2/5"}
{"text":"Oh paramount..... what happened to you? After patronizing Paramount since its opening on Crestlawn Rd in Mississauga since 2002, I believe the glory days are gone. It really was an icon in middle eastern cuisine.   I recently went to the Paramount on Front Street and ordered a Fattoush Salad with Chicken on the side for a total of $13.something.   Let me fist say that the staff was EXCELLENT. Professional, courteous and very welcoming.   The food on the other hand..... abysmal would be a compliment. 11:39 AM is when the chicken is just cooked, it should be fresh, the little caramelized pieces of fat crunchy and the chicken moist. This was NOT! It was a small rotisserie with what appeared to be chicken from the previous day. The chicken was dry. While the salad appeared fresh, it came with no dressing! Just the crispy pita and leaves with peppers and one slice of radish.   I recently went to Paramount on Yonge as well as the one at the Airport and noticed the quality diminish since the glory days but never THIS bad!.   I absolutely do not like writing this bad a review for this place because I have always liked Paramount but I feel that I unfortunately have to. Please do better so reviews like this change!"}
{"text":"I got the unsual... fattoush salad with the chicken shawarma on top before flying out to Cuba. I have to compliment the lady who went out of her way to get me the caramelized pieced of chicken on the rotisserie!!  While this would not be my ideal choice, for airport food, I would probably eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer Paramounts. It has a beautiful dining room with pretty chandeliers. There is another section tucked in the back with a mini play-place for children. For this reason, we always bring our little family here. The food is halal and plentiful. For 3 adults and 2 kids, our go-to order is half mixed-platter with fattoush salad and rice on the side. We like the variation that it provides with all the types of kebab and shawarma. We get the moutabbal to start which I scoop up with their warm pita. It's delicious! If you're coming here solo or just with a friend, their wraps and plates are also good if you're not looking for anything too big.  Service has been excellent here and the wait staff is good about filling water. We've reminded them that we needed warm pita on occasion, but they've always brought it out happily. Food comes out relatively quickly as well. I like the way they organize it, just like Five Guys or Panera. If you're dining in you'll order first, pay, and then get your food. Just let them know your table number and after a short wait you're served up some delicious Middle Eastern grub!"}
{"text":"It's a general go-to when I'm by the Eaton Centre.  The food is warm, delicious and filling.  Meat and rice are a staple for me so this is the perfect meal. The complimentary warm pita offered is a nice touch of hospitality.  I recommend ordering the Moutabbal (egg plant) to scoop up with the warm pita. I've had their beef shawarma in a wrap which was a little dry when I ordered it.  Also, it was overpowered with meat and I couldn't taste very much of the toppings.  I personally wouldn't order their shawarma. However, I would definitely order their plates with rice.  I ordered their beef and chicken shawarma with rice.  It included garlic and tahini sauce on the side.  The chicken is definitely more moist than the beef, but I was able to apply the sauce as generously as I wanted. Very well priced for such big portions!"}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened..then went though a rough patch and is now back on the up.  A busy lunch place weekends it is also pretty popular.  You order first then go to your table.  While your supping the complimentary yummy coffee with cardamon your dishes are delivered to your table.  Portions are pretty generous and the freshly bakes pitas are amazingly good.  Kibbeh have really deteriorated to a packages product but the shawarma is pretty trustworthy.  Manakeesh is a nice taste with the lentil soup."}
{"text":"Service, Service, Service. Something the management at this location seems to have forgot all about. I went to this location back in May, first time I've ever been to any Paramount, and the experience was a nightmare.   So first, they ask you to pay a tip when you order, before you even sit down... weird but i figured what the hell and paid anyway. First mistake.  My friend & I grab a booth and wait..and wait. After 20 minutes go by, I ask where our water or pita is, and was told it was \"coming\". 40 minutes go by from when we ordered and finally the waiter drops off the food, but only 1 plate! No explanation as to where the other plate is but that it's \"on the way\". 15 minutes go by, friend was almost done eating, and after asking 2 waiters where my food was, with no clear answers, the attentive hostess comes by to check on us. When she found out I still didn't get my order, she apologized and rushed into the kitchen to prepare me a plate and bring us our water. She must have alerted the manager because he came by our table shortly after, not to apologize, but to blame ME for the food taking long!!  I couldn't believe it. After explaining to him what happened, this guy's excuse was that since it was not paid together, and paid separately (right after one another), is why it came out at different times, even though it's the same table (???).   Honestly if it wasn't for the hostess, I don't think I'd ever get my food, and if I wasn't so hungry I would've asked for a refund. Needless to say the staff and management here need serious re-training. This Paramount doesn't represent the great experiences from friends that have gone to the one downtown and near Dixie & Eglinton.   A single star given for the hostess, but I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"The food here was A+ . First time I've been to this location, but not the last. Everything was fresh, waiters paid attention, and the food was delicious!  I had the Shish Tawouk w/ rice + sides, everything was freshly prepared and the pita bread was fresh out of the oven. The chicken was juicy and tender and went well with the side of garlic sauce.   The Paramount special cocktail was very good. The $6.99 price tag was a bit too much to have again, but it's good enough to try at least once.  Definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review has nothing to do with the food, but rather an exceptionally poor service experience we had.   Alright ... so, we went back to Paramount two weekends ago, and the service failed miserably.  We ordered our food, hummus, falafel, fattoush, okra, lentils and rice ... and Lebanese pizza for the kids.  Hummus was brought out with no pita. Rice was brought out with no lentils. Falafel never made an appearance.  A server came by, we made mention, and he said it was on its way.  No dice.  Then we complained again, and he said \"Oh, they never brought it?\"  He sent the lady who took our order over to see us, and she made some lame excuses as to why the food never arrived.  I said, \"don't bother ... just bring us the bill.\"  Then, the nice gentleman who took care of us during our last visit came by ... he seemed upset about the situation, and removed the items that never arrived.  He did send some nice sweets to the table.  I also said that we shouldn't be charged for the rice, as the lentils never made it ... and we didn't touch the rice.  Well, he forgot and still charged us for it.  I told the cashier, she said, \"Oh sorry,\" but then still charged us for it.  I think that they should have done a better job of making up for ruining our dinner.  We left dissatisfied.  I really love this place, but I am apprehensive about returning.   If Doctor Laffa were open on Saturday nights, they would be getting my business moving forward.  Well, Paramount ... how will you win this customer back?"}
{"text":"Poor taste and service just looks nice but so many better tasting places. They seem to keep opening new locations out of greed but no focus on food or service"}
{"text":"Below average taste for middle eastern food. Sooo many better Places out there. Paramount looks nice and the owners seem to be trying to grow the business too quick not focusing on quality and service..... Greedy owners"}
{"text":"Paramount Fine Foods is a popular Middle Eastern and Mediterranean chain of restaurants with several locations in Ontario. They offer an extensive menu of Middle-Eastern dishes, and now they have expanded even more so by adding six new items.   One of the new starters is the mezza plate, which is perfect to be shared between two people. The Hummus, Moutabbal & Tabbouleh ($9.99) - equal portion of our famous hummus, moutabbal, and freshly prepared tabbouleh, was a great start to dinner. My favorite out of the three was the hummus, which had a nice cream texture without being runny.    Did you know that Paramount Fine Foods also has an offshoot food truck? The Yalla Special ($9.99) - fries topped with chicken shawarma, garlic sauce, and tahini sauce, is one of the items available from the truck and is now available on Paramount Fine Foods Yorkville's new menu. This item is like a rendition of poutine (not a poutine though) but with more of a Mediterranean flair. The fries are topped with a generous portion of chicken shawarma, and drizzled with creamy tahini sauce.  The BBQ Shrimp Plate is the first seafood platter to be added onto Paramount Fine Foods' menu. So naturally, it was the item that I was looking forward the most to try. The BBQ Shrimp Plate ($16.49) - 2 skewers of marinated shrimp served with basmati rice, tomato garlic sauce, pickles, and turnips, arrived with several pieces of plump yet lightly-charred shrimp. I highly recommend getting this dish, as it's well-priced for the large portion that you get, and was delightfully tasty.   Paramount Fine Foods Yorkville continues to offer an extensive choice of fresh, healthy, and high quality halal menu items. It's an ideal place to grab a quick bite at lunch, or have a dinner with family or friends. I stand by my earlier review, and believe that it's a great addition to the thriving cultural district of Yorkville. Paramount Fine Foods is open Sunday to Thurs from 8 am to 11 pm, and Fri and Sat from 8 am to 12 am."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, although the ordering is a little goofy.  You sit, look at a menu, then go down a corridor to order, then a waitress brings it to your table.  Tipping is unclear, since you've already paid when you order.  Food was quite good, but over-priced.  I'd eat here anytime, but if I had the choice, I'd pick one of the myriad of other little kebab/ shawarma places in the area."}
{"text":"First off, we're talking about Mississauga here.  In my opinion, I think this place overexceeds the expectations that usually come with \"Mississauga restaurants\". It's very authentic food and atmosphere wise... okay, let's get started with the review!  Food: I've been several times, and there are three sections to Paramount. One is the shwarama/hot plate area where you can get falafels and other Lebanese hot foods such as that.   The other section is the immense sweets selection that they have - delicious and a large variety of standard Lebanese sweets.  The last section (and my favourite) is the manaakeesh section. Manaakeesh (sorry for misspelling if so) is like a mini pita pizza but with Mediterranean spices (such as zaatar or labneh) and other toppings. It's cheap - $3.5 is the most expensive for one, and you get about 4 slices per manaakeesh (think pita!) If you are not familiar w/ Lebanese food, I think this is a great experience because you can go with a few friends and order a few of these \"pita pizzas\" and share and taste the different spices used. It's cheap too, so it's not going to break the bank.  I've also had the \"special juice\" and it's delicious, but heavy!   Atmosphere wise it's a bit food-court-esque where you have to go up to the counter and order. When you do, you give them your table number and then they'll bring the food to you. It's not a \"romantic\" or \"classy\" restaurant by any means, but it's clean and the food is good.  Paramount is one of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga to go to - for new experiences w/ friends or as a regular restaurant go-to."}
{"text":"Ordered th beef shwarma. Was kind of dry and skinny on th beef. Was here 7pm on a tues and th front bar area was vacant but had dirty dishes. Not licensed for alcohol."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here before! I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad!?.. The staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant is very well kept! The food is amazing and affordable! I like how it's like so laid back and there is no pressure to rush! My boyfriend and I once sat here for a good 3 hours! I always get the shawarma salad or shawarma plate!  It's got a playground for kids in the back that is inside of a glass room so you can't hear them screaming or \"having fun\".  There is also a prayer room which I thought was so cool!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the driest shawarma I've ever had.  No garlic sauce whatsoever.  Sujuk was good though."}
{"text":"Very good Middle Eastern food. Plates are very big and probably it is worth to share. For sure I wanna go back to try different options."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but it has been a while and my boyfriend never tried it, so we decided to give it a go.  I just think the set up is very odd. The fact that you order your food at the counter \"fast food style\" yet there is a waitress who comes and brings your food and is there to grab you drinks and what not. It's either one way or the other - in my opinion.  We started with the hummus and pita. I'll give them 5 stars on their delicious fresh pita bread. Seriously you can see the smoke coming out of it once you break int it. Noms.  The hummus was delicious and very creamy.  I got the chicken shawarma and a side of fries and my boyfriend got the beef and chicken shawarma plate - on the rocks with salad and fries. My shawarma was a little bit underwhelming, it wasn't nice and full as you'd expect a shawarma to be. The chicken was flavourful but I think they over did it with the spices. It was OK though.  My boyfriend enjoyed his plate but also agreed that the seasoning was just very powerful and not in a good way. It was just too much. They need a lighter hand when seasoning.  Overall though, the atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly and attentive. I may give them a try in the future."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE ! Been coming here since they opened and they always let us dine in before 9:45 today I walked in at 9:30 and the cashier (Azhar) said we can dine in then he changed his mind suddenly and didn't let us dine in. After requesting nicely a few times he started getting aggressive and being rude we told him we won't order anything and leave & it didn't even bother him he said go ahead and leave. I will never ever come here again in my life worst customer service since the beginning all the workers are horrible and don't try to help a customer. I'm definitely going to tell all my friends and family to NEVER come here again.   They definitely need more friendly workers and better customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Fresh food and always on time. Can't ever complain, awesome customer service also!"}
{"text":"Six of us met here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. I had called to make reservations for 11:45am and was told that a reservation wasn't required, as Wednesdays at that time was not busy. I'm glad we arrived on time, because by noon the place was fairly busy. What is most striking about the place is the architecture of the building itself (on the inside). The upper dining area (where we were seated) was spectacular. Exposed wooden beams, warm colours with an open atmosphere...it is really quite stunning. Our server dropped by a few moments after we were seated and we ordered an appetizer while we decided on main courses. We opted to go with the Mezza Plate, which was hummus, moutabbal and tabbouleh, all served with fresh bread. It was devoured almost as quickly as it was put down on the table. It was delish. Two of us ordered the Tabliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma. It's chicken shawarma in pita (an ample portion size) served on a wooden board with fries, stuffed with lettuce, pickles and garlic sauce. It was fantastic. The garlic sauce was VERY garlicy...just the way it should be. I'd go back for this dish alone. Hot sauce was very good....I didn't find it overly spicy but some at our table found it exceedingly hot (some in our group found the garlic sauce had a heat to it due to the high concentration of garlic...but trust me...it is fantastic). Another person at our table ordered a Manakeesh....a middle eastern version of a pizza. She loved it...although she has a very low tolerance for spice and it had a great kick to it...so she turned beet red while eating it...but ate every morsel of it. I can't recall everything everyone else ordered...but not one of us was disappointed with our meals and all of us mentioned we'd come back. Our server was excellent..she was attentive, made recommendations and ensured that we all enjoyed ourselves. On the main floor you can purchase sweets to go. Highly recommend this place....."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but I'm not sure this is a good branch of Paramount. I love paramount fine foods esp the newly opened in yonge and bloor. This branch lack some stocks on lamb so some of us needs to change orders."}
{"text":"Alright the food here is good. It's healthy not too spicy and nothing shouts processed here it's fresh. So that's all good.   But ....  The only paramount location I enjoy eating at and feel content is Yorkdale. It is only that location that  gives you good amount of meat (chicken or beef shawarma/plate) in proportion to what you pay. I was excited when Vic park and Sheppard opened the location but they skimp out on the meat and their portions over time have got a lot smaller. Same with the shops at don mills location. Paramount has gone from quality and quantity to plainly money-making."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for food since St Lawrence market was closing.  This place looks really fancy I was still let in with tshirt and shorts.  Service was pretty fast at first, they brought bread and my appetizer quickly.  Then my wrap was brought within 10 minutes which was just in time but my friend had to wait longer.  I was done with my food before he got his.  Then after we ate it took another 15 min to get our check and pay.  The food was great, I got the hummus and chicken shawarma  and I would eat it everyday if I could. The reason why I rated this place a three because of the time to get my friends food but also the time it took us to pay and receive our change.  I believe this place just opened so I understand but it needs to be staffed better."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I wasn't impressed with the food at all.  I ordered a falafel plate and the waiter mentioned it didn't have rice.  Just falafel and salad which was $10 which I thought was not cool.  Most places charge that for rice and salad and the falafel.  Also the quality of the food was not so great.  I wouldn't come back for sure."}
{"text":"Well. This isn't the first time I've been to any Paramount. And it won't be the last. I'm not sure how to explain it. Its probably the Lebanese in me. They are always average and occasionally above average. But lets be honest. People are complacent. They will go to a place they know is average instead of taking a risk at a place that could be great or awful.   --- Food ---  The Falafel are amazing. Beyond amazing. I decided to order the most un-middle eastern thing I could to see, and was slightly disappointed. The chicken burger is not something you should be ordering when going to an ethnic place to eat. Stick to the shawarma or any of the foods you cannot pronounce, odds are, you'll enjoy it.   --- Service ---  The servers were relatively attentive but the fact that my water came 20 minutes into sitting down, after food, was something that sort of stumps me.   --- Overall ---  Good place to grab lunch if you are in the area. Not as high end as I'd have expected for being in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"For such a nice looking restaurant the service is rather weird. You get seated at a table with menus (remember your table number!). You're told that once you're ready to order to go up front to order. What happens if you have a lot of people? Does one person go up and remember everyone's orders? Do you go up separately? It's just a really weird system for what I was assuming is a sit down restaurant. I suppose it's a bit like Nando's.  The food is okay, nothing to write home about. The hummus is very good though. I've had the falafels, the lamb platter, the butter chicken pizza, all of which were pretty unspectacular. The pita's pretty cool as it comes out piping hot and full of hot steamy air but it cools very fast and once its cooled its not that great.  Service is stale and robotic."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Would come here more if they made whole wheat pita,  but the grilled meat is awesome.  Baked desserts are wonderful also."}
{"text":"We arrived on a weeknight a group of three, the ambiance is nice and service was good.  The food however was not satisfying for the price, very little meat in the the wraps both the beef shawarma and saj beef wrap.  We ordered the dip trio and it was just ok."}
{"text":"Delicious food as always at paramount fine foods. Tried their cheese man'ouche at terminal 1 Toronto Pearson airport and it was great especially that it's freshly made in the oven in front of you."}
{"text":"the shwarrma was dry, falafels were ok, pita bread was awesome. meh! I have had better"}
{"text":"Hummus with chicken or the chicken shawarma or the regular hummus with bread or pretty much anything else on the menu. It is a good place to eat if you like middle eastern fast food. Consistency in taste and good customer service. Fresh bakhlava!"}
{"text":"Paramount is mediocre at best. I don't understand how they are at four stars. This may be considered \"Arabic food\" to most people who aren't middle eastern, it's far from it. No flavour in the food at all. They mask it with garlic which is extremely overwhelming. Also, the manakeesh there is extremely oily. Definitely not authentic Arabic cuisine."}
{"text":"Make sure you look through your take out order before leaving. I have ordered take out several times from this location only to arrive home with the incorrect order. Over priced, poor service, untrustworthy. Avoid at all costs and go and get real, quality middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food!!! Never ate anything I didn't end up loving! Try it and you'll know what I mean! Yuuuum!! Try EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Lebanese food. Had 1 friend growing up who was Lebanese and her family always had a best food.  I think the concept of Paramount is great and something that we need in Irvine. Prices are high but we had a huge family dinner and they more than accommodated for us. Food service was fast.  Pros: *Jajik was really good, lots of garlic *Lamb kebab also really good. *Bread...I am not a bread person but I could eat this bread all day. *Hummus is the bomb. *Family platter: everything on it was good.  Cons: *A bit pricey but you have to consider that this is casual fine dining. *I think they could work on the presentation of the platter. The lettuce was very wilted and sliced tomatoes seemed old. *Rice was not good...it needed something."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever left a restaurant feeling this angry. Not enough servers so everything was very slow. By the time my salad and halloumi arrived I discovered the halloumi was uncooked, even though it said grilled on the menu. Took a long time to get the server's attention. She first tried to argue that it was already grilled (it was just the dressing that discoloured it). Then she took it to manager - came back 1min later and said manager says it's supposed to be this way, sorry.  So I didn't eat my meal and they wouldn't take the time to cook it and decided to charge full price anyway. Will never go back."}
{"text":"2.5 stars round up to 3. This is a new restaurant in this plaza. Restaurant is nice and clean. Service was friendly. I had a chicken shawerma sandwich combo with salad and drink. Sandwich itself was a bit small and not a whole lot of meat. The salad was delish; lettuce and other toppings were very fresh and nice crunch to it. Salad complimented sandwich well.  My husband had the Koofta entree. Portion was smaller than expected; it came with 2 ground beef skewers, rice, half pita and hummus. Meat was good; pita was a bit soggy; and rice was bland.   Overall, nice interior decoration, good service; but portions are a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"While the hummous was phenomenal, the tabouleh was not as fresh and the falafel were a bit salty. We were served by Kayvan who was quite enthusiastic."}
{"text":"It's right across Eaton's Centre. Perfect place for quick lunch. We ordered the $39.99 mixed grill platter to share for 4 people. Interesting combo platter of skewers of sirloin steak, kafta, chicken, grilled onions and tomatoes. Comes with basmati rice, wonderful salad, hummus, French fries etc.   Fast friendly service. Overall enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Taste: 5/5 Service: 3.5/5  I heard about Paramount from a friend of mine who said \"they have the best Lebanese food outside of Lebanon.\" As my friend grew up in Beirut, I took his advice when I was in the area with a few of my friends looking for a lunch spot. This location on Younge street is very accessible from the TTC in a busy part of town.   Our group was seated and orders were taken promptly, however we had to ask for water after being seated for roughly 15 minutes. I like to think that water should be always be served regardless of what else is ordered as it's a basic necessity of life. My philosophies aside, the fresh-baked huge pita puffs were served with speed and our orders came out rather quick as well.  We started with the manakeesh with cheese and zaatar ($3.99) which had more cheese than I was expecting, similar to a pizza. I shared a beef and chicken shawarma plate ($12.99) that featured pieces of meat on top of a soft pita with all the shawarma fixins (turnips, pickles, lettuce, tomato, tahini and garlic sauce). You have the choice of either fries or rice. I asked for a side of their homemade hot sauce, it appeared to be chunky Harissa with a nice subtle kick. The dish is sufficient enough for two to share or one if you're really hungry. The paramount special ($6.99) is a refreshing drink with mixed fruits and juices. Although refreshing, I didn't find it worth the price personally.  If this restaurant existed in Buffalo they would easily have the best shawarma in town. With their three locations in Toronto, Mississauga, and Thornhill, I would highly recommend Paramount if looking for tasty middle eastern chow!  *Don't forget to ask for a side of their hot sauce*"}
{"text":"Very close to our place. Decent food, we order often since not many UberEATS options in the area. The fresh bread with hummus is delicious and free !! I like their beef shawarma roll and fatoush salad. Hubby likes the zataar though I don't enjoy the taste."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to any Paramount location. I hadn't read any of the reviews prior to dining there, but I'm glad to head my experience does not reflect the quality of Paramount as a whole.   I went here with two friends after visiting the Christmas Market. It wasn't too busy, but there were a fair amount of customers. We waited for a few minutes before we could be seated. Service was lukewarm, but that could be accounted to how little employees there were. The location looked nice at least.  Food was okay, I guess. The bread was the best part of the meal, which... sounds disappointing now that I'm writing it out. I got a shawarma dish, and it lacked flavour and was quite dry. The only thing I could taste were the pickles which I found out I couldn't stand, so I ended up picking them all out. I used the spices on the table to eat the rest. My friend's soup was quite good though, and the pizza she got was average. It was the butter chicken pizza but failed to really taste like butter chicken.   I don't live near here, and to be honest, there was nothing special enough about this place for me to warrant a return even if I was passing through the area. However, there is a Paramount closer to home, so I guess I'll have to dine there sometime soon to see how the two locations compare!   This place deserves a 2.5 at best, but I'm going to boost my rating to a 3 just because it's not awful enough to be a 2. When will Yelp introduce half stars?"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, it looked very fancy and nice with a waterfall at the front of the store. The server was friendly and it seemed less crowded compared to the one beside Eaton Centre. There are significant differences and the main thing that I had a problem with the fries were stale. It makes me think what else is not fresh at this establishment.   Everything looks clean, but it definitely was missing the paramount vibe. The hoops was great, a little blackened but that could be an everyday kind of thing. The food was lukewarm. I had the mini grill set while my partner had the chicken Shawarma plate which was very dry. It was not crispy and tender like it should be.  Of course, they did address the issue of the stale fries, but I had already lost my faith and I will not be eating at this place again. Its a shame, because I had really enjoy eating at Paramount on Yonge."}
{"text":"Excellent food made with fresh ingredients. Good service, but can get busy. Falafel wrap was very good, as was the labneh plate. Very clean restaurant and bathroom. Manager came by to see how things were going. Highly recommended. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Customer service is really bad and shawarma barely had any meat. Teach your staff basic manners when dealing with customers such as saying please and thank you."}
{"text":"I don't know if the cooks at paramount have changed but I stopped by here with a colleague for lunch and we were both amazed by our wraps! I had the falafel wrap which had pickles, turnips, onions, lettuces, tomatoes, hummus and tahini. It was the perfect size and the flavours were amazing. My colleague who had the beef shawarma didn't think beef and pickles would go together but he said it was amazing.  The reason for he 4 stars is because there is only one waitress during the lunch hour. There are a lot of people that stop by here for lunch with large tables. Although she can balance well, I feel like she could use an extra set of hands. Our drinks weren't topped up but she did follow up (when we were done our meal) to ask if we enjoyed everything.  I would recommend this place only if you have at least an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Paramount locations and I would have to say that this has been far the worst.   Like most Paramount locations, you have first choose a table to sit at, walk up to the counter to order, pay for your meal and tell them which table number you are at, and then the food will be delivered to you.   My friend and I ordered the Mezza Plate to share and the pita was brought out within the first two minutes which would have been great but the actual dips did not arrive until almost 10 minutes later which meant that the out a was not as fresh and had cooled a little. Furthermore, unlike other locations where the plate comes with TWO pitas, this location only gives you one. My friend's order if falafels came out another 15 minutes later and it was good but didn't have as much veggies on the side as places like Me VA Me.   We waited another 30 minutes and my Yalla Special had still not arrived. My friend had to go up to the counter to ask where it was because employees don't come by to check on you in this location. We were told that we hadn't ordered the fries but we both clearly remember asking for it. We had to order again. The fries came out and I could hardly see ANY chicken in the dish which was extremely disappointing. It was basically a plate if fries with tahini sauce. For $9.99 that is a ripoff."}
{"text":"I can make a meal out of the fresh baked pita bread and moutabbal.  I am crazy about their moutabbal. The prices are very reasonable and it is centrally located right  next to Dundas Square.  It is very informal so if you are coming excepting a fine dinning experience you are in the wrong place but the prices on the menu should console you.   Overall, as a fast and inexpensive option with a strong menu it gets 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out for dinner. She had never had Arabic food before and she really liked it. The falafel was delicious! The service was very slow but our waiter was very helpful."}
{"text":"Got my table within 5 minutes but the server took around 10-15 minutes to greet. Another 10-15 minutes for water and the food was at least half an hour. Manager checked in when the meal was almost finished and the server is busy running around tending to all his other tables. There are lots of helpers walking around filling water and clearing tables but clearly not enough servers. Manager seems to be glued to the expo like for 90 percent of the time. I think the service is completely unorganized and the food was horrible. I ordered the beef and chicken shawarma plate. The tahini and garlic sauce were good but the beef and chicken shawarma were very dry. It's my first time coming here but definitely not coming back. Would not recommend the beef and chicken shawarma at all, you can get better quality and price from the usual shawarma places."}
{"text":"Very very slow. When we finally got our food, the tabouli had no salt or lemon, and they forgot our main course. We waited 45 minutes for them to tell us sorry, we missed your order. It was the only damn main course!!! Manager is horrible as well."}
{"text":"We got an invite for a second dinner and everything was great. Fast service, good food and they had bread."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch.  The restaurant was not very busy and like many other reviewers our service was slow.  We ordered a hummus to eat with the pita bread which is supposed to be served hot but was barely lukewarm.  The hummus was decent but nothing special.  We ordered their falafel appetizer which was served hot and was definitely the highlight of the meal.  We also decided to share a small meat platter between the two of us.  Again this was served to us lukewarm.  The kebobs would have been good if they were actually warm and the sides (tomato, lettuce, pickles) weren't gross and wilted.  Honestly I really don't understand how Paramount continues to expand and have a customer base as the only thing consistent about their restaurants is bad service and mediocre cold food.  No more."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch with a Lebanese friend of mine. Very nice place. Very clean, friendly service and the food was excellent. Tried a couple different pizzas. The spicy sausage pizza was my favorite."}
{"text":"Expected a true paramount service. Was disappointed at the quality of food and service. Took around 20 minutes to get our food and it didn't taste fresh. No humus included in the plate since when? Also the heat was broken.... disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Over the past year, there's been a lot of new or expanded restaurants in/around this same area offering Middle Eastern food - but this one has stood the test of time! Over the years, this restaurant has expanded too, been renovated, and even opened other locations such as the one in downtown Toronto across from the Eaton Centre!  But this Mississauga joint is still a regular spot for me and my friends whenever we're craving some humus, fresh pita, grilled meats, manakeesh or shwarama. We've been coming here for years!  ATMOSPHERE: Very casual. Restaurant is large, but it seems to be always busy! So grab a seat as soon as you get there. It's very lively there. Can get loud, but means it's great for large parties. Washrooms are clean and modern as well - very important. And there's even a prayer room for those who need. Outside, there's patio space too covered with large umbrellas - fantastic in the summer.   SERVICE: As mentioned by others, it can be sort of confusing on your first visit. I think they've improved a little bit with some signage, but sometimes, you can be left at the door scratching your head. But once you order, and grab a seat, a server will soon swoop to your table with super fresh pita/naan as you wait for your order to arrive.   Due to the super casual atmosphere, sometimes you may have to work a bit harder to flag down a server. So feel free to be slightly more aggressive, if you need more water, or pita/naan, etc.  PRICE: Very reasonable. Comparable with other restaurants in the area. But with the large portions here, I feel like you're getting a lot for what you're paying. Great when you're ordering several items to share in a group. This is one reason I keep coming back.  FOOD: Very fresh and flavourful. Love their humus and salads. Humus paired with their oven-fresh pitas (don't get scalded by the steam!) is so good. Sometimes, that's all you need!   Manakeesh are good - I'd recommend trying some traditional stronger flavours (zatar and cheese, for example) and some less intense flavours (spinach and cheese) to get a sample of the range of flavours. Shwaramas are great, and filling for individuals. For large parties, their grilled meats are great. I love to order the mixed grilled plate to share - so you can have a bit of each type of meat. You have a choice of rice or fries for the side.  To wash it all down, try some of their homemade fruit beverages. I LOVE their mango lassi. Very rich and thick. They do offer a range of bottled juices too. So lots of variety.  Don't forget their incredible selection of desserts, or get some baklava to go!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. All locations rock! The quality is the best. I always have an excellent experience here. I wish they would open one in the Durham region. Check out their automatic shawarma trimming machine!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorite team gathering place. It is significantly better than Nirvana which I gave a poor review on due to the piss poor experience I had there. Tonight I am going solo with a light dinner.   The service and the quality of food is above par for the area I am in. I haven't paid for the food here before so I am not sure how well it is price wise until tonight.   The greeter service was quick and efficient. And made my entry experience pretty exceptional.   The only reason I would give this place four star was because of their reservation logistics. Our party had to wait a while for the table when we arrived for my last team gathering. That ding on the experience needs to be recorded. Hopefully my next review won't have that.  Seating here is pretty comfortable even when fully loaded.  You won't feel cramped unless you are morbidly obese. But borderline on the obese BMI scale should be okay.   One other thing to note is this is probably the only ethnic restaurant short of McD that sports a diverse staff in the area. Not just racial but gender as well.   So I finished wolfing down my main dish which is the butter chicken pizza. It's quite good. I would even say better than India Sweets good. There isn't much heat spice so I can tolerate it very well. For $6.99 along with a side of naan i would say I am done. I had a mango strawberry cocktail as well. I made a mistake and I thought that was the paramount special. Good thing too. If I had the paramount special I don't think I would move around anymore. The butter chicken pizza is satisfying already for one person who is not a binge eater.   The one other thing i wished they had because it is such a large area is a button to call the server. Since it's difficult to scan all the tables in such a large area.   I ordered the paramount special and baklava to go for my wife. Hope she likes it. Since this may be the last time I will visit this place for a while as my contract at Mississauga is coming to a close."}
{"text":"Little expensive.  But good food. Great for dinner date.  Nice and spacious place. Nothing negative other than its price   Maybe i wont visit again if i just want my hummus and skewer craving. Other cheap places to go to"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different locations and this one is my favourite. The food is fresh, the portions the right size, and the service is friendly and helpful. This is a great place for almost fast food."}
{"text":"Got a shish tawook wrap. The chicken was pretty tender but my goodness, if that wasn't the smallest wrap I've ever had. The hot sauce is also very very salty. Decent flavours but for $8 a wrap, the portions are ridiculous. Better off going to Shish Kabab Grill on Dundas."}
{"text":"My husband and I are HUGE fans of Paramount.   He had been to other locations before, but when this one opened near our home we definitely had to try it out.  We've now been there about half a dozen times and it's great.    With a 15 month old that is VERY busy, there are many things I appreciate about this restaurant.   We have never had to wait more than 10 mins for a table (on a Saturday at 1 so we expected longer), it is definitely family friendly and in fact family oriented I would say, the food is served very quickly which I appreciate when dining out with a toddler, and the kids' play gym is awesome.  We have a great routine of settling in at the table, going to play while the food is being ordered/prepared, and then going straight from playing to washing hands and eating!    The manager Hasan is always very friendly and comes by to see if we need anything.   Pros: short wait times, family friendly, great portion size for prices, fresh food (mmmm....pitas)  Cons: it can be a \"challenge\" to get glasses of water to your table (drink delivery in general tends to be a bit hit and miss), the music can be a little loud at times if you are looking to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken shwarma and it was very small- finished it in 3 bites. Taste is a bland. Would much rather go to Soulvaki hut and get the same thing, same price, bigger portion and ten times better.  Service was okay. When I was at the Take-Out counter, the workers  (who were right beside me) ignored me and no one acknowledged me. Took about 5 minutes until I asked one of them if I could have my order and they gave it to me..."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. Let me start by saying our server Al was amazing. Knowledgable of the menu and very very professional. He was great to deal with.   The atmosphere was also really good. We were seated upstairs and it was relatively quiet. They had Arabic music playing (maybe it was Lebanese, not sure) which added to the atmosphere.   The food came really quick. Within 3 minutes of ordering our apps, they were on our table. And they tasted amazing. (Grape leaves and chicken shawarma French fries). They also brought out fresh pita bread from the oven for free.   The main course, also a knock out. So fresh and tasty. Great serving size, well worth the price!   Will be returning. Would definitely recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch from the Liberty Village Paramount Fine Foods on several occasions. Each time delicious. Today, I got to try their huge 'burbs location.   I was in Etobicoke for IKEA, naturally, and afterwards me and my date needed a lunch. It's January, so we're eating healthy. Also, naturally.   I had their mixed shawarma plate, extra sauces and it was very satisfying. A little on the expensive side for fast-ish food, but it's a lot nicer than the options around."}
{"text":"I have been to several Paramount locations as the food it always great. This location was no exception but it was the service that was lacking.  Two of us attended on Saturday, March 31st.  There weren't that many patrons dining in likely due to it being the Easter long weekend.  The appetizer (hummus) arrived quickly enough but we waited almost 45 minutes for our entrees and we finally had to ask how much longer we could expect to wait. The manager drifted by and apologized and gave the explanation of a \"large order\" being ahead of us.  This appeared to have been picked up by Uber eats.  It was our opinion, that on this day at least, this location was giving priority to take out orders rather than dine in customers.  We won't return. There are many other options in the Yonge and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"The Kafta kabobs are the best I've had in Toronto. The humus was amazing as well!! Did not enjoy the shish tawouk that much, was dry but honestly the restaurant is all about the kabobs. It's fantastic. The bread we got was a little burnt but overall, the food was great!  The inside is quite amazing, very clean and super modern.   Definitely recommend this place to take out guests."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the butter chicken pizza for lunch today.  First time trying it.  Lots of flavour but not too spicy.  With a group of coworkers the service was fairly quick and efficient.  We all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Gave it a second chance.  1st visit at lunch they served me two undercooked chicken thighs. Clearly pink in the middle despite the meal taking over 25 minutes after ordering in a mostly empty restaurant. The server took a bad situation and made it worse by taking forever to rectify.  2nd visit at lunch they served me undercooked beef kofta and there were three big chunks of bone in what I did eat of it before realizing the middle was still raw. I'm not sure how they even tried to cook it because there were barely any grill marks. Microwaved then grilled seems likely, yet still undercooked!? Again, the sever left me sitting there for 15 minutes waiting to hear back about the undercooked kofta that she returned to the kitchen....!?  Not sure if there will be a third visit. I really like middle eastern food, and wish this place was better. Undercooked meals and untrained service staff are a bad combo!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best middle Eastern places in town Serious commitment to quality and service Tabbouli salad was tasty and fresh BBQ tender, large portion and very reasonable"}
{"text":"Great fresh food and amazing variety!  It's an odd set up as you wait to be seated but then order food at cashier.  Recommend the babaganoush as it's the BEST one I've had at any restaurant.  It comes with warm pita too!  Their meat platters are amazing! Chicken is fresh and tender as well as this beef is delicious.  They have these middle eastern pizzas and my favourite is the cheese one...out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Manakeesh pizza was decent but then I noticed the cashier/cook biting her nails and wiping her dripping nose with her hand.   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I live in the U.S. and have been eating at this Paramount over the years during my visits to Toronto. When I first started coming here the atmosphere was very good - almost like a family run restaurant that paid close attention to detail on the food and customer experience. Over the years however, the experience has been steadily eroding to where the business seems increasingly corporate and less authentic. The food is decent, but has also seems to have gone from home cooking to corporate fast food.   Today, during my current visit to Toronto, a friend and I went into this location and had to wait a couple of minutes before anyone even noticed we were standing at the entrance waiting to be seated.   To the owner of the restaurant - I've noticed Paramount is now a rapidly expanding franchise   in Canada and part of the U.S. Please try to remember to focus on attention to detail as things are clearly not at the level of quality that they once were."}
{"text":"Excellent food, uncivilized environment.  Huge portions, very decent quality and huge diversity of food - as I was told by locals, one of the most authentic in Toronto.  Yet, I've noticed a number of times that male waiters ignore or bully female customers. It looks rude and completely disgusting.  Besides, sitting right in the centre of the city, Paramount is inevitably crowded. I won't mind visiting it again for the food, but I feel deeply incompatible with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried the beef shawarma wrap. The radishes they use made the wrap extremely salty - ended up having to take most of them out. The meat itself had a lot of salt as well. Didn't taste as good as the ones I've tried in the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite new place for Middle Eastern Food! It was a weird concept to order and pay first then have them bring the food over for me. We ordered a mixed grill with a side order of lamb skewer, two paramount specials, and hummus. Before we even got back to our seats there was hummus and pita bread magically awaiting for us.  The hummus was super tasty and one of the best I've had. Pita bread was nice and warm (also they keep giving it to you with no extra charge). The mixed grill platter came with \"one skewer of BBQ beef, shish tawouk & two skewers of kafta grilled on a charcoal barbeque. Garnished with grilled tomato & onion, a piece of spicy bread served with a side dip of garlic sauce & hummus.\" Um, one thing, the garlic sauce is like addictive. SO TASTY. Add in a lamb skewer and  this all filled up me and my friend's stomachs.  The paramount specials were awesome too! The official description is \"mixed fruits merged between layers of fresh strawberry & mango juices topped with fresh strawberry, kiwi, pineapple, almonds, ground pistachio, ashta cream & honey\". Doesn't that sound delicious?? It definitely was and I had this like a dessert to end my delicious dinner.  The servers were always rushing around to make sure that we had everything we needed. I observed when a family left a server right away got the table cleaned up for the next person. Such good service.  I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and portion sizes are huge! I got the chicken and beef plate which comes with a side of salad and rice/fries. It was pretty great with the exception of the beef which I found to be quite salty. I also wish the restaurant itself wasn't so cramped. I was inadvertently overhearing many a conversation going on around me but overall, great food and great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Mediterranean restaurant. The servers are friendly and nice, and the food is amazing. I love the puffy bread they give you in the beginning and I recommend the meat platters."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my Fiancée. It was terrible. The food tasted good but the service and portions were way off. They had to replace both our orders and the portions were small and the vegetables were super skimpy for shawarmas. All in all super dissapointing first and last impression. The server tried to tell is that we ordered wrong and that she personally saw the cook put the vegetables that were clearly not in the wraps. Definitely wouldn't go back.  Maybe other locations are better but this was terrible value. Could have had pitaland for half the price and bigger portions."}
{"text":"Good food. We ordered the family platter and it was good for two couples. I don't think it would have served 5-6 people though as per the menu. The food quality was good though.  The service wasn't bad either. Polite and courteous servers. Service was quick too. Food came out fast.  The kids play area is a plus.  Will go there again"}
{"text":"After a day of shopping and running around the Eaton Centre we were in need of some refueling. We just happened to exit the mall through the yonge street exit and lo and behold there was Paramount waiting for us.  We came in around 730pm on a Saturday evening and the place was packed. We were lucky enough to grab two seats at the \"bar\" or beverage counter? (they don't serve liquor here FYI - it's a halal joint). I really enjoyed sitting up here because you could see all the kitchen and behind the counter action.  After browsing through the menu and watching the cooks shave succulent morsels of meat off the huge spinning meat rotisseries I knew I desperately wanted the Sharwarma. I asked the waitress which was better the beef or chicken. She said both are really good it's hard to pick but she recommended we go with the mixed plate so we could have the best of both worlds.  Chicken & Beef Shawarma A mix of chicken & beef shawarma with a side dip of garlic & tahini sauce.  First of all it was a huge platter of food. Accompanying the shaved meat was a hearty portion of fragrant white rice, pita,  shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and mixed pickles. I absolutely loved the garlic dip, very pungent but ooh so tasty! I also asked for some hot sauce and the waitress brought over a marinara based hot sauce, it wasn't super hot but still very flavorful. Try it! The meat was the real highlight of the meal though, on it's own very flavourful but throw on those sauces and the flavour gets amplified.  Overall not a bad spot for a quick and hearty affordable meal. I actually couldn't believe how fast our food came, the place was super busy and packed but we seated right away and food was delivered within 10-15 minutes.  FYI If your going in the winter months it's best not to sit near the front as the cold breeze from the door opening and closing can be uncomfortable for some and also cool down your food."}
{"text":"I was in the area with a friend of mine and she suggested Paramount for our lunch break. I was confused when she turned into this industrial-looking area, but when we stepped in, it was pretty nice! There are lots of tables so no worries about not getting a seat I think.   We ordered two pizzas - the kishek and the spinach & cheese. For $2.50 and $3 each, it's a pretty good deal. You can see them being made behind the glass window at the counter. We also got a tub of hummus for $5 and it came with two gigantic pieces of pita. They were all hot and puffy from being just made. The tub of hummus looked small, but it was actually a pretty good serving size. Between the two of us, we still had some leftover and so we packed it.  Total damage for two : $14 Service was friendly at the counters and the bussers were really efficient about clearing tables when people left.  On our way out, we got tempted by the cute mini baklava's and ordered some to go. Super sweet, as expected, but small enough to not feel bad for eating it :D"}
