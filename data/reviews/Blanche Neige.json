{"text":"A good quality breakfast at an amazingly low price. When I wasn't working days, I went there nearly every day. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best breakfast for a looney!

So much better than an overpriced brunch ! (Like legit 10x more expensive) 

The portion in my opinion is decent (like something you would pay 5$) but still happy with it ! 

Or theres a bigger brunch set that is 4$ (i think they add 2 more pancakes).

I went there 3 times and never got disappointed because nothing changed !"}
{"text":"People who lives in CDN must know that place.

I went a few times with my husband and he always happy because it's cheap.

He once said to our waitress when he received the bill: 'That's it?' 

The food is not extravagant but tasty and the breakfast is only 2.00$. 
How you can beat that?"}
{"text":"Blanche Neige in Cote Des Neiges does not respect special food requirements. We very clearly stated we wanted a pizza without cheese and they gave us one with cheese. Upon arriving home we noticed this and called them and the server tried to blame us for her error. 
\"I didn't hear\"
When in fact, as someone who is VERY well versed in stating this specification I ALWAYS repeat it at least twice.... and this particular server looked me right in the eye when I said it and nodded.
So I tell her \"I get that you didn't hear it but that's not my problem....\"
She tells us to bring the pizza back in the morning.
Like wtf. Are you going to serve that to someone else? 
Another case of a late night establishment that assumes their patrons are drunk so they can get away with whatever the fuck they want"}
{"text":"Déjeuner complet 1.99$. Attention: le café coûte 1$ et les remplissages coûtent 1$ chaque fois. Bon et pas cher!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the place got worse over the years. The plates and the cutlery have stains on them, the ketchup tastes weird, and even the water sometimes has little bits floating in it.

On the bright side, they offer very big portions of food for reasonable prices. The breakfast is the best deal, a huge plate for only 2$ + tax (although it used to be 1$). They also offer an series of poutines which all taste great and really fill you up, however they make take over 30 minutes to arrive sometimes, which can be a letdown."}
{"text":"The end of the month is approaching. You're checking balance is dwindling. But it's been a rough few days, and you deserve to sit down and have some decent food with some smiling service. With that in mind, I ventured into good ol' Blanche Neige for the first time. My homies typically come here drunk at 2am, so I was breaking tradition, but hey, hunger is hunger. 

I strolled in around 1pm, and it looked like either I missed the lunch rush or this just isn't the lunch spot for the CDN work crowd. Kinda hard for a little greasy spoon to compete with some of the places around here I imagine. But whatever. 

The server was sweet, the pork chop dish I got was around 10 bucks, and it was solid. Nothing to call home about, but it did the job. Seasoned nicely and grilled, with some surprisingly good french fries and rice, and a salad. I could've done without the alphabet soup. But again, it did the job. 

Next time I'm coming here for the $2 breakfast or the 2am hangover cushion."}
{"text":"Food is great and inexpensive. The highlight is obviously the 2$ breakfast which is a pretty good amount. However, there are other strong points for this restaurant. The roast chicken is very tasty and is barely 10$, huge portion. The fries in my opinion are great, must try the poutine once. Overall i'd say you cant find this quality of food for the same price."}
{"text":"Blanche neige is knowned for their 2$ breakfast! Yes 2$...2 eggs, choice of meat (sausage is the best), potatoes, toast and coffee! You can also get the large breakfast for 4$ and you get two extra pancakes. Breakfast is served daily from 6am-11am (Monday through Friday). Weekends are until 2pm! 

This place serves about everything..pizza, greek, chinese...anyways the pizza is not that bad but please avoid the chinese. The food is not bad but I wouldn't go and eat there unless I'm around the area or really hungry at night.

I like the fact that they offer late night delivery until 2am. It is also opened 24h on the weekends so it could be a good place after a long night. 

Service is really a hit or miss! Not a bad place, they redecorated the place and It's not bad!"}
{"text":"Where else can you sit in a fairly clean diner and eat a full breakfast for $1.99?"}
{"text":"Oeufs pourris, mayonnaise douteuse. Bon service, mais à éviter absolument. Les prix peuvent parfois vous attirer à certains endroits, mais parfois il va mieux payer un peu plus pour ne pas terminer à l'hôpital. Le bacon était correct."}
{"text":"Ahh! Blanche Neige, to be advised a fairy tale only measurably. The menu is inclusive and most connotative of a common diner. Its bill of fare covers from a conservative pasta dishes (i.e. spaghetti with meat sauce) to a similar in style, pizzas (i.e. deluxe and pepperoni). 

Blanche Neige does not in any ways embodies arrogant pretexts. I had the spaghetti special for 4.99$ that includes the soup of the day. The pastas were al dente and sufficient tomato sauce with a generous meat ratio. The soup was eloquently salted though. The restaurant is mainly populated with regular older folks. And sometime, a younger crowd on a budget."}
{"text":"Vraiment incroyable car on peut avoir un dejeuner complet pour 2$! 
Cependant  le service est proportionnel au prix du repas.."}
{"text":"Breakfast for 2$, eggs, bacon or sausage, fried potato wedges and toast + coffee or tea. I've been there a few times but won't go there after I've seen cockroaches crawling on the floor near the kitchen which by the way reeks  of cigarette smoke.
I don't know what they're serving for 2 bucks or how they can afford it but I have a pretty bad feeling about the place."}
{"text":"Blanche Neiges is a hit or a miss. Avoid things that couldn't possibly be good in a diner... A $12 filet mignon, diner Chinese food, overly complicated salads are all things to avoid. 

Poutine snobs should be aware that the poutine is made with mozzarella, not curds!

Their fries, chicken and veggie slouvaki, and sandwiches are done perfectly. They have ridiculously cheap specials like all inclusive early bird meals for 5.99 or a huge $2 breakfast. 

More importantly, they're open long after the bars close and they deliver beer as well as wine!

A neighborhood gem'"}
{"text":"If you're into budgeting, blanche neige is a well kept secret. While it doesn't hide any culinary delights, it is cheap and decent food. The dinners are massive, and if you get the special, highly affordable. It's alright stuff.

But the restaurant shines with its brunch special. I'm not sure how they afford it, but you get ham or bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast and coffee or tea for TWO DOLLARS. It is sick - it isn't the best brunch in the world but for two dollars it outdoes itself in value. I was too lazy to get up early enough to get there on week days before class, but the brunch runs until eleven. On weekends brunch runs until 2 pm, and it must be a neighborhood secret because it is always packed. There will be a line.

You definitely get what you pay for. Blanche Neige is the sketchy restaurant you pass by a few times. You might look at it and scoff. The inside comes unironically straight out of the seventies and you will have paper place mats. The service is alright in both french and english, but if you complain about brunch they'll tell you to suck it up or get out. But for two dollars, why complain? This place has character baby, and I definitely miss it."}
{"text":"Its no secret that Im as cheap as it gets and any place that serves up a delicious hot breakfast for $2, is more than alright by me.

Seriously, nothing gets me fired up quite like a sweat deal - and good luck trying to find a better deal than this.

We're talking eggs, your choice of breakfast meats (i personally prefer the sausage), home fries, toast and coffee.  $2 bucks - straight up.  

I mean - seriously...  $2 bucks!

You cant even buy a back alley BJ for that price anymore.  And I promise you that if you can, it wont be nearly as satisfying as this breakfast.

{"text":"Look around the street; Blanche Neige was here many years before the current crop of restaurants and it will be here many years after they leave. It's a staple for doctors working late nights and the casually hungover. A practical icon of CDN at this point, I believe they've been here since at least the 60s. I've worked at many restaurants in the area and we've noticed that their dogged persistence at keeping prices relatively low has allowed them to thrive where others have closed shop.

Be warned, the food at best is better-than-mediocre, and the service is hit-or-miss. The food is pretty much a recreation of items from other local American/Italian/Greek/Quebec restaurants, but with lower quality ingredients (or their substitutes). The portions are fairly large. Some of the waitresses have this attitude, kind of a \"the breakfast is 2$, what do you expect\" attitude. Don't expect minor substitutions to be granted and asking them for poached eggs is something that's not within your prerogative. The owner's wife works there sometimes and is pretty nice however.

The breakfast (which in theory is 2$, but in practice usually at least 5$) is cheap and filling. Considering how breakfast is overpriced at many places, I couldn't fathom buying breakfast elsewhere in the vicinity on an informal occasion.

I was torn between giving them a 3 or a 4-star rating and would realistically give them something in between both. If I could sum this place up in one expression, it would be that this place is really a you-get-what-you-pay-for establishment. Usually, I don't go back to 3 star places. I'll definitely be going back, but mainly when my wallet is feeling light or when I'm out late at night. Or maybe just for the nostalgia."}
{"text":"Just had the $2 breakfast, nothing wrong with that! basic, simple, but not too bad. Coffee is a bit weak, but doable, extra cup is .75. Left $4 and on my way. A bit slow service when they are full, only 2 wait staff, but just sit back and relax. Very much a diner feel.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall great place.  I went there a lot with my friends at late night or afternoon. Their surlonge steak is great.  I like a lot. Except the portion is not enough for big guy, but the price is amazing. So it's a good place to order multiple foods at same to have a try."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars here. This location is definitely a solid spot for a good meal. Don't expect American portions but expect an affordable plate. Past reviews boast of a 1.99 breakfast, my guess is that this is something that you must ask for because we didn't see it on our menu. Actually the waitress asked us for our order before we even saw the menu. The yelp site states that this vendor accepts all major credit cards; this is not the case, please bring cash."}
{"text":"Great food, right size portion, and good service. I tried the chicken souvlaki plate with Greek salad. Quite the standard kind of souvlaki you can find anywhere else. Customer service is superb, but they only take cash!"}
