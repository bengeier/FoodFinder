{"text":"Went to this restaurent with high expectations due to the great reviews but was left quite disappointed. The fish portion was really small and my vegetarian tofu bowl was overly salty."}
{"text":"As usual following yelp' advise for new places was the right one. After a long day of sightseeing and shopping we stepped into this place to discover the yummilitious rice bowls with raw fish, tuna ir saulmon ."}
{"text":"Hawaiian style poke. Personally prefer this style over the Japanese style. It's mixed with more soy than mayo. Portion size was good. Place was not busy in the middle of the afternoon and food was ready in a few minutes. Ordered the Black Magic- mainly consist of marinated salmon with furikake seasoning, some peppers and crisp bits for some crunch. It's quick, it's filling and a great choice for lunch. Not heavy or oily"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, and very overpriced. I paid 39$ for two bowls including tip. Left a 5$ tip (15%), but I'm not sure what it was for - I still had to pickup my food like at McDonalds next door. I really regret eating here."}
{"text":"The food and the quality of the fish is excellent. Unlike other poke places, you can't create your own poke but the twist of flavours offered on the menu is much better in my opinion. Good quantity of fish for the price you pay. The decor is beautiful, digging the Hawaiian vibes. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Good vibes great decors. I had the mama California and it was good not too spicy. Wish there was more flavour to it though."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I paid $13 for a tiny salad with a bunch of leaves and very little flavour. I was expecting something similar to the poke place on crescent and was thoroughly disappointed. The avocado was terrible, the flavours didn't go well together at all. The wakame didn't taste good. It was probably the most worthless meals I've ever had. Don't go here. If you want poke, go to the one on crescent at least - they let you choose what you want to put and they mix it really well with the sauce so the flavours really blend."}
{"text":"La place est trop cool le decor vraiment chouette et relax. La salade super bonne!! Le personnel sympa. Vraiment un endroit a faire si vous etes dans le coin."}
{"text":"Decor is amazing. I really like how they decorated the place. The food is always fresh quickly served and tasteful. Great place."}
{"text":"This is a really great poke place! The fish + other ingredients are really fresh. Staff was super nice and played good music. It's a great place to eat with others, study (free WiFi), or just to chill and eat Poke. I really loved the environment and the music they played. There's a wide variety of poke bowls. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok pour un resto pour le lunch mais les 2 voisins sont meilleurs pour des prix comparables. Les saveurs sont bonnes mais il manquait de légumes dans les bols et il y avait un peu trop de riz. J'ai bien aimé leur jus. Bref, a essayer une fois puisqu'il s'agit d'un met différents des autres restos downtown pour environ 15-20$ par personne. Joli décor comme Le Escondite et Le Habanera."}
{"text":"I'm a huge #anythingwithrawfish aficionado....and well yes, a huge poke fan... yeah I know I'm not so original because it is now sooo trendy, but the good side of it, is that I've been able to try a few different ones and I'm starting to be very good at differentiating the very good from the very bad. This being said, I was in the mood for something different and I wanted to try this place for a very long time, I never had the opportunity to try the one on Union Street but was very close to that location so I've decided to try this one instead. 

All I can say is Wow! They did an A-MA-ZING job with the decor! Within a few seconds, I left the \"covered with snow\" Ste-Catherine Street and landed somewhere peaceful and relaxing in Hawaii...Such a great feeling! I was expecting a tiny location, but there's plenty of room so you can go and hang out with your group of friends.  I had the \"Black Magic\" which is made of salmon, white rice, jalapeno and a crunch mix: The salmon was on point, well marinated, very spicy... I loved it! The rice was well cooked and the crunchy part was very interesting. I wanted to try their Aloha Ice Tea, but unfortunately, they were out of stock. The price was affordable compared to other Poke places ($13). 

The service was very quick and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be going back to try other items from their menu and get my little dose of sunshine during winter."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick exotic meal - poké bowls with different fish/vegetables toppings and the price is reasonable ($13 - 14 per bowl w/t tax). I ordered a Black Magic, with the top of plenty of seasoned salmon and jalapeño, and the base of steamed white rice. It was served in a paper bowl, and the size was bigger than I have expected. When I finished the bowl I felt just right. The taste was great. Try scooping a spoonful of fish and rice, and enjoy the mix! Yum!! Plus, must try the drink Niu Wai, which has a strong taste of coconut and a creamy texture, delivering a feeling of summertime. 

I will definitely come back again and try other bowls."}
{"text":"Came here tonight around 8:30 to grab some dinner to go. As people were leaving, I looked inside and the person was already closing up. The guy said they were closed. Everything wa packed away. WTF? It's 8:30 and the signs say they close at 9:00. Maybe I'll try again another time.

Update:
Finally got to eat here and it was average. It's more fusion hawaiian and the flavors are too rich for my taste. Fish could be fresher, rice to fish ratio is high. However the spam musubi was good but it's hard to mess that up."}
{"text":"I went for poke again and I was really disappointed. There was only 4 pieces of salmon in my Tonga Tonga. The salmon also had a weird taste to it. I tried calling 5 time to maybe get some insight on why I only had 4 pieces of salmon, no one answered. I believe it's a hit or miss. Still love the deco but this recent experience left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite restaurant last year. Recently when I went the portions seemed smaller than usual while the prices were increased despite already being fairly high. They also got rid of all their eco friendly bowls and utensils. I don't understand why they can't use ceramic bowls instead of disposal plastic ones. Great atmosphere but let's down on portion size, price, and values of the company."}
{"text":"The serving is 2/5
The taste 1,5/5
The decor: instagrammable 
Overall: never coming back"}
{"text":"The place is super well decor and vibrant.  You order at the cash and you get called when the food is ready. I had the black magic dish which is spicy (but I believe they can accommodate you if you don't like spicy food). Service was pretty fast and the food was yummy. Great portion for the price. One thing I love about this place is that they have pitchers of water and cups available so you don't have to buy a water bottle.  However if you don't like tap water, there are water bottles as well as coconut water and soda cans."}
{"text":"Not impressed by my experience here, the food quality/quantity/taste is subpar to what you are paying for. 
If the fish is supposed to be the star of the plate, well it was disappointing. I had the Ono bowl and the tuna felt chewy and tasted/smelled fishy. My friend ordered the BlackMagic bowl (with salmon) and seemed satisfied. 
The rice felt like it was cooked a long time ago, and all the grains were densely compacted together (I might be biased, I do have asian cooking standards). To add to that, it had no seasoning, so we had to add more soy sauce and sriracha on our own.
*It could be an interesting feature if they provided furikake (Japanese rice seasoning) on the tables to add to the bland rice.
This is a sit-in fast food restaurant (read: self service) nicely decorated situated in the Concordia ghetto. Come in for lunch if you're not too picky with what you eat and you want a cute Instagramable place to take pictures. 
Personally, I would not return, there are much better places in Montreal to get poke."}
{"text":"Their mama California poke bowl is delicious. 
Slightly spicy with fresh salmon and rice with crunchy bits. Getting the extra avocado makes it perfect for me. 

It's the ideal place if you want to relax and have a cute instagram lunch. 

They have lots of fun juices too. I think it's a bit pricey but most poke places are expensive so it's normal. 

The rest of my review points stay the same."}
{"text":"Omg this place is sooo photogenic! It's super well decorated, cute and so coloful!! 
I went there with a friend from Regina last week and had a great time. It was pretty late already when we made it there, so the place wasn't very busy. We picked a table (the surfboard one), then changed to another one, then another. The whole place looked so cool! 

The menu was well explained, with all the ingredients listed. My friend got the Juicey (salmon, avocado, brown rice, wasabi aioli, teriyaki, cucumber, crunch mix and salad) and I got the Hulk (baby greens, avocado, wakame, edamame, wasabi peas, jalapeno, dry pineapple, shiso, pickled cucumber, mint, cilantro and wasabi dressing). We took a few photos while waiting for the food. It didn't take long before two beautiful bowls of super healthy stuff showed up at the counter for us. Although we didn't ask for take out, the food was served in clear plastic bowls, which I think was an oversight. The servings were decent, but smaller than I thought (I think I expected more because of Le Poké Bar). The first few bites were a bit dry, since there wasn't a lot of sauce and a salad in a small bowl is always kind of hard to mix. Then all the different toppings started showing up. The candied pineapple was a particularly pleasant discovery. Who knew that would be delicious with avocados and wasabi peas?? All these flavors that initially seemed disparate came together in a delicious and interesting way. I liked it a lot.

I find that Koa Lua has much more interesting flavors and combinations than Le Poké Bar. But if you're looking to fill up a very hungry tummy, I'd go to the latter (it's also a tad less expensive). 

Note: they were selling \"butter mochi\" by the counter. Not sure how that would taste like, but sounds great!"}
{"text":"Okay so I really love poke bowls and I go to this place to grab lunch once or twice a week. I usually have the black magic because the salmon is always very fresh, it's full of amazing spices and also has some crunchiness to it!!! It's great for lunch & take out because you get served at the counter within minutes. The place is also well decorated with amazing Hawaiian  vibes"}
{"text":"A smaller location than their 1212 Union Avenue counterpart. 

Their menu is almost the same except they have a poke bowl called \"Jucey\" and it's the best one they offer hands down! It has all my favourites (brown rice, salmon, avocado) and it's 15$.

I really love this franchise. I think they offer really creative food and it's always filling and delicious.  

Get to go and eat in Philipp's square on a nice day!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something quick, tasty, fresh and affordable this is definitely your go-to place! They offer a variety of bowls with an option of swapping the white rice for brown, which personally I prefer. Aside from the delish food, the decor itself is worth the visit. From the moment you walk in you're immediately enthralled by the Hawaiian theme. 

Must haves:
Hapa Bowl
Mama California Bowl"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Koa Lua, not only because I am a huge fan of poke, but also because there are pictures of their food and deco all over instagram. 

First off, the moment you step inside you just feel so refreshing, the summer and hawaiian vibes just hit you (in a good way). The deco is 100% on point

I ordered the california bowl with salmon and a mutsubi.
- California bowl: I was kinda disappointed by the portion of the bowl, because compared to poke bar who really mounts their poke pretty high, koa lua's is on the smaller side. So for the small portion, I felt like it was a bit pricey. BUT, I have to admit, the flavor is bomb: a bit spicy but not too much to the point to cover the flavor of the salmon, the rice crispy cereals add texture to the food. Literally every bite was good and I didnt feel bored by the flavor at all. The presentation is the only thing I feel is a bit lacking...
- Mutsubi: It came wrapped in plastic, so the presentation isn't too great. It was a bit too salty in my opinion. Not woow just a ok kinda thing. 

I will come again for sure. Flavor wise Koa Lua is better than Poke bowl, but portion wise, hands down Poke bowl wins."}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every other week with my friends. The decor is cool, Hawaiian-like. There is a good amount of choice and the poke is quite good. However, their prices were already quite high a while ago ($13 + tax for a Mama California, my personal favorite) and they recently increased them. I just had to pay a total of $17.25 for a Mama California poke bowl and it took me a while to get over it. I've been showing this place off over the past year and will probably stop doing so now that the prices are outrageous. 

To be fair, the food is pretty good, but not worth close to $20 a head for a regular lunch."}
{"text":"First impression was great, they had a fun tropical decor setup, music that vibes with the place, and a hand drawn menu.
The cashier asked if I liked spicy, so I told her no and she recommended a few non spicy items. I chose the tuna bowl, and it turned out spicy. Ofc I told her after and she just said \"ohh your tolerance is really low...next time tell me NO spice!\" -_- my nose was seriously running and tongue burning at that point but ok.
Got the Ono poke bowl, which was tuna based. Super lacking in ingredients, tuna just kind of tossed on with some onion and other small garnish items. Aka no vegetables or their major toppings. 
They also use paper bowls that the rice stick onto, not a great idea.
Also got the spam musubi, which was what I expected in terms of flavour. But $3 is too hefty a price for that.
Almost every poke review I write, I throw in \"bit overpriced\" but this time I mean it. (Bowl and musubi cost me $19) There are definitely better quality ones out there."}
{"text":"Absolument délicieux pour une première expérience de poke! Un peu dispendieux pour la quantité, quoi qu'au centre ville on ne devrait pas s'attendre à autre chose. Seule critique: un peu trop de sauce. Autrement, le poisson est fond dans la bouche, et ils sont généreux au niveau des avocats, ce qui est toujours agréable."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place but not worth the detour either. 
Portions are small and for the price...there are many options in the area. 
Also ate in and food was served in plastic bowl, not super eco for a hawaïen place."}
{"text":"Tried out their salmon poke bowl and the flavors were quite good. However, the portions are fair small for something over $15 after tax and tip. While it is tasty and trendy, I'm not sure if the price point is worth it for me."}
{"text":"Very tasty and enjoyable. Portion does not look that big, but it is and it WILL fill you up. The variety and the pairings with rice make this place super nice. You can`t however, customize your poke bowl as the other place does. The fish is very very fresh and the staff are super friendly. The décor is so cute, nice music, it really feels like you're in Hawaii.  Do try the coconut juice they have, its delish!! 20$ with tip for a poke bowl + juice. I would definetly go back for my poke cravings."}
{"text":"If you crave real Hawaiian poke, I do not recommend this restaurant because the poké served at Koa Lua is inauthentic, the portions of fish are tiny, and the staff is not accommodating. 

I was very excited to learn that a poké joint was opening near my place but I was extremely disappointed all three times I've visited this place. 

The portion of fish is so meager that it was hard to believe! A thin veneer of fish at the top of the bowl, barely enough to sustain even the mildest of appetite. This scantness was unfortunately consistent through all my visits. 

To add fuel to the flames, the staff is unwilling to accommodate even the slightest requests. For example, I requested to have salad instead of rice but was denied. 

Lastly, the authenticity is to be questioned. In Hawaii, where poké originates, the portion of raw fish is generous  and is mixed with different sauces; it is sometimes served with rice and/or some vegetables/salad. At Koa Lua, the poké is a far cry from authentic. One of my orders had rice crispies in it!

However, I do commend Koa Lua for trying something different in Montreal. The ambience is tropical and breezy.

Overall, Koa Lua was a culinary disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favourite poke bowl in the downtown core. Eclectic decor  and original menu. There is also an outdoor eating area too."}
{"text":"The last time I had a bowl of covered salmons that great was in Kyoto. I wasn't too sure what to order and I felt a bit uneasy not seeing the images of what the food looks like. I ordered a mama California and I enjoyed it. 

Lovely place and lovely concept."}
{"text":"It is a change to be traditional lunch option.

It was packed at 12:15 when I arrived to grab lunch and luckily was able to spot a woman leaving. The line up was quite long but moved quickly and the good came very quickly as well.

Although the poke bowl seemed small at first but it will fill out up since most of it is rice.

I had the black magic salmon bowl and my sister got the mama California bowl. There was decent chunks of salmon in each serving and the fish seemed fresh as there was no fishyness. 

Taste wise: although good but nothing out of this world. I feel like I could have assembled this at home. 

We also each took their specialty drink Niu Wai which consists of coconut milk, papaya and other juices mixed together. Tasted ok but $3 for a small cup is on the expensive side.

I would go back there once in a while for a change in lunch option but it won't be a regular spot. Expect to pay $18-$20 before tax if you take a drink with your poke bowl."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!!

Great fresh food on the go. Fun place (a few seats available) to enjoy your meal. 

Cool funky staff.

Bravo Yann Lévy, another success!"}
{"text":"Vraiment coquet comme endroit! 

Les \"pokes\" sont délicieux. Beaucoup aimé le \"Black Magic\" au saumon. 11$ c'est aussi très raisonnable. 

Le jus maison de coconut était très réussi.

Du même proprii que le Escondite, Le Habanera et Biiru, Yann Lévy. Toujours des endroits cools et tendance!"}
{"text":"Came here with my best girlfriend for a little lunch date and couldn't of chosen a better spot! 
Comfy and cozy!

Wonderful portions for the cost. 10-12$ so affordable.
Great flavour, absolutely delicious. 
The fish is exceptionally fresh! 
Loved the homemade hot sauce. EXTRA POINTS. 

Small menu with a variety of choices.

Extra friendly and inviting staff.
Beautiful decor and good music.
 Can't wait to come back and try more. 

Love love LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Terrible for the price. If you've ever had a real poke, you would know this place is bad. Ordered the original Ono...too much chilli flakes. Maybe 8 cubes of tuna, the rest just rice and onion...horrible experience for $16. Don't do it...."}
{"text":"PoKE!!! I've never had Hawaiian food before. I was pleasently surprised!! It looks like sushi in a bowl... and yes!! It tastes like sushi in a bowl. 

If you like sushi; dfinately give this a taste! I also ordered an avocado entre. Its a half avocado with sauce and sour cream on it... with some seeds and seaweed. I scooped it up and added it to my bowl. It was deliscious. 

I would definately recommend and am definately going to be going back!!"}
{"text":"Délicieux le Papa California!! Un repas d'une excellente fraîcheur et goûteux! 
Le personnel est hyper sympathique !!!
La déco est unique!!!
J'y retourne c'est certain pour essayer différents repas!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location only once , but have been to their location on union multiple times. Decor and space wise this location is way bigger and nicer but the food is good at both. Nice big poke bowls they offer the option to do half rice half salad and they give the choice between brown rice or white rice which is good. The decor here makes you feel like you're at beach side restaurant in Hawaii , casual , tropical and bright. lots of indoor seating and some outdoor seating. Service was good I ordered 3 different poke bowls with various substitutions and they didn't miss a beat and I didn't wait very long for the order. The prices are okay , it's not super cheap but won't break the bank either and considering the portions are pretty big and the food is fresh and flavourful it evens out.  I'll likely be back for lunch when I'm craving poke."}
{"text":"If you want a great poke bowl this is the spot to go to ! You get a nice big portion of fresh fish with sticky rice , greens and a variety of toppings depending on the bowl that you choose. The ingredients are always fresh and prepared with care and while the ingredients are simple , the flavour is great. My usual go to is the California bowl with Tuna or the black magic- always half rice half salad. Another thing I really enjoy is that they don't drench the bowl with sauce which allows you to be able to taste the flavours of all the individual ingredients. My coworkers and I eat here regularly and none of us has ever been disappointed. a few quick things to note though , first off while they do have seats to eat there and the decor is nice with a beachy vibe, this is more of a casual lunch or early dinner resto as opposed to a date night or a late night sit down dinner. I highly recommend koa Lua for any poke lover -I've had poke in Hawaii and this place still holds up in comparison !"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mama California (with Black sesame seeds instead of regular sesame seeds) and their guanábana-carambola smoothie, it was pretty good quality-wise and it was fast served. They forgot that I ordered the fruit juice, but I just communicated that and got it in a second! It has also some nice decorations and the staff was just generally very friendly. Salmon was delicious and the spicy mayo was a nice touch (so nice that I had to ask for the squeeze bottle to put some more). I could've used more food on my portion considering the price, but otherwise this place ticks all the boxes for a good day-to-day lunch."}
{"text":"I live nearby (4 minutes walking distance) and saw this new place so I decided to give it a try.

The decor is nice with the blue/turquoise as main color to match their Hawaiian theme. You walk in, you'll forget a fee seconds of winter lol.

It's a fast-food type of restaurant, which means you order at the counter and pick up your food then get a table.

Food:
Menu variety, salmon, tuna, shrimp, tofu and.... Spam are their main choices. 
Not many choices, 8 choices of pokebowl in total, basically it's the same stuff with different combination of sauce and veggies.

Some little snack such as salad, spam sushi, alohavocado (avocado + home made sauce)

Drinks :
Soft drinks, sparkling water or NuWai (coconut drink).

Service:
Well you place your order then pick up your food. Nothing much to expect there.

Overall experience :
Well they are slow for a fast-food type restaurant. I ordered 1 salad, 1 side and 2 main dishes... Waited a good 10/15 minutes, not terrible you say but knowing the rice see pre-cook then they just need to add the salmon/tuna, little veggies and sauce... Then the wait time is a bit not reasonable.

Price are a bit over, you can easily have a way better quality pokebowl for a buck or 2 more in a restaurant... Again they are fast-food.

The spam sushi is awfully over price, $3 a piece for a slice of spam on sushi size rice and some terriyaki sauce... you get the idea.

For me it's convenient since it's nearby my home but wouldn't go there every week because of their lack of choices and a bit over price."}
{"text":"Love this place :) awesome decor , nice customer service and yummy poke bowls ! 
It's just the right amount. I've been here a couple of times and always get the salmon california my all time fave with the crispy tempura and spicy mayo. They have a house made drink I believe made with coconut milk unfortunately I found it too sweet for my taste but it was none the less pretty savoury. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"A nice place for a lunch break of work day. I ordered a Poké Mama California, a Alohaavoca and a Niu Wai. The response time for a order was quite short. The taste was good! The volume was just fine. I also like the colorful decoration inside. It feels fresh and tropical"}
{"text":"This place is great! Buuuut the portions are very small. The fish is fresh and the condiments and sauces otherwise are fantastic."}
{"text":"I would like to state my opinion to their food before they delete this comment.

Good Points
- Interior (exterior) decor and location
- decent service (water, napkins, hot sauce etc)

Bad Points
- Rice literally DIPPED into the soy sauce
- Sticky rice, super old
- Smallest piece of tuna I've ever seen in ahi poke

Notes
- overpriced (considering the cost to ship the tuna, maybe it's ok)
- decently friendly service

Would never go again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so fresh and tasty. It's a great value and so quick. It's very close to my office and I pick up from here often. 

It's a fantastic place. Great for foodies."}
{"text":"Miam miam miam! A taste of Hawaii in Montreal!

I've never tasted Hawaiian food before, no poke bowl, nothing! So there I was! Discovering! No idea what I was going to taste and not knowing what to expect! So me and my girlfriend chose the Traditional Ono and the Mama California with a Maui drink. Sometimes you crave fresh fish and you'll end up thinking about sushis. Now you have another option! Koa Lua! Fair portions and tasty bowls! Though I must warn you, some bowls are spicier than others, so if your girlfriend happens to choose one of the spicier one, prepare to drink water (which you have to get yourself)! The drink is a bit expensive to my taste though... but still tasted fresh and was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch within a week. First, I tried the 'Papa California' poke, which is said to be the spiciest option on the menu. On the second time, I tried the 'Black Magic Ninja' poke, which is described as sweet and spicy.

Between the two, Black Magic poke is a dollar or two cheaper, but I found 'Papa California' to be more substantial: the bowl contained more carbs, and the flavours were more accentuated in comparison to the bland Ninja sauce in the 'Black Magic' poke.

I rate 4/5 for \"Papa California\". Its sometimes overwhelming hot sauce (although not very hot, but enough to overwhelm raw fish), good variety of texture (crispy and chewy elements), and good balance of protein and carbs make this bowl of poke pretty enjoyable. 

As for the 'Black Magic', I find the bowl not filling and bland. The contrast in texture is there, but everything else was not memorable. Even the 'secret' Ninja sauce felt like something anyone could have made at home: soy sauce, a little vinegar, a little sweetness, and a little spiciness. In fact, this whole bowl could have been easily whipped out. I think it's worth a 3/5 at best.

Now Hawaiian food is rather rare in Montreal, so this is a pretty good place to get a feel of what it's like, although I must comment that it seems like Hawaiian fusion with all the unusual ingredients."}
{"text":"Concept santé , ingredients frais, belle deco, bon service , pas bon marche mais on mange le necessairement bon."}
