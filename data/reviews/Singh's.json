{"text":"Went with friends to check this place out a couple of weeks ago. We had the all-you-can-eat table d'hote option for $22 and let me tell you, it was soooooo good! Saved us from having to make tough choices between all the delicious-sounding menu options 'cause they just brought us a fabulous variety of dishes. The food just kept coming, until I was stuffed to the gills. Bring your own wine, so the meal is actually very reasonably priced, all told. The server was hilarious, kept joking with our group. Great ambience, too. I would stack this up against anything I ate while travelling in India and say that it's at least as good if not better. I hope they're around for a long time 'cause I can see this place becoming one of my favourite spots."}
{"text":"Les mets indiens dans ce Resto sont vraiment bons et le service aussi. J'adore le poulet Korma mais laissez vous tenter par d'autres mets qui sont tout aussi bons. Apportez votre vin :))"}
{"text":"Singh's is King! Simply the best South Asian food I've had since living in India. Fresh, vibrant, perfectly spiced food. Try the green tikka and the Rogan josh (ask for medium high spice) with perfect naan. Great service too & BYOB policy."}
{"text":"Resto indien sympa, abordable et apportez votre vin. Excellent service! Le thali est une bonne option à peu de frais (environ 12$)."}
{"text":"It's so disappointing when Yelpers lead you wrong, but this ended up being one of those places. It was our first night in Montreal and we wanted to get some takeout since we'd been driving all day and were led astray by Yelp saying Curry Majal was open until 10:30 (it's not open at all on Tuesday, the night we came in, and only open til 10 week nights). This place was close and well-reviewed so we came here instead. The hostess was fine and took our order, but asked us to pay before getting groceries across the street. So we wait for the man ringing up another tab and then he disappears into the kitchen. He finally comes back and tells us to sit down. We say we just want to pay as instructed so we can pick up some groceries and he tells us to pay when we get the food. A waste of five minutes but we were accommodating and came back 15 minutes later. The man made us tell him everything we ordered again since he hadn't bothered to get the check from the hostess, then turns to me, looks me up and down and says \"you don't look like you're from here, where are you from?\" As an ethnically ambiguous brown woman I'm used to this bs from white dudes but it's worse from brown ones - you should know how crappy it feels to be singled out and have others think they're entitled to a reading of your family tree while you're just trying get some damn dinner, so don't do it to others. I simply said \"New York,\" which clearly didn't satisfy his curiosity as he frowned giving my white husband the check. To top it off, they forgot our samosas and were completely unapologetic when we had to walk back to wait for them to make them, and the bizarre man took the paper bag they were in and told my husband they were \"very hot\" and tried to touch the greasy hot bag to my husband's skin to prove it. WTF? Our butter chicken thali was incredibly small for $12 and had been packaged so poorly that most of the sauce spilled out into the bag. The samosas and lamb saag were decent, but given the poor service I would advise others to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Montreal  food was awesome and the people running it even more good. Maza aagaya yaha kaake"}
{"text":"Excellent, pas trop cher. Tout était bon, belle ambiance le soir. Bons pains naan. J'ai eu une préférence pour le palak paneer. Il aurait pu y avoir plus de poulet dans le poulet au beurre. Le lassi à la mangue est délicieux! C'est un apportez votre vin aussi."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on a Sunday night around 6:30pm. The food arrived at our door around 7:45pm and we noticed there was no rice in the bag (we ordered rice with our order). We called back to get our rice. The driver and the small amount of rice arrived at 8:45pm.   Food was just okay. Staff was mostly unapologetic about not delivering our rice the first time and for being so late."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and good, chilly chicken, samosa chaat and baigan barta were yummy.  Reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"A great find. Their lunch special is ridiculously good for the price. 3 Veggie thali for 6.49? Very hearty and deliciously spiced, and very good nan included. I also ordered the veggie pakoras that were crisp on the outside, fluffy goodness on the inside, served with three sauces. What a gem of a place. I had the butter chicken lunch 2 days ago, which was served with a juicy and crisp tandori chicken AS WELL, AND a veg dish, salad, rice, nan .... for $8.99. So yes, I went back today. And I'm so happy after the veggie meal I took a delivery menu home. The \"non-lunch special\" dishes are not expensive either. Maybe this weekend!"}
{"text":"Good choice! Simple but nice decor. Good selection with economical options. We went for thalis which were very good."}
{"text":"The food and service is outstanding.  Very friendly staff and high value for money.  Excellent as always"}
{"text":"Incredible Food. Wonderful Service. BYOW.  Simply put, this is the best Indian restaurant I've found in Montreal. Everything I've tried on the menu has been exquisite.  The Fish Pakora is a great starter. Light so it doesn't ruin your main course, but a delectably subtle heat.  The Palak Paneer is the freshest I've ever had. And the flavour! It was like a Bollywood wedding recital in my mouth.  And they have Dosas! Delicious, mouth watering Dosas that wrap you in their warmth and make you forget all your troubles. You should eat these Dosas.  And the Service! Never, in my entire life, have I had such warm, personable service. Every member of the staff is nothing short of charming and endearing.  So if you enjoy Indian cuisine, you should try Singh's at the very next opportunity. In fact, you should stop what you're doing (reading this), and consider when that very next opportunity might be, and just get'er done. Because until you do, you're missing out on one of the best things this city has to offer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but understaffed and our table had to constantly look for them and wait long periods.  A waitress grabbed our dipping sauces from our table to put it in front of two other clients without having replaced the sauces and cleaning the dish they were served it. This left us questioning the sanitary etiquette and what else goes on in the kitchen. Bathrooms dirty and dated.  It looks like they cut corners to save $.  Food was delicious but I will not go back because of serious concern regarding sanitary etiquette."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the staff was absolutely wonderful!! The dishes that were down right amazing was the mutton biryani and the butter chicken. The service was exceptional... Thank u Karishma!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone who feels like having some Indian comfort food!!"}
{"text":"This was the only Indian restaurant we tried in Montreal but I can tell you I'm sure it's one of the best! I'm Indian so I think I can tell :)  The service was really great, they asked how the food was but didn't bother incessantly. The ambience was cozy and authentic, with interesting pieces of art that weren't too garish.  Now the food, it was absolutely delicious. We went for the onion bhajia, the palak paneer, vegetable biryani, and two naan. The onion bhajia were warm, and could've been a bit more crunchy but they were absolutely delicious. The palak paneer had a perfect warm spinach flavour and the paneer was very nice and tender. Naan was nice and light, with a bit too much butter, but very fresh. And the biryani had the perfect ratio of vegetables to rice!  I'm very pleasantly surprised, I wish we had a place like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Montréal so far. Great ambiance and delicious Punjabi food. I am regular to this place and their Chef never disappointed me. Try their lamb dishes with Naan. Try mango lassi to cool down after some hot and spicy food ;) Try their Baryani if you happen to be a rice person."}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious food, not expensive at all, good service and decor! Their Naam bread is something from another world! Amazing! Also, the Thali plate is huge, delicious and cheap! You eat like a king for less than 20$! I'll end my review now cause it makes me crave their food!!! :P"}
{"text":"Pathetic, overrated place! Poor service, bad food, nope! Not my thing.."}
{"text":"Singh's has a lovely ambience, affordable prices, pleasant staff and owner as well as delicious Indian food that hits the mark ! If you are craving some and are in the area, you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I am a tourist perhaps from Toronto and this is the beat Indian food experience ever. Everything was like I was trying it for the first time. The food, decor and even ambience. It was something I always searched for in Toronto but could never find. I'd come back to Montreal just to eat here again."}
{"text":"The most authentic Indian food in Montreal. Delicious curries and the best biryanis. The service is very good and we don't have to wait for a long time for the food to arrive. If you're planning a wine and dine with some friends, Singh's is the destination for you."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Montreal! Singh is also a lovely guy himself. Would recommend their lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, and mutter paneer."}
{"text":"Great bring your own.  I eat here every time in Montreal.  Food is very authentic.  Naan is fresh from tandoor.  Owner and staff are friendly and attentive.  Great value and experience."}
{"text":"The place is good but the taste of their Biryani and paneer tikka is same. We ordered a veg thali and they didn't have any curry options. The salad seemed to be frozen one. Moreover while we were eating our paneer tikka they bought our thali at the same time, hence naan and everything else went cold within few minutes. There is a difference between Starters and main course... and I don't eat everything at once!! Onions in paneer tikka were rotten so I didn't really enjoyed the tikka and rest of the food"}
{"text":"Great find as we were lost, but wow what Great food! The service could use a little help but the host is always very very welcoming and always remembers us when we come in. This place is small but quaint and very authentic and the food comes with some HEAT if you want it. Spend the time, come here and sit in the booths, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and it was fantastic!  Saag, butter chicken, and naan were all delicious.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  I definitely would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm still reeling from the mysterious loss of Chef Guru's thali plates. When is it ever wise to go forth, after a breakup, looking for something to fill the void, but always comparing that new thing to your ex? Is that ever really truly fair?  My approach to Indian restaurants, like my approach to breakfast places, tends to rest mostly on a single dish/plate: For breakfast places, it's just two eggs over easy and bacon; for Indian joints, it's their thalis.  Here at Singh's, it's.... okay. The Tandoori chicken was reasonably fresh and tasty. The lamb curry, a little nondescript, sadly. Rice is rice, and the naan was pretty good. No papadum. Of course, what is a thali plate without Curiously Sad Iceberg Lettuce Salad Syndrome(tm)?   I simply cannot understand why this is on the plate. Sometimes they come with those pathetic \"baby\" carrots you get in a bag. Who started this thing? Is this to cleanse my palate? From what? Why can't the Habs score to save a life this year? Will we really see a Pink Metro line in our lifetime? What's the meaning of life? SO MANY QUESTIONS.  As per service, well, what can you say. Aside from the perfunctory functions of bringing your food and taking your money, don't expect much here. Despite being the *only* customer on a quiet weekday afternoon, there was no service to speak of.  All in all, this gets a rating of Iceberg out of Lettuce."}
{"text":"Singh's was a let-down in terms of their service. After reading all the amazing reviews about their food, I was ecstatic to try them out. However, it took a good 40 minutes to an hour for it to even arrive! The waiters even forgot our mango lassi, and only brought it when we reminded them. The food was good though, however. I ordered a palek paneer (my vegetarian go-to) with tandoori roti, and they were both pretty good. After our meal, we had to wait for another 15 minutes for the bill because the person on the counter was on the phone. It was just a lot of waiting to do. Overall, I would recommend the food here because it was quite good (as an Indian food lover though, I don't think it was anything special/phenomenal), but I wouldn't go here if I didn't have the time or the patience to wait for an hour."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the butter chicken, lentils, cheese kapora (which came with 3 chutneys), garlic naan and rice. Great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant indien qui comble toutes mes attentes. Un menu complet et varié , service sympatique et qualité exceptionnelle. Un apportez votre vin qui ne gonfle pas les prix pour compenser le manque a gagner. Aussi bon que n'importe quel resto visité lors de nos deux voyages en Inde."}
{"text":"Went there on a date with my best friend and completely fell in love ! The food was really good It really tasted like real Indian food. The interior was gorgeous. Totally recommend this place. The staff were really friendly and the owner kept checking in on us to see how we enjoyed the food and asked how we liked the restaurant. Simple gestures like that really make customers feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, food  as great they really tried hard to make sure our visit was a pleasant one.  I ended up forgetting a bag with a dress in it, I immediately called and they said they would contact me during their clean up Time and sure enough before 11pm called me and reassured me that they have the bag waiting!  Honest, Caring, kind people!"}
{"text":"Great BYOW Indian place on St-Laurent. The palak paneer was delicious and very flavorful. The meat was on the dry side though (we had the butter chicken), but the sauce was perfect. Naan bread was fluffy yet crispy, and I would recommend picking coconut rice 100%. Do try the 2 specialty desserts: ras malai which is like a crustless cheesecake in sweet cream, and gulab jamun which is a honey-soaked fried ball of dough. SO. GOOD.  I now want to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"This is a review for a large delivery - not the restaurant experience. We wanted to have people over for a celebration and also wanted vegetarian Indian food. So, I came in a few days before, made an order for 12 people, and even got a 10% discount on the delivery menu prices. The whole process was very friendly and painless. They even offered me tea while they were taking the order. I had to pay a small cash deposit and the rest was paid on delivery. I called to add a couple of things on the day of the event, and it was no problem.  Delivery arrived on the agreed upon time, the food was hot, nothing was missing from the order, and it tasted excellent. I even had leftovers for the next day.  If you need to host, I warmly recommend their take out / delivery!"}
{"text":"The food tasted ok but salty. We had waited so long over 30 mins with nothing. Other customers who came after us already ate their food all. The fish chili & lamb 'a portions were quite small. Never come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, warm service and tasty food. Located at the old Bhudda bar, this cute small restaurant will probably please you  They will also accommodate you if you can't eat as spice as Indian food normally is... :)  Owners are very friendly and can accommodate your group of friends for a dinner even on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. The butter chicken had perfect amount of spice and naans we're soft and tasty. I must say however service is Really poor. We had no one to really look after us even when there wasn't a rush. We had to keep reminding the servers for what we requested and at one point they were more into cleaning up than even seeing that we needed something. Overall great food would recommend take out and not dine in!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience!  You would never think this was as good as it was based on the outside. The service was wonderful!  Pleasant, great food recommendations and price was decent. We brought our own wine so that was good too. The curried lamb was amazing as were the other 2 chicken dishes we ordered. (Don't recall the names) Nan bread was fresh out of the oven and delicious! Atmosphere was comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"Hands down to this restaurant, as a Indian food lover, I always have the tendency to look for the best especially for consistency and freshness of the spices. Singh's fascinated me and I fell in love with their food and restaurant. This restaurant is very cutely decorated with Indian puppets and idols. In addition, it is very clean.  I went for the vegetarian thaali and it consisted of rice, naan, and 3 vegetable dishes. I had the aubergine, dal and kofta. They were all delicious and so filling but as I loved their naans because they were so soft and melted in my mouth as well as the crunch of the naan. In other words, just cooked to perfection. I'd definitely go back to try other dishes at this restaurant. Plus it only cost me $6.99 for this dish which I found really cheap compared to other restaurant. I'd definitely recommend it if you want the real authentic foods from India and Punjab as you'd definitely fall in love with that place just like I did today. My tummy is a happy camper after this sumptuous meal at Singh's.   :)"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food! Had the shrimp saag, and hubs had the chicken vindaloo. We also shared an order of veg samosas. The samosas were extremely flavorful,  and huge! My saag was spicier than I am used to but not in a bad way. My hubs loves spicy food and found the vindaloo \"really hot!\" I would definitely come back if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Rude waitress. Telling me price asking if I really wanted to order what I ordered. I know how to read a menu you dumbass. Sub par food. Veg curry not fully cooked. Salad wasn't fresh. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"The food here was really, really good. The best Indian style food I've had in Montréal so far.  I ordered my vegetarian go-to: shahi paneer, palao rice, and samosa. I was not disappointed. Particularly good was the channa samosa; I hadn't had it served \"wet\" before. Very, very good. The palao was tasty too.  The service was also good and (who I assume is) the proprietor was friendly and helpful. They also have a gigantic goldfish that I'm kind of a fan of after sitting next to him/her at dinner. :)"}
{"text":"highly recommand for the butter chicken. Nan was delicious. Only soup was too spicy for the beginning."}
{"text":"Ate here three days straight during our visit to Montreal. Simply the best Indian food in town. Do order the Daal Tadka (yellow daal) and Achaari Chicken with Butter Tandoori Roti."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service rather deplorable. Went there with two friends, all of us Indian.   Firstly, the server who initially greeted us lead us to a nicely located booth, but then the manager came in and asked us to sit in a table in the middle of the restaurant, claiming that the booth was \"reserved\". It seemed that no such reservation was in place, as after a while when a group of white people came in who also had no reservation, they were lead to the said booth.   Secondly, we had ordered a vegetable jhalfrezi, but our server returned with a lamb jhalfrezi - he was quite casual about it and said \"eat this, this is better\". While he was aware of his mistake, he didn't offer us a vegetable jhalfrezi, and in the end we were charged for the lamb jhalfrezi which was slightly more expensive than the vegetarian jhalfrezi.   This was a disappointing experience and I wouldn't like to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place hasn't gotten more reviews. This was my first Indian restaurant in Montreal and was hesitant because I'm wasn't sure how it would turn out. The food was really good. We asked for it spicy and boy was it spicy! Usually b Indian restaurant cater to their demographic audience but Singh made sure it was authentic. The service was phenomenal and took care of you. I had an issue with the meter and the guy as the front came out and explained it to me. Only knocking it one star because their service size was on the smaller size but was still plenty. Their naans were really small though. My family and I, at other Indian restaurants only order 3 naan and we will be stuffed, here we had to order 5. Both overall, the service was good, decor was decent and food was tasty. If you had to choose between this restaurant and darbar down the street, go with Singh's. Darbar was garbage and the owner was unprofessional."}
{"text":"Que ce soit pour une commande pour emporter, ou un souper BYOB en semaine, Singh's est une super option.   Lorsqu'on est deux, on prend habituellement le poulet au beurre et l'agneau madrasa avec des samosas et oignons bhaji en entrée (et n'oublions pas le pain naan) - c'est plus qu'assez et incroyablement bon.   Pour ajouter à l'expérience, la famille qui s'occupe du restaurant sont hyper gentils."}
{"text":"One of the best Indians restaurants that I have been to - tried fish pakora, chana masala, fish curry, and garlic naan. From out of town, but would definitely come back when we return!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to go here for a while, having tried most of the other Indian Thali places in both downtown and the plateau. We finally went as a group of three and each ordered a Lunch Special, two butter chicken thalis and a vegetable thali, as well as two appetizers. First the server brought a fantastic water jug and metal goblet-like cups to our table. We enjoyed pretending to be royalty. Our onion bajis and paneer pakoras came quickly and were incredibly fresh, a rare occurrence in cheaper Indian restos. They were accompanied by three sauces; a salty bright green mint cucumber dip, a sweet tamarind dip, and what seemed to be a (very) spicy mango. Soon after this our thali plates came, piled high with rice, naan, and a small simple salad. The butter chicken plate also came with tandoori chicken, which was very moist and flavourful. However, the serving sizes between the plates were inconsistent. The butter chicken had a thick, creamy sauce that was mildly sweet but uncommonly savoury (a good thing!). The veg plate came with a vegetable korma in a rich cream sauce, which was agreed to be the best part of anyone's meal. There was also some sort of tasty dal. Both plates came with a green pepper and mushroom curry that was very tender. The rice was average and the naan seemed homemade and fresh, but not as thick as found in some other restaurants, but better than the dry flat ones found commonly.  It was raining when we came in, and owner kindly showed us where to leave our umbrellas. When paying he wanted feedback and was very friendly. Overall very impressed with this place, much better than the competitors within two blocks. Tasteful decor and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have never felt more welcomed by someone than walking into Singh's. maybe even more welcome here than my friends houses. Anyways I ordered the Baigan Bartha and it was the best Indian and one of the best meals I've had."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the city, and we've tried a few. The food is great and spicy when it should be. The prices are average, and the portions are generally generous. The best part though is that it's BYOB. We save so much  money eating out when we can BYOB.  I came here for my birthday dinner and they have a prix fixe menu for large groups on weekends. I think it was $23/pp and there was SO much food. Pakoras, chana masala, butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, tons of rice, etc. Like way more food than we could have possibly eaten. They offered for us to take the leftovers home, but unfortunately we were going out after and couldn't take it. They were just a little weird about setting the table for us though - I had reserved for I think 12 or so and they only set it for 10 and wouldn't add the other two chairs until the people got there, so when they got there it kind of felt like they didn't have chairs and were forgotten from the reservation or something. Besides that though the service has been good and pretty quick."}
{"text":"This is a great bring your own wine Indian restaurant.  Like most Indian restaurants, its nice to share a few dishes with a group.  I usually get the channa samosa to start and then a few vegetarian dishes with some rice and naan bread. I've tried the aloo gobhi, the saag paneer and the tarka dahl. All delicious. Once I went with a friend who prefers meat so we got a chicken dish as well. The meat was very tender and the sauce was great, but the amount of chicken was a bit sparse considering the price.  Other than that minuscule complaint, which is really more of an observation than a complaint, this place is has it all.  The owners are also great and very funny. I hope they will be very successful and I will certainly do my part to help!"}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from a fair amount of Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood, and many have been good, but Singh's has been the best. Portions are generous (I've gotten six good meals out of a ~$30 order!) and none of the dishes I've tried has been a dud. I just ran out of leftovers from my last order and dang, those were good leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for taste, value and service! The lunch veg thali is a great value for $6.99. The meal was really tasty and both the servers were very polite and attentive. We were a group of 14 and they accommodated us for lunch without any issues. It was after 1:30 on a week day so we had the place to ourselves. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"The paneer dish, daal, and naan were good- enjoyed that more than the punjabi channa. Staff was friendly and very accommodating to our group of 8."}
{"text":"Singh's is such a warm, inviting, friendly place to have dinner. Majit (?) and Karishma are so hospitable and sweet! The food is absolutely amazing!! My husband and I truly enjoyed this restaurant and if we lived in Montreal, it would surely become a weekly hangout :)"}
{"text":"This Indian place on St. Laurent is a bring your own wine place. It serves the north Indian Punjabi food. The place is decorated well, with Indian pictures hanging around the wall. The lotus lighting add a beautiful ambience to the place. With a very versatile menu, I was literally confused about ordering the food. My husband ordered their lunch special lamb curry thalis.  And I ordered their alloo parantha with raita.  Their lam b curry was delicious, and he alloo parantha is the best I had in Montreal. This would be my go to place for the aaloo parantha from now.   PS: the owner of the place is usually serving himself and takes special care of the guests."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST INDIAN RESTAURANT IN MONTREAL. Hands. Down.   Butter chicken? Best in Montreal. Lamb Khorma? Best in MTL. Palak paneer? Best in Montreezy. Baingan bharta? Best in Montropolopolous.   DO YOU SEE A RECURRING THEME HERE?  Add to that THE NICEST owners and servers in the entire Belle Province, and you've got a winning combination.   BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.   It's also one of the most reasonably priced Indian restaurants I've been to. #SaveThatMoney  IN CONCLUSION  If you're blue and you don't know where to go to Why don't you go where Harlem flits Puttin' on the r... Singh's."}
{"text":"After having bad past experiences with Indian food I finally mounted the courage to try it again. The experience at singh's was extraordinary. Loved EVERYTHING!!!!! the butter chicken was great as was the chicken tika. Their naan (garlic bread) is to die for. The waitress was so pleasant and helpful with her great recommendations. Their manga lassi as a beverage was very nice. Finally we met the owner, manjit, who is a true gentleman. I'd rate this place 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Nice, new Indian location in the plateau.  The decor is pleasant and cosy.  The food was good with lots of menu options.  Service was alright."}
{"text":"It took 1h 20 min for a delivery on a tuesday night. Will never order from this place again. Food was ok. Delivery guy said its an external company and they just called him 10 min ago and it took him 5 min to get to my place. Had to call the restaurant three time to check if the food is coming, the first time it was after 45 min of waiting and they seem like the order was not initiated."}
{"text":"The dal is too spicy for Canadian standards. Malai Kofta was undercooked and Kadai panner was fine. The quantity per plate is small which is a bummer considering the prices.The service was delayed even though we were the only people in the resturant."}
{"text":"Apportez votre vin + bouffe indienne = bonheur. C'est ce que j'ai expérimenté, hier soir,en allant chez Singh's. Les restos indiens \"BYOB\" à l'extérieur de Parc Ex sont assez rare et celui-ci se démarque du lot en commençant par sa décoration. La lumière est tamisé, pour faire changement des ampoules fluo-compacte, il y a des banquettes pour 4 personnes qui vous donnent plus d'intimité....bref, on voit qu'ils ont porté une attention à l'ambiance!  Pour le menu, tout est très bon. Ma copine et moi avons pris deux thalis, un végé et un à la viande ainsi que des bajhi à l'oignon et une soupe au tomate en entrée. Le tout est accompagné de pain naan et de sauces qui vous permette de doser votre niveaux de \"Spicy\".  Le service est excellent. On s'assure que tout est à votre goût, que tout les plats arrivent chaud à votre table dans un délais raisonnables et ce avec une attention chaleureuse. Le tout pour 40$ taxes et tips inclus!!!!!!!  Rajouter le à votre liste, vous ne serez pas déçu!"}
{"text":"Today, we girls had night out and took a decision to order the veggie food from Singh's. It was such an amazing experience to have a yummy food. Thanks Singh's for making our night.."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here last night and LOVED the green tikka chicken with salad and coconut rice on the side. Very light and refreshing if you don't like creamy/thick sauces like me. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely over priced! I ordered the shrimp vindaloo and it was a whopping 15 dollars and it did not include rice or naan. To top things off it came in an extremely small bowl and it was mostly potatoes. The only thing that was fairly priced that I bought were the vegetarian samosas. The service that I received was also lackluster; the waitress only came to take my order and serve the food. I definitely will not be visiting here again."}
{"text":"I love indian food! When i would crave it, i would drive all the way to park-ex to have a good meal. I was craving indian food and wanted to try out a new restaurant. So i searched in Yelp and stumbled on this one. Only 5 stars review! Great!!!  When my husband and i entered the restaurant, we were hit with so many delicious aromas and our mouths started salivating lol! A lot of choices on the menu. I chose the lamb curry thali which came with stewed vegetables, basmati rice, salad, naan bread, a tandoori chicken drumstick and a lamb stew. All that for only 10.99$! My husband chose a lentil soup, pulao rice, naan stuffed with meat and rogan josh chicken. Everything was so, so, so good!!! The portions were generous, the prices are great! With tax and tips, the meal costed us 43$. The service excellent! And to top it off, it's a byob! Last but not least, it's about 5-8 minutes drive from my place. I no longer need to go all the way to park-ex! One or perhaps the best indian restaurant i've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Love the food  If you want something spicy this is the place The Chicken tikka massalah and the biryani really fills you up and leaves your stomach smiling"}
