{"text":"Hidden gem in the internationally soulful food court at Plaza Cote-Des-Neiges, staffed by a sweet couple. They seem to cater to the work lunch crowd with their ready-to-eat sushi packs, but since we had some time, we had our orders made fresh. Not a huge exotic selection, which is actually better since they can focus a little more on their core dishes. Got the tempura roll and the rainbow roll, as well as a miso soup. Everything was well-prepared and excellent. No bells and whistles, just great sushi. Thankfully, I frequent the Plaza often, so I'll definitely be back!"}

{"text":"Love all my visits to this store. Its small convenient and sushi's are just yummy. I came in early today to cut line up for WalMart and came down the food court to get some chow on. My go to places here are varied but somehow the sushi was calling me in. Anyway I got shrimp tempura 5 piece and avocado 6 piece all for 9.66 and they also gave me a nice yummy cup of hot tea to go with my meal. Couldn't have been more satisfied. The food is delicious and the people friendly. Worth coming here if you're nearby the mall"}
{"text":"I have to say, I have been looking for a good sushi place for a long time, and Goong sushi finally met my standards.  Having been out west and having had much better sushi, I am glad that I can enjoy similar sushi here.  The sushi place is is a somewhat run down mall, but the booth itself rather attractive.  I had the 12 piece sushi plate.  There was some california rolls, avocado, cucumber and salmon rolls. The rice was perfect and judging by the taste it was made the day of.  The raw salmon was decent and everything in was in the right proportions (not too much rice etc).  Definitely recommended and will go back."}
