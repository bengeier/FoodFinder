{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich and inexpensive too. A bit of a wait, but worth it. Nice staff. Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Outstanding espresso - ruffino beans. And the brunch puts the leslieville staples to shame. Skip the lines at lady marmalade or bonjour brioche and come here instead."}
{"text":"Best bacon EVER!  And fried avocado!  And weirdly cheap!  And they are attentive about refilling coffee and water!  LOVE."}
{"text":"Chimi pork belly was the reason I brought my husband here for fathers day and it met all expectations. Fresh herby chimi sauce and three massive strips of tender pork belly. I had to steal some even though I don't like visible fat on meat, but clearly one gets over such an aversion when you are eating pork belly!


French toast was perfect, thick smoked bacon was as delicious as the pork belly, and even the fries were pretty damn good. 


Displaced Aussies will love that they have a flat white on the menu and this new mama loved that the place was very child friendly. Sporting a change table outside of the bathroom stalls means my husband gets the luxury of changing the baby too ;)


Not super speedy, but that's not the point. If you want a delicious brunch, strong coffee and a sunny window, sit back and enjoy the wait. Its worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food / coffee and service . Great place for take out or eat in.  Breakfast sandwich fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and different, would go back again. We both had the Chimi Pork, fries with around four slices of pork belly and two poached eggs. The churri sauce is light, not strong. And the other was the standard, came with two slices of bacon, not your regular bacon strips. Nutella mocha and latte was also delicious, one of the better drinks i've had. Music was a tad loud so had to speak up but didn't really bother me. Nice little brunch spot close to home!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I also like that they don't charge excessively like other brunch places. Further, their portion sizes are filling! 

Definitely a place to check out. The bacon is amazing !"}
{"text":"I think that Barbra D must have been in a different place.. The food was amazing with a great menu. Service was also excellent. I would recommend this little brunch/ coffee place for sure!"}
{"text":"Got a very tasty breakfast. Coffee was a bit strong and I got milk instead of cream but so minor compared to the overall experience."}
{"text":"The Food:  Fresh and delicious.  Everything that can be made in house is made in house.  The bread used for the burgers and sandwiches can change every day since it is made fresh every day.  Ever had panko crusted deep-fried advocado?  Me neither.  Until now.  Delicious.  Especially with the house made aoli.  All of the veggies on my sandwich were nicely grilled and the fries were crispy.  

The Cost:  Super reasonable!  How many places in TO can you order a large homemade burger with all the toppings on house-baked bread that comes with a pile of crispy fries and a homemade garlic aioli for under $10?  And from what my carnivorous friends tell me, it's fantastic.

The Staff:  Friendly and attentive.  Happy to accommodate any request I have made during my many visits.  I'm a vegetarian.  No problem, we will modify what we can!  I drink a lot of water with my meals.  No problem, here is a jug of ice water just for you.

The Atmosphere:  Cool, casual, minimalist.  A mix of high-top tables, regular style tables, and one large group table.  

In short:  Welcome to the neighbourhood Ashdale Brunch and Espresso.  I'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"food is great! prices are very affordable, staff is very friendly. good vibes and good music. the 5$ coffee and biscuit breakfast sandwich is awesome"}
{"text":"This is a great place for coffee, or to get some lunch. I had a delicious Grilled Cheese sandwich, with fresh greens. The coffee options are good at a reasonable price. The reason I give 5 stars is for the exceptional service! I visit Toronto often, and appreciate being greeted like I'm a regular by their friendly, professional staff!"}
{"text":"Quaint neighborhood restaurant with great food, coffee, and service. Our go to is the Birds Nest, and the Apple Fritters are to die for.

Friendly staff, very few lines, great for kids too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and scrumptious brunch menu. Eggs Benny are high quality and service is always prompt and cheerful. The Ashdale is a much needed breath of fresh air in a bit of a dead zone in Leslieville.

I hear the Ashdale has plans to extend hours and potentially open up a patio. If they do, you know where to find me."}
{"text":"I was staying with some friends in Toronto over the weekend, and decided to venture out and grab some breakfast on my own. Considering this looked like my best option within walking distance, I chose to check out this little joint to get my brekkie on. Not sure if i was just really hungry, or if everything on the menu just seemed to be screaming my name. Simple fare, but edgy, and innovative. I wanted it all. That being said, I ordered the French Toast with Bacon. I feel you can probably judge any breakfast/brunch place based on their french toast AND their bacon, so this was a perfect combo. 

Wow. This is easily the BEST french toast I've ever had in my life. No joke. The edges were crispy, and there was a bit of salty notes that played well with the sweet caramelization happening. And, it may have been in my head, but i think there was a citrusy tone as well...which I'm not typically into when it comes to french toast, but holy cow....this stuff blew me away. It didn't look like much on the plate as far as presentation, but i mean...i didn't even care after biting into it. Oh, and let's talk about the bacon. THANK you for serving thick cut bacon. None of this wussy little soggy bacon crap. This bacon was thick, salty, and i want some more right now. 

I've recommended this place already to others. And if i'm back in Toronto...will be going back for SURE."}
{"text":"LAWD HAVE MERCY, this place is actually fantastic. I've had nearly everything they've ever offered and I can't say anything was just ok. It was all delicious, even the menu items that sounded questionable turned out to be amazing. The chef is extremely talented and obviously took time with the menu. My recommendation is go with a friend and get the avocado fries and two mains, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The wait and service is ridiculous.. A new place yes, but they need to figure out their work rotation because waiting an hour for a plate of food is not acceptable.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here because he went once and really liked the food. My first impression is that there's nothing fancy about this place, decor is very minimal. The table we sat at didn't feel clean and was semi sticky. Our waitress notified us when we were ready to order that they were out of the juice of the day, as well as a couple other options from the menu which sucked because they were all vegetarian options so I didn't have much to chose from. But nonetheless our waitress was super chill. 

I ended up getting the grilled cheese and my boyfriend got the burger and fries. I enjoyed my food and liked how the flavour of pesto in the grilled cheese. My boyfriend didn't particularly like his burger because the bun was cold. The fries were ok, didn't taste too fresh. 

I'd come back but hopefully they'll have a fully stocked menu."}
{"text":"A good spot to have a coffee and enjoy the Queen E. breeze. Although be warned the food is not good - the potatoes in the hash tasted stale. So did the majority of the other meals."}
{"text":"So rarely does a restaurant's food quality match its service...in this case though, both were a bust.  Went there for brunch and was not impressed.

Super slow service - I think one server was working the entire restaurant.  Had to ask for everything from cutlery to water to coffee refills.  There seemed to be a lot of employees sort of lingering behind the bar doing various, non-essential things that didn't improve the restaurant experience.

Basic food fare - besides the fact that not everything arrived (but was left on the bill) the food was not impressive.  The BLT wrap was a very loose, small portion with very little flavor in the aioli and served solo on a white plate.  The Bird's Nest looked similarly minimalist and unappealing and came with default poached eggs because the server forgot to ask egg preference.

This place probably lends itself better to being as espresso bar than a restaurant because the coffee was pretty good, and the staff were very friendly...just not so great at restauranting."}
{"text":"Great coffees; nice teas too. Excellent breaky and lunches. My favorite are the daily specials; each one unique and tasty. The outside seating is nice. Heading into colder weather and will be awesome on warmer days. Kyle is flexible with your eating preferences- he aims to please. A must stop when we come to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"I'm really sad to be writing a review like this but honesty is the best criticism to improve any establishment. 
I suggested to come back here after my drop in a couple months ago because the atmosphere was good and the service was friendly. 
I knew the menu was changing so when I saw their updated items through their Facebook page. . I was excited and intrigued. 
Walking in here at the same time on the same day of the week, everything was quite the opposite from my first visit. 
This time,  it was super busy,  people were not really attentive and the staff was overwhelmed. 
After waiting 10 mins and the waitress serving the table that came in after us,  I went to the front to order my drink... I also ordered the yogurt parfait which I was excited to see a healthier option... supposed to be topped with berries and granola.

When it came,  you could've fooled me.  What I got was a giant cup of yogurt... three sliced mini strawberries and 1 tablespoon of granola and a touch of honey.  If I knew I was ordering yogurt w. Garnish,  I would've skipped it and went straight for the Benny.  At least I knew I would be getting two eggs, English muffin and sauce.  This was misleading ans truly a disappointment.

Not to my surprise,  I heard at least two other complaints while I was there.  
Not sure what's happening but I hope things shape up."}
{"text":"Did a take out brunch and we enjoyed the food. Very affordable with prices much lower than other restaurants serving brunch. The place has more of a coffee shop feel to it and it's not too big. 

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'd like to give the Ashdale 3.5 stars. We've had brunch for the last two Sundays. The service and coffee are 5/5. Also 5/5 for the quality of the homemade food, it's well prepared, healthy, and delicious. My biggest issue is the consistently unavailable menu items. They've been sold out of the french toast and mac and cheese both times we've gone (and we're there more at a breakfast hour than a true brunch time). This is a pet peeve of mine. If you can't execute the menu, change the menu! I really wanted to try that french toast. Small deduction for the uncomfortable chairs as well, although I like the ambiance in general. Bacon can be subbed for the house-made chorizo sausage for some meals: I would not recommend. The chorizo was extremely dry and under-seasoned, while the bacon was delicious. Also, the washrooms downstairs are a little scary, but maybe they'll get around to cleaning those up a bit? Love the house-made bread and the french fries (they've nailed the fries-instead-of-homefries thing, they're delicious)."}
{"text":"Cute brunch place in the east end. Service was quick and friendly. The prices were fair. The coffee was great. 

I had a grilled cheese sandwich and shared a blueberry waffle with my husband. Both were good, nothing spectacular but nothing bad. The portion sizes were fairly small. My only criticism is that everything we ate we could have easily made ourselves at home. I guess that means it really is home-cooked food? For what we wanted, it was alright, I guess it would have been nice to have something with a bit more \"pizzazz\"."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that given the kind of service, price and very low standards of cleanliness that anyone would have given this more than 2 stars. I tend to trust reviewers who've got a lot of reviews under their belt, and, granted most of the reviews thus far (except one) were first time reviews (which always make me skeptical because, of course, no photos of reviewers which leads me to think it's written by the owner/chef/staff). So, here it goes - 1. First thing we see on a hot day Sloppy writing on the chalk board out front.We walk in, it's a hot morning, doors and windows closed, no a/c, room is stuffy. No one greets us, all of the staff are standing around at the cash, so we figure that there's no table service. We stand at the door for a few minutes - still nothing. I go up to the cash and ask and we're told there is table service. We seat ourselves (extremely uncomfortable chairs). Our server is friendly but the water glasses are half of a standard sized water glass in any other food establishment in the city - so, even more dependance on the slowish servers and more waiting for water refills. We were given menus - because of the cavernous ceilings, and irritating hipster electronica (better suited for an after hours bar than a neighbourhood/family friendly breakfast/brunch place) we can barely make out what's being said (to be clear - none of us have hearing issues). Unfortunately the menu doesn't offer information that would be useful when deciphering ingredients (for the average meal-goer) such has explanations of what harisa and chimi churri are. There are typos (\"poach eggs\"), which for such a small, ingredient specific (and overpriced) menu are really unacceptable (I tend to overlook this in many restaurants where English is not a first language, however, this doesn't appear to be the case here, just laziness). No drinks (coffee/tea/juices) are listed? Nothing to indicate if they're licensed or not. Lame-o common table in the centre - hell, if I'm paying that much money for a meal then I'm not sharing a table, unless it's with my group of friends/family. We both ordered the exact same dish and one was brought out and the second came 5 (!) minutes later. Really?? It wasn't busy or crowded, so what gives? Portions are RIDICULOUSLY small. The english muffins on which the eggs benny come (they must also be house made because no self-respecting baker would sell these) are more akin to slider size and the salad (I asked) was said to have a 'light dressing'. And by 'light' it was completely non-existent. Never in my life (amongst many continents and multiple countries) have I walked away hungry from a breakfast/brunch - until now. I paid $11 for a miniscule (below average tasting) eggs benny with a tiny amount of salad (not free range eggs, not organic greens, nothing notable except the disappointing portion size. The servers are friendly but clearly inexperienced and unseasoned. I feel like the chef here just watched too many cooking shows on tv and through osmosis decided he was actually a chef. Oh, and while you're eating? You get the distinct smell of dirty mop water wafting across the open kitchen, cash and onto the restaurant floor. Why is that? The dishwasher is doing dishes directly beside where the food is being prepared and cooked. Our dirty dishes sit untouched until we finally just get up to go pay the bill. The bathrooms are filthy. Paper towel dispenser completely empty first thing in the morning. The steps leading down to them are steep and unsafe (God help anyone with a toddler or over the age of 20 trying to navigate them. Or anywhere else for that matter. I feel utterly ripped off, taken advantage of and disappointed. Pity the poor souls who think this is the next manna from heaven. This place feels like they're just trying to take advantage of people, over charge,under deliver and get away with it. It incenses me that establishments like this exist. They've been open long enough to have ironed out any initial problems, so no sympathy here. Ashdale Brunch & Espresso, I'm sad to say that you truly disappoint. Go anywhere else but here - please!. Frankly (and anyone who knows my tastes can tell you I'm not a supporter of corporate/chemical/GMO foods), you're better off going across the street to the (conveniently located) McDonald's. You'll get your own table, better service, and a better portion size - all at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the French toast and Mediterranean bowel but the bowel wasn't available. 
Tried the French toast which was AMAZING! Sourdough bread and eggbatter was great probably be best thing on the menu. 
Chimi pork was extremely disappointing, pork belly could be crispier, chimi sauce was a lazy mans sauce just tasted like blended cilantro, presentation wasn't impressive either.
Florentine benny was described to be delicious but the roasted red pepper seemed like it was out of a can, the asparagus was chopped up and not fresh so possibly from a can as well.

Great location especially with the patio edition, has so much potential to do really well, but the menu and chef seem uninspired. I would have given 1 star if it wasn't for the French toast."}
{"text":"I love the open kitchen, so you can see the chef and sous chef hustle and bustle away. The food here are made with love and  very delicious, they bake their own bread, cure their own pork belly just to name a few.

The Standard:
Huge portion and love their home made bread.

Chimi Pork:
Huge portion and comes with at least 5 good strips of pork belly, and the chimi chirri sauce is spot on.

BLT Wrap:
It is a really good wrap with all the tastes you want and prepared fresh.

Say \"Cheese\" Burger:
Juicy and flavourful.

The staff are friendly, but just make sure you have time to spare during peak brunch hours because you really have to be patient to wait for your food to come. But it's worth the wait for it's scrumptious and affordable."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant. 

First of all, it's all homemade. From the in-house smoked salmon to the delicious freshly baked breads that change daily. 

The chef works in an open work space and was very friendly and clearly takes great pride in his creations, as he should because everything was delicious. 

We tried the Smoked Salmon Benny as well as the Chimi Pork and Eggs. We concluded the meal with the Nutella Cake (Nutella cake with cream cheese espresso whip and caramel). It was sort of reminiscent of a nutty sticky date pudding but a million times better with a perfect level of sweetness. 

The staff were were pleasant. The space is itself is nice.

We also stopped in for a quickly breaky. My bf and I each had a biscuit along with our espresso beverages and the biscuits were 5/5.

****************************************
Update, there is a new chef who is nice but the place has lost what I loved about it. No more homemade bread :( Muffins are very average and taste like they're from a mix (sorry, if they're not!). Wait staff still friendly. Now it's just okay and no longer delights me. Coffee is good!"}
