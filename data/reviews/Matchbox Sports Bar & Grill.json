{"text":"An amazing experience! After a poor experience in town I came back to the Days Inn. I stopped by the bar for (what I thought) was going to be ONE drink. While there, I was blown away with the customer service and all around friendliness of the bartender named Tammy. Being from out of town, Tammy made me feel right at home! I can't recommend this place enough for anyone who is remotely close to this bar."}
{"text":"I happened to be staying at the Days Hotel in Peoria and I didn't feel like leaving for food.  So, I went to Matchbox, had some dinner, and a few brews.

It was a slow night, but the bartender kept the drinks coming, and I had a good time. I'd go back, if I were ever in the area again.

OH!  I had some big burger.  The Matchbox Burger, maybe?  I forget the name...  Double-meat and cheese and all sorts of other stuff.  It was good.  The fries...?  Meh.  Fresh-cutting some fries could help the fries live up to the burger they're next to.  :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food. Horse track racing available, waitress was excellent very friendly would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers, great atmosphere, having the horse races is a plus and clean pool tables.  Have been back more than 10 times.  Oh and another plus if you get to drunk its connected to a motel. Nice clean bar will continue going back often."}
{"text":"Pictures look better than the actual place. The bar is inside the lobby of a motel.  You have to go through the motel lobby to get into the bar. They don't have a big selection of liquor. I ordered a Tito's tonic and No Tito's. The well vodka gave me a hangover after like two drinks. Would go again as a last resort. But only for beer."}
