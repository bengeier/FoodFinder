{"text":"Worse lox I've ever had and cost an arm and leg.... I'll never get a lox from this deli again.."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp, have been to the area before and found this gem on this trip, loved the omelets and pancakes. Quick and real good can't wait for our next trip to the the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"My wife and I love their bagels.  They toast up crispy and every variety has lots of flavor.  Their patio is our favorite Saturday morning coffee and bagel spot in the Valley.  Nice folks inside and their breakfast items are delicious.  Well worth a stop."}
{"text":"JJ's deli created an incredible display of sandwiches, chips, pickles, and condiments for a large off site party this week.  All I can say is, the food was delicious, the displays were classy and they thought of everything!  The best experience I have had organizing an event."}
{"text":"Few things can fix a crappy day like a good sandwich. I went to JJ's for the first time and ordered Rogers TBLT. It came out quickly, was absolutely gorgeous, and the taste did not disappoint. My 4 year old is currently chowing down on a plain cream cheese bagel. My only regret is that I won't  be able to eat here again for a long time since we're flying back home to the frozen North soon."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood deli. Whether its their yummy bagels, their awesome\"just can't beet salad\" or the most scrumptious Rueben sandwich ever.... I'm never disappointed and I've been going here for years now!"}
{"text":"Roger's TBLT sandwich is the best sandwick in the world.   One day he. stood next to me and  declaired it the best sandwihch in the world. He looked at it and said: \"That's my sandwich.\"  I thought he meant since he owned the place it was his. NO! He designed it.  The best sandwich in the world and I get to read newspapers.  There really is a GOD."}
{"text":"This used to be kashmans but honestly, the only thing they had that you guys don't is the jalapeño infused bacon southwestern omelet. I always thought they were so rude and never understood why they're customers we're so loyal... Must have been the food!!! Love the place now!! Much better atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best deli's in Phoenix, homemade bagels and bread is amazing and so maby things on the menu are great. Try the chicken scoop salad or TBLT!  Great staff too, very friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"Love to try new places everyday for lunch.  JJ's is an excellent find! Like a genuine NY/NJ deli.  Top notch food and large servings.  Had the pastrami Reuben and side of pasta salad.  It was huge and ingredients were superb. I'll definitely be back for breakfast, with all the omelets they offer, plus make their own bagels."}
{"text":"Good food but the owners are asses. The husband and wife are both very rude. Good over priced food tho."}
{"text":"JJs is a true deli, and the food is of excellent quality. The friendly service is even better!    Roger and staff always do a terrific job :)"}
{"text":"Place is amazing.  The service for a fast-casual style brunch is amazing.  I had a dog with me and one of the employees or owner, not sure which, offered to watch my dog outside while I ordered.  The food is awesome too!  There is tons to choose from and the place is always packed."}
{"text":"Tried JJ's bagels twice.  Liked them very much.  Actually liked them better than Kashmans.   They had a nice firmness to the outside and a bit chewy like I like them.  I still prefer the size of  a New York bagel to these, but they had good texture.  I thought the staff was very friendly, especially one of the male employees in the morning.  Don't know his name but he met me at the door w/ quite a greeting and  also said goodbye when I left.  Big smile.  I felt like he enjoyed this place and that goes a long way.  I'll have to come back to see how they make a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Serves breakfast til closing time! I love breakfast and it's nice to have a place that serves it through the lunch hour. butter fields was my fav until I tried this place. The pancakes are Amazing! Large, fluffy, with a really smooth tasting batter. They have very unique breakfast potatoes. They must make them on the premises because they look like fresh cut red potatoes and they make them seasoned and kind of crispy. Def going to become one of my regular breakfast joints. Guys at the counter were really nice too:)"}
{"text":"Not a good place. The lady who took my order was rude, screwed it up.  Then remade the food wrong again.  Not trying to make the customer happy.  Didn't offer to make me something else or give money back. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place two times and both visits have been good.  The staff was nice and the orders were correct (got carryout). I got the breakfast bagel sandwich the first time and the greek omelet the next time. Both items were fresh and tasty, and my husband's breakfast burrito was really good! They have awesome breakfast potatoes as well. If you are looking for a good local spot to run in and grab breakfast or lunch this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Forgive me for being gross, but I have to tell you my favorite way to judge a Jewish-style deli. It's by how much you enjoy the post-meal burps. And the new JJ's Delicatessen at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road rates high on the burp-o-meter!! It's been open since July in the spot once occupied by Kashman's. In my opinion, JJ's is much better. The service is lovely (a big change), the menu extensive, and the food delicious.       I ordered the signature sandwich, a \"Pnish\" ($8.95). It's a \"square potato knish sliced in half and filled with your favorite meat, cheese and dressing, then grilled panini style\". I chose corned beef, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. For my included-in-the-price side, I got cole slaw. In general I'm not a great fan of knishes, but this one did make a great (and unusual) sandwich. The corned beef was a tad dry, but with Russian dressing and cole slaw, who'd notice? The cole slaw was fabulous; I appreciated its sweetness, and Ken its sourness. We both loved the freshness. All the salads are made daily. As are the breads and bagels. Ken had a cinnamon raisin bagel, which I, of course, tried. It was more dense than most Arizona bagels, and chewy, so it reminded me somewhat of New York bagels. Ken's fruit platter was quite large, and the fruit was ripe and tasty.       All the pastry looked delicious. We took home a chocolate horn and an apricot hamantaschan. Both were shockingly good. The hamantaschan dough was melt-in-your-mouth rich, and the tart filling was a pleasant contrast. The texture of the chocolate horn was perfect, it shattered when I bit into it, yet it wasn't dry. The chocolate had a good flavor. By the way, iced coffee goes perfectly with chocolate horns, and JJ's makes theirs using a cold drip method. I had ice tea with my sandwich, and it was excellent.       We're planning to try breakfast at JJ's. There's a huge variety of options including a L.E.O.($9.95), matzo brie ($8.95), and a whitefish salad platter ($10.95). Latkes and blintzes are both available at $10.95. Not cheap, but I bet there'd be enough to share. Coffee comes in many forms: cappucino, latte, macchiato, etc. And more pastry.       As we were getting ready to leave I experienced my first JJ's burp. I got into the car with a big smile on my face."}
{"text":"This place gets it. You greeted with a smile. Helped with your order selection. Many options so usually just describe what I want. Good hot coffee. Check back with me to see if I need anything. Meals are delicious and generous."}
{"text":"My go-to for chicken noodle or matzo ball soup when anyone I know is under the weather. Taste just like mom made."}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good, and super friendly service. I had a Reuben and loved it."}
{"text":"Incredible delicatessen! Staff is super friendly and engaging, and the overall service was exceptional. Menu is endless with countless options and variations. Everything can be made to order and the food was tasty, and every part of the meal was enjoyable (including the well priced, generous portions). Super great, lively atmosphere, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"On the days when I want my deli breakfast fix, I don't even consider going to work without hitting JJs first.  Baglewhich with scrambled eggs, bacon, american cheese on a Pumpernickel bagel!!! you haven't lived until you've had it.  Do it now, do it for all of humanity."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot since it was Kashman's and have always loved the great food and the employees. I could always rely on this place for a delicious breakfast/lunch and friendly customer service, but the new boss of this place is disappointing. Incredibly rude and arrogant. However I appreciate the employees too much to ever stop coming here."}
{"text":"The owners of this great little spot are so wonderful, the food is great and the atmosphere is perfect. If you are ever looking for a great breakfast spot in North Scottsdale JJ's is the place"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito! Cold brew coffee is also really great. Hubby ordered the George breakfast burrito and I built my own with eggs, cheddar cheese, avocado and jalapeños. Simply amazing. We are staying at the JW Marriott and this morning breakfast beats last nights dinner at Roy's! By a lot!"}
{"text":"I'm a new AZ resident and have eaten at JJ's twice over the past couple weeks. The staff is friendly and the food has been delicious! I've tried the avocado and mandarin salad as well as the chicken salad on a wheat wrap. The food is fresh and they have plenty of healthy options. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"JJ's is not the cheapest place in town, but you will not be disappointed with the vast menu, taste or portion size. And, the staff is friendly and helpful -- imagine! If you have kids and they love pancakes, they'll love JJ's pancakes."}
{"text":"Over priced sandwiches. Just because it's north Scottsdale doesn't mean everyone should pay out the rear for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! They have the best pancakes and breakfast burritos ever!! And the staff is so friendly every time I am there! I always recommend this place for a tasty breakfast :)"}
{"text":"This is an awesome NY style deli with a large selection of salads as well as traditional deli food! I had the Turkey Burger- it was delicious! Owner is around and sees to it that everyone is happy!"}
{"text":"Grear service and terrific food.  Been coming here for a couple of years with our hiking group.  Always served promptly and they can handle a group nicely beyond a couple or two.  Heartedly recommend for wonderful deli whether you are by yourself or a group of 15.  If a group call abead and they will set up a reserved table."}
{"text":"Great NY Style Deli in Scottsdale, AZ.  Do I need to say anything more?  The bagels are truly great and the service is very friendly and fast.  So happy to have found these guys on a whim."}
{"text":"We love the JJs experience. Roger, the owner, is fully engaged in the business and the customer service is perfect. Best patio and dog friendly"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Deli in the Phoenix area. I've been to nearly every Deli and nothing compares. The food, service, and value is incredible. In addition, the owner Roger, works right along with his help. He treats everyone with respect and the service relects it. A very friendly guy. Give JJ's a try, you won't be sorry. I had the Turkey Reuben and my wife and friend had corned beef sandwiches. They were to die for!"}
{"text":"As if their breakfast dishes weren't already amazing, they go and have some of the friendliest service! I'd recommend...just about anything!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place. We were regular Sunday morning visitors. The place is named after their two sons. The oldest son was super nice and recognized us and we talked about school life etc. He went off to school and then the son steps up and acts like its a bother for you to be there. Last time and the straw on the camels back was he never said one word to us while ordering. He never made eye contact and rolled his eyes several times. When it came to paying, he just pointed at the total. Have him a credit card and then he walked away. We had guests with us and they were somebody should report him. I said he's the owners son, they don't care. So we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Really a quality deli with an extensive menu. Slightly overpriced but service was good and quick and really friendly. Food was delicious good coffee great spot."}
{"text":"By far the best deli in Arizona! This place has retained the same employees for 15 years. Clean,friendly, and rapid service, with very generous portions.., The pastry, bagels, and sandwiches are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great find in the area. Love the deli meat and excellent breakfast spread. Diverse bagel selection and cream cheese. Service was attentive and fast. Dog friendly patio. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Having been in the Deli business, I can honestly say, JJ's Delicatessen has the perfect mix of great food, clean environment and AWESOME personality!  Great job, Roger!  You have trained a great team!  So glad I live in the neighborhood!  Favorite breakfast spot with my 4 legged forever friends aka pups!"}
{"text":"I noticed that Kashman's went out of business and JJ's Deli took over.  I had to experience this new deli for myself.  I just ate my second meal there just to make sure it was truly as good as my first visit.  The service and attitude of the owner Roger, his family and employees was top notch.  They are genuine, sincere, authentically warm and strive to provide the highest level of service without jeopardizing food quality.  I ate the corned beef sandwich with coleslaw and swiss which was awesome. The meat like Michael H. reviewed was lean and delicious.  Yesterday, had the Chinese chicken salad and the dressing was spicy and killer.  Fresh and cool. Just the way I love it.  Since I had a big appetite I also engaged in a warm buffalo chicken sandwich which was amazing.  I kid you not... you will see me frequenting this place consistently.  See you at JJ's soon and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to JJ's today for the first time since it opened.  Overall, I felt it was the same thing as Kashman's with a few minor additions to the menu including some tasty looking Jewish baked goods.  My Husband got the corn beef omelet, which he had before when it was Kashman's with no changes.  I got the Pnish, which I was excited for, but when it came it was cold and they put the wrong meat in it and forgot my mustard.  So, all in all, the place was a good as Kashman's but I wasn't please with what I got.  We'll go back again because I love sitting outside on the weekends at this cozy place."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family owned restaurant with amazing service. Bagels are the best! Both the breakfast and lunch menus are extensive and the kitchen is very willing to make any dietary exceptions you have."}
{"text":"Wow! Such great food and the welcome when you come in was really one of a kind. We had a rueben, a Monte Cristo and a rueben with gluten free bread.  All were delicious! And the cole slaw was awesome too"}
{"text":"I took my son for a breakfast treat this weekend, and the experience was even better than the first visit!  Everyone who works there seems to want to be there, and not to mention- THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC!  Aside from the limited seating area (which shows the popularity of this place), the atmosphere, staff and food are an absolute delight!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am very happy that I have found some decent non chain restaurants up in North Scottsdale! JJ's is a great Deli!  I ordered the Tuna Sandwich and got a side of Cucumber salad.  My coworker got the Dave's Bagelwich.   My sandwich was delicious!!! My only disappointment was the size of the side. 3 bites and it was gone - would probably be 2 for males.   Coworker loved her bagel sandwich.   I do wish they had half sours, but oh well.   I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rene made our experience in eating at JJ's worthwhile. His service was imperial and everything he was pleasing the customer. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast this morning at JJ's...  I have been here a couple times on the weekend for a lunch sandwich but this was my first attempt at breakfast.  The breakfast menu is large  (possibly larger than lunch items) with something to appeal to most anyone's tastes.  I loved the Greek omelet - one of the best I have had!    The staff here are friendly and accommodating.  I have been trying to limit my carb intake so asked for sliced tomatoes instead of potatoes and they ran down a long list of other side options.  No ups or extra costs for the substitution.   This is a nice spot for lunch and now I will definitely be adding them to my breakfast  rotation."}
{"text":"I have to reiterate what others have said; the breakfast here is incredible. Customer service top notch, fantastic servings of fresh, well prepared meals, lovely choice of sweet side plates, a friendly atmosphere which caters to dog owners and bikers, I could go on and on listing the virtues of this place. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast dining experience for me.  I had George's Chorizo breakfast burrito.  It was by far the best chorizo in the state.  The portion was grand and came with a side of fruit.  The cleanliness of the establishment was impeccable, and the service easily convinced me to hit that 5th star; I was immediately acknowledged and greeted by all staff with a smile.  There menu had a large variety of items which could accommodate all breakfast and lunch cravings.  Let's not forget about the iced coffee, boy was that good too.  I for sure will be making my way back for seconds here in the near future.  To JJ's, thanks for a wonderful dining experience; for I love these mom and pop deli's."}
{"text":"Just really good sandwiches that leave you feeling guilty you ate the whole sandwich!  I mostly get the Reuben because it is my weakness.  It is juicy and tasty meat on nice bread."}
{"text":"We love having breakfast here. Staff has always been friendly to us. Owner always comes by to say hello and make sure everything is fine. Breakfast portions are large."}
{"text":"Finally found a good deli in AZ.   Been here twice so far and both times the food and service have been top notch.  Friendly, fast and delicious.    I've had the Reuben and French Dip sandwiches and would wholeheartedly recommend both.  The german potato salad is my favorite side so far.     Plenty of indoor/outdoor seating.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"updated review after a couple of years of going there almost every week!  Simply the best place to eat in Arizona period. It is everything you would want from a true NY style deli/restaurant with a fresh and healthy update. Top quality food, bagels made on premise (TRUE NY bagles, dont know how they do it!), great services and very friendly- family owned!  You can sit inside or outside in sidewalk cafe style. A dream come true, everything you would want from a NY cafe but local."}
{"text":"Bagel expert from NY reporting that these bagels are smaller, but still a good eat. They fall somewhere below my favorite Valley place, but are worthy if your in the area. I grabbed eight at a buck apiece and they have all the trendy flavors, including cornmeal and cheddar, etc. The place is tiny, but the price of a sandwich is large. At least $10.50 for nearly every sandwich. They don't use Boars Head, nor do they make their own meat and the photos of the sandwiches look small, so they must be charging North Scottsdale prices. I mean, at least Chompie's is worth the price for what you get right? Just preference, but I would also prefer a person more representative of the cuisine or the area to take my order."}
{"text":"Great bagels, HUGE menu wth everything you can imagine from a deli. Desserts, bagels, sandwiches, etc. in a strip mall-packed when we got there which was a good sign."}
{"text":"I thought this looked good judging by the people sitting outside eating. Door was propped open so I went in to order and was informed they were closed. I walked in at 301, and they apparently closed at 3. If you're going to stay open to let people finish eating what's the trouble in making a sandwich to go instead of just standing there? Great customer service...won't even give this place a shot now."}
{"text":"The menu is huge so there is definitely something for everyone for breakfast or lunch... About 7 tables inside and plenty of outside seating... Enjoyed both breakfast and lunch here.... Can't miss this gem"}
{"text":"My kids said I had to give JJ's 5 stars, they loved it. Huge portions, all delicious and worth sharing!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love JJ's!!  We've been here a few times and will definitely be found here many more mornings to come!   The staff is charming in the friendly way that makes you want to eat here every morning!  The food is pretty decent too. I always order an Iced Vanilla Latte to start off with. I don't know what it is but I can't seem to try anything else because it's so yummy!  The Denver omelette is my fav... it's always filled with a good amount of 'stuffings'. They put the cheese on the top too- which is the way I like it, otherwise I feel like I'm just eating a pound of cheese if it's mixed in like other places. It comes with toast or a bagel and a side. So of course I get a bagel for the bf  to enjoy with his meal and fruit for myself. By the way, the bagels are sooo soft and chewy. We probably won't be going back to Einstein's anytime soon.  The sandwiches are so yummy too! They all taste so fresh. The bread seems like it just came out of the oven, meat just sliced and lettuce just cut! Although, my one dislike is I think the chicken salad is a bit on the sweet side.  It tends to be on the pricey side but for the amount, service and quality you receive I don't mind paying a few extra dollars!"}
{"text":"I work near by here (within walking distance) and always place orders to go! This place always serves up the best food! When they say it will be ready in ten minutes, they mean it! Time is valuable and they treat you with such respect and really make you feel valued. Definitely make this a spot to stop off at!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Heard about it in So Scottsdale Mag and tried the Challah french toast stuffed with cream cheese....amazing.  My husband had an omlet and the potatoes were also great....a must try for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff here are excellent, very helpful and nice.  I had an omelette that was loaded with great, fresh ingredients.  The side of fruit was fresh and ripe, and the bagel was amazing.  Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"This is a great little deli.  Food is consistent and tasty.  The service is efficient and helpful.  A great neighborhood go to with plenty of patio seating (as well as inside) and people watching, my favorite pastime :)."}
{"text":"Excellent find, JJ,s is located at the NE corner of Scottsdale/Pinnacle Peak Rds.  There is easy parking.  You will notice approximately 30 outdoor tables with umbrellas and another 10 inside, dog friendly.   They have a container of dog treats for their 4 legged guests.    JJs is open for breakfast to 3:00 everyday.  The menu is vast, fortunately they have paper menu that is easy to read.  So many options.  Breakfast, breads, bagels and muffins baked fresh daily.   Menu covers breakfast, hot/cold sandwiches, salads galore and soup.  If you are a coffee drinker they have a lot of varieties including iced. We saw a lot of customers ordering them.   I ordered the Monte Cristo and fellow dinner got a custom pastami with a side of fruit.   Both enjoyed  our sandwiches.   We split a walnut brownie, very delicious.     The service was friendly and helpful.   With the temps getting cooler, I look forward to my next visit and enjoying the Fall weather.  Highly recommend you give JJs a try"}
{"text":"Went here with my brother when he was visiting. We both agreed that the service here is very good and the food is incredible. I highly recommend going here. The only downside is that they do not serve booze."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stop for a good quick breakfast and/or lunch! Their food is always fresh and their service is always on point and delivers with a smile!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  All the breakfast is good, especially the lox platter and the eggs w hash.  Great iced tea too.  True deli, good deli food."}
{"text":"Dare I say it and commit heresy?  Yes!  JJ's is better than Kashman's was.  Which is a high compliment indeed."}
{"text":"BEST TUNA SANDWICH IN THE WORLD. A stretch - you say? That's because you haven't tried it.  I order mine on sourdough bread, lightly toasted, with a chocolate milk (homemade, creamy and scary-good) or Seattle's Best Coffee.  Note: This morning I failed to mention \"lightly\" toasted, so the bread was toasted-toasted and shredded allllllll the skin in my mouth on the way down. Still tasty, but worth noting.   All of the other bites of food I've stolen off my boyfriend's plate are pretty good too .. more classic type breakfast, nothing fancy. He does always order a bagel though because they are made fresh in-house and the seasonings are all the way around the bagel not just on top - crucial.   They also have a frequent buyers stamp card, which is good for us because we are there all the time it seems.  Anyways, that's all. Eat the tuna - Tom's Terrific Tuna is it's official title. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an afternoon breakfast.  We each had the scramble.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  I had a bagel and fruit for sides.  My husband had potatoes and sourdough toast.  The rye bagel was excellent.  The fruit was standard Sysco.  The potatoes not so great.  The toast was excellent.  If in the area, a good breakfast stop.  Of note, the bagels to go are delicious."}
{"text":"Two Perfect lox platters this morning with excellent sesame bagels toasted perfectly, served with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, creamy cream cheese, and plenty of thinly sliced onions.    There were even enough capers for my hubby (who adores those little salt bombs)!       Friendly help ( even the busses) anxious to answer questions... next time I think I'll have a knish which looked really decadent and yummy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the basis of the positive reviews. The food was great (we had a monte cristo, a tuna sandwich, eggs and a hot dog) good sized portions and excellent flavor. My beef with this place was the service. I really felt as though I was an inconvenience. I stood at the cash register to order - for what seemed like hours. I did the whole step in closer, clear my throat and shuffle papers around routine to try to get noticed. I was eventually helped but the service was poor. He was mumbling and I couldn't understand him and was getting annoyed when I asked for things to be repeated. He couldn't even bother to hand me my cups - just sat them on the cash register base. He sat down 3 cups and I had ordered 4 drinks. Went back to inquire about my 4th drink and he just pointed to the drink case. I guessed my 4th drink was in there.   There was a bright spot - an older gentleman who greeted us, brought us a high chair and bused the tables. He was uber friendly, helpful and the only redeeming human interaction we had while here. Give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"Their omelets are phenomenal!!! I highly recommend them... The eggs and ingredients are always so fresh and delicious! And the potatoes are Mmm -- so good!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Halloween, Gotta say I wasn't really expecting a whole lot. It was late and near closing but the guys there were still pretty upbeat.   The place has a few posters on the wall and they were pretty amusing. It was clean and neat.   We got the food to go but I overheard someone saying to another customer that if they wanted a pickle they would deliver for em, that's what they do. I like that! I run a restaurant and know the value of customer service that was a big +1  I got a basic Roast beef; just tom, mayo, lettuce, and meat on the fresh baked bread. Got back and it was like back east. The shredded lettuce I was used to growing up. The chewy bread and rare beef.   I have to say it was all well worth the like 5 bucks it cost. The chips are good too. crunchy like kettle cooked and not overly salty.  I would recommend this over subway ANY day of the week. There's no such thing as perfect so Ill give this my highest review of 4/5"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sunday morning spot for breakfast or lunch. Pet friendly patio, we always take our 2 little pups with us and they love it too. Lupe is the best, he always greets us, and is just a great welcoming star for this deli. Great outside patio eating! Food is pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  I had not been back to the former Kashman's because I didn't care for it before.  I think the service and food is much better now.  We went there with the twins and requested a couple of scramble eggs for them to be done first.  They did so and were very accommodating.  I had the pancakes, remember to request the real maple syrup. They were delicious, and an huge portion, I shared some with the twins and my husband and still couldn't finish it.  My husband had the breakfast burrito, it was very good.  He ask to add potato to it and they did so.  The pastries look so good, we'll have to try them next time. We will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough great things about this place.  JJ's is the best family owned restaurant in my area hands down.  My husband and I come here almost every week.  Great food and amazing service.  They are so friendly, and it is truly family run with the owner always walking around, often times his mom working the counter along with his sons.  Not to mention, they have a large patio space and the guy who always seats us is so nice, friendly, and always makes sure you have everything you need.  They really get to know their customers and make sure everything is the best possible quality."}
{"text":"I have finally found a legit NYC style jewish deli. I've tried all the other options in Phoenix and been extremely disappointed, like have these people never been to NYC? Have they never had a proper pastrami sandwich? Apparently not.  JJ's does a killer pastrami sandwich, either a build your own or rueben. I could take or leave the sides that come with it but when the pastrami is on point who cares. I've also tried the mazto ball soup which is very good. They have knishes and other baked delights that I plan on sampling as well.  If you are looking for an actual NYC style deli with traditional jewish treats, look no farther than JJ's!"}
{"text":"The choices for good breakfast in north Scottsdale are limited and JJ's was always one of the better places. The portions were large and tasty. My last few trips have been less than expected. We went for lunch. My friend ordered chicken salad sandwich. They brought her the cranberry turkey... They asked if she knew what she had ordered and replaced the dish. The chicken salad when it arrived had pieces of broken toothpick in it. She swallowed one and we pulled out 6 more.  I ordered the roast beef on multi grain. There was about 4oz of well done roast beef on stale bread. The sandwich is served w 1000 island dressing on it- except for the discoloration on a small spot of 1/2 of the sandwich, I wouldn't know it was there  Bottom line- I expect more from a Jewish deli.  Roast beef served med rare and lots of it for $11. Fresh baked bread - at least fresh bread. And enough service that we could have turned down a to go box and turned in the toothpicks.   This used to be a wonderful place. Not sure where it fell off the tracks. But I won't likely return."}
{"text":"Finally tried JJ's after living in Scottsdale for a year.... and I'm mad I didn't come sooner! You guys this place is the BOMB. If you can't decide on breakfast or lunch or a deli sandwich or a bagel like my fiancé and I never can (we like options haha) this place is the perfect place to go to where ALL will be delicious! It has a great outdoor patio area that's always busy around lunch time. You order at the front and the menu is HUGE! you can either dine in or take out. We chose to dine in so they gave us a number and we sat where we wanted. It's a bit tiny inside but we had no problem finding a table. I ordered the CBLT club sandwich on a roll and added deli mustard onions and took some of the bread out to make room! Every order comes with your choice of a variety of sides so I ordered a pasta salad. I also got a pickle. My fiancé wanted breakfast so he ordered the denver omelette with potatoes and a jalapeño bagel. You guys, it was all so amazing. The ingredients were fresh and had a great taste. The portions were perfect. The potatoes were seasoned and crispy--not soggy. The bagel was my favorite part-I think next time I'm going to order my sandwich on a bagel!  The service was incredible. Right when we walked in the staff was friendly and very attentive. Everyone greeted us and took care of us very well. I am absolutely impressed with this place and can't wait to bring my family and friends! I heard they are opening for dinner now too, which is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for lunch this past weekend and I was shocked to see how much they had on their menu! I was totally excited when I saw the Reuben sandwich. It was AWESOME!!!!! Exactly how a Reuben sandwich should taste. Husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich but we had to send it back because the chicken was overcooked and very tough. The person who helped us said they would cook up a fresh batch and when we got the sandwich back it was awesome. Just a small hiccup but they totally took care of us.  $11 seems to be the going price per lunch order but the lunches are big and you can share them.  Super busy so come early for a table, that's for sure. We lucked out and got indoor seating.  We will be back for sure when we're craving a good ol' sandwich."}
{"text":"Love love this place ! Right next to my work. They have TOP NOTCH omelets and skillets ! Everything is homemade! Customer service is great as well! Make sure to get here early because it gets packed and hard to find a table !"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for animal lovers as they have outdoor seating. Love to meet up with the family there on the weekends because they can accommodate large groups outside. We have an exceptionally friendly and accommodating staff inside and out. Have been there several times and never had a bad meal they make their own bagels! My favorite is the veggie omelette. Everything fresh. I also have had the chicken salad on a bagel pname freshly made with almonds and raisins easy parking on the side of the buildings."}
{"text":"Great deli.  Probably the best around.  Also one of the best reubens I've ever had.  Awesome bread (homemade I think) and tender corned beef; the stuff dreams are made of.  The only downside of this place is that the staff is overly friendly.  Like borderline annoying.  It was like being in Mexico when the locals try to usher you into a pharmacia or some other tourist trap.  I guess it doesn't matter though because I want to go back asap.  That reuben was just as addicting as whatever is in those Mexican pharmacias."}
{"text":"Worst. They are rude and awful people. The owner is a giant douche and seems to hate the world as a result."}
{"text":"A girlfriend introduced me to JJ's, and we've made it a point to share the Cobb Salad and the Santa Fe Grilled Chicken sandwich for our monthly get-togethers.  DELISH"}
{"text":"This used to be Kashman's deli and I loved Kashman's so walking in there I had high expectations.  Unfortunately it wasn't what I had hoped, the bagels were $3.00 but good and the Challah French Toast was not bad either!  My omelette was decent but how good can an omelette be?  It just did not have that homey feel that I was used to but overall okay place!"}
{"text":"Great deli - best I've had since my last trip to NYC. Try the P'nish - a sandwich using a knish as the bread is excellent. Had mine with turkey, swiss, thousand island and cole slaw. Classic yet innovative.   I understand that bagels are made the right way - boiled then baked - just like in the old country. Better than Chompies. If you're from Tucson and remember the Hot Bagel Bakery on Speedway - JJ's bagels are as good as those were.   You can't miss the owner, Roger, when you walk in - I don't know that anyone has ever seemed so happy to see me patronize a restaurant as Roger did. Really made me feel welcome.   Only open breakfast and lunch - no dinner. Great patio seating with lots of umbrellas & dog friendly (I didn't know that last time - I'll have to bring my basset next time).   Highly recommend JJ's as possibly the best deli in the Phx area."}
{"text":"What a find! Had the Santa Fe chicken sandwich, and it was amazing. Perfect bread, chew and seasoning. Worth the find, come and enjoy this place when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food - I'm addicted to their breakfast bagels. JJ's starts with a fresh and spongy bagel and piles on their ridiculously fluffy eggs. I usually add sausage or turkey sausage if I'm watching my girlish figure. Then they smother on cheese to hold it all together. I can't always finish it all in one sitting, but it's too good to not try.  Note: They only have one size coffee, 20oz. I usually don't need that much, but for the coffee drinkers out there, it should hold you over.  For lunch, I tried their pastrami on rye with slaw. THANK YOU JJ's for staying true to the deli values of loading ungodly amounts of meat on every sandwich. This thing was piled so high it needed the toothpick to hold it all together. Absolutely delicious and I can't wait to try others.  Service - The staff is great. They always greet me personally and called me by name after only going once. Very sincere, genuinely nice people and seem to always be looking out for you. I overheard someone complaining that they were given the wrong sandwich. It was such a slight variation that they didn't even ask for a replacement. Still, the staff brought them out the new sandwich and comp'd them drinks!  Price - My one beef is that they do run on the pricier side. A full breakfast bagel and coffee is going to put you around 9 bucks and the lunch is going to be over 10. I'm cheap, so that might not be bad for folks who frequent this area. Though, it's tough to get upset when the food is so good and you get a ton.  Authenticity - Two cars rocking New York plates sitting out front! Legit."}
{"text":"I came here to try the delicatessen food and that is what my rating is on. On a positive note this place is in a nice location with a pleasant dog friendly patio. The inside is nice and bright. You don't have table service as you order at the counter, seat yourself, and they run the food to you.  I soon received my lox platter. The cucumbers, onions and tomatoes were nice and fresh cut. I took half the bagel and spread the cream cheese on it and noticed that the cream cheese was very thin and seemed like it was whipped and then thinned  down. I tasted it and it lacked the tang that cream cheese needs. NOBODY ANYWHERE thins down cream cheese and it was terrible. The bagel was fresh but very odd to me because of it's texture. It lacked the chewiness and yeast-ty-ness that a bagel normally has. But the MOST DISAPPOINTING thing about this platter was the lox. I wasn't sure at first if it was the lack of quality or the lack of freshness about the taste. It actually was fishy tasting with lots of salt. After maybe three bites I think it was both issues and didn't eat the rest. This was the worst lox and cream cheese I ever tried anywhere.  We also tried a potato knish. The first thing I noticed was the knish was very untraditional in appearance and was wrapped in puff pastry instead of the normal knish dough. The filling had the texture of instant potatoes and lacked the onion flavor and taste the filling normally has. The puff pastry was gooey in areas see photo.  We also had DRY but fatty pastrami on fluffy mild thick rye bread. The pastrami would have been good if it was prepared properly as it seemed mishandled like someone just fried it instead of braising it for maybe two more hours with some onions to make it tender and juicy. The fluffy that lacked sour rye bread just was a sponge for the oily fatty dry pastrami.  Lastly it was obvious that the potato salad was home made because the flavoring was    a combination of unbalanced spices and too much mustard. Only someone without taste buds would be able to choke the stuff down.  I was WRONG not to complain about the lox but my head was just spinning about everything.  Old tasting lox weird texture bagel WATERED Down cream cheese not good gooey knish almost hard dry pastrami inedible potato salad  Nobody asked us how things were and I didn't feel like walking back in with my dogs and telling them.   I would be understanding if a relative or neighbor prepared food like this but I expect at least passable quality at a restaurant. I do feel terrible about giving a small business only one star but the truth is wild horses can't drag me back to eat here again.  Oy Vay!  Usually deli food is very filling but here you can leave hungry."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of JJ's Deli - it reminds me of the type of place that I would frequent when I lived back in NY :)    The staff here is awesome... when you come here for a while it becomes kind of like a Cheers... where EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME!  They are usually very punctual, which is important with my schedule... when I call in an order it is almost always ready on time.  Over the years I can only think of a few occasions where an order wasn't perfect...  A few of my favorites are their Turkey Burger... I love this with cheese + grilled onions + grilled peppers ... amazing!  I also love their Greek Omlette, which I typically get with Egg Whites and the JJ's Potatoes (JJ's are nearly as awesome as my moms homemade potatoes!).  This place has a lot of awesome sandwiches, and it is quite challenging to find a NY style deli in AZ!!  I only wish JJ's stayed open later, so that I could order the goodies into the evening hours... but overall I would highly recommend this establishment and if they ever extended their business hours I would come here even more regularly!  The store is nothing too fancy, but most NY Deli's are not known to be glamorous because it's all about the FOOD!  The prices here are fairly reasonable for North Scottsdale and the service and food quality is consistently on point for the most part!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite small local business! Everything is so yummy, and everyone is extremely sweet and goes above and beyond to ensure the best service! Truly a 5 Star place!"}
{"text":"First of all, anyone who complains about Roger should have their teeth kicked in! The man is a Saint! And for the cheapskate who complained about \"lunch for two with drinks $25.00\" ..please go to Subway..you belong there. At JJ's everyone is cool, food is great, service outstanding...glad they're here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! 30 different types of bagels? Breakfast all day? Sign me up! All I can say about this place is that it's amazing AND dog friendly! I've been here 3 times in the last month and I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Just tried JJs for the first time- greeted with a very warm welcome when we entered- food was fast and good. Quite the selection of entrees. We will definitely be coming back. I have yet to find something like JJs in north Scottsdale so this was a neat experience."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of JJ's great people, great food!Their salt bagels are my absolute favorite. It's such a cute local restaurant, with a fun environment."}
{"text":"Great breakfast bagel sandwich. Menu is vast and they have knish! Staff is extremely friendly and quick. Seattle's best coffee as well as assorted bottles and cans of soda and juice. They have fountain soda as well."}
{"text":"Dang, this was one of the best breakfasts I have had in a while! My parents live right near this place, don't know why I hadn't tried it sooner, I have been missing out. They have such a wide variety which is awesome. Also impressed that they have more than one vegetarian option. The environment was welcoming, its a nice little place, almost everyone was sitting outside. JJ's is a good place to eat in spring or fall for that reason! Not much indoor seating. I ordered a build your own skillet. Thought it was pretty generous that you could pick up to 5 meats/cheeses/vegetables to add to the skillet for no extra charge. For most places you only get to pick 2 or 3! For my skillet I got tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, spinach, and feta with the eggs scrambled. It was so incredible. Always disappointing when a breakfast place has sub par potatoes, but these were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Also came with toast or a bagel and cream cheese. I went for a salt bagel (a childhood favorite. They make all of their own bagels there and they are very good. They are not super big though. Very good quality though, soft and tasty. My friend also got a skillet with an egg bagel and he enjoyed it.  JJ's was a good find, I seriously cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Heard about JJ's for a few years now and finally decided to go there a couple of weeks ago.  First thing that impressed me was the service  and friendly staff that made you feel like family.  The food was great and I've been there three times now in the past couple of weeks.  PS.  Lupe, you rock!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a patty melt with a side of German potato salad. The flavors were amazing, and the serving size was more than enough! It also came with a pickle wedge. We ordered by phone and the food was ready when we arrived. They have a beautiful glass display filled with desserts. I asked if I could add on a rugelach, and they did so without hesitation. Such sweet customer service with a friendly smile. I will definitely be going back here again! Bonus is that it's only a couple miles from my office. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The best food AND employees out there. How can you can not love JJs for breakfast and lunch. The only complaint is there are too many fabulous menu choices for me!!  Xoxo"}
{"text":"Badda bing badda bang.  It's 87 degrees and it's time for lunch.  I wasn't in the mood for something heavy since it was only getting hotter. Oh yeah a Jewish deli sounded good.  Can't go wrong here. This place is clean and service is super friendly. I grabbed a menu and it took me about 15 minutes to decide what I wanted.   I finally went for the standard Rueben with corned beef, sauerkraut, mustard and swiss on toasted rye bead. Instead of potato salad I asked for fried seasoned potatoes. My hubby ordered the bagel and lox.  One of my kids orded the stuffed tomato with tuna and my other kid ordered a stuffed challah toast. Ohhhh..and don't forget the milkshakes. It think it took about 5 minutes and our food was already being served. Wow..talk about fast.  Did I mention the servers were so friendly and on the ball? Oh yeah... I did... but seriously, those guys were awesome!  All of the food looked and tasted wonderful.  We were able to sit outside and have our dog with us since it was a pet friendly area.  We also grabbed a few rugelach to go.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Green peppers and onions in omelette uncooked (after ageeing to saute more than usual)  skimpy on cheese, barely there. Capuccino poorly made."}
{"text":"JJ's is my favorite nearby lunch spot. Their sandwiches are delicious (I'm partial to Brenda's Veggie) and the service is impressive. Everyone is friendly and they are incredibly quick. I can't say enough about what a great, locally owned place this is. I'm so glad they're around!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It really feels like a neighborhood deli - the family owned atmosphere, the patio seating, the suuuper friendly staff, and the quality food. Plus, The variety of food options is incredible. It's so hard to decide! I got the bagel (well, flagel) and lox and hubby got the stuffed challah French toast (YUM!). Can't wait to come back with our dog and hang on the patio again soon!"}
{"text":"My boys and I love coming here after Church. Something for everyone.  Today- Amazing Chocolate Chip Bagel for my youngest, Carne Asada Burrito for the oldest, and an amazing Wild Berry and Goat Cheese Salad for Mom!  Everyone seems to get something different every time.  Super pancakes, over a dozen amazing salads, hot and cold sandwiches, a dozen brunch favorites- omelets, Huevos Rancheros!  Yum yum yum... causal brunch lunch heaven for kids and parents and grandparents alike.  Everyone walks away super happy!!! Thank you JJ's!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The coffee is fabulous and the omelettes are the best (reminds me of NYC). The kids meals are great too. My son loves the Belgian waffle with fresh fruit and whipped cream. Definitely a must when it comes to breakfast."}
{"text":"Great spot. Friendly people. I had a lox platter with a yummy flagel and my dad had the same. I definitely will be back to try an omelette and their salads look awesome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here a few times. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The menu is giant. The restaurant is clean. The food is tasty. Bagels galore, yes, but there are sit down options like burritos and omelets as well! Plus there's lunch too, but I haven't tried anything for lunch. I love breakfast, so I love that I can get a full breakfast menu at lunch time . . . . Particularly on a lazy Saturday when I don't want to be up and ready before lunch or wait any hour at the popular brunch spots in town. This place is on my list!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place, but delis always end up being mediocre. This place is far from mediocre! I love the huge variety of sandwiches & salads. They also have tons of delicious desserts. I got a bagel sandwich which came with scrambled egg, cheese, and I added bacon. Definitely was so fresh. The kids meal had came with one egg, meat, and side choice which we got fruit. Huge portion for such a great price! Can't wait to come back and try out more."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was known as Kashman's! Some of the same guys still work there and they are as friendly as ever. Nothing has changed much except some of the wall decor and the name. The food is always great, the staff is warm and happy to be there, and even the customers are happy and welcoming! Always a great place to catch breakfast with friends."}
{"text":"Great place!!  Blows chompies out of the water. Been coming here since it opened.  Employees know all the regulars. Owner is usually present ensuring great service and quality food."}
{"text":"After my first visit, I fell in love with JJ's Delicatessen.  Everything is made-to-order with quality ingredients.  My boyfriend and I stopped by one Sunday morning for some breakfast.  Everything on the expansive menu sounded delicious.  JJ's serves breakfast  (skillets, eggs, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, pastries, etc), lunch and other savory deli items (knish, challah...).   Place your order at the counter, grab some coffee and find a seat inside or on the patio.  I ordered an egg white Greek omelette with fresh fruit and a whole wheat bagel (the options included potatoes or fruit and bagel or toast).  My honey had two eggs with fruit and a side of buttermilk pancakes.   Our food arrived within minutes of finding a spot on the patio.  What impressed me most about JJ's is the quality of the food.  When ordering an egg white omelette you'd expect less eggs and more veggies than your typical \"whole-egg\" omelette.  Not so at JJ's.  The veggies were fresh and the egg whites were plentiful.  I finally found a place that caters to my health-nut tendencies without skimping on quantity or flavor.  Did I mention the buttermilk pancakes are phenomenal?  JJ himself was helping customers, busing tables and even moving in heating lamps for the chilly patron.  It was nice to have our needs met by the owner himself.  Amazing food, service and down-to-earth atmosphere.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Simply the BEST!  Unbelievable selection of food, FRIENDLY staff (love LUPE) fresh, fast and a great patio for sitting outside on a beautiful AZ morning.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place have excellent breakfast and great staffs, but unfortunately the older lady with gray hair at the cashier register was rude. We were in group of six and the menu was so confusing since they have long list menu and she didn't try to help us to make the order easier instead she was rushing us. I felt like we were bothering her or something."}
{"text":"Only the best LEO in Arizona. Consistently good. Service with a smile. Never a worry. Just great food. If you grew up in NY or south Florida, you had real deli's on every corner. Each were great.  This is the only place with consistently great food and service."}
{"text":"If you want to feel at home come to JJs. If you want just some amazing breakfast and lunch foods, come to JJs. This place is the real deal! Family owned and operated. From the moment you walk up and are greeted with a robust \"Good Morning\" from Lupe, to walking in and seeing the vast selection on the giant menu board overhead, you will be impressed. The staff including Eddie, Oscar, Freddie and many others, will always make you feel like you belong there. After one or two times, they know your name (Cue Cheers music). Not sure what you want? They will always make great recommendations. As long as you are in the Scottsdale, North Phoenix area, you must try JJs Deli! You will not be disappointed you will surely return again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burritos that are loaded with eggs/chorizo, cheese and potatoes.  The Omelets and Skillets will leave you very satisfied and full.  Great family ownership and service."}
{"text":"Had the totally most awesome breakfast here this week. I ordered the Southwest omelette, loaded with cheese and green pepperrs, and that was excellent. The potatoes were a close 2nd. I don't think I've ever had such tasty potatoes as a side.   The coffee was hot and yummy and the owner even asked me to sample some new rye bread he was considering taking on. All is all, a fantastic experience. The kids and wife and I will hit it again this weekend."}
{"text":"A July 4th visit to JJ's Deli.  My dog LOVES this place; she gets all excited when we say \"Let's go to JJ's\", \"Want to go?\".  Her favorite is two scambled egg whites on a plastic plate.  Today was a dog crazy day; almost everyone had their dog.  Thanks for continuing to make this place dog friendly; with free Milkbones.  I think you should add some \"doggie\" items (i.e. a fresh baked biscuit to your menu - you'd sell a lot.)  We go about 3 times a month. The food is good; and really improved since it was Kashman's Place.  I also think some \"upgrades\" to the side dishes - fruit and breakfast potatoes are better, but still could use some work."}
{"text":"Everytime I've gone here for lunch it's been fantastic.  The service is super friendly and the food is AWESOME!!!  With the weather as it is now it's always welcomed to eat outside in the fresh air!  The staff let me know that every morning they make their bagels fresh which is something to stow away for the early morning meetings.  I typically get the Pastrami Ruben and it's one of the best the Valley has to offer.  They are also super pet friendly which is nice for someone who doesn't want to leave their fourlegged friend while they grab a snack.  They also offer wonderful alternatives such as fresh fruit to sub out for chips and the Matsa Ball soup is RAD!!!"}
{"text":"We went to JJ's Deli because they offer a pet friendly patio.  This was a nice clean out door area with many tables.  This is the kind of place where you go up to the counter to place your order and then they bring it out to you.  The bagels were fantastic and the service was nice.  We will be back, with our dogs!"}
{"text":"Yumm! I'm so excited that they serve breakfast all day!! The coffee is delish (and only one large size!) and the food that I've tried so far (fresh fruit bowl and eggs) were perfect. Great vibe and everyone is super nice."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to stop on the way back from hiking Pinnacle. Huge menu, everything from full breakfasts to bagel sandwiches, sweets to big salads. The customer service is great. Everyone that works there is polite and friendly. The prices are pretty steep, not surprising since it is North Scottsdale. But still overall a great place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy.  Good assortment of breakfast and lunch choices.  Fast service.  Ultra friendly staff.  Nice outdoor seating. Always can find a delicious pastry for post meal enjoyment."}
{"text":"Just like most NY style deli's the menu is huge so I haven't ventured much past the bagelwich since I'm usually just here for breakfast .. With that said; everythg I've tried though has always been hot, freshly prepared n tasty. The fellas/crew here are all super friendly, outgoing n make it fun to stop by."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. I think he owner JJ was the guy who made my iced coffee. Very friendly and helped adjust my coffee to taste. Clean, which is a big plus. I'm coming back to try the bagels tmrw."}
{"text":"Wonderful bagels! Fast service! Locally owned and they have so many options that is what is the hardest part is making your mind up!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY!   You'll come back.  Service is off the charts, friendly & personable.  Food is yummy and they are quick!!!!   Fun and Delicious...great combination."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends.  We enjoyed excellent service large portions, and  in-house baked bagels.  The patio seating was plentiful and relaxing."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff! Love the variety of the menu. Breakfast is terrific, I have been coming here for  Over ten years  Thanks \"JJ\""}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Jewish Deli experience, this is NOT the place. I ordered corned beef on rye and here are some comments: 1) The rye bread was cut too thick, but was not too bad for flavor. I prefer caraway seeds, but even NYC delis don't all have that in their bread. 2) The meat was clearly cut from some lump of corned beef goo like from Boar's Head which is not from brisket and lacks the texture and flavor. It was cold, and I suppose my bad, as they give you a choice, but no self respecting deli serves cold corned beef. 3) They put on the mustard which, to me, is a big no-no. I don't remember if he offered mayo but I would not have been surprised. 4) The potato salad was of the right consistency but lacked flavor. Lots of goo and color, no flavor.  All in all they need to trim back the 5000 items on their menu and do a few well. Maybe cook their own meat?   Service was good. But overall not a place I would return. I can go to the store and make a sandwich better than this for half the cost."}
{"text":"I just love JJ's.. it's the one breakfast place I genuinely crave- their onion or everything bagel with egg white, bacon and cheddar cheese just lights up my morning every time. They also have great flavored coffees- there's not a better morning than grabbing a bfast sandwich, hot coffee and sitting out on their open patio on a Sat or Sunday when weather permits. The atmosphere is laid back and friendly but with a solid crowd. They're always busy, but the service is pretty quick. These guys have breakfast figured out."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have always had good service and a tasty breakfasts. Today was no different: two scrambled eggs and hot coffee"}
{"text":"Love this place!  And the service is super.  Likely, you'll be served by the owner, his mother and/or his kids.  The patio is great. My wife and I are here frequently, and we bring friends who usually become regulars as well.  Try the breakfast burrito, pancakes or omelets."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of dropping by JJ's when I'm looking for a good sandwich. By far my favorite is the Santa Fe Grilled Chicken - it does have a very small kick to it so if you don't like any heat in your food I'd steer away! Only downside is that it's a bit pricy for a sandwich but I think the Santa Fe is worth it.   Their menu has something for everyone, as it's got plenty of options and a long list of drinks as well. What makes this place even better is the customer service - for example I ordered my food to go and after ordering I had to sit outside due to bringing my dog with me. Usually you have to head to the front to pick up your food, however they came out onto the patio and handed it to me instead. Side note, they do have a dog friendly patio!  Plus side - they have stamp cards! If you lose yours just let them know :)"}
{"text":"We went here last weekend for breakfast, and boy, has this place slid in quality.  Place looked really dirty inside, portions got smaller, prices went up, and all the experience did was make me miss Kashmans even more.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"I just moved right up the street from JJ's and had a few friends rave about t so I had to give it a chance and wow! Fantastic. From the friendliness of the entire staff (including the owner) to the delicious food (the chicken salad: perfection) to the ambiance of the deli itself with its sport's memorabilia littered about, this place is truly a hidden gem as everyone is saying. I can't wait for Sunday to roll out of bed and grab some JJ's! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at JJ's FIVE TIMES in the last 3 weeks and would go back today if I could.  They're that friendly, the menu is that diverse, and everything I've had is that good.  The first time we went, we had no idea how do \"do\" JJ's.  I guess it showed, because (I believe) the owner took us aside right away, gave us one of the printed menus by the door, told us to order at the inside register once we've decided, they give us a number to put on our table and they bring our food out to our table.  Mostly outdoor seating and lots of dogs on the patio.    The food is out of this world.  Best bagels in the area, but my favorite are the salads that are far from the usual ceasar and club (though I think they have those, too).  Especially the Harvest salad with jicama, apples, dates, raisins and a bunch of other tasty good stuff that's good for you.    Best casual breakfast or lunch in this part of town by far."}
{"text":"It's early Sunday morning, and, as I often do, I want lox. Lots of lox. In the past we went to Kashman's, but the times are a changing and JJ's Delicatessen has improved on our usual New York-style deli. To start, breath easy, because Lupe is still there, greeting you warmly as you walk in and making sure you find a seat. He's great. The menu has changed a bit, and there is a sports theme running through the menu and the decor. The new owners seem to be Mets fans, and my beau may or may not hold that against them.   We ordered  the L.E.O omelet (Lox, eggs, & onions) and the veggie skillet. They both came with a bagel and schmear, and the omelet also had a side of fruit.  Everything was freshly prepared to-order and came out quick. The staff was very accommodating when something came out wrong and quickly addressed our concerns. I greatly enjoyed the omelet - it was simple, and had the right proportion of lox to eggs. I might have peppered it up a bit more, but I like food with a kick. The veggie skillet was also very good - lots of potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cheese! You can order the skillet with any combo of veggies, meat, and cheese. Come hungry, because the skillet is a serious portion! The bagels and schmear are made in-house and are pretty good - not exactly like my favorite New York bagels, but a nice compromise. I do need to return to try the knish!  I thought the prices were a bit steep for a delicatessen, but perhaps the prices go with the portion size. Some things seemed to be priced correctly or even slightly under-priced, like the skillets that come with a bagel, or the omelets that come with a bagel and side of fruit or potato ($10 or less). Other dishes, like the lox platter seemed a bit steep ($10.95). Then again, I'm not sure how much lox come with the platter, so maybe it's not such a fishy deal after all! I'll have to investigate the other menu items and do a little more price comparison to decide.  Overall, JJ's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a great place to stop in for Sunday brunch, or any time you are craving some Jewish comfort food."}
{"text":"Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful! The turkey burger was ridiculously great with the grilled peppers and onions and a little mayo! The Suny hot wing chicken sandwich was amazing as well! They have a little different spin on the potato salad. All in all we're glad we finally made it in here for lunch and you should try it out too! Next time will be for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously over priced. They don't even have banana peppers or peppercinis to put on your sandwich. $11 for half a sandwich, please. They also charge you the same price for a whole sandwich. I have been here three times thinking I would have a better experience or feel like my meal was worth the money. I feel robbed everytime I come here. Seriously, save yourself some money and go to subway or somewhere actually worth being seriously over charged.  I will never come here again. Unless I feel like throwing away money."}
{"text":"Had an amazingly delish soup and bagel chips and my daughter had a toasted bagel with bananas. We took two cookies to go. Everything was so good and fresh. The guys behind the counter were super sweet and kind and we had a lovely experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place around. Period. They are consistent, fast, delicious and very friendly. They also are great caterers.  I would bet there is no friendlier staff in AZ."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed a quick breakfast before taking the kids to school. Pancakes are very good and they can make you just about anything! We also have them make the kids lunches when we didn't have time or materials. Make sure and just get the small (half) sandwich or they won't be hungry for dinner."}
{"text":"the best of everything here, food and service, you will love it.  You never know who you will see, yankess, hockey palyer, basketball, movie stars, etc."}
{"text":"They have the best bagels and the lox are beyond!!!    My husband had Santa Fe and LOVED IT!!  A must go!!"}
{"text":"JJ's is okay albeit a little pricey.   We wanted something quick to eat and wanted to avoid the corporate chain wasteland that is Desert Ridge so we decided on JJ's. It was our first visit since Kashman's occupied the space. Ultimately it was just like Kashman's, same food, same prices, same decor.   I had the French Dip while my partner opted for a Turkey BLT. Both were good, not the best we've ever had but pretty good.   Unfortunately by the time we were done lunch for two with two soft drinks was over $25. There are just so many other places with equally good food for less money."}
{"text":"The bagel are out of this world! Tastes like something you would get in New York. Would highly recommend. Great places to bring your gods."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I love the ice coffee and potato pancakes too! Lots of tables and outdoor seating..."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my sandwich shops and I've tried every place I can. JJ's has the best sandwiches in town in my opinion, I try to schedule my trips up north around noon so I have an excuse to eat lunch there. And the owner is the best!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fresh, fast, and fulfilling.   The guys working here greeted everyone at the door like a friend. The ingredients were premium deli offerings. We sat down after ordering and got our food almost instantaneously. Very satisfied after lunch, very pleasant outdoor seating area as well. Wish we had a place like this is Seattle!"}
{"text":"Our rep brought in lunch from JJ's to our office.  We used to always order lunch to go from Cashman's, so thought to give the new place a go.  We all liked our sandwiches that we got. I had the Ham and Brie, it was a little sodium overload, but it was good, had a fruit salad and pickle. It's not Cashman's, but it'll do. True test will be trying their bagels and eating breakfast there. To be continued..."}
{"text":"Other than Rene and Lupe who are consistently outstanding in every respect, some of the other staff are unfriendly and downright unwelcoming.  - It is really a shame that the  owners just don't get it, especially considering it is their first foray in the restaurant business...  If people who come in to your place of  business, especially a restaurant...and they feel like you are a bother...why did you get into this business to begin with. Your food is actually quite decent, but the attitude of some of the staff is awful and downright inhospitable.  I'll tell you what....Starbucks gets it -  and they are a chain! I would prefer to go to Starbucks and get a awesome experience each and every time, rather than waste my time and to support and patronize a business whose owners are incapable of the basics such as being friendly.   Its really too bad - and while some people are blind enough to like you, I have gone on with my life not feeling the need to support you any longer as you never even once showed that my business was appreciated."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous breakfast place, and excellent lunch too!  No dinner.  Tons of options, and very diverse choices. Very dog friendly with water bowls and biscuits.  Bonus- they have a punch card to earn a free meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pastrami Rubin I've had, hands down!  A great lunch spot!    Also, for breakfast, the Greek Omelet is a winner!  My wife had the Nova Lox Platter ... At $11 each, this is a very good breakfast spot!   The staff at this deli is beyond courteous, hard working and extremely eager to please.  This all adds up to an eatery that is now at the top of my list.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Scottsdale. Large menu and excellent counter service. I've even eaten here twice in one day. It's  local residents favorite."}
{"text":"The young men behind the counter were friendly and offered some suggestions when asked what they recommend. One of the recommendations they mentioned was a southwest grilled chicken sandwich, so I went with that with a cup of chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was one of the best I've ever had! Perfectly toasted, chewy sourdough bread, moist grilled chicken breast, big strips of green chile and cheese! I loved my sandwich so much, I only wish I had more! The chicken noodle soup was very good...just good, basic chicken noodle soup (served with toasted bagel chips). My husband had a Reuben sandwich, and in his words, it was \"heavenly\". The service was great too! I wanted to return to try one of the many other items on the menu, but unfortunately didn't get a chance. If I am in AZ again, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out today for me and a colleague and long story short our order got messed up. It happens, I totally understand that! What turned my experience around was the recovery, it's all about the recovery! As soon as the manager/owner recognized that I had been waiting, he got involved. Not only that, but the employees were apologetic, sincere and gave me a voucher for a free entree! Way to make what could have been a bad experience a good one! Our order wasn't 100% correct but at that point I know they were trying to just get it to me, which I appreciate! I will definitely be back, customer service like that is hard to find!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Wound up having a burger and it was great. So many great sandwich selections. Potato salad was super-fresh and delicious. Employees were helpful and super-friendly. We're bringing the hound back up to the vet across the street in a few weeks and will definitely stop in for lunch again."}
{"text":"JJs is really a nice delicatessen. The service is great the food is great and you can bring your dog here too. We love it here."}
{"text":"The best Roast Beef sandwich I've ever had. Just stumbled upon the place looking for a bite to eat.   Need to try again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and couldn't help but notice how packed this place was last weekend so we decided to give it a shot today. First off the service was excellent! Everyone who worked there was extremely nice and helpful.  Now onto the food. The bagel was really good and so was my omelet. Not my favorite breakfast potatoes ever but not bad either.  I also had a bit of my daughters waffle and that was pretty good too.  I'd highly recommend this place if you're looking for a cup of coffee and a bagel or a full blown sit down breakfast. Either way you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Just passing through and I Yelped JJ's. It had great ratings so I stopped in and had what what was recommended. Great sandwich and  full of flavor but bread was hard which some may not like."}
{"text":"Service here has really improved over the last year. When we come in these days, we receive a friendly greeting and attentive service."}
{"text":"This is our first time at JJ Deli.  Was not disappointed, tried both their breakfast and lunch items.  Food is good, and comes out hot!   Menu is huge. Give yourself time to decide what you want to order!. Employees are friendly."}
{"text":"For whatever reason it's been hard to find a decent deli since moving to Arizona. I love this place. Tons of options and all of them are wonderful. The staff is also super nice which always is a plus!"}
{"text":"Nice addition that's been around longer then I realized. My guess is breakfast is best here.  It was a good lunch. I didn't order well so hate to knock them for bad choices on my part.  Rye bread was excellent!  To me just too thick of a slice of bread for sandwich. Look forward to trying their breakfast"}
{"text":"They have very yummy lox platter. Comes with all the fixings. I usually order extra bagel because there's enough to make 2 bagel lox."}
{"text":"The best presentation, for New Years Day Brunch . Thank you Roger and wonderful staff for having everything g prepared the morning g if my brunch! Fresh, perfect, and enjoyed by many  Happy New Year"}
{"text":"I hate to say the same thing as everyone else but I have to commend the staff here. They are consistently friendly, helpful and fast. The service is outstanding and the food is great- they have a large selection of salads and sandwiches and breakfast items. I like the fall harvest salad and the CBLT salad, but try anything- it is all good. Parking is plentiful."}
