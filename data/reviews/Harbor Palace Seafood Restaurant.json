{"text":"I use to go to this place every time I came to LasVegas but,I went there on March 29th,and got the Salt Pepper Lobster,and the waiter brought a parcel lobster and tried to pass it off as a whole lobster! When I question him on the rest of the lobster,naturally he got upset because I caught him trying to scam us! Needless to say we will not go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.  Beef with oyster sauce and salt and pepper pork were my two favorite dishes here. General Tao and ginger chicken were not great. Service was ok, the ladies speak minimal English. On the upside, our food came out quick. Also, the dim sum part was good. Think ill come back solely for Dim sim next time."}
{"text":"If I could give a half of a star I would and that is being generous. We ordered dim sum and regular menu items and it was hands down the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my whole life...and no I'm not being melodramatic. The dim sum was rubbery and had a gelatinous layer covering it and nothing we ate had any seasoning in it. We ordered the fish fillet and my husband bit into something hard that can only be described as rock-like. To top off the disappointing meal, the service was horrible because we had to ask multiple times for everything from our waters to a clean spoon. At the end of our disastrous meal we got handed a $90 bill for food that we didn't even really eat. I begrudgingly paid the $90 and chose not to leave a tip because of the lackluster service and the fact that the manager/owner completely ignored our comments about the quality of food, and after all of that the waitress had the nerve to ask me where her tip was. Needless to say we will never be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were here a little while ago, it was early in the morning, probably about 9ish. We were craving roast duck & dim sum. When we arrived we were greeted and seated,  there were just a few people working we were offered several types of appetizers, we only accepted the dim sum, after about 10 minutes we asked for menus because they didn't hand them to us, a lady took our order; we ordered half a roast duck & steamed rice, as we waited the little carts kept rolling, and rolling, we ate our dim sum and waited for the duck, 45 minutes later we began to feel anxious, we didn't receive a \" it'll be here soon\" or \" we apologize for the wait\" NOTHING.. I say let's wait until the hour, we'll ask what's going on, so we did! After that one lady came near and asked if we were ready to place our order?! We said we already did and showed her the copy of the order & she said oh we're not serving duck at this time... ?!?! We were very upset, the lady who took the order in the first place should have said that to begin with, there was no communication between the employees, they didn't even apologize instead they handed us a check for the drinks and the dim sum. I can say after service like that I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I went with my parents and my mom's plate was dirty. It took them until after we were halfway through our meal to even get us our drinks. The staff going around seemed very disorganized and very unprofessional. The food wasn't even all that great. The first thing you see when you walk in is a very dirty fish tank. It was so dirty and green that you couldn't even see the fish unless they were right up against the glass. The whole restaurant felt extremely dirty and gross. And after finishing my meal, I noticed stuck pieces of dried food on the inside of my water cup, as well as some floating around in the water. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I won't ever go back to this place! Dirty food, Bad customer service, The employees aren't friendly nor nice at all!!! What a shame!"}
{"text":"Compared to the Bay Area dim sum standards, this place is just alright. But, when you are away and had a long night of partying with a hang over, this place hits the spot! Your basic dim sum and reasonable prices. Too bad the cab ride from Aria to Harbor Palace costs $20 in itself!"}
{"text":"Something is terribly wronging the kitchen lately. Used to be good place to have decent dinner. That is all I can say."}
{"text":"I went to this place a week ago, and I would say, it took around 1 hour for me food to be ready.   There were a lot of people that came all at once to the restaurant and for some reason they were able to get their food quick as hell, while my family waited patiently an hour for our food.   Moreover the waiters did not check up on our tables like they did with others. I felt as if I was constantly ignored.   Food was alright. Customer service-  lets me honest - was horrific! They barely had any common customer courtesy.   If you're a tourist finding some food around China Town, #1 rule - and I mean it - don't go to this place! You'll be waiting until the sun goes down for your food! Go somewhere else and get some pho. There's better restaurants out there than this piece of crap.   Thank you for reading!   ?????"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Authentic Cantonese style Chinese food, the way I like it! Prices aren't ridiculous like the Capital Seafood Restaurant in the same plaza. I've only ordered takeout from here, but just found out that they are open until 5 am! Definitely gonna have to try dining in next time.. Perfect time for me to practice my Cantonese!"}
{"text":"We love dim sum and our most favorites are in SF. We got to this one by accident and it was pretty good we even got some bao with chicken in taste we never has. We also order cod fish ala carta which was excellent. The service was good and even few that spoke reasonable English."}
{"text":"The flavors are great here but the portions are small and the food gets cold really fast. Dim sum never tastes good cold. They put a ton of flowers on the tea so it's really dark, even after adding more water. The bean curd it perfect though. The tofu is really smooth and it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Great for a quick dim sum fix."}
{"text":"I went to try this place during my trip to Vegas.  It was horrible.  The food was brought out like 10-15 minutes apart making each dish cold.  It was just way too slow and there weren't that many people in there.  The food itself is okay.  I will not go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Past 8pm late dinner last night, 6/5/15. So hungry so prepared to order. I was not particularly satisfied last February visit but craving for Chinese so we decided to give it another try. Ordered Hong Kong Style Seafood Pan Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Salt & Pepper Squid, and Dim Sum to try (pot stickers, chives dumpling & beef ribs). It didn't take long and within minutes our order served one by one - so glad cz we we were starving! Food was good and surprised to say that this time around, service was decent. It must be because the place is not that packed. Our servers were fast to request for water refills, etc - place overall decently clean/presentable. The man who initially took our order actually came back towards the end to ask if everything wz ok ... that never happened before in any of our previous visits. Again, maybe because it wasn't as packed, but hopefully it stays that way. We'll come back again to enjoy good food ... next time we'll order \"duck\"."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and this place is alright. Not the best I have ever eaten but not the worst either.  I usually come here late at night or in the morning/early afternoon. Late night I usually order a fried rice.  Either the Yang Chow, BBQ pork or the salty fish and chicken fried rice. I also usually get an entree like fish with black bean sauce, fried pork chop with salt and pepper, fish with spicy salt and pepper or a soup like the won ton or the hot and sour soup. All the above dishes are pretty decent flavor wise. Good enough for 3am as far as im concerned.  The other times I goto this place are in the early afternoon for dim sum. Last time I went for dim sum they had the carts rollin around as usual. I have never had to fill out any type of paperwork to eat dim sum at this place. The dim sum is decent. I usually get sesame balls, pork bun, shumai, harcow, and chicken feet. All pretty standard in terms of flavor. Nothing really stands out or lets me down.  The service not bad at all. I have been eating at Chinese food joints for over 30 years from Hong Kong to Thailand to San Francisco to New York to Jakarta....you get the idea. All that \"Asian folks are so well mannered and polite\" is some stereotype junk. These cats wanna know what you want to eat and drink and thats it. Dont expect any type of convo/banter especially if you dont speak the same language.  Lots of folks mistake cultural differences for bad attitudes. Dont get it twisted folks. We all have bad days and good days. Maybe I got it all wrong but then again im not an over sensitive attention monster.  Food: B - Step up your food game guys, dont get complacent. Service: B - Train your employees to handle problems better. Cleanliness: C - You really need to do a complete cleaning of the store Overall: B-/C+ - I will continue to eat here just wish they would improve.  This place aint as bad as people are saying. All the basics for a great Chinese restaurant are there. Management just needs to remember that they have to try and improve every single day..."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I really like their black sesame chicken and their pan fried noodle dish. Couldn't stop digging in! My friend took me here for some late night dinner, and we were both starving. We were more than satisfied and left with an eminent food coma. Has a lot of potential!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the way they still serve dim sum the old fashioned way carrying them around with the steam carts. The quality is also very good, I especially like the siu mai and BBQ pork buns. Overall a great place for some authentic Chinese food and great dim sum :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! One word RUDE! This place use to be so good, busy, great customer service, not anymore. Went on a Sunday around 1pm and no wait (which I thought it was weird because from what I remember there's always a wait) there were only 5 other groups. Dim sum was horrible and cold and apparently they ran out of everything. Eveything was dirty; table cloths, plates, utensils, cups, everything had to be taken back for a new set. And if you needing anything no one other then your server could help u everyone else will ignore you. Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Best dimsum! Yea right. Not a best place to get dimsum. Taste awful, and very expensive."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest place to eat Chinese food ever!  We sat down we saw the bowls  and the spoons on our table still have left over rices. One of our water cup has a yellow ring inside and i was able to remove it easily a straw, not sure what it was so we left that cup if water alone!. Either the health inspectors in Las Vegas are too gamblely or they always been doing a lousy inspection job!!"}
{"text":"2.5  Most of us would agree: At 3 AM, just about anything you put in your mouth tastes pretty good.  Tired and hungry, I was more than happy to let my chinese dining companions order. Many of our desired dishes were actually not on the menu but  the owner was more than willing to accomodate. Just keep in mind that you may be paying a bit of a premium for your special requests, like $14 for a bowl of rice porridge! Holy rip-off for rice porridge, Batman!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, everything started out fine. The check came out around $30 and I gave the server $100 bill to pay for it. I can see the server handing the cashier the money and her giving the change back,  he pockets the $70 change and leaves to smoke in front of the restaurant . OH HELL NO!!! I run up to the cashier, explain to her what happen, she didn't speak a word of english and  now im using a calculator t explain that the server TOOK MY MONEY,  thinking i just tipped him over 50%... so the man server comes back in and now im yelling at him that he took my money and he's yelling me that I tipped him 70 bucks and its his.... Wooo SA ...  I made a scene and got my change back.."}
{"text":"Ordered dim sum for take out. When I arrived, two of three items were unavailable. I asked for two other substitute items. Also unavailable. Why did you even take my order when you are out of what I asked for?!? Next time, save me a trip."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitress didn't understand the order. Dirty. No paper towels in bathroom. They didn't wash their cups before they gave them to us. Had nasty residue on the bottom. Disgusting never coming here again."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have ever been to. The service is horrific and the server named Chuong is terrible. I made 3 simple requests and he still could not carry it out. The food is decent. Would not recommend, not getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"This is my first time using Yelp.  I read the Harbor Palace reviews and almost didn't come.  I am a USA citizen that works for a Chinese Company.  I eat Authentic Chinese Food all the time both in China and USA with my Chinese colleagues.  For those that wrote poor reviews probably due to you not appreciating authentic Chinese.  You don't order chow Mein here.  You order authentic food!  The food is awesome!  2nd time this week!"}
{"text":"[Eng/Chn]Worst service ever. Sum up: food taste too normal, tea taste like left over, congee taste like water, service extremely horrible, disrespect to the customer and inpatient attitude. I could write an essay for the report. ????????????????????????????????????????ridiculous?? ????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????10?????????????????????????????????\"????????????????\"????????????????????????????\"???????????????????????????\" ???????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????\"????? ?????????\" ?? ??????????????? ?????????????????????????? ??? ????????"}
{"text":"Worst service, workers speaking loud on their phone, flies all over, workers don't speak english, unable to use their own coupon, food sucked."}
{"text":"The food was horrible!  First, the Cheung Fun (rice noodle rolls) were hard.  Second, the lady was asking if I wanted Siu Mai and I said yes.  The Siu Mais came with no wraps and they tasted awful.  Later on, I saw the real Siu Mai with wraps and ordered.  They tasted bad too cuz they were sour!!!  but they were the usually Siu Mai I eat.  I asked the lady about the ones without the wraps, she said those were Crystal Siu Mais.  The first lady didn't tell me about it."}
{"text":"first time I came here for lunch with my aunt had dimsums and seaame balls before heading to cali by bus. then it became my fave spot because of their buchi. next dine was with my friends, good food."}
{"text":"So, I never write reviews, but I had to.  Avoid this restaurant!  The food was bland and just not good. I've had better take-out Chinese food. Checked in to get the free egg rolls. They were extremely oily and not tasty.  Again, avoid this restaurant. It's not worth your money let alone your time. Oh, I agree with the other reviews. The service is lukewarm."}
{"text":"Excellent Cantonese seafood and meats. Very generous portions and very reasonably priced. All Chinese clientele knows this is a place to get authentic.  Also, service was wonderful.  Manager even added an egg and scallion dish at no cost because \"he thought we'd like it\".    Be smart about ordering. Consider their strengths  and take the time to see what the Chinese customers are ordering. You'll have a very memorable meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family but thats because we didnt know of any other places for dim sum. Here are a few of my complaints: 1) they charge for hot tea when most places dont. 2) not all of the food is served hot even though you see steam rising from the pans. 3) some of the food carts just pass you by without even acknowledging you as a table waiting to see what food is available. 4) you dont really get much service here.   I think Im gonna try to find new places for dim sum next time im in vegas."}
{"text":"I came here around 10AM, and only about 3 other tables were occupied. You can pretty much seat yourself, and all the waitresses are nice. The ladies pushing the carts were actually polite, too! Of all the dimsum places I've been to, the waiters have always been pretty rude.  The dim sum was pretty good! Just like other typical dimsum places. I had it so often in my childhood, I kind of lost appreciation for it.  I really liked their pineapple bun filled with custard. So delicious! It was a new alternative that I hadn't had before.  Their fried dough ball coated in sesame seeds with the ground black sesame filling is amazing! Crunch & crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside. I totally blanked out on what this dish is called in Chinese... lol sorry.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come here for dimsum when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food taste good.  Portion is very small.  There is almost no service but charge 18% tip - this is not right!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, and the dim sum was well-priced. Pork bun was my fave. Service was decent. Def worth it when in chinatown, and worth the trip if you're craving it!"}
{"text":"Love the food, place is old and out date, little dirty, service is not that great..."}
{"text":"Absolutely no customer service!! The waiter doesn't even offer a greeting just rudely asks what we want and then quickly walks away before we can finish what we're saying. Food is just ok. Decor is outdated. Definitely will not come back here. Good luck getting the checked. Waved down the server but they ignored us. Not that we wanted to pay for this awful experience."}
{"text":"I had Dim Sum here with my family and it was really good. The service was also real good. It seem like all the waiters and waitresses came every minute or so to check up on us. The Dim Sum was pretty good too.  This place you NEED to check up especially if you are with a whole group and is looking for some Dim Sum for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good Dim Sum. Some of the food was warm at best.   The rest was hot and fresh. I don't know why people are giving bad reviews.  I'm Chinese and it was fine to me. I've read bad reviews about the bathrooms...  They are \"Circus Circus\" clean bathrooms NOT Mandalay Bay bathrooms which is fine for a small restaurant. The people are very nice and polite. The prices are a bit on the high side compared to other places but I am not from the area or state so I cannot comment on the cost of living.  I had hot tea but asked for cokeS for my wife and daughter and they knew to bring forks for them.  Overall they have good food and good service, but prices on the high side. There were 3 of us and the bill was $60+. However I did have some take home so you could subtract about $8 of it...  I also went a bit overboard since I have not had Dim Sum in quite awhile."}
{"text":"As I had mentioned earlier, I finally moved to LV. Unfortunately for me, I caught a bug or virus or something (will sleep it off after this review) on the drive down here. Wanted something from HP, but nothing too greasy.   When I was inching past Hoover Dam, I thought, \"Why not won ton mein?\" (For those who don't know, it's thin noodles with won tons and some bok choy in chicken broth.) Not the most complex, but it satisfied a need. Asked for some char siu (boneless spareribs), and dinner was complete.   Oh, and they did update the place ...   by putting a solar-blocking shade on the windows. Small steps before big steps."}
{"text":"Food: 4 out of 5 stars. Everything else: 0 out of 5 stars.  The food was good. The service was horrendous. We had made a reservation for 20 people after my cousin's wedding, they only sat down 1/3 of us and gave other tables to other people. Once my group finally sat down 20 minutes later, my table of 9 waited 20 minutes to put in our order (we couldn't catch the waitress because she kept running around and wouldn't listen to us) and then we waited 1 hour to get our food. We were so hungry, we finished our 6 plates of food in 15 minutes. What a lame way to spend our post-wedding dinner! So sad haha. The busser was more on top of it than our waitress. 6 out of 9 spoons we were given had visible food stains--when we asked out waitress for new ones, she seemed confused and in disbelief. Everyone else around us got their food well before us, even though they sat down after us. When we asked our waitress where our food was and if we could talk to a manager, she shook her head and mumbled something and ran away from our table. We asked another passing waiter the same thing, to which he laughed nervously and said \"No manager\" and also ran away. Not sure if he meant \"No I'm not letting you talk to my manager\" or \"No there is no manager here, you fools.\" Which it would be easy to believe that there was no manager because clearly this place was unmanaged and poorly run.  Don't waste your time with this place, the food was good but the service makes it completely not worth it. I'm the LEAST picky/bourgeois person and this place was so ridiculously awful I had to leave this review."}
{"text":"we came here laate at night, so i didnt expect the food to be too good. oh well, we didnt really want to keep searching for restaurants at 11 PM. you cant argue with the prices here, if you order the combo with like 6 dishes. the food was ehh, average. everything was cooked well, but the flavors werent too good. i dont think its THAT bad, i can imagine myself giving this place maybe 4 stars during regular dinner time IF the customer service was a little better"}
{"text":"Holy eff I am gonna get started writing a review about this shit hole. Do not waste your time on this palce. Everytime you ask for something it is like a problem."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun here and went twice in one week.   Dim Sum was the reason we were here.  We enjoyed all they had to offer on their Dim Sum menu.  All the food was great and prices were exceptional.   If you are traveling with a group, this is so much easier and cheaper.  The staff was friendly, Restaurant was clean, coupled with the great food and service - what more could you want!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Horrible food and service too!!! Ordered chicken poridge, the chicken was smelled!! Dimsum its just ok..i could make better than that. And talking about the service?! While we still eating with full of food on the table they gave us the bill already, really??!!  And right before we left the waiter yelled at us asking \"u dont give me a tip??\" We did left tip on the table, she dont even check it just yelled and asked us! Very very rude! Never ever in my life will back to this place again!!! Neveeerrrrrrr!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here! Worst Dim Sum in town...everything was super greasy and didn't taste good. Some of the dishes seems like it was from yesterday. The (Hum Sui Kok) was greasy, soggy and not crispy. Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for more than 10 years and the place had not change so much. We always come here when we are in town after church before heading back to California or late nights after drinking. Dimsum cart is our favorite specially the shrimp hargow, shrimp fried rice,  fish or from legs congee and steamed Chicken."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would and it how bad this place is.   totally disappointed.    service was bad, I mean bad.  No greeting, no smile and just in the hurry want my money."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. First time I go and was not happy. First the waiter got mad when we told him it was a party of 12 and they did not want to join the tables which we said we didnt mind them being seperate. Then we are ready to order our drinks and they were not waiting for everyone to order so they kept coming back and forth and what trully ruined the night was the last thing they did. THEY ARE VERY RUDE . I was ordering the entrees and asked how the dinner special worked and told them to give me a second since i was translating for my in law. She said i cant wait for you ,now you wait for me and i said ok. Made sure the whole table new what they wanted and when i said excuse me we are ready this time, she completely went passed us and ignored my party so we left. Then she went outside and thought we can come back inside and since she was ready for us but Like really you had one other table aside from us . DONT TELL ME YOU WERE BUSY! unless you are patient dont  go here. I cant tell you if the food was at all good because we didnt make it that far."}
{"text":"This place is really on top of things. I love the food here, and actually this place is really great for family dinners. It's great! Waiters/waitresses were on top of taking care of us (we were a group of about 12) and great at taking dishes that were finished to get it out of our way.  Definitely coming back here for a family event."}
{"text":"The food was horrible! I ordered the seafood fried rice. It came with some imitation seafood...chewy and disgusting! Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"The Place: Older, Didn't seem that Clean The Service: Rude / Slow... Even though they weren't busy. Food took awhile to come out.  The Food: The food was ok. Portions were not that great for Family Style Chinese Food. The menu stated a charge of $1.50 for a glass of water. (Though I wasn't charged for it)   Wouldn't Go Again"}
{"text":"This place is gross. I'm sure they can't pass a health inspection. I think the food is not fresh and the service is bad too. Dirty shabby place.  Go to the golden nugget for sim sum."}
{"text":"I checked into this restaurant without going through the reviews from Yelp. That was a total mistake on my part. I was visiting Vegas and went to a grocery mall and I saw this dim sum restaurant nearby with beautiful pics of dim sum posted on the window. Due to convenience, I checked into this restaurant and ordered some dim sum.  The quality of the dim sum was sub par and I totally regret not checking out current reviews on Yelp. Dim sum there did not taste good, quality was not good and in such a highly populated Chinese community in Vegas. The problem is that it's expensive. I would not mind paying more for quality and good dim sum, but not on this restaurant. I used yelp review to find a close to 4 stars review on a dim sum place in Vegas called Chang's Hong Kong cuisine, dim sum there was undoubtedly much better than this restaurant. Always check for reviews from yelp first before trying a restart out, or you will regret."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago.  The service was horrific.  Rude and impatient staff.  Price is weird and they charge you for everything.  Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Okay, so, obviously Harbor Palace is not the best Chinese in the city.  Most of their dishes are so-so, some are revolting, but a few are memorable (braised sea bass in a hot pot = get it NOW).   Their menu is extensive when in comes to the seafood.  Abalone, shark fin, geoduck clams, lobster, crab, they got it!    I will beat you, however, if you order the honey walnut shrimp.  Picture Long John Silver's fried shrimp topped with room-temperature, Kroger mayonnaise.  Yep, that's their \"famous\" honey walnut shrimp! I'm still hunting down the person that recommended it to me.    Also, be warned that their waitstaff may or may not mistreat you.  I personally enjoy rude Chinese restaurant waitstaff but you may not.  They get three stars  simply because their staff are extra grumpy.  Really, I love brusque waiters.  P.S. - If you're a glutton for punishment, get their frequent diner card.  You'll get coupons for free food (I guess, if you want it...)."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery. I don't know if they do the same awful foods like that for eating in the restaurant. The vegetable under the walnut shrimp has gone bad, and it only have 3 small walnuts inside. The general sao's chicken is bitter?and the broccoli inside is yellow.  And they are all more expensive than other restaurants. Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Worn down uncomfortable booth seats, not many dim sum carts and restroom pretty messy. Good luck,"}
{"text":"Ok here we go! Stumbled upon this place and what a great find. Simply put, delicious. I am not a huge fan of dim sum but could tell by looking at it that it's authentic. Ordered off the menu, beef with oyster sauce, wor wonton soup, combo fried rice, mu shu pork all fantastic. My new go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years.  I make it a point to stop in when I'm in town.  Yes, the carpet is old but I'm not here for the carpet.  Yes, this is a \"typical\" Chinese joint.  Forget the aesthetics.   I'm here for the food.  I've been here for both the Dim Sum and for dinners.  This last trip (6/9/16) was for dinner.  We had the salt & pepper squid.  It was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  House stir fried noodles and stir fried chives tips... yummy.  The clams in black bean sauce was tasty.  If you want fresh seafood, give this place a try.  Don't bother trying this place if you expect 5 star service, you won't get it.  I want fresh and I want yummy.  Must try!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a rather high rating which I thought would impress my asian elders on our recent trip to Vegas.     I've been here in the late hours to eat peking duck which wasn't bad, but wasn't great.     Then I decided to bring a party of 17 to this restaurant for dim sum on Sunday and made reservations.     I was asked why I chose this place as everyone was disappointed that the food was not that great.     It's hard to explain, but it's just hmm...  Service was good.   But the food just didn't seem up to par.   Was it bad?   Not really... but it wasn't good.     The place we used to go to on decataur which tends to change ownership or names every time we visit (yearly or longer) that I thought I would check this out.     The other place had poor selection of dim sum vs. this place, but the food was tastier, hot, etc.   Here is was just... average.  So I hope the rating drops below the 4 stars because this is not above average and while I would go there again... I must protest their dim sum is not the best and what's funny is that the elders I brought would have rather gone to the restaurant with less selection and packed.  I rather enjoyed not having to fight to get food, but oh well... relaying the message of the party of 17 so that Yelp gives a better or accurate score.    (Yes, you have to assume that I know what I'm talking about :^P)"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the dim sum at this restaurant.  The food was very good, the service was very good, and my family and I left very satisfied. We will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"very nasty food and service,,, house fried rice taste like poh poh and fish entree is a no no...overall a nasty place and oh receipt is all in chinese and has no breakdown....."}
{"text":"Literally the best dimsum place I've ever had! Great options and the food tastes great! The service can be slow and the ambiance isn't the best but it's really low key and definitely worth it for the amount of food and the quality of the food. The place is toddler friendly and they don't complain or make faces if something is accidentally dropped. They have coupons and are really nice"}
{"text":"I've never associated good Chinese food with snappy decor, so the typical kitschy accoutrements actually made me smile rather than otherwise. However, the nostalgia and good vibes ended there.  The scallops were dry, the chicken feet were tasty but a little too oily and had clearly sat in the dim sum steamer for too long. The pork spare ribs dim sum were alright.  All in all, I'd go again in a pinch, but not otherwise."}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to find a Chinese restaurant that's tasty enough to be a regular haunt. Reviews for Harbor Palace have never been great so it really wasn't on my radar. We only stopped in because I've driven by it hundreds of times and curiousity had finally gotten the better of me.   We had eggrolls, sweet & sour chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce. The eggplant was really good, the rest was fine. Service was lackadaisical, but I suspect the language barrier might have something to do with it."}
{"text":"Is so bad. The food on the menu sound great but totally different when they come out. The price is too high and no lunch special either. We used to eat here in the morning for dim sum. Decide to go for lunch and I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you need to get your fix of chinese food in vegas...this is the place to come!  The best part about it is that it is open past 3am!  The worse part was that our food took over 30 minutes to come!  I highly recommend getting the Singapore style vermicelli noodles.  Sooooooooooo gooood!"}
{"text":"i hate this place. i will never go back.   the chinese female servers here are the rudest people on earth. me and my party of 5 went around 1pm on monday to have some dim sum.   just fyi, i am not chinese. they continued to YELL at me in chinese as i was asking them what was in their dim sum carts. why do they have such  big stick up their arses? so what if i don't want the tripe or chicken feet? damn it lady, all i want is some har gow and shu mai.  practically threw our plates on the tables as if they were ninja stars.   i swear... if the food was good, i would give it at least 2 or 3 stars. but you know what? the food ain't even that great. sub par dim sum, blandest combination fried rice, the only thing that was ok was the duck noodle soup.  just thinking about this place gets me riled up."}
{"text":"Horrific!!! . bad service, bad food. Couldnt wait to leave. Before choosing this place after a 4 hr drive into Vegas and hungry at 12:30, we said lets pick this place, can never go wrong with dimsum.... Was  friggin wrong!! sat over 15 min with just a table cloth. No one came to our table (not even the cart ladies) for chopsticks, water, plate...nothing! I had to get up to ask. the cart ladies kept not going our way for over 10 min (even after we recd utensils. The floor planning is horrible. People were getting up with their tixs just to go get their own food. After 3 friggin horrific gross plates 45 min later (because thats all we could stomach) we left. 3 plates for $11.85. Are u kidding me!!?? Went to the bakery nx door,paid  $1.50 for my tasty heavenly bbq pork bun. Never again to this place!!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is very salty and the selections were not fresh at all!  On top of the lousy food, they tried to charged me 2 extra items!  I always count how many we order.  The worst part of all is that the place is so dirty!!  I will never come again"}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  My fried rice looked and  tasted like yesterday's dried out rice.  It was hard and crunchy.  Disgusting!  The war wonton soup was disappointing.  Soup had no flavor and the ingredients were soft and bland.  The only thing I enjoyed was the diet Coke that came in an unopened can.  Over $70 for lunch for 3.  Never again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be hoppin' and THE PLACE to go for great Dim Sum in Las Vegas. You can tell as the place is always jammed packed with customers. There might even be a slight wait for a table. That's how good it was.   It's been a few years since I've been back, and I forgot why I stopped coming. Well, my last visit confirms it. Dim Sum not as tasty as it was. Doesn't seem fresh either. The fried noodles were dry and seemed like they were sitting on the cart for some time. I didn't bother to order the Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli) as it looked over cooked and cold. The place is out dated, old and dirty. There's even a smell of body odor throughout the place. I think it's stuck in the old carpet.   I'm sorry for the harsh comments. But I wanted to be completely honest and not have other customers be disappointed like I was. Go anywhere else but here if your looking for Dim Sum and a pleasant dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"I told myself, I'd try not to give 2 stars to restaurants, BUT eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeks this place was HORRIBLE.  I started off giving this place 2 stars, but after thinking about what I was going to write, i've downgraded it to a 1 star.  FOOD: each dish tasted OLD. The dim sum tasted like it was a day old and were just reheated to serve.  service: contrary to other reviews, the servers were actually friendly ambiance: diiiiiiiiiirty south, including the bathroom. yuck.  How the heck can you go wrong with dim sum? I should've yelped this place before deciding to meet up with some buddies.  5 girls= all gave 2 thumbs down each."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas this past weekend and were craving some dim sum. We weren't expecting much, but we were pleasantly surprised by the food and price!   We had orders of shu mai, shrimp noodle, chicken feet (only for one person), the free egg rolls with check-in, and more, and left stuffed! In total, our bill came out to be around $10 per person.   The service was good; everyone who greeted us was friendly and attentive. The reason this is getting four stars is because of comparisons back home in OC in Southern California. Still, I would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"A regular late nite/early morning stop for gf and i  but we finally hit the place for dim sum this last sunday.  This might be our new \"go-to\" dim sum spot - Orchids used to be our place ( prior to that chang's ) but given their shutdown ( i assume a temporary thing ) for health violations, we need to find a few spots ( we still like PPP )   GF and I agree that the dim sum was consistently served hot and fresh.  The standard dim sum fare ( served on carts ) but the gf thought the selection was limited and nothing unique ( i agree on the uniqueness but i was ok with the selection )   the price is also a little higher than the other places ( $39 bill for the 2 of us - that's the most we've paid for a dim sum meal ) but i was so appreciated of the food being well prepared, hot and fresh."}
{"text":"We ended up here because we had a restaurant.com gift card for $15 off of $30. We got the dinner combination A. The food was pretty good but nothing to write home about. We had a ton of leftovers which is always a good thing. I would only go back to try the dim sum."}
{"text":"We were worried about coming here due to the poor yelp reviews. However ,we were really yearning for dim sum. We decided to come in and try this place. The Siomai, congee, sesame balls, chinese brocolli, shrimp dim sum, tripe dish and spare ribs were actually good. Service was also efficient and friendly. Prices were also good. Glad we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Late night in Chinatown this is one of the few places that are still open at 1:00 in the morning. Despite the dirty/sticky menu, the food actually quite nice. Beef chow fun was tender and flavorful, and the mushu pork was well cooked. The bread tortilla was dry though, and made it tougher to roll up.   Staff friendly Parking easy Free egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars...but the lowest I can give is 1. ANYWAY, service is ridiculously AWFUL in this place. I don't know if they have something against Filipinos, but three groups of Filipinos have walked out since we sat here.  Yes, I am here at the restaurant writing this review.  Why?  Because we have been waiting for our dimsum for 20 minutes now.  I am doing this review to kill time.  When we got here, we were never handed the menu.  BUT, the other two groups who came in after us, were handed their menus AND GIVEN SUPER VIP TREATMENT.  They gave their drinks right away and their menus.  When we flagged down the person (with glasses) at the front reception area who sat us down (since no one was around to help us) to ask for menus, he dropped the menus on our table as if we were a big inconvenience to him.  Same for when he dropped off the food we ordered...he dropped it on our table like he was forced to work today or not getting paid to work here. Also, while writing this, three groups of Filipino have walked out of the restaurant because of their service.  SO, if you are craving for Chinese food...DO NOT COME HERE!!!  Service is terrible!!!!  Avoid this place!!! Go somewhere else where it is worth to pay your hard earned money for food and service."}
{"text":"My dad and I just ate lunch there and it was a horrible experience. My bean curd dim sum had a screw in the sauce! I wish I had taken a picture of it. They exchanged it for a new one so we carried on with our lunch. But then, my dad bit into his sesame ball..... and his cap (tooth) came out! He bit onto something very hard, possibly a bone, something that should not have been in there. It took forever to get the manager to come to the table. She then said it was not a real tooth so it wasn't their fault and that my dad needs to be more carful when eating sticky foods. No apologies. No attempt to resolve anything. Very rude and argumentative. After much resistance she comped our meal. Unacceptable customer service! Poor food."}
{"text":"The worst dim sum place! The food tasted old like it was from previous day. Service was horrible. We asked for water refilled 3 times still no one came back with water even though there was only 2 tables in there. The best thing they had was fresh orange they gave at the end. We will never go back there again..."}
{"text":"Charged us $96 for a catfish after quoting price as $30 (still too much for the small gnarly fish we got).  All I could do was laugh and wish I had eaten on the strip."}
{"text":"Ran through the Plaza to go to Ranch 99.  They were all out of the steamed sweet white rice cakes but had other things I needed.  On the way back to the car I passed by Harbor Palace and saw the painted 'dim sum' sign on their window.  All dim sum places have rice cakes, right?  It appeared very busy when I walked in but an older Chinese man came to the podium to ask for my order.  I asked him if they had the cakes, he walked over to a nearby cart and held up the asked for cakes.  I nodded and said I would like two orders.  He went to a little side table to box them and came back with them in a bag.  He said the charge was $5. Which I paid in cash. At home I opened the styrofoam container to find two 5x5 inch squares about 1/2 inch thick.  That was 2 orders for $5!  They were just okay, taste wise... If this is an indicator of their food, my recommendation is to pass."}
{"text":"The servers were all nice and friendly. We ordered 1/2 roast duck it was delicious and the serving was generous, the garlic eggplant and black bean chowfun were also tasty.  The hot and sour soup was a little different , more hearty ,than I'm used to but it was really good too . The sweetsour spareribs and lemon chicken were not good. Lots of parking.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new so I got out of my comfort zone and tried this place out. I'm not a picky eater so I just went with whatever was brought to the table. The food was very good and made fresh. I enjoyed all the plates that were served Including the chicken feet. The only thing this place is lacking is a smile amongst the servers. They're a little pushing on making you say yes to plates so stand your ground and just say no if you don't want the plate. I would come back if I felt a little more welcomed too. I give this place another try in the future. Till then."}
{"text":"After moving out of LA I though I was never going to have good Chinese food; but, I was so wrong....this place is just like Chinatown in LA...well worth it! Thanks chinos locos..."}
{"text":"This place was good! The food is relatively good and the prices are pretty average also. Not too expensive not too cheap. The food is tasty and fast- the dishes arriving at your table in a steady past. The servers are nice and helpful as well. Overall had a good meal."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good hot and fresh go in the morning less crowd rather than lunch hour but they can make dim sum at odd hours just request it.  This place makes great beef stew hot pot and half roast duck serving is plentiful and yu may have to take left overs home. Recommend to friends and family. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Bless our server, she was doing her best. But the management and restaurant have no idea what's going on. Everything is dirty. We ordered 8 dishes and only 7 came out. The server kept asking the kitchen for it, we could hear the yelling, but it didn't come until the very end of our meal. When I tried to complain to the manager about having the late dish taken off my bill she tried to pin it on the server. It was not the servers fault. The restaurant is unorganized. Food is decent but not worth the extravaganza"}
{"text":"I've lived and been to many major cities to know what good food is. And I've never gave a review before but I had to for this one. This place needs to be shut down! Everything about it from customer service to quality of food is unsatisfactory. Place looks dirty too! If a place serves daily dim sum it better at least taste fresh, but it wasn't. I came to try it out only because a friend referred it. We came in a large group of almost 20. We waited a Long time for dim sum cart to come around. Had to go ask them to bring cart around. I feel the the waitress played dumb by asking several times what we need to order. Told her 1 chicken shark fin soup and 1 lobster dish.  She comes out with 2 lobster dish and 2 soup!!!! Wth?! Soup was $49 for a bowl that serves 5 small cup. The soup tasted so plain! We didn't order it but got it anyways. We also ordered clams which never came out. And ate dim sum. When the ticket came out it was ridiculous amount for place like that! Almost $500! Overall the food quality doesn't match prices on menu. Over priced!!!They charged $8 for 1 bowl of steam rice! They charged us for  60 dim sum dishes too. The numbers looked really off!  I would say 40 but not 60! I went to check on price with cashier and came back to count empty dim sum plates but they had cleared off everything on table! Not to mention the waitress followed me to spy on me when i went to talk to cashier. Must be a reason for that! They are scammers! I've heard of dim sum places that over charge u but I've never experienced it. I'm never ever coming here again! I highly suggest not to come to this place."}
{"text":"The WORST dim sum & HORRIBLE service ever! Food was bland. Place is dirty. Don't bother coming if u dont speak chinese. All the carts purposely skipped our table. We waited forever & always got the last picks when it was cold & not fresh. Everything SUCKED!!!"}
{"text":"Service sucked; asked for water 3 times personally and a few times by others at my table, and it didn't come until after we asked over 5 times. Same thing for additional sauces. Huge language barrier in this restaurant; bring someone who can speak and understand Chinese for adequate service."}
{"text":"This place is horrible with customer service and their staff is wearing this weird mouth guard wth.... Got me wondering what is wrong with this place!!!! Food is old, stale, and you have to chase your food down cause they attack us with one cart of dim sum and then that was it. All I can say is horrible horrible horrible service. Never coming back"}
{"text":"After a big night out, went out here at 4AM to grab a quick bite before heading home!  Service was fast! Like \"You-Just-Ordered-10-MINS-ago\" fast but sh*t... FOOD WAS SERVED COLD!!!! and i meant, NOT EVEN WARM or ROOM TEMPERATURE at least?  The two quickest food you think they can prepare in a hurry, egg drop soup and chow mein, was probably a left over from the night before and didn't even bother to heat it up for us!   YUCK!!!!  Do yourself a favor!!!  Go somewhere else or just buy yourself a bowl of noodles from 7-11. Don't even think about going here!!   LOVE LIVE THE \"PANDA\". LOL"}
{"text":"Basic dim sum in a strip mall. Food is fine. Service is what you should expect in a place like this -- few basic dim sum places are going to get lots of service points -- but it works. The food isn't something you are going to write home about , but it is fine.   The place was not very busy when we went on a Saturday a little before noon.   Note: If you take cab there have them call you one when you are ready to leave, we had a lot of trouble finding one."}
{"text":"Yuck Yuck about 2 years ago this was a Decent joint for authentic Chinese What Happend??? I am in Vegas and my family chose to return What a Mistake and where do I start First of all the place was filthy the rest room faucets were broken only hit water worked the tea was served with Luke warm water we ordered four dishes came out to $70 the service stunk my two boys wanted a smoothie for desert so I ordered two after I paid for the bill we waited 25 additional minutes as they forgot and were under staffed other people were upset at the bad service Chinese and tourists And the food was ok at best I will never go back there again and it was so bad it felt like the place had been taken Over due to a gamblers debt and the new owners have no idea when it comes to running a restaurant Funny thing I asked  My wife if she wanted to walk out when we first got seated but we stuck it out as We were starving kid thing but I should have trusted my instinct and visited the restroom before I ordered This place stunk and if they don't clean up there act I have a feeling they won't be in business very long"}
{"text":"This is one of the first Chinese joint to opened up Chinatown, and I really cannot stretch how distinguish this place is.  It is one of those place you cannot avoid seeing driving down from the Strip.  The décor was quite run down and dirty.  They served dim sum and other Chinese dishes.  Dim sum looked ok on average, while some of them looked somebody like vomited on it.  The taste was mind blowing in a negative way.  Some of them tasted like cardboard, while some just tasted bitter, and choices seem very limited.  The regular dishes had a unique bland flavor and gooey look to it, which was not appetizing at all.  Service was terrible here!  We called out for to the staffs a few times with no response and finally had to make some loud noise to get their attention, which really reminded me of mainland China.  Harbor Palace Seafood... Thank you for giving our group diarrhea on the way back to Utah, something was definitely undercooked.  On another hand, I found my worst Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  I never knew such taste can exist in dim sum, even worse than the worst in my home state.  Maybe that is one reason to try this place?"}
{"text":"Have not been here in years AND WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!, After reading the other reviews it seems as though nothing has changed.  I still remember the visit here vividly as it was the worst experience i have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life! I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry. We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice. About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting \"why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait\" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!! He said the host who takes the checks wouldn't budge and said how does he know its not our fault and we keeping the food anyways even though we said we didn't want it he said ok we still made food if u keep or throw away u still have to pay! Unbelievable!!! If you want to experience a nightmare go here! Not saying your experience will be as horrendous as mine , but just thought I'd share my dining out nightmare here as I can see I'm not alone In this.  Yelp should have a \"worst restaurant poll\" guarantee this will come up! Shut harbor palace down!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason I think of buffets and steakhouses when in Vegas but hey it's always good to try something different, so this is my first Chinese restaurant in LV.  Service was okay, dim sum food was average, prices were cheaper than Mei Sum back home."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum but not much variety going around.  Overall, just ok."}
{"text":"This place opens late. We came here for a really late dinner and we ordered:  Beef Chow Fun: This was ok. It came out hot and they gave a good amount. There was a good balance of beef and noodle.  Thousand Year Old Egg Congee: Eh, this was ok. It was slightly watery. This wasn't the best.  Chinese Donut: This was made fresh. It was really crispy and warm. I liked it.  Won Ton Soup: This wasn't that good. The soup broth tasted more like a chicken broth. The won tons were a bit large too.  Service was good. I think it was because we were the only ones here since it was late.   The restaurant is large. They have a lot of tables and enough space for larger groups.  Overall, ok place to eat at if there's no other place open."}
{"text":"Uhhhhhhhhhhhh horrible service!!!! And food takes FOREVER! Literally waited an hour for the food..... If you're seated in the back room, be ready to not get your food. Trust me."}
{"text":"Food's taste are very delicious, no doubt. A short haired & average tall woman seems to be the owner gives awesome customer service alongside with young waiter. But that day was our unlucky day, my girl ordered a yang chow fried rice and seemed they put extra shrimps on it. Despite curious, we did not think negatively.  On night, she began showing alergy symptoms : itchy, rashes, red and swolen skin. We know very well that she has no alergy to any seafood. It resisted for more than a week, thanks to her pediatrician to slowly make her recover. Yeah, there is always a lesson to be learned."}
{"text":"The servers were nice, unfortunately the food was not very good. I tried four different dim sum items. Three were way too salty for my taste. After paying our bill of $17 (plus tip) for two for lunch, we went to the bakery next door to buy a few more items for lunch."}
{"text":"Review regarding Dim Sum: I used to come here a lot, and it used to be good. When I heard they had dim sum, I was so happy. When they brought the first tray, I wanted to leave. They have a very small selection, and it made me want to cry."}
{"text":"I stopped at Harbor Palace for a late breakfast (AFTER shopping at 99 Ranch Market:--note to self--eat BEFORE shopping for groceries...) right when they opened at 10 AM.  I was extremely hungry, and extremely happy with what I got.  I was too hungry to wait and see what all the carts had on them, so I went with char siu bow (bbq pork buns) and the sticky rice dumplings wrapped in leaves.  Then, call me a fool,  I simply had to have the gai lan  (ChineseBroccolli) with \"Korean Sauce\" poured over it.  'Bout the only asian foods I love more than gai lan are fresh lychees and Peking Duck  The gai lan was just as good this evening as leftovers, reheated with a little bit of deep-fried tofu.  I thought the service was decent, not unctuous, not friendly, but decent.  The decor was a bit battered, but I've yet to eat in a Chinese restaurant that has both beautiful decor and great Chinese food.  I'll try to go back once a month and eat my way through all the different things they have to offer on their dim sum carts.  That is, AFTER I try the Chinese BBQ place in the same center and Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast this Thursday..."}
{"text":"We came here as a group and the amount of dish for nine people was too little. All the dish were not fresh and way too salty. Need a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Bad & Slow service.   Saturday at 11:00am 7.3.15. Got a table for 3 in 5 minutes.  Got our drinks right away then the first dim sum food cart came about 5 minutes later. 15 more minutes and no food cart in sight.  We got up & paid for our so called dim sum bill which was 15usd & ZERO tip.  We headed over to the Jade which was formerly Cathay House.  Got all kinds of dim sum food in 5 minutes or less.  Speedy service and food was great also... NEVER AGAIN, HARBOR PALACE..... SMALL and Bad Service.... Save yourself the time from waiting and head over to the Jade which is about 1 miles East of Harbor Palace on Spring Mountain"}
{"text":"first time here, very good food, place seems clean, food is really tasty, prices are reasonable and staff are friendly, love the late hours"}
{"text":"Had a reservation, they didn't have our table ready for 30 min. Pathetically incompetent servers that do not care about giving good service. Waited 40+ minutes for one entree to come out while tables around get all of their good serves before us even though we ordered first.   Also disgustingly unclean utensils that had brown stains on them.   I will be making a report to a local health inspector to make sure this health hazard of a restaurant shuts down.   Avoid at all costs for your own safety"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Food isn't great but it's usually a convenient location and we're not familiar with other dim sum places in the area. We typically order: ha gao (shrimp ball), siew mai (pork ball), loh mai gai (sticky rice and chicken wrapped in leaves), churng fun (rice noodles with beef or shrimp, your choice), and some various buns (nai wong bao - small white buns with yellow custard inside).   They are stingy with the utensils, napkins and soy sauce. If you order to-go and don't ask, they won't give them to you. If you ask, they will only give you one even if you order many items."}
{"text":"Waitress so stupid and bad service. I ask for coke one of them told me don't have and rush me to order and told me\"hurry hurry me busy\". Don't go this place.!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great !!! Service is extremely poor!! I granted a dollar tip! Due to a huge language barrier orders were lost in translation. Even if you ask with a charming smile accompanied with a polite please the waitress greeted you with furiously rolling eyes and a disgruntled grunt! Seriously where is my water?!!! I am parched!!  Tip for tat: if you work in the food service industry, Do not count your money in front of your customers with a smile then serve your customers with an ugly frown and poor service!!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I were brought here with friends while in Vegas and we really liked it.  I don't understand the reviews but hey it is what it is. All of the food tasted fresh,  plus get this, my service was good.  Now, I can understand why people think the staff is rude, but they were nice enough for my group.  I totally will go back to this place next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My parentals wanted to go over here because they heard that it was really good. What they found out was that it was really over priced.  The decor is decent and there were a lot of tables but a lot of them were empty too.  Yeah, the food is decent as well and some items are tasty but some of it was sub-par and tasted like you can get it anywhere else for a lot cheaper. I was not a fan of their dim sum chicken feet which was sad because it was China Town and I would prefer one of the dim sum places here in Utah instead. We got some fried rice, fried fish and an oyster stir fry and they were good but way to pricy for what it was worth.  In the land of Las Vegas, you can absolutely find a better place than this without looking too hard. So, I'd pass this restaurant and find a better deal elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can you ask for as a Chinese in Las Vegas........ to have a dim sum place around the Sin City China town..  However, the fact that I am from the San Francisco Bay Area..... makes this restaurant a really so so so so place........   No offensive...but remember, You are in Vegas...not Macau..... so, having more authentic Chinese food around is already a good thing"}
{"text":"My family and I love Dim Sum!  The Harbor palace serves great Dim Sum. We were seated quickly.  Our drink orders were taken    Promptly.  The carts were full and came around often.  The service was great.  My kids loved the fried crab claws!  We all loved the delicious dim sum and the salt and pepper shrimp."}
{"text":"Food is good but the place is kinda dirty. Make sure to use a straw and not drink straight from glass. Lipstick on rim and food stuck inside glass. Yuk!"}
{"text":"This was the worse Chinese food I've ever had and their restrooms are disgusting. It's so dirty and they reuse the complimentary fruits they give you towards the end"}
{"text":"We come to LV a couple of times a year and ALWAYS come to this restaurant.  The last two times have been awful.  Service is OK, but you need to be assertive to get attention.  Food is quick and hot, but bordering on tasteless.  I can make a much tastier noodle plate that they serve, and I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination.  We've been so disappointed.  In fact, I'm on Yelp now trying to find a new Chinese Rest to go to."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after Black Friday shopping. Great selection of seafood: fish, squid, crab, lobster, Oyster, geoduck, and shark fin. Didn't ask whether or not the shark fin was sustainable or not...   Hot and sour soup was good, as well as the sizzling black pepper beef. Chinese broccoli was cooked very well. Very tender but not too soft.  I gave two stars because I found the prices to be high and the service was intermittent. They were very attentive in the beginning and gave great recommendations (sizzling beef and hot and sour soup) but then were nonexistent when e tried to get more hot water for our tea."}
{"text":"This place is dingy though clean. It's painted in a lackluster pastel light blue on the inside. No frills at all here. They serve dim sum the traditional way by having ladies come around with carts. The quality of the food did not convince me. We were also pretty sad that the Chinese Broccoli was not ready yet.... We love our Chinese Broccoli....seriously love it too! They have a very homestyle flavor to their food here. Not that I know what homestyle Chinese food tastes like so much as the food has a really basic flavor to it here. It doesn't really stand out. Some of the dumplings reminded me of Mexican style chicken soup flavor. Not that that is bad really, but still I am used to better tasting dim sum. Service is not bad. They kept on asking if we wanted tea refills which s really good for this kind of place - especially when it's busy. If you do not wish to understand that some people that work and serve food in this country don't speak English terribly well you won't like it here at all and of course - you will mistake it for bad service. Parking is a breeze. This restaurant is in a nice big lot where many of the buildings have pretty Chinese style roofs."}
{"text":"Discovered by my little sister she suggests I go here, we all meet up around 3pm for a late lunch and the place is pretty empty so we get prompt service. The place was a little dirty, burned holes in the plastic (smoking in vegas? ;) ) but let me tell you about the food.   We ordered two fish dishes and a chicken dish along with dim sum. The serving sizes were nicely portioned we had tons leftover. And those who never eat fish were eating the food here and asking for me.  Want to know what I ate? we had to call it all chicken for my little niece to eat any of it, so the dishes were scallop chicken, white chicken, and just to tease her mind we called the chicken dish -- fish. And wow was she proud to tell her mom she liked fish :)"}
{"text":"Harbor Palace serves up average dim sum with a few above average items. The har gow was above average, while the 1K year old egg and pork porridge was bland and tasteless. Other items including the char siu bao and spareribs in black bean were acceptable and average.  The decor was a bit of fusion between Southern China and Vietnamese dive. Plenty of neon signs all plugged into few outlets which left me eyeing the emergency exits in case of electrical fire. I spied a couple of them moving waterfall art on one wall, which amused me with its tackiness and plebian charm.  Prices for the dinner menu are on the high side, but that seems par for the course for LV chinese food. You won't find those family meal deals available at 99% of the California chinese dives.  Service is standard dim sum which means little to no attention. No surprises here. At least you can tip 10% without any guilt whatsoever.  I have a feeling this place is the only game in town for acceptable dim sum, smack dab in the middle of Chinatown. Please prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"Sam woo was closed so we had no choice but to eat here and we got it to go and took it back to our Hotel room. We found and effin worm in our Kang Kong veggies!!! and then to top it off an hour after I was throwing up all night! Disgusting! Do Not Go here!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but chaotic service and a very stressful dining experience.   As another yelper mentioned , it is probably a waste of time writing a review for this place since folks with simply continue dining at this location regardless of the substandard service and the chaotic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Writing a review for this place is kind of a waste because it's probably one of the few places to dim sum in Vegas, therefore, they'll still have people coming in.  Let's start off with how the hostess skipped our number. Our number is 83. She called 82 and suddenly jumped to 87 and 85 went to complain. So she gave 85 and 87 a table and then when we asked she claims she already called us.... so because of her mistake, she stuck us at a table in the back- a table that I don't think was meant to be a table... why do I say that? The table was not set and was never set. Server just put plates down and didn't even put a white cloth over it. I was the only awkward wooden, wobbly table... with no sauce ... I went ahead and took the sauce from table beside me... okay .. whatever. Server bought us our tea and was never seen again... except to serve the tables besides us. CART ladies... simply looks at us and turns around... they would serve the tables next to us and stop beside them.. look over at us and turns around. LOL! WUT??? We only had two dishes and it got so ridiculous I chased after them TWICE. Both times, I let them know we need food, you guys don't even come to us. One lady had the nerve to ask \"where are you sitting?\" I saw you look at our table and turned your cart around and bounced..... Service was non existent. Like wtf. Couldn't even find a server to pay our bill. I would have LOVED to walk out and not pay. Carts rarely came around. Like are ya still serving dim sum or na? Food was average.  2 stars for such shitty seating arrangement and service! I barely even got to taste the food since no one came around and I was tired of running after them."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh, I was so pissed after I got outta that place. In one point of my life, I was totally fascinated with dim sum and for my 21st b-day, we decided to go to vegas (so typical). I am proud to say that I was sober the whole weekend. Anyways, we went there only a Sat. morning and it was pretty packed. We had to wait for about 30 mins. First off, the dim sum here is expensive. I think that's the only thing I remember besides leaving the place and regretting I went there! haha"}
{"text":"Was told by local friends this place is a tourist trap. Well, there was no wait on a weekend, the food was solid, the price was reasonable. All good!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter in for lunch. before we were sitting in our chairs we were bombbarded by 3 or 4 hot carts of various delights(not really my thing) One menu for the 3 of us we ordered sodas they came in cans with glass of ice (I used to get that when I was in PI) Wife and Daughter ordered #4 chicken chow mein I ordered #7 the beef chop suey.  one cart can by with pot stickers they were the highlight of the meal  then another one said to try the fried noodles tasted like they used burnt oil to fry them inedible, then the lunch came not worth 1/2 star for taste or presentation. Sorry I know times are hard but this was not worth the $34 it cost us for a budget lunch.       Now for the service, waitress was impatient with us one menu for 3 people wouldn't' try to answer our questions, Was rude to my wife.  I am going to learn to cook chinese food for myself."}
{"text":"Purpose of visit: late lunch after spending the morning shooting each other during paintball. Group decided to go for a lighter meal given the time. Service is quick and efficient. Food is above average Chinese. Some of the dishes we ordered was fried pork chop. Pieces we battered and fried but a little small. Steamed whole sea bass. Garlic and spring onions made this dish very fresh. Fried rice and noodles were typically reliable.  Space is large and old accommodate a group of 12 very easily late afternoon."}
{"text":"My family always comes here whenever we're in Vegas, but more out of convenience and habit really.  The food here is ok and I would have given the place 3 stars, but it's just soooo dirty here.  I had to take off one star because the bathrooms are horrendous here ... so much so that there were 4 stalls and i almost died going in there ... I couldn't go needless to say and decided to hold it in!"}
{"text":"I Would never order from here again. Found pieces of metal and bones in our sweet and sour. I can only imagine what other type of unseen things were in that food. Gross"}
{"text":"My review is based on the service here. They are awfully rude. I've visited a few times and it's the same every time. I've always ignored it cause the dim sum is decent and at the time, it was the only place I knew in china town to have dim sum. Plus, in general, I always get bad service at Chinese joints. The worst was when we came in a large group. They were so disrespectful throwing our food down, and not responding when we would request something. Our group just sat there in silence at the end of our meal. We started discussing how much to tip. A person in our group who was a residence of Vegas said not too, and said something about how, in Vegas, we don't tip. He was a fairly rude guy himself lol but the worker came behind him, bent over and demandingly yelled in his ear \"15% tip please\". Oh man, he was furious. He stood up and yelled at us and his girlfriend to leave while she was still eating her tofu dessert lol it's pretty funny to think back but at the time, it was the worst experience ever.   Seriously, go to Orchid garden for dim sum."}
{"text":"Good place to get your dim sum fix off the strip. 8 of the 10 items I ordered were very good, the other two were mediocre. See pics n caption.  Xiu Mai, har gow n chicken feet were good, the very basics of dim sum. Check in and get free egg rolls (hardly worth it, they're lame fillers).... Anyway our total check came to around $40.  Other things I saw: small fried fish, chicken wings, seaweed, soft tofu, stewed beef intestines, diff types of fried shrimp balls, deep fried shrimp with head, authentic plain greasy chow mein, steamed Chinese broccoli, bean curd, steamed buns (sweet or with meat filling)... Etc.  Btw, seemed only the owner spoke good English, everyone else.... You can't get too intricate with them. Service was efficient but, some of the dim sum cart ladies need to learn some manners. So owner, pep talk your peeps."}
{"text":"We drove across town to eat some late night Chinese food, to find they closed 30mins early. All because they felt like it, the employees where sitting at tables with their phones out. So unprofessional I will never go back and I am a regular."}
{"text":"When I first moved to LV, the new friends I made took me out to eat here.  I thought, chinese? Why not!  But when I saw the servers rolling carts around I was wondering what kinda restaurant this is.  THEY SERVE DIM SUM! It was my first time ever having dim sum and I had a good experience here.  I noticed the servers would mad dog you if you didnt want anything from their cart.  I found that funny.  They serve all the dishes a chinese restaurant would serve but they're honey walnut prawns are especially good.  Although theres other places I would go first for Dim Sum, Harbor Palace is a good alternative. But then again, its in China Town, and other dim sum spots are close-by. =/"}
{"text":"The service was aweful. Staff seemed to be pissed off at life. The food was not that great."}
{"text":"Try this place every time I am in Las Vegas. It is a hit or miss with the food but I feel the  price is reasonable.  We got seated real fast despite Mother Day. The guy asked us what we wanted to drink I requested for durian shake since they have it on the menu but he told me they don't have, he try to get me order Thai tea, I then try to order the mix fruit tea jar, he then proceeded to get another lady over who then told me that isn't a cold tea but it is a hot tea then proceeded to point to the Thai tea again . In the end I settle with hot tea & ice water. We ordered bitter Mellon with pork rib, super seafood with tofu soup, fried tofu with seafood and sizzling beef hot plate. it was decent but I wouldn't get the fried tofu with seafood again since it tasted bland and got too many broccoli in the dishes as well. There were hardly any seafood in the dish and what I thought was small small to non existing size scallops tastes like fish paste. I didn't find any shrimp in that dishes either and for a moment I thought this is a vegetarian dish.  As for the soup there were lots and lots of tofus, carrots and maybe there are couple of cut up shrimp in the soup basically this could be another vegetarian dish. Overall if you are a meat eater, skip those two dishes but if you are vegetarian, those dishes would be great. The dinner cost about 55$ total for the two of us with some left over food to take home .   For those reviews who complain about the dated decors and run down place, I agreed but I am not there for the place , I am mainly there for the food so the surrounding shabby decors doesn't bother me and beside it is Asian restaurant so I don't expected much"}
{"text":"What you want? The Fu King Rice. You want Fu King Rice? Yes. Anything else? No, just give me the Fu King Rice.  The entrees are actually not bad if you wanted some Chinese grub.  But not really worth coming off the strip just for.  It's OK.  Avoid the dim sum as it is usually not fresh and overpriced, i.e. the steamed stuff have been sitting around long enough for like siu mai/har gow wrappers to start to harden.  Aiyah!  As usual service helps a bit when you can speak Cantonese at these places.  All in all, average."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this five stars, because they serve dimsum all day every day. For anyone who works in the evening shift or for any one who is simply  craving for dimsum, this is the place to be.  Don't expect to get a fast service or quality of service. This place is always jam-packed, tourist buses usually stops over in this place for their lunch or dinner itinerary."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum and a crazy screaming host to boot."}
{"text":"The food is always great and super yummy except for the fried chicken which gets really hard. The place kinda looks a little dirty too ( I guess which is something normal for any chinese restaurant). The staff mostly are chinese which i dont know if I mistake them for being rude or just a communication problem. Otherwise, food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a Dim Sum restaurant in the heart of Las Vegas' China Town. I was quite disappointed with their food. I thought their food selection was very limited and did not seem fresh. The noodles we ordered were dry and lacked taste. The rice congee with mushroom and century egg was okay and was the best part of our lunch. The only positive thing I can say about this place is that the waitress and servers are very nice and friendly. But I'm sorry to say that I would not go back to this restaurant when in Vegas since there are too many other options out there."}
{"text":"My friend did not like his beef dish, and the cut was low quality. I ordered steamed vegeys off the menu- they charged $25 for that. Are they for real? Not planning a return trip."}
{"text":"Nothing says \"I'm thankful for American independence\" like 1AM dim sum on the 4th of July! This place is regularly open til 5AM, which further begs the question: how I have I not been here before?!  Late night dim sum menu is about 15 items, we sampled quite a few. Steamed pork buns were solid, pork shumai were tasty, shrimp balls were fresh, beef tripe was not my bag, and the noodle in the spare rib rolled noodle dish had an odd flowery aftertaste.   Overall, flavors were solid and pricing was fair. Service was nonexistent despite 4 employees walking around. Orchid Garden is my usual go-to spot for gut-busting amounts of dim sum, and it sort of works in Harbor Palace's favor that they have a limited menu: I can come by more often without completely throwing my health goals out the window!"}
{"text":"This place is OK, nothing special and if you come mid afternoon there is not much dim sum to choose from.  There are better places to get dim sum."}
{"text":"I do not know what other people talking about but this place is nice. Very good rost duck and dim sums. Very fresh and cooked to order and price is avarage ( actually rost duck is cheaper than other chinese restaurants in neighborhood) Open ntill 5 am and rice and tea is free. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After a long night in Vegas, I was craving dim sum the next morning. I have been to Harbor Palace for dinner several times but it was my first time here for dim sum.   I have to say, the dim sum was not good! It was very disappointing. I ordered siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, shrimp rice roll, glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf, pork bun, and this vegetarian dish. The soy sauce for the shrimp rice roll was really watered down for some reason so the rice roll tasted really bland. The chicken feet was alright but it was a little too oily for me. The siu mai and shrimp dumpling was alright too. You can't go wrong with ordering that at a dim sum place! The vegetarian dish was a little weird. They used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce and you can tell because the sauce was chunky. It was very unappetizing.   The decor of this place is kind of runned down and old. It definitely needs some renovation, especially because it was one of the restaurants in the main plaza of Las Vegas Chinatown. They should make an effort to build a better image for themselves and for the town.   The place was also understaffed. There was one lady taking care of 3 carts! I felt bad for her that she had to take care of all these tables and also manage her carts.   The tea that we ordered was also not that good quality because after the second refill of hot water, the tea became really bland and lost the taste and aroma of the tea! Usually tea leaves can last through couple of refills.   I am still on the search for a good dim sum place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We went here around noon for dim sum.    One of the things that initially bothered us about this restaurant during the first few times we went was that they had a $10 minimum purchase amount to use credit cards.    Well today when we went, our bill was about $34 for the three of us.  We decided to just have them split it between two credit cards.  The waitress came back and told us \"sorry, we have a $20 minimum purchase per card\".  What????  The fact that they raised their minimum credit card purchase to $20 was annoying, compounded with the fact that the bill was over $20, and she didn't want to do it just because it would have been split between 2 cards.  I told her she had no choice but to take the cards because it's against VISA and Mastercard's rules to impose minimum purchase limits, and they could lose their ability to accept credit cards if we reported them.  She either took my card, or she didn't get paid at all. Simple as that."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Sweet. Jesus. What. In. Lord. Buddha's. Name. Is. This. Restaurant. Doing?  Where to even begin here? The food is piss poor, the restrooms looks like the one from that horror movie \"Saw\", and the service because of the language barrier is horrible. (I may be Asian, but I'm definitely not Chinese)  The waitress was nice and kind, but she didn't understand anything that we were saying.  The food smelled off and was unbelievably greasy, you have no idea. I wish I took photos, but I couldn't because I didn't want a picture of that disgusting pile of slop on my phone.   Please heed my warning, do NOT eat here. DO NOT EAT HERE. Don't do it, it is a total waste of money. This place is terrible. I will give it a second chance only if it steps up its game better."}
{"text":"Wow such excellent service I've eaten at many restaurants in China Town and haven't been treated this well in any restaurant in china town to top it off the food was excellent."}
{"text":"DIM SUM review only.  We came here on a Wednesday during the lunch hour and had the dim sum.  This is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST DIM SUM I'VE EVER HAD.  Hands down, there is no competition.  The siu may tasted old and disgusting; the shrimp dumpling was slightly better, but not much to care for; the spare rib pork on top of rice noodle (huh?) was tasteless and so was the BBQ pork in rice noodle dish; congee also had no flavor; har gow was just lukewarm and tasted just ok.  The best thing we had was the egg custard pastry.  I won't come back here for dim sum ever."}
{"text":"Poor Las Vegas needs to UP their game on DIM SUM. As a San Francisco resident, I know some good Chinese food/ Dim sum. Harbor palace seems to be run down and caters more to.. people who don't know what good Chinese food is. They only had about 2-3 dim sum carts going around with not much of a variety to choose from. We got an order of chicken feet which were huge and tasted right, one shrimp and one beef cheung fun which was okay.. an order of spareribs which sucked... and one ha gao and sui mai which were decent, and an order of sesame balls and cha sui bao which I didn't try. We also ordered a plate of beef chow fun which was decent but very very greasy. Over all the dim sum wasn't fresh, but tasted decent, the prices are steep, and not worth it."}
{"text":"Had the rau muong with chao so delicious.  You must try the sea bass hot pot, it melts in your mouth.  The service is wonderful very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"the order. shu mai har gow bean curd wrap in gravy rice noodle with shrimp gyoza shanghai dumpling  the food here is edible but i think that's where my compliments stop. the dim sum here was not fresh and they use a lot of low quality pork meat--meaning very fatty parts of the pork. the balance of lean and fat was not struck with this dim sum. the rice flour for the har gow was too chewy and borderline hard (as if it was reheated). the shanghai dumpling was probably the worst thing i had. i personally would not return to this establishment but it is an alternative to much of the generic vegas food. not to mention, when i first started out eating dim sum this would have been acceptable to me as im sure it is acceptable to the new palettes of many tourists that probably frequent this place."}
{"text":"So bad! The worst Cantonese Dim sum place I have tried in my life. The food taste extremely bad and food are dirty. The rice roll seemed to be cooked several days ago, rigid and not soft at all. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Place needs some work to be done. But overall I get excellent service here during the late hours after a night at the disco! Hasnt let me down yet!"}
{"text":"I haven't ate dim sum for quite a while and I miss it so much. So when we headed to Vegas, we want to eat that. We found this place in Chinatown plaza. The dim sum wasn't so bad. It's a nice place. At least the service was good."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for dim sum and seafood but it has really gone down hill over the years. I won't be returning, unfortunately. Just doesn't seem fresh, almost like reheated frozen dim sum. And the restaurant is run down."}
{"text":"Not my favorite dim sum, but still enjoyable.  Average service.  Bathrooms smelled like a mix of chlorine and bleach."}
{"text":"Dim Sum... anytime... Every visit. Every Time. Only place you can find the noodle rolls with pork ribs. The shrimp and beef noodle rolls are good too. the noodle is not too thick and cakey. Also has buy one get one free Lobster with noodles. Great deal. about $30 bucks. Tastes way better than Orchid Garden."}
{"text":"I was actually trying to eat at Ichiza in the early afternoon, which is in next building over, but I forgot to check that they actually opened up at 5pm.  Still being guided by my rumbling stomach, I looked at nearby restaurants in Las Vegas' \"Chinatown\".  While walking around, The Love us on Yelp Sticker on Harbor Palace's door caught my eye.  I thought to myself, \"How awesome!!  Another loved yelp spot, the food here must be great!\".  Oh how I was wrong.  Immediately, when I got in there, the atmosphere was dreary, somewhat old fashioned, and a little unkempt.  I then thought, \" Well, maybe all the energy is poured into the excellent food and service, yelp will not let me down!  Again, I was completely wrong.  I started with the noodle dish and BBQed beef, and I ended with those.  I second that prior review, the noodles were both bland, dry, and greasy if you can believe that.  The BBQed beef was damn near all fat too.  I was like \"What the hell?  I didn't remember ordering a big dish of just meat fat.\"  This place needs to be checked out by the restaurant sanitary inspector because it looks a little dirty.  My waitress even brought out a disgusting looking fish bucket to show the table right behind me.  What was that all about?  And to top it off, I waited nearly 20 minutes for the waitress to bring me back a doggy bag.  My bill was 20 or so dollars for some reallyyy crappy food.   I felt ripped off, let down, and regretful I even entered the door with the supposed \"They love us on Yelp\" sticker.  How did they get that sticker?  Did they steal that?  Well, I sure felt that they had just stolen my money.  Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"When we came in, we thought it was a decent place. When the food come in the staff with the dim sum cart were really rude. The food was overprice and some of the food are bland. The chicken feet was so salty. Totally do not reccomend to eat here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Came from a recommendation from a family member. First time having dim sum in Las Vegas. Steamed BBQ pork bao was great. BBQ pork in rice noodle really good. Staff was ok sort of friendly but wasn't expecting much. Might be better for dinner than lunch.  Probably more choices."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The lady ran out asking my dad why he only tipped $5. They're pathetic."}
{"text":"Food off the menu is pricey and not worth it!   Dim Sum is horrible! Reheated in the microwave after a long rancid stay in the carts.   This place used to be good 10 years ago, but I am so over it! Blech!"}
{"text":"We ordered off the menu instead of dim sum. The food was delicious and the service was good. They were attentive, but really tried to sell the dim sum despite us saying no multiple times but I attribute the persistence to cultural differences. I will return. The manager sat at a table and explained almost the entire menu for another party, thought that was pretty cool.  I recommend the rock cod filet with black bean sauce, the fish was like butter."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star I would.  In conclusion  of you want to have decent Chinese food this is definitely not the place. Oh and don't even mention the service. It's the worst I have ever seen.   I have been here many times and each time I give them an excuse for their shitty service like oh they don't understand English, but today is my last straw.   Maybe because of people like me who keep giving them chances that why they are still able to open for business. Well. NEVER AGAIN.   People if you want chinese food. You better off spending your money else where. They are many places near by.   Good luck to whoever that wants to eat here."}
{"text":"Lackluster service with takeout quality food.   My girlfriend and I took her father here. We entered the restaurant and the host was on a personal phone call with her back to the door. We listened to her for a while, then she realized we were there and quickly hung up. We were sat at a table with a dirty table cloth under a pane of glass.   The president was in town and Channel 8 was showing the speech. I asked if they would show the speech on one of the three TVs which were all turned off. The manager said the TVs were reserved for advertising, and turned on one of the TVs to some type of advertising channel which did not show advertisements for the restaurant (think video games and movies.) The other two were not turned on.   The menu has approximately 200 entrees and took a while to read. The servers seemed impatient, and I do mean servers, as we had multiple servers.  We got our appetizer, and the server spilled the sauce on the table. She said, \"Oops,\" but did not clean it. The entrees were not far behind, and the same server set the first dish in the sauce she had spilled.   The food was food, and I cannot say it wasn't. Her dad and I ordered a two person family dinner. It was greasy, bland, and surprisingly poor quality for $15 a person, but it was still food. My girlfriend's hot pot was bad. It was still food too, but she did not enjoy it. We ate until we were full, and then I used the bathroom.  Which brings me to the bathroom. The exterior door was filthy; the kind of filthy which causes you to dread entering the restroom. Think \"behind the gas station in Kingman, AZ\" dirty. Once in the men's restroom, you will find there are two urinals. The one on the left was leaking onto the floor, and the leak spread under the other urinal. This makes it impossible to use without standing in the leak. The leak runs even further under the stalls, and I imagine your pants would get wet if you had to sit on the toilet. The floor was sticky in the dry spots.   We shall never return."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times for both the dim sum (lunch) and dinner. Yes the place is run down.  Extensive menu.  Reasonable prices, especially the dim sum, loved everything.  Had the house special fried rice and sizzling seafood plate last night mmmmm, even the sweetsour chicken I ordered for the kids was good.  Service seemed pretty attentive, we were the only wide-eyes in there :). Will definitely go back for the food/prices."}
{"text":"Horrible service and worst food ever!!!!!!! The lady there served a noncooked pork dim sum to us and yelled at us she knew nothing about it. If they allow 0 star in Yelp, I will definitely do this!!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Eat 24 for delivery. They waited 35 minutes to inform Eat 24 that they don't have a delivery driver. By now it is too late to order delivery from any other Chinese restaurant. It's extremely unprofessional that it took so long to let them know they couldn't deliver. Will never try to order from this place again."}
{"text":"It's in China Town and was busier than any other place in the strip . We decide to try it .... the place overall is dirty , the carpet the tables etc . The food was mediocre but the staff was nice and attentive . Wouldn't come back but I'm accused of being a good snob !"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Wednesday, and there wasn't a wait. I can see why. The carts took FOREVER to come around. The \"servers\" were MIA. Asked for a soda, and it took about 20 minutes to come. The food here is blehhh. The service is nonexistent.... The people rolling the carts, rolled right passed us and didn't even ask if we wanted anything! RIDICULOUS!!!! Probably will never come here again. Sticking to Cathay House!"}
{"text":"The food was alright but some of the foods we ordered were cold and not fresh. Also the plates, chopsticks, and cups looked a little dirty. Later on during our lunch, some other people came into the restaurant and were seated to a table close to us, but they were arguing and the manager didn't do anything about it. Once we were done we paid our check and got our change back out of $40 and they still asked for a tip, which was was very rude. Tips are voluntary and shouldn't be asked for. I paid them a tip even though they didn't deserve it because I'm for sure not going back there again."}
{"text":"Craving dim sum while on our Vegas vaycay, we decided to try this place out. The food is mediocre, service was ehh, and just about the only good thing was the decent pricing. Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but after dining exclusively at Mayflower for all my dim sum needs (maybe it's a Bay thing), Harbor Palace was a let down. The food really tasted little better than the stuff you get from the frozen aisle of the Asian market.  It didn't seem like the cleanest place to eat either.... So skip this place and find another!"}
{"text":"My first impression was how dirty and old the carpet was. I chose Harbor Palace because of convenience. The were able to take a reservation over the phone. But when I showed up, they were not that busy to begin with. So the reservation didn't really help much.  The food was decent, nothing to rave about. Service was ok, very typical for Chinese establishments. They did take a long time to return our CC back to us when we paid the bill, so who knows if it's been compromised. I guess we'll find out in a few weeks.."}
{"text":"This was the worst dim sum ive ever had! Went there for lunch atound 1 pm there food wasnt warm because the lady asked us if we wanted it heated up. We should have just walked out then. There was a hair on the soy sauce container too. Lost our appetite after that. Grocery store dim sum would have been better."}
{"text":"Had dimsum here today, the usual siomai, hagao, spare ribs, chicken feet, sticky rice and veggie dimsum. All for $23.00 and we're very satisfied! Yum."}
{"text":"This place is fairly decent. The dim sum was alright and the service was ok, not very attentive. You are required to  spend a minimum $20 to charge your credit card. Smehhhh... Not impress. No wow factor here for me to come back."}
{"text":"The only gripe I have about this place is the slow service. But other than that, for dinner, the food is pretty good.  I enjoyed the egg flower soup and honey walnut shrimp.  The prices are not that expensive, comparative to the ones in Southern California."}
{"text":"What a shame how dirty this restaurant has become. I think a lot of yelpers are a little harsh on the food. It's fine. A little greasy, but it's OK. Doesn't deserve 1 star. I think the 1 star comes from poor service and how run down it is. The service is worse than a typical Chinese restaurant, but to me it's always been that way. My wife is Chinese and I'm used to the personality. However at seafood harbor it's worse. Seems to be accepted by management if not encouraged. It's a shame. A little clean up, and some lessons in customer service and they might see a real increase in sales"}
{"text":"Came here for dim-sum and the food was good but thats about it. Service was not great, but this is not the type of restaurant that you expect that so it was fine. Really just gets the job done but if you yelp other places, you'll find great alternatives in Vegas as well."}
{"text":"Check your bank statements after paying with card! Went to dinner here and ordered too much.  We called for reinforcements.  Friends didn't show up so we asked to pack up the dinner and for the check.  After they packed everything up they brought out the fortune cookies but no check.  Our friends walk in and we decide to keep them company because they decided to order a few things.  So we share our to go's with them have a nice dinner.  Time for the check again they put it all on one.  Ok no problem let's get this fixed because I'm a receipt keeper. Ohhh they printed out a second receipt looks like from a calculator adding their 20% tip lol hey I don't mind you we're gonna get it anyway.  So now he's arguing with me about how he doesn't know how to do that I explain that I like to keep a record of my card transactions and we were paying with 2 different cards would we be able to each tip.  He said ya ya I'll charge both cards.  Ok whatever I jus want to leave because he's not going to do it I think he was more worried about making sure he gets that 20% tip.  For all that trouble and arguing with me we decided to do a 15% tip.  Well according to the bank statement they took another $10 wow I've never seen that before.  If that $10 was more important than having repeat business keep it.  The food was ok.  The place is dirty they were big dumplings droppings under our table.  The bathroom was disgusting.  I can say I tried it and I'll tell everyone on social media not to go there"}
{"text":"I regularly visit Vegas throughout the year and decided to come in with my family because we were craving Chinese food. We weren't expecting much as it was our first time trying this place out. We were able to indulge in both dim sum and food that can be ordered from a menu. While the food was of average quality, the service was horrible. It took more than 5 people to take our order. It took 30 minutes to get water. And we were left staring at our soup because they served it without bowls for the table. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Best after hours spot to hit up, orange chicken and duck is amazing! We always take our friends here who visit Vegas. Price is affordable!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and My husband and I came here with another couple who likes to come here when they are in town and they said the food was pretty good for authentic Chinese food despite what I read on the reviews from other yelpers. So I checked in with yelp and a nice surprise showed saying we get 20% off our bill. The coupon said in small print from 10pm-2am, it was 9:54pm when we ordered. They had a special for lobster buy one get one free for $48.95 so we ordered the lobster special, seafood soup, snow pea tip and clams in oyster sauce. The soup came out nice and hot but lacked in flavor - it was very bland, the clams was nothing special- taste like any other Chinese restaurant, the snow pea tip was smothered in oil and soggy. The lobster was a disappointment as well, it was more like buy one lobster and get a half lobster free- there were missing pieces to our lobster- we definitely did not get another lobster for free and it was very tiny for the price. The best part was when we asked if we could use our 20% off coupon they said yes and then came back to us and said \"sorry sir you ordered your food at 9:54pm and the coupon starts at 10pm.\" We politely said \"ok no problem, we understand if that's your policy.\" But...really? Does it makes a difference for that 6 mins? It's all about customer service! Let's just say we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my favorite dim sum place in Las Vegas. All the food is always steaming hot and fresh. Prices are reasonable and the service is good with carts coming around regularly. The staff speaks English very well here and can answer any food questions. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"If you're craving dim sum in Vegas, this place in Chinatown is okay. It's not the cleanest; it's kind of dimly lit, but the food is not bad. I received room temperature Shuimai (the crab cakes wrapped in wonton wrappers); NOT a good sign. However, their tofu dessert (Dofuhua) was pretty good. Overall, their food is just average in temperature (never \"fresh\"), taste and price."}
{"text":"Service is good for a Chinese restaurant. Everyone is nice and greets you when you enter and leave. They speak English which was a plus. Dim sum is pricey compared to most places I went to... about $3.80. Servings are small."}
{"text":"This place is so dirty. It's ridiculous. They obviously don't change their table cloths under the glass at the tables after each party leaves because there are sauce stains on most of the table cloths. So gross. Service sucked also.   Don't go to this place unless you want to eat at a dirty ass place."}
{"text":"Dim Sum so sad it will make you cry like a little baby that just had dim sum so bad even a little baby knows it's bad. Waaaaaaaaaa.   If you never ate Dim Sum before you would leave thinking Dim Sum is short for Diminished Sumthing."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was superior. My litmus test for dim sum is shu mai. Harbor Palace dim sum was comparatively larger than most. It was 3 bite shu mai, light on black mushroom and flavor but still good. I also had their tripe and turnips, another good dish if I'd had room I would have had the wine blanched tripe.  It's definitely worth a visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find a female chef showcased on the wall. I'd pass on the noodles and soy sauce. They were dry and unremarkable. Save your stomach real estate for one of their tastier dishes. The staff was really nice and welcoming. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"It smelled very funny inside. Everything we tried to order was very slow coming out or they didn't have it. We ordered dim sum at night. They served everyone else around us even though we were seated first. Overall it was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was headed home from Vegas and was Hangry. I gases up and H.P. Was around the corner.  They were cooking and it smelled great. Sometimes I let my nose make eating decisions for me. Not always a good idea.  This place needs serious cleaning. My shirt was sticking to the chair..............Ewwwwww  Ok, really I felt like getting up and leaving but The Saue Mai was tasty and I was close to death food wise so I stayed............and prayed.  Well I'm still alive n well so as they say. Prayer works.  Ah, I won't be here again. You can if you're a good at praying."}
{"text":"Went there again with some people who had to have dim sum and we were in the chinatown plaza, so I  can tell you nothing but their portion and prices have changed, and not for the better. they continue to recycle food, just watch them when they clear a table, if theres good food left over, they will not throw it away, and will service to someone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So we stopped in here for some Dim Sum Cantonese Style.   After only 2 carts, I was able to get all of my favorites.  I love it because all you have to do is point and they serve it to you. It helps that I speak Cantonese, so I was able to request my favorite, but I can see how this would be frustrating to others who are not familiar with Dim Sum.   Yes, they do have chicken feet.  Unless you can read Chinese, chances are you won't be able to read the check and know exactly how much it will cost you, or know the actual name of the item that you ordered. Meh.  Sometime's I'd rather not know.   I thought this was a great place for Dim Sum, but it certainly is not a good place for Dim Sum beginners without an old Chinese person or a seasoned Dim Sum eater."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place while on the way to another Cantonese restaurant I chose.  My uncle saw it and remembered it from his last visit and decided to go there.  Big mistake (and I guessed he figured that out too, especially after he went to Wing Lei).    The service was not so hot and the food was pretty bad.  I wouldn't want to go back at all.  There was just nothing to say good about this place perhaps except that the people were trying to be nice (even though they didn't really know how)."}
{"text":"Lousy food.  Tasteless Wonton soup and Peking Duck with greasy soft leathery skin.  Avoid the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible sweet and sour sauce that smelled like steak sauce.   MY FRIENDS FORTUNE COOKIE DIDNT EVEN HAVE A FORTUNE IN IT!! Haha no fortune at this place.    Only reason they are getting 2 stars is because my lemonade was made in house which was the only thing I enjoyed here."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was Good and the price was meh. When they saw us order alot of food they gave us a dish of fried rice for FREE!!! When you check in you get one free egg roll. THEY GAVE US THREE!!!! The waiters were nice and told us alot of info about the food. There is a lot of space to maneuver and get food at ease. I recommend you to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes the food experience was very good. Dim sum plus menu items. Plenty of star to help You in every way. Tofu dish was excellent. Recommend if I China Town enjoy this Chinese stop!"}
{"text":"It's nothing to be wowed about but for a decent price you get your dim sum fix fast. The service has always been good for me. The people were nice and always gave you ice water without asking.  It's not dim sum from San Francisco so if you come in not expecting that, it's not too bad at all."}
{"text":"When ever I visit Las Vegas, I will definitely come here for my Dim Sim fix. The Dim Sum here is of high quality Hong Kong style. Order the Chow Mien.  It's full of flavour.   Prices are reasonable. And the Service is good."}
{"text":"Place is a old, foods were ok, not enough servers working for this Thanks Giving holiday dim sum. Waited a long time for everything. Servers were not very happy keep saying sorry too busy. We didn't even get our hot mustard sauce we asked for when we just sat down. :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious Delicuous Delicious!!! The roasted duck was a dream!!! Great servings and we live that all the plates are shareable portions. We're from out of town, but if we come back, we're coming here! So good!"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant in Chinatown.  Best for dinner and especially late night, dim sum is OK considering it is Las Vegas. Our favorite is the fish porridge, in general they are a safe bet.  Price is very reasonable considering this is Vegas and you are 5 minutes from the strip.  Surprised that they get rated so low, well we know what we like."}
{"text":"Dim sum is not the best here and dinner entrees are on the ok side.   A lot of tourist go here because it's the only dim sum restaurant in the China Town/strip area, so on weekends, it can get busy.  Late night dining is available. A few times, I ordered the won ton noodle soup-that was good!"}
{"text":"Fast service i order the lobster dish with noodles buy one get one free awesome and it was good I will be back to try some dim sum !!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great we will definitely be back again and again and again! They also have a late night menu that looks good too! We ordered the family dinner B. Everything was perfect! 5 stars"}
{"text":"I hate giving 1 star, but the place is dirty!  YUCK YUCK YUCK!  I hate finding this out after I ate, but that's when I went to the restroom and wish I hadn't seen all the dirt on the walls, floors and I could see into the kitchen, YIKES!  Where's Kitchen Nightmares?  The food, tasted OK, but nothing super or special.  The service was quick and good.  But I can't get over the place being DIRTY!  YUCK YUCK YUCK....ICKY POO POO!  NONONONO Not again...."}
{"text":"This is always our favorite food stand at the Chinatown Plaza's Chinese New Year celebration, which we have been attending for the past nine years. We love their dim sum dishes; everything is tasty, perfectly cooked, and the variety is wonderful. Prices are very reasonable, so we order a little of everything and are never disappointed. We are planning on going to the actual restaurant soon:)"}
{"text":"It was ridiculous! Came in at 9:00 just wanted their steam rice noodle rolls, but the owner said it won't be ready until 9:30. I came back again around 10:00 and ordered steam rice noodle rolls and cup of Hot soy milk take out. It took around 5 mins to get me the rice noodle rolls which is reasonable; however, after 25 mins later, they brought me a COLD soy milk where they got from their refrigerator (I saw it), REALLY?! The lady told me it is \"warm\". PISSED ME OFF completely and won't come again!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars. Servers were miserable and unfriendly and the place was absolutely filthy! And I just looked and found them on dirty dining. I couldn't believe how disgusting it was. Don't eat there!"}
{"text":"AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! If you want yummy tasting dim sum or Chinese food!  If you're in the area, go up stairs and eat at Pho Vietnam instead. It'll be so worth it, believe me.   For my first and last visit, I went with a group of 8 and we were literally only there for not even 15 minutes.   Food - ordered dimsum, all tasted off or bland.   Service - ***BEWARE of the owner/manager...if you don't leave tip, she will ask for tip. That's the first time I ever heard anyone from an establishment question you why you didn't leave a tip. Tip is voluntarily and we weren't happy with the service or food, so you're not entitled to leave extra money. Smh.  Place - out dated and dusty."}
{"text":"WhooooEverrr... gave them more than 1 star you should be ashamed of yourself!..  the dim sum was horrible.. I am in from LA and driving around looking for Chinese food.. didn't want to do any more food on the strip.. My friend and I had to do some shopping so we went to Chinatown.. wanted the usual hole in the wall place.... someone come help me just dig them a hole back to China...who is with me on this...?!. the best thing there was the steamed Chinese broccoli...  If I am in the hospital and in a coma from food poisoning, let them know that I ate here..... please pray for me"}
{"text":"I had a craving for dim sum during one of my regular weeklong vegas trips, and i've tried other restaurants in the strip mall this place resides, so we gave it a go.  The dining room is pretty rundown and the tables and chairs looked like they had been through the ringer a couple times.    On to the food.  The carts zipped around pretty quickly, and i was pleasantly surprised that the service was clutch.  I was seated furthest away from the carts so i had to get up every time to see what they had.  Despite that, good service i must say.  I will list the foods (some with my patented terrible description) that i liked and didn't like:  Likes: -chicken feet - i like to eat these things, but i think it's cooler to watch other peoples' grossed-out expressions when i do eat them -smelt - surprisingly flavorful -spare rib - tender and tasty -shrimp dumpling - basic but good -the flat thing that tasted like shrimp and looked like an egg, also good  Drinking haterade: -all egg rolls were bland and blech -calamari just ok -the steam rolls i had were kinda cold and blech -other dumplings we ordered (not shrimp), take a pass  So some good and not so good things here, thus my useless 3 star rating.  I will continue my vegas dim sum search to other places, though i may come back here."}
{"text":"Sunday night for dinner here and it's a joke.   The restaurant is very run down and outdated.   Service? HA! I could have served myself. It's ridiculous, unprofessional and annoying. We've waited 40 mins for our food. I asked our server what's taking our food so long and she said it's crowded tonight. No it's not. Half the restaurant is full.   Food was just mediocre, not even good plus it didn't even give the runs so it's not too bad.  Nothing impressive."}
{"text":"This restaurant was better than what people reviewed. Good service, decent food, very affordable, and some what clean.  You are in the Chinese restaurant. Don't look for super clean."}
{"text":"Last time a year ago told myself I will not be back, food didn't taste fresh. I had the roasted duck, I can clearly see it was not fresh and taste like it was reheated. hai gow tastes old. I recall I can smell a foul scent coming from the restroom as I entered.   During this visit my friends suggested to have dim sum before our drive home.  We followed them from behind, as we patiently waited to  signal  to turn into the parking lot. I told my husband \"No!, not here\".  My supportive husband all he can do was laugh. Here I am dragging myself to get out the car and hubby tugging me along. Yup! still dirty nasty carpet, this time I didn't get a whiff of the bathroom smell. We were greeted by two friendly staff at the front door.   My friends did all the ordering, there were 7 of us they each pointed / asked what they want from the dim sum cart. I decline my request. kept thinking why am I back here again. Than reality hits me. its because for the company of great friendship.  I ate the steamed Chinese broccoli, fried garlic snow pea leaves. it was good. Decided to try the hai gow again, yes! still taste rotten, old meat. the chicken feet was ok? we all thought it lacked flavors.  5 of 7 had the same thought the  fried chicken wings were really salty, it was left unfinished. My girlfriend whispered to me she didn't like the hai gow \" it taste spoiled\".  3 stars for the service provided and giving us a chance to connect with one another. The next time someone recommend this place again. I will slap them silly."}
{"text":"3 months ago I came here and to my suprise the food that I order tasted different and the soup was tasteless. I found out that all the cooks when back to China and hired new cooks. Stay away guys the place sucks now"}
{"text":"Dont let the lady scare you while first seating yourselves while she shouts asking what type of drinks you would like to order, LOL. The glass door was left open and my dinner pal became pretty uncomfortable with the cool breeze heading in our table direction. I went ahead and closed the glass door while my dinner pal was in the restroom. Several hosts placed pickled cabbage as an appetizer and left us with a teapot with green tea. Once I checked in on yelp this place offered 1 free egg roll. Out of the three of us with ordering: orange peeled chicken, roasted duck, scrambled shrimp/egg, fried scallop rice ranged to be around $50."}
{"text":"The best ever I recomend every family go and try this original Chinese restaurant the best noodles"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the rest of the dim sum scene is like in LV, but I thought this place was pretty good. We waited about 5 minutes for a table on Sunday around noon and although the dining room is pretty small compared to the giant places in SoCal, it was pretty packed. There was a decent selection and I found all my favorites including a few new ones like the roast pork. I just wish they had one of those carts that grilled up the radish cakes instead of putting them in the steamer.   The 4 of us ate until we were stuffed and the bill was only $32! I think this is a great option when you've had enough with the buffets and just want something different. Plus they're open from 10 AM to 5 AM which is crazy, even by San Gabriel Valley standards!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas for a week and like true Asians we started to crave Chinese food. We heard from a local that this place served awesome dim sum. The next time I meet up with her in NYC, I am bringing her straight to Flushing or Chinatown so that she can compare the difference. Despite the service being prompt and friendly, the quality of the dim sum just could not meet my expectations. The zha liang was not crispy and the sauce for the Xia Chang Fen was pouring more fluidly than our tea. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad. I enjoyed the meal and it did not break the bank. However, if you truly want to experience great dim sum, travel out of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Chinese food.  Big portions. Very tasty.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my go-to late night chinese food fix restaurant. usually order salt n pepper shrimp (no head, no shell) or salt n pepper pork chops or Mongolian beef or beef broccoli or beef chow fun or I dont know what else. But I of all the times I've eaten here, never had any bad food. Everything tasted good and since we were there late, never had a problem with service. I recommend this place for dinner anytime."}
{"text":"Une adresse que nous aimons! Service rapide, plats copieux pour un prix raisonnable. Pour deux personnes 32$, 1/2 canard rôti, un riz cantonais poisson salé et un plat de légumes variés sautés et un plat de eggs roll offert par Offre spéciale Yelp ! Que du bonheur avec un bon thé chaud,  vraiment bien. L'ambiance est simple et confortable,  le restaurant a été agréablement rénové.  Un restaurant ou nous reviendrons à chacun de nos passages à Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was pretty mediocre and service stinks. They seem to rush you thru everything from seating you to serving you dim sum.  I will definitely not return to this place."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service, good food. The only thing is they don't give us more sweet and sour sauce hahaha. The prices are good and it's a lot of food. It's good for late dining they close at 5am"}
{"text":"The dim sum is good but the waiter service is not great at all. The wait time was absurd because we waited 20 minutes but there were many tables available. The dim sum service was not good because the waiter would not listen to us and would ignore us. Overall I would rate the service a 4/10. Plus, the ambience is good but you can hear a lot of noises in the kitchen which distracts the restaurant setting."}
{"text":"Didn't try the dim sum. I had a hot pot instead. A few points:  Rice is extra, only 80 cents, but extra all the same. Not a place you go to for that chinese dinner combo with the soup and egg roll included.  Not particularly clean.  $20 min for credit cards. All things I expect in a more traditional chinese restaurant.  At any rate, bean curd and mushroom hot pot was actually quite good.  I didn't see any carts going around with dim sum, so I wasn't able to try any, or maybe I was supposed to ask for a special menu? I don't know, but I'd like to come back and try the dim sum next."}
{"text":"Servers were great but the food was gross. Chicken was over cooked and the shrimp had a strange taste. The dim sum was the worse part. Every part I tried tasted old. I love seafood and Chinese food so I thought this would be the perfect place. I was wrong."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. Honestly, I left happy with my meal. I wasn't expecting much since I have had dim sum all my life and this place is in Nevada. The fact that it is located in Chinatown was a little concerning since I tend to think overrated and Chinatown, but this strip on Chinatown was crazy jam packed with Asian restaurants. The decor is very typical dim sum restaurant and is also very typical Chinese service. FYI, the bathroom is not good, so if you can hold off, you should.  The food:  Churn Fun with Shrimp- The crepe was more thick noodle like but still had good flavor. It was good.  Churn Fun with Spare Ribs- Similar to the above but I was expecting the spare ribs to be more tender. The flavor was good.  Pie Kwat- This spare rib is the same as the above, good flavor but needed to be more tender.  Don Tot- I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the egg tart, this is a must get.  Sesame Ball with Lotus Paste- I never get this but a member of my group ordering it and it was great. The outer dough had a perfect chew and the lotus paste had a nice sweetness and nice smooth consistency. Highly recommend.  Bell Pepper with Shrimp Paste- It was good but not a terribly exciting dish.  Dow Meow- or Snow Pea Leaf for $15.95. I really liked the flavor, it is pricey but this is the same price as New York but it was flavorful and tender. I would get this again.   Pork Congee with Thousand Year Egg- It was respectable, the flavor is subtle but the pork and egg adds nice flavor.  Braised Tofu Skin- These seemed on the small side but the flavor was decent.  Shumai- This was bad, it was dry and grainy, I would totally skip this. This was the only thing that I really didn't like, everything else was good or really good."}
{"text":"The food and service are just OK here, but the prices are pretty cheap.  My boyfriend and I had some dim sum dishes and shared the Kung Pao Chicken.  The bill was under $30.  So, we paid a modest amount for a very average meal.  Go here if you are on a tight budget, particularly if you have lost at the casinos."}
{"text":"First impressions. This place is dark, dank, and depressing. Inattentive customer service, even allowing for lowered expectations for a Chinese restaurant. Waitress checking her watch as we order. Dim Sum average at best. Or at least what we were able to try. After our initial order, the carts just powered past us and our outstretched arms. No more for you round eye! Do yourself a favor and research dishes here on YELP before visiting. Know there are six pages of Chinese language menu and very rudimentary English descriptions."}
{"text":"dim sum is great quality... the place is nice.  We always have a great experience with the restaurant. We recommend it because we always come here for good food and experience."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. I went with four of my friends and we patiently sat and waited for somebody to take our order for 15 minutes. When the women finally came up she said \"what do you want\" and when the second person started to order she said \"hurry up I don't have all night\" we waited probably a half hour for our food and they just never brought out two of the plates. And when we asked about them the guy rolled his eyes and came back 10 minutes later with them. When we went up front to pay our waitress walked up to us and said \"where's my tip, gimme tip\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If that's how you think you run a business you're very wrong. I have no problem tipping for good service, but after that night you all don't deserve a penny"}
{"text":"As the only Chinese food place that came up on Uber Eats I ordered a pretty serious amount of food - not only did it take over an hour, but it's so bad it's completely inedible.  It's pretty hard to mess up pot stickers and friend rice. It somehow they managed."}
{"text":"Was craving some dim sum so went for dim sum on a Sunday after noon around 130pm.  I'm from Maryland so we have some decent  dimsum I'm places. This is probably not as good as back in maryland. If u could I would give it 2.5 stars. They have dim sum on carts. We tried the typical dim sum foods. We had har gow, siu mai, chiu chow fun gwor, rice wrapped in banana leaf, shrimp crepes (??), spare ribs, shrimp balls...The best things to get here was the fried shrimp balls, spare rib, siu mai, and rice wrapped in banana leaf. The rest was so so. The biggest disappointment was the har gow. The thin was too thick. Should be crystal like and shrimp flavorful. There was no flavor. Service wasn't bad. Restaurant wasn't too busy so the carts came around quite often. Had to ask for water refills though."}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad, food is very good. This place is one of the few places in town that does daily dim sum, so i've been here quite a few times. Lots of ultra traditional dishes, so be sure you know what you're ordering or you may be in for a surprise."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the only reason anyone comes here is because it's the only thing available at 3AM. The food is terrible. Terrible. I repeat..terrible. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible...been going here for many years, always for Dim Sum.  This place has been slowly going down hill but today was the final straw.  Service was horrible.  Selection was even worse...they had one steam cart and one fried cart for the entire place.  The steamed ones were dry and waaayyyyy over done.  Definitely go someplace else."}
{"text":"It's a great place for late night after hours and you suddenly crave that dimsum. The place is big, a lot of seats, servers are friendly and food is made fresh since it takes a while when you order. It does hit the spot, and prices are acceptable. I do recommend people to visit the place. I do have another favorite spot, but this is acceptable for me if the other one is closed."}
{"text":"It's sad when you go to eat dim sum and they don't even have the basics. I've been eating dim sum for over 30 years of my life and never once have I ever been treated as rudely and as disrespectful as I was treated here. Me and my mother and my sister came here to eat one morning and we were greeted with the most rudest of attitudes. When we asked one of the servers that was pushing a cart around did she have certain things we don't serve that here in a rude and nasty tone. We asked our server for basic condiments such as hot mustard chili and she got an attitude with us. Overall to put the icing on the cake I brought it to Management's attention about the rudeness and the lack of customer service and basically got Shrugged off did not receive an apology no type of discount. So for all you out-of-towners that come looking for good dim sum I would not recommend this place at all. Going forward me and my family will take our business elsewhere since you guys do not know how to treat customers with the respect. So for all use that are reading this please never eat here or go here unless you just want rude and bad service and maybe after they read this I'll finally get an apology for the rudeness that me and my mother and my sister experience there."}
{"text":"The setting was definelty shady with the dim lights. The waitress was kind of rushing us to buy more food and told my dad the wrong price for the fish. She said $20, but it was actually $25. In addition, she seemed really hesitant to give me the free egg rolls, which I found odd. The food was above average for a Chinese restaurant and the food was mediocre. But it's alright, I give then a 2 star because of the old lady gave us good service and tip them $11."}
{"text":"They have a banner outside stating \"Best Chinese in Vegas - 2015\"  What a lie.  Worst meal I had in Vegas, worst dim sum I've ever had, and they charged me $17 for the 2 plates I tried, but couldn't finish because they were COLD. Ponder that statement: Cold food in Vegas in June."}
{"text":"Although i have been here a few times, my last visit for dinner here was so bad that i dont think I will ever go again. Some of the dishes had no salt...few of them were extremely salty. Overall it was crappy. Their dim sum is ok."}
{"text":"This place has changed over the years or do they not serve good food unless its the weekend.  We came on a Monday with a large group for dim sum. The shui Mai was ok. The dumplings were ok. The pork ribs were ok. The rice congee was ok. The steamed shrimp with rice noodles were day old that were warmed up with watered down soy sauce. It was gross. The chicken feet were cooked in a vinegar sauce and that was awful. The shrimp ball was old tasting too.  They use to be very good for dim sum but what happened? I feel bad but it must of been the case of the Monday's. lol. Don't think I will return for dim sim here. :("}
{"text":"We usually stop for dim sum here every time we are in Vegas.  The restaurant is in China town and has plenty of parking.  They serve dim sum every day!  The dim sum selection is excellent...they have special items like fried smelt when available.  Everything has been very good except maybe the beef tendons which I normally love.  The prices are great.  The service can be a little hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME -LY HORRIBLE! I honestly wished I drove the extra mile and went to Cathay House.  This visit will actually keep me from returning.  Dim sum selection were very minimal.  Wait time for drinks was bad.  And when I asked for a specific dim sum the lady looked at her cart and took off without answering my question! WTH!  So with that being said... happy eatings!... else where! :D"}
{"text":"We're driving around looking for dim sum restaurant and we found harbor palace restaurant . First one lady come out point us to the table , when we about to sit another lady tell us to go to different table can hold eight person and our family had 9 adults and two kids . Dim sum restaurant but they said they don't have shrimp dumplings , and everything els taste like they made from yesterday , bad service , bad food ."}
{"text":"I came here with my family of 4. we came at 9:50 am and there were 2 tables already here. Right when we sat down they asked us what to drink and rushed us to pick our dim sum before we even poured our tea. My dad asked to give us a second to drink our tea first and the staff started giving us attitude. They neglected us and we're talking to each other (a lot of cussing btw).  The food was the usual but extra strong in MSG and starch. my spareribs and cow stomach was covered in starch. small portions for expensive price. I won't recommend anyone to come."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything good about this place. The dim sum dishes were tasteless and cold. The servers were also very rude and had a bad attitude when asked for anything."}
{"text":"i cant eat seafood so i cant say how the seafood was but my friends loved it and it was a place they wanted to go so it was a great meal. i was able to eat some beef and pork dim sum dishes and they were good. i also ordered orange chicken and it was pretty good not the best ive had but it was good for 10$. service was fast here on the food side, i did have to tell someone consistently we needed drinks. lol we were eating before we had water. all in all this place is pretty good and located in a great area. if you're a tourist which most people will be this place is located in an asian mall area and if you need some souvenirs walk in the mall and just shop at the little stores, anime galore! haha"}
{"text":"We come here almost every year when we make our annual trip for a basketball tournament. They advertise that they have dim sum everyday, but we always go for dinner. Restaurant hours are certainly accommodating to late-night gamblers: 10 AM - 5 AM. They have a couple of separate banquet rooms which can accommodate large groups -- hopefully you won't need one at the same time a tour bus pulls in.  On our latest trip, we had: fish fillet with black bean sauce, string beans with minced meat, shrimp w/ lobster sauce, deep fried salted & spicy squid, the house special chow mein, orange peel chicken, and eggplant w/ garlic sauce hotpot.  The good: the string beans were fresh & crisp, and the eggplant hotpot was very tasty. The Hong Kong-style chow mein was very good as well.  The bad: fried squid was unremarkable and the chicken in the orange peel chicken was tough & chewy.  The ugly: the fish fillet w/ black bean sauce & the shrimp w/ lobster sauce both had way too much brown/white onion. The shrimp w/ lobster sauce had only six shrimp, and the lobster sauce had pieces of pork, which is something I haven't seen before. The flavor for both dishes was good, but just not enough fish or shrimp in each.  Overall, the food is probably pretty good for Las Vegas as far as being authentically Chinese, but the quality of some dishes isn't as good as you'd find in a community with a large Chinese population (i.e., LA or SF)."}
{"text":"Their selection of dim sum wasn't as large or there want much of a selection.  Had to order the Chinese broccoli since it didn't come out on the cart. The pork potstickers had no taste so we didn't finish eating it.  They didn't really understand English either.  Wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Go to McDonald's or Taco Bell. The bad reviews here are true. My taxi cab driver told me this was the best Chinese Food in Las Vegas. I didn't believe him of course but I thought that it would be an authentic Chinatown experience. I specifically did not read any online reviews prior to going, thinking that if it wasn't the best, it would be average, good Chinese food. The space itself is fine. The entire staff is disorganized but no one was rude. The menu is primitive, long, and confusing. They need to be thrown out and redone. The quality of the food was uniformly poor. We ordered the #3 dinner special. They put out very bad appetizers and soup and forgot about the entree. I didn't eat the chicken or shrimp because they looked disgusting. I couldn't bring myself to snap a photo because I thought that I would gag if I looked at it. The fried rice had some visible lard on it. Just to sum it up, the service is confused (in a big way) and really bad food. They were not busy when I went and I did not try the dim sum. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Food is okay if you like seafood .... Potions are not bad. Scallop tofu and whole steam fish and crab/lobster noddle special are good!"}
{"text":"We come here with my cousin from Calgary who was visiting. I did not check out reviews before I came here, we were kind of in a hurry to find a place for dinner so I suggested this place. They have dim sum everyday, and hours are from 10 AM - 5 AM. They have banquet rooms which can accommodate large groups.  We had quite a few variety which I don't remember. Large selections on the menu.  The server did not understand much english. Overall, I thought the food was good."}
{"text":"Good service.  Always consistent.  Its irritating seeing others bash it.  If their expectations are THE PALM then pay THE PALM prices."}
{"text":"Friends and I sometimes make an early morning \"dinner\" here after a night dancing in Goldcoast. As it is convenient and still open until 5 a.m. (from 10a.m. for 7 days of the week). There is no wait to get seated. The host sits us on any table we prefer on either table setting or booth-type seating. Sometimes,a few or no diners at this hours of early morning. Food service is quick to moderate wait.   Noticeably, the menu have Chinese characters as well as below the English food titles are Filipino language translations. Is it because the owners are also of Filipino heritage or is it that the restaurant's dining patrons are predominantly Filipino? Interesting.  A wide variety of entree in the menu consisting of appetizer, soup, various seafood entrees (shark's fin, abalone, sea cucumber, lobster, crab, geoduck clam, scallop, shrimp, clam, oyster, squid, fish), various fowl entrees (squab, duck, chicken), beef, pork, vegetable, bean curd, fried rice, hot pot, sizzling plate, noodle entrees. Spicy Items are indicated. The usual soup I order each time I dine here is \"Fish Maw with Crab Meat Soup\" which is filled with fish and crab meat in a flavorful thickened broth. Hot Pots are generous and steaming hot. Oyster is also another favorite item ordered which are large-sized. Never overcooked.   Family Dinner Combinations are also available starting from $12.95 - $17.95. A Special Lunch menu served 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays to Fridays Only at $5.95 is a good deal to have which includes soup of the day, an egg roll and fried rice. Sometimes, this is an order I make when in the vicinity of \"Chinatown\", conveniently packed in a styrofoam box on a take-out request.  Just not expect quick attention to your needs, the servers seem to be preocuppied with something else when you need to get their service."}
{"text":"The food was not too bad, but the service was practically non-existent. It took so long for someone to come take our order we almost left. We had to flag down a server for anything we needed after. Maybe it was a little busy but maybe stop by to check on diners at some point? I have literally had better service at some fast food places. When wait staff did interact with us, it was perfunctory and made us feel like we were imposing on them. Looking around the restaurant, not even a smile to attempt to make diners feel welcome. The food like I said was pretty good but the experience will keep me from returning or recommending. There are too many options in Las Vegas to put up with that again."}
{"text":"Its a pretty typical chinese seafood restaurant. Been to worse been to better. One comment is that their food is way too salty for my taste buds and i can taste alot of mag used in the process. The service was decent as well. I can see that they are trying but some are inexperienced waiters... Took like 15 mins after we sat down to get our order taken. But if you really want some chinese food, its not a terrible option."}
{"text":"This place is open till 5am but I'm not sure if it's the best time to try out their food. Our big bowl of jook didn't have much preserved egg and the shredded pork in it was rather dry. The texture of the porridge was on the thinner side and had an odd anise flavor.  Dry fried beef ho fun was on the oily side and the noodles seemed more al dente than they should be.  On choy was nicely cooked and seasoned very well, my favorite dish."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie. Unfortunately I didn't yelp fast enough before my family walked in and got seated. Service is awful and I know that's expected but it was even worse than I imagined. These ladies walk up to your table expressionless and speechless as if you can see through the damn tin dishes to order from their cart. A staring contest ensues until you ask... So what do you have? After a while, the ladies started flashing some smiles and we noticed it was because they were looking at our infant son. So if you want slightly friendlier service, bring a baby with you.   Food was \"passable\" as my hubby put it. He liked the chive and pork dumplings and not much else. I was taught to leave with at least one positive thought, so hmm... Egg tarts came out hot and fresh as we were about to leave, so that made up for the experience a teeny tiny bit. Also, the person who brought us our check who may or may not have been the owner, was super duper friendly and sweet. She said \"please join us again soon!\" She gave us some coupon and commented on how cute the kids were. Okay, I shall give you TWO stars."}
{"text":"Traditional style chinese restaurant, located in its own place at the edgr of vegas chinatown. Decor is plain and old, as well as the china. But some of our best meals have been in these types of places so we gave it a shot.  Service - Waitress didn't even give us two minutes to sit down before she asked what we wanted to order. We had to call her away 3 times since we were still looking at the menu... she could benefit from a lesson in learning body language. We ordered 6 things, only 5 came out. Which was good in the long run because it was too much food anyways.   Seafood soup bit salty but decent. Chewy.   Sweet and sour fried fish was done very well. Crispy fresh fishsteaks drizzled with yummy sauce. Similar taste to squirrel fish.   General Tso chicken (my banana sister wanted this) tasted exactly like a mediocore replica of the fish dish above, except with dry chicken pieces. Disappointing.  Veggies - they ran out of the ones we wanted so we tried asking about a different type (but very popular) mushroom dish. They looked confused and did not understand, maybe from a different part of china? We did not get what we wanted, but a much slimier kind of mushroom.   Chow Fun (seriously I dont know why my parents let her choose the menu so american) - very oily, HeFuns were pieces rather than long strands, making it difficult to eat.   Decent seafood but mediocore in everything else. Almost no other chinese in the restaurant, probably should have known. Oh well."}
{"text":"Their foods are really shitty, I got food poisoning here and I can't even stop throwing up and shitting like AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU CAN"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Charged us for a soda we never got then when I said something when we got the bill they just minus the cost of the soda not the tax. I left no tip because we didn't get any service. We had to call someone to take our order we had to actually had to get up to get the bill and other than dropping the food off at our table we saw no one. The food was just ok and I have never ordered spare ribs before and got them boiled with nothing left on the bone. A waste of $40 for just two people."}
{"text":"This is a dim sum review only.  Sis and I were craving us some dim sum on Sunday morning in Las Vegas.  The hotel recommended Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant because \"many of our guests liked it\".  I'm not sure if their guests had much experience with dim sum because our meal was pretty disappointing.  Not that I've got that much experience with dim sum, but...  First of all, I love Las Vegas.  The city originally didn't have a Chinatown.  No problem!  They built a couple of strip malls on Spring Mountain Road and slapped pagoda roofs on them and asian businesses set up shop.  Now there is a proliferation of chinese, thai, korean and some japanese shops, bakeries and restaurants along Spring Mountain.  if you build it, they will come!  Harbor Palace is a large restaurant in (I think) one of the original strip malls.  The interior is very basic restaurant decor, without much in the way of fancy wall hangings or artistic pieces that you see in some Chinese restaurants.  But basic is okay and sometimes a good thing, if the food is good.  Sis and I were seated by the hostess and  served a lo mein dish (not sure if this is complimentary or not, more later).  We were being eyeballed by three cart ladies, who were standing with their dim sum carts a few feet away from our table.  After we have been sitting for a few minutes, each cart lady rolls her cart out of our area and disappears. The carts looked pretty full before they left so I don't know if they were serving other tables or reloading or what. By the time they get back to us and we've chosen our food, items are lukewarm at best.  The shiumai and the steamed wontons tasted pretty similar and everything was dry.  The steamed barbecue pork buns were okay but not hot.  There were a coiuple of other things that were fine but nothing that really stood out.  We passed on the chicken feet and porridge and ribs.  There were also other choices, such as seseme steamed buns and rice, but it didn't seem like a vast amount of choices.  We finished up quickly and got out after paying the bill which seemed reasonable but it was all in Chinese, so I'm not sure exactly what we got or whether the noodles we had were added to the bill.   Next time we will do a little more research, instead of relying on what \"other guests\" liked ."}
{"text":"It's a shame. The food was great but the management is a joke, and the service is non existent. We ordered one of their select combinations which includes an appetizer, soup, rice, and a couple proteins. We ordered one consisting of beef and chicken. Turns out they dropped off someone else's entree to our table. No one said what the dish was or even bothered to stop back by until the other table questioned the where abouts of their food. Management came to my table insisting I pay for the dish we didn't order or eat. It wasn't even the correct dish for the other table. There's plenty of places in the area with good food as well, but it be a task to find a place with such poor etiquette as Harbor Palace.  Dine else where!"}
{"text":"Definitely wait to come here after 11:30 a.m. If you arrive early like I did at 10:45 a.m. everything they're serving isn't fresh. The first 3-4 dishes we ate were cold and disappointing. But once they start pushing around the fresh dim sum carts, the food is pretty decent. Just keep your expectations low and do not order the Wonton Noodle Soup (it's not worth the $7). I wouldn't eat here again if I could help it, supposedly there are better dim sum places in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was some serious good eating! I wasn't aware of Vegas' dim sum scene, but this place offers simple, traditional, tasty and pretty good service of dim sum for the area. The prices are very reasonable!   They have the little push carts that go around and that's a rareity to see these days in many of the new dim sum tea houses. It does help to speak the language (Cantonese or Mandarin), as the ladies on the carts will be more attentive to what you want to try or eat.   We ordered the usual items like ha gor (shrimp dumpling), siu mai, steamed pork bun, chicken feet (yes!), pork ribs, congee with preserved duck egg and some other items.  We fed a party of 3 for only $40 - not bad! And, we were full at the end of our meal.   The decor is a bit old school, so don't expect to be wow-ed by the restaurant's looks. Parking can be tough on the weekends, but there is a big lot. You just have to drive around a bit to find a spot. Otherwise, this place is a steal.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"pros... one of the few dim sum places we found in las vegas.  i'm sure there were more, but this one was the one we went to.  close to the strip, lots of parking, a big aquarium with a few gold fish, somewhat helpful waitresses.    now about the food.  i would come here mostly for the steamed foods.  so the har gaw, pork shumai, cha shu baos, and the steamed rolls.  the egg custard tart was also so good.  the only fried item on the list that made it was the fried sesame balls, which we only tried the yellow bean one, cause they do offer a black bean sesame oblong as well.  the best thing was the sweet silken tofu dessert, which was spot on, and is probably the best tasting, well syrup wise, that i have had.  it was smooth, light, soft and very warm.  the syrup was just the right sweetness without being too sweet, and the ginger taste was perfect.     cons... well where should i begin.  well the place was a bit run down, carpets need a steaming, the chairs and tables were also very run down.   neon sign not working, and the windows were pretty greasy.    the wait staff must have been afraid of me and the wife with the boxes of chinese herbal medicines on the table, or were they just ignoring us for the first 10 minutes.  but then they came by and it was good from there.    the fried foods were disappointing, egg rolls were soggy, no sauce with them.  fried noodles also no sauce to accompany them.  somewhat a bit greasy with the fried foods, sounds wrong but if you fry things correctly you get very light and relatively oil free foods.  think of a good tempura, which is light and not greasy at all.  enough said.  all in all just a 3 star place.  when i go back in november i'm finding the other dim sum place in las vegas."}
{"text":"Stereotypical Cantonese style Chinese food.   Came here for late night dinner one night with family and friends. It was the only restaurant open in this plaza after 11pm. We were seated right away and the manager came over right away and took our order. We ordered about 6 dishes to share between 5 of us.   The food came out really quickly, and everything tasted very authentic, a bit greasy and salty though. The dishes are medium to smaller portions compared to the normal size at chinese restaurants, and the prices are higher as well. The service was quick but absent at times.   Nothing fancy, just fill up when you are hungry."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is the best t tasting I  have had in Vegas! Seriously y'all, try it!"}
{"text":"The ONE star rating this place earned is for the non-smoking atmosphere.  And that's it!!  The bench seat was missing the back half (where your butt & tailbone would touch) of the padding, so the seat was lumpy and had a steep decline.  VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!!  I had to go to my car to get a blanket, roll it up lengthwise, and fill in the crevice so we could eat comfortably.  The ONLY reason why I didn't just get up & leave, which I would have done had it been with other company, was that my 73-year-old aunt wanted to eat here & out of respect, I didn't complain to her.  (I waited to do it here)  Plus she paid.  That was the first bad experience.  The second came when we were greeted at the table rather blankly by our waitress.  Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe that was her personality, whatever; still didn't make my experience any better.  Yes, my aunt has a strong accent, but the waitress couldn't figure out what exactly she wanted even after I tried to explain (I have a North American accent & spoke slowly & articulated my words).  I think my aunt got the food she wanted.  3rd bad experience:  The crab rangoon had curry in it!!  I made crab rangoon before & could have sworn it doesn't have curry in it.  The waitress looked at us through slitted eyes & said that's how they normally make it (curry was not mentioned in the menu).  So I double checked a few websites, and sure enough, NO CURRY in a traditional crab rangoon recipe!  I looked at allrecipes.com, chinesefood.about.com, and damndelicious.net.  My sister told them to take it back, that we didn't want it.  Since our aunt paid the bill, we didn't get to see it (actually forgot to check) to make sure the 2 orders of crab rangoon was taken off the bill.  I hope so.  4th bad experience:  Waited A LLLOOOONG time, each time, to get checked on and for a water refill.  This is even before the crab rangoon incident.  Can't blame it on revengeful, horrendous service.  5th bad experience:  The breaded shrimp is WAY TOO BREADED!!!  When we removed the breading, it almost tripled the size of the shrimp that was lost inside.  6th bad experience:  Price for and taste of food were at opposite ends of the spectrum!!  Guess which ends they belong?  I don't eat at McDonald's anymore, but I know McDonald's food tastes A LOT BETTER!  Needless to say, we will NOT return.  I'm noticing a few one-star reviews to my right as I write this.  I'll steer my auntie somewhere else next time we visit her.  And my sister or I will pay!   THIS IS THE **WORST** RESTAURANT MY SISTER AND I HAVE VISITED!!!!!!!  Actually, I'll read my other posts after posting this and remove the previous statement if I see that I've experienced worse.  If you're still reading this, though, consider yourself warned.  Just so y'all know, I read my one-star reviews of other restaurants.  This takes the cake.  WORST EVER."}
{"text":"I don't know why people hate it so much. From a Chinese perspective, I like it a lot. I'll be here every time I visit LV. Can't remember the service, but food is always counts first. It is absolutely as the same one as I had in China."}
{"text":"Was here for dim sum and lunch. Food was okay, not that great. Serving cup and ice glass were very dirty. Be Careful when they marked on your dim sum card.  The restaurant owner lady have gut to ask my brother in law for tip, but we already left tips on the table, even though they didn't deserve it. Will not come back ! Tip is only courtesy if they deserved it !!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning and the line was out the door. I looked over at Sam Woos, and the placed looked like it was closed even though the open sign was lit up. So I decided the food is probably going to be better over here judging by the crowd.   I went up the front, and waited about 5 minutes and never got acknowledged. I was just trying to get a number to get seated. A Chinese couple came up and spoke in cantonese and they were given seating numbers immediately. So I decided to interrupt and ask for a number as well. The asian lady gave me a dirty look, and the Chinese couple were nice enough to say that I was ahead of them and I deserve a number ahead of them. The asian lady refused and still gave me the later number. As I was walking away I heard .. \" he jus stan der like a wood, no say nuthin so no numba!\"     Hmm so I guess customer service is not exactly their forte here. Since its my last meal in Vegas, and I have been meaning to try some great off the strip Dim Sum, I just had to deal with it.   I was finally seated about 20 minutes later. The dim sum came at us hot and heavy. I was able to get all of my orange county favorites. The taste however was just as not as good as Seafood paradise in Little Saigon, but I would say its better then Cathays in Vegas.  The price of the food is definitely very reasonable. However the tip they earned was not so much. I expect at least to be acknowledged when I want to pay for service next time.   I have dined at Sam Woos and Shang Hais in the same shopping center, but as far as Chinese food goes, this is the most authentic out of them all. I would come here for the food, get abused a little bit then leave with a full stomach and a stink eye at everyone you see in this place."}
{"text":"I had no expectations coming in here as the reviews were pretty low. Harbor Palace is actually home to some pretty decent dim sum. But keep in mind this is coming from a Dallas born-and-raised gal where we do not have great dim sum. My group and I came here around 1pm on Sunday and there was no wait. There were a decent amount of carts rolling around with your typical dim sum dishes. The chili oil was oddly really good. We got the dim sum must-orders: har gow, shu mai, shrimp fun roll, and fried taro. All were delicious and flavorful. We ordered the two different types of tripe and were left pretty underwhelmed. The flavors were lacking and definitely needed the chili oil and soy sauce to amp things up. My group liked the chicken feet. I eat pretty weird things but chicken feet is something I never touch. The radish cake was also tasty. Overall, I liked and enjoyed the dim sum here. Unfortunately it took forever for us to get the check. The service is kinda spotty with but what Asian restaurant actually has good service?"}
{"text":"Craved for Chinese Food after a late night shift (10pm). This place is open until 5am! Score. Went here with a friend who actually recommended this place for being good & inexpensive.   Fish maw soup... Delicious! Sautéed greens... Amazing! Special fried rice... Scrumptious! And half duck... crispy goodness. To top it off the service was amazing! Very friendly & attentive :) Defiantly will be coming back... What more can you ask for? Friendly staff, good food & amazing prices"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had! Really bad service, the guy that works there is very rude and kept mean mugging us and the servers ignored us most of the time! It took them forever to give us a menu and even longer to take our order after that. They didn't give us water till after they gave us our food. And at the end after I paid for everything and was ready to walk out the guy goes \"what about tip?\" I wasn't planning on giving any with the way they treated us but he kept demanding it so I had no choice. Overall 1 star because the food was really good but will never go back to eat there!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and wanted to get some dim sum.  Reviews on Yelp were so-so but I decided to try it anyways. I am not a picky eater but I would have to say this was the worse dim sum I've ever had and I've been to a lot of dim sum restaurants.  I would not go here again nor would I recommend it to anyone.  Next time I'll try one of the other places in the strip mall."}
{"text":"We wanted to stop by Chinatown before leaving Las vegas. The place is pretty small with three or four carts. They serve typical items at any dim sum but they served pineapple buns with custard which are my favorite. Of course it's not as good as NY but it's decent. The prices were also much more expensive."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt to go to Pho Kim Long for dinner, my family and I decided to eat here.   Big mistake.  This is definitely the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.  My family and I didn't really have a problem with the servers, it was really the food that was quite lackluster.  We ordered dim sum (I want to give an extra star for the fact that they serve dim sum for dinner, but I just can't) off of an already used dim sum order form. We got the siu mai, har gau, shrimp balls and salt & pepper squid. The salt & pepper squid was basically fried squid flavored rings of batter. It was like eating hard squid chips. And that was so disappointing because my family loves well made salt and pepper squid. The siu mai had an odd aftertaste. The only dim sum I thought was okay was the har gau.   A lot of their condiments (soy sauce and chili oil) resided in dirty containers, so we were afraid to use them because they seemed old. The chili oil looked to be more oil or some other liquid than chili, which was kinda gross.   There's also no refills on drinks.  Safe to say that we're never eating here again."}
{"text":"Very, very , very poor service no coordination!!!!I If there 's negative stars , I will put negative 10 stars"}
{"text":"Awful! I have been coming here for 10 years! And the food has really suffered it is disgusting to say the least and their ingredients are definitely not fresh.  Even their hot sauce tastes like shit.  I would come here for the food because their service or lack of was not welcoming. unless you like not being acknowledged.  So if you are looking for terrible service where you are ignored and CACA food come here!"}
{"text":"1 star for customer service and another star for being open 24 hours and having a menu with various translations.   The food was not very good. It had no flavor whatsoever. The shumai and Chinese broccoli was the only thing that I liked. I ordered a bunch of other dim sum items, but they were very bland with no flavor. Stay away from the pork spareribs.... It tasted like cartilage.. That was overly boiled. I was really disappointed with the food, hence my 2am munchie mission with my gf = complete fail"}
{"text":"Limited dim sum selection. Slow and inattentive service. Skip it and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here as a last minute stop before we left Vegas. The food wasn't amazing nor horrible. The workers were nice and weren't annoying like the other asian cart ladies who try to bribe you to eat more. The lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel. Overall, Harbor Palace wasn't the best dim sum place that I've been to."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 10. From the outside restaurant looks nice but from the inside looks old and dingy. The first red flag was the table cloth on our table. It was filthy. Food stains all over it. The food too a really long time to come out. At least 30 min before we received any food. For a Chinese restaurant that's a long time. Last time we will ever be back."}
{"text":"it was nearly 6 oclock and the restaurant was empty.   they gave a lot of food for the food. couple of the dishes were salty and filled with MSG. although i must agree that there was a couple other dishes that were pretty decent.    quick review, i'll revisit when i have time"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Chinatown at the end of the plaza. We woke up pretty late that Saturday so dim sum was already over. We asked if they can still make it and they said they would. Great! Now we can enjoy Dim sum! After ordering, we realize that they kept bringing over the leftover dim sum for us. So we decided as hungry as we were we might as well get something. The dim sum was cold. We then decided to just wait for our hot dim sum to come out. Finally some hot dim sum!!! We were so hungry we order more than we can finish. Im so glad we were able to still order dim sum so late in the afternoon. I have to say the service is really slow. It took a while for them to come around."}
{"text":"If you are disappointed about CUSTOMER SERVICE out of an ASIAN restaurant you need to get out more.  The food is amazing, they hardly speak English, but you never leave hungry."}
{"text":"JULY 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu. The decor is ok. Overall this place is alright the food is not really that great. I would plan not to go to this restaraunt"}
{"text":"When I visit Las Vegas, I come to harbor palace for quick dim sum for breakfast rather than eating on the strip. They're located in the beginning part of Chinatown from strip so it's very convenient and parking is plentiful.   This dim sum restaurant is spacious inside. They can hold many people and it does get busy during holiday season.   The dim sum is affordable and descent for what you pay for. All the servers are pretty nice and same staff as I have visited every year. And this is probably the only dim sum place that opens at 8am during holiday season."}
{"text":"I love, LOVE dim sum and my family and I have been coming here for over 6 years for their dim sum. Honestly I haven't found a place that serves anything better than this place. I gave three stars because their service is mediocre. It's impossible to ever get any ones attention and good luck with sitting the corner of the restaurant-- you'll have to holler at the cart ladies to even come your way."}
{"text":"It's hit and miss -- some dishes are good, and some are just ok. The atmosphere, appearance and cleanliness, or lack thereof are questionable. Given where it is, it's doable -- especially when you're in dire need to fulfill cravings for dim sum."}
{"text":"Went Easter Sunday for dimsum with our Chinese doctor friend and his precious family.  Even with 6 of us, we couldn't begin to try all the things I spotted.  I disagree with Keith (which is unusual), in that I thought they had enormous variety.  You definitely need to go with a large group of hungry adventurous eaters.  We had everything from  taro cake to shark fin dumplings, chicken feet, seaweed salad, crispy tofu -- tofu so many ways I couldn't keep track, simple things like eggrolls, dynamite dumplings of all shapes, sizes and fillings...we had chinese greens and bao buns that were to die for.  Our host explained that we should also order something from the menu -- he picked his favorite soup -- fish maw...but wouldn't tell us what it was until we'd tried it.  I liked it -- until as he suspected -- once he told me what it was -- then somehow it didn't taste as good anymore -- and I'm pretty adventurous...  He also ordered walnut shrimp which were also great - but one bite put me over the edge -- and I couldn't eat another thing....  I saw lots of things going by that I'd have loved to try...but it will have to wait.    We met our host at 11:30 and it was packed with a wait.  They have a separate room for large tables -- 8 or more -- which seems to be the way to go, interestingly, to bypass the line.  The owner is a good friend of our host's and picked up the check -- so I have no idea what the bill was and never saw a menu....what I can tell you is that we were the only non-Asians that I saw in the place -- and that, to me, is always the best sign of where to find something truly delicious and authentic to eat.  My husband offered to work for free for the owner because he was amazed at some of the dishes served...  We'll definitely be back for more.  And I can't wait to see the menu...I've about decided I must have been Chinese in another life...  now  if only I can find my favorite Northern Chinese dish...mock peking duck..."}
{"text":"The food was marginal at best.  Pretty tasteless and poorly made in my opinion.  Half the things we ordered did not seem that presentable.  The carts were filthy (food spilled over the sides) and smelled of butane.  The food though was not the problem.  Service was terrible.  The carts rarely had fresh dim sum, and when we ordered items, it took forever.  Trying to get water was a monumental effort.  Trying to pay seriously took like 20 minutes.  Nobody wanted to get us the bill, when we finally got someone's attention we were told it wasn't her responsibility.  After walking up and trying to give someone our sheet to tally up, I was told to sit back down and wait, which I did for another 10 minutes.    The men's restroom was filthy... like worse than a public park filthy.  And the floor itself was sticky from what I presume was pee."}
{"text":"Ah, Chinatown in Vegas. There is no better place to eat then to visit a Chinatown and Vegas has its own. True to form, this Chinese restaurant was very good. Although not an impediment, language was a bit of a challenge. But we were able to communicate and be understood. We especially enjoyed the chicken potstickers. Wow they were very big. Much larger than the typical potstickers you find in restaurants that offer them. We also had fried rice with no soy sauce to reduce the sodium intake and it was very well-made. They tend to put a lot of eggs in their fried rice so if you're not friendly to eggs make sure you let them know."}
{"text":"The WORST dim sum I've ever tasted! I'm usually not a picky eater but the food was so bad, I left with an empty stomach since I couldn't bring myself to eat anymore crap."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly people. Great prices, will come back, with friends and family or birthday."}
{"text":"sorry to say, this was not good at all  i had dim sum Saturday afternoon. The food was delivered from carts table to table. the flavor was oka but was not the best from other dim sum places, also the texture of \"churng fun\" (noodles with either beef, bbq pork, or shrimp) was really grainy  eek  so we order pan fried yellow noodles which was better than the dim sum. but still kinda bland.   price range is kinda pricey from other places i've been to."}
{"text":"A friend had recommended us this place for Dim Sum. The restaurant has a nice decor with friendly staff. There is parking in the front as well.  They had your standard dim sum options of shu mai, pai gu-ot, and so on. The food was okay. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best (even though our friend who was a local said this is the place to go for dim sum). There wasn't too much taste I felt like with some of their dishes, but that's me comparing them to some dim sum places that I always go to in New York.  The staff was very friendly and attentive to my party of 6. There were probably two or three other tables filled while we were there so the restaurant wasn't that busy. I'd say if you're just looking to fill your stomach with some reasonably priced food then come here."}
{"text":"Was thinking to take a friend to try Chinese dim sum on this long weekend. It was such a disappointing place to go. The services were ridiculously bad. Four people served us and we waited for about 15 mins to get a confirmation on the availability of the dishes we ordered (two were not available). The third person came to us asking what we ordered. The fruit was free and served by the busboy in the middle of him collecting our dishes. Credit card is not accepted if the bill is less than $20. At the end, we had to run out to get cash. The changes were short. Guess the fourth person who served us decided on her own to keep the coins. Yeah, no return."}
{"text":"Bad service and the dim sum wasn't that great either!   As everyone knows, you don't go to a Chinese Restaurant for the service -- it's all about the food or in this case the Dum Sum.   We came here on our visit to Las Vegas and decided to take a gamble on this place. Unfortunately, the house won the bet and we lost.   Let's talk about service, or the lack of service. Every time we requested something from the waiter/waitress, we had to ask two or three times.   \"Miss, can we have some water?\"  \"Excuse me, can we have some water?\"  \"Hello? We asked for some water earlier -- can we have some water?\"   Maybe they didn't want us to get full from drinking, but I sounded like a broken record. When we finally got the water, the waitress didn't apologize or seem sorry that her service sucked!   On to the food --- this was some gross Dim Sum. The har-gow was blah - the chow fun was stick and nasty - the fried rice tasted like crap.   Nothing good here!"}
{"text":"For tourist being off the strip, we lucked out at this not fancy, but good seafood chinese restaurant.  Very inexpensive and a lot of food. . Pretty good actually Lots of locals."}
{"text":"The food was cold and they had to reheat our Dim Sum. The price is a bit pricey for cold food. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"One of mine and my husbands favorote Chinese food restaurants. Located in Chinatown. Prices are great. Food is fast and fresh. Dim sum is really good. Staff is friendly and alwats interact so nice with our daughter. Big restaurant, lots of tables, lots of options on menu. The house fried noodles (combination with seafood, pork and chicken) is soooo good! The Ginger chicken and the roast duck are our absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for the last 3 years for every visit we made to Vegas before moving here last year. We still continue to go to this location on occasion. Very good food here, I gave it 4 stars, mainly because of the customer service here. They are very slow and do not check on you as your there. You have to Hunt them down to get something, but the food is the best."}
{"text":"Tired of buffets during your annual trip to Vegas?  Check out Harbor Palace!!  Dropped by here last Sunday night with Mel and her family.  It was 100+ degrees outside....and 80-something inside.  Don't know if the A/C was on, but it was hot inside too!  The restaurant wasn't very well lit, and the place seemed like it would be dirty, but not dirty enough where you're grossed out by it.    Anyways, the wait staff was friendly (engaging in small talk with Melly Mel's mom) and offered suggestions while we were ordering.  Food came out super quick - not fast like a typical Chinese restaurant, but SUPER QUICK, like the dealers-taking-your-money-quick at the casinos down the street!   Things of note:   * Peking Spareribs were good, but a little sour due to them using a little more vinegar in their sauce than what I am used to. * Orange Chicken...yeah, just don't order it.  All white meat, but not good enough I'd order a 2nd time.  Would totally come back......but not for their Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"Bad service from the wait staff.  The host, was the ONLY one that should be working here.  He was very nice.  The ladies pushing the carts should be fired.  They stand around and talk to each other. They get mad if you wave them over for food.   Customer service is very foreign to them.  Food is cafeteria/food court quality.  You could buy the frozen dim sum at the store and it would taste the same."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I didn't even get my water until I asked for it. The sui Mai is terrible taste like shit. The vege is too bitter as it is too old. Where are the fresh food and vege? Everything took to the worse. The only thing that was still good was the chicken feet. Hopefully after this review they will improve over time."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat at while in Las Vegas. The appetizers in the cart, are AWESOME!!! Great service and and better food"}
{"text":"It has been four years since I been here and I couldn't remember why we didn't come back.  So with a $25 for $50 from restaurant.com we decided to try it again.  At first impression when walking into the restaurant the ambience felt unclean, but when checking SNHD websites they got an A grade. So we still decided to order.   Ordered tons of food, but the only thing that was memorable was the roast duck and the deep fried Chicken.  Everything else was either gross or off taste to what I am used to from a Cantonese flavor stand point.    What got me was they charge on the steam rice and extra bun for the duck.   At the end I realize there where no free bowl of soup, which was odd since we made a huge order and no oranges or desert at the end of the meal.    I guess I needed the reminder of why I didnt come back and now I can remind myself in the next four years when I read what I wrote.   I'm glad I gave them two chances before writing this so I know it wasn't just a one time decision and I will return to my regular place for dinner at KJ kitchen and ordchid garden for dim sum where majority of locals go and eat."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has lower ratings but we really enjoyed the food and service we received the 2 times we've dined here. The fried rice is full of flavor and they are very generous with ingredients. The egg rolls are not greasy and very tasty,  I don't eat seafood but my boyfriend ordered the dungeness crab in black bean sauce. I've never been here before and he has and was craving crab so he remembered going here before a few yrs ago. They also have dim sum. They have their normal dim sum from 930a-2pm and have a \"limited menu\" after 3pm until they close."}
{"text":"Good dim-sum ruined by extremely bad and rude service.  The dim sum is great, we always get the bbq pork buns, shumai, chicken feet, stir fried noodles, rice noodle with short ribs, etc.   Service on the other hand was pretty sad. We just ordered five waters and we were halfway full of food before it came out, and we had to ask about 3 different servers.  Not much else to say, this place has great potential, but let's face it. You are in Chinatown. You are in a traditionally ran Asian restaurant which means service is last on the priority list."}
{"text":"Went late night and was the only table in the place, good service the duck was very good tender with crispy skin and also pan friend noodles with beef were good too. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Expensive dim sum and not the most sanitary place. Two plates of rolled rice noodles w/BBQ pork cost about $10.. elsewhere it's $4-6 at most. Other dim sum dishes we ordered were mediocre at best, and cost about $3 per item for small portions.   We also ordered Beijing sweet & sour ribs, and a chicken with vegetables dish. These dishes came out quick and were pretty tasty. We had enough for leftovers for a family of 4. I'd recommend ordering any of the regular entrees vs. dim sum.  On the plus side, this place is pretty much open all the time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the bad reviews we had a great experience here for lunch.  We were seated right away and the dim sum carts arrived as soon as we sat down. The dim sum was excellent and the service was great. The waitress kept refilling our waters and checking on our hot tea. We had a great lunch off the strip !"}
{"text":"Terrible service they probably came once to ask if we we're okay with drinks. The dim sum that i asked for was cold and needed to be \"warmed\" up never going back"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. If you like instant gratification this place is for you. Despite the other reviews, I would say this place is as close to a \"Chinatown\" sense of vibe. Most places accommodate to an American comfortability, but this place is something new. They bring food to you. Just make sure you know what you want and it is completely okay to say no, and ask for a request. Also, a good place to practice your Chinese speaking and vocabulary skills"}
{"text":"This is the only place I go for dim sum in Vegas. I absolutely love it. This place hasn't changed much since my last visit 10 years ago. The food is always wonderful."}
{"text":"My friend lives in the area of this restaurant so I trusted him to make a good choice. I didn't check Yelp first and I regretted it later.  We arrived around 2pm so there weren't too many patrons but fortunately they were still serving dim sum. The food was ok but not great. I don't have anything interesting to say about this place. The service was fine.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Haha this place is a joke!  Poorly managed. Food is poor.   Server once replied \"Hey, the kitchen is backed up.. There's no use rushing me...!\"   Two servers delivered the wrong dishes TWICE to our table.   Stay away, don't waste your time. We'll never be back to this place on a Vegas trip for Chinese Cuisine."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for Dim Sum using a $15 Restaurant.com coupon.  They were located on W Spring Mountain Rd/Arville Rd in Las Vegas Chinatown.  As soon as we sat down, the metal carts surrounded us and kept on coming.  We started with:  Shark Fin Dumpling:  4 good sized thin skin dumplings filled with meat.  Pork Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce:  Average, a little fatty and not much black bean or jalapeno.  Custard Tart (Don Tot):  3 small bite-sized custard tarts.  I got these off the cart before they ran out.  Too many times I've gone to Dim Sum and the Don Tot are not ready or they are sold out.  This is one of my favorite childhood pastries.  Then we ordered:  Shu Mai: 4 shrimp and pork dumplings with a small shrimp on top.  More than bite-sized.  Har Gow: 4 dumplings filled with small whole shrimp.  Most places mince the shrimp.  Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (haam sui gau): 3 crisp dumplings filled with ground pork and dried shrimp.  The shrimp was a nice touch.  Green Bell Pepper with shrimp: 3 slices green bell bepper topped with a shrimp paste.  This was a dish that not all Dim Sum houses serve.  My friend will be back just for these.  Baked Coconut Custard Buns: 3 baked buns filled with coconut custard.  My friend said Oakland (California) Chinatown is better.  I thought they were decent.  The carts kept on coming around. They didn't have a large selection of Dim Sum, but we could have ordered some items off the menu.  I was looking forward to the Chinese tamales, Sticky fried rice, and BBQ pork pie, but did not see any.   It took a while to get the check and a To Go box. There are a lot of other Dim Sum houses in the Las Vegas area, but I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here I believe the night before Christmas. It was Super packed! Not only this restaurant but the whole plaza! No parking, plus all the crazy angry Asian drivers.  The sat us at a table by the entrance, so while we were eating people were standing by us waiting and just looking which is SUPER awkward. The tea cup and spoons were not washed thoroughly. They had some weird stuff on them. They were also hosting a party in one of their side rooms which is annoying because they reserved the room on a really busy night. Which meant that they got to enjoy themselves and not really have to wait when everyone else were crammed in the main room.  I would have given this place two stars, but I understand that it was super busy and that they were doing their best. I felt bad for one of the service people because she was kind of old and she was running back and forth trying to service everyone.  The food was ok for me but my parents love how the food taste, but they don't really know how to eat."}
{"text":"This place has the best seafood congee!!! It's not on the menu. Everything else sucks excepts this congee. Tastes perfect. Seafood comes with fresh fish (don't remember which fish), octopus, scallop, shrimp, ect.  Yummy!!!! Dont get anything else, u'll b disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever visited. The workers seemed out of it, customer service is non-existent and the food is just awful. The waiter spilled seater on my friend and he didn't even apologize. Everything we ordered was disgusting, the batter on the tempura vegetable was heavy and oily. Avoid this restaurant at all cost!"}
{"text":"Ever heard of the phrase \"Ho Hum, Dim Sum?\"  This place is the epitome of that phrase.  And just so you don't feel left out, you probably haven't heard of that phrase, cuz I just made it up...but this place was just that...Ho hum...  It wasn't that it was super bad, but it just wasn't very good.  I am not much of a dim sum snob, and as a matter of fact, I am probably the biggest suckered for dim sum in general...I LOVE IT...I just didn't love, or much like, this place.  In the end, two stars does it about justice...on a good day I might have given it 2.5 stars, but we can't give half stars anyway, so I won't lose sleep over it, and you shouldn't lose sleep over this place...  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring your side booches, out of the way so your significant other doesn't find out.  Cheap is great because you shouldn't be wasting  real money on second rate side booches to begin with."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I go here for Chinese food. They have good beef and chicken dishes. The Lobster and noodles was pretty good. The sizzling rice soup is not great. I have had much better. The rice is not crispy enough."}
{"text":"I just came here last weekend for some dim sum, and I know I have been here before very long ago but I don't remember the quality being this bad!  Came in around 1pm or so and all the plates I ordered were cold, not even warm!  They couldn't even cut the shrimp or crab balls or the rice rolled with shrimp with soy sauce over and they didn't even have sweet and sour sauce for the shrimp balls, instead they gave me a glob of mayo. Gross!  I would automatically assume they would cut the shrimp balls for you like any other dim sum places I've been.  And the pieces were all fairly small.  I don't think I enjoyed any of the plates, not even the ha cao and that's my favorite from every dim sum! Maybe the shiu mai a tad bit but that's about it.  Worst dim sum experience I've ever had despite the fact that it's in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Standard fare. We were craving dim sum on our Vegas trip and stumbled across this place. But this place seems to leave you super parched...I assume they use a lot of MSG in their food? The restaurant itself is clean enough but still seemed/felt dirty. Probably the old decor and old furniture didn't help. Service was all over the place. All the staff seems to be running around, you don't know who to ask for what."}
{"text":"Old fashion dim sum but quality of food can improve and service is so so because of how busy they are"}
{"text":"It was Sunday, Mother's Day and the Clippers had just eliminated the Memphis Grizzlies and we decided to go get some dim sum to celebrate.  One of my buddies had just got through saying he had never had bad dim sum and how bad could this place possibly (possiblai) be?  So we got a few items from the cart, typical dim sum stuff, and it wasn't a good sign when we all said, 'that's shumai???'  We ended up finishing what I think was 6 plates worth of stuff, got the bill and saw that it was pretty pricey for dim sum.  We were still hungry afterwards and ended up at Lee's Sandwiches at the next plaza over.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this place and not too sure there are many other dim sum options in Vegas."}
{"text":"i dont like leaving poor reviews but...  save your self! yucky, filthy place. and those poor fish in the tank! are they dead? alive? water looked more like a foggy gel.   if i was the owner i would not allow this food to be taken internally, horrid beef blaaahhh im sick thinking about it, ive got a strong gut but this stuff... i had to toss in the trash  come on man, you can do better than this! maybe its time to retire?"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is Okay.  Staff and service are good. Dim Sum prices are pretty good.  Average Chinese Dim Sum place, but don't know any place better that is close to the strip.  Overall three stars, just close your eyes if you need to go to the restroom."}
{"text":"I came here for DimSum because a friend recommended me to this place.  The dimsum is really good, but the service isn't quite as good. I would definitely come back here for a meal again!"}
{"text":"We were a little hesitate to have lunch here because there were only two parties in here. A single old lady and a couple who seemed to know the staff.   We first started w shrimp chow mein. It was a typical chow mein. Flavors were nice, portions were big but lacking the plentiful of bean sprouts I usually like in my noodles. The menu was pretty standard for an asian restaurant, beef, chicken, soups, shrimp etc...  Second we ordered squid w snow peas and I think a bean sauce, but that's not what came out. We tried it anyway but the squid was really bland and wasn't seasoned at all. I couldn't eat this.  Lastly we got as advertised, fresh live fish. It was sea bass today and to choose between steamed or fried, we got steamed. Being said it was live fresh fish I though i'd get a whole fish. I didn't. It was nice and moist, very good, but could have used some lemon, although I don't think that's traditional for this type of food.   Overally I give it a 2 out of 5."}
{"text":"We wanted to order food to-go for the trip back to LA. Dim sum sounded like the best option. Knew we should go to Chinatown since dim sum on the Strip is way overpriced. Yelped and found this place (despite all the other bad reviews). There happened to be a lot of street vendors in the plaza that day, so the parking situation was terrible.  Once inside, the waitress told us to sit at the table towards the back and to start ordering anything we like off the carts since they didn't have an itemized dim sum menu. We got the usual - har gow, shu mei, shrimp rice noodles, gluttonous rice, etc. The cart ladies were really nice even though I was speaking to them in broken Chinese. They kept checking on us and helped us box up the food as we ordered. Because we didn't know how many carts were going to come out, we sat there for a while and even started eating the porridge. Omg, this really hit the spot especially after a weekend of drinking and partying.   I think we ended up sitting there for a good 30 minutes before paying our check, which isn't really considered fast to-go food, so if you're in a hurry, you should have a better idea of what you want to get beforehand. Overall, the food is tasty and this will definitely be my go-to dim sum place in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service here is so bad that my family and I would not ever come back to again no matter how much we crave for dim sum.   The service ladies were not trained to be in this field at all. No smiles on their face, grumpy when handling our food and request. We asked for a high chair by the time they brought it out after many reminders, we were almost done.   On top of the horrible services, they gave themselves a tip added to the bill of 15%. We really don't  mind giving tips if their service was at least half decent. But for this place I would not give them a penny in tip for the way they treat their customers."}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco, I know my Chinese food. We ordered a few different plates and some just didn't taste right. We ordered some egg rolls that came hard like a rock, most likely from being refried.  We ordered some Mao Pao tofu and it wasn't even a little bit spicy.   We were entertained by a bunch of street racers that use the parking lot as a meeting grounds. Bunch of kids driving Hondas and a couple Miata."}
{"text":"Dimsum is so awful! Expensive and with the taste, it really is not worth it. One plate is like $4-6. I can go to another dimsum place for cheaper and better food. Really regret coming here. Rude waiter/ess doesnt even want to serve us. My advice is :  the best thing they have is water or else JUST DONT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family last night. Service was mediocre. We asked for some pepper and the girl looked so confused.   We ordered five dishes and they all were either too salty or had no taste.   The only dish done well was the the garlic veggie dish which is a standard at any Chinese restaurant. All around disapponting."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star. The food is alright but the service is very awful.   If I were you and looking for a place to dine and relax, this is definitely not the place for you. If they are consistent on one thing, it's how horrible their service is. Give yourself a break and don't try this place.  Don't go here especially at night time; the server which is the only lady they got at night is discourteous and very rude. She was very impatient and impolite, maybe it's the language barrier but there was no need for her to give us some tone, attitude and dirty looks (She kept rolling her eyes, pouting her lips and giving deep frustrated breaths that  to my astonishment she was not ashamed to show us .) as we were ordering our food. We have to ask for water three times before someone actually gave us our drinks. The meal gets bad to worse experience when they forgot to cook one of my friend's orders, who end up not eating. (The first time we went there they also forgot to cook my order I thought it was just an honest mistake, now I know they just don't care. This was our second time to visit and definitely the last).   Everyone in our party of seven people was upset when we left the place."}
{"text":"Holy grossness...I guess I shouldn't be so harsh about this place but the Vegas Strip is the land of food and I really think the competition is tight. If I had to wear high heels and fake eyelashes. I think this place can step up its game too! This place just doesn't do it for me.   Pros: Banh Cuon with Suong Service  Cons: Price Location Food"}
{"text":"Food was nothing great, tasted bland and very pricey! Dimsum wasn't great and ambiance is sloppy. The worst part is the VERY RUDE servers. We checked in on YELP and saw that there are free Egg Rolls when you check in. Two of us checked in and we showed the server our phones so we could get our free egg roll. We got a rude reply of \"ONLY ONE PER TABLE!!!\" Sheesh lady, you could tell us in a better way rather than raising your voice at us. Never going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is good when it is fresh however, to me it seems like they lack variety. And as another person mentioned unless you can read chinese you won't be able to tell what you are being charged for or the name of the dishes. So if you want to order them in the future I guess you are just going to have to wait until you see it in one of the carts. I like their shrimp ball, and crab ball the most but when they do have a lot of variety it is really good. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Today I realized I haven't written in sooo long. It's funny reading these reviews due to the extremes of \"Yea it sucks\" - \" Eh middle\" - \"WTF THIS IS FANTASTIC\" . So I'm not sure if I'm being retarded...but I always get great service there. Maybe it's my wit, and charming personality....good looking, dashing, debonair, fun, smart,......yea...But this isn't a review about me.  One thing I like - LATE NIGHT! I LOVE LATE NIGHT AFFORDABLE DINING. ESPECIALLY CHINESE! Because you get that craving on Mmmm I'm hungry. But the cool thing about chinese is you can eat a lot - 20 min later you're hungry again! I'm not sure if it's MSG...or it's the little parasites living in everyone's body from swimming in infested rivers.  To be honest. I like the food here. It's definitely chinese. But at the same time they do serve to curve the All American Apple Pie Appetite with things like orange chicken, lemon chicken, broccoli beef....zzzzzz Oh I'm sorry if you order these things...STICK TO PANDA! It helps if you've been to a chinese restaurant with a chinaman. Because they can order! They order fast and in small syllables. Next thing you know you have a feast to feed a small village.  I do like dim sum here....mmmm dumplings, shrimp or pok. Mmmm and the sesame ball. Ok so good. Good for vegetarian too. I find myself typing but in my head I'm speaking in a chinese accent....Weird. I think they've been friendly to me because I'm filipino. Oh yea that's it. Because the menu is catered to filipinos. Sure I can read most of the Tagalog on the menu. But where's the filipino food?? Oh...Rice...."}
{"text":"The dimsum is good and the price was good as well. I don't know what the other yelpers are talking about, I've gone here 4-5 times (almost every time I go to Vegas) and it's always packed and the food is authentic. The price also isn't as steep as Chang's across the street, and I recommend this place if you're looking for dimsum near the strip."}
{"text":"Harbor Palace get hammered here on Yelp...mostly because I think there is nothing special about this place. It is a utilitarian dim sum place that is located in close proximity to the strip and lacks immediate competition. We had brunch here on a Sunday and the food was actually okay. Although I thought the dumplings could have been much better and the shaomai was just okay, I enjoyed the Chinese broccoli, char siu baau, and shrimp har gao.   Our servers were very friendly and the place was totally packed (with Chinese people) when we were there. My only complaint was that the servers with carts were really trying to push as many dishes on us as possible.   I would definitely go back, and I'm still trying to figure out where all the 1-star reviews are coming from....the food was okay-to-good and the price was very cheap. Near the strip, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with some friends. Located in china town, you would expect some very authentic dish. Overall, the dim sum was a average. We had the Chinese broccoli which was like any other place. The chicken feet was a little bit in the bland side. We got some stir fried noodle which tasted like the noodles you would find at a buffet. I'm not going to go into the other dishes I got since there's not too much to really say about those... They were pretty much average."}
{"text":"Wow such bad reviews? Not the best Dim Sum I've had but definitely not bad! At first you think Dim Sum in the dessert? but honestly there are more than enough Asians in Vegas to warrant a great Dim Sum place! Service was average as well. not great but not bad. The only dish I had a complaint about was the Chow Mein. How do you screw that up? I mean Chinese invent it so long ago and just about everyone in the civilized world has tried it. Well unfortunately the noodles were way under-cooked. like eating a package of uncooked top ramen, and yes I know there are people that like to eat it that way. So if you're one of those people I have a great recommendation for you."}
{"text":"I had an overall terrible experience at Harbor Palace.  The service was terrible, the food came out slow, and when it did, the food was very mediocre, at best.  I brought two of my friends here because they wanted some good Dim Sum, and ended up wishing I went to practically any of the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.    We ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Green Beans with Minced Pork, Hong Kong Style Crispy Noodles, and Fried Fish.  The only thing that was even remotely flavorful was the green beans, and everything else was bland, cold, and under-salted.  The noodles were soaking in a bland gravy that tasted like they thickened water and put it on top of the noodles.  The fried fish wasn't crispy and was bland, as well.  The soup came out last, and very cold.  I couldn't believe they actually served this to us.  We tried to complain but no one understood what we were saying, and we didn't see the waiter after we ordered until we got our check.    Overall a terrible meal, and I definitely will not be coming back considering that HK Star and Joyful House are right down the street."}
{"text":"The best Dim Sum I have found in Vegas. The food comes out nice and hot and usually they check to make sure you have gotten what you would like when they notice you are slowing down on picking off the carts.  The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"it is inside chinatown mall in las vegas, has dim sum and regular menu, mainly for the tourist coming from LA area by the tour bus, place is spacious and clean, food is ok."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nothing to shout about, nor was the decor nor the service. In fact, the service was pretty god damn awful to say the least. But then again, this is a Chinese restaurant and everyone knows service is going to be bad. If it were good, I'd be shocked.  So after several attempts at trying to find good dim sum, we ventured to this place after I saw it advertised on the Chinese channel while watching TV in the hotel. Believe it or not the hotel had Chinese satellite TV feeding from Hong Kong. I was up late watching old Cantonese soap operas -- but I digress.  So anyway, one of the places advertised was this one. Hubby thought for sure the food was going to be good seeing it obviously catered to a Chinese clientele. Well he was right. The dim sum, although not artistically created into teeny weenie morsels, were done well. Not only that but everything tasted good. The tripe was steamed with ginger and scallions -- lots of flavor, not like the one at Chang's. In fact, the har gow was also very very good (unlike that of Chang's). Cha siu bao was above average (and I don't even like cha siu bao) and so was the stuffed bean curd sheets.  I was a bit annoyed at the fact that when I asked for iced water, they kept passing the buck to someone else. Finally I just yelled out at a dim sum lady who then yelled out to 'amigo' in the back who rushed out towards me. Before he could even walk 5 steps I yelled out \"DOS AGUAS\" and he immediately turned around and got us 2 iced waters pronto.  4 stars for decent dim sum.  1 star for service."}
{"text":"Worst dim sum service ever. Do not sit in the back room. They forget about you. Usually we always over order but no one came to us. At that point we didn't want to eat anymore. My friend asked for more napkins and she said later and never came back with it. We ordered snow pea sprouts and it never came out. No one came to check on usour anytHing. There were seven of us and they brought us four waters. Honestly I've had better dim sum with more variety too. It only seemed like they had the same three carts rotating. We really didn't want top leave a tip whatsoever but the bus boy was the only one that came to us."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is decent.  I've had better in many other places, but I don't know of too many in Vegas.  They have the dim sum in the push carts.  We had a quick lunch at Harbor Palace and it consisted of:  - steamed pork buns - shrimp dumplings  - rice wrapped in lotus leaf  - sesame balls with red bean paste - long rice noodles with bbq pork  It's tiered pricing and about the same as in most places in the San Gabriel Valley (Southern California).  Overall, I would go back if I wanted dim sum in Vegas!  Xie Xie!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place in search of a chinese restaurant, just so we don't get sick of eating buffets all weekend. Not only is this the worst chinese restaurant I've been to, this is the worst restaurant period. We went here for dinner and the service was TERRIBLE. Food took forever to come out and the complimentary tea was warm. I've had a lot of chinese food and they have by far the most bland tasting food ever. They use ginger in every dish so it all tastes the same. I had to dip everything in soysauce (which I had to walk up and get myself) just to have some flavor.  Their servers look like they hate their job, and the decor looks like a bunch of elementary school kids' artwork. I will never step foot in this restaurant ever, and I hardly say that about any place."}
{"text":"the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. i ordered a lot of different foods and it was all disgusting."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Harbor Palace ranks on the bottom of my list of dim sum places in Vegas.  It was my second visit ever and it just reconfirmed my experience from the first time I went.  Saturday brunch - 11:30 am arrival.  Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)  We have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.  We had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, \"You want dim sum!?\"  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)  But in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)    We got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.  Rice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.    I asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!  Deep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.  Other dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.  The Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)  Overall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.  They do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.  And please stop asking for Sriracha sauce, you know who you are!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting food I have ever had in my life.  I ordered pan fried vegetables and in the picture it had carrots, corn, asparagus,  peas, etc.  When my food came I got some weird spongy fungus that looked like tripe.  None of the vegetables in the picture.  The smell was horrible and the taste was so bad, almost sour.  My husband ordered pepper steak and it had no flavor.  I couldn't eat my food it was so bad.  I obviously will never return."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for the past 10 years but this time I am very disappointed with the service. I do understand at times if they are very busy but It was a time when the place was not full and the order came in 40 mins after placing our order. I kept silent and swallowed the poor timeliness of the food serving but when I asked for my check, the server ignored me twice and I had to go to the cashier to pay. I am not going back to this restaurant ever again and time for me to go look for another Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place didn't have better reviews. I debated between a 3 and 4 star.  Either way I would def go back because the dim sum was amazing.  We went on a Saturday where we are used to only getting Dim Sum on Sundays where we live so that was awesome. The staff was super nice.  Lots of selection, the calamari was good, the Taro was very very good! It had the usual dim sum items like chicken feet but had not as common ones like the whole baby fish and bitter melon."}
{"text":"Dim-sum for brunch. Harbor Palace in China-town LV. This is part of the \" get off the strip\" adventure.  Thought is was good. Dim-sum was \" par for the course \"  kinda like  \"ho hum dim sum\"  Don't know why many dim-sum joints paint their walls a putrid green  and, and true to form this place has flat screen monitors with a loop of advertisements.  This is a Chinese sea food restaurant that serves dim-sum. Sited in a \"Strip mall\" with Chinese/asian motif.   Food: good / basic  Service: hey it is dim-sum, women wondering around with carts Value: thought it was ok"}
{"text":"The dim sum food is okay, but the prices are kind of extreme. I ordered the shrimp balls over the crab. It was $7 for 2 balls! We didn't know until the bill came, so I wished they had a way of marking the prices of their dim sum plates on the carts. Another shrimp plate I ordered on the dim sum cart was $7 too, so that was a bummer.   We got the spareribs and eggplant hot pot. It came with very little rice for the two of us to share. How do you eat hot pot with so little rice? Most other restaurants will give a large pot of rice to your table if you order a dinner size entree.   In looking at the other reviews, I see most people say the food is good, but the service is bad. My experience was the opposite. The service was fine and I had no problem getting food in a fast and friendly manner, but to me, the food is only mediocre."}
{"text":"I guess Dim Sum is only certain time of the day , I was disappointed  but I was very hungry so I came here . No Peking duck as well . It also very bright inside lol but I was hungry so I stayed and eat . I will have extra for to go since I ordered 2 order. Even with a simple dish of mixed veggie and house fried rice is very boring in looks and taste. Needles to say I am not impressed."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us beyond expectations. During the time we went they had BOGO lobsters and it was sautéed perfectly. Loved the calamari. I think it was $270 totaled, tips included. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place almost three weeks ago.. Very good selection of food and the Chicken Lo Mein was so good... A good friend of mine took me and I would love to go again. Excellent service"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food here in Vegas for me. The dim sum carts are just endless. I'm not a big fan of Chinese cuisine but this place is an exception. Love the fact that they're open till 5 am."}
{"text":"if you want to eat at a filthy dirty, gross dim sum restaurant, then come here.  this was my first time eating at this restaurant, and will certainly be my last!!  because ichiza was closed for lunch, therefore we ended up coming here for dim sum, and what a mistake it was, i was so embarrassed to have brought my family here.  the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, and they stuck us in a table close to the kitchen, where we can see all the dirty dishes and disgusting left overs, right then, i've pretty much lost my appetite.  the dim sum selections were very limited, and didn't taste fresh at all. most of the items were cold and stale, and the worst steamed dumplings(chiao long bao) i've ever tasted. the skin was very thick and hard, and not even sure what the stuffing was, definitely tasted like left overs from days ago....yack!!  the worst part was the sanitation of this restaurant, the carpet/flooring was filthy, and while we were eating, some waitress started to clean and spray cleaning solutions right next to our table, and some of it even got into our foods...i really wonder how this place got away from the health inspection dept.!"}
{"text":"I usually yelp places to eat and wish I yelped this place before coming in. We decided to eat here as there was a sign rated as #1 chinese restaurant. Would never go here again. Bad service, dirty, and below average food. The peking duck was the worst I've had. Drenched in oil and skin not crispy."}
{"text":"The outside of this place looks nice, and that's a big plus when you're looking for somewhere to eat because it stands out. The inside however, doesn't. I wasn't pleased with the atmosphere inside, it reminded me of a Asian supermarket. Everything was kinda old looking, and it just didn't set the right mood for me to eat.  The food was mediocre. I've definitely had A LOT better. I know my dim sum and when it's not the way I expect it to be, I'm in a bad mood. The people there seem to hate their jobs and service wasn't all that great. I didn't eat a lot, and didn't bother taking anything to go. If you don't believe me, go check it out.  Not a place to go if you're looking for good dim sum in Vegas."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is quite famous online, and there are lots of positive comments online. Last night we tried to have dinner here, but was blown away for the long queue here, so we decided to have another trial here for its dim sum. I am not a Cantonese, and I believe that the dim sumshouldbe ok, and might not accomplish a five-star. Its choice is not so plentiful, however the price is quite smiling, so I will give it a four star to encourage."}
{"text":"Very bad,  waitress!  Bad service, long wait time.  Crazy prizes. Specials not on holidays or weekend is what she told us, But it was a Wednesday (no holiday)...."}
{"text":"we came for dimsum, and it was super slow. and when we walked in, all the carts came all at once, and was too pushy. like I don't want anything from your cart, and I told you that once; but you're still at my table. servers/cart pushers were really rude too. needs to give us space when we eat. then when we got done, we waited 10 mins to get our check/bill, and when we went to the front, the lady up front was a huge meanie, she had the biggest attitude ever. byeeeee, but your guys' food is still yummy."}
{"text":"I came to this place a couple years back. Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant was a pretty good place to eat. I enjoyed the food that had here."}
{"text":"No good...I went for take out and noone speaks English very well? In Vegas with so many tourists?? I'm a local, and the only thing that was good are their spring rolls but not too consistant..their dim sum, and they have alot of them..are bland!!! Staff is not very friendly to say the least!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Their sio mai is huge they're not those little baby ones. The waiters and waitress get you your stuff quickly and they're friendly. If they run out of what're you're looking for in their dim sum they'll give you the fresh one as soon it comes out. Overall the dim sum is fire, highly recommended. The mango pudding is crazy good definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I recently wen to Vegas with my mother and since we have been there so many times, we wanted to get  night out of the STRIP restaurants. we went over to Chinatown and thought, what the heck, lets try this place. Inside was pretty boring, setup seemed more like your average cheap place. The waiter did not speak good english at all.....service seemed OK at best. My mom ordered Mongolian beef, her fav. which she found to be good and a very large portion. I had gotten the Jellyfish and Fish Maw and Crab Soup.....also VERY large portions. IT WAS AMAZING. I live in Alaska and have been searching form Fish maw and jellyfish since I have gotten back...only found one of them...I would definitely check out this place if you are into hole in the wall authentic places where you can try new bizarre foods....."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some an order of vegetarian friend rise (just eggs and veggies) and a minced meat rice plate for the drive home back to the bay.  The fried rice was ok but the minced meat place was not minced meat.  They just cut up slices of beef, put some gravy on it and used bok choy instead of peas.   Pretty disappointed with it."}
{"text":"I've been craving for Dim Sum for the longest time, and my prayers were answered. We had the shrimp pork shomei, steamed bbq pork bun, potstickers, the main stuff, and let me tell you... 4/5 for the food, everything was fresh and yummy.  3/5 for the service however...the workers were rather old and they seemed inpatient and careless. The manager constantly checked up on us which is the good side, but the food took too long to come.  Overall, it was satisfying and the price for two wasn't too bad.."}
{"text":"Best place for Roasted Duck! It was so juicy and the seasoning was excellent. I didn't care much for the other dishes that we ordered, especially the Orange Chicken which was very dry. Service wasn't great but we got our food fairly quickly. Overall, I'd really only come here for the duck but I'd be willing to try other items on the menu and hopefully I can find something I like."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant by accident (my mom wanted Chinese food). First impression was that it was a bit of a shabby atmosphere. The cup had a bit of veggie or something stuck to it so first impressions were not great. The food we ordered was mediocre. The salty meat was a bit strange. I tried it a bit but didn't want to continue eating it.   This place is not my first choice of place to choose. I guess if you have a large family or group, it's doable."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is very roomy; can definitely host many people per table. However, at 4-5pm, it's not really an ideal place for Dim Sum. I supposed the saying, \"Dim Sum you win, Dim Sum you lose\" is really applicable here. The food came out mildly hot and by the time you get to it again it's already cold. Granted today was windy outside, but that should not face affected the temp of the food.   I've had better Dim Sum Days. I'll have to think twice about coming here again."}
{"text":"You know what the best thing about Harbor Palace is?  It's next to a Mr. Sandwich baguette shop. After being completely revolted by this place, We ended up hungry and went over for some delicious roasted pork sandwiches.   (yeah, this place sucked that bad. Greasy dim sum, surly dim sum ladies.  The steamed beef roll wrapped in bean curd was disturbingly sour. We stopped ordering after only five items, but the damage was done - a $31 tab to leave the premises. But I guess it's the only game in town, so that's why it's still in business.)"}
{"text":"I had a late night special meal - sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, complimentary hot tea, soup and oranges for dessert for ~10.   - tea was smooth, soothing. - waiters are hasty. fast service.  - unclean yet not filthy restaurant. - Not a deal. Small portion. - disappointing taste. tasted like sweet and sour chicken at costco.    -____-  I came back here for their lunch special on Monday and I ordered  3.95 level c Dim Sum 6.50 lunch lemon chicken for $14  - The lunch special came with egg drop soup which was pretty good - I enjoyed the lemon chicken.  - It also came with an egg roll  - Average Lunch special taste  - Free hot tea! Bonus!  - Dim sum that I got was pretty good.  - I'll come back for lunch"}
{"text":"Good for a dim sum fix, and a cure for a hangover.  They've got all the usuals, normal price for dim sum, and attack you once you sit down."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I've had a ton of extraordinary dim sum and wasn't holding any standards while eating out in Las Vegas. However, this place was pretty good! I didn't eat anything other than dim sum so I can't vouch for their other entrees, but after a long night heading here for brunch satisfied me for sure!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum? In Vegas?  We were all hungry and (well, mostly us midwest girls) were craving dim sum on a Saturday, so off we went out of the strip to go get dim sum.  We reached the little Chinatown plaza outside the strip, went to Harbor Palace and sat down right away. In came the carts- ordered my normals- chong fun, ha gao, shiu mai, etcera, along with my chicken feet.  The quality was okay. I made it fulfilled my craving? Wasn't exactly the best dim sum ever...but we were hungry and it sure beat Cleveland's dim sum, that's for sure.  Maybe this place would be better for dinner?"}
{"text":"Un-be-lievable!  We should have stuck to our gut instincts and said \"no\" to trying out another dim sum place, other than our usual, Orchids Garden.  We should have also read all of the Yelp reviews on this place before entering their restaurant.  What a mistake we made!  Never before have I asked my family to ditch a restaurant the moment we got seated...until this day!  Walking in, my family didn't get greeted by the host upfront with his head buried in a newspaper.  No.  Instead, it felt as though we had disturbed him.  It took him a while to muster up a \"how many?\" before he removed himself from his seat to sit us at a table.  STRIKE ONE.  Next, we asked our server if they had dim sum.  To which she rudely replied, \"Dim sum, no order!\" seeing we had their menu before us.  Okayyyy.  Understandably, we weren't going to order dim sum from their menu, as we are accustomed to ordering from CARTS!  She walked away and returned with a paper menu of dim sum items and a pencil and dropped them at our table; no explanation.  Weird, so I assume, we DO have to ORDER, as we see no cart in sight anyway.  STRIKE TWO!  We finally get to writing down our list of dim sum items we would like.  We then proceed to asking her for two more settings for our table of four (we were seated on a table set for two).  Without a word, she turned around and grabbed two settings from an open table.  As she began to \"place\" them on our table, she pushed past my two young children reaching over them, resulting in her \"thrusting\" the fork and knife toward my husband as he was writing.  Really, woman?  She basically poked his hand with a fork tine, never excused herself for it, and simply walked away.  RUDE!  STRIKE THREE!!!  At that point, I asked my husband if we could leave.  So upsetting!  As I walked past the server, who then realized we were walking out, I pointed at her and scolded her with a \"YOU NEED TO BE NICER!\"  Then we left.  Now, I apologize in advance if I offend, I have no intention of it.  But, seriously?  At some Chinese restaurants, you are commonly accustomed to experience a kind of abrupt, hurried kind of service that is typical of their customary practice.  I should know.  I'm Chinese myself.  So, I'm not being overly sensitive of the situation at Harbor Palace that night.  I know what to typically expect, or not expect.  But, this???  The customer service at Harbor Palace should not be experienced by any paying patron, no matter what!  (I should say, the lack of customer service).  They have no common sense of decency when it comes to working with people.  In fact, I believe that because they are \"fed\" their business via tour buses (don't ask me how or why it is that way), they feel the need to not offer good, if any, customer service.  We are NEVER returning to this place again.  They are disgusting."}
{"text":"This place did not impress me or make me want to come back for dim sum.  The photos look better than the taste, not yummy at all."}
{"text":"Place is alright. Dim sum selection is good amount, taste is ehh. Staff was ehhh. not surre who our server was, but there was one guy who tended to us the most. At the end, we gave the guy a $5 tip, but then thiss other lady was asking us too leave tip like 5 times. We told her we gave tip already, but when she saw that it wasnt on the table, she asked again, so we left a $3 tip extra. So basically, you HAVE too leave tip or else they will pester you aboutt it. I hatee that, because the service wasnt even the greatest. Overall, ok, but wont come back."}
{"text":"Ah I'm sorry but I have to give this place low marks. The food is, by far, the worst dim sum place I've ever had.   I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur of dim sum by any means, but I've had my fair share of good and bad places. Although we came during peak hours (they had a decent amount of customers), the food tasted stale and hard. Many of the items we ordered seemed like they were sitting out for a while. So, perhaps they'd consider not making so much food until there's actually demand for it.  I'm not one to typically mind a dingy and dirty place (see my other reviews). But food quality should make up for that. In this case, it didn't. One look inside one of their dim sum carts and it'd be enough to make you stop what you're eating switch to tea."}
{"text":"So good. Best meal I had while in Vegas. Don't bother ordering off the menu because they come around with lots of delicious dishes on carts. Each dish ranges from $2-$4 depending on which cart you take from. It was very confusing at first but once we figured out the pricing & cart system we enjoyed it. Want something different & authentic? Come here."}
{"text":"if you i can give this negative rating, i will. bad customer service. dirty food. don't come here."}
{"text":"I've had dim sum here a few times, but after the last time I was here, I'm over it. They have your usual dim sum selection- shu mai, potstickers, dumplings, sesame balls, etc. It has always tasted like your typical dim sum, which is what brought me back. Besides, it's close to where we usually stay and it was convenient for lunch before leaving Vegas.  So why am I over it? The server got upset because our tip was inadequate. Honestly, what server provides you with horrible service and then brings your tip back to you and says, \"What is this? This is not enough!\"? Oh, it gets better. She proceeded to calculate the \"correct\" tip amount for us and said that was how much more we owed her.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I used to go to Harbor Palace for many many years. It seems like the last couple times I went there the food & service are getting worse and worse. Sometime the waitress didn't even bother to check on us until we asked for our check. Dim Sum tasted horrible also. They were dry and seem like been sitting out for hours. Me and my wife probably wont go back there again."}
{"text":"The worst I have ever had. The food was priced ok, mostly delivered cold and greasy. I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good dim sum for not being in SF or NYC. Prices a little high for what you get but not bad."}
{"text":"Omg worst customer service  ever...... went to eat there and have to ask for water 4 or 5x. I got mad and didn't tips them and they even have the gut to come tell us to tips them. Some crazy Chinese people."}
{"text":"The quality has really changed. This used to be my favorite place for fried rice so I didn't mind the further ride, but now I will just find a place closer in the Southwest."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese fare with some unusual additions. Excellent attentive service. Reasonable prices. Neat and clean environment. For example, the hot oil and sauce consumers are Crystal clean, not sticky.   Pleasant extras include wet towellettes after appetizer spare ribs (I'd rate them a solid 4 out ,of 5) complimentary rice was served without having to ask and fresh oranges arrived with the check after the meal.   Hot and Sour soup ranks 4.5 stars. Same for the Mongolian Beef. All the dishes were served piping hot. The sizzling beef platter ordered by the table next to us smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"I never taste so bad Cantonese dim sum until went to the Harbor Palace. I ordered the steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll. I always go to the Rowland Height where has to much Chinese restaurant to enjoy their dim sum. So, I know what is good or bad. I tasted a little bit steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll, I fell it is sourer and so bad. (Those two staff don't taste sourer in normally.) I told the manager something wrong with steamed chicken feet black bean sauce and steamed beef in rice noodle roll. She was so rude to say, she not grantee steamed chicken feet black bean sauce is fresh today, but she grantee steamed beef in rice noodle roll is made today. She just cancel the chicken feet for me, and didn't allow me return the rice roll also. She look like so much unhappy, and the waiter and waitress have bad servers, too. And the price for staff are little bit expanse. I never go to here any more."}
{"text":"The selection of dim sum is good by comparison to other Chinese restaurants in San Francisco,   Millbrae, Milpitas or San Jose California.  The service was fine and selections were good. I'd return again."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I ordered the fish filet with black bean sauce and its great.  They also have dimsum"}
{"text":"Our first time we were here, we were satisfied.  This is our second visit and it sucked big duck beaks!  Horrible service, no dim sum carts coming around, horrible service!  NEVER again!"}
{"text":"I only came here once and it was after a looong evening of drinking and gambling.  The food was fine for what it was...nothing to write home about but I had never been so dehydrated in my life the next morning!  Ofcourse more restaurants serve food high in sodium but I had never felt this bad before.  So what's the point of all this?  I guess I am saying there are a lot of better/healthier choices for drunken food.  Fatburger would be a good example."}
{"text":"The dim sum was decent but the selection was small. Price was good but all dim sum places should have good prices!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food so don't come here if you are looking for Panda Express... I've been coming here since 2002 and though the quality has faltered through the years it's still pretty good.  I haven't tried most the items because I'm Americanized but the fried rice is light and good, the dry Chow Fun is our favorite it has a smokey flavor to it and they used to hand make the the filling in the potstickers ( now it tastes premade) it's still better than average.  It's worth a try..."}
{"text":"It's Las Vegas, can't expect too much.  They have your most typical dim sum.  Sweet tofu was the best."}
{"text":"Ordered crab rangoons and crab fried rice from here awhile back and had the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced. The insides of the crab rangoons were yellowish? And tasted old. I ordered off of uber eats or I would've brought them back. My boyfriend and I were both hospitalized due to it and when I complained no one ever got back to me about it. It was such a bad sickness I'm nauseous writing it."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and it's GOOD! When I try new restaurants, I always order my favorite dry fried string beans. This restaurant is among the best I've had.  Although the decor is tired and dated with poor 'cloud' paint job on the ceiling, the main dining room is airy with tall vaulted ceilings."}
{"text":"We often go here for Dim Sum at lunch.  Great selection of well prepared dishes.  Dinner has some standard Chinese dishes but also has some very authentic ones.  This restaurant smells like and tastes like a real Hong Kong restaurant in Las Vegas.  We also see buses of Chinese tourists coming here to eat.  There are large rooms to accommodate them.  Good servie."}
{"text":"The mister had never been to the Chinatown area of Vegas, so we decided to have Chinese food for brunch.  Although I had a few spots in the area bookmarked that had higher ratings, we settled on Harbor Palace because we were starving and didn't want to go hunting for the other places.    The place is a typical, no fuss Chinese restaurant.  Nothing fancy, but not too grungy.  They were still serving dim sum, but since it was already 2P, they had run out of most of our usuals.  We were able to get the pork baos, siumai, and shrimp dumplings.  The dim sum was good, but it is much back back in Cali. We ordered some congee, but it was nasty, it was runny and had no flavor.  The highlight of the experience was the service.  We had a nice server who kept checking on us and always had a smile.  In a Chinese restaurant that can be hard to come by.   The food was not bad, but like the 2-star rating states: Meh, I've had better."}
{"text":"2 stars for many reasons. Never mind about the mediocre food, don't know which is worse, the service or cleanliness of this place.   Open late and fair prices, will do after a long club night..."}
{"text":"Food was okay, the issue lies in the fact that they did not give us an itemized receipt. I ate with 3 other people, and ordered 8 different courses (we were very hungry). I felt we had been overcharged and asked for an itemized receipt to show us our orders and their costs. They did not oblige. Be weary of this place if you plan to eat a lot."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  If I didn't have a $25 off a $50 bill coupon I would have been upset. There was nothing horrible about the food but nothing spectacular either.  I would have expected the anchor of the largest mall in China Town to be amazing.     The place always has busloads of people arriving (I mean real busloads of tourists) and they mob the place.  There are much better meals available in China Town."}
{"text":"I have never been to this restaurant in person. This review is based on my delivery experience.  Take-out or delivery \"Chinese\" food is ubiquitous in any American city with a population of over 100k. And most major American cities have a neighborhood designated as \"China Town.\" In spite of that, there are few Chinese restaurants here in Vegas that serve food that people in China eat, as opposed to Chinese food.  This restaurant serves what Chinese people call \"food.\" And I call it \"delicious.\" And except for their specialties, very affordable (they have abalone braised in oyster sauce. $80, but who's counting. Maybe I'll get a GoFundMe account, 'cause I REALLY wanna try that! I imagine that's not precisely what GoFundMe is for, though.)  The chicken with ginger and scallions is sublime. The \"mustard greens with top soup\" is a bit hard to understand; they pack the greens and soup separately. It is delicious, too. And fried rice is fried rice, but they raise the bar a bit.  I understand they do dim sum. I can hardly wait to visit them and have some authentic dim sum, which I hear they do very well.  I subtracted one star because they serve shark fin soup. But I won't pontificate here, it's not appropriate. Suffice to say, if you're tempted, and have never tried it, it's not worth the money (shark fin soup in general). I had it once, in Hong Kong, and it was so \"meh.\" Okay, I guess I pontificated a little. So sorry!  Please do try this establishment out. If you prefer American style Chinese food, they can accommodate your tastes, and if you want try something different and closer to what they eat in China, they have plenty of options. And if you've got enough moolah for the abalone or lobster, send me a note and tell me how it was!"}
{"text":"Ehhh, probably didn't help that I had dim sum a week later in SF but I think my whole group agreed that this place was mediocre.   Service was slow and the ladies weren't the friendliest people. Definitely do not come without someone that can communicate to them.  Food was alright, but it didn't taste very fresh even though we came shortly after they opened on a Sunday morning. It wasn't very busy and there weren't many carts to choose from but I might be spoiled with dim sum joints in CA.   Overall, food didn't taste fresh nor very good and the lack of service made it a lackluster experience. It was cheap, only ~$10 each with 7 people! But I probably won't be back.   Tip: They only split card 4 ways so bring cash!"}
{"text":"We should have read the review first, turned most are true. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The service is the worst I've experienced. The Dim Sum person kept pushing to buy more...we kept saying no...no...no more but they kept insisting to buy more. The service and place is terrible. They said they have it but when we ordered it they say not available. We ended up not odering anything and just paid for the Dim Sum we ordered and left. If you plan to eat Chinese food/Dim Sum, do not go to this place."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the place is dirty looking.  Probably not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Would give this place zero star if possible.. WORST DIM SUM EVER!!! Do not waste your time here, the food was disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is not clean at all, don't be fooled by the exterior. It looks nice from the outside with glass doors and stuff but when you walk in the rugs are DIRTY, the tables are STICKY and you would think a resturant like this would be running with some nice A/C... NOPE! We ate our food in a hot and disgusting place and did not enjoy it. A fly kept on hovering over our food. Service was horrible and the dim sum are not freshly made, they rolled the cart to our table and after we chose our dishes they said they would heat it up for us really quick. Do yourself a favor and do not eat here"}
{"text":"Weve been here several times times the gentleman that i believe runs this place is amazing we love their food their always nice and friendly well always come back. Love this place !!"}
{"text":"I love the food here that is why i come back. But most of the time, the guy in the front, maybe the manager, i really don't know who he is, IS SO EFFIN' RUDE!!! He's usually there late in the afternoon to late night. He showed me where my table is without giving the menu. I waited for it and nothing. I stood up and walked back in front and asked for it politely, he was writing something and did not even say anything or looked at me, when i was asking him the menu. I walked away thinking that maybe he was just really busy, then when i was already seated, he said Hey! Here's the menu, without moving his feet and trying to say, come here and get it! So stupid! Then i actually realized that he really did ignored me face to face when i approached him about the menu in the first place. And because of that, I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN! RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS! CUSTOMERS EXPECT SERVICE! GOOD SERVICE!!! THAT IS WHERE YOUR TIPS COME FROM!!! WE PAY FOR IT!!! I STILL PAID FOR IT!!!  I will not hesitate anymore to drive to the next block to go to ORCHIDS! Tourist come here because this is the one in the main Chinatown block and because they didn't know about the other ones around. Maybe now i know why there's more customers at Orchids. I am not connected with Orchids, i just had the oppurtunity to compare the two big ones. and i am just a of dimsums. So customer, do your research first. You can always feel full after you eat, but don't you think it's much better when you feel full and feel good after you eat?!!!"}
{"text":"Located at the end of Chinatown Plaza. Average ambiance and interesting layout to fit the dim sum for a quick fix. Nothing novel. Tired gals trudge their carts in circles if you can yield their attention. Bussers clear dishes regularly. Typically loud if groups of Chinese are bussed in."}
{"text":"I like the variety of Chinese food here.  Service is fast and good.  Gr8 sauces and seafood choices.  I had the beef chow fun in black bean sauce which was delicious.  Can change ingredients in dishes to suit your taste.  Loved the Korean pickled veggies given b4 the meal. Nice hot pots and sizzling plates.  China town location w/lots of parking/seating."}
{"text":"went to Harbor Palace for dim sum,most was cold and the same carts came around 4 or 5 times with the same cold dishes on carts.Used to be a lot better but seems like things have changed for the worse.will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 4 times before and liked it OK. I find it funny that the menu is in Chinese of course, but also has subtitles in Tagalog.  I like it when ethnic restaurants are full of diners of that ethnicity; They're keeping it real.  Today I was craving the Walnut Shrimp.  I pull into the parking lot and there's a crowd of people waiting to go in. What !?!? That's never happened before. I guess this is a popular place on Sunday morn compared to the weekday afternoons that I have been here before. I get inside and am seated quickly. And there are ladies with dim sum carts. I have not had that since I left LA years ago. The Walnut Shrimp can wait for another day.  Hot green tea was brought to my table quickly.  I got my food from the first carts to come my way: calamari, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp in a thin dough and 2 dessert type buns: pineapple and coconut. I liked it all. The hot food was hot; the fried food was crisp; the dessert buns were soft. It all tasted fresh.  Took most of it home since I was alone and could not possibly eat it all in one sitting.  I think the servers did a good job. They got people in and out quickly. There is a language barrier but to me that just adds to the experience.  p.s. After reading Yelp reviews, I guess it's a good thing that I have never seen the lady's bathroom LOL."}
{"text":"The only reason why we went here was because after a 4hour road trip from CA we wanted some dim sum to start our weekend off and since the Harbor Palace was listed off offering it on the Malls board we walked over and decided to give it a try.  There wasn't much variety after looking at 4-5 different carts that's all they had to offer. The siu mei and the chicken feet were the highlights everything else was bland and not exactly worth the meal . Go save your stomache for one of the places to eat at in the malls or try out ping pang pong down the road for better dim sum.  Though for some reason the place was filling up pretty quick i'm assuming is because of that sign thats posted listing off all of the restuarants and what they have to serve. I guess its a plus that they serve until 5am on weekends."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a good experience except a man was screaming at a customer over the phone. Hot and sour soup was extremely sour. Server offered to change the soup for me, but I didn't eat it again. So, I wasn't sure how it was afterwards. Recommended if you are a dimsum fan."}
{"text":"You definitely don't come here for the service. Probably shouldn't come for the food either. It's sub optimal. Why does my gfs family like to come here"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas I was eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet on Tuesday night with my family..........a few hours later (into the evening), one of my family members experienced projectile vomiting, & ungodly nonstop diarrhea from eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet!   The next day when it was time to eat again, there was no way that we were gonna do any buffet!  Had to look for something to take out, and something light for my loved one, so off I went to the little Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Road.........I found this rather large Chinese restaurant called - Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant.  In I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?  Lucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!  This place offered seven types of juk -  1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large 2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large 3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large 4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large 5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large 6. Chicken Porridge - $12.00 for Large 7. Beef Porridge - $12.00 for Large  I ended up ordering the Fish Porridge...........it was the perfect thing to have, when you have a loved one ailing from a queezy stomach."}
{"text":"MAN! this place has suuuuuuuuuuuccchhhh a good location, good name and all. but the food is notttttttttttttttt that good!   i know this place gets alot of business b/c of the location, but please people... venture out and read yelp!!!!!! cathay house is much much much much better than this place. its just a little bit down the street on the right hand side and about the same price.  I will only come here if i am meeting friends here and suggesting another place is out of the question.  havnt had dim sum here, but my close friend didnt like this place very much either.  I had dinner here... the food was ok, but i've had better."}
{"text":"Our group wanted to get out of the strip to get some good food so we stopped here to get dim sum. The dim sum was really good. Everything was made to order and came out hot. Price range wasn't too bad and the service was good as well. This place needs some renovating as the decor is outdated and the bathrooms are dirty."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness.  My parents and I had longer-than-usual stay in Las Vegas and were tired of food and buffets on The Strip, so we decided to venture into LV's \"Chinatown\" and see what we could scrounge up to eat.  We saw lines in a few places, but we decided to settle for dim sum.  It seemed to be really popular because the restaurant lobby was vomiting out people.  I mean, really, spewing people out everywhere, loitering and waiting about.  My parents, being the stubborn people that they are, decided to take a number and wait.  With a small party of 3, the wait shouldn't be that long.    Well, it was.  By the time I got in, I was starving.  We waited for almost an hour.  By that sheer fact, I thought the food would be wonderful.  I mean, why else would people be waiting that long to eat?  Let down again.  I mean, it was relatively good considering I've been living in NH where their dimsum selection is a little... well, non-existent.  And it's the first bite of dimsum I've had in months and months.  So, it wasn't bad.  But I am still well-aware that there is plenty of good dimsum back in SF.  I mean, much better.  They were sooo busy, that no one paid attention to us when we wanted to pay our bill.  And the place smelled funny.  And it was SO crowded.  I was such between my dad's elbows and someone else's baby carriage.  With a baby in it!  Watching me eat!  Good Lord.  Next time, I'm sure we'll try somewhere else if we wanted dimsum in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great dimsum, very friendly service. We went there 3 time for lunch and dinners. The owner is very sweet and nice. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We just had uber eats deliver the \"steamed chicken\" expecting we would get yummy chicken cuts with vegetables LOL the entire box was literally cut up chicken bones and skin. There was MAYBE a couple edible peices IF THAT in the box. My boyfriend and i ended up eating mostly rice since they packed us left over butchered pieces, literally. They gave us ribs with no meat, legs with no drum meat on them, and chopped up skin!!! Thats exactly what i paid $11 for. I could have bought myself an entire rotisserie chicken for $8. I never write horrible reviews, but really? Bones and skin???"}
{"text":"Good food. fast service. Cheap. + they give you discount $5 off for a $25+ bill and $10 off for a $50 bill.! cant beat that"}
{"text":"I would give four stars for the food, but the service was pretty horrible.  Staff was sloppy, brusque, and not very pleasant.   Dim sum was good and the price was really reasonable.  A good choice for families and large groups if you don't mind the lack in service."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times as I was starving and really would really not go back if I could help it just because their decor is unpleasant and they were out of egg tarts by 12:30 and did not have any beef balls! Both times the same cart lady completely avoided me altogether! I even called her and another cart lady had to tell her to come over; twice in two separate visits after going round and round seemed like too much of a coincidence. The place is poorly lit, not ideal for cart traffic and just grungy in general. I only like their beef roll, leaf wrapped rice and their baked custard buns which are my favorite nice and hot. Their steamed BBQ buns are not very good but their Har Gow was huge and decent."}
{"text":"Fantastic-scrumptious-yummy-and all of the the great superlatives describing a great meal! A must go to when in Las Vegas. We are there every time we are here for trade show. Great food-great service-great fun. Irwin Z"}
{"text":"The worst place I've been too!! Food is not in good quality and cost $6 for one dish dim sum!!! And server was not efficient and seems lazy!!! If you ever want to try dim sum!!! Do not go there!!!!"}
{"text":"We came on here on a monday for lunch and I swear there were more employees than there were customers! With that said, the dim sum ladies still took forever to make it to our table! The chop sticks came with leftover food on it and the dim sum portions were just hillarious! The dad and I were looking on the steam cart and the woman said we have shu mai in both a large and smaller size portion............????? Really?! Never heard of that before.   I'd probably say if you're on spring mountain you're better off going somewhere else because this place is a joke and a poor excuse for a Chinese dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"I give it a 5 star review because everything I tried here was delicious. I got sautéed scallops with vegetables, and it was perfect. Their egg rolls are the best in town. And the prices are fair, it looks like everything is half price after 10 pm. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the ladies restroom wasn't clean at all and the staff doesn't speak a good English. It was hard to understand."}
{"text":"This place has the best dimsum I have ever had. We come her each time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The dim sum here was pretty good,  and the service was relatively friendly.  The location is right in the center of Chinatown."}
