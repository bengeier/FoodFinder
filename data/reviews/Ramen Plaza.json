{"text":"Bien que son affichage soit plutôt timide sur la rue St-Hubert, une fois à l'intérieur son décor vous charmera et vous vous sentirez très vite confortable. J'ai commandé la soupe repas Ramen Miso Épicé qui est composé de maïs, champignons, oignons vert, feuille de nori, uf, porc haché et nouille ramen. Le riche bouillon était parfaitement épicé. Les grains de maïs sucré coupaient le gras du bouillon, ce qui offrait une belle balance de saveurs. La teneur en sel était très plaisante aussi (je n'était pas assoiffée en sortant du restaurant comme ça m'es déjà arrivé avec d'autre soupe repas). L'uf était parfaitement cuit dure avec son jaune encore mollet. Mon seul commentaire négatif serait le ratio de porc haché versus les nouilles ramen. Il y avait beaucoup trop de porc. J'ai eu seulement 3-4 bouchés de nouille tandis que le porc haché semblait être infinie dans mon bol. J'aurais voulu plus de nouille ramen. Aussi, je n'ai pas trop aimé la feuille de nori mais il s'agit ici de mes goûts personnels. Après ce bol, je n'avais plus faim et donc pour 14,00$ je trouve cela très raisonnable vu la qualité du plat présenté. Pour finir, le service était courtois et attentionné. Mon avis final: si vous prévoyez visiter la Plaza St-Hubert, allez vous réchauffez avec une bonne soupe ramen! Ca vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. The staff is inviting, the layout is very nice and the food is brilliant. Arguably the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"Je suis du genre à laisser la chance au coureur, un nouveau restaurant ne peut pas être parfait, n'est-ce pas ?   Nous nous sommes installés à l'intérieur et avons regardé le menu qui comportait peu d'options, donc quelques unes qui n'étaient pas disponibles. Nous avons donc opté pour 2 bières en bouteille et 2 soupes au porc. Le bouillon était bon, mais peu '' onctueux '' comme on peut retrouver ailleurs. En général, j'aime la différence, mais malheureusement, le goût était plutôt absent. Les nouilles étaient comme je l'aime, c'est-à-dire pas trop molles. Le porc était bien cuit et pas trop gras.  Le prix était.. correct pour un ramen, soit une quinzaine de dollars."}
{"text":"Lots of bad reviews about this place and I don't know why. I'll admit I ate here for free and that I don't often eat \"real\" ramen, but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed everything we ate here a few weeks back.   We had two ramen soups (the ramen plaza which is like a tonkotsu and the spicy miso ramen) which were both very good: the broth was super flavourful, the noodles were perfectly cooked and the pulled pork (in the ramen plaza) was just wow, amazingly delicious and tasteful. The karaage chicken was also super yummy; moist, tender, juicy and flavourful. And I absolutely looooved the smoked meat dumplings, they are probably one of the best I've ever had (and I've eaten a lot). The combination of flavours was super unique and just delicious. We also tried the vegetarian dumplings with tofu, which were also very good. We also liked the drinks we ordered; I had the Ajamé cocktail, which is basically a mojito with some passion fruit juice - very unique and refreshing.   I guess some people don't like Ramen Plaza because it isn't \"traditional\" enough? Or not like other ramen places? But that's because RP doesn't strive to be the bestest and greatest and most wonderfullest ramen resto in Montreal; their goal is to be a \"restaurant de quartier\" for people who live nearby and are craving a decent bowl of ramen. So perhaps, y'all should take that into consideration before bashing up a local business.

{"text":"The place has very nice decor. The staff is very welcoming. The ramen also comes with free roasted tea. The tea taste good. However, the ramen doesn't taste that good. We ordered the tonkatsu ramen and spicy miso ramen. The tonkatsu ramen was quite tasteless and the spicy miso ramen was very salty. I was pretty disappointed because the ramens look so delicious but the taste wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately no matter how cute the decor is, how friendly the staff are or what a perfect location it is... I will never return to a restaurant if the food wasn't good.   Ramen was extremely oily and had too much going on. Pulled pork, braised pork, corn, mushrooms, soft boiled egg, nori paper all sound delicious but when you put it together it just doesn't work. The broth was lacking that aroma I love inhaling. The noodles absorbed the broth too quickly and overall the ramen was not my cup of tea.   Overall the restaurant has great ambiance and the staff are tending to your every need. In the end, the main reason why people come back is for the food and that's not the reason why I would ever go back to ramen plaza"}
{"text":"Yeah! Ramen on St-Hubert! The timing could not be more perfect! What could be better than a steamy hot bowl of delicious ramen on a cold winter's day!? My husband and I came here with our kids a week ago and we were pleasantly surprised! The menu is very small, but each item is wonderfully delicious; we should know, we ordered almost everything on the menu. My daughter really liked the Montreal gyoza (very unique) but no one is our group was as thrilled with the veggie gyoza. Try their fried chicken... I think it was even better than any of the ramens we had! Very reasonably priced... we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this week. Had the edamame and Plaza Ramen. The restaurant itself is well decorated and cute. However, I waited over 30 mins for my ramen to arrive. Server said they \"lost\" my order. A little disappointing considering it was not busy at all. The ramen was fine. Tasty, slightly salty (the way I like it) and the pork was nice and tender. Egg was perfectly cooked. It's definitely not my favorite ramen place but it still hit the spot. If you're in the area, I would say it's one of the better places to eat at but I would not make the detour to return here."}
{"text":"Cute spot on the Plaza, unfortunately, the food is disappointing. The broth wasn't really tasty and was really greasy. I stopped eating after a few bites. I'll not go back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, while the idea of a hip ramen place along the somewhat rundown upper stretch of the Plaza St Hubert is great, I can't recommend this one.   Most of the other reviews are spot on. This is clueless ramen. When the soup arrives it appears more like a thick stew rather than-- well-- ramen, and after about 5 minutes congeals into a kind of slop. It is heavy, greasy, and full of awkwardly discordant flavors.   The smoked meat dumplings are also clever, but the execution is subpar; they're somewhat insipid.   After eating here, I developed a stomach ache. My friend didn't-- but, being displeased by how hers had turned into a mush, had only eaten a third, so who knows if she would have.   Doesn't seem as if the managers / chefs have been reading any of these reviews, or they are simply ignoring them.   In the volatile quick turnaround Mtl restaurant scene, not to adapt and improve isn't a smart move.   The service was fine-- hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"A.M.A.Z.I.N.G, the decor is amazing and if you add the delicious the noodles in it. Subarashii but I do have to admit that broth was a little bit on the thicker side but still very delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is a disappointment for me. The ramen looks great but taste bad. The broth is way too thick with a weird taste. Not very authentic!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive prices for their cheap food. Their soup broth tastes exactly like the soy bean paste I buy from my local korean grocery store, and water. I make better ramen at home...  Lovely presentation though, and I like their cute spoons. Their ambiance inside is nice, but I wouldn't want to sit on backless stool chairs for an hour. We sat at a big table since we were allowed to choose anywhere, but the kind waitress did not take away the extra cups and utensils after we sat, so I hope they don't keep them there for the next customers... incase we touched any without her knowing. (we didn't lol but the opportunity was there, and that troubles me).  Stay away from their steamed \"dumplings\". Both dipping sauces were bland and very watered down, nothing held onto the dumplings because it was really too watery. Crispy sheet ontop of dumplings was interesting and very nice.  Vegetarian dumplings had a very odd soft cheese texture inside that did not go well with the soft dumpling texture outside.  Smoked Meat dumplings tasted just like hamburger meat, and the waitress explained that they were brought in, and were official \"Montreal Smoked Meat\"... I think what they did is bring in pre-made smoked meat, rolled dumpling dough around it, then steamed them, which double cooks the meat inside, turning it into hamburger meat, loosing all of it's smoked meat quality... They have no place in this style of food.  Their menu is incredibly small (all their soup selections were very similar to eachother), which can be a good thing and help them specialize and make what they have really good, but they don't actually make anything themselves... it's all brought in and they just put it together, which is really sad. I understand why the place was so empty.  Their extra \"Spicy Miso\" Paste was not very spicy at all. Very diluted. Their extra \"Spicy Oil\" was also not very spicy, only barely, and I tested it by itself and realized that it was just mostly canola oil plus an awkward after taste... I couldn't use it... wasn't even spicy and I tasted it pure... it should have burnt my tongue at least a little, but nothing, so I avoided it.  Their boiled egg looked a little scary. The colors were so weird, like synthetic, espeacially the yolk. I think these were brought in as well, because they didn't look \"fresh\", which is strange because it's just a boiled egg.  Tofu, mushrooms, green onion, carrots... were normal. Ramen noodles were normal, but over cooked.  Their \"Matcha Cheese Cake\" sounded good on their menu, but after trying all their obviously store bought stuff... I decided not to risk wasting 6$ on a slice of cake that was probably on the same quality level as everything else.  None of the chefs cooking in the back open kitchen were asian. They looked like young white hipsters. I've tasted amazing asian food from non asian chefs many times before, but these people don't belong here. They're just opening packages and reheating them, which makes them no longer an actual restaurant. Waste of my time and money. They clearly have the equipment to cook real food, but it looks like they're into shortcuts, at MY expense no doubt, so I will not return.  This type of ramen and food is for people who are easily offended by actual flavors, like old people, and like something bland like cafeteria food. Reading how salty the broth was from the other reviews here, I'm betting that it was because the cooks put too much bean paste, which is salty itself. Clearly they don't put much else in their broth. Get out of here already lol This place is a joke. Run.  I understand that they are not trying to cook authentic asian dishes, which is obvious by their attempt to make montreal smoked meat dumplings. Their ideas are fine, as their written menu looked good. But they just don't   know how to carry out anything. Very low standards that can only be acceptable by people with low standards or are too drunk to care. Overcharging, and are really taking advantage of people. They think we're all dumb... and you know what? They're probably right lol.  Fkn hipsters ruin everything... what a waste of 40$ !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the signature \"Ramen Plaza\" ramen here for lunch recently. Although there were only three customers, the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive. I am not Japanese or a great fan of Japanese food, but I have eaten much ramen in Japan and elsewhere and generally I like it. This dish was new to me as it was white and creamy, and I am not sure of whether there was milk in it. The essence of good ramen is said to be the broth, which struck me here as gross and almost inedible because of its fat and salt content. The noodles, another essential component, were hardly distinguishable from what comes in the instant Cup o' Noodles. The meat was probably cha siu but again very fat. Only the shredded mushrooms reminded me of the delicacy of Japanese cuisine elsewhere, and there was half a duck egg. After leaving the restaurant, I felt immediately nauseated and I had to battle nausea for two and a half hours. Including tax but not tip, this signature dish cost Canadian $16.10. The service was friendly but most of the seating available was on high, uncomfortable stools, and the atmosphere was not remotely Japanese."}
{"text":"On cherchait une nouvelle place pour manger une bonne soupe ramen. On a opté pour cette place ouvert récemment. On a pris chacun une soupe ramen tonkotsu (14$) + en entrée des gyoza (8$). C'était bon, mais je ne peux pas dire que c'était la meilleure que j'ai mangé à Montréal, ma copine aussi. Décoration assez sombre / noir et minimaliste. La serveuse était un peu occupée/débordée avec les commandes. On y a été un samedi soir, il y avait quelques gens au début et ça c'est rempli au final assez vite avant qu'on part. Bon prix, 2 soupes ramen + entrée + 1 bière incluant service/pourboire/taxes = 55,44$. Si vous êtes sur la Plaza Saint-Hubert et que vous voulez une souper ramen, vous avez trouvé.  4/5 visité en décembre 2016"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good tea, friendly staff and sub par ramen. Big fat bummer. The pork broth tasted like an onion soup packet mixed with a little pork broth. The noodles were broken. The bork belly seemed to be caramelized. Like a maple bacon. The soft boiled egg was just a soft boiled egg, not marinated at all. So, big fat bummer. My search for authentic ramen in Montreal continues."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice and the service was really good.  Now, the food itself was a big let down. My boyfriend and I ordered the smoke meat gyoza, a spicy miso ramen and a tonkotsu ramen. The gyoza: I thought it was an original idea and I was mostly curious as to what it would taste like. Unfortunately, I don't think it was a good idea.  The ramens: Too oily and it is either tasteless or the flavour wasn't there. For the tonkotsu ramen, the pulled pork is too salty, the texture of the braised pork was quite well done but it seems like it wasn't simmered enough for the flavour to go through it. For the spicy miso ramen, you don't even taste the sweetness of the corns for some reasons and too much shredded pepper. The enoki mushroom was either lightly steamed or not at all.   They should really change up the recipes or else, I don't think this place is going to survive especially in the plaza."}
