{"text":"After a long wait, I finally got an invite and it was certainly worth the wait. Everything was fabulous and the best steak and shrimp you'll have for life."}
{"text":"Amazing cuisine, fish flown in from all over the world for sushi, good company to share an intimate lovely dinner. Invite only."}
{"text":"Since this not open to the public, it should be removed from yelp. So confusing and waste people's time"}
{"text":"I you're lucky enough to get an invite...you're in for a REAL treat.  Best sushi available in the burgh."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and was looking forward to checking this place out after reading the reviews, but I walked to the location and it said \"TMD Holdings LLC\" on the door and something about a tailoring service. This is a corporate kitchen, accessible by invitation only. Google them - they have a website that says they're a manufacturing company and pictures on Google shows an office building. Google maps street view is even better."}
{"text":"Got invited and Chef Stevie and Blair did NOT disappoint.  TMD has some if the best sushi and I went home still thinking *nomnomnom*. Nothing less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's No.1 Sushi place...... The open-plan kitchen brings you both gustatory and visual pleasure."}
