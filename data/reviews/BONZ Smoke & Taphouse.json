{"text":"Walked in, ordered food and a drink and not 30 seconds later a bar fight started (at 8 pm on a Saturday!) And the at fault party was not the evicted party. Left immediately. We came here a fair amount as Icehouse and liked it just fine, I'm not on board with coming back at this point. Disappointing. Looked nice inside though!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was a horrid experience. The food could have saved us but service was incredibly non-existent. This was not due to the waiter - she tried hard, but she was serving a restaurant with 40+ people, by herself.  Went in on Nov 25 at around 1pm for lunch.  We sat promptly, not greeted by a grumpy employee who we later found out was at the very end of her shift and couldn't wait to get us out of her face. We know this cause as soon as we sat, we saw her run for her things and bolt out the door.  Fine, hopefully our waitress will be better.  She was friendly but that was the end of it.  For some reason, the allowed folks to sit anywhere on the restaurant, all spread out, with only ONE server on the floor.  Inexplicably, there was a lady who I guess was the 'manager' essentially hiding by the bard doing nothing. It was really bizarre - she was just looking around and sort of moving around but not really helping the poor water who was clearly overwhelmed with trying to keep with the patrons.  The manager eventually got around and moved a plate here and there, but really did essentially nothing for the one and a half hours we were there.  When restaurants get rebranded it is for a reason - here it was because they were loosing clientele to the barrage of breweries and other restaurants opening around the South End area. We went there when it was the IceHouse and service was not terrible but we really did not go back because the service was just mediocre and the place clearly catered to beer drinking, apartment dwellers from nearby.  The food was ok, just your regular bar food but will say the BBQ was ok testing.  Unfortunately the kitchen messed up too. It was not until we had to get up from the table (remember the disappearing waiter) and almost yank our server from the hair to get her attention that were able to tell her our daughter's pizza did not make it to the table. Eventually it came out but at that time, the rest of the table was essentially done with the food. There is a reason this place is tracking to a mere 3 stars in Yelp. Save yourself some painful experience and enjoy one of the other 3 dozen restaurants in the Dilworth area."}
{"text":"Smoked meats were not as tender as expected and lacked flavor.  And I had high hopes for this place since it was called Bonez. Sides were good thought."}
{"text":"First time back since it was Icehouse and very impressed! The salad was very fresh and I loved the local Mecktoberfest beer. We had the margarita pizza and half roasted chicken which were terrific! Great atmosphere too. On the cons side the football game volume was turned way too high to where I could barely communicate with the waitress and our food came out warm, not hot. Great otherwise"}
{"text":"I really like the new menu and format and it's a great spot to sit outside to watch any sporting event given the upgrades they made to the awning and covers for colder nights. Cara is one of the best bartenders in Clt and she has the regulars to back that up. My suggestion would be to sit outside at the bar or a table with Cara and have some pork nachos.  They are both wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and there was a great atmosphere. Fun place to checkout in the area. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We walked out after a rude food delivery to our table.  The Waitress from Pittsburgh was nice.  The food delivery person killed the deal with bad attitude."}
{"text":"Second time we order via foodie call (decided to give them a second chance after the first disappointment). I have to say the second time was actually worse! Ordered their Texas two-step with ribs and pulled pork and hubby had their fried chicken. Everything was INCREDIBLY DRY! Considering that it was NOT CHEAP for the quality, I have to say I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"So we just came here on a whim.  We actually visited the fabulous spice shop next door.  Appearance is like any other bar restaurant. We sat at the bar and were disappointed  (actually irritated) that they did not list ABVs on the menu. I'm sorry, but we are in Charlotte, one of the brewery capitals. Throw me a bone here,  let me know.  I do not think they change it out that much.  Seriously,  make beeradvocate.com a favorite on your browser.  So we spent a few to find a beer suitable for our taste and decided on the Noda hop drop, 7.2.... which is not bad considering I'm a more of a 9.0 and above lady.    Bathrooms decent and so is the service.  Although we had a beer here, nothing calls me back.  And the beers are over priced. But hey if you want sports, sub par and over priced beers, then this is the placed to be."}
{"text":"This place just opened I guess, I recently moved here from Massachusetts so I wanted some good southern BBQ food. The restaurant is nice and clean, lots of tvs and seems like it would be a great place to have a few beers since they have a ton of beer on tap, but my food was awful. I ordered pulled pork with macaroni and cheese, French fries and a sweet tea. The pulled pork was cold and seemed like it was probably sitting on the counter for three hours before I ate it, it came out extremely quick which was great but I don't like cold food I'd rather wait and have it be warm and fresh. The macaroni and cheese was awful, cold and didn't taste good at all. The French fries were mediocre. My server was very friendly which was the only upside of this experience. I'd like to give it another try since it's right near my house, hopefully next time it will be better. If not I certainly won't return."}
{"text":"Sat at bar, Ton's of tv's! They have Guinness on tap!! Place was kinda busy for Friday afternoon 2ish. Salmon BLT was good, not dry, good flavor. Barely ate the tots as sandwich was good size. Burger ordered medium rare. as bartender said not much seasoning/flavor but was juicy. Onion rings good...too wide and seemed not cooked long enough.  Bartender was awesome. poor thing the liquor shelves were put too high up the wall behind the beer taps. Got footstool?! Will visit again"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the game with my girlfriend. Super friendly staff and fun atmosphere with a great beer selection. Food was on point, strongly recommend the wings and bacon cheese fries. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon and gave them a whirl.  While the location is killer, and our service was fine, I don't think they understand just how smokin' the BBQ biz is in CLT.  Everything was OK, but nothing near OMG.  With Mac's just down the road, and McCoy's another click further, they gotta really put some wood on the fire if they want to take a slice outta this hunk of meat (slathered in sauce and fallin' off da bone).  Bonz, you got your work cut out for you."}
{"text":"Incompetent server.  Can't answer a question on a special on the board.  Brings a beer that was never ordered.  Bacon, mushroom, Swiss burger has no mushrooms on it.  Side is cold.  HORRIBLE experience.  Is there a way to take stars away?????"}
{"text":"Don't get the jambalaya unless you like instant rice and a tiny little piece of sausage and no flavor.  Was very disappointed that my husband and 3 kids spent $80+ without alcohol just to get less than mediocre food.  The fried pickles were great and the kids didn't complain about their burgers but the restaurant gave jambalaya a bad name.  We even asked before committing to ordering it if it was good and the waitress said it was very good.  Apparently, she's only eaten it out of a box or frozen food isle if she thought that was good.  Come on guys, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to create a better dish than that."}
{"text":"Tried some of the new menu items, have to say I was impressed. The food was good and they really give you more than enough portions.   The changes to the old icehouse are nice as well. I just really wish they would ditch the seat yourself concept. We waited for almost 10 mins to get Someone to come over, they had maybe 10 customers, so not busy at all. I think this would be fixed with a perm hostess.   Once we did get waited on our server made up for the delay, by being very attentive and friendly. Will def go back again. I think they still have some work to do, and feel like they can't tell exactly which way they want to go based on the menu, but give them a try."}
{"text":"Had diner last night and had the two step  ribs and brisket. The ribs were great! Meat fell off bone tender and flavorful. However it was another story about the brisket.... It was  dry close to jerky with little taste. Friends had the pulled pork and said it was fantastic. Service provided by Sabrina outstanding"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try since I live next door and love how ample the lay out is of the restaurant and how many tv's there are. That's pretty much the only positive thing about this place. Came in with four other people and ordered two tanqueray and tonics for my gf and myself in tall glasses. Server brought two tall glasses but they were filled half way. Kind of defeated the purpose of ordering a tall glass. I didn't want extra gin just like it filled with tonic to the top. So I send it back to be filled with to tonic. Server brings it back I take a sip and it taste like nothing but soda water. She then proceeds to tell me they're tonic \"sucks\" so the bartender decided to fill it up with soda water instead. Really? Then I ordered the half smoked chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and collard greens. The mashed potatoes were sub par and cold with no flavor. Kfc's mashed potatoes are better. The collard greens were drowned in salt! Disgusting! The chicken was okay but I had to douse it in the sauce that's on the table. After still being a bit hungry i try the spinach dip and she brings dirty side plates. We then order a round of beers that you can't mess up you'd think right? Nope. Completely butchered our order and we had to send them all back as she didn't know what was what! This place blows. I'd be highly impressed if this place lasted more than a couple months. How can you open up a smokehouse and BBQ restaurant next to macs speed shop and expect to survive with horrible service and even worse food? Please save yourself the time and agony and go somewhere else. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Totally love this place! Went for my birthday lunch and was able to take my dog for outside seating. Without asking, they provided a bowl of water for her. The meal, Salmon over the most delicious potato cake, was absolutely delicious. Great food! Great ambiance! Great service!"}
{"text":"I actually want to give the place 2.5 stars, and I'm feeling nice today, so I'm rounding up instead of down.  When we entered, the sign is turned to the \"Please wait to be seated\" side, but when we wait and someone finally approaches, she says it's open seating. *face palm* So why not turn the sign around to the \"Please seat yourself\" side?!  We chose to sit on the porch outside, which is a nice area, especially considering the perfect weather the day we came. I ordered the brisket quesadilla. The food was okay, just average really. Tried some fries, which weren't seasoned evenly, but the ones that were seasoned were very good.  The most disappointing thing about the visit was our service, though. Our servers were friendly, sure, but not the best at giving us attention. Two in the party ordered coffee. When it came, she brought sugar but not creamer. It took quite a while for her to come to the outside area again and for us to flag her down. So much so that the coffee wasn't hot anymore by the time creamer did come. That was pretty much the trend of our visit. We needed something, but felt like the step-children in the corner waiting for someone to come around while our food got cold. At one point, my sister just had to get up herself and hunt down the server."}
{"text":"This use to be icehouse! Last year I use to come every Sunday for football! I was surprised this year when I came back and it was Bonz but it is owned by the same person so the place is pretty much the same they just changed the menu a little and the seating has changed! I had the quesadilla and it was delicious! I love this bar for Sunday's because they actually play all the games and they are pretty good about seating you next to a TV to watch your game which most other bars in Charlotte don't do! They are always so friendly!! The waitresses are awesome, they have always been friendly!! Very accommodating place! They also have good specials on Sunday's for football so you don't have to spend a ton of money!!"}
{"text":"We were fans of Icehouse and were hesitant of the change to Bonz at first. However, with the same staff and a tweaked menu, we were very pleased with the changes to the place.  Cara, one of the bartenders, is amazing though I've yet to meet anyone that works here that isn't extremely friendly and helpful.  The taco salad is delicious as well as the pulled chicken bbq salad. You'll end up requesting the bbq ranch just to drink!  If you haven't been or are hesitant after the change from Bonz, definitely stop in.   UPDATE: just had their wings. The dry rub is beyond amazing. Has brown sugar and cumin amongst others. BBQ sauce is great as well."}
{"text":"This used to be the icehouse but I guess they changed names. It seemed like the same below average food and soso beer menu. I got a burger and requested it to be medium, I should of known right then I would be disappointed. If they don't ask how you want it that means hockey puck. My burger was dry and didn't have enough sauce. Service was ok but nothing to wow me. I did find it strange that a place now touting BBQ has no smell of smoke except for cigarettes outside. I won't be going back until there is a new place with new ownership."}
{"text":"My co workers and I go here for lunch a lot.  The staff is fantastic.  The food is good and they have a good selection of beers.  I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Holy portions! Bonz not only had huge portions, but the food was delicious! We sat outside which was really nice. Nice, big patio with a bar and a few tv's which was perfect for football Sunday! It is definitely an upbeat, busy place so be prepared to see a lot going on...and dog friendly!  We started off with half a dozen wings - sweet and sour Sriracha sauce and blue cheese. YUM YUM YUM! We ordered the wings plain with the sauce on the side which was perfect because the sriracha definitely had a little kick to it, but it was just the right amount blended with the sweet taste.   I ordered the pulled pork plate...I have enough left over for dinner tonight. You get a pile of pulled pork, 2 sides(I got tater tots and macaroni and cheese-both amazing), toast, and coleslaw. Pulled pork comes plain, but there are 3 sauces on the table you can choose from, I ended up using the plain BBQ sauce which was fantastic.   My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork texas chips (nachos)- pulled pork, chips, onions, sour cream, salsa, cheddar jack cheese, jalapeños, cilantro, and house made queso. We have another full meal for dinner later! All the ingredients mixed together so well, just enough cheese and pulled pork to cover all the chips--I hate dry chips when I order nachos and these were no where near dry! These seemed to be the popular dish of the day too, almost every table on the patio had an order!   The service was mediocre at first, our waitress did not seem enthused to be at work and was not very talkative. But as the meal went on, she became more interested and was very attentive to us even with how busy it was.   This is definitely a delicious addition to South End and I look forward to going back to try some more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"What great place to be at especially the bar the Beautiful bartender that works there her name is jess absolutely fantastic behind the bar she is awesome everybody should come here to see her appetizers are great cocktails are awesome don't forget to come and see Jess,plus we just had the peel-n-shrimp they where fantastic , what great choice that Jess said to get,try this place it is awesome"}
{"text":"Good food and great portions.  Perfect for catching the game.  My faves were the wings, bread pudding, and collard greens (I expected them to be flavorless - but unless they were just having a great day- they were delicious to my surprise).  Service is a little slow - they always seem short on staff on their busiest days."}
{"text":"I came to Bonz midweek to watch the UNC/Dook game. My friends and I were seated immediately, although there was a decent crowd. The wings have a great smoky flavor and the dry rub was my favorite. It's an interesting combination of flavors with a little sugar and a little spice. Speaking of spice, the hot wings are HOT. So hot I could only eat one. My mouth was completely on fire and I gave them to a friend. I don't consider myself to have a low tolerance for spice, but these were another level. Beware! The service was average, but the waitress was pleasant. Last, but not least EVERY television was on the UNC/Dook game. Great if you're one of us. If not, be prepared to watch anyway."}
{"text":"So, the previous Yelp reviews have not been overly flattering. Bonz is a fairly new sports bar that took over the previous space for Ice House and before that SouthEnd Brewery.   I think the other reviews are not so good because of the food. And, well, you really don't come to Bonz IMHO for a gourmet meal but to hang out and watch a game (and perhaps enjoy some drinks and apps). As for watching a game, the TV viewing (they have a massive number of large TVs) and general set up is great. The bar décor is nicely done too.   I did order dinner and got a grilled chicken breast sandwich and mashed potatoes. Food was decent -- 3* but again, for an in-town sports BAR and overall sports bar experience, it's a nice place to be!"}
