{"text":"We just got take out from this restaurant and it was delicious! General Tso's and Triple Delight was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered Hunan Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken to go. Lady told us 15 mins and walked down to another store and come back in 10 mins or so. Order was ready to go on time and we drove three mins to the house.  When we got home both of the entrees were cold and you could tell immediately it was not cooked to order. The Hunan Chicken was very mild for a \"spicy\" dish according to the menu and it already had a glaze like it had been sitting around for an hour or so.  I had to microwave it up, but then decided to trash it.  Sweet Sour was not much better.

Will definitely go to King Yuan in Avon next time."}
{"text":"Ordered some food and sat and ate at a table with my daughter and wife. Owners are extremely nice and even brought out some sample things to try. Food was hot and brought out quickly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is much-improved with the new ownership. Better food and better customer service. We've liked every dish we've tried, which the exception of the Ma Po Tofu, as the sauce is really thick and gummy."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from China King 1 for the first time this week, and it was very good. The broccoli chicken was delicious, and the vegetables were cooked perfectly, which is not always the case with Chinese takeout. We asked that one of our entrees was made with only white meat chicken, and they had no problem honoring our request. Very friendly service, and the restaurant and kitchen areas looked very clean and well-kept. We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We got the General Tso's chicken  and the vegetable lo mein. Very good american-style style Chinese food!"}
