{"text":"Okay, so not only are the menu options crazy awesome the staff is equally awesome! After staring at and drooling over the menu for over 20 minutes, trying to decide on one thing to eat, (the options are endless), I landed on the Sweet and Sour chicken served with jasmine rice.   While I waited on my food I perused the drink menu and selected my drink of choice, Pookie's Punch.  Now, I'm not a big drinker but, I can never say no to a deliciously sweet cocktail.  Pookie's Punch certainly delivered.  I even had the pleasure of meeting the manager in which the drink was named after, thanks to my server.  Funny thing though, his name isn't Pookie.    Just as I finished off my drink my food arrived and I stuffed myself silly.  My food was so good I wanted to pick up my plate and lick it.  I'm sure my friend was grateful that I didn't.    In essence, what I'm trying to say is that if you haven't been to eeZ yet you need to go post haste.  Perhaps you'll run into me there!"}
{"text":"A favorite in the Birk. Their sushi is really great. I especially love their edamamme is steamed perfectly. It is my favorite of any place around. I like to get the spicy tuna roll with avocado and cream cheese. I'm not into all the crazy sea urchins but they have them there if that's your thing. Their menu is extensive. They are always crowded although who isn't in the Birk. The rolls are a bit pricey but I guess that comes with the territory.... location, location, location."}
{"text":"Great food, very nice environment, well priced, but inconsistent service. Waiting for a table outside can be painful. Not because there are none available, but because they take a long time before they clean and setup for the next customer. If you are hungry, you may just want to go inside and avoid the stress of looking at the empty tables outside."}
{"text":"As a personal favorite restaurant, along with all of my co workers as our restaurant of choice, it is very disappointing to hear you no longer take reservations. We do large parties of 10+ and first available doesn't cut it for us. While your food is amazing, think you lost some diners here. Bummer for both sides."}
{"text":"I really like Eez Fusion, the sushi there tastes fresh and service is great. Although, I have really come to appreciate it lately for their willingness to accommodate my dietary restrictions.   I have a compromised immune system and cannot eat raw fruits, vegetables, or meats. At first I thought this meant sushi was off the table forever, but when I came here I explained the issue (I know its not a common issue, like allergies) and the waiter was super helpful. I picked a sushi with shrimp tempura and the waiter let me know what that some items, like the sauce, had raw items and I was able to substitute or leave them off. I even had the manager come over once to be sure my needs were understood and followed. Because of them, I feel safe to enjoy one of my favorite foods again!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. Best sushi place I've been to. The manager was super nice to us. I took  my wife there for her birthday and we had a blast!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to eez more than 20 times.   Truly one of my favorite resturants.   One benefit is I can have sushi, Thai, etc... Without compromising quaility.   Try the Tom Yum soups and one their unquie rolls that come loaded with fresh fish, outstanding.     If you want one small example of the eez diference try their fried rice.   Call ahead the place is always busy, for good reason.     All the best."}
{"text":"I used to consider this THE place to go. The food, while good, cannot make up for the really, really lousy service. On a recent visit at lunch, my date and I sat at the empty bar. The bartender and manager completely ignored us. After 7 minutes or so, another gentleman sat at the bar. Another 5 minutes went by. Then the other guy got served. Waiting patiently, again ignored. The worst experience ever! I will never set foot in this establishment again. We left without eating."}
{"text":"What happened to  Eez? All four dishes we had tonight were sweet. Sad. It use to be one of our favorites."}
{"text":"It's pretty bad when you have a party of 6 and want to be seated at 6:00 on a Sunday evening and you are given every reason under the sun why the wait will be 1 hour and 45 minutes (that is what my text stated when we left our name for a table). There were 8 EMPTY tables in view of the waiting area...when asked about sitting outside where it was empty we were told that they were not seating in that area because there was a chance of rain (did not rain the entire night), when asked about the empty tables under the covered area we were told we could not sit there and join a 4 top table with a 2 top table because of a fire hazard...really??!?!? We said we would be happy then to separate our party of 6 into 4 and 2 we were told that couldn't be done because they would assign us separate servers. We said we would be happy to pay separately. We were then told there would still be an hour and 45 min. wait....there were 2 parties in the waiting area to be seated. It just seems they really don't want to accommodate their guests....you get the feeling they would just prefer that you leave. When my husband asked to see the manager....we found out the unpleasant hostess was the manager!!! Apparently there is a definite problem with the management of the restaurant. The restaurant was not nearly at capacity and they did not make you feel welcome. Usually  we love their food but that treatment was unacceptable.  Within 30 minutes we received a text that our table was ready....well, guess what, by then we had gone to another fabulous sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last Thursday for my birthday and as usual we were very happy with the food and service.  We had a few different rolls, the highlight being Miss Moffit's Roll- very good! The fish is all very fresh and tasty.  Thursday's they have half priced bottles of saki, which was a nice surprise.  We got the fried cheesecake for dessert. It was very good, but not as large as I thought it would be.  Based on the description I thought it would be a good amount of cheesecake and fresh fruit. It was more like 3 smaller \"rolls\" of cheesecake wrapped in wonton.  Still good, but it won't fill you up if you are still hungry and sharing it.   YUM!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would!!! It is my favorite place in the Charlotte area. Their sushi is absolutely wonderful not to mention the creativity and presentation of their fushion rolls! I go there (way tooooo often) on a regular basis and have never once been disappointed with my food or the service. I do have servers and bartenders that I am very partial to but with that being said, honestly they are all wonderful and work very very hard. Which brings me to my next comment about the management... I love going in there and being acknowledged. It's not just me or the fact that I'm there 2+ times a week, I see them greet all of their customers. I like that! I like to feel appreciated. I watched the managers jump right in on a busy night and run plates to tables. I can't say enough great things about EEZ!!! Overall, it's a 10!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I just had the best family reunion on Lake Norman and decided to stop for lunch before flying back home.  While shopping at Birkdale we happened upon this place.  Friendly faces greeted us at the door and considering they were busy for a Monday lunch we were seated right away.  Our waiter was friendly and prompt and explained the entire (extensive) menu to us.    Drink menu looked amazing.  My sister got The Hustleman (Hendrick's gin, muddled cucumber & pineapple and a splash of soda) which was cool, refreshing and yummy.  I ordered the mango tea (non-alcoholic) which was very refreshing and came with free refills.    We decided to split a couple of appetizers and sushi rolls because we just wanted a \"quick bite\".  The only downfall to the entire experience is that the waiter didn't warn us how large the portions were.  We ordered the sweet and spicy cucumber salad, Caribbean summer rolls, blackened ahi tuna nachos, spicy tuna roll and spicy yellow tail roll.    While everything was very good, I must comment that the cucumbers were not spicy at all.  The summer rolls were average but had the nice addition of mango.  The tuna nachos were absolutely amazing.  They are topped with their famous crab rangoon dip which I feel made the nachos over the top!!  I would definitely order that again and trip the amazing dip on its own.  The sushi was good and fish seemed extremely fresh but I think there was too much rice on the outside of the rolls.    All in all a great experience.  Also, we mentioned we were first time diners and they gave us coupons for free appetizers on our next visit!  I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The best sushi in Lake Norman! The service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Charlotte. The sushi is fresh and they have lots of creative options. I love the variety. Some of the rolls are pretty big, so bring your appetite.  I also love the stir fry bar. You can select your meat, your starch (rice or noodles) and a sauce. Then you get to go to the veggie bar and hand pick the veggies of your choice.  I ordered the shrimp and scallops; instead of the starch I doubled up on veggies and had them cook it in a peanut sauce.  Amazing!!  Also, make sure you try the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos as an appetizer. The tuna is fresh and the dish is very flavorful.   I prefer to sit on the patio and people watch. The accoustics in-doors are terrible. If the place is full you won't be able to hear the person across from you. I've even had waiters sit down beside me so they could hear me place my order (and I have a very loud voice :-)  Tuesday is one of my favorite days to go: they have $5 martinis on Tuesdays! Get the eez punch; it tastes like kool aid!! You can't even taste the alcohol. But don't drink it too fast; although you can't taste the alcohol, you'll defintely be able to feel it.    Random comment: I love the language lessons in the bathroom.  There is a recording that makes a statement in English and then repeats the statement in another language (I'm asumming Japanese???).  It's unexpected and it always makes me smile."}
{"text":"The food was great but I was very impressed with the service. They quickly cleaned an outdoor table so my wife and two children could eat. The waitress was very friendly and on top of her job. Anyone that knows me knows that it is a task just to keep up with my iced tea refills!  We had two bento boxes and the chicken satay app. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The menu is very extensive and everything that I have had has been good.  The atmosphere is great because you can eat outside, by the bar, or inside.  Eez really has something for everyone to enjoy even if you are not that in to Asian cuisine.  The only drawback for me is the price and that might have something to do with all the choices on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here. Crowded location but the sushi bar was open. Server was great. Sushi was very good. Very filling!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, Eezs!  We come all the time. Great service, great Sushi and Birdale is a litle area!!"}
{"text":"If they were cheaper it'd be 5 starts - the $18 rolls are worth about $12 (yes, even after the birkdale location factored in). Wait staff is usually good but once or twice I've had issues."}
{"text":"Winner! Winner! Sushi Dinner!  Fish was fresh and tasty. Great portions for a reasonable price. Service was top notch. Will definitely be back. Definitely a good option if your looking for a place to eat at Birkdale."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by the food or the service at Eez. I have friends from NY City that have thought it is excellent. The only problem is that it gets too crowded and sometimes the wait is just too long."}
{"text":"We have came here several times. Trying to follow the vegan diet is hard enough. There are several items to choose from ! Coconut based sauces, but we have always ordered the red curry dish. They have assured us, no animal products. Until last time we ate there, sorry we use shrimp paste in that. After going for 6 months, the trust is ruined and the food is getting sloppy and pathetic ! We tried once more today, yet they disappointed once again. Over charging, for less food !"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place a five is because it is a little on the pricey side. I usually only went here for lunch, and they have some pretty good deals. For lunch, the sushi comes with a salad (carrot ginger dressing is awesome!) or soup, and you can usually substitute any specialty roll with their regular lunch options. I always got the Double Salmon Roll and gobbled it up every time. The rolls are HUGE and their are very generous with the amount of fish they include in each one. Definitely a great place for lunch/date night."}
{"text":"We were on a sushi venture. Had to stop and try eeZ. The fish was fresh and light... Yummy !!! We think this place is over-rated and the prices are too high. If we could afford it we would come here for sushi more often. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area. I love the quality of their food.   I go here for their sushi while my boyfriend goes here for their stir fry dishes. They have a full bar that you can pick your vegetables and then they'll cook it for you.   Its located in a very nice shopping center and very well maintained. When you go into the restrooms it teaches you Chinese. You'll hear a guy saying an american word and then the chinese meaning of it. Kind of interesting. You come out of the bathroom learning a few chinese words. :)"}
{"text":"I can only rate based on the stir fry bar.  Yellow curry, tofu, and steamed jasmine rice = capital YES.  It's a little pricey but amazing and fresh.  Not prohibitively pricey so I can't really complain since it's a good portion size.  I could make this dish at home BUT there are plenty of combinations to try and the fact that I keep coming here for them to make it says a lot."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Nothing to rave about. The ambiance is really nice tho."}
{"text":"eeZ is slipping big time, in my opinion. They used to have AMAZING food and service and the owner and managers would come by and speak to you and confirm the meal was going well. Now the service is shit  the sushi is still great, and the management doesn't care anymore. All of the good waiters have left. Each time I go in I get angry because they don't care anymore. I used to go in once or twice a week. Now if I go in once a month it's a rarity. They lost a lot of respect in my book when they discontinued the half-off sushi late night. I was told it was because the waiters didn't like it. My waiters told me they did. The management also lied and said they'd bring back the discount this summer. Didn't happen.   My quick rundown- 4 on sushi quality, 2 service, 2 ambiance and atmosphere (changed restaurant decorations and it no longer fits the price range due to ambiance) and 1 on management. 1 overall. Used to be a 5 star place...sad."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Love the stir fry bar and all of the different options. It is a bit pricey but it's worth it. Love the ginger salad and spring rolls too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Firecracker sushi roll is my favorite roll anywhere. They have a great ambience, a nice variety on the menu and excellent food. You can't go wrong...unless you go on Friday/Saturday and the wait is 2 hours. But other than it being crowded sometimes, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"As for flavor and menu variety, they are pretty good.  They also have a great children's menu and are very patient with very young children.  We ate sushi when we were there, and were very surprised by what they have to offer.  Their rolls are VERY expensive-  prices from $18-$28 come to mind.  However, the rolls are 2-3x the size of a typical sushi roll.  A little heavy on the rice, so their sushi chef may be new to the trade.  The downside to serving sushi this way is you can't order 2-3 usual-sized rolls and taste several flavors.  You either commit to one roll, or you go with a sizeable group and each order something different so you can try other flavors.    Unless you like throwing away food, or eating day-old sushi if you take home leftovers, it's not a great place to go for variety.   Also worth mentioning-  our server had never served anywhere before.  She didn't know the menu, she had to be prompted by the manager to check on our table, and she neglected our drink order until after our food had started to be brought out.  We went at a usual dinner hour, 7:00, and yes, they were busy.  But, they should be prepared to serve drinks immediately, not 25 minutes after you've ordered them.  The manager apologized, comped a portion of the meal, and gave us coupons for appetizers if we decide to return."}
{"text":"Good not amazing.  A nice restaurant with a blend of Thai & Japanese  If you're looking for traditional assortment of sushi rolls to share this isn't quite it (no complementary miso soap and salad).  2 of us split 3 rolls (Nirvana, scorcher and build your own).  Rolls are pretty big and heavy but the ingredients seemed fresh and good blend of flavors and textures.  I would be most likely to get another build-your-own or Nirvana again.  Not the best value at about $70 for 3 rolls and 2 beers.  Outdoor seating is heated in winter but the plastic enclosure and metal chairs are not as nice ambiance as inside."}
{"text":"I went here with family for dinner on Monday night. There were 5 of us. We had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated. They put us at a wide booth for 4 and we had 1 chair for the 5th person.   Our waiter was very nice. He explained a couple of things on the menu and we ordered our drinks, meals and appetizers. The drinks cake out quickly and tasted good. The apps were decent. We got edamame which seemed over cooked and spring rolls which were unevenly shaped (two cam in an order and they were not the same length).  We got mostly sushi which tasted very good. I got the boss roll which was large, but good.  Overall, the restaurant was clean and attractive. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday and had sushi.  I really enjoyed it and will be back.  The fish was fresh and the rolls were done well.  I wanted to try sake and the brought me tastes of their fruit infused ones, which were all bad.  I was hesitant about buying a $20 bottle of non-infused sake in case I hated it but I think I may next time.  It's too bad they don't have a taster order but I guess they may not go through it fast enough to have bottles to try."}
{"text":"Sushi was only ok food was slightly above average. Prices were too high because of that. Sorry but wouldn't spend money here again. Restaurant was nice though."}
{"text":"I love Eez, been coming here forever. However, the past 3-4 times I sat down here, the service has been absolutely terrible. We sat down for lunch around 1:45, it is currently 3:15 and I am still waiting on a to go order that I placed with my original order. The food here is always good, but I will probably never sit down here again because of the consistently bad service I have gotten."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Huge portions! Amazing selection...bento boxes, and stir fry a favorite! Shlay our waitress was a doll, attentive and Gave fabulous suggestions.. The Manager Matt Brown was top notch .. Even with the back up because of weather he went above and beyond to make sure we got seated with our family outside to have a great meal and enjoy the breeze! Every time I visit Huntersville, Ezz is on the list of something we MUST do!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, make your own stir fry very heavy on the sauce. Couldn't taste the vegetables.   Chicken teriyaki dinner good but expected it to be cut up like a stir fry but it was a breast. Still good taste. Kids bento boxes really good."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and were told to go to Eez by many people. We did and glad we went!   We started with the Crab Ragoon dip which was great! We then had 3 different very large rolls - The Boss, Julie and Firecracker all recommended to us by our awesome server KC. All 3 were delicious and we'd order them again for sure! Our meal ended with the Peanut butter pie. My husband loved it!   We will be back and will ask for KC! The only reason it's not a 5 star is because there is a good 40 minute wait if you don't have a reservation."}
{"text":"Eeze is crazy.  Kitchen/buyer don't care (no salmon skin for the crispy salmon skin - is the seafood \"fresh\"), waitress is unfriendly...as though I am in a soup kitchen, and the chef's specialty is way off...does anyone love peppers cut so big - medium raw...?  Eeze - you were a star years ago - now not so much.  Cucumber-tini and the waiter...nice."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to! The menu offers almost any combination of sushi as well as wok dishes. Fresh, delicious, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Eat here several times a month. Delicious, good value for money, friendly staff. Would highly recommend for sushi!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh ingredients & decent prices. I usually do the stir fry, you get a bowl to pile high with your choice of fresh veggies from the bar & your choice of meat & noodles. Big portions so there are usually leftovers which is a plus. Service has always been excellent...prompt & knowledgable staff. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I regret that I waited 30 minutes for a table. When we walked to be seated after our ringy-dingy went off and saw 6 empty tables that would of held our party, we should of expected that there was something wrong.   Food was ok. Really bad staff. Way too  young and unprofessional for the cost of the food. As the meal progressed the service just got worse and worse.  I would not recommend. ."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a following but I am not overly impressed.  The sushi is overpriced and the wait staff can be less than helpful.  Personally I feel this restaurant would not be as popular if it were nto for being located in Birkdale Village.  I drive past Eez to go to the better sushi restaurant in Huntersville."}
{"text":"The sushi was great.  The blackened Mahi Mahi  tacos were outstanding.  Allison was a great server.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed in the food or service, only complaint is the always long wait because it is so popular. They've been very accommodating for large groups, children, and date nights."}
{"text":"While visiting family in Huntersville, my brother had a birthday and wanted to go to eeZ for dinner. I'm so glad he recommended this restaurant because it was fantastic!  We started with the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos, after reading so many great reviews about them. They were amazing! I wish I wouldn't have had to share with everyone else at the table.   For my entree, I ordered a House Bento Box with Kung Pao Chicken and a California Roll. The chicken was so good! The flavor was excellent and the roll was delicious too.   The only complaint I have is that the food is quite expensive for what you get. I can't imagine spending $20 for an 8 piece roll, but I can definitely see why it would be worth it to most people. The food is incredible and you get what you pay for.   I've been dreaming about those nachos since we ate there. I'm thinking I might need to go back one more time before I go back home!"}
{"text":"My fist time ever getting sick from Sushi was after eating the Tasmanian Devil Roll last Saturday night at Eez.  This roll is supposed to be the premium cuts of Tuna and Salmon.  The last 36 hours have been miserable for me.  I hope that they review their procedures so that this does not happen to anyone else. Of course, I will never be returning.  Too bad because I had been there several times before and had positive experiences."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place by far. Awesome sushi, Good environment and good service. I would frequent more but it is pricey. Just makes me enjoy it that much more when I do get to go though! Usually way crowded so plan for that or go early or late."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular service...food was good. Great social atmosphere. A lot of fun."}
{"text":"You ask for the nicest manage ever!! Our server was So-so!! Not a friendly guy at all! The food was good, but can anyone say Salt???  The atmosphere was very snobby and i do frequent some fine restaurants, but this was a very \"wanna be\" type.. The music Was blasting and it wasn't good music at all!!! Probably won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great sushi!  And a great staff.  Actually a better place the our old standby sushi@TL.  But bring lots of $$$.  Firecracker Roll = well worth trying."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi places in the area.. I've been to Eez several times and its been consistently good food.."}
{"text":"Eez is a fantastic place for Asian fusion. Be forewarned,it's a little pricey, but the portions are ENORMOUS -- even the sushi rolls. I came here and ordered an appetizer before my email and the appetizer was so big I could barely touch my main course. The servers are extremely friendly and will help you with the menu. The Bento Box is one of my favorites because it gives you a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Sushi could be a bit better, too much rice for our taste.  Great service Try the tuna tacos!"}
{"text":"Is it just me or is this place on a slow decline in terms of menu selection and food quality?  I Still like it, but it's no longer great. The waitress was very nice and both her and the manager made a point of asking us how everything was... but we just smiled and said \"great!\"' I couldn't bring myself to complain. We'll be back, but with lower expectations. (Food was drowning in sauce, over cooked, mushy noodles, new and unimproved dumplings :( grotesquely large portions, poorly cut vegetables)."}
{"text":"For the price the place is i was very disappointed with the food. I rather go to sushi at the lake which is 5 min drive from there and eat cheaper and much better."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you have a group of people with different tastes...you can feed kids and picky adults here. There seems to be something on the menu for everyone.  We love the pad tai  and the sushi here-as well as the lettuce wraps.  You get large portions (and can easily share most dishes).  The staff are well trained and very polite and helpful.  Great job."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places! It's amazing and fresh! And you can make your own sushi rolls for those of you that don't like the big chunky raw pieces of fish in you sushi! If you go here after dinner you should walk down to kilwins for"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Birkdale by far! Great sushi rolls... However... The bento box is my favorite because it lets you try a little of each bit of deliciousness! Love the cucumber salad especially. Have always had great service and helpful, friendly servers every time I've gone over the years. Both service and food has never declined which is always awesome to find in a restaurant. It's nice there's both indoor and outdoor seating for the summer nights you want to be outdoors."}
{"text":"love this place, good food,great service,worth the wait on the weekends,"}
{"text":"I went this past weekend and really enjoyed it. Its really nice to go some where that you have heard great things about and it really is great!  I was able to enjoy building my own Sushi Roll, the staff was excellent in helping make my choices."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's  located in the birkdale outside mall, which is real pretty. The food was amazing. The service was amazing. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Traveling in town for work. Came to Eez with a colleague for 5$ Martini night, which is on Tuesdays. It was delicious!! Neat little place in Birkdale village. They have a huge menu which includes sushi. They even have customizable rolls!!! Love that option. I had the mango-Cado tempura roll. I would give it A+. Shrimp tempura, I swapped out the Kani for tuna. Mango and avocado. From the martini menu: they were all amazing. I had a pineapple express made w sake, a dirty martini, and a chocolate fortune cookie martini. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our go to for date night. Eez is always consistent-great food and great service. They're very accommodating with any modifications you may need and they don't seem to have a high turnover rate with their staff which speaks for the management. Love Eez!"}
{"text":"Why are there children seated at the bar? I find this inappropriate. Such a great restaurant and I know seats are at a premium, but a bar isn't the right to lace to have children."}
{"text":"When someone asks me a good place to go for sushi in Charlotte, I recommend Nikko's but I think after going to Eez, my answer is going to change.   I've heard great things about Eez but am never really up in that area but was for an event and was excited I was finally able to go. They literally had two pages full of sushi selections (I am talking Cheesecake Factory length menus).I got Mark's Roll-Fresh tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, kani and scallion roll, coated with panko and flash fried. Topped with Japanese cream sauce and sriracha. Served with ponzu dipping sauce along with the TNT Roll-Spicy tuna, kani, avocado and fish roe   Both were absolutely terrific and I really liked the atmosphere, it was dimly lit with Japanese inspired art and lighting fixtures and had great upbeat music playing. Plus they have have late night half priced sushi at 11P so I will need to hit this place up again if I am in the area. I don't think I am going to be in that neck of the woods for any specific reason but will make something up just to go there again."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite local spots as the staff is always quick and polite and the food always delicious. We ordered the Calamari and Pot Stickers which were perfectly cooked and the calamari wasn't chewy at all. I had the bento box with Szechuan chicken and it was sweet and spicy. If I had one complaint about it, the chicken was a wee bit overdone and the sauce was a tad on the salty side. The pickled cucumbers were a great palate cleanser and the jasmine rice was a wee bit dry and may need a little rice wine vinegar or something. My sister had sushi which she claimed was amazing. As for the grand finale, the banana's Foster is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good Food, High Prices.  The sushi is great, not a lot of rice, and decent cuts of fish.  Sashimi is great cuts of fish.  Try the all eyes on you roll and calamari appetizer!"}
{"text":"Had an tasty chicken & pineapple rice plate. It was also good quantity for the price. Only downside was the service. I don't think I've ever been snubbed, but the hostess sat people that came in after me. My waitress also never checked on me after delivering my food. I just ate the last 10 minutes without a drink."}
{"text":"A lot of interesting combinations to choose from. Waiter was super accommodating with my picky daughter."}
{"text":"I eat here literally once or twice a week. The absolute best sushi I've ever had. Their fusion dishes are wonderful too. My fave drink is the pear mule! The service is always top of the line and although on weekends there is a bit of a wait, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"We have been to Eez many times. It's one of our favorites for celebrations such as birthdays.  The mixed drinks are awesome and they have a nice wine and beer selection also.  The service is always good to great, really depending on the time and how busy they get. Friday and Saturday evenings expect to wait for a table. We always try to slip into the bar area although it's not always possible.  It's a great place to sit outside and people watch in nice weather. Parking can be a problem. My suggestion is go there for lunch or before 5 PM to avoid these parking and waiting problems.  We especially like to design our own sushi and they always have very fresh ingredients.   My one recommendation is don't get the stir fry bar. My experience is that the vegetables are not fresh especially the squash, zucchini, yellow onions and carrots. The sauce I had (Shu swan) was not at all spicy as advertised (3 peppers) and you don't get to select the quantity of meat or sauce (as in some Mongolian style restaurants). Thus the 4 star rating verses 5.  I have had good and bad experiences with the entrees (my problem is with the flavor of sauces) but the sushi is always first rate.   The Bento box is a great lunch selection which includes a sampling of edamame, Thai cucumbers and jasmine rice, 4 pieces of sushi (Select from 12 options at different prices) and lunch size portions of an entrée (select from nine choices).  I feel for the price it's a great place to meet friends for sushi and drinks and a fun place to people watch."}
{"text":"Great sushi. My wife had a infuego roll which was nice and spicey. I had a mad mango roll with was nice and sweet. The 2 together made for nice balance. Our waitor did a nice job suggesting meals to our group of 4. He really knew the menu well. The service was a bit slow but the food was excellent. I don't think I've ever eaten a sushi roll as fast as I did here."}
{"text":"Food was top notch, lots of vegan options. Server was friendly. Outside seating was nice. Has to send back the lettuce for another wash, totally cool with it though - I'd take pesticide free lettuce any day."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cowfish and I really like Eez! Stopped in for a quick lunch today. Pulled up a stool at the bar. For good service that was quick and efficient. Started with the veggie eggrolls, which were full of flavor and had a nice spicy sauce on the side for dipping. For lunch I had a sushi lunch special roll, which came with soup or salad, so I went with the wonton soup and the rainbow roll for the roll. Both were great. Loved the flavor of the soup and the freshness of the rainbow roll. The drips of sauce on the roll were a nice change from the \"lathered\" sauce you get sometimes with specialty rolls.   Same owners of Cowfish (Eez was first), and the menu is just a big, but without the burger part. If you're near Birkdale, it's a must visit."}
{"text":"OK let me start this review with a preface of where are in the process of moving to the Huntersville area. So i have not had any other sushi place yet, I am using comparisons to the places i have around me in CT. I will start with sat at the bar because for a Saturday night it had a 45 minute wait the sushi bar and regular bar were first come first serve we just happened to luck out when it came to getting a seat at the bar. Bartender Dustin was great he  said he was from Nashua NH. I believed him because nobody really knows where Nashua is. We start off with the sear tuna nachos which are basically fried won-tons with crab rangoon dip on them and some sprouts with seared ahi. I would say it was pretty good for what it was the  crab rangoon dip is very rich because of the cream cheese but still good nonetheless. we then had there seaweed salad which was OK i prefer mine spicier then they prepared it. My saving grace was the sriracha that was on the bar as a condiment so that allowed me to kick it up. The bartender again was very attentive to us even gave us two shots of sake with Raspberry liquor which was very good. The roll we got was a suggestion from the bartender, are we getting the common theme here damn good bartender.  Lots of fish on it very very favorful and fresh tasting fish, I would definitely get it again. i will probably will seeing as this is the only sushi place i know so far. We also got the edamame which were pretty good nice and salty and hot we kept eating because we had no where to go and didn't really want to just go and sit in the hotel. After the edamame and a few more beers and ginger margarita that my wife was drinking we decided lets eat more... So we got the spicy potstickers, they weren't really spicy but they had enough flavor to them that you knew they were supposed to be spicy. Good food good drinks good bartenders and service all our food came out hot and fresh. The people are so freaking nice down in North Carolina its almost sickening. I will definitely be returning Eez the menu is so stupidly big i didn't even dent it."}
{"text":"That's a nice place to go on a date. The atmosphere is calm and the playlist is eccentric. The Blackened Tuna Roll is so far my favorite. It's amazing how the guacamole makes the difference :)"}
{"text":"For those that live in the village will tell you the best food is Eez. This is not traditional sushi or Asian cuisine, but it's wonderful. Amazing spin on Asian and American."}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch that was a bento box in a great shopping and walking area. I would definitely consider going back."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Great restaurant. Best in Huntersville area"}
{"text":"I love Eez!  I go any chance I get. The sushi is awesome and my favorite is the Tuna-Tini appetizer. Fresh ahi tuna and avocado.  The servers are always top notch and friendly. The outdoor seating is great for people watching."}
{"text":"So, snap obviously knows the owners of the restaurant.  Just signed in to rate 1 restaurant and say it was the best sushi in the US, LOL!  Good sushi, nice Asian fusion cuisine.  Patio is very chill, and nice staff.  Food is great, but not 5 stars great."}
{"text":"the crab rangoon dip. brace yourself! best ever! i love it here."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my mom and daughter. Staff is super friendly.  Many of the staff members greeted us as we were seated. Food was excellent. Highly recommend the lobster eggrolls. Wonderful place and wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Eez for years now. It's one of my family and friends favorite go-to spots to eat within the Charlotte and surrounding areas. The atmosphere is great (albeit a little loud during the dining rush hour). Their decor is ever updating and changing, and really suits the style of restaurant in my opinion. Their table settings are always well done, their bar is centrally located in the front with a variety of classic and fun new drinks always well stocked. Their staff has always been very upbeat, attentive and knowledgeable about specials and new things, and they aren't afraid to suggest and help you pick if you're a little unsure of what you might like.  The food however, is beyond amazing. I've never eaten something here I didn't immensely enjoy. Seriously though, their miso soup is always tasty. I love their seaweed salad, it's one of the best I've ever had, very fresh, with a light (non-overpowering) vinaigrette. Their bento boxes (fully customizable) are always fun to mix and match and you can't go wrong with the stir fry bar. All of their salads have been phenomenal as well, always fresh, always crisp, always delightful to the taste buds.   A few of my favorites however: 1) Their \"Moriawase Double Deuce\" is heavenly. It contains California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and one each of tuna, whitefish, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp and kani. If you want to try something and know your basics, start here, and ask for a taste of all their various dipping sauces! 2) Their \"Spicy Szechuan Chicken\" is beyond amazing. You can ask them to tone it down if you must, but served as is, especially if you enjoy a bit of bite, is seriously good. The vegetables that you can order with it are pretty tasty too, but seriously, A+ there. 3) My daughter loves the \"Oodles of Noodles\", it's basically a mini bento box, served with all kinds of kid-friendly goodies, lo mein noodles and grilled chicken with sweet teriyaki sauce to name the main bits. 4) Another favorite, and by far the most fun thing I've seen on their menu for children is the \"PB&J Sushi Roll\", which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like - peanut butter and jelly rolled up in white bread and cut to look like little mini sushi rolls. If you have a picky eater, you can't go wrong there.  Now if you're still reading, I would like to point out one very important and often forgotten fact of the food world -- a lot of people, have food allergies. My Mom is actually allergic to a very large list of items, two of the main being eggs and yeast. Now to those of you that love to eat, and like to know what exactly it is you're eating I'm sure are well aware that there aren't many foods out there that don't contain one or the other, so we have to be very careful when ordering. I'd just like to say, for those of you that do have allergies, severe or otherwise, Eez has always been more than happy to check, double and triple check the ingredients in anything we've ever ordered, and if there was a work around to make it differently for my Mom, they were always happy to oblige.  The only downside I can really think of is that they don't offer reservations after certain hours of the day (if at all anymore, you would need to call to see). The only true negative I can currently think of is the fact that parking is very difficult to find throughout Birkdale Village, so if you have elderly or disabled (while the restaurant itself is perfectly suited for the accessibility of the latter) you might want to drop them at the door, because you will be walking unless you luck out.  So, all that said, thank you Eez for always being such a delightful place to stop in at to grab a ridiculously tasty bite to eat, with your indoor/outdoor dining options, and your courteous staff."}
{"text":"The menu is so large here it took us forever to decide on what we wanted! I give them credit for the unique options and the \"fusion.\" My husband went with a bento box, which includes a taco, four sushi rolls, thai cucumbers, edamame, and jasmine rice. It was much bigger than I expected it to be and is a great way to try a little bit of everything. I ordered the double salmon rolls (because I am a salmon LOVER) and the TNT rolls with spicy tuna, kani, avocado and masago.Rolls here are relatively pricey but they are big. We went in on a monday night where they also offered half-priced house cocktails as a drink special. However, I was very disappointed in my cocktail. I believe there was no alcohol in it, or a very little amount. I guess this is how they get by with half-priced cocktails. I got the Strawberry Gravitron with gin, strawberries and lime, so they say. However, I'm convinced it was just club soda because there was no alcohol taste and it was pretty bland. Anyway, fortunately the food was good, and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"Started coming here 11 years ago. Went back last night after not going for several years. Food is excellent. Better than I remembered. Servings are big enough to eat 3 times! I ordered the Szechuan chicken with a sushi roll bento box.  Fantastic.   Will make an effort to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Eez. It is my favorite place to go for sushi, drinks and anything funky and eclectic with an Asian flair. I love to go for lunch, girls nite out, you name it. The sushi is a little on the expensive side but the portions are great. I enjoy the \"fusion\" of items they put together. The specialty martinis are delicious as well. My favorite is the magnificent mango and the fortune cookie. I highly recommend Eez if you are looking for something a little different from the normal sushi joint."}
{"text":"Best sushi experience I've had, hands down. While they are almost always packed, I have really never had poor service. Cocktails are great. Get the tuna nachos if you're looking for a great app (add siracha for bonus points). All of their specialty rolls are incredible and fresh. If you're truly starving, grab a bento box. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fine, but the prices were just insane. So much more expensive than other sushi place in the area, and I think Sabi is much better. I would go somewhere else in birkdale if you're looking to have dinner there. The bento box is your best bet though if you are bound and determined to eat here. The location is definitely convenient, though. Another problem is that their menu is way too big. There is no way they can be great at all those rolls, so it can be hit or miss. They should trim their menu to just those items they really excel at."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place. This last time was so good!!! We both asked for the rainbow roll, mine came with  seaweed salad (very tasty and refreshing.) My girlfriend's came with a spicy cucumber salad (also very tasty, not very spicy and sweet flavor.) I would recommend this place any time. Service has been excellent so far. Excellent romantic atmosphere, contemporary Asian style. Dinner prices are a little high, but the portions are big. Lunch prices are more moderate, but again they include a delicious side salad."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with either friends or family. Definitely a family friendly restaurant and a good place to catch up with friends. We sat for quite some time without anyone rushing us out. It can get very busy though for dinner especially during the weekends. The food is okay. I've tried the bento boxes which are pretty typical. The sushi is good but I feel like there's just too much stuff in it and overpowers the fish rather than complimenting it. It's like they try to deep fry it or smother it with sauce so you can't tell if the fish is fresh or not. Not exactly my go to for delicious sushi or other assorted asian food but good place to socialize."}
{"text":"Amazing, extensive sushi roll menu.  I ordered the North Quack-a-lacky roll which is a portabella mushroom, asparagus, cucumber and scallion roll, topped with thinly sliced marinated duck breast, fresh avocado, crunchy rice pearls and drizzled with sweet sauce to finish.  I have never had duck in a sushi roll before and decided to take a leap of faith.  It was DELISH, the duck had this smokiness that was not overwhelming and balanced well by the portabella mushroom.  I also loved the little crunchy rice pearls, which growing up eating sushi I had never seen before.  I admit I was skeptical about duck sushi, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.    Would have given this place 5 stars, but at almost $20 for a roll, the prices are steep.  They do have a late night special of half off rolls from I think 10:30pm or 11pm on.  Luckily we all shared our rolls so I got to try some other ones.  It's also pretty loud so I could barely hear the conversation at the table and felt the need to shout.    Sidenote: Going to the restroom is an educational experience, their \"music\" is an instructional Chinese tape, guess there's a first for everything!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit and I wanted to like this place since I go to Cowfish on a regular. Oh well, I now see why the email club gets $7 off. Well, I came for Saturday lunch and it was steady,but not extremely busy. Took a few minutes for the hostesses to notice customers since they were engaged in their own conversations and horseplaying. Strike one.  My server took my drink order and disappeared. By the time she came for my order, I had thought about changing my mind. Hate having to ask for refills-- a good server is attentive and anticipates. Strike two.  Although they are sisters, the rolls here just are not as well put together or tasty.Strike three.  Server brings my check and I am out. Methinks my first time will also be my last."}
{"text":"There were five of us in our group and we had dinner at Eez Fusion on Sunday night around 7pm.  When we got there the place was busy but it wasn't slammed.  Our server, Phelps (really sweet guy!), was great with us and took the time to answer our questions on the menu and help us figure out what to get.  He was very friendly, very willing to accommodate our multiple requests, and he was so willing to make sure we were happy with our entrees.  Midway through our meal, they gave Phelps a LARGE table adjacent to ours with about twenty people!  He juggled both groups effortlessly and never once seemed to lose his cool.  I don't know how he did it but he didn't miss a beat.  As someone who has waited tables in the past (pathetically might I add!), I have a lot of respect for a server who can multitask to that extent and maintain the same level of service as with smaller parties.  If you're the Manager of Eez reading this, please give Phelps a bonus or something, he seriously deserves it!  Even after getting totally tied up with such a massive table, he still checked on us and was fantastic with us!  Ok the food.  Thanks to Phelps I gave soya a try for the first time in a Thai dish, and loved it.  It's a meatless substitute you can order that has a semi-chicken texture and is high in protein and calcium.  I had their vegetarian curry with brown rice and really liked it.  The dish was slightly dry so when I asked for a side of curry sauce and added it in, it was just right.  The soya was a hit and really gave the meal substance.  My friends all seemed happy with their food too, because when I looked at their plates most of their food was gone!   The atmosphere is clean and contemporary with cherry finish tables and bright wall paint that is somehow still soothing and inviting.    They take online reservations at opentablecom.  Parking is pretty easy as there are plenty of spots in Birkdale Commons.  Lastly, nice fusion food and fairly extensive menu, of Thai and sushi options."}
{"text":"Sashimi was extremely fresh, presentation was beautiful and the server was very sweet. The Blackened Tuna Nachos are beyond amazing."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good, but definitely way way way overpriced. Their tuna was high quality, and their rice was well-cooked.  Was about to order the edamame as an appetizer until I saw it at the next table over -- I've never seen dark brown edamame before and suspect it wasn't fresh. We ordered the lettuce wraps and thought they were a poor imitation of PF Chang's (no crunchy element, chicken/veggies chopped so large that the lettuce wasn't really necessary). Their plating and table settings also left a lot to be desired (seriously, and I am usually wowed by the creativity of restaurants when it comes to plating). Drinks were reasonably priced, and they had a good beer selection (though they were out of at least 3 beers on the menu by the time we got there ... not sure if that's a regular problem).  This is a great location and could be a great restaurant if they refine their menu a little more. As it is, it's a decent (though small) bar area that sells overpriced sushi. I think their biggest problem is that they offer too much -- jack of all trades, master of none."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi! I've been here many many times and every time I go it's amazing! Last night I had the Dominator which was absolutely delicious if you like tempura style. My friend had the Southpark roll which was spectacular! Our waiter was also amazing!!! He recommended the bananas fosters for dessert which we devoured!!! One of the best desserts I've had! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a really unfortunate case.  Back a year or two ago it was really fantastic but that isn't the story anymore.  Many reviews will say they are great but that is only bc of it's great location and it being seen as a cool place to eat.   Here is the real scoop:  The sushi is mediocre bc the rice is always gummy.  Fish tastes good but the rice really ruins it.   Special creme brullees are offered weekly or monthly and I have yet to have a DECENT one.  Texture and flavors are always way off.   Crab rangoon dip was a saving grace but after having it last weekend I'll never order it again.  Very little crap and there was a disgusting spoiled fish taste to it.  Service is CONSISTENTLY awful.  Door greeters are dummy teenie boppers and wait staff is ok depending on who you get.    I would go to a japanese express before Eez again.  Sushi at the lake, Coral, Kobe Hero, and Edomae all have better sushi and more reasonable prices (although the service at edomae is actually worse than Eez)."}
{"text":"As my rating suggests, I'm ok with Eez.  The two times I've been, I was seated promptly. They aren't a huge restaurant, but they do have a dedicated sushi bar area.  The staff are great & the resturaunt is clean. Generally, it's not too noisy.  The food is ok, I've only gotten sushi - the Mark's roll & rising sun. The portions are plentifu & presentation is perfect.  Ekkk though, they are pricey! Luckily I'm in love with their sister restaurant, The Cowfish. : )"}
{"text":"Earlier in the day he said he wanted sushi, so I picked this place. We went on a Saturday night and it was busy but our wait wasn't too long.  First, this place is located in such a wonderful shopping area. It was our first time in the area and we were so impressed with the shopping and eateries. When we were told our wait would be 30-40  minutes, we didn't mind because it gave us the opportunity to just walk around and see what else was nearby.   When our table was ready we were seated promptly and our waiter, Michael, came over right away. We told him it was our first time here and to give us his suggestions from the menu. Micheal thoroughly highlighted the different sections of the menu giving us his suggestions from each. I had already had an idea of what I wanted us to try based on previous reviews and pictures and Michael basically suggested all of the dishes I wanted to order.  We went with the crab and lobster spring rolls. The cilantro pesto that came with those was incredible. It was such a different flavor profile from the typicaly sweet sauce served with spring rolls. A sweet sauce is also served with them, but we LOVED the cilantro pesto best.  We also ordered the seafood fried rice. (We split everything.) The portion of the rice was ridiculous! I couldn't imagine ordering that for one. Well, I could and just eat very well for three additional days. They didn't skimp on the scallops, shrimp or lobster. There were veggies in there and it was just a really great friend rice. We are going to try the chicken and pineapple rice next time.  And then we went with the All Eyes on You rolls. Those things had me dancing in my seat. Mmmmmmmmmmm, that's all I have to say about those.  What made our dining experience here top notch was the people who worked there. Yes, the food is AMAZING, but when everyone is so nice, it just makes you want to race home and write a review. Our waiter Michael was so nice and he even made the Thai coconut tea on ice for me, and then one of the managers, Emily came to the table. She just came by to ask how everything was and she heard it was our first time dining with them and gave us a couple of cards. Whenever we dine out and a manager comes by just to say \"hello\" and \"thank you\" that's so HUGE! How often does that happen, without you complaining?!?! Exactly...so Eez has been moved to our \"favorites\" on Yelp, and will be our \"go-to\" place for Asian food. I can't say enough great things about this place.   You really MUST go and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4.5 if i could.   The ambiance is pretty cool, complete with outdoor seating. Their menu is plentiful, but I have been so satisfied with what I order that I never strayed from the same meal every single time. I'm a vegetarian and having a soya option (way better texture than tofu) is a dream come true.   My favorites:   The create your own sushi option - If you have friends that still think sushi means 'raw fish' - have them create this combo - tempura zucchini, cream cheese, cucumber, fresh mint, avocado and top with spicy cream sauce and tempura flakes. What you'll end up with is a gigantic roll with a rich creamy, crunchy cool flavor and a new sushi fan.   The stir fry bar! - They are more than happy to mix sauces for you and you can pick all your veggies and stuff them into a bowl. I am usually able to pack the bowl pretty well, but have seen them not even flinch if people use two bowls for the veggies - That's how you keep customers!   Service is great and the staff are very polite and cheerful. The area can get packed and parking can be a little cumbersome if you've never been to Birkdale before, but its well worth it.   Oh and sign up for specials to be emailed to you, they are great deals!   I've since moved out of NC, but am reminded of great times and great meals here every time I receive my email specials."}
{"text":"So good! One of my family's favorite places! If you like Asian fusion, eez is a must!"}
{"text":"Stopped in during the weekday in the afternoon. The restaurant was nice, clean and smelled good. I had a $29 sushi combo, and I was not impressed. That was the only dish I tried, and I cannot speak on anything else. I doubt I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"My Fav. Never disappoints.  Excellent service. Go w the specials. Can't lose w this menu !"}
{"text":"Easily the best Restaurant in the Huntersville area. Great sushi and service."}
{"text":"I haven't been here but six months and so far this is my go-to place for sushi....although i can say its the best I've ever had. I have been quite a few times by myself, and with friends, so I've tried multiple items. i would say that the Tunatini is my favorite go to dish. My mother tried a deep-fried chicken dish that i thought was waaay too sweet adn i don't know how she ate it but she loved it....i guess if you like sweet food.I have had a few of the specially rolls. I'm not big on too much rice to fill up on i would prefer more substance in the rolls and less rice since they charge twenty dollars a roll.(a little overpriced in my opinion.) I i asked for a few extra shiso leaves and they brought me yellow spotty ones...? why? The Watermelon radish are a nice touch and pretty to look at and healthy. The coconut soup is too sweet. Once,i sat at the bar since i was alone, but i couldn't read the menu because it was too dark and the lights don't aim onto the menu or bar-top so i had to borrow the waiters phone flashlight to read which was embarrassing. It is also extremely LOUD. The bartenders are too busy to be nice or attentive. The menu is like a five page book ,so you should be able to find something for everyone. i was also disappointed that they didn't have any draft \"wheat beer\" options....only bottle which i don't like. They are always busy and the outside seating is nice. It is right next to the movie theater so you can time it right and check out the latest flick across the street."}
{"text":"I love this place especially on Wednesday nights with my group of tennis friends ordering half-priced bottles of wine. What a fun time with the ladies. I also love going there to meet other friends and family for sushi before going to see a movie or to simply shop. Eez is so easy to please, to dine, and to be happy. It is in an excellent location within walking distance to many shops, restaurants, starbucks and wine bar. The service and the people are wonderful. Always a fun time to come here at any day of the week."}
{"text":"The sushi was good and the tuna was super fresh! There was no fishy smell like many other sushi restaurants. The teas are good and are really refreshing. Their other dishes are good too and they have a wide variety of different asian cuisines that are also quality dishes. Our waiter was attentive the whole time we were there. On a random note, I though it was interesting that the bathroom played a man teaching Japanese words instead of music!"}
{"text":"Their food is average. The prices are ridiculous and too high for the little bit of food you get. My family ordered food to go, and paid almost $70 for a meal that barely fed all of us (Sushi and fried rice). I won't be returning here. The food is not good enough (to me) to spend that much money on such s tiny portion.  The employees are really nice and helpful. I've been here before and ate inside, and had no problems. But their prices and portion sizes are just not my style."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Eez and have never had anything but amazing meals here. From the miso soup to the potstickers, to hand rolls to stir fry. Absolutely amazing. I am a huge fan of the create your own roll option. Service has always been top notch. On a busy Friday a few months back the wait was an hour and a half. I normally don't wait that long but I was craving sushi. The hostess took our cell phone number so we could wander around Birkdale until our table was ready. We had a bottle of wine at corkscrew and just when we were finishing our last sip we got a call to say our table was ready. Absolutely loved that. Went to a fancy sushi restaurant in NYC last night and it wasn't even in the same category as Eez"}
{"text":"The $27 Chef's Deluxe 15 piece mix had a generous portion of extremely fresh sashimi. The slices were cut thick. The dish left me satisfied. The pretty presentation was a feast for the eyes.   The waiter Connor offered a prompt and friendly service.  It was easy and free to park on the shopping center parking lot."}
{"text":"No taste....is all I have to say about the sushi here....no taste.  How does that happen?  At any rate, I won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"The Food was great . The kitchen was a little slow the day we were there. They gave us a discount for the wait . We would go there again."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-week for dinner and was surprised to see how busy it was!  Our original 30-40 minute wait was reduced since we were willing to fit 5 people at a 4 person table which worked out.  Ordered appetizers and a variety of special sushi rolls.  Generally the rolls were good and fresh.  I expected there to be a bit more ambiance, but it's fairly simple - closer to fast casual than fine dining.  Would recommend for a casual meal (but not necessarily casual prices) but probably not for a date night.  Also, ideal for groups of 3-4 as most tables are smaller and you can't make reservations."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time at Eez but this is my first review. It was overall a good dining experience, I gave it 3 stars because I'm not particularly impressed with the food. I came here with a group of friends. We had a party of 8 and our server handled our group well and the service was good. I had the crab Rangoon dip to start which I absolutely love but I wasn't impressed by my seafood fried rice. I do commend Eez on giving you hefty portions, two or three people could've split that entree. I've had some more flavorful fried rice dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian restaurant, ever! The potstickers are incredible and I get them as an appetizer every time. My favorite entrée is the cashew chicken, it is delicious and full of flavor! The portion is so large that I always end up with leftovers. Everything I have tried here has been excellent - the sweet and sour chicken and Thai orange chicken are also delectable! You can't go wrong. It is pretty much always busy, though, so anticipate a wait."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi restaurant I've been to into Charlotte area.  I love the appetizers and non-sushi dishes as well.  Always great service and atmosphere!  Looking forward to the next trip!"}
{"text":"Well, I love the pad Thai and curry dishes I've had here, but tonight I came with my Vancouver BC sushi snob friend and everything we ordered got rave reviews!  We started with blackened tuna nachos followed by Tasmanian Devil and mad mango-cado rolls!  Yummy with a Conundrum white wine!  Must try this one!"}
{"text":"My second time here and loved it just as much as the first! The food is SO amazing. I always enjoy a sweet potato Rolle since I'm not big into seafood... They didn't have it on the menu, but we're very happy to make it for me. I also highly recommend the stir fry bar bowls.  SO much food!!!! They even have an option where you can go pick your own veggies at the market downstairs. How cool is that?   Only downfall is we went on a Saturday evening and waited nearly 45 minutes.  The waiting area is extremely cramped. And people are walking all over you to get in and out.    I did like the fact they text you when you are up next to be seated.  That way you can go enjoy the Birkdale Village shops!   If you love anything sushi, or Japanese go here!!  You won't be disappointed and I can promise you'll be back."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place. The food is very consistent but so is the wait.  Unfortunately due to the size of their kitchen they cannot fill all tables in a timely manner. You will typically see several tables sit empty for extended periods of time.   This past visit I had the kung pao shrimp.  It was a bit spicy but overall quite delicious!  I would order it again."}
{"text":"Decent Thai fusion restaurant in Birkdale. Nice decor with outdoor seating area. Fun bar area."}
{"text":"Eez is solid and everything is wonderful.  This is the sister restaurant of cowfish.  Eez is more sushi oriented than cowfish is and everything is delicious.  The bathrooms still have japanese rosetta stone.  I ordered a Hop Drop N Roll and the crab dip to start.  The hop drop unfortunately was 2 months old.  The crab dip was on point and came with tempura fried chips.  My sushi combo was wonderful.  The only thing is the price point is a little steep.  Most other sushi restaurants ( even in uptown ) are cheaper than the price point here."}
{"text":"Only sushi place I will eat at. Fish is always fresh. Mark's roll is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Was in Huntersville for the day with Ms. B., and we decided to give Eez Fusion a try for dinner. When we arrived, it was very crowded, but very cordial staff assured us they'd have a table ready in 20-25 minutes; happily, it only took ten. The menu is definitely eclectic, and the wine list is of reasonable size and value. For appetizers, we ordered the filet mignon pinwheels -- thinly sliced beef with jalapeno, spicy sauce, masago, orange, and mango -- which arrived in good time and was fairly tasty. I will say the five pieces for $12 didn't seem the world's best value ever. For dinner, I ordered the \"Moriawase Double Deuce\" for $23, which consisted of a California Roll (average), a spicy tuna rolls (fair at best), and several pieces of fish, all of which were very large, quite fresh, and flavorful. Ms. B. ordered a \"build your own\" roll with inari, basil, asparagus, and masago. I tried hers, not knowing what I might make of it, but I did find it quite fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere here is not particularly Asian -- more a metro-style bar -- and a bit noisy, though not overbearingly so. The value of the food compared to its quality was pretty good, the service was fine, and I have absolutely no complaints. However, nothing stood out enough to give the place superlative marks either. If I'm in the area again, I'd probably give it another go, mainly to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here, AND I AM A BIG FAN! First off, I had NO idea that this place is run by the same people who own Cowfish!!! The menus are eerily similar, but minus the burgers and \"burgerushi.\"  First date with Michelle, and it goes GREAT! I don't know if was my stunning personality, the great food, great service, combination, or just the stars in alignment....but Eez was really a great first date choice!  I broke my Birkdale Village cherry on this choice (Yeay!) and so glad I did! What a wonderful place with MANY choices of so many things to do places to eat establishments to imbibe at!  I SHOULD have written this review right after our date....but better late than never, huh? Anywho.......we ordered a great Mt Veeder wine....nothing better than Napa Cabernet on a first date, right? Our waitress was fantastic, and made some great recommendations, like the Boss and Blackened Tuna Rolls. Both were excellent! This is where I noticed the connection to Cowfish....sushi rolls but not quite ordinary sushi rolls.....We got the Mongolian beef as well. Not quite as good as PF Changs MB but very tasty.  No first date would be complete without flowers, and Michelle was blown away by them. I mean, guys don't bring flowers on first dates anymore? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? Well I DO! So there!  Anyway, a really great vibe here and I can see why it's so popular in this area! When I'm back up this way I will definitely stop back to try their many other dishes!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"They should really say on their website that they DON'T take reservations, and say it on their home page.  I shouldn't have to call and hear a recording that they don't. This yelp site says they do. Whatever."}
{"text":"My expectations for Sushi are quite high and I didn't feel Eez represented that great of Sushi or Value. Birkdale locale is the best part. I really don't like posting a poor review but, walked away feeling gypped."}
{"text":"Incredible service, incredible sushi every.single.time. We use Eez as the standard to which all other LKN sushi joints are judged.   My husband is a very recent convert to the way of the sushi, but he has taken to it with gusto, in part due to the sushi chefs at Eez. He loves to sit at the sushi bar and have the chefs create off-menu rolls just for him.  The chefs are courteous and friendly, and entertain our endless questions and queries.   Oh yeah, and the infused saki is simply insane. Especially fuji apple."}
{"text":"Been here several times, excellent sushi rolls but be prepared to pay premium price. Miss Moffitt roll is excellent. The staff and owner have always been super friendly. The only reason for four stars is the place is crowded and loud especially on the weekends. I recommended a reservation or you can expect to wait to a hour."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. Food was good & fresh. I just can't give it 4 stars. 3.5 stars! Our Big Al's tuna tartare appetizer was delicious! Our sushi rolls were good. I wouldn't go back. Kinda messy inside. I inviting patio. Decent wine list!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for the stir fry bowl. My boyfriend really enjoys the sushi. Service is usually pretty good and on a Friday night the wait is usually long as it is a popular place. They do have a nice bar to have drinks at while you wait. However on a crowded Friday or Saturday night it is usually standing room only and getting to the bar for a drink proves to be a challenge. I recommend trying this place for lunch as they have a small patio outside to sit at and enjoy on a nice day!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and a friend told me about Eez.  Typically not a big sushi fan, but Eez may make me a believer yet! The staff was prompt and attentive and the ambience was great. The Riggs roll and Dave's Filet roll were absolutely amazing. They were both huge...my only recommendation would be to cut them into 10 pieces instead of 8, so each piece could fit into the mouth. This will become a regular stop on my return business trips!"}
{"text":"Terrible atmosphere, may extremely overpriced and they up charge everything, \"oh that will be an extra dollar\". I hated it here! Way too loud, loud noises from the kitchen, way too small of tables, and the tables are uncomfortable close to the other tables so you hear the other guests chatter. I won't ever go to this restaurant again. And would strongly recommend you avoid it too."}
{"text":"This was a second chance visit after a horrible experience over the summer. Today confirmed I will not return to this restaurant. The food is horrible for the prices. I ordered a noodle dish and a rice dish and both were terrible. Noodles were sticky and the chicken was dry. The rice was overcooked and gooey. The manager offered to have a new dish prepared and offered extra sauce. It was so bad neither offer was satisfactory......check please. I will say the service is always great. Just seems they need to reevaluate the kitchen staff and the dishes that are being made. 2 thumbs down to eez fusion. My advice just stick with the drinks and maybe a simple sushi roll."}
{"text":"Very good quality food. The options are pretty limited in this area for sushi restaurants but this place is a must! The servers here are great also. I actually prefer this place to Cowfish in Charlotte. Me and my husband come here a couple times a week and it is consistently good every time."}
{"text":"One of our favorites. I feel like I can eat fairly healthy here. My son loves the kids meal -- they are generous with the veggies and edamame and it has a Rice Krispie with a Swedish fish on top designed like a sushi roll, cute touch. We called in a large order when my in-laws were visiting but somehow the order was lost. They offered my husband and father-in-law a free beer while waited and didn't charge for the food at all. Great service!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in U.S. Extensive menu, personable, friendly staff, and huge portions. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Lake Norman area! This is a well known sushi restaurant to many in the area. No matter what night you choose to go there is always a crowd waiting for a table. Be sure to arrive early and enjoy the bar, they make a great martini! I highly recommend the Mark's roll it's delicious. My new favorite is the two time roll because it is wrapped in thin cucumber instead of rice and the flavoring is a little sweet with tuna. If you really like the chefs to pile it high, choose the Tropical roll, it's huge! All of the chefs are very talented so if you want to build a roll they will make it for you.  It gets really busy here so it's okay to eat at either the bar or the sushi bar, the staff really takes care of you."}
{"text":"The shasimi is good cuts and good quality. Its my go to sushi in Huntersville area. Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"I went here while visiting the North Carolina, Huntersville area and it's awesome! Everything on the menu is delicious. If you are ordering an appetizer you must try the Crab Rangoon Dip! It's delicious! Especially, if you like crab rangoons in a Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Eel Dragon Roll which was so yummy! The eel was fresh... the shrimp was delicious and overall it was a great combination!  If you love sweet wines like myself you MUST try the Makulu Moscato, South Africa. It was fruity and sweet!   The prices overall are okay a little on the expensive side for me but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, best sushi in the area by far.  Very pricey and hostesses are young and worried more about how they look and being on phones than they are about customer service.  Still, the wait staff makes up for their bad behavior for the most part."}
{"text":"Many people like, It doesn't do much for me...average at best, but people flock to this place.  Mgr/owner reached out to me to learn how they could improve..I like that a lot!   Changed rating to 4 stars.   Maybe I'll give Eez another try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here (i love sushi, He doesn't) and have to tell you the place is amazing.  I loved the firecracker roll & seafood fried rice (full of scallops), and the lobster roll.  Simply amazing!  Even my boyfriend wants to come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Eez every time I'm in Charlotte. Big Fan. Love their Sushi, the ambiance and service. Sometimes the wait can be a while but worth it for under 35 minutes. Good for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Bad service followed by dissappointing food.  Our waiter felt it was necessary to explain to us how to read a menu, explained what an \"appetizer\" was...um, duh...I've been eating at restaurants for awhile, I get it.  He started talking about one of their appetizers and compared it to a typical asian restaurant and his exact words were \"the difference is the food here actually tastes good.\" Whatever that meant.  Then he recommended a sushi roll and said \"oh, but it has jalepeno, so its not for everyone.\"  Geez, just say its good and I'll decide if its for me or not.  After explaining how a menu works and insulting my intelligence, our waiter was fine but the mongolian beef was BAD.  Bland, no flavor, nothing special at all.  Thai coconut curry was good and the crab rangoon nachos with seared tuna (which was described by the waiter as \"yeah, it sounds really weird.\") was excellent.  I have to give the place credit though, the ambience is nice and I would give this place another chance if I wasn't just so turned off by the service."}
{"text":"Eez Fusion has some of the best sushi in Charlotte.  It is a bit on the pricey side but the rolls are really big and they use quality ingredients.  They also have a tasty selection of appetizers.  I would personally recommend their crab dip.  It is sensational.    Depending on the day, they have different specials going on, like half-price sake.  To save money, I would also suggest going to their website and signing up for their mailing list.  At the beginning of each month they will send you a coupon for either a Buy One Get One Free Sushi or a Free Appetizer.    If you plan to go here on a Friday or Saturday night I would definitely make reservations.  If you forget, you can put your name and phone number down and walk around Birkdale Village.  They will call you when your table is ready so you don't have to just sit and wait (borrrring)!  During the warmer weather they also have outside seating.  This is particularly nice because the restaurant is located around other cute shops so it's the perfect spot to people watch :)"}
{"text":"Went here about 30 minutes after they opened for dinner service on a Saturday, late afternoon.  Did not eat any food, and was in the location for about 10-15 minutes.  We opted to leave, but here are notes from the visit:  Arrived, greeted reluctantly, and seated.  Menus:  2 of 3 had absolutely no pages inside.  We shared one actual menu.  Atmosphere:  While walking through and while sitting, could not help but observe the old, fishy seafood smell permeating my nostrils.  I suppose if you are a North Carolina die-hard smoker, you'll not know any difference.  Restroom trip:  ladies room, one towel dispenser.  Totally empty (they just re-opened after an afternoon \"siesta,\" it seems, all sleep and no work?)  Came out of ladies room with wet hands and flagged-down the 3rd person who walked past, who had to observe my extended wet hand stance, to explain that I would appreciate some assistance with drying my hands.  Waiting back at table:  Brief small talk at table, so while gone, did have someone stop by, and was in process of getting our waters... several minutes prior.  Hmm, how long does that take?  Notice that smell?  Yeah, well, they do serve \"fresh\" raw fish here... oh, we've been to Japanese-run, sushi-master restaurants that are immaculately clean, and have NO smell!  Hmm.  Sushi dining is an expensive proposition, should we risk spending the $$ to potentially be highly disappointed?  Nobody is even looking at us, nobody is bringing that water anyway... let's fly.  And so we left.  The stars are for location, and since they didn't have a chance to perform any actual food \"service\" I won't deduct more, trying to leave some fairness here.  If I had just spent the bucks, and then was grossed out on top of it, it would be a one-star review."}
{"text":"As someone who works in food service, I understand the post lunch lull and how things can move a little slower. We had kind of a wait for our sushi, but the overpriced sushi and poor quality of the sushi is why I'm rating this place so low.  Do not get me wrong, the service was nice, people were attentive. Just the sushi quality was not up to my expectorations, especially in a place like birkdale. My boyfriend burnt his tongue on the very hot crab Rangoon dip, but that's his fault, nevertheless the waitress did not warn us it was piping hot. It is okay though, it was too greasy for me.  Unfortunately, I will not be back unless I'm with a group and I will know now that the sushi is subpar."}
{"text":"I've truly never had a bad meal here. It's a very busy restaurant most of the time, but the food comes out quickly & as ordered. Only once did the food not come out for a while, and the manager took it upon himself (we did not complain or mention anything) to come over, apologize & comped the food we were waiting for! Overall, the sushi rolls are good, the crab Rangoon dip is delicious, the bento boxes are fantastic, and the pad Thai is... Well, the pad Thai needs a serious revamp, STAT. Until then, just don't order the pad Thai. But everything else is good & this place shouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good food with a nice atmosphere! Awesome variety!! Everything came out tasty!! Tried the tuni nachos, dim sum, pork belly buns, ramen, and bento box!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here for some afternoon sushi and since it was located in Birkdale we figured it had to be great. It wasn't. We ordered just sushi and it took about 40 minutes. It wasn't even busy. The wait was totally not worth it. The sushi was simply ok. Not anything worth me returning for."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed with our meal last night at Eez.  This is the second time we visited and although the first visit was just so-so, we wanted to give them another chance.  My husband ordered the vegetarian curry and although it was spicy, the taste was very bland...almost as if they left a spice or two out.  I ordered a gourmet sushi role and it wasn't flavorful at all.  I've been to Cowfish multiple times and love it so I had high hopes for Eez.  Unfortunately we won't return."}
{"text":"Love Eez!  The food is great! The wait staff is AWESOME! Each time I have been to Eez, I feel the service has always added something to the food.  You can't say that with too many places.   The people at Eez really know their stuff and at the same time they are able to joke with you and really make you relaxed.  I recommend going to Eez with a few people so everyone can get a different roll and then you are able to have a sampler of their menu.  Also, ask them to cut the sushi into smaller bites, their regular sized sushi pieces are ginormous so requesting a smaller cut makes the sushi bite size and more manageable.   So definitely stop by Eez and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The king of sushi and Asian fusion north of exit 18 on I77 :)  The owner Marcus has done a remarkable feat of keeping return customers and adding new ones at the same time. The presentation, ambience, service, variety and crowd make this a must visit spot.   When I have visiting colleagues, friends or family, this is the place I take them to for sushi/asian fusion!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome selection of sushi, signature dishes, fusion, and drink specials.  We had a few sashimi treats, a half priced bottle and entrees...OMG...wake me up now!- EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS  The service was exceptional and the prices were certainly made everything better than ever.  Get there!"}
{"text":"We ordered two sushi rolls and were brought two of the same. The manager tried to convince us that they were different. We asked to see the chef and he never came. The manager didn't even follow up to make sure the rest of our experience went well. We did have a good waiter who made us feel less crazy for assuming we didn't get two different orders. For the price, I definitely won't be back. Maybe their specialty rolls are better... I sure hope so."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, but disappointed they no longer serve the fried cheesecake. My boyfriend and I stopped in just for dessert and they had just changed the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, it's over rated. Service is ok as well. There's not a thing on the menu that I would brag about."}
{"text":"Food here is just okay. Expect long wait times and sushi that isn't cold. The to go food is not near as good as the food in restaurant. It's also really loud. Every time I've gone they have set me and my group by kitchen which is also annoying."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Friday and was very impressed. The staff was really helpful and knowledgeable. Was seated immediately with no wait. The food was just as good. To add, they have both a sushi bar and wine bar.   Our food came out in a reasonable timeframe in which we both ordered the custom bento boxes. We both enjoyed our meals. I had the firecracker roll and she had the blackened tuna roll which both was really good. I also had the blackened mahi mahi taco which was lacking a little bit on flavor so it was just ok to me. She also had the Mongolian beef which was good and they serve you a lot of it too.   Overall it's a great sushi spot to hang out at. And what makes it even better, there's a movie theater literally in walking distance."}
{"text":"I ordered the peach tea, and the mango sushi(can't remember the name). The tea was great, and the sushi was great too. Only complaint was that I found a piece of hair in my sauce (which I didn't eat obvi). Nice clean atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We are traveling monthly from Europe to Huntersville, this is our favorite restaurant: the sushi is to die for and the service is excellent! The best restaurant in the Huntersville area!!"}
{"text":"Went to Eez for the first time and we loved it.  From Hostess to Service and Food it was all Excellent. Will be going back.  We Started with the Crab Rangoon Appetizer which was plenty for 2 and then we both had the Stir Fry. both were excellent.  Looking forward to going back and getting the build your own Sushi."}
{"text":"Now, this place has such a great surrounding. Beautiful environment to be. I recently went there a few days ago with my girlfriend. The service was pretty nice, our waiter was very helpful and patience whenever I had questions, although we went in the morning when it just opened with a few customers. Their sushi size was a little bigger than average but the price range was quite high. I ordered the Firecracker Roll and Tiffany's Roll; my girlfriend ordered their Pad Thai and the total came right at the edge of $50. If you don't like the taste of rice vinegar in your sushi rice, this might be your type of sushi. I couldn't taste much flavor in their sushi. There was little sauce spreading on my sushi even though mine were special rolls and I like mine with a lot of sauce on top. Their shrimp sauce did not taste like it was shrimp sauce, that was very dissatisfying. I would go there again, but maybe not order their sushi."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss with the service primarily. I've been here on a weekday for dinner and gotten great service, and also been on a few weekends and gotten not so great service. It seems like things really fall apart when they are busy, maybe the waitstaff get stretched too thin? But usually on a busy time, our orders are messed up, drinks don't come out or wrong, and we only see our actual server when they take our order and then are delegated to food runners. For their prices, which are a tad steep for the quality and types of Asian food they have, I'd expect a little More attention from my actual waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Eez is delicious! Best Pad thai with shrimp around! The coconut curry soup is awesome and the spring rolls and tacos are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Originally had this place recommended by a friend who travels extensively. Have been here twice and it has always been solid. Great, inventive sushi rolls. Excellent sake collection. Lots of energy. The wait can be long but don't be discouraged- I was there on 4/1/10 and they told me there was a 40 minute drink. They just want you to go to the bar and spend a little. Then 15 minutes later, we got our table."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant (other than Verde and Dressler's, and I'm sure Viva Chicken up here will rock like the Charlotte location) in the Huntersville area.  Service is great.  Casey isn't there any longer (he opened up a drafthouse in Cornelius), but another awesome server is Taylor.  Have bartender Zack make you a Maker's Manhattan, low-ball, large ice cube.  None better.  The rest of the bartenders... eh, it's hit or miss.  The food is great quality.  You get what you pay for, and I have no problem having a slightly higher bill and leaving after a great meal and service at this place."}
{"text":"Although the place is hip and modern, service was great, I think the food was very over priced. while the lobster & crab spring roll and deep fried cheese cake were pretty good. The sushi and rolls were just ok. For the price, I was expecting all the food to be excellent but got OK instead. Will I come back?? probably not. I would rather go to a place less fancy but for great sushi and half the bill, Osaka in Cornelius, perhaps...."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! Great prices and wonderful food! The pork potstickers are delicious!"}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner here twice and can't wait to return.  Excellent quality food and portion size.  I agree with a previous review - that the \"girl hostesses\" were surprisingly useless but our servers have been very good."}
{"text":"We love Eez! We have been here twice and was not disappointed. My husband and j both got the stir fry bowl.  One had chicken with chefs choice of veggies.  The other stir fry bowl we had was scallops and pick your own veggies! The scallops were the small size ones.  For the veggies you have to go to their \"market\" and you pick any veggie you want, put them in a bowl piled high and place it on the chefs counter!  I thought that was a different dining experience and fun!  They have a ton of sushi to choose from, or you can build your own ! Tell them what you want and that is what you will get!"}
{"text":"Eez has the best sushi in town.  They are a little pricey but well worth it... My favorite is The MotherLoad roll!  They always have fresh sashimi  and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I had a HORRIBLE experience at this restaurant yesterday(06/29/2017)!!!! When I walked in, I ordered two sushi rolls at around 2:13 pm. THEY DID NOT GET ME MY FOOD UNTIL 2:54 PM(and that was only after I told the waitress to cancel my order)!!!! I was completely disappointed. At that point l, I told one of the waitresses that I wanted my money back and to not bring out the food(due to the extended wait). They still tried to offer me the food and give me my money back also and I DECLINED THE FOOD, and if you don't believe me I have the refund receipt to prove it..\" Not only that, but a few of the waitress and waiters kept staring at me which made me feel very uncomfortable. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND..."}
{"text":"We love this place for their waiter Casey. He is fantastic.  We will wait for one of his tables to open.  Sushi is great!"}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised how good this sushi actually was!  Hubs and I shared a combo set (the double deuce) and I also had a mango mojito (YUMM-o!)  Just a few negatives: - SOOO loud. we had a big group of - let's say - HAPPY customers seated right behind us.  Why do inebriated people thing they need to shout their conversations??? - the edamame that our friends ordered was undercooked.  they were able to get the item off the bill, but it took about 100 years, because... - the server seemed to disappear for LONG periods.  So overall...good food.  okay atmosphere.  subpar service."}
{"text":"Pretty happy with the make your own sushi concept! Extensive menu, loads of options.  Poke tuna appetizer was really good- nice level of spice!  I made my own sushi.  The fish quality was pretty good.  The roll size was fairly big."}
{"text":"I grew up in Huntersville, and this is easily the best sushi joint in the area.  Pros: - large space that is partitioned into numerous rooms and outdoor seating areas so that they can host a large number of guests without feeling crowded - outdoor heated seating is nice for cooler evenings - solid sashimi, nigiri options, with customizable sushi rolls. I had the tropical storm roll last that has salmon, tuna, yellowtail, eel sauce and crab, with a large portion size. - decent beer selection, with Japanese beers such as Sapporo on tap  Cons - relatively high price for individual rolls. You will get one large speciality roll for $15-20, which is enough to fill your appetite, but leaves you with only one kind of roll - many of the rolls have cream cheese, jalapeños, or other American twists, making it a less authentic joint  Overall, decent sushi spot, with a good atmosphere but relatively high price point and a somewhat Americanized style."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have found in the Huntersville area. I try a different roll every time I go and have never been disappointed. You also need to try the Spicy Coconut Soup."}
{"text":"Husband and I went there for our anniversary... delicious.  I'm a fan of the non-fish sushi items, and they have an enormous selection of both.  Also, they have several pages of non-sushi items, which makes it a great place to get together with sushi lovers and sushi haters. :)  We'll be back, most definitely."}
{"text":"Food was great!!   Lots of good Sushi.   Highly recommend the Rainbow, California and Mad Mangocado Rolls"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed our meals at EEZ Fusion. We had sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, spicy chicken and a couple of kids meals. The food was well prepared and the service excellent. Portions were so large my wife and daughter had another full meal from the leftovers. Service and wait staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.  Before opening sister restaurant, The Cowfish (in Southpark), I would have said it's the BEST place in Charlotte for sushi. Now you have a tie!  Trendy place with a vast menu that can be overwhelming. Ask your server about specials, or for help choosing a sushi roll that's right for you.  Great lunch sushi specials!  Gorgeous presentation, nothing will be out of place on your culinary masterpiece. The sushi is fresh, flavorful, and beautiful. This is the BEST place to get sashimi or rolls with raw fish.  Ready for dessert? YOU MUST TRY THE CREME BRULEE--amazing fusion and perfect balance of orange and ginger, don't be surprised if you catch yourself licking the bowl (I do, EVERYtime). The chef always knows it was me :)"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and my boyfriend and I ventured out to eez. It was truly the BEST choice. We ordered the Crab Rangoon Dip (our 2nd time!) and I'm not kidding it's so big I could've just eaten it as an entre. Creamy and full of crab! Next we were on to sushi. We ordered a double salmon roll, a garlic tuna roll, a mango tuna roll, and a surfing roll (the last 2 names I couldn't remember). They were incredible. High quality fish with plenty of dipping sauce. I had to stop myself from becoming a sushi balloon.  There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived, but they will text you on your phone once the table is ready. Super convenient so that you can hang around Birkdale :)  Eez is a fantastic special occasion dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"eeZ was a pleasant surprise for me while staying in Huntersville. Located in Birkdale Village, plenty of parking and easy location to drive to.  The sushi and sashimi were very fresh and prepared in good presentation. Sitting at the bar may have brought faster service, good time length between check ins without being too disruptive.   With service and food quality I would definitely rate it 4. Will definitely return next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Went with 5 people. Had a wonderful lunch. 2 bento boxes, one sushi (firecracker) and two build your own bowls. Everything was fresh and delish. Also we had a mix up on the table so we received a free crab Rangoon dip. Great customer service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and decided to give it a try with my husband since we don't know any good places for sushi. When I first saw the place, I thought to myself, wow this place is tiny and there's no one here. But right before entering the place, two waitresses opened the door for us and was very welcoming. We decided to sit outside since it's a nice day out. The waitress took us around to the other side of the restaurant and at that time I realized that this place is actual huge and there were people enjoying their lunch! We ordered the double duces combo sushi and calamari. We didn't have to wait too long for our order and our waitress she was very nice. She came by a few times asking us if everything is alright and if we needed anything. Sure the prices for this place is a little expensive but their sushi are bigger than most places and the surrounding is very welcoming and plus great service! Definitely coming back here again and again :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food today at EZ Fusion. Atmosphere on the porch was wonderful. When we were suddenly hit with a downpour the waitstaff was on it right away rolling down screened shades on the patio which blocked the rain. When the storm blew over, they were back on it rolling the shades up. Great time, great food, great service. Always my favorite restaurant in Birkdale and located just across the street from the movie theater."}
{"text":"We used to dine here regularly, we would have always given 5 stars...and then right around March they changed their menu, they used to have  more items on the menu, BEST SALMON SANDWICH EVER...Dont try & order it now; it's no longer on the menu...feel like the grade of quality has fallen a bit, used to love tuna nachos, they are now made w/sub-par tuna, they will charge you $3 extra for sashimi grade now...the rest of the food is still good, just not outstanding, crisp, fresh...like it used to be, almost feels \"franchized\" now...we have been 4x's  since the menu change...getting sushi rolls(which seem to be the same)- is the only food we will now order, what a shame"}
{"text":"Spend $41 on a to go order for my wife and I. Got home, no chopsticks, no soy sauce, no fortune cookie. Not that it's the end of the world but you would expect they would double check for those items. Called the manager and his response was \"sorry about that\".  I expect exceptional service out of an upscale establishment like this and I didn't think that response was sincere. In my opinion the response should have been \"sorry about that, let me get your mailing address and ill send you a gift card\". Just kind of sucks eating plain sushi with a fork.  I have enjoyed exceptional service there when dining in. Just a little disappointed given the price for 3 rolls."}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi and more.  Staff was attentive. Food was great and even rcvd a coupon for next time.  A favorite next time I go to NC."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The wok is good because you can pick your protein, veggies, sauce and if you want a carb (rice, noodle, etc). They have a gigantic selection of rolls. The fish is fresh. The prices aren't too high. Dessert is blah."}
{"text":"Greatest ramen I have found in Charlotte yet!  Great, friendly, quick service!  Thank you so much!!! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! They have really upped their game since the last time I was there about 2 years ago. Service was good and the bento box was delicious! The sushi is by far the best in the area."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday around 2....it was busy, most customers were sitting outside. It has a nice atmosphere and great outdoor seating. Our food was delicious!! The service is lacking which is why I gave it 3 stars. It took a while to have our order taken and the wait staff isn't super friendly...although they had plenty to chat about amongst themselves. I expected much better service since the place is a little pricey. We will definitely give it another try, the food really is wonderful and beautifully prepared."}
{"text":"I have been to Eez Fusion several times before so I knew when going on a Saturday evening it would crowded.  Also, since the sun was out today and people were getting Spring fever I knew it would be extra crowded.  Nevertheless, we went anyway and were prepared to have to wait.  They told us it would be a 15 min wait and it was just about 15 min before our table was ready.  The only negative I can say about our experience this evening was the location of our table.  It was just my husband and I but we were seated a table right in the middle of the main walk way (meaning where everyone has to walk to get to their tables - customers, staff) and we were next to the entrance to the kitchen and immediately next to the \"butlers pantry\" where the staff adds up checks and sort of congregate.  So, we constantly had traffic all around us.  It looked like this particular table was just added at last minute just to have more seating.  If I am ever seated here again I will ask for another table.  Our server, Allie, was great! Prompt, patient, answered our questions, gave suggestions, appeared to be happy with her job.  She checked on us a decent amount of times without being annoying (I hate when servers keep coming by every 5 min to ask \"is everything ok?\").  She smiled and gave good eye contact.  5 stars for her.  The food was yummy, love the crab Rangoon dip (of course!).  Our sushi rolls were delicious.  Hubby got the firecracker roll and I honestly cannot remember what I got but it was good! We ordered 2 Bento boxes to go for our 2 teens we left at home.  Overall, the service is consistently great, the food is always delish but I wish they would find a larger space for this restaurant.  It felt crammed tonight."}
{"text":"Lunch is an interesting experience...you get to see how dirty condiments are...like soy sauce....covered in food and finger prints...this second visit...the waiter with the tatoo arms felt more value in talking with folks at the bar than giving me the check.  But the food is good and one of only a few places in the cornburbs for sushi.  So I had to suffer through it while I was there....just as I did for Enso, but both are off my list for a while...plenty of places in the city for sushi...someone somewhere wants to run a sushi place like it is 5 star...haven't found it yet, but I\"m sure it is out there.  The place is ALWAYS hopping on the weekends and outdoor seating is great during the warmer month.  Have I always had bad service...no...have I always had good food.......absolutely."}
{"text":"We were walking through the neighborhood when we passed by Eez. What a genius feeling I had to decide to have lunch here.  The atmosphere is very laid back, clean but very nice interior. Very friendly staff and the food was awesome.  We had Edamame as an appetizer and I had teriyaki salmon for lunch. That topped off with a nice cup of tea at the end made my day.  This is definitely a place to stop by to enjoy lunch or dinner alone or with friends.  We'll definitely come back here soon :-)"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to eat sushi! You defiently need to make a reservation though (thank goodness I did). We had the Lava Roll... Divine!!! And the lettuce wraps (seriously I need the recipe, like now!)"}
{"text":"The sushi is good. The place seems busy everytime I come. The drinks could be stronger. Its a nice sushi  place to eat at in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Food is good but poor service and cramped seating make eating at this restaurant an ordeal most of the time."}
{"text":"We ordered take out Friday 9/8 with food  allergy discrepancies, we noticed a accidental ingredient contamination upon returning home, i returned to the restaurant and spoke to the manager about the mix up! He took the matter very seriously and went above and beyond to correct our order and to meet out needs.  A+ customer service!"}
{"text":"I love Eez! One of my favorites in Huntersville and I've never had a bad meal here.  Food: 5/5. ALWAYS fresh and delicious. I always get the stir fry bar, choosing my own veggies, rice noodles, and teriyaki sauce. Food always comes out quickly, hot, and delicious. So good!  Atmosphere: 4/5. Always noisy and busy. This attests to the popularity of the restaurant but hard to hear your company sometimes.  Service: 4/5. Usually great service with very attentive wait staff.  Overall: 5/5 for delicious, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here.  However, the first time I came was over a working lunch and what should of taken maybe an hour took a little over 2 hours because of some issue with the cooks getting too many orders of sushi at once.  Had to scarf down the food and leave.  Some of my colleagues had to leave early because they had meetings.  Our waiter didn't tell us the issue, had another waitress apologize and explain the situation.  We had asked for the manager but he never came around.  Excellent food, awful service."}
{"text":"I loved Eez, but I have never been more disappointed in a restaurant than my last visit. Our waitress treated us like third class citizens, causing us to completely miss our movie, nearly forgetting to give my sister her to-go box and only refilling our drinks twice in the two hours we were there (not by choice). I understand we are college students and carry that stigma, but I have no problem paying for good food and good service.  Honestly, I am not sure what happened to Eez."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Eez Fusion and it will not be our last.   Fabulous vegan and gluten-free choices. I ordered the Stir Fry Bar and my husband ordered the bento box.  Both were wonderful!!!   Ian, one of the managers, came over and asked if we would like an appetizer recommendation - Sure, why not?  My only request was no coconut, as I am allergic. He brought us the Blackend Ahi Tuna Nachos.  Great recommendation, they were delicious!!!!   Right before our meal was delivered, our waiter came out to let me know that the Yellow Curry sauce I ordered in my Stir Fry contained coconut, according to the chef.  This is impressive!!!  The chef remembered from my conversation with the manager that I am allergic to coconut, for this reason alone, we will be back.   The menu is long and daunting, but just take your time - the perfect choice will come to you."}
{"text":"The food was ok, even though the pricing was a little high for the amount of food that was given to you. The thing that made me give a three star review is that it was a week night when we went not very busy, we were told the wait would be around 15-20 minutes. We did not get seated until almost an hour after we had put our name on the list. If you have time to wait and the money to spend then this is the place."}
{"text":"Went to EeZ for my wife's birthday. She wanted Sushi.  Almost all the specialty rolls were cooked or included cream cheese.  We ordered Nigiri and several rolls. I was disappointed in the quality of the fish.  Salmon was a little mushy and fishy.  Yellowtail was ok, but not great. The portion sizes were large and so were the prices.  It looked like some other tables were enjoying entrees that might be a better choice than the sushi. The manager did come by at the end of the meal to ask about our experience.  He seemed interested in our feedback and discounted our meal based on the feedback we gave him.  The service and atmosphere were good.  I might come back and try something besides sushi."}
{"text":"Overall this is a nice place.  Most of my friends like to go here regularly. Sushi is pretty good, but can be pricey for some of their rolls. You tend to find more older people here (cougars pregaming before they hit the town, older professional men with no game, etc). I definitely enjoy half priced wine bottles on Wednesday nights....that's a real busy day there. Their Rangoon Crab Dip is awesome. Overall, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Eez for 9 years. The service is always great, the food has been consistent.  The sushi boasts high grade fish and if you are lucky enough to make it on a Thursday ask for the giant sea urchin - it is mind blowing.  One thing - please bring back the creamy style Pad Thai - it was the best ever!"}
{"text":"Sushi lunch special: 8pc Spider roll and Thai Cucumbers. This is my choice, but there are a few other choices of rolls and apps. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could. My wife, daughter and I go to EEZ every Saturday for the past 6 months. Love it, Love it, service food excellent. The environment is great, great patio. The food is healthy, I am on a diet and eat healthy Sushi, they know what to substitute to make it healthier. Professional Service. Good wine selection, and please try their Martini selection."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP!! There is a GOD! The God of sushi and fusion Asian located in Birkdale Village. You will not go wrong here and the service was absolutely spectacular. Create your own stir-fry, eat some sushi, or have some fusion food. Sit back and enjoy. That is what you will love about this place. Ask to see their entire collection of assorted teas. My Chai came in a tall glass mug with the tea placed strategically in the mug by wooden holders and fine tea strainer. Amazing.   It's hard to believe we spend so much on raw food... but this place was worth it. Not one complaint."}
{"text":"Another excellent restaurant from the owners of Cow Fish in South Charlotte.  Eez is a fusion of Thai food and Sushi but they also have a nice selection of tacos.  I typically get the Bento box which includes one taco (fish, beef, or chicken) and one sushi roll of your choice.  I've had a few of the different taco options now, the blackened Mahi Mahi is really good as is the Thai Curry Chicken.  I'm not a huge connoisseur of sushi but I have come to really appreciate it.  The Mark's roll is really good by itself but the added kick of Sriracha puts it over the edge for me.  Next time I think I'm going to try and Firecracker roll though, a college I was dining with ordered it and it looked really good as well.  I also tried some of the Pad Thai my wife ordered and it was solid as well.  Overall excellent restaurant and I'm really glad it's in the neighborhood.  The hike down to Cow Fish can be daunting (but also worth it).    The space is much bigger than I initially thought.  There are two main dining areas with quite a bit of seating.  I've never had to wait long for a table which has been nice.  I think the longest I've had to wait is 15 minutes.  With all of the shops at Birkdale nearby time flies by.  Don't forget to grab a fortune cookie on the way out.  It's easy to forget!"}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star review if it wasn't for the hostess! Came in around 3-4ish. Was immediately sat outside by a blonde waitress wearing a blue blouse. The sun was in our face so we asked to move so that we could eat comfortably. She then told us that there are no other seats open. Mind you, there is an open table next to us, two unbussed tables in the patio, 75% of the bar was empty--tell me how all the seats are taken? I asked if we could sit at the bar and she allowed us to.   After that, we were served by an amazing bartender named allison! She was amazing. 5 stars for her! Thank you allison for giving such great customer service!! (:  The food was pricy, but it was good. Definite get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Eez.    I love the sushi. I love the cooked dishes. I love the appetizers. I love the drinks. I love the location. I love...Eez!  I always ask for my sushi rolls in more cuts, so I can enjoy every piece in one bite.  Eez offers 8 cuts as a norm.  I ask for 10 but sometimes they can only do 9 if there is too much inside the roll.  Maybe ask for your next roll in 9 or 10 slices, which I think is perfect!  It also makes me feel like I'm getting a little more.  I love the Marks roll, Rigs R&R, Miss Moffits & the Garlic Tuna roll.  The pad thai is so yummy and a huge portion (3 meals for me).  For an appetizer, the crab rangoon dip is my top pick but the Tuna Nachos is great too.  I love sitting in the front room, the patio on the front corner or at the sushi bar.  The back room tends to get really really loud, so it is difficult for conversation.  I always feel like people are yelling.  Either way, enjoy a beverage at the bar while you wait and transition right over to one of my favorite spots in Lake Norman.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars but they took the Thai Red Curry Muscles off of the menu and those were some of the best muscles I've had nationwide!  Now the only thing that would bring me back is the Walu Pinwheels."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is really friendly and attentive, their sushi is so yummy, and there is a ton of inside and outside seating. They are a bit pricy but cheep food ain't good and good food ain't cheep."}
{"text":"Great lunch deals and super fresh rolls. Apparently it's a fun spot weekend nights, as well. Regardless, your sushi fix will be handled...I'm talking Olivia Pope \"handled.\""}
{"text":"Definitely a fusion selection with a sporty feel with modernized culinary options.  For me, it falls nowhere in Charlotte's Top 5 Sushi options, nor does it sister-store Cowfish.  I know, blasphemy in Charlotte but hey, this is my review and just one man's opinion.  We lived in Huntersville at one time and visited a couple times and tried various dishes.  We recently visited for a family birthday event.  From the service and cleanliness aspect, Eez ranks high.  They are extremely friendly and host an excellent staff.  They also offer a large menu with all sorts of options.  It's excellent for events and family options because it really offers something for everyone.  On the other hand, each option is subpar to what you can get elsewhere.  The sushi is highly touted in the area but is full of rice and twice the money than other great sushi.  The Pad Thai features thicker noodles and has less of a true Thai taste to it, the drink menu is fairly basic, and many other options just leave much to be desired.  Some of the apps are however fantastic such as their take on Crab Rangoon.  They are in chip and dip form and are full of flavor.  Desserts offer some great options as well.  For my money though, it's far too overprice to justify the wait.  I would rather have better sushi for market pricing."}
{"text":"Located in Birkdale Village in Huntersville, eeZ Fusion & Sushi has some great Asian dishes, but goes a step further by implementing the use of \"non-traditional\" fresh meats and vegetables on its specialty rolls. To top it off, eeZ offers an array of fresh steaks and seafood dishes. Each dish, including all sushi items, is fully customizable at the guest's request. The staff is also very accommodating and knowledgeable about the dishes."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant in the area.  The Scorcher roll is AMAZING!!  Great atmosphere, excellent food and good service.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis.  Is it a sports bar, irish bar, sushi bar, grill, chinese, thai or japanese?  After staring at the menu for a long long time, I finally decided on the sushi sashimi combo. It was boring and mediocre. I expected more inventive, special, innovative because it was after all a 'fusion' restaurant.    I did notice something very strange. There was at least, 6-8 tables on their first date.  I guess, if you don;t know what the other person eats, this place would  be a safe bet, cos you are sure to find something."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The staff was awesome!!! My wife and I had planned on going to another spot for dinner but because of situations we found ourselves on a different side of town. That being said we finally ended up in the Birkdale area and did a Yelp search. After great reviews and price point we decided on Eez Fusion and it was an excellent choice. Our server Taylor was great. The location and feel of Eez was inviting and welcoming. The coconut curry soup was fantastic.  We also enjoyed the pot stickers,  a bento box, and mad mango sushi.  The final exceptional touch was the personal attention given to us by the general manager Mike to make sure our first visit was unforgettable. Kudos to all the staff and the culinary team who prepared our meal."}
{"text":"Recently ate here when I was home in Charlotte for a visit. We went on a Friday, so the wait was long (45 minutes), but the pagers have a far enough radius that we were able to walk around the shops while we waited for our table. Once we were seated and had menus, I noticed that the menu had a lot of the same sushi rolls as The Cowfish over by Southpark. I asked our waiter if the restaurants were connected, and when he confirmed they were I got excited. I LOVE The Cowfish.   My friend and I shared an order of edamame, we each ordered one roll and a glass of wine, and I left stuffed! The rolls are expensive, but they're huge. I ordered the firecracker roll:  Firecracker Roll:  Shrimp tempura and kani roll coated with tempura flakes, topped with fresh yellowtail and salmon. Finished with spicy cream sauce, tobiko and scallions. Served with ponzu dipping sauce  It was AWESOME! Not as spicy as I was hoping for, but the presentation was beautiful and the fish tasted so fresh.   Will definitely visit again on a future trip back to CLT."}
{"text":"Since I used to work in Huntersville, I've been to Eez many a time. Sometimes for dinner, other times for lunch - typically during the weekdays. And for many of those times I encountered a 3-4 star experience; the sushi was solid, the service was fine. Frankly, it holds a bit of a monopoly in the sushi arena in Huntersville. However, over the weekend hubs and I grabbed some lunch on a (seemingly) casual Sunday afternoon. Oh my oh my how the experience differed...  We were seated promptly, which was great considering the restaurant was pretty full. I noticed immediately how many little (2-4 yr. old) kids there were eating throughout the restaurant. And throwing things. And screaming. Now, before you call me a kid hater, hold off. I like kids. I just don't think an expensive sushi & asian fusion place is the *best* place to bring a slew of fussy toddlers.  Anyway, beyond the kid factor every.single.dish (and glassware) put in front of me was some sort of dirty. Crusty wasabi, soy sauce, etc. I had to ask for fresh plates and chopsticks twice and one particular time the manager (I assume the manager as he wasn't a server, busser or bartender) rolled his eyes at me. WOW. Nice. I just want a clean plate, please.  So, let me stop the haterade and quickly say the sushi was fine. The Tropical Storm roll was delicious, albeit $2 more than it is at Cowfish. The spicy hamachi was decent, but I've had better. The calamari is also quite tasty - lightly breaded with a nice crispity crunch.   Overall, I'll echo Michael E - the food is pretty tasty (albeit overpriced) but the service really, and I mean really, irked me this last go around. We'll call it three 4-star experiences and one, 2-star experience."}
{"text":"Family favorite. In fact this place is very kid friendly   They have the cutest Benito boxes for kids meals. Including fresh fruit and a little sweet bite  Consistently good food   Always fresh and nicely presented  They get fish flown in for them The best calamari I've had Huge menu and lots of choices  You can even pick out your own veggies for your stir fry from the veggie bar if you want  Very attentive service and eager to please  I like the manager stopping to check on us.  Inside gets loud so hearing can get hard Nice patio seating. My favorite in good weather  One of our family's favorite restaurants  Decent prices too"}
{"text":"You pay for what u get. A constant changing of sushi options and awesome selections for anyone. The sushi is really good and fresh. This is the only sushi spot in Charlotte I have found that I trust everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times. Food has been delicious every time. No exceptions! My favorite appetizers are the crab Rangoon dip or the avocado and tuna tini. I have had many of the main course dishes as well. My favorites have been fried rice, pointless roll (noticed it wasn't on the menu my last visit.) and the birkdale roll."}
{"text":"Eez is one of my wife's favorite date night spots. Great sushi, appetizers and drinks. Crab Rangoon is delicious and lettuce wraps are always a fan favorite. The spicy crunchy roll and California roll are my two favorites! An added bonus, is the kids meal. It is huge and you get some really great adult food, in a bento style box. The kids dessert is a Rice Krispy treat, shaped like a sushi roll, topped with a Swedish fish candy."}
{"text":"Three words. Two Time Roll. I'm pretty sure this is the only roll on the menu wrapped in cucumber. It's AMAZING. Side of seaweed salad and some edamame with some siracha salt. Sold. Came a little early around 5 on a week night. Great service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of the sushi was great 5 stars on that. The negative would be that our table was extremly sticky and service was alright. Was quick with my beers but my wifes water wasent taken care of. The food was good enough for me to give it another go but hopefully theyll up the cleanliness and customer service"}
{"text":"Stay away.  This place is neither good nor cheap.  $6 for a miso soup?  No lunch menu?  The sushis are subpar.  Disappointed but not surprised considering the extensive menu ranging from cheap Chinese dishes to sashimi platters.  Rarely a good sign.  On the other hand, kung-fu noodles, one block away, is a much better of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here and Cowfish many times, and multiple times I've been told that Eez is the better location of the two (mainly because they get there first pick of fish of the truck when it comes into town) - but its hard to choose..  My last few experiences I've had I had a waiter named Casey, who was great a giving reviews of food he thought was good.  An app that he suggested and we tried was the Blanked Tuna Nachos, they were delicious! The Bento boxes are nice to try a mixture of food.  Can't wait to come back and try something new. =)"}
{"text":"Eez is always a hit.  The food is always delicious, service is gracious and both are consistent.  I love their sushi, but every dish I've had there has been delicious in its own right.  This restaurant is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch special (11am-4pm). They had a good selection of food for a lunch menu. And the prices were good for the amount of food you got.  The rolls in general did look pretty pricey.. Maybe next time i'll try it out!  The decor of the restaurant is well thought of and very modern. The lime green walls remind me of wasabi haha"}
{"text":"We've been to Eez many times.  They updated their menu recently to offer some new variety.   Their shrimp/pork wontons are fabulous.  Their sushi is expensive, but very good, such as my favorite, The Impersonator ($18).  The stir fry bar is reasonably priced and very good, and my hubby loves their steak and Mahi tacos.  Their thai fried rice is outstanding.  While they changed the drink menu over a year ago, I can usually still get my favorite, the cocotini, sort of like a martini version of a pina colada. Their martinis are more expensive than I usually pay, however ($12).  Service is always quick and efficient.  This is a great place to come if you want to catch a movie afterwards, since you'll always be in and out very fast.  We return often because Eez is close and convenient, and their food is delicious.  Just be prepared for a bit of a sticker shock when you get the bill."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat raw fish and stick to the crab-based items but couldn't help myself! Everything that we ordered was absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"anything you eat here is great!!!!!! best restaurant in huntersville!!"}
{"text":"Slow service even to place an order (10 min before they asked). Once order was placed food came out quickly. Good sushi and will come back again."}
{"text":"This spot has become one of my all time favs in the area.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the food...everything I have tried has been outstanding!  From the sushi to the specialty dishes, and the appetizers and dessert are just all amazing.  You can't go wrong with what you order.  The red curry noodle dish is my fav...make sure you add shrimp.  And that banana foster dessert is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Delicious stir fry bar! I loved eating here because they offered fabulous vegetable choices. The Thai peanut sauce was very good as were the soba noodles.  The portions are large!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of Asian food, pretty good Pad Thai and Red Curry Noodles. The sushi is decent and seems \"fancy\" with creative mixes, but is over priced and pretty ordinary in my opinion. For some reason, I always leave thinking I paid a lot of money for not that much food.  A good option: I would pay a visit if I'm in the area or watching a movie that night, but would not go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Years ago, Eez was (admitantly) my first experience with sushi. Since the opening of Cowfish, I find myself at Cowfish more than Eez but still like to visit Eez when me (and the people I'm with) are in the mood for just sushi.   Is this place kinda expensive? Yeah. But it's good and always fresh. The most affordable option is the create-your-own-sushi roll. The last time I went, I had shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber. Other than the ABUNDANCE of sesame seeds (which I didn't order), it was delicious. I have always been pleased and will keep coming back. Next time, I will specifically say \"hold the sesame seeds\""}
{"text":"I believe that cowfish owners also own this place as well, but it is not the same at all. The food was good but not on Cowfish level good .  I order the noodles chef style with shrimp . The noodles to me were flavorful,  but oversaturated with sauce. I don't like when a sauce takes away from the rich texture of the noodles.   They use to have a lunch menu but now it is a all day menu. I believe you have to eat sushi here to truly enjoy the experience. I haven't been in a couple years and I don't really have a big rush to get back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my husband for a quick sushi roll and beer at the bar. Great service! They were busy and we still sat right down, got our drinks, sushi and check in the time we needed to get out and to the movies. The bartender was so nice. I asked for extra wasabi and love that I didn't have to ask twice or explain. Some sushi places are confused by that oddly enough. Everything was fresh and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Big Eez fans at our house.  Is it the best Sushi ever?  No. but its consistently good with a nice selection of Nigiri, rolls, etc...  Even a make your own choice.  It is a little pricey as other reviewers have noted and that may be the one thing keeping this review at 4 stars.  The rest of the menu is solid and changes up relatively frequently to keep things interesting.  Love the design your own noodle bowls with your choice of noodles, sauce, veggies, proteins.  A new lunchtime offering of fish tacos are well done and frigging huge.  Two giant tacos filled with crispy fish, napa cabbage and finished with a delicious cilantro sriracha cream sauce.  Plan to share with a friend.  Lastly, my wife would not forgive me if I didn't mention the Thai Cucumber appetizer.  Sweet, tangy, yummy heat.  We bring them home to use as sides at least 2x week."}
{"text":"Great sushi great crab Rangoon dip! Great staff as well! First impressions are big! Can't wait to go back! Maybe Tonight!"}
{"text":"Location location location... that's the primary thing this restaurant has going for it. Located in the heart of Birkdale Village, it's a perfect place to grab a drink, sushi roll or hot meal while shopping or catching a flick. They have a small dining area in the front, an enclosed patio, a smaller covered patio, then a larger dining area in the back (or side in their case).  The sushi has always been fresh. We like to build our own rolls. Their rolls are good. They're not extra special in my opinion, (hence why we build our own), and they're pricy. Unlike the majority of sushi restaurants in the area, they don't have any kind of special pricing promos (no happy hour, no discount days.) While that's not standard in most restaurants, we've come to expect it in sushi restaurants.  Now, they have one dish I really love. Their crab Rangoon! It's these large wonton chips on a platter, and rather than the filling in the wontons, the cheesy filling is in a ramekin on the side to dip in. The chips are drizzled with a chili glaze and it's devine.  We always need to ask for more chips than they give us, and we ask for extra chili Thai glaze on the side for dipping. It's A special dish! Give it a shot!  Expensive no sushi specials"}
{"text":"The sushi is good, I like the service! It is family friendly which I love! Definitely my favorite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"It was amazinggggg! I had to fix my first review because I'm soo happy that I gave Eez Fusion another shot. It was great that Eez Fushion had reached out to me and I greatly appreciate it. It shows that they really care about their customers.   I order a veggie roll and added in tempura flakes. I was told that the tempura flakes had was fried in the same fryer it is used to fry seafood. When I said I had an allergy they took it seriously. When I mean seriously, I had the waitress ask me and then two managers came to ask me as well. My sushi was alright, but the sushi wasn't what that mattered for me that night. It was my meal. I had the Chicken Cashew, it was the bombb! I don't normally like onions but the way they caramelized it... was so good! I will be coming back for that dish! Yumm.   My boyfriend loved his sushi and he had the red curry chicken? I can't recall the name, but he said it reminded him of a dish his parents make. You know that's a good sign!   I also ordered a mix drink, I believe it was the tini wennie tiny martini, I LOVE the name. haha The drink was alright... A lot of people enjoy the taste of lime or lemon in their drink. I guess it wasn't for me. I will try different drinks next time.  Overall I had a great time. My boyfriend said he felt like royalty. The customer service was amazing and so so friendly! Thank you so much for reaching out to me and for the dinner. I will brag to everyone how awesome Eez Fushion was. Great place for parties too =)"}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this 5 stars - stylish, great service and top notch master sushi chefs that I certainly never expected to find in a suburb of Charlotte. Great selection of rolls. The one meal I had, their deluxe sashimi assortment plus a spicy tuna roll - was simply superb. The fish was pristinely fresh, and the spicy roll wasn't ' the usual chopped tuna with chili sauce (NTTAWWT - its a favorite) but whole pieces of tuna with a variety of other ingredients - not sure where the heat came from, but it was balanced and great.   Based on one visit they're up there with the places I consider shrines of sushi - Nobu, Ebisu, Kaz in DC. If it's the same after a couple more times I'd give them 5 stars. Either way, a must visit if you're in the area. and want sushi, with food and an experience that would probably draw crowds in NY or SF."}
{"text":"Ok, we usually go to Sushi on the Lake but I think they may have changed hands, well they were closed on the 4th so we decided to try Eez. The waitress was super sweet and the manager even came over to make sure we had a good meal. I asked about their pad Thai and I was asked if I woudllike to try it. Of course I said no, but that was sup sweet. the sushi was super good and will be back to try some other items. The Bento box was more than enough for any one person to eat. I always thing restaurants in outdoor malls like Birkdale will be soso but I am happy to report this one is a winner"}
{"text":"When a restaurant has over 200 reviews with 4 stars, you'd have high expectations. I was pretty excited for this place given its fame and the fact that its hard to just casually walk in without a reservation. On Friday night I was around Birkdale village and craving sushi, so I decided to give it a shot. I had to wait at least 40 minutes but it was fine..understand that it was a rush hour.  Their menu is giant. A lot of options. We ordered Fried calamari to start off. Not gonna lie, it was only 3 minutes after we ordered and calamari was cold. Big mistake! We also ordered the Two Time Roll. I'm giving 1 star for that. Food was meh, bland and no quality. Not sure if I think the roll was just like buffet quality. I thought $20 for the roll should have been better than this. I was very disappointed for the price and portion here.   Service = meh Price = not really reasonable maybe it depends on what you order.  Not sure if I would go back but if you are in the area you should go check this place out (The only sushi place around)"}
{"text":"Can I tell you that this is my favorite place for sushi? If you get the crab rangoon dip you WILL fall in love with it. It's a party for the palate. Everything I have ever ordered from eeZ Fusion has been delicious and the drinks are good as well. Always great customer service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great sushi at Eez. Nigiri is always fresh and rolls are great. Top of my list when I am in Birkdale area."}
{"text":"Great everything!   The service is great.   Always have good recommendations.   Food is the best Sushi in NC."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience at this place. They have a great variety on their menu and they are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Finally made it into Eez Fushion.  The place was packed as usual on a weekend evening.  We made our way to the sushi bar.  This was quite an experience as we were able to see the most beautifully prepared sushi dishes on their way out to waiting customers.  Just looking at the sushi made me want to sample ALL of it, particularly the seaweed served in a martini glass.  I thought I ordered a spicy crab roll but it was not spicy and it did not taste much like crab.  Mind you, this was to be a real crab dish, vs. the sushi made with white fish with \"crab taste\".  However, I ate the roll and it was good with the Apple Saki.  At one point, I forgot I was eating crab and thought I was eating shrimp.  I look forward to returning for the create-your-own combo stir-fry meals where you do your own prep."}
{"text":"Stupid girl hostesses looking at phones and tablets. Hands full as I was walking out and they looked up without even thinking of opening door. Guess they think they are super models and don't actually work there.  For the money you pay.... !!! On other hand our to go order server was fantastic why does this restaurant have these dopey hostesses who do nothing  and I mean notjimg!!  ."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. Waiter was attentive and apologized about our appetizer coming out a little late. Manager also came over and was very nice. Food was delicious and very good portions. The Szechuan chicken was good i got the normal one not the spicy kind. Mark's roll was a little spicy with the Siracha but so delicious."}
{"text":"Had to update after going there for lunch today. My previous review focused on the sushi menu only. When we went for lunch today we decided to try the non-sushi menu. I went with the Mongolian Beef ($11) which was really, REALLY good. The beef was tender and the variety of veggies that came with it were good. It was almost like a fajita with soft, sauteed peppers and onions, but also with snap peas and water chestnuts. The sauce with the dish was spicy...perhaps a bit too spicy. A few times I hit either a really hot pepper or a pepper seed that was a bit too strong and caused a burning in my throat. Aside from the rare super-heat it had an overall good spice to it. The dish also came with a side of white rice and your choice of soup. I had the soup of son which was kind of like a miso soup but with rice.   The miss' had the Pad Thai with chicken ($11) and that was also really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was extremely tastetacular. She went with the miso soup which was also pretty good. The one thing I didn't like about it was that there are huge chunks of mushrooms in it, and I am not a fan of mushrooms at all.  I was glad to see that their non-sushi was as good as their sushi. In my experience a place like this would either have amazing sushi and so-so hot food or redonkulous hot food and meh sushi. The fact that Eez gets both done so well compared to other definitely makes it one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Extremely salty--the bf says it \"tastes like someone spilled half the salt container into the food.\" Very disappointing, felt like I gained weight from the loads of fatty sauce dumped on the dish. Will never return"}
{"text":"Update on the update:  Less than a week after I posted my \"update\" review, I was contacted and was told they would love us to give Eez another try! This was absolutely sweet and very responsive of them, and I told them we would love to! Let me just mention, I'm not a fan of the ramen here, but I am a fan of the other things we have tried, previous to their team reaching out. Alright - on to the review.  We were treated so wonderfully, and our server, Michael, was great. He brought out some crab rangoon dip (my husband's fave), and we tried the seared tuna nachos. I wasn't sure if I would like them, as I'm not usually a fan of seared tuna. However, they were cooked and prepared to perfection! Delicious, fresh tuna that was placed on top of large nacho chips.   For our sushi, we tried the tropical roll and Julie's roll. The latter I believe is not on the menu, but was recommended to us. Both were delicious, and we could hardly finish both rolls after all of the appetizers.   I do still believe that their sushi is expensive per roll. However, the rolls are so stuffed with fish, sauces, toppings, etc, that one roll is all I can eat here. I do also appreciate that they don't overuse rice and use that as a big filler.   During dinner, the manager (I believe Kyle), came over and checked in with us.   The quick response to my review, and the wonderful service we received after that really shows how important the customer is to this company. I really appreciate when a business responds in such a positive way to feedback. I've seen other places get snappy or defensive to people's less than perfect reviews, and that always puts me off from going there. The fact that I didn't get a reply to my review publicly on Yelp also shows that they do care about the individual customer. It wasn't a public apology that was made into a big show. All of these little things really add up to me! Thanks, Eez & all the team."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Great portions particularly on the Nigiri. Price is a little high but you do get value for the $$$.  I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place around (I prefer over Cowfish in South Park)! Very friendly and if there's a wait you can walk around Birkdale until the buzzer goes off. I always build my own sushi roll so the $$ symbol above turns more into $$$, especially with drinks but the food meets the expectation of the high price!"}
{"text":"Doug's filet roll and the crab Rangoon dip are on point! Doug's filet roll is crab, avacado and cream cheese on inside and topped with seared filet mignon! Delish! Love the sauce they put on the wonton chips served with the dip as well! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Having lunch with friends. Nice weather to sitting outside. Sushi always good.  Not recommend hot tea."}
{"text":"After writing my first review someone on the eez fusion team reached out to me on yelp and invited me back. It is great to see when a business actually reads its reviews and values customer opinions.   I went back tonight with two of my friends. There was a bit of a wait, but we got there around 7 with the dinner rush. We were seated outside as that was the first available. You should not be worried about being cold if you get seated in the outdoor area. They enclose the patios and crank the heaters to the point that it's warmer out there than it is in the actual restaurant. If you're waiting for a table don't be afraid to tell them you'll take first available.   We tried some rolls that I had never had before tonight. One of my new favorites is the all eyes on you roll. It has crabcake and a scallop on each piece of the roll. It was something new and exciting. We also got the firecracker roll which was delicious but to me it wasn't anything special. I am all about trying their fusion and specialty rolls that are unique to the restaurant.   Service was great, our server Mark was very attentive to our table and made sure we had refills."}
{"text":"Great sushi as well as fusion stir fry. Appetizers are excellent as well. Love the Thai Cucumbers and pot stickers. I'm a big fan of the fired rice options- always big helpings. Wash it dow with a signature cocktail and you have your self a nice meal. Get their early, place is always busy.   We had a party of 7, and even with it being a busy Sat night, service was great and food was prompt. Mgr came by and asked how our service and meal was."}
{"text":"It does not get much better than Eez. Friendly service, fun, bright atmosphere and amazing food.  I have never had a bad meal here. I have also never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table even when it appears crowded.  One word of warning, it is very loud and a little dark in the evenings. The bar is a crazy pickup scene at happy hour.  The food... Oh, the food... Rolls and fried rice are heavenly. Cucumber salad is delicious. Orange chicken = another winner! You cannot go wrong with Eez."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. We were not disappointed! Very nice atmosphere has inside and outside seating. The staff is amazing. Our waitress Kelly and her manager went above and beyond for us. The food... Soooo good! Lots of vegetarian options also. Make your own sushi and all was fresh! I loved the bento box! I got a great variety.  We had two desserts, both were to die for! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure the price increase was completely unnecessary. Everything was already pretty pricy and now some sushi rolls arnt even included in the lunch special and some main dishes increased by $1-2. Bento box choices changed, literally all my favorite things to order were changed. What I am referring to was the cashew chicken choice for bento box and double salmon roll for lunch special. Def should go back to the old menu.    Came back again for lunch which I do regularly. And to my surprise the lunch menu no longer exists!!! So disappointing, continuously taking away good items and increasing prices again! So annoyed! Will take a while to ever come back again."}
{"text":"Went tonight and had our favorite waiter, Casey. As always, he recommended the perfect wine and gave us the inside scoop on the chef's special (a unique spin on grits - OMG,).   We ordered the wine and the special, as recommended. The wine was awesome (an Italian Pinot Grigio - not the most expensive one!). Our dinners were served and the head chef brought out the special. He chatted for a bit and left us to dine. As I said, the food was amazing. After dinner, the chef came back for our thoughts.    What a great night out!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the rolls here. My favorite is the volcanic; tons of spicy tuna and crispy calamari with jalapeño and cucumber for crunch. Also had a great blueberry rooibos tea. Good service just a little pricy."}
{"text":"The desire for some fried rice led me to EEZ- that and the fact that it is connected to one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants, Cowfish. There were only a few people eating on a weekday afternoon, and most were outdoors enjoying the weather and wine.  My date and I ordered calamari, seafood fried rice and beef fried rice. There were ample choices on the menu, and it took us until we almost finished the appetizer to decide on what entrees to go with. The menu made me order a sushi roll along with my fried rice. ;)  After indulging on yummy calamari, I was on my second piece of sushi when the server brought our plates of fried rice to the table. It was a huge portion! I got excited because I knew I wouldn't have to worry about what to eat for dinner- and breakfast the next morning.   It was my not my first seafood fried rice dish (after all, it's one of my favorite meals to order at Ru Sans) but it was the first to have shrimp, scallops, crab AND lobster. Not just three fingertips full of lobster, but a big chunk on top and throughout.   They have a fan in me. I also washed some of it down with the Big O martini. Heavenly!"}
