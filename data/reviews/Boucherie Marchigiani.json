{"text":"Had a craving for a good sandwich. Was my firts time there. Was not to sure when I walk in but the gentleman that served me was really welcoming and help me decided what to have and what to put in the sandwich. Tasting the sandwich now and it is really good! Will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation and man are the sandwiches good!!!

This is a little Italian grocery store with a fresh sandwich/pizza counter in the back, and their sandwiches are super good.

Great service, nice owners, and good sandwiches. Perfect when you're on the run!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes to get served and when an Italian (obviously regular) costumer came in, he got served before us. Super rude. Quality was good, but not the cheapest. Just because of the horrible service we took our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Avoir une boucherie italienne à deux pas de la maison... que demander de plus? Nous y allons pour la plupart de nos besoins en viande car ses prix sont très abordables et ses produits sont biens frais. Mon coup de cur: la saucisse italienne (douce, épicée ou au fenouil) ce n'est pas pour rien qu'ils la distribuent à plusieurs restaurants, c'est la meilleure!

Aussi, nous adorons aller dîner au marché Marchigiani. Les paninis (non pressés) sont tout simplement incroyables. Surtout celui à la porchetta (faite sur place bien sûr). En plus de sandwichs extraordinaires, ils font de délectables petits plats maison différents tous les jours. On mange sur place, entre les allées du marché ou bien, sur la terrasse ... et ça, pour moins de 10$. Incroyable non?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and that porchetta sandwich is to die for. For $10 you get a massive, freshly made to your specifications sandwich. Simply bursting full of flavor. 

The Thursday I was there at noon was madness! Long lineup but it was moving a great pace. 

They also had steaks, and other dishes as well. Great place, great food, tough at times for parking.

PRO TIP: get there before noon ;-)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick lunch near LaSalle Hospital, and their porchetta sandwiches did not disappoint. Flavourful pork, perfectly spicy sauce, and delicious bread. I can't wait to go back and shop their incredible selection of Italian pastas, meats, cheeses and other goods."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. The Porchetta is to die for. There is always something new and delicious on the lunch menu. Casual Atmosphere, limited seating, but the food is amazing. A real local hot-spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are very nice!
I'm not a huge bread person, would prefer tortilla if possible for healthy eating purposes.

Had the Porcetta 10\" all dressed and spicy sauce"}
