{"text":"Living near Markham road, I've been searching for great Pho along or near Markham road for ages.  I hadn't noticed when Lac Vien popped up but I'm glad I did!

Trip number one was fresh spring rolls, beef pho, and chicken mango salad.  I was actually hoping to order just a normal mango salad, with no meat, but I was quite happy with the chicken and the price is very reasonable.  The pho broth here is very flavorful, with a spice I can't quite place but adds a bit of a unique but understated flavor.

Trip number two I tried the satay pho.  That was disappointing as it was sort of a weak broth with some chili flakes and fish sauce added.  Not a fan. I had never seen or tried a satay pho before so I'm not one to compare.    Also had some General Tsao chicken ... just to see how they were at these dishes.  Not bad, but I'll probably stick to their traditional vietnamese dishes in the future.

Had the fried spring rolls this time and they were very good. They seemed to have addressed the issues that Chris C pointed out .. they weren't oily and the dipping sauce was perfect.

Summary - order the pho!  The 4/5 rating is entirely earned by the soup, salad, spring rolls, etc."}
{"text":"Food was actually not that bad.  The place was very clean, even the washrooms.  

The pho was pretty good.  They used the flat rice noodles instead of the traditional ones.   The amount of meat was very generous as well.   I guess the place is still relatively new, that is why the amount of meat is more than expected. 

Also ordered the grilled beef rolls.  Not bad,  sauce that came with it was the same as the shrimp rolls. 

Service was good as well.  Food came out very fast.  No complaints. Price was a little high compared to the ones in north York.  I guess they can charge a little more,  they are the only Vietnamese place around there. 

Will I come back... yes,  if in the area,  would definitely come back to this pho place."}
{"text":"Came here looking for bo 7 mon (after reading some of the reviews) and they did not serve it.  

So we ordered the pho and Thai style chicken wings.  They use ho fan in the pho which was pretty good.  Meat portions were average. The wings were the perfect size but needed to be more spicy. 

As dessert, we had banh fan. This was surprisingly good as well.  All in all, after finding out no bo 7 mon i was still pretty happy with this place.  

Price wise,  your average Vietnamese prices.  Not the cheapest and not really expensive. 

Will i come back... yes.  If in the area, I'll be back for more.  Took a quick glance at the other table and saw the rice dishes... need to get some of that next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent here whenever we want pho/lazy to cook/just hungry.  

The place is clean, service and location are good, and the pho broth is better than most. 

So far, we've only tried pho, vermicelli bowl, rice wrap,  and milkshakes.  We order all of that when we are really hungry, but for the most part - pho and a shake is our regular order. 

I prefer the pho broth (and the service) here than Pho Hung nearby. I also appreciate the ratio of ice/milk/fruit/sweetener in their milkshake - particularly the jackfruit flavour.  The bubbles (tapioca) is probably the best I've ever had in both texture/chewyness and flavour."}
{"text":"At first I was cautious of this place based on past failures at this location. I have to say they have an extensive selection food and everything I've tried has been quite good. Quick service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese food. 
I come here when I'm craving pho in the upper west side of Toronto.  

Pho is awesome. The Bun is always a winner. Fresh ingredients and excellent base broth. 

See a lot of cops here too. All times of day. This is their go to spot too!"}
{"text":"I love coming here while we're in the area for hockey practices or Bday parties! They have fresh noodles..."}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant, but after they change the people, it becomes terrible place. In passed three times, I can't say how angry I'm. First time I go with my friend, we order two same noodles, until my friend finish I still didn't see my noodles, they say they forgot. Second time I went I order noodle and spring roll, after I finished my noodle they still didn't give me the roll. (Before they serve spring rolls are very fast). Today they take my order and clean repeat to me,and after 20mins wait they said they didn't take my order, I really want to use F world this time. It became a terrible restaurant. I don't think I'll go there anymore."}
{"text":"Do not mistake the good reviews on here for the rating  because they are all from the non- Vietnamese who have never had better Vietnamese food. As I looked around I saw most customers are Spanish, Filipinos and others. I feel sorry that those people have to experience this kind of cooking unknowingly. This place cooks  the worst Vietnamese dishes. The pork chop rice dish is plain, tasteless, missing all the crucial ingredients. The plate had huge chunk of one  rice cup,  grilled pork chop with  few withered shedded cabbage pieces, one small pieceof  tomato and cucumber.  The pork chop was very tough, rubbery.  It almost flew off the plate as I was trying to cut it into pieces. There was no fried green onion in oil nor shedded pork skin mixed with fried rice crumbs. There were not any pickles either. I am talking about carrot, radish pickles. This is the dish in which the broken rice has to be used. What the hell do those cooks in the kitchen do? Here comes another insult to the Cambodian dish : the  Phnom Penh rice noodles soup was the silliness of all. It was colorless, plain and the broth was full of Japanese SMG. The pork sausage topping was smelly because it was not seasoned with the right spices. I am pretty sure they used tap water and full bag of SMG for the broth. No basils, lettuce or any vegetables given to go with the dish but boiled bean sprouts? My tongue was tingling and the bitterness after taste. That is what Japanese SMG does.  This style of cooking is very unprofessional in taste and presentation.
One star for the ambience, one star for the service from female servers ( as disappointed as I was I still left tip for their hard work )  but of course  a big fat ZERO star for the taste.
The food here is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Lac Vien one night when I was feeling under the weather and in the mood for Pho,  and my go to spot was way too far to trek to.  I searched for nearby places and Lac Vien came up, I was hesitant at first but decided to try anyways.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food.  I've been back twice since!"}
{"text":"When you go for Vietnamese, you expect quick service.  That was completely opposite to what we received tonight.  One of my appetizers didn't arrive until 40 mins after we ordered -- and AFTER the rest of my family had finished their dinners.  When I mentioned this there was no real apology, only a comment about them being busy.  It's funny that half the tables were empty.  With so many options for Vietnamese in the area, don't bother going to this place."}
{"text":"I've driven past Lac Vien many times on my way to Yorkdale and had never realised that there lied a great Vietnamese restaurant. 

I've been here two times already and I always love the food. I ordered the stir fried beef with vegetables on steamed rice and it was very good: ingredients were fresh and tasty!

I dared to try their spring rolls: wasn't impressed, but that won't stop me from coming here as their main dishes and Pho are delicious. 

This place is definitely a hidden gem and the price is pretty good. Two people can dine here for 25$. 

I shall be back for more!"}
{"text":"Very affordable good portion and good quality pho and rice dishes

would come here again."}
{"text":"Food is always fast and really good! Eveything that I've tried on the menu has not disappointed me. This js my go to spot for pho."}
{"text":"New store, so clean atmosphere + friendly staff. Other than that, the pho itself was disappointing. While you could smell herbs if you hover your nose over the bowl, it was nearly impossible to taste it. It felt like I was eating beef noodle soup rather than pho. The broth was also too salty & overdosed with MSG, while parts of the beef brisket slices were too tough to chew.

Never again."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. It was nice and clean. Food came quickly after ordering.  Ordered the large House special pho and the deep fried spring rolls.  Both were pretty good.  I'd recommend this place and come back again."}
{"text":"Pho didn't Tasted right, I think they cooked to service the Indian people. Most of their customer were not Asian.  Pho tasted bad bad bad......"}
{"text":"For where it is, this place is actually quite good. And they often have vietnamese cooking shows on. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Went here after church, so it was a late morning meal (after 11 am).  Approx. 2-3 other tables being served, so most of the restaurant was empty. 

Being a Vietnamese restaurant, there were no Vietnamese speaking waiters. This makes is a bit difficult to communicate (mostly for my grandparents and parents)

We gave in our order and waited for 30 minutes.  Turns out the waiter didn't even give our order into the kitchen.

Tea was extremely bitter, we asked to change it twice but the awful taste remained.

Hu Tieu is a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup served with a variety of meats and seafood (i.e. fish balls, shrimp, squid, different pork cuts, etc.). So it is safe to say I expected that. They really skimped out and only had shrimp as the topping. 

With so many mistakes, you would think that the employees would apologize or give a discount, but no. Nothing."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out since it's close to home and we love Pho. Sadly, we think it's overpriced and not exceptionally good either. Staff were nice but didn't speak any Vietnamese so could not take my off-the-menu orders or search for items on the menu for me that could not be found. Overall, we will likely return only for the distance (that is highly unlikely) but not for the food."}
{"text":"Close to work, this place is a welcome option in a sea of Italian restos and chain restaurants.  We order for take out  there at least once a week!  What to order?  Great pho, fantastic bun, and always a pork and chicken bahn mi.  

Nice and clean, it gets VERY busy at lunch time so be prepared to park on the street.  We always call ahead for take out and that works out for us.  

We also used them for catering recently and it worked out perfectly.  Silver take out trays of anything off their menu for a reasonable price and they delivered right on time to our office for our open house.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"No vegetarian pho based options. Even the vegetables with tofu pho is a chicken broth base. Only got stars because of the very pleasant servers."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was amazing for the first 6 months. Now the quality has gone down tremendously. I can't even eat all the shrimp that come in my pad Thai. Some are gutted and some are not fully gutted. Like that's ridiculous to gut half of a shrimp and not the rest. I always order the H4 thai beef stew and now I don't anymore because the beef is so tough I can't even swallow it..What happened to this place? I used to recommend this place to all my friends.."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. We ordered seafood Pho and shrimp mango salad.

Their mango salad here is good (though i do wish for crunchy onion chips and cilantro), it was satisfying. I like the dressing they put in it. They give a good amount for an order. Enough to split for two as an appetizer. 

Their pho is good, it satisfies and i have no complaints about it. The noodles are always cooked just fine and the broth was consistent. The seafood had a good variety but dont expect for too much shrimp. I'm sure you can order more if you want. Ask for satay sauce if you like your pho spicy instead of settling for sri racha (it has more a bite and add a garlic taste)

I have also had their thai curry, they give a good portion of white rice. Their curry wasn't too strong. Flavour was just right (disclaimer: I havent been to Thailand but I've had relative amount of Thai curry). They present it in a simple but satisfying way.

I know i will come back here because its relatively close and crave their mango salad once in a while.

Parking is free in the lot it shares with other businesses.

They have relatively good amount of seating. 

They tend to be packed most of the time i'm there.

You can also enjoy their bubble tea (variety of flavours) for dessert."}
{"text":"Had the pho tai and I've never been so disappointed.  The broth was the oiliest and the meat was so gross full of fat.  I felt my arteries clogging.  These ppl need to get leaner cuts of meat.  Straight up nasty! I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to eat original Vietnamese food. Very good food, very good service,  friendly people, nice and smiling faces. I am a regular here, observing the service and the customers.  I can tell that are a lot of returning customers,  and the parking lot is always full. Portions are bid and taste is good."}
{"text":"Delicious !!! My bf and I ordered chicken pho, veggie spring rolls, pad Thai & beef chunks w rice... It's soooo Yummie!! Good service, clean & spacious ! Servers are friendly and super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Clean and spacious. Recommend the beef pho, bon rieu and Phnom Penh noodles (dry style). Fast service. Their original location is near Lawrence and Caledonia."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the west end. I usually order vermicelli ask feel they make it quite good here. I prefer pho and rice from other places.  The vermicelli is really tasty and fresh. They use better quality of meats than some other places I've been to - there is less fat on the meat and they are more generous with the portions. The veggies are always really fresh as well. The service and atmosphere are above average for a Vietnamese restaurant and the restaurant is extremely clean which I think is a good indication that the owners really care about quality."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently and really enjoyed it. The food was good, the atmosphere was great and the prices are awesome too. I tried their pho and it was really good and filling for the cheap price! Service was awesome - very fast all around - and the staff were wonderful. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu :)"}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of another Vietnamese restaurant downtown that frequently dominates in the top 3 Vietnamese restaurants in the city on blogger lists.  

The pho broth has a pretty good depth of flavour in spite of its relatively transparent colour - a sign, I've been told, is indicative of an authentically delicious pho.  The small phos, I've found, are a bit scarce on their beef and meats, so if you care about this stuff make sure you order a Large size.  
Not sure why, but this place (like most other Vietnamese restaurants) only offer a Small, Large, or Extra Large bowl of pho.

We also ordered the Thai chicken wings, which are the regular fried chicken wings with some pan-fried bell peppers, chillies, and pepper-salt.  The waitstaff had recommended this over the regular ones, and she was right - I was glad we had these too. 

Drinks are actually not bad here too, and the shakes are purportedly made with real fruit rather than powder.  I got the avocado shake last time, and I would be willing to order it again.  The salted lime soda is strangely the same price as the shakes ($3.50) which I found a bit high, but ehh, you can visit Lac Vien without breaking the bank anyway."}
{"text":"Its Authentic Good Healthy Quick Great to have a restaurant like this in the Neighbourhood. RB Inc Bicycle Store is just down the street too!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and both were misses. The interior looks much nicer than most Vietnamese joints, but it's a shame the food doesn't match that standard.

Pho broth lacked seasoning and all-round flavour. It's like they tried to save money by putting in one less scoop of pho concentrate. Noodles & toppings were pretty standard.

Had a mango shake that was also pretty watery. At least they were consistent... everything just lacks intensity of flavour."}
{"text":"Order the seafood veggie pho and it was delish!  Ingredients were very fresh and the shrimp were plentiful and ginormous!  Their fresh and deep fried spring rolls were yummy too!  The durian milkshake was a little too sweet - but not awful.  Fair prices and great service!  Would def come back!  :)"}
{"text":"This place is close to my home although its in an odd location next to some auto mechanic shops and a public storage place. 

Been here a few times. Food tastes good. Prices and portions is also good. My only complaint would be the menu. This place you are supposed to write down your order on the piece of paper they have you and so if you are not careful you could end up ordering the wrong dish. I intended to order a dish labelled CX12 but I mistakenly wrote C12 which was for a completely different dish. It was my fault so I accepted the food. However I wish they would change the labels to bit different to reduce mistakes by customers."}
{"text":"LacVien is a fairly decent Vietnamese restaurant that does an okay job at satisfying the craving. It surely beats out their neighbouring McDonalds. However it would not be a choice restaurant to visit. We tried it because we were driving by and it was lunch time.

We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer because we like to try them at each restaurant. They were okay, nothing to write home about. The filling was standard, no complaints, but the skin wasn't crispy enough. The fish sauce was also quite light. 

The pho was hit and miss. 

The broth was quite tasty but it had too much oil on top for my personal preference. The pot could use a skimming of oil. However the soup came piping hot! Great job! The noodles were the dry rice noodle style which I really like over the fresh rice noodles. The Dac Biet (house special pho) did not come with the rare beef! The brisket was very fatty and sinewy and was just a poor cut of meat. Likewise, the meat balls were small and lacklustre. The portion for a large was decent, I had a good fill. 

We rounded out the meal with a mango milkshake which was just okay. It came in a bubble-tea style container that made me think it was just a pre-packaged product and not freshly made in-house. 

They had ample high chairs and booster seats for small children so they are family friendly. The washrooms were spacious and very very clean. Good job!

However the food did not impress us very much and we've had better."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the clean modern environment, this Vietnamese restaurant serves true authentic dishes. You know it when the pho is accompanied by more than just Thai basil and bean sprouts. The rice dish was served with soup, which is a fading service in the Toronto core. Too bad this place is too far from my home.

Fantastic."}
{"text":"Wife and I were in the mood for some Pho, our usual Pho spot is Vietnam Noodle Star, we were up for an alternative location and this was closer to home.  However, when we arrived, we changed our minds from Pho to some dish leaning towards grilled.  So we opted for : A3 Fresh roll w/chicken, vermicielli & mixed veg & dipping sauce, c5 grilled chicken w/steam rice and c8 grilled beef w/steam rice for my wife.

We enjoyed our meal, glad that they had the grilled offerings along with Pho offerings.  We consider this a $$ eats place, since we are able to both get full on a budget of $25.00-$30.00 before HST.  Usually we do our best to avoid restos that push our meal budget close to $50.00.  Our only exception is hot pot places or AYCE.

As of this writing we have made a 2nd visit for a shared bowl of chicken Pho.

For our budget, this place is worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"We were craving pho so went searching.  With the help of Yelp, we found this place. It wasn't hard to find but you may at fort mistaken it for a breakfast diner.  The interior looks like it was converted to a Vietnamese restaurant with minimal redecorating.  All that doesn't matter, we just wanted good eats.  Bear in mind we were already very hungry when we arrived.  We ordered a large rare beef pho and a rice plate with spring rolls and pork chops.  We must have waited 40 mins when we noticed people who came after us already received their food and some even left.  Nobody came to us to find out what was going on until we finally flagged a waitress down.  She went to check and another waiter came over to tell us that their computer crashed and they couldnt retrieve our order.  Clearly that wasnt true because everyone else got their food except for us. I'm sure they just lost our orders and just made up an excuse for their screw up.  I was too hungry to engage in any logical argument so I just gave him our order again.  The food came and all I can say that it was just average and the fact that they made up an excuse for their mistake, I would say my experience here was below average."}
{"text":"There's been a recent surge in pho places in markham / Scarborough so I decided to check this place out. The clean renovated interior met my approval as I was quickly seated and given a large menu. Seriously the menu has tons of items and the suspicious part of me thinks it's one of those places that produces a huge quantity of mediocre quality items. Was I right? Sadly yes. I ordered a large rare beef and tripe pho and fresh spring rolls - my typical order at a pho place. The rolls weren't really fresh, somewhat flaccid, like they sat in the fridge for a little bit beforehand. The pho gave a similar impression at best. The broth was weak in colour and fragrance. Good pho broth should be aromatic but subtle, which this wasn't. The rare beef came well done ... And that's all I really have to say right? I bit too pricey for the quality, but I guess you're paying for the cleanliness that's absent from the more frequented pho joints.

Would I come back? Pho-getaboutit"}
{"text":"Went here tonite for the first time.  Our pho came with a huge piece of hair!  We sent it back and still got charged for our meal.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner recently and enjoyed my meal. We started with the fresh roll with shrimp, vermicelli and vegetables, it was ok, pretty standard offering. My my dinner, i had the grilled beef, spring roll and vermicelli. Meat was charcoal grilled, tender and flavourful and was a decent portion, the vermicelli were nice and chewy, the vegetables were fresh and abundant and the spring roll was good. My dining companion opted for pho and the aroma wafting from the bowl was enticing, they thoroughly enjoyed it. I would come back again, it was decent and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This was my go to Viet place... there was a cockroach in my meal. We would go here or get take out here almost once a week. It was always good and the last year the pho broth was hit or miss and the pieces of beef they would put in varied in quality. 

We went a couple weeks ago and decided on the hot pot for 2. We have had it a few times and is always good. There was a cockroach still twitching in the food after we ate 2/3 of the meal. 

We informed the waitress who said oh my god and then walked away with the bowl. No one came back. No one checked on us, offered the bill or came to say anything. So we get up to pay and the lady at the cash said oh Mother Nature problem or something and that it was from the vegetables. She offered us 20% off only if we would pay cash. 

Wash your vegetables if that is where it came from. We won't be returning and we would have been happy to if the service was better and they offered a better discount and not only if we paid cash."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place when it first opened after Beaver and bulldog closed. That was sometime ago before I began using yelp. Some friends came by today, and invited me out for lunch. As I am always game for food, I went along. When they wanted to go tho this place, I was somewhat hesitatant. As they reassured me, and we went. The service was better than I remembered. I ordered #c4,  the beef and prok on rice with soup. It was actually quite good and inexpensive at 8.95$. As I have been trying to avoid pop, I drank the tea. The staff could have been more diligent interms of keeping the said tea kettle full. I finished with a Vietnamese coffee, which is a slow pressed strong espresso mixed with condensed milk (no sugar is necessary). I have developed an affinity for these really strong coffees as not much else affects me anymore. Overall, will be going back. I gave it a 4/5 due to my previous experience and the tea pot not being refilled in a timely manner. Otherwise, good to go."}
{"text":"Came here one sat afternoon as we drove by.  Place was pretty busy.  Food quality is good but price a but higher than other Viet place but seeing where they are located I can see why.  Overall my chicken and beef rice was very good.  Beef was BBQ and you can taste the BBQ flavor.  Very thin beef is the only concern but it was filling.   Chicken was average nothing to complain about.  The pho is smaller it seems but pretty tasty, had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple times as well as the one in Markham and I really think that their quality is pretty consistent.

I love their food and, personally, I think their soup bases are less oily than other restaurants like Pho 88. I've tried their milkshakes here too and they are made well in my opinion. Service is really good and their waitresses are friendly and attentive. On my last visit, my mango milkshake was a bit sour so one of the girls named Hanna offerred to remake it. Regardless, the flavour was fresh so it was still good despite the sourness. You can actually TASTE the mango.

I usually get the House Special Pho because it has a variety of meats and its a good go-to. Most pho places really can't mess that up and if they do, then they have failed hard. Their sizes for bowls are reasonable and they give enough meat and bean sprouts. Not cheaping out on anything here which is great to know! I've also tried their Tom Yum soup options and their spicy beef stew noodles which are great too if you want some more flavour.

If there was a Lac Vien closer to where I live, I would make that my primary pho place. They have good variety and good quality plus pretty reasonable price. Sooooo what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I have been coming here to get my weekly dose of pho since it opened. Super happy to have a pho restaurant so close to home. The inside is nice and clean and the washrooms are also very spacious. 

Pho prices are as standard like any other pho restaurant. I really enjoy how clear the broth tastes, not very oily either. I always order dry noodles because if you don't specify that they will automatically give you fresh noodles (fresh noodles are my biggest pet peeve when eating pho)

The service is pleasant - not spectacular. My only issues are that they don't have a napkin dispenser and they only give a napkin per customer so having to ask for more can get a little annoying. But overall this is definitely a place I will continue to go to."}
{"text":"I love business lunches! I don't usually go to this part of Toronto, so it's ripe to visit a new place! My colleagues love this place and go every time they're in the area. It must be good! They did all of the ordering which took the pressure off me. I already had to prove I could use chopsticks. 

It's bright and airy; lots of light and windows. It's monochromatic and has lots of comfortable booths. The menu has many pages with many photos. I'm glad they ordered, because I didn't know where to start! Everything looked so good and there were many items I'd never tried. Not only that, but the prices were phenomenal; most lunch dishes were under $10. 

We started with a shrimp roll with veggies & vermicelli in rice paper. It came with a clear, fish sauce for dipping. I was scared of the fish sauce; all I could think of was having fish breath all day. They reassured me that it was delicious. I dipped a chopstick to taste and was I shocked. It was sweet! Sweet? I know, I was confused too. I dipped the roll into the sauce to try more. It went perfectly and only had a hint of fish flavour. (I'm also happy to report that I did not taste it for the rest of the day, as I'd feared.) 

Vermicelli time! Feeling overwhelmed with the menu choices, I had whatever they had. Grilled Chicken Vermicelli with Spring Rolls it is! The grilled chicken was tender and juicy; along side a garden salad, this dish was a winner! The spring roll was pretty standard. I'm Italian; I've had my fair share of standard, Japanese and Thai noodles, but these were different. They were thin, white and light. They weren't has heavy, like your standard udon noodle, and man are they slippery! My chopsticks skills were failing miserably. There was no way I could finish it, not due to skill, due to the sheer amount of food.  

We had just started eating when our server brought another plate of food that we didn't order. I think she was new. When we told her she went all 'deer in headlights' on us. She would verify our orders and then disappear for a long time. She was pleasant and the food was good, so we didn't mind. Gotta learn somewhere! 

What a great first time trying Vietnamese food! I'd love to return to Lac Vien. The quality and presentation of their food is absolutely something they take pride in. By looking around, they have a lot of happy customers!  

I'm glad I had some experts with me. Sometimes the best way to experience a new cuisine is to have an expert with you. They make sure you don't miss out on anything!"}
{"text":"This place has been really consistent with their pho...and I have been here over 10 times now.  The broth is really good and the thicker noodles are a nice change.  What I like the most is their satay sauce that I ask them to put in my special pho soup.  This satay is so good and spicy that I don't need to add anything else to the soup besides the veggies and herbs they provide.  Without the satay I add hot sauce and hoisin galore.  So when I order I write down P1 large w/ satay.  Their spring rolls are ok and their fresh rolls are pretty good.  I always order the Chinese doughnut on the side which is only $1.50 and has a nice crispy texture to accompany the soup.  It's not on the menu just ask for it or write down Chinese doughnut or fried breadstick on the order sheet.   Service is always good."}
{"text":"I had a serious craving for pho after all my pinning of Asian food on pinterest. I went with my girl to this location as it was pretty close to our house. We sat down to a pretty quiet night at the restaurant. The gps for some reason told us to make a u turn too early when going north on markham road. Ignore that. Just turn at the light where the mcdonalds is and you'll find it in that plaza. The prices were pretty decent and there were tons of options. We got the cream cheese wontons and I got the sautéed beef pho well done. It came out all at the same time after like 5 minutes. My girlfriend got the veggies and tofu. She really enjoyed it and said it cleared up her cold. Mine was nice and spicy and I added more hot sauce like a crazy person. The small bowl was insanely huge for 6.50. My only complaint was that not all my beef seemed well done and I had to pick at any pieces that looked raw. I also wish the wontons had more filling as it was so freaking good! For two \"small\" bowls and the dumplings with tax came to 21 dollars. My kind of price! Will definitely come back. I don't know if they take credit but their debit machine was broken so we had to pay cash. Just a heads up =)"}
{"text":"Food was ok but it's not the best. There were lots to choose from as well. Just a WARNING to be careful because  my iphone was stolen there. Please watch your belongings."}
{"text":"Came here today for dinner. Have high expectations for freshly cooked food. I ordered bun w beef and minced shrimp (B9). It turned out the beef was not freshly cooked off the grill, I touched it with my finger, beef is cold as ice. I figured they must have cut corner on time and pre-cooked the beef and freeze it.  Then re-heat in the microwave and serve to customer. The ice coffee wasn't that bad, menu showed dripping but came in a glass w ice in it.  Would I come back here again?  Definitely not.   There's a lots of better Vietnamese restaurant around.  Like the one on Kennedy Road.  Price was pretty high too, my bun came in $11.95 and the ice coffee was $3.95."}
{"text":"There is a MAJOR attitude problem and VERY negative vibe in this place. Have always gone here with my brother but seems it's under new management or something. There's some new broad behind the counter with glasses who has a MAJOR problem with life and is taking it out on her customers, like us. 

I brought my man here a couple times and recommended the egg meat cake in addition to the meat meal. He thought it was repulsive to say the least and to be quite honest he said that he had an allergy to fish so that he could return it and get a couple cheap shreds of meat instead. Now listen. She complains then brings 2 thin shavings of beef after a 5 minute spiel about allergies then huffs and puffs then walks away. We pay and discover that she still charged for the egg meat cake. Fine. Pay and leave.

Return the next couple weeks and order the same deal except for no egg meat cake.  Does she not get into saying EVERY STUPID STINKING TIME, \"are you allergic to this or that\" sarcastically.  We have been back about 2 times since and if it's not her asking she will tell the other waiters to ask. VERY ANNOYING GUYS!!!!!!!!!! He obviously thought the food sucked and made up the fact he had an allergy you stupid idiot!!!!! 

Every visit angry faces and just rotten atmosphere. When you have a service oriented business you must treat ALL CLIENTS LIKE ROYALTY. Happy faces and warm welcomes upon entering the establishment, not frowns and scowls like in this dump. It's obvious these people hate their lives as most in the city because they're overworked and have no lives or money, but don't take it out on us!!! We put money in your empty pockets!! Give us at least fake smiles and fake exits and greetings, maybe we will leave you more than 50 cents tip.

Have a great night. Oh, but probably, you won't."}
{"text":"Group of us came here after an escape game at Mayze nearby. It's like a minute away.

Restaurant appears to be well-maintained. Floors are clean. Tables look clean. Hallway to washroom is clean. Washrooms are clean.

Napkins are provided by the wait-staff, but spoons and chopsticks are available for taking at each table.

All of the menu listings feature vietnamese, english, and chinese names.

We ordered a variety of dishes, and most of them looked pretty good in terms of portion size and presentation. Prices were pretty decent as well.

I got the house special pho in a large bowl. They offer three sizes: small ($7.00), large ($8.25), and extra-large ($9.50). Wonder how big the XL is... 

The flavoring overall is pretty light on its own, which I like. Wasn't too salty or oily. You could add some sauces if the flavor is too light. The different parts of the beef were also lightly flavored but had its taste. For some reason the beef balls were really small, though perhaps they were made of actual beef? I've never seen such small balls before.

The others had dishes that looked pretty nice as well, with fairly large portions."}
{"text":"I've passed by this cafe/restaurant so many times on Caledonia and have always been too busy to stop in...until today Feb 13 2016.. the coldest day of the year. I was just coming off of a bad cold. So naturally the doctor's prescription is Pho.  

Lac Vien has an impressive menu and reminds me of a friendly bustling urban diner .. only it's in an industrial zone on the edge of urbanity in North York. But don't be fooled. You'll see people from every walk of life enjoying a meal here.

For as little as $7 you can get a small Pho bowl to fill you up (unless you haven't eaten in days don't buy an XL Pho). My wife and I started off with some veggie spring rolls. Not too oily, crunchy and perfectly paired with their homemade Sriracha that's present at every table. My wife and shared the veggie and seafood Pho as well as the Chicken Satay Pho. The veggie seafood Pho came with fresh beansprouts and basil that smelled so delightful and tasted so fresh that I thought I was back in Hanoi where we first discovered authentic Pho. The Chicken Satay Pho had just the right amount of spice but the homemade Sriracha enhances the taste if you like spicy. Many Pho places I've been to brings their bowls out steaming hot and you are left waiting a long time before it's cool enough to eat. Not at Lac Vien. The temperature is just right.

I've gotta stress again that prices where super reasonable. For coffee, tea, appetizers and copious amounts of high quality Pho for two, our bill came out to $25.99

Finally I had the hot coffee with condensed milk. It was the best way to end a meal before heading out into the cold again. 

My only complaint is that it gets a little drafty in that place. The windows look like they could use better insulation.

Bravo Lac Vien Bravo!"}
{"text":"Solidly good, however nothing special. We were a large group and got a bunch of dishes to try. Got the fried rice with beef and pineapple (fine), shrimp fried rice (also fine), shrimp hot plate ( very good), veggie soup with extra shrimp (good), beef stew noodle soup (OK), fresh rolls and fried spring rolls (good). Also tried their avocado smoothie. What I liked was they bring a big plate of all the assorted toppings ( thai basil, like and bash spirits) and don't skimp. Also the avocado smoothie was great! Fresh avocado flavor and no skimping."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pho places. More than I can count.
I wanted to try it because it was close to my house and I felt like trying a new place. 

I ordered special pho and spring rolls.The soup is bubbly, and not in that fun way, the gross kind where you boil raw meat and foamy bubbles rise to the surface to haunt your bean sprouts kind of way. I think that should give you a picture of what the soup tasted like. The spring rolls are bland. 

Service is horrible. servers are inattentive and have no clue about the menu, if they didn't have uniforms, I wouldn't have guessed in a million years that they work there. 

Bad, with a sad face."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Pho was perfect today, broth was sweet and meat thin. Don't remember having the big noodles the last time I was there, but those are my fave so I was pleasantly surprised. Rice was wet just like I like it lol not too bland nor salty. Spring rolls were okay, definitely not worth the $4 bucks. 


I miss when this place was Beaver & Bulldogs. Its a Westernized Vietnamese restaurant, never been a fan of those as the food isn't made to taste as authentic."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for the 7 Beef Course aka Bo 7 Mon. Sauces are made perfectly which is an important  part for this dish, plus they give you loads of veggies. Service is always attentative and its affordable!"}
{"text":"I was told by my parents that there are only a handful of dishes that are actually good here - the pho and the spring rolls. 

Having tried so many Viet places in the area, I gotta say, the pho is pretty good. The broth is the good kind. It's meaty and flavorful and has a clean taste that doesn't leave you thirsty afterwards. The beef balls have a nice bouncy texture to it, and the noodles are thin and slurp-worthy. The spring rolls were also pretty good. Deep fried to a light crisp on the outside but packed with meat and taro on the inside. 

We also ordered the dry vermicelli noodle dish, which had a generous portion of pork on top, but it was only mediocre. The pork was a little on the dry side and the flavours were fairly bland. It would've been nice to have pickled daikon or something to go with it. 

Overall, this place is good for a quick, cheap, and healthy meal.

HOWEVER, I gotta point out that I was extremely unsatisfied with the service. The employees loiter around, are inattentive, and even after acknowledging you when you have your hand up, they leisurely take their time to get back to you. Some of the employees seemed clueless about the menu, and when we asked for the bill, they told us to get up and pay at the counter.. They get a fair bit of business even on a weekday night but it's clear that they're understaffed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of three Vietnamese restaurants my family and I patronize in our local area, this one being three times as far from our house.  Despite the distance and no delivery option, we enjoy our food here.  Very nice variety of menu items to choose from...appetizers, salads, Pho, vermicelli, egg noodles, soup, rice, pad Thai, stirfry and beverages.  Helps as I'm quite fickle and appreciate variety.  Quality has always been consistently good.  Service is quite prompt too.  They seem to have a loyal lunch and dinner crowd, even on weekdays.  Only complaint is they recently increased their menu prices, an extra 20 cents to $1.50 for many menu items.  Makes it a bit pricey for Vietnamese food but still a steal compared to standard Canadian fare."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of memories for me and this was the first time here.  Why?  It used to be a pub years ago (Beaver and Bulldog).  It used to be an Arby's years before that.  The furniture place next door used to be Logic Computer.  Businesses change on Dundas \"like a girl changes clothes\" it seems.  It's true places do come and go but to me this is a place I'm pretty sure will stick around for some time to come.

This place is just east of the Dixie on the south side.  The parking is a tricky thing however.  They have some parking along the back but to park on the side there's a small cul-de-sac type lot which can only fit maybe 8 cars.  It's safe to say this place uses a lot more than 8 spots because when we were there on a Saturday evening it was pretty packed.

The menu seems to be a mix of Vietnamese, Thai, and some Chinese dishes all with codes to correspond to the item.  If a dish is say fried rice it will begin with \"FR-\" for instance.  The Vietnamese dishes consist of various meat dishes, pho, and dishes with vermicelli, other noodles or rice, steamed or fried such as lemon grass etc.  The Thai would have spicy curry dishes, pad thai, or other things not necessariliy with peanuts etc.  The Chinese dishes would be things like sweet and sour, General Tso, etc.  The menu is pretty much all mixed together with many nice photos of the dishes and a pretty wide variety.

While you can order individual sized plates, basically meat dishes with rice or noodles you can also an entire fried rice and entire meat dishes (family style) which is what we did.  

We ordered vegetable spring rolls, pork and vegetable spring rolls, mango salad with chicken, beef stir fry with rice noodles, stir fry chicken in black bean, Thai fried rice, and my wife had a coconut milkshake.  

Each dish was very good and all the ingredients seemed very fresh, especially the vegetables.  Nothing was overly hot and I added my own hot sauce on top of my food which they had on the side along with everything else you would expect such as soy sauce etc.  They have chop sticks at the table so if you want forks etc you would have to ask them.  They do bring serving spoons to you for the plates though.  

The servings are generous for the prices.  Between the 3 of us the bill after taxes came out to about 55 bucks and we had left overs.  My favorite dish was probably the beef stir fry and noodles.  

When we were leaving we saw our neighbor with his whole family having dinner.  He told me that they've been coming to Lac Vien for a while and that he always get a new dish every visit.  He also said their food is very good which is why they keep coming back.  I have to agree it was very good and we'll be back too."}
{"text":"Pass by this place so many times that I can't count.  I usually don't like Vietnamese places that much because my husband and I just kept going to the same place over and over.  This time finally we decided to try it and oh man this got to be the best noodles I ever had!  It is very authentic and now I know why some famous chefs love Vietnamese noodles so much.  I am definitely going back to try their rice too.

Well, I went back there to try the fried rice, and it was even more awesome than then the noodles!!!  I order that everytime when I go there now...  =P"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night bite a couple months ago. I ordered some sort of seafood dish which I didn't really like but my boyfriend's dish I LOVED. He got the bo luc lac (shaking beef) and it was full of flavour. The meat was tender, not chewy or tough and it was marinated well. Next time I will try the pho!"}
{"text":"Been trying out and looking for the best pho joints in the Scarborough / Markham area lately. The reviews for this new place looks good so I decided to give it a try.

Ordered the House Special pho in large for $7.50. Broth was pretty good and flavorful. Not overly salty or greasy. Fair amount of meats and noodle. What I like best was the texture of the noodle; smooth and firm, not over-soaked like some places. I guess they used the fresh type.

Got the fried Vietnamese spring rolls too. Very good. Fresh, crispy, not too salty, and the least greasy I've encountered so far. I would order it again.

Overall, the place still feels clean and new because I think they only opened in January, according to the green health inspection sign at the door. No sticky feel like some places. Same goes for the washroom.

Music was loud mellow songs from the 80s.

Before I came to Lac Vien, I liked Viet Noodle Star and Pho 88 at Bamburgh Circle. Now I have another favorite to add to my list.


I would come back again.


One more reason to come back is the Lindt store I discovered across the lot. I'm not sure how long this store has been here but it's a new find for me. They got lots of loose pieces you can buy by weight and got some flavors I haven't seen in regular retail stores like balls with these fillings: champagne, citrus, coffee, cappuccino. Plenty of dark chocolates, which is what I prefer. I really like that I can buy a couple of pieces of each to try instead of a whole bag of one flavor. Quite a number of customers in the store today since it's lunch time and the day before Valentine's Day. Also have a Ghirardelli products on the side."}
{"text":"Worst bun (vermicelli) I've ever had. Noodles were warm (supposed to be cold). If I wanted warm noodles I would have ordered it in a soup. Pork was also burnt, sausage was gross and spring roll was just meh bc it was mostly bean."}
{"text":"The food is okay, I found hair in my food. twice. didn't bother me i just threw out the food, 
but the services SUCKS. i accidentally dropped  my drink, said i was sorry, The waitress assumed that i don't speak the language (Vietnamese) and starts calling me stupid and old and saying that it was my fault. repeatedly announcing  it to the staff. SERIOUSLY?!?! 
On top of it it took them 15 min to make a stupid bubble tea. but the replacement took 5 mins? 


All i have to say, come here if you want to made fun of,. and find hair in your food, 
Their customer services is shit when you actually know what they are saying,  
These SHITTY waitresses that work here are the reason why Vietnamese people and culture have a bad reputation."}
{"text":"I go here from time to time. It's beside a McDonald's. Service is fine. Food is decent. Typical Vietnamese restaurant. Price is average."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Vietnamese food. Contrary to most people's experience, I do not usually get thirsty after having the pho broth.

However, I can clearly remember how salty their food was, and how thirsty I was after finishing a regular bowl of pho at this place. The thirst in my mouth did not die down even later that day and I had to pour down a lot of water to quench my thirst.

Not recommended. The service was quick and friendly here though."}
{"text":"Had the pho Dac Biet. Pretty good. Noodles slightly over cooked but all in all it was good and authentic. Also had the goi cuon Tom (shrimp) and it was prepared properly with a good balance of shrimp, lettuce, and noodles. 
The avocado smoothie was great!
I recommend this place if you are looking for a good authentic Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"Their Viet Coffee is serious stuff. I'm a night shifter so I like that they're open late, then I can get some reliable caffeine after hours. Keyword: (very) reliable. I like to go for their condensed milk iced coffee @ $3.25. It is sweet to combat the bitterness, but not overly sweet. I like that once it sets inside your mouth after taking a sip, the balance of bitter-sweet just finds itself. It's like magic to me, and joy comes to me with every sip ^^ [ you really just gotta try for yourself! ] Usually I drink it halfway, and add more ice to it. And voilà! A second serving! Because condensed milk is used, it's not as diluted as it sounds.

Food: is authentic and legit. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I've had the pho, bun, and rice and they're all really good! I don't find it msg-heavy, or any for that matter. Food is lightly seasoned with the usual condiments at the tableside. Prices and portions are reasonable. Service is fast.

Space: looks recently renovated so it's new & clean. Spacious. Comfortable seating. Good for groups like your evening/late night sports teams.

It's an all-round restaurant. It doesn't get any more simple & straightforward than that. If you're ever in the area and need a quick bite, I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is my spot for local Vietnamese/Thai style food. Extremely clean and they play SiriusXM Love, satellite radio. I would recommend (M8) on the menu - Thai style stir fried noodles w/shrimp,chives bean sprout, and roasted peanuts."}
{"text":"Sorry I have dock one star from my previous review.  While this place still has very good quality Vietnamese food, I feel like H4 (beef stew with rice noodle) has a bit less lemongrass, herbs and meat than before and has been replaced with chili oil.  

Still a solid place, much better presentation than other Vietnamese places and still worth a 15 minute drive to get to this place."}
{"text":"The menu here is broad offering a variety of items including spring rolls, Thai beef salad, pho, egg noodle soup, vermicelli (rice noodles without broth), pad Thai, fried rice, rice dishes, deep fried food, hot pot, fish and bubble tea.  Pho prices range from $8.50 - $11.50.  The inside is spacious with both booth seating and table seating options.

I went with H4 - Thai beef stew with rice noodles $10 and the broth was good.  It was slightly spicy and has pieces of tender beef.  There was plenty of noodles and they were nicely done.

There was plenty of parking in the parking lot.  The password for the free wifi was posted on the wall, but when I connected there was no service.

{"text":"I have been to Lac Vien a couple times as a change of pace to my usual Viet place. My family and I have tried a variety of options such as pho, bün (vermicelli noodles), soft noodles with beef, salad rolls, seafood birds nest and fried rice. 

While most of the items are pretty good and quite fresh, the restaurant has a habit of making incorrect orders. Three times I have ordered pork bün and been given beef bün.  Also, I am not a big fan of their peanut sauce which tastes more like peanut butter than actual satay sauce. The \"satay\" sauce is also so thick it is difficult to dip my salad roll into it without half the ingredients falling into the sauce. (I double dip,  *don't judge!*) Literally, I have put my roll into the sauce only for it to break in half and only be left with the stub. :(

Lastly, if you are looking for a true seafood birds nest, this one does not deliver on the seafood part which is barely there.  The picture is really deceiving.

So while the food is okaaay.... and there are some good items like the fried rice, there really there are better places in the area. I don't think I will be going back a fourth time. I gave Lac Vien a fair chance already."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and it's always super busy at lunch time. The pho (I usually get the chicken and rare beef) and spring rolls are delicious! The best part is that the people who work here are super nice and the place is well maintained as well."}
{"text":"The biggest draw for me here is that it's in the same lot as the Lindt Outlet. Place is clean (even the washroom) with roomy tables and booths. Not too much in the way of decor. 

We Ordered:
- Special Pho with rare beef, beef ball, beef tendon, beef tripe and beef brisket; it was heavy on the sesame oil not too much depth of flavor.
- Thai Shrimp salad with (iceburg) lettuce, tomato, onion, and green and red bell pepper. This was very light not heavy enough for a main salad but would make a good side salad for two people.
- Lemonade soda was potent; I had to let the ice melt a bit to tone it down. If you like sweet and sour drinks, this one is for you.

Service was friendly and food came out quick. I personally wouldn't choose to eat here but it's popular with our friends so I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I came here again with a group of people.  Extremely disappointed with the Beef salad.  The picture on the menu says one thing and when you get it, the beef is a thinly slice piece of jerky.  Like come on.  don't charge me for pieces of lettuce and a half ass piece of meat.  not happy."}
{"text":"I went with this location for a mother-daughter date and although I love chicken pho, I was not very impressed with the overall flavour. 

I understand people cannot handle spices and strong flavours, but I found the broth fairly bland; I added just about everything I had on the table to bring it up a notch. I also didn't find the chicken to be seasoned much. This dish was disappointingly mediocre. 

On the other hand, my mom had pineapple fried rice and loved it. And we shared shrimp and crispy rolls. **The shrimp rolls are definitely worth going back for. 

The atmosphere and service were good. And the food came out fairly quickly as each dish was ready. I would go back out of lack of other known options. And of course, for the shrimp rolls."}
{"text":"Dropped by for an early dinner; the location is clean and organized. 

Food was ok

1. \"pho nam\" (beef tendon), the meat was really chewy we ended up not eating more than a piece each. 

2. Rice with grilled chicken & pork, pork was full of flavor but the chicken was very dry.

Staff are friendly in English but I'm vietnamese...so I heard all the \"comments\" they had to say to each other about anything & everything. Very rude and unprofessional. 

Prob won't come back."}
{"text":"I always pass by Lac Vien when I am driving down to Scarborough Town Centre.

Lac Vien is a small isolated pho restaurant in Scarborough at the Lindor plaza. Walking in on a weekend night, a few tables were occupied, but we were still able to grab seats right away. Their menu comes in three different languages (primarily English with Cantonese and Vietnamese under the English subs). 

The Vietnamese Rice Noodle Soups come in three sizes, the largest bowl being around $11. We decided to try their special bowl to see how hot their soup was, cause that's how I like the pho. Lac Vien's soup wasn't too hot, and became room temperature as I was finishing the bowl. The noodles were alright, it wasn't anything too special in my opinion.

Their Crispy Spring Rolls came in twos are are about $5 for both. This was also average in my opinion - nothing extremely special, but not terrible. I would come visit Lac Vien if I wanted another safe meal to eat."}
{"text":"We were here for the first time after reading decent reviews. The rare beef pho was quite tasteless and not that great. The broth could use some flavoring to make it better. The shrimp appetizer rolls were standard nothing special. 

Service was pretty good though. Friendly services and informative. Locations is spacious inside. We had kids and it wasn't a problem."}
{"text":"Pretty standard quality pho. Serving sizes are huge though.

Even their plain pho for $5 is a good healthy serving.

Service is fast, restaurant is clean, lots of tables. Servers are friendly as well.

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great pho! Most unique broth I've ever had in pho. They also have a Thai beef stew that is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that they had one the most refreshing and punchy spicy pho in town! Beef fresh role is must, if not, feel free to suggest me better-!
Service is also above standard :)

Yeah I know, if you've noticed from other reviews of mine, I'm either love or hate :p"}
{"text":"I came here one day with my brothers because we were craving pho and this place popped up on nearby pho places and I'm so glad it did! Always a positive experience and fills you up comfortably. My favourites is the seafood and beef brisket pho. They do the noodles a little differently but they're easier to grab in my opinion. The drive is a little longer but it's worth it, By far my favourite pho place to go to!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family a few days ago for a weekday dinner and we'll be coming back to this place for sure. 

The service was great, probably because the restaurant was far from full, but the servers were still very friendly. Food came very quickly. 

The food was pretty good as well. We ordered many things, such as the spring rolls, pad Thai, and pho. The pho was nothing special here but the rest of the food was above average in comparison to other Asian restaurants I've been to. Prices were average. 

Our local asian restaurants all have the similar food an prices but lack the service and are often crowded, so I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Always good service .. my brother and normally get the pork cop with fried egg then split a large p1 and if we are really hungry the mango salad with shrimp .. free wifi is a bonus"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this great neighbourhood restaurant.  My girlfriend and I have been here 4 times over the last couple of months.  The service is fast, food is tasty, and the prices are great."}
{"text":"I regret that for the past 8 years, I've been driving by this place everyday to and from work and not taken advantage of their delicious Pho soup! If you have a sinus cold, be sure to bring extra Kleenex! The Soup is sure to open your passages!

{"text":"Just another run-of-the-mill viet restaurant. Their pho dishes are served with dry noodles, which I personally prefer. Their drinks are served in take-out cups, so even if you don't finish, you can take it to go with you. Service here is fast, if you're looking for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Felt a little under the weather and wanted to comfort the body with more than just neti pots, vitamins, and rest. The hotel staff recommended Lac Vien for pho and away I went.

The place is no frills and has a staff of ladies flying around to get you what you order. Pho has three sizes of noodles you can order - otherwise they come with the standard trimmings of basil, bean sprouts, limes, and chili.

The broth was solid although I would have preferred a thinner noodle than what they provided. Pho (large), goi cuon, viet coffee and tip ran just shy of $20. Seems like a lot, but then again, I tend to eat more than I should. Helped me go back to sleep and sleep off the cold. Bueno."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times before and I like this place. 

The food here is really good and it's upscale comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. A plus to the restaurant is that they have to option for either cold green tea or hot green tea. 
one of my favorite dishes is the Cambodian rice noodles, although mainly Vietnamese they offer a wide variety of Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese dishes. My last visit here I had the Pad Thai. The flavor true to authenticity, and full of flavor.

The set up like I said is upscale and the service is quick.

I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best. The pho had a really sweet taste. The rice and grilled chicken plate was ok, but the egg omelette seemed to be old as it was dried out. Overall, I would probably not come back as there alot of better pho restaurants out there.

Also we didn't get any water/ tea until the end of the meal even after we asked.

On the plus side the servers were nice and the food came out in a timely matter."}
{"text":"I definitely categorize Lac Vien as a hidden gem in the Dufferin/401 area.  

Nestled deep in a hidden area that's surrounded by industrial complexes, you would never know this place existed to the average folk.  Unless, you work in the area or you find yourself lost driving around the side streets to avoid the heavy traffic on Dufferin/401.

I discovered this place through a friend who loves Vietnamese food.  He frequents Yorkdale mall with his wife and somehow found this place one day.  He strongly recommended it as they excel at their vermicelli dishes.

And he is right!  Absolutely the best grilled pork vermicelli in the city if not this side of Toronto.  Very flavorful, deeply marinated pork grilled to perfection. This is my favourite item to get. I also customize it by getting it with the deep fried spring rolls, grilled pork balls and grilled shrimp paste on sugar cane.  

They also do a decent bowl of pho, that famous Vietnamese beef noodle soup.  Fair caution though, that they use the slightly thicker noodle and not the thin noodle that I like and I am used to.  Being Vietnamese myself, I can sense this place is more of a North Vietnam influenced as they also have \"bun cha\" on the menu, a dish rarely if ever found at other Vietnamese restaurants that are owned by Southern Vietnamese folks.

Service is good, the staff speaks fluent Vietnamese accented English.  In the evenings the area is dark, shady even as there are barely any streetlights. But don't be discouraged, Lac Vien is definitely worth trying at least once or twice, especially if you want to get away from the crowded food court at Yorkdale Mall nearby."}
{"text":"A good alternative to mekong (other good etobicoke pho). 
Sometimes I get a headache afterwards (MSG?). 
Chicken soup is very good!"}
{"text":"Great food always fresh , the pho is great try H4 it's is amazing as is there house special pho.
The service is very friendly always greet with a smile .
Nice atmosphere and very well kept and clean .
Highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Their soups are full of flavour.  Love their Tom Yum.  Cold rolls and spring rolls are as good as they get.  Very delicious food.  
General Tso a little to on the sweet saucy side.  But it's not a real asian dish anyway.  It's candy food for North Americans to make them think they are eating Asian food.  
Let's face it people.  Anything breaded and smothered in a \"candy\" glaze is not Asian!  
It's basically a candy apple with chicken instead of apple. 
Excellent pad Thai."}
{"text":"I always come for the H4 dish.  The beef they use in this Thai Beef Noodle soup is very flavourful.  They give generous amounts too.   It doesn't have the carrots like other places.  But still flavourful.  My only complaint is that it's never served hot enough.  Especially after putting in all the garnishments.  The interior is very nice and relaxed.  I like sitting at the booths."}
{"text":"This place has unique soups. I like the consistent service and quality. It's bright and clean here.  Bubble tea isn't bad either."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try out their original location in Scarberia but somehow I just keep missing the train on that one. Anyhow, I am glad to see that they have made their way west but there's stiff competition out here so hopefully they've brought their A game. I usually judge most if not all Vietnamese restaurants by their pho (a very typical dish that dominates most Vietnamese eateries in our city). As I pulled into the building, it brought back a lot of great memories of awesome evenings with my buddies catching the game at the old Beaver & Bulldog pub -- and their amazing wings!

Anyhow, let's get down to it. The broth is hot, clean and flavourful with hints of herbs and spices. The portions are very large and prices are on the low side compared to most. The beef is one up from the standard frozen stuff but it's nothing to rave about; decent quality nonetheless. This is a good bowl of pho, one that is slightly above average but it's the value that definitely pushes me to recommend this place.

The space is also very clean, bright and airy with lots of parking in the back. The service is adequate and they are usually not too busy. I would say this is a good addition to the neighbourhood as there are not too many pho restaurants in the nearby vicinity."}
{"text":"2nd time here, and the pho and soup noodles have been on point each and every time. They don't skimp out on ingredients, and it's all very fresh. Had also H2 last time and then H6 this time, and both were very flavourful. The tofu in the fresh roll was really fresh and crispy, but the shrimp fresh roll wasn't as good. The shrimp in those rolls didn't seem fresh. Definitely will be back to try the bun and rice dishes. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Lac Vien opened up not too long ago and we've been visiting it at lunch time as our local pho restaurant.  The service is great, the food isn't bad and it's relatively easy to get to.

First note is that the pho is wet style rice noodles, so it's a bit different.  I proceeded to order the fresh shrimp rolls and a special pho.

The shrimp rolls aren't the best.  I think they really lack flavour, it's just shrimp, lettuce and bun noodles so it wasn't really popping full of flavour.  The dip was really heavy in peanuts so it almost tasted like peanut butter.  Not really a fan of the shrimp rolls all together.

The pho was pretty good.  One thing I was really impressed about was the quality of the beef slices.  It's not low grade random shavings like you see at other places.  It's actually got something to it which is refreshing.  I think the brisket is way too thick and not really tender, so next time I'd probably avoid ordering pho with the brisket.

All in all, Lac Vien is probably the best pho place around the area.  If  you come when it's hot, they also serve you iced tea which is a bonus!  Who wants hot tea on a hot day anyways..."}
{"text":"This has become a go-to spot for lunch, due to its proximity to my office and their quick service, not to mention their good food. Portions are quite decent for the counter service items, so I sometimes have two meals out of a single order. I usually order off the menu unless I'm in a hurry, so I've only had the counter service a few times. 

The Pho is good, although the broth is not as flavourful as other places I've gone to. My favourite dish so far is the lemongrass chicken with rice, but I'm slowly working my way through the menu to try lots of different dishes. I had the chicken in red curry on my last visit and it was really good."}
{"text":"Not a bad location but also not one I would really come back to.
I ordered the bun, vermicelli, and it was really salty. The noodles were chewy and there were a lot more veggies than anything else. The spring rolls were also not my favorite. It was all just okay.

I also grabbed a coconut shake. Most Viet places use real coconut and coconut water, but they use very heavy powder base.. I really didn't like how artificial it tasted.

Service was okay. It took us quite a while to even be greeted even though all of the staff saw is standing by the door. It was definitely not busy at all.. 

Over all it's not horrible but I have better places in mind to go for Viet"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one by my job in Scarborough, but saw this one while I was in Mississauga and just came in to grab a quick bite to eat. Ordered the Pad Thai. It was really good until I bit into a piece of glass that was in my food. When I pulled the glass out of my mouth, it also cut my finger.

When I called the waiter over to let him know, and he saw my bloody napkin and the piece of glass, all he asked me was if the food was ok. It took me explaining it twice in detail for him to understand.

I'm heading home now hoping I did not unknowingly digest any other pieces of glass. Wish me luck, and I recommend you do a through investigation of your food if you eat here."}
{"text":"ordered a large pho(house special), got a couple of meat and no tendons. it supposed to have all the meat in it. plus the service is slow.  waited 40mins for the fried chicken wing. im currently writing this review while waiting for the chicken. not going to come back again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.
They have a lunch special which is ready by 11:30am that's always hot.
The staff are very friendly and helpful.
There menu is large and they don't take long to cook.

I have never eaten in store so I don't know how the service is.

Over all great place for lunch since I work around the area and want more for my buck"}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant that was very busy for a late lunch crowd. Had to wait a bit for my Pho which is strange because other places have you in and out in minutes. As for the Pho, nice clean tasting broth...the star anise can be smelled and tasted in the soup. I like the noodles they selected because it had a nice texture. Spring rolls were okay but had better. Don't know why the ratings are low because this is a above average pho place."}
{"text":"Total review 3.5 stars, very good score. 

In short, this is a quality place with lots of parking in an area that's near a lot of other stuff if your in South Markham / north est Scarborough. Good atmosphere, nice finishes in restaurant and good pricing. 

Atmosphere 

It's clear that this place used to be an AYCE Sushi place and prior to that used to be a chain restaurant like a Harvey's that had a drive through window. This place though takes that all over and makes it look nice with the nice if finishes on the inside with lots of room and tables for all. Very clean looking and bathrooms were clean. 

Menu/staff

Expansive but standard menu of a pho/Vietnamese place that'll offer similar dishes like Thai and Chinese stuff. I believe the people who served me were  Vietnamese too so that's a plus. Very friendly and accommodating to a family with a small child, especially when the child was crying her face off. 

Food

Given that it had pho in the name, I had to order their house special pho which is the one with all the types of beef, rare beef, steak, tripe, beef balls, and tendon. However as we all know pho is about the broth, and this broth was good. Clear, deep flavour, the right amount of spices and seasonings. I always add the basil lime and a bit of chili paste to give it the flavour I want but it was delicious and just what I was craving. They use vermicelli noodles and not the thin rice noodles and that was fine. 

Lots of meat in there. 

$7 for a small, $8.25 for a large, $10.25 for extra large. Had the large and that was plenty. That's a medium at most places too. Great value for money and good place to go after a Costco run or something like that. 

Would go again."}
{"text":"Don't go here  they are so rude to clients I made order from the menu dn2 witch is shrimp and they bring d2 witch is coffee and I told them wrong order they still want to charge me for the coffee witch I find so rude and also ask me for tips 
Pho was ok but bad service"}
{"text":"This place is close to home and so, has become one of my go to spots when in need of great food. 

Location: situated at the corner of Caledonia and Cartwright in the middle of little traffic. However, this place always seems to get customers from near and far. 

Service: even though their English sometimes isn't the best, their promptness on delivering the food in no time makes up for it. 
Staff is nice, usually smiley and keeping busy attending to customers. 



Food: delicious!! Really well made and you have a variety to choose from. The restaurant is Vietnamese however you do get Thai options in the menu to spice it up. For spicy lovers you will enjoy this. Portions are a good size. 
I usually get either the Pad Thai, or the Vermicelli with grilled beef and a spring roll. 
I could never finish the pad Thai it's a big portion for me, which is great for left overs. The rice with chicken, beef and an egg is also a great option. Seasoned really well and it comes with a small soup on the side. 

All in all this place is a great Vietnamese place, nice staff, great good, decent prices. I have introduced this place to numerous people and they love it to. 

Ps there is room for free parking as well. 
Bonus! 
Sorry no pictures yet as I usually go to this place when I'm really hungry after work so I always start eating before I remember to take pics"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times but was never in the mood for Vietnamese food before now. I was greeted and seated immediately upon entering, even though they were very busy. The restaurant is clean and spacious. Nice.

I ordered grilled beef with spring roll and vermicelli and it didn't take long for the food to show up. It was a good-sized portion, looked good, and tasted good. A very pleasing meal. The dishes being served at surrounding tables also looked very good.

The service was efficient, with all the staff moving around the dining room at a good pace but they could have been a little friendlier. It wasn't bad but the experience could have been a little better."}
{"text":"Very busy here during lunch time, but the food is good. It's authentic Vietnamese food. Everything seems on point when it comes to the flavour of the food. The service is good also. The washrooms are clean. I love this place and come here too much!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for supper.  Looks like it used to be a fast food restuarant across from McDonald's.  Had the seafood soup and grilled chicken and pork chop with rice.  Both were quite good and reasonably priced...total bill for 2 was under $24 including tip and Chinese tea.  Would recommend to all and would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yelp needs a .5 star option! This is ideally 3.5 rated. 

The decor nice, quaint, decent service nothing exceptional. 

Started with the fresh spring rolls, I've had better. Nothing Exceptional. But the sauce with it was too heavy to be used for dipping. 
The stir fry beef was excellent. Good quantity as well. The pad Thai though left something to be desired. For one even after asking for extra spices I barely got any. It was mild. The noodles had a nice taste but as with the chicken, both nicish but just didn't feel complete. Some flavour was missing. It's not authentic maybe that's the missing piece?

Still enjoyed the food, would go back an try something else!"}
{"text":"Good pho
Great price
Fast service

Love the extra large option which is great for the big eaters out there. I though my bowl was a bit lacking in the meat department. I dug deep down into the bowl but couldn't find any extra slices of beef. 

The spring rolls are really huge ($3.99) and one order is enough for 2 people. Don't make the same mistake I made. I though they would be like the ones at Pho 88 where the spring rolls are smaller. The spring rolls themselves tasted good but they were drenched in oil. Yes they are deep fried and oil is expected but there was enough oil to fill a shot glass from the plate of spring rolls. Dipping sauce was also lacking in flavor and it seemed like I was dipping it in water. 

Drink selections are good and they have the standard milk shakes like other pho joints but this time I decided to copy Jennifer K. and get the ice coffee condensed milk ($3.50). It had a strong coffee taste and wasn't overly sweet. 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Lac Vien has a large interior and was completely empty at around 5 pm, but got progressively busier. The service was quick and reserved, but polite. 

I was impressed by the sheer amount of food that they gave us - huge bowls of Pho and Vermicelli with chicken that I couldn't even finish. The vegetarian spring rolls were probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The broth was light and clear, not too salty but still flavourful. No choice was given for fresh or dry noodle options, but their noodle was sort of in between the two in terms of thickness. The extra large pho came with a generous amount of noodles, which was a plus and a rarity nowadays but the sliced beef could have been sliced of thinner. Overall, I would definitely come back if I was in the area"}
{"text":"great pho... I've tried pho at many different restaurants this was one of the best for sure. it's open pretty late too so it's great for late night meals"}
{"text":"I've always gone to this place for pho as my mom works nearby. The staff is good and never experience any sort of wait time. The food is flavorful as you come to expect for Vietnamese cuisine. The prices are a bit high compared to other pho places but the atmosphere is inviting and peaceful. The only thing I can say is bad is the placement as the parking there is horrendous. Overall pretty good food and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Pho and more pho. I know this is not fine dining in any capacity, but for a quick lunch it serves a great pho. One of the cleaner pho restaurants I have been to. They have a hot take out Asian food section which a lot of people come and grab food.  They also do a chicken broth option.  Typical 100+ item menu that you can go dizzy looking at it. 

If you work in the area I am sure you come here. I've been here twice now and I can say the food is consistently good. Very reasonable for a large bowl for under $10. 

Local gem, must try if you like or never even had pho."}
{"text":"It was okay. I kind of felt the food was a fusion. I mean there's Thai food too. Pad Thai was too sweet to my likings. The spring roll was just cabbage basically. What can I expect for viet food in Toronto. I am determined to find some authenticity here!"}
{"text":"I went with my family to this restaurant.  The location is clean, and well kept. The staff is very friendly. This place charges \"10% more\" than cheaper pho places - but for the cleanliness and atmosphere as well as service its well worth it. 

When we sat down we were served complimentary Jasmine Tea. We ordered our usual, pho chin nam and vietnamese coffee. Taste is pretty standard and not too salty. This place isn't too fancy but also not the best that I've had. Worth a trip to and would visit again."}
{"text":"Parking: Free - Small parking lot.

Venue: Medium size, can bring a group of 4-6 or so to a table.

Washrooms: Small. Stall and a few urinals.

Experience: I've only been here once. Tried the Pho (vegetarian one). It was pretty good, but nothing special. I've been to many Pho restaurants, and even make Pho at home, so I have a lot to compare too.

Good to bring a date, place was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"I've been to the other 2 locations and they have always been a good experience this scarborough location does not live up to the franchise.

I ordered a chicken on rice and it was RAW, i asked staff if they could cook it a little longer and they refused arguing that my rubbery raw chicken was fully cooked.  I then asked if they could just microwave it and again it was denied I dont know why they would feel the need to argue with customers.

mistakes happen in the restaurant business all the time, but there is no excuse for arguing with a customer, specially over a piece of chicken that was visually raw."}
{"text":"The price is definitely one of the highest in comparison to other Viet restaurants...but it deserves to be because the quality is much higher too. I haven't actually tried their pho yet though. I ordered the diced beef on rice and it was delicious and filling. The fried spring rolls look didn't impress me, but their taste did. Also, the presentation of the meals and the decor is definitely something other Viet places need to take note of."}
{"text":"Decor is good. No napkins at tables. Accepts Visa/MasterCard. Clean washroom.

I ordered ph ?c bit (P1), service was fast, came in 11 am though.

The toppings were slightly overlooked, broth was okay, little bit blander compared to pho places nearby.

Overall good."}
{"text":"Been going here since the place opened... great food and great proce...service is a little abrupt but not a bad place"}
{"text":"Went here for vermicelli and was not impressed. Noodles were too warm, a lot of the grilled pork was burnt and tasted too much of charcoal, sausage was dry and spring roll tasted funny. It's sad when the tea tastes better than the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time: pho with beef, tendon, and tripe. Second time: house special (rare beef, brisket, tendon, balls). Soup tastes good, but there are better. Pho noodles themselves were different sizes both times. Also, they were clumpy the second time. The rare beef wasn't rare. They give mostly noodles. Two measly-sized beef balls perhaps the size of a quarter. The staff is nice, and the place is clean though. Price is okay, there are cheaper as well. Pho Dau Bo by Weston and Finch is still my #1."}
{"text":"I like the food here but the chow mein sucks.. it couldve been better plating and sauce."}
{"text":"Fancy pho, is what I call this place . Not the average! I actually love the atmosphere and ambience of this restaurant! The food is delicious and the portions are big :) come hungry !!! You will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Best pho restaurant in Scarborough area hands down. I drive an extra 15 mins from Markham just to have pho at this place. Getting the original pho with tripe is your way to go. The prices are reasonable and there are less people there most of the time, so you can chat with your friends without the feeling of being rushed because someone is waiting for your table. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is that they give you ONE thin little napkin per person. However, thats an easy fix (ask for more napkins). This is my go-to pho restaurant when I drive down Markham Road."}
{"text":"My first time trying Phõ and i loved it!! Me and my boyfriend decided to check out this place last week. We came across it while driving by. I coudnt resist the huge black and green border that said PHO. I was actually looking for a pho place close to home. I know i hadn't tried it  yet but i've had ramen many times before and its the bomb!! so i thought it would be similar? 

Wrong. Not that its bad. Its just different...in its own sorta way. I ordered a large bowl of the  Phõ Ga saté which is a chicken noodle sort of pho with a kick of spice. ( keep in mind there are 3 sizes of pho to chose from; small, large and XL) We also ordered a side of fresh chicken rolls with vermecilli and mixed vegetables. Which i particularily enjoyed with that sauce they give you, but my bf wasnt too huge a fan of. 

The pho arrived and it looked oh so yummy! Still pipin' hot and ready to be eaten. The bowl was hugee. I couldnt even finish it...i suggest you order a large only if you havn't practically eaten the whole day -or unless you normally have a big appetite. 

My bf was done way ahead of me and he finshed up my bowl which i no longer couldn't finish( which i tend to do a lot).  I tried his bowl too and i can say hands down my broth was more flavourful. He had the pho house special. But i guess people all have their own ideal taste of their perfect bowl of pho. 

Overall 'd come here again- the place is clean, and the waitresses are super sweet. Plus the food is delish. Need i say more? 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time here. I know it used to be a Greek fast food restaurant but a nice change in the area. Especially there are a lot of businesses around here for clients to meet up. Ordered the pho special, as most of the pho places do have their own types, and shared a deep fried spring roll. Impression? Very nice but little quantity of meat and food I as reading from the previous reviews but it was a satisfying meal. Will come by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time today. Broth was ok. Ordered the rare beef pho but the beef wasn't rare. It was cooked. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Here's another I-dined-here-and-didn't-write-a-review-until-now episode. Yikes!

My rating is 3.5 stars.

I first noticed this restaurant on a sunny, cold wintery Sunday. I had visited the Lindt chocolate outlet close by and was hungry. I didn't feel like McDonald's. I wasn't on Yelp at the time, so my visit must have been in early 2014.

The restaurant had just opened up. I was promptly greeted and seated at one of the booths. I got a menu and ordered my usual, rare beef and beef ball pho. I remember enjoying it. It was good. It wasn't to the point where I was craving it upon my return to this establishment. I did come back, though.

The last time I was here was a while ago. I did indeed sample other goodies on the menu. I had the grilled chicken rolls with hoisin dipping sauce. They were fresh and tasty.

I then had the grilled beef vermicelli with shrimp on a sugar cane. I was content. It was flavourful and yummy. The portion size was perfect.

It's a family-run business. It does get busy at dinner time. However, if you come a bit earlier, you are just fine.

I need to return. I have been away for far too long.

{"text":"I have been here a few times and the service here is awesome. The staff are really nice and friendly, always greet you when you come in and leave. 
Food is great too. I think it's one of the best pho places in Mississauga. Also highly recommend their rice dishes. 
One huge plus is that you don't smell like pho after you leave the restaurant. Nice interior compare to other Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been going to Lac Vien for a couple of years now. It's quite a large restaurant and there are always plenty of staff on hand to serve, so there's never a big wait time for seating or service.

The menu is pretty extensive, although one thing my husband always misses from this menu is the see through (glass) noodles. 

They have several Thai dishes as well as Vietnamese on the menu and although I haven't ordered the mango salad, I've seen it served and it looks amazing (will have to try that and update my review later).

The soups here are pretty good, although I'd have to say the broth is never quite as rich as at some other Vietnamese restaurants. On our last visit, I tried the saté beef soup and it wasn't bad. Just not the best I've had. I feel the same about the Thai beef noodle stew. Not bad, just not the best I've had.

The vermicelli dishes aren't bad, but the shrimp on a sugarcane isn't great. It's a little dried out. They also use wheat wrappers on their spring rolls, rather than the traditional rice wrappers. 

Our son has had the pad Thai a couple of times and says he'd give it a 7 out of 10.

A couple of things we've ordered that we've enjoyed quite a bit are the chicken curry (nice and rich with a fair amount of coconut milk) and the coconut shake.

The interior is 'fancier' than most Vietnamese restaurants in the area, which is nice and it always seems clean.

I feel like my overall feeling about this place is that it's between a 3 and 3.5 out of 5. I've never had a bad experience and the food has always been pretty good, but it's never been outstanding either."}
{"text":"I'm a littleee sad that this restaurant isn't my place anymore.  There are several reasons why.

1. The pho here is 800% tasteless.  If I have to use more than a shake of salt and pepper (in this case it was like I used 50 shakes) then the taste just isn't there.
2. You know when you make soup at home and the fat bubbles up and it sticks to the rim of the bowl?  You'd scoop it out so your soup doesn't dissolve into a bowl of fat.  For some reason Lac Vien didn't take out the fat bubbles and I wasn't able to remove them as they were already dissolving @_@
3. The beef they used wasn't fresh - you can tell when it's really really chewy that it's been deep freezed for a long time 
4. The chicken and porkchop rice my boyfriend got was a huge negative.  The meat tasted like it was slapped onto a grill and cooked.  That's it - there were no flavours besides smoke.

I usually don't mind spending $$$ on food especially if it was good.  & when I do feel terrible about spending $ on a place - then I don't go back.  
Time to find another pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food was never one of the Asian cuisines that made me crave it as I found previous restaurants just being 'ok' in terms of flavour.  It's often cheap, fast, but great or memorable? Rarely.  I was drawn here by the number of 5 star reviews from people who share similar taste buds.  Could it be that there is a Vietnamese restaurant that provides stellar service AND tastes?  

I arrived to this spot on Dundas and it's quite a cute looking place.  It has an unique look and feel that makes it stand out among the boxy and aged commercial strip malls nearby.  It looks like it has a great patio as well... considering it's dead in the winter, it's not in use but it can be a great place for the summer time.  We walked in and we were immediately greeted with a smile and a sweeping hand gesture to take a table.  Bonus points for being attentive even when they're serving other guests!

The  menu is structured like most Vietnamese places... you have your pho, rice plates with various meats, your Chinese influenced dishes (fried rice or noodles), huge number of fruit base shakes, and several grilled meat options.  Our group of three goes for some hearty soups as we're still trying to defrost from the Canadian winter. Our order goes smoothly and repeated back to us without missing a beat.  

The first thing to arrive is the mango shake... It's sooo good. It's thick, luscious, and reminds me of eating mango fresh off the tree in Thailand.  I'm sure it has a good dose of sugar in there too but I'm happy and content.  Our noodles come piping hot and with a good dose of basil, and various other leafy goodness to adjust the flavour of our soups.  I add the chilli and all the green items in and take a sip.  Ok... this broth had FLAVOUR!  It wasn't some hot oily water that was masquerading as broth.  I'm not sure if they used beef, pork, or chicken bones or a combination to create the flavour but it was seriously good.  My friend had the 'kitchen sink meat combination'  and it was chock full.  She must have had at least 4 pieces of everything in there.  There was no shortage of the good stuff instead of rice noodle filler.

The price is so reasonable for this hearty soupy affair and it definitely stands out as one of the best (if not the best) Vietnamese options in Mississauga.  I'll definitely return to try other dishes such as their grilled meats."}
{"text":"the best place for pho and all there dishes are incredible...ignore anyone who says differently this place is the best...its like better then vietnam itself"}
{"text":"Been here everytime I come to Toronto for training. My coworkers love it too. Location is kinda odd but again, it's the food that makes it. Pho here is great with a huge portion and a decent price. The veggie spring rolls are pretty good too. I've only had the pad thai once which wasn't bad as well. Quick service, reasonably polite staff, great food and awesome prices. If you need a bit of a jolt in the morning/afternoon, the Viet coffee is a great pick too."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I used to like this place for their Pho, but tonight has given me doubts about coming back again.

My go-to at any Vietnamese restaurant is the Pho Tai Nam and the quality of meat was what ruined it for me. The fatty meat, to me, is the best part (fat equals flavour) and biting into it here at Lac Vien felt like when a non-asian played the star role of Dragonball: Evolution -- a huge disappointment. It was crunchy... almost like the texture of cartilage... Not what you want in a bowl of Pho...

Speaking of DBZ, the spring rolls are full of filler too.

The soup was the only thing that was decent. Sure, you can argue that the soup is a good chunk of what makes a good Pho, but the soup can only do so much.

There's a particular review here on Yelp that's sealed the deal on whether or not I come back again though...

It's a floater."}
{"text":"I've been here twice just for convenience and a quick lunch. There's ample parking and seems like a popular spot for lunch. For food, I got the pho house special and found the broth to be very weak. I usually never add condiments to my broth as I like to savour the taste of the natural sweetness from the long simmered meat but I had to add hoisin sauce to this. My boyfriend got the rice dish and everything was over done. The fried egg yolk was not runny, the meat was a bit burnt. There was a lot of servers around and they were quick to fill our water but when we asked for something they would never remember to bring it. They were quick to serve but slow to deliver. Would probably not return as there are more authentic pho places which I'm willing to travel the distance for."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in town!

Good food - Tried some dishes and everything tastes super authentic. It's the one of the rare places that make the best Phrom Penh noodle that tastes exactly in Vietnam. My favorite! 

The restaurant is also very clean which is a big bonus. It's one of the rare places that doesn't have sticky tables.  

Service is standard. Food came out quick and nicely placed. 

Five stars for everything!"}
{"text":"My mom was raving about this place. She claims that this is the best place for pho compared to the others that we generally visit. After trying their House Special, I cannot agree that it is the best. 

The House Special comes with pretty much everything; beef balls, tripe, tendon and rare beef. The noodles were a bit thicker than traditional pho noodles however, very tender. What makes pho tasty is of course the broth. The flavour in the broth fell short... I had to take a couple of sips prior to making this verdict. The broth tasted like hot water with a tint of pork essence and soy sauce. It does not capture that meaty essence that you'd normally expect from eating a good bowl of pho. During the whole meal I had to add condiments (e.g. hoison /seafood sauce, hot sauce and chili sauce) to it in order to make it a bit more tasty. 

Servers were friendly and warm and service was prompt. However, be mindful of the item they call out when it arrives because two people who served us called out the wrong order. When I asked for clarification on whether it was the House Special she said yes but, it turned out to be the Beef Ball Rice Noodles. Another server brought over another bowl of noodles in which she claimed it to be the Beef Ball Rice Noddles however, it turneds out to be the House Special. 

Overall, I am not a fan of their pho. If they can capture that meaty essence in their broth then it would be one of the best phos out there. Moreover, I would like to go back and try out their vermicelli and rice dishes."}
{"text":"Just an average pho place. Service was speedy, staff was friendly but food was ok & filling. I had the wonton noodle soup (egg noodle, shrimp/ pork wontons & mixed veggies). The stock was alright and wontons were underwhelming plus the veggies were a bit excessive. I also split a spring roll with my friend and it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Lac Vien just kind of popped up suddenly in the middle of no where. 

Located in a plaza where Subway and McDonalds rules (the lunch choices for people working in the area) and Lac Vien is a welcome additional in this neighbourhood.

The interior is clean, spacious and open. A lot of windows seating that overlooking Markham Road that traffic zooming along way above the speed limit. Music is \"romantic\" and \"loud\" with the dial set at Sirius XM  Love.

Pho House Special Large ($7.50) is one of the better ones in Scarborough area as the broth has a nice aroma of herbs and the beef quality was good (the beef brisket was so tender even with its thicker cut!). The soup itself though can be a little hotter maybe I should request that next time?

Iced Coffee with Condensed Milk ($3.50) is made not from the traditional metal French drip filter but from a BVB coffee machine. A perfect \"dessert\" drink for me though.

Service was fast and polite! 

Lac Vien definitely a good Vietnamese restaurant if you have some cravings for Vietnamese food. They serves more than Pho! I think I will be back to try their Phnom Penh Noodles next time!"}
{"text":"We came here again ordered the same dishes. Quality if the buhn was much better. All the veggies and peanuts were there. This place is good. Could be our go to pho spot."}
{"text":"The out decor made us think it's a fancy French restaurant. The indoor was just normal restaurant. The food were okay. My crispy seafood noodle was good, pad Thai was okay."}
{"text":"I had the Pho house special and was disappointed. I live in the west end of North York where we have an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants so I'm spoiled when it comes to good Viet food. The broth tasted different, dare I say it tasted like a bowl of instant noodles? The noodles itself was a bit too soft for me.  Unfortunately I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here when they first opened and I'd have to say they are consistent with their food quality and presentation. I was going to change it up and get the seafood vermicelli soup but decided to play it safe. I ended up getting P1 (pho dac biet).

There were 6 of us and we all got our orders at the same time and it also came out quick. Everyone's broth was clear and savoury. I like the type of pho noodles they use. It's a bit thicker than the usual places but still thin. I was impressed by how large the garnishes were. All of the garnishes looked clean and fresh.

I thought the large size would be too big for me but I was able to finish. I'm assuming the small size would be more suitable for kids."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful. Fast service in a clean restaurant. You get what you pay for here, but it is enjoyable and tasty."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went there for my hubby's bday. The food is absolutely tasteless. No salt, had to use quite few salt shakes to make the food edible. The food didnt look fresh, it was pre made. Portion size was decent, but what is the point when the food is tasteless.Ordered the Veg Spring Rolls, Chicken Rolls, Strawberry bubble tea, Mango bubble tea-way too sweet-even mentioned to the waitress-she didn't bother  to replace it. I ordered the Thai Fried Rice and Hubby ordered the Vermicelli with grilled chicken. Definitely not going back."}
