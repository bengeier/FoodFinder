{"text":"Hole in the wall. Best deals of halal pizza in Scarborough. Family run since its start. Brother and nephew run the place now. Great pizza. Delicious wings. Interior is terrible and needs a major remodel. No seating. But bang for the buck best pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Ajmz took me here after booooosting this place like no tomorrow... all for good reason though. Though there are like 5 different pizza spots within 5km of this one, this one is definitely the best. Their slices are large, and extremely affordable ($1.75/slice). The pizza itself is thin crust, not too saucy and, after being warmed up, cheesy. Their pizzas are one of thoooose that taste good warm, or cold even. Though there isn't much room to sit, I'd still put 'em in my top 5. Top 5. Top 5."}
{"text":"I was craving ground beef Pizza, so I randomly tried out this spot because it's halal.  The price was very good. The restaurant is very simple. Just a walk in basically.   They also had pre-prepared wedges, fried fish, barbecue chicken, and fried chicken on deck ready to go. The pizza style is like thin crust New York Pizza.  The worker told me once I try their pizza I will never go anywhere else again. Okay ....they may be right!  At a price like that and an amazing flavor, I am ready to return.   Note that for $6.99 you can get a medium pizza with 0-3 toppings."}
