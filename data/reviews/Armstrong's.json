{"text":"I use to LOVE Armstrong's.  I had been going there since they opened, even driving from the north hills to have dinner there.  Some where along the way, in the last few years, Armstrong's has lost its way.  The last few times I went there, the food was not good, but the most disappointing was the service.  Terrible.  The main reason I always like going there was the fast and reliable server and bartender.  I waited long for her to greet us, close to fifteen minutes-almost left.  Then she never came back to ask if I wanted another drink and brought the bill. A shame, because I'm a huge tipper, 25-30% - I use to be a server.  I sadly will never go back, it seems that they aren't hurting for business because there really isn't any competition close by, and people who live by just remember the way it use to be and the servers are nice to their regulars."}
{"text":"A recent experience at another restaurant motivated me to review Armstrong's. We order from here at work every so often. Huge portions, good prices, the food is always good. In years, we have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Armstrong's for many, many years (ok so there was that dark period of time when Armstrong's moved out for a few years and it became Calabria's and then Gullifty's).  My parents lived right up the street from Caste Village and we would find ourselves at Armstrong's, or ordering off the takeout menu, at least once every other week (the ladies who work at the counter still greet my father by name).  Nowadays when I go there I wince at how expensive everything on their menu has become, how packed it is (there's rarely ever a time when you won't have to wait at least 25 minutes for a table on any night of the week), and how slow the service can be.  All of my gripes usually disappear with the arrival of my meal.   Their menu features a wide array of salads, pastas, calzones, traditional Italian dishes, and scrod cooked in more ways than you would ever imagine.  Last night I ordered the eggplant parm, which had crispy eggplants rounds smothered in marinara and cheese.  My dad ordered some kind of hot sausage that was baked in a casserole dish with linguine, marinara sauce and cheese.  Basically, this place excels at smothering things with sauce and cheese.  It's a favorite of the locals and definitely a must try if you are in the area.  Just be prepared for the place to be packed, and try remember as you're standing there with your stomach growling that crowds of people at a restaurant usually means it's good!"}
{"text":"By far the most overrated diner I have ever been in. Poor service and luke warm food are always a step in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Straightforward, good food and drink.  Great staff.   Big portions.   One complaint:  they don't consistently serve green vegetables as an option for sides.  (Sides are:  pasta and potatoes, and more pasta and potatoes.)  I really wish someone could convince management to consistently offer at least one green vegetable as a side each night for those of us who aren't carb-loading/training for a marathon."}
{"text":"Omg - how do people eat so much. The portions are huge. I had the Cajun Chicken and it was the best sandwich ever! Great service - super friendly."}
{"text":"Been going to Armstrong's for 30 plus years ever since they had about 10 tables in the back of a bar on Mt Washington. The food is great portions very large . Most dishes can be shared by 2 people with no one leaving hungry. Prices seem high but for the amount of food you get they are not. Weekends they are very busy so try to go on a weeknight never had to wait doing this. Wait staff is good and ready to suggest something if you can't make up your and."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Romano. Found hair in it. Took 25 minutes to get a new one and restaurant was really slow. Armstrong's seems to be going down hill. Been a customer here for years and it's not what it used to be."}
{"text":"One of my Favorites in Pittsburgh.  The pasta and salads are excellent, the baked ziti is my favorite.  Service can be a little sketchy at times, but other than that, love this place."}
{"text":"I recommend coming for lunch for a sandwich.  Portions are good here.  There are two types of food on the menu; reasonably priced big sandwiches, or overpriced big portioned dinners."}
{"text":"When you walk in you will not be overwhelmed with the decor, but we were greeted by a manager and seated promptly.  The bar is inviting.  There is a lot to choose from and if my stromboli is any indication, you get a ton of food.  The prices may not seem to match at first but when you see the size of the portions it all makes perfect sense.  There is no reason to ever leave here unsatisfied.    The stromboli was great too."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is popular but I had the worst meal out of the year here in Dec.29th! The food was mediocre at best and the service was horrible! We will not return!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  This is our go-to dish for holidays, parties, and it's what we order to deliver to a grieving family instead of funeral flowers.  Reheats well and is absolutely delicious. It's a dish you'll crave."}
{"text":"DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MENU POSTED!! We WERE loyal customers who ordered from here often. We used the menu posted on here, as always, and when we went to pay it was DOUBLE THE COST!! They did not seem to concerned by this and told us we had an old menu. When complained and spoke to the manager explaining we were loyal customers and the mistake they did not care at all. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"A lot of people in the area rave about this place. I think it is just okay. Decor is dated. Food is decent. Nothing super special. Prices are reasonable. I think there are better places to eat Italian and worse as well. Their best dish seems to be their penne with vodka sauces but the other food is just okay."}
{"text":"I give this place 4.5 stars because it never disappoints. If you don't believe my review, just walk in the place at almost anytime, and you'll see that it is always full. There's usually a 10 minute wait to sit down. This is a good sign! The wait staff is down to earth, usually rushed at peak times, but kind and responsive. The food is comfort food, ah, it's good. I've never had a bad meal there. How can you go wrong with a place that serves a fish parmesana?"}
{"text":"Armstrong's is delicious! Italian comfort food with portions bigger than one person can eat.  The restaurant is comfortable and the wait staff is friendly.  They also do take out, but I have never done that. We had appetizers, entrees and desserts.  The prices are great as well.  It is definitely out of the way in the Caste Village Shoppes but worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Ya know ya really can't go wrong at Armstrong's. I have only recently came here, two times in about 3 weeks because my first visit was so good that I had to make sure they weren't trying to trick me, and they were not playing games with my stomach.   We came here on Mother's Day not to celebrate, because my mother is in a far away land called Milwaukee. But it was obvious that many others came here to celebrate which means only one thing to me, that this place is pretty consistent and good.   Last time I had a Reuben which was pretty standard as far as my law of Reuben Sandwiches go, It had juicy corned beef, kraut, and thousand island or something along those lines served on Rye bread which is in my opinion the way a Reuben should be. The Special Lady had a Salad which was very tasty but so large that she couldn't finish it.   On this visit I had a Steak Deluxe Hogie with an egg on it. I may get blasted for saying this but the contents of this samich rivaled Primanti's I just thought that the bread that Armstrong's uses shouldn't be toasted on a grill but left soft.   I didn't eat desert here but from the looks of what people were eating around us the deserts looked Aaamazing... Might be worth just swinging by here to try one of those in the near future. Each time I have been in this place it was packed with people and there was a short wait, maybe 15 minutes but once we were seated the service was really fast and friendly. I highly recommend you all come here for a pretty standard quick bite to eat in the South Hills area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Portions are huge! My favorite is the wedding soup with the steak hoagie deluxe. Calzones are enormous and enough for 2 meals! Basically anything there is enough for 2 meals.  You really get what you pay for here.  They've catered events at my work place and it was top notch as always,  highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff, extensive menu, and everything I've had is excellent. If you're in the south hills it's a great spot for lunch and dinner with a nicely stocked bar too. The prices are comparable to any of the chains, but the portion size and quality outstrip any sit-down chain you could mention."}
{"text":"My family goes to Armstrong's often. The kids love the Italian bread that comes with the meals.  They also love the wedding soup. My daughter says it's the best soup in town and that's saying a lot!  I have ordered many things and they were all delicious. My favorite is the eggplant parmigiana sandwich.  The eggplant is still crispy when it comes."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying I have eaten here a lot and always had a good experience until last night. We sit down and within two minutes the waitress comes over and asks for our order. Without having time to look at the menu we asked for her to come back in a few minutes. 20 minutes later and empty drinks the waitress took our order. I asked for a side of vegetables and was told they only make enough to serve with the special. I thought this comment was odd because every time I have eaten there and requested them I was not given this answer. We place our order. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink or more water. A few minutes later another staff member came over and quickly got us another drink. The appetizer was brought out with the meals and did not have the extra side of sauce as requested. Finally my salad came with NO dressing. 10 minutes later the waitress appeared with the dressing and side sauce for the appetizer which was extremely cold now. Before she could run away again we asked to order another drink. Overall I was disappointed and shocked on how bad the service was. It was enough to make me not want to go back. Rude and untimely waitress on a TUESDAY! Can you imagine how it would be on a Friday or Saturday. Apparently you get better service at the bar so if you go sit there."}
{"text":"Just ate a Armstrong's, what a great experience. The staff really make you feel welcome. The food was great as usual. Whether you are in the mood for a sandwich or a full meal this place will not disappoint. Highly recommend the chicken parm!"}
{"text":"Armstrongs is the \"Cheers\" of the South Hills of Pittsburgh. Usually, you will meet someone who \"knows your name.\" Patrons are of all ages and all professions and trades. Ninety nine persent of all patrons are Steeler fans. The staff most definitly knows your name and will share pictures of thier family and their opinions. And by the way, the food and service is great. The desserts are hugh and absolutely delicious. You gotta try the Tuesday night special...."}
{"text":"Two words......... BAKED ARTICHOKES ....... you might not think of them as devilishly delicious ... but ,you'd be wrong ...... tasty appetizer that you don't often find in most restaurants..... try 'em .... you'll be hooked . Very professional & friendly staff.... food gets to your table quick..... fair prices.... whats not to like about Armstrongs ?"}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem to know what type of restaurant it wants to be.  Set up like a dinner bar restaurant but loud and dirty like a cafeteria in a hospital.  Wait staff was rude and would knock you over if you we daring enough to get in their path. Food was mediocre. Had buffalo wings (dry over cooked in a franks flavor sauce) and pizza bread (French bread pizza with grocery store pizza sauce). Both could be made in a microwave with better results. I had a veal parm sandwich (best part of the meal) wife had \"homemade\" ravioli (generic sauce and watery cheesy pasta). Nothing about this place makes you want to return. Talked the wife out of olive garden to try something new. What I got was a bland meal that cost me more. Ps. My beer was also old."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences! 4 of us plus a baby entered the restaurant and just stood near the hostess table for 5 minutes with no one greeting us. Finally we interrupted the 3 hostesses and asked to be sat.  The girl that sat us was so annoyed that we asked for a table vs a booth. Such an attitude.   The worst part was when I asked if I could just have pasta with spinach (I do not eat meat or cheese). The very nice waitress, asked the chef/owner and came back with this response: \"we do not have a recipe for that\".  I was speechless!! I asked if she needed the recipe: pasta.....spinach!! She apologized, but said the chef will not do it. I then asked for a side of cooked spinach and she said they can not do that either.   My solution: I took the spinach out of the salad that came with my dinner (which was delicious) and added it to the pasta I ordered!! Dear chef/owner see attached pictures for \"recipe\"!   No I will not return!   I did tip the server well, not her fault she works in such a ridged restaurant!   6/28/18 7pm"}
{"text":"Well...partly Yelp is to blame because I searched for steaks and this was a result I got...but there was only one steak on the menu and it was a sirloin. Not what I had in mind...but putting that aside.  I saw 4 stars and a good amount of reviews with only 2 dollar signs. I figured it would be a decent casual dining place. It was.  I know...I know...you do not come to Pittsburgh for shrimp. I got them anyway and they were just fine. Not bad, not great...but fried shrimp, decent. The Caesar dressing was good with enough achovie flavor. It was above average just because the dressing didn't stink. My favorite thing was the seafood bisque. Tasty small crab bits in a creamy broth with a little bite, was good. I like to try Italian sausage when I go different places. They had a spicy Italian sausage, so I ordered a side of that. The consistency of the sausage bothered me some. Like it had been boiled for a long time...ya know what I mean? Kinda mushy. It did have a good flavor though, it was just off putting that it was so soft.  The drinks were good."}
{"text":"I've eaten both in the restaurant and had takeout.  It's Italian comfort food--rich sauces, plenty of carbs, and meat dishes galore.  Most recently, we've had takeout from there, twice over one weekend (don't judge, I've been unwell).  I've had both the hot sausage and meatball casseroles, hot roast beef sandwich and the buffalo chicken salad.  The casseroles are as they sound, meat buried in fettuccine and sauce, smothered in lots (and lots) of mozzarella.  A great go-to if you love cheese.  Meals come with fresh white/Italian bread, butter, and soup or salad--we usually go with wedding soup.  The soup is great when it's not over-salted, as it was today. It's filled with italian meatballs, shredded chicken, onion, spinach, and pasta (acini di pepe).  The roast beef was a typical sandwich--filling with a potato and smothered with gravy.  I don't recommend this for takeout, as the sandwich bread is a mushy mess by the time you get it. If you want it, ask for the gravy on the side.  By the next day, the italian bread is stale, so eat it with your meal or save it for homemade breadcrumbs.  The service has always been exemplary, and the staff friendly, even over the phone or late into the evening.    Most disappointing was today's order. I typically cook a Sunday meal, but haven't been feeling well, so we ordered for a second time this weekend (no judgement, remember?).  I had the meatball casserole and my husband ordered the penne ala vodka with chicken, both with wedding soups and bread.  The meals arrived hot, wrapped to the extreme with saran wrap (they don't kid around with securing your food).  I remember my hot sausage casserole having tons of meat mixed in with the pasta, but the meatball casserole only had two meatballs.  That may be standard, but I wonder how it's different from the pasta with meatballs.  Don't get me wrong, the meatballs are excellent. The red sauce is smooth and not too acidic, and goes well with the pasta, but my fettuccine was way overdone to the point where it was too soft and a fork effortlessly cut the noodles like butter.  Sauce was only on one side of my dish, so the entire other side was just overcooked pasta; there was definitely not enough sauce for the entire dish. I hadn't known since there was so much cheese over it that I couldn't tell until I put it away as leftovers, which is also when I found a shorter brown hair in the second meatball.  I thought it may be my husband's, until I realized it was cooked into the meatball.  Leftovers went into the garbage. My husband loved the penne ala vodka sauce, but his meal was missing the chicken. Total price was around $34, so I'm assuming we were charged for penne ala vodka with chicken rather than the penne ala vodka. That, or the prices have gone up and the Yelp Menu is not up to date, because, total, the meal should have been around $30 with tax.  It was already late into the evening and our child needed to go to bed, so calling and picking up new food would have been too much effort, and I was already feeling guilty for having takeout nearly every night this weekend.  Rather, it was easier to just make a mental note to use caution when choosing to eat here again.  Out of the half-dozen times or so we've eaten here over the past 6 months, this was by far the most disappointing, though for a myriad of reasons. That's probably the only reason for 3 stars, considering the meals prior to this one."}
{"text":"Fast service, huge portions, and comfortable atmosphere!  Try the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in Pittsburgh!!  It's not a fancy place and there's usually a wait for dinner, but it's well worth it.  The portions are large and the food is delicious!  I highly recommend the fried provolone sticks and the wedding soup.  The baked scrod is delicious too.  I've never had anything bad here!  If you haven't been here yet, you need to go ASAP with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Armstrongs is such a staple for when your American-Italian craving strikes. Huge portions of your traditional classics like Penne Vodka, Chicken Parm, Baked Ziti, you get the idea.   Food-wise, you'll leave satisfied, but the food is simple so nothing really earth-shattering or incredibly creative. I can't say I have a favorite dish here because everything is good, but if you're looking to fill up on carbs, this is where it's at. Like I said earlier, expect to go home with leftovers because the portions are ginormous!  I really like the family-owned, small-business feel here. Whether they are any of those, I'm not sure. I do know that they have other locations in the Pittsburgh area. I've been here and the other locations on numerous occasions and it's always packed. The food was also equally satisfying and consistent at each location."}
{"text":"The staff here is unbelievably disrespectful. From hostess especially to a select few waitresses. DONT GO THERE. The food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"We made a last minute lunch reservation for 20. Everyone on the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. Linda our waitress went above and beyond. The food portions were generous and the prices very reasonable. We ordered casseroles,bistros, chicken parm, Romano., and other entrees. Everyone was completely stuffed and satisfied. Thank you Armstrong's for a great experience - and again thank you Linda for an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"Becoming a nightmare and will be a dive if things don't change soon.  Kids at the bar drinking coke and their families as well.. not adult friendly when you want a 7 Dollar drink and can't sit because kids at bar taking up adult  space"}
{"text":"Cozy, down-home and super friendly, this restaurant made the grade.   I didn't try the pasta, but my chicken sandwich with provolone and mushrooms was generously portioned and the side salad (a $2.00 up charge) was garnished with goodies. I felt okay about this.   More than anything, I was blown away by the friendly service. The waitress was super busy, yet attentive, and willing to go the extra mile when something wasn't quite right. Even the young guy cleaning tables was willing to help. How sweet?  I don't know if the prices, which are a little steeper than most restaurants like this, are worth it. But I would come back to find out."}
{"text":"I love Armstrong's at Caste Village.   Extensive menu, generous portions, delicious food, friendly staff.  One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Love Love!  Have Followed Armstrong's from location to location!  Love everything on the menu, from salads to soups to pasta and entrées. Large portions and seasoned staff. Real crab in stuffed mushrooms!! Worth the price. Great pies too usually take home dessert along with tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"Service was nice and friendly. Food was bland and tasteless. Seems like a place for a much older crowd."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for dinner on a Saturday night for her bday, she turned 15 and said that's what she wanted to do so ok not arguing cause this place is great, only waited 10 minutes,  they had a new your strip for a special only 4 left, got it just in time and glad I did considering the only thing I eat there is the calazones my favorite,  everyone is so nice there, we had Zack as our server, he was great and on top of things, I love the teamwork and friendliness from the whole staff,"}
{"text":"Armstrong's is a staple for my family and I. We've been going here for years, since I was a kid. I've never had a bad meal here. Their wings are the best I've ever had. They're crunchy and tender and the sauces you can choose from are tasty. I usually get the linguine with white clam sauce which is always a solid choice. The flavor is on point and there are so many clams. I also love the steak salad which has caramelized onions on it and that elevates the salad like crazy for me. The bistro sandwiches are also delicious! Think Primantis sandwich but 100% better. They toast the bread on the stove and it's just so good. The portions at this place are ridiculous, in a good way. They give you A LOT of food which I actually enjoy because I can take it home for a meal the next day. All in all, always a good choice and they've been around forever so I think that's a great sign of good food!"}
{"text":"i love this place. probably one of my favorite places to eat.  they have a large menu .. great salads, sandwhichs, hoagies, pastas, apps .. i've never had a bad meal here! they have a great drink selection as well and the servers/bartenders are very friendly."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be, they jacked their prices and there is a notable problem with flies (went there twice in January - the flies outside are all dead)."}
{"text":"Always a good meal here. The Chicken Romano is yummy. Great Antipasto salads too! Definitely try this one!"}
{"text":"Husband and I like getting food to-go as sometimes the wait time and service can be lacking here on the weekends.  I love their caprese salad with grilled chicken. It comes with a generous portion of delicious mozzarella balls and roasted red peppers.  I also like the fettuccine alfredo, however it is much better eating in then getting to go. Husband really likes the italian meats on the hoagie as well as the cheeseburger. Proton sizes are very generous so it's a great value. Great traditional italian restaurant that is leaps and bounds ahead of the likes of olive garden and pasta too."}
{"text":"What else is there to say about Armstrongs? They have the best chicken parm HANDS DOWN! everything is so fresh and high quality. We usually order take out which is super fast and you get so much food!  We do usually just order 1 chicken parm with double pasta as the sides and it is way more than enough for two people. They do not skimp you here!"}
{"text":"Simply really good food at great prices. A wide selection of Italian based items are available on their menu. The Penne with Vodka sauce is some of best we have had anywhere. The seafood is always fresh and flavorful. We have also enjoyed their catering for office parties. A great value. They also have housemade desserts and alcohol available, Some of our favorites are the mushroom and brie soup ((yum)), the penne with vodka, chicken with sweet peppers and provolone, the baked stuffed scrod, and all their pasta dishes look amazing. We can't wait to try more in the future, it just hard not to always order our favorites. There is a reason why this place is always busy, so expect a short wait around dinner time and certainly on weekend. But do wait, it is worth it, and I rarely say that about most places."}
{"text":"I'm from the South Hills, so naturally I have heard of Armstrong's and visited many times with my family when I was younger. However, it has probably been over 10 years since I have visited. I came here on Thursday for lunch with my younger cousin, who is a huge fan of Armstrong's. We were sat right away. This place was bumpin', there was tons of people here, however, our service was great and the food was quick. My little cousin had pasta with butter & parm and I tried their buffalo chicken salad. My cousin adored her pasta, as it is literally her favorite meal ever. I was surprised with the huge portion of my salad. It was delicious. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful and the fries were tasty as well. I loved that it was so packed with veggies and that so many of the veggies were cooked- mushrooms, onions, peppers- they all gave the salad so much more depth and flavor. Our server was fantastic and really patient with my little cousin when she was ordering her food and drinks. We had a fantastic time and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh to eat.  Great portions and delicious food.   I get the eggplant stuffed with ricotta ( it is breaded so I order is sauteed since I am gluten free).  They also have very good salads, the dressings are all fantastic.   This is a busy place so be prepared to wait for dinner."}
{"text":"Armstrong's is apparently the place to be on a weekend night if you live in the Whitehall area. Hubs has gotten take out from Armstrong's a few times but I had never actually been inside. This time it was my turn. I stopped by Armstrong's on a busy Saturday night. I was rather surprised to find that the inside is actually rather nice for what you would expect in a strip mall. While I waited for our food to be ready and watched the game on the t.v. in the waiting area, a party of 40 arrived. Yep, I said 40! Also, four others arrived for their take out within 10 minutes!  Now for the food, I ordered the penne vodka with chicken while hubs ordered a chicken sandwich. My penne vodka was creamy and delicious. If you like a creamy vodka sauce, Armstrong's is for you. I prefer a slightly more tangy vodka sauce but I enjoyed this sauce none the less. Did I mention the portion size? I had pasta for three days! The pasta also came with a salad. Nice size salad as well with field greens, tomato, olive and chic peas. Unfortunately, the vinagerette dressing was rather bland and tasteless. Thus the reason for 4 stars rather than five. Overall, Armstrong's seems to be a great family oriented Italian restaurant in Whitehall/Bethel Park area."}
{"text":"I love the food, but $6.70 for a 10 oz. Draft beer????? Not sure if this is greed or stupidity..."}
{"text":"Solid.  Great service, nothing fancy, high quality food with good portions for a fair price."}
{"text":"Best place in the south hills.   We like to sit st he bar because the staff here is so friendly.   Food is always and I mean always perfect."}
{"text":"When I go to visit my grandma, we go to Armstrong's.  The prices appear to be high when you look at the menu, but the portions are massive.  I've been coming here for years, and I've never had anything bad.  Some favorites are the veal cutlet sandwich (FAV), veal parmesan, Italian hoagie, and manicotti.  Every dinner comes with fresh bread, and every meal makes two full meals for me.  The sandwiches are MASSIVE.  You can easily just split one between two people.  The service is pretty good, but we always come at a non-peak time to avoid the wait.  I've never been overly impressed by the desserts, and you really won't need one after the meal.  It's always FREEZING in here so bring a sweater if you chill easily!!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely off the bar and what our friends that we were with were saying about the food.  We plan on being back and I will write about my own personal experience with the food then.   This place is kinda tucked away in a plaza in Castle Shannon (we went bowling so we went there after a Saturday of open bowling at Princess Lanes).  Our friends wanted to get an early dinner and a drink or two, so we joined them (we do not eat dinner that early).  One thing is for sure, if you want to get seated right away on a Saturday, I think you need to get to Armstrong's early based on what we had seen.  The place got packed.   Our friends just had a veal parm dish and a pasta dish.  Both were exceptional according to them.  What I liked about the place was the service... the bartender was great (we sat there since we were not eating and our friends ate at the bar), they were attentive and fast (never an empty water glass) and it was just overall a pleasant experience.  They had a basic bar, and their prices were more than reasonable (and the cabernet I was drinking was actually pretty good).    We cannot wait to come back and try a real dinner ourselves."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing no matter what you get. Very large portions.  You can't go wrong whether you get pasta, a salad, or my personal favorite, the buffalo chicken tenders.  Great ranch and bread as well."}
{"text":"I got the wings, pizza and pasta and it was soooo good! I recommended this place to my boss because she likes to treat us all to lunch sometimes and this place has become a regular for us at the office!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly and attententive bar staff.  Portions are generous.  I never leave this place disappointed"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the portion of anything I've ever ordered at Armstrong's has been enormous. They didn't disappoint on portion size at all, in fact I ordered the mushroom \"steak\" hoagie, it was large enough to feed two. I will say the bun was mushy and unlike others who reviewed it neither of ours tasted like steak but more like roast beef. Now roast beef hoagies are fine if that's what I'm ordering and when I want one I go to Arby's where I can get them 2 for $5 not $12. Lessons learned by me, next time I'll ask if it's steak or roast beef and order accordingly. I also feel restaurants need to be more transparent in what they serve."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Armstrongs and don't mind if there's a wait. The service and food is A+ I definitely would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I took my father here last night for his birthday dinner. I've always loved Armstrongs and it never fails to let me down. I had the stuffed shrimp with crab meat and it was phenomenal. I highly recommend this entree. The crabmeat was not over cooked it was extremely moist, as well as the shrimp. My father had the steak hoagie which he loves. We also had the chocolate mocha cheesecake for dessert, which was to die for! Our server was extraordinary, she even stayed and chatted with us for a while which is nice, and she bought my father a drink for his birthday. I highly recommend this place if you have never been! Oh and you must try the fried mozzarella sticks. Best in town!!"}
{"text":"Food quality has went downhill. Service is horrible, even though they aren't as busy as the use to be. Explain why I have to ask my waitress for everything. Literally, silverware, napkin, and even plates. May as well take it to go!"}
{"text":"Armstrong's is another huge-portion Italian diner, this one being stuck right at one end of Caste Village near Frisch's. I grew up close to this place, so I have been here several times - when I was younger, I thought Armstrong's was a nice restaurant, probably mostly because the menu can go up to $19.95(Most entres are around $14, Sandwiches around $10).  I have some family in town and my mom decided she wanted to go here and I agreed. So upon entering some 6 or so years(maybe more) later - 70 Yelp reviews in tow and a couple of upscale dinners in my belly over the years, I was confused: Vinyl booths, linoleum floors, bright cafeteria lights. What happened to the Armstrong's I remember as being a nicer restaurant? Truth be told, it's always been like this. The menus are written somewhat nicely and the waiters are all dressed to look about like what you'd find in an Olive Garden - I feel like this place is in an (perpetual) identity crisis. On one hand it wants to serve good Italian food that isn't exactly cheap for the area(There are 2 or 3 other restaurants in this complex alone that are decently cheaper than it), on the other it wants to be 'the neighborhood place' and come off as welcoming and not upscale.  Anyways, after about 15 minutes we were quickly seated. I was forgetful of how the restaurant was so I decided instead of try and find an old flame here, I'd try something new - and settled on the Linguine Puttanesca, a blend of pasta, olive oil, tomatoes, olives, and hot peppers and it came with bread and wedding soup. We also got fried Zucchini, a Pittsburgh staple. The bread came out, half of a large loaf, along with the zucchini, 5 huge(most of us only took half of one) planks of mostly breading. Both were tasty, the zucchini coming with marinara that spurred a lot of bread-dipping, and also came with a horseradish sauce which was not bashful in the least. That stuff'll kick your ass. My cousin even saved that for her entree, just in case. I gave my mom the wedding soup.  The entrees came, and I was shocked to see how much food we got. I saw the other table get their food and it looked mountainous(Even to eat a normal sandwich plate seemed to be an insurmountable feat), but the other reviews are right. Three meals, count 'em. Mine was only OK  - having been noted as 'hot & spicy!' on the menu, it was not in the least. The olives were just canned sliced olives, and overall it was just not very flavorful. It didn't taste bad, just not really what I wanted. However, the ladies of the group all got chicken salads(My turned-California cousin was understandably confused as to why french fries had found their way into a salad) which they raved about - and I do remember having a few steak salads from here years ago that I loved, as long as I got it sans-mushrooms.  Also, my brother got a shrimp and scallop entree which I have to admit, was not quite so hugely portioned. He finished it with ease, but this was the only dish to suffer that fate. The waitress came with boxes, the salads barely fit in them, there was so much left. The cost was about $20/person after everything was said and done. Not terrible, especially for the amount of food we got.  All in all, Armstrong's is just another family Italian place to grab a quick bite, especially if you're a fan of leftovers or sharing. I wouldn't be opposed to stopping back for an occasion like this, but I don't think I'd hike out here on my own."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is amazing. The portions are generous too. Most of the staff are courteous and professional, just a small percentage aren't. The decor is very 1980's, but I love it. Gives a vintage feel. The restaurant is very clean.   The only issue I ever encountered was when I was pregnant and requested a booth because I had terrible leg problems. The hostess said there weren't any available. I asked if we could be seated in the corner area. She said that space is only open on weekends. She did apologize for the inconvenience and shared her empathy. However, instead of seating us back into the waiting area after waiting 10 minutes already, she could have said 'let me talk to a manager to see what I can do.' Now, perhaps this is my fault for not requesting a booth in the first place, but I was 38 weeks and tired.   I understand they have this area blocked for a reasons unbeknownst to me, but one could clearly see a very pregnant in need of more comfortable seating. It's not like I was requesting the booth just because I just wanted, I had a NEED for it.   Other than this issue, Armstrong's is a wonderful place to get some great Italian food."}
{"text":"This is a Fantastic place for good quality ,BIG quantity dinners. Nestled in a quaint little shopping center near Castle Shannon , no parking problems , fast easy seating , not too noisey , very nice menu. very reasonable prices. friendly staff. Defiantly not a hipster place ,  nice bar. Clean dinning area and rest room."}
{"text":"Stopped to eat on the way home from work.   Wanted to eat at the bar but it was full so we got a table.   Service was ok.  Food was very good (wedding soup, wings, stuffed peppers, prov sticks, Rachel).   We would have have another drink, coffee and dessert ......  but the family at the table next to us decided they were at Chuck E Cheese.    They actually took their 2 toddlers in the Closed Off section of the restaurant and let them run around and scream like banshees.   Un. Believable.   Both that a parent actually found this appropriate and that management let them.   Completely unacceptable on both counts.    The closed off section was dark and had chairs stacked up so from a liability standpoint, Armstrongs should have stopped it immediately.  Not to mention, they were disrupting the whole place.   The section was in the back near the restrooms and when we left - before getting to enjoy drinks and dessert on a rare night out - you could hear them up front in the lobby.     Disappointing from many aspects.    Not to mention Armstrongs lost out on more revenue.   And probly not just from us."}
{"text":"A vegetarian's worst nightmare! Their tomato sauce has chicken and beef stock in it and literally pounds of butter. Just regular tomato sauce! I unfortunately found this out the hard way when I ordered just plain pasta and left with the biggest stomach ache. They should warn you on the menu.  Their portions are seriously huge. I went again and ordered a grilled cheese and it was large and really plain. It's nothing special. Fries are dry. It's always packed though so somebody apparently likes it. I just don't get it, though!"}
{"text":"Reminiscing about places I loved to eat while growing up in Pittsburgh Armstrong's always comes to mind. I live in CA now but whenever I make it home I always try to make it to Armstrong's. Originally went to the one by the Grove with the huge Mahoney's sign above it, I remember originally referring to it as such. The appetizer sampler with fried zucchini, mushrooms, and provolone was an all time favorite. Can't wait to go home now."}
{"text":"Kind of greasy, but it's a unique diner style restaurant.  I enjoy it for fish sandwiches and mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Darren forgot to mention the baked artichokes (we had them at the Corapolis location once). We had them here as well, and they are scrumptious! Their linguini with clam sauce is very good as well. They also make their own yummy, yummy pies and cakes. As others said, Armstrong's is like Eat n Park but a little classier and a little pricier and with a bar.  Nice service too."}
{"text":"*Armstrong's is akin to a more upscale (with more Italian dishes) Eat'n Park*   Armstrong's is located inside of the Caste Village Shopping Center. There is a full bar and the menu is large; many salads and a lot of good Italian dishes.  Pricing is moderate, think of an Eat'n Park for the slightly snobby. Good for Kids and Groups.  On busier nights, expect a very long wait!! There is a large waiting area for this, however.  PROS: Very Clean; Friendly Staff; Full Bar; Food quality (which is good) is Consistent.  CONS: The wait can be outrageous at times! The food (though good, is not anything extraordinary or overwhelming delicious)."}
{"text":"As with any restaurant, you got to order the right thing.  You can't go to a seafood restaurant and order steak and expect that to be the best choice.  That said... I've never had anything here that wasn't a great choice.  They have a delicate way with flounder, a perfect grilling technique for beef.. and the french fries are perfecto.  And so on.  As another reviewer noted, a pasta dish is three meals worth.  (Even the side dish of pasta will give you TWO meals worth.)  The desserts taste \"Local\" and not frozen.  (If I wanted frozen food, I'd to to the grocery and buy that!)  The wait staff is patient and helpful.   There is a reason that people are willing to wait in line for an hour and a half to get into this restaurant..  My advice:  call ahead!!!  I wish I lived closer than 60 miles away!"}
{"text":"Armstrongs has the perfect menu for all eaters. This place never disappoints. I've had so many items but some of my favorites are the wedding soup, salads, penne al la vodka, chicken Parmesan, stuffed shrimp, garlic Parmesan wings, and fried zucchini. The portions are huge and I'm always bringing home a doggie bag. Expect a wait on the weekends, but they also do call ahead.  A tip if you have little ones - they do have a kids Menu and drink cups, but not crayons or coloring. Make sure you bring something if you count on that to keep them busy! Less importantly but may be important you - the decor is a little dated, but that does not bother me when they are serving up delicious dishes as they do. They also do an awesome take out service and good catering options."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that This review is only the 24th of this established Pittsburgh landmark restaurant. After all, this is their third location, having established themselves on Mt Washington right on Grandview Ave. this is where I fell in love with their food. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review.   My last visit here was in October of 2012, I had a cousin visiting from San Diego and on her last night she wanted Armstrongs. They were able to seat the twelve of us without any issues. The place was empty, odd for Armstrongs, but it was a weeknight and only about 5:30. The menu is long and extensive, as any well established Italian restaurant would be. I narrowed my choices to the Fusilli with marinara or eggplant parm. I chose the pasta fearing the eggplant would be deep fried, loaded with fatty cheese. It was, one of our party ordered it and it was saturated with grease.  Four waiters brought out food to the table and honestly when the food was sitting on the table I said it reminded me of when my great grandmother would cook Sunday Supper after 11am mass. The portions here are huge and just good old fashioned home style cooking.  My fusilli was perfectly al dente, the marinara was a tad watery, but flavorful, even without the addition of parm cheese. A little red pepper gave it some zing and excitement. My mother had the fish sandwich with fries and slaw and said it was as good as she remembered. Two huge fillets of cod, batter dipped with tarter sauce.  Most of the table had lasagna, which is a huge portion.   Armstrongs will never be fashionable in the foodies circle, it is what it is, home style cooking with huge portions and a place that brings back lots of good memories, and fills the belly."}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch and the place was packed.    I had the Italian Stromboli, which was excellent.   It was massively filled with pepperoni, salami, ham, onions, cheese and sauce.   The proportion of ingredients was perfect and then it was baked to perfection.   Probably the best I have ever had.  My husband had the wedding soup which he loved, as well as the stuffed chicken breast with mashed potatoes.   Everything was hot and very tasty.  My Mom had the salmon with mashed potatoes.   She liked the salmon, but the potatoes were too lumpy for her.  The portions are huge so we have enough for lunch or dinner tomorrow.  Service was good, even though they were busy.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Armstrong's, I just can't stay away.  Every time I'm near by my parents house, I suggest that we stop at Armstrong's.  I'm not sure if there's anything in particular that Armstrong's is doing out of the ordinary, but their food makes me feel like I'm a part of their big family. The food is primarily Italian and has a lot of heart. The portions you get for any dish are always more than enough to take home for leftovers.  During my last visit I ordered the chicken salad and my boyfriend got a calzone. I chose ranch as my dressing- I don't know what they put in it but it is the best ranch I've had hands down. My salad came with some garlic toast, was full of veggies and chicken, and was also \"Pittsburgh-ized\" and included fries. The calzone was literally gigantic and had as big of a flavor. It was saucy, cheesy, and crispy.  This place is easy to find a seat in during the day or weekday night, but if you're looking for a spot on a weekend evening make sure you get there early as there's usually a pretty decent wait."}
{"text":"Waited over a hr for a table just to be disappointed.  Weakest alferdo sauce in western pa."}
{"text":"Numerous terrible experiences. Most recently my wife and her best friend dined in and had enough issues with that experience to receive a $25.00 gift certificate to refund/replace their meals. So we decided to do take out this evening and ordered simply traditional spaghetti with mushroom sauce and an order of ravioli. When I got home and opened my spaghetti it wasn't spaghetti but angel hair, which I had not asked for and don't really care for as its too thin of a pasta for my liking as well as for it to be done correctly has to be carefully cooked as to not be overdone. And what I got was a container full of mush it was way overdone and basically a big ball of semolina mush. The sauce was ok at best and as I'm sure any pasta aficionado can tell you the number 1 thing they probably hate when eating pasta out, at home wherever is it not being properly drained and having water in it watering down the sauce, making a mess and basically rendering it inedible as was the case with that. So meal #1,  complete waste. My wife then proceeded to open her ravioli, to sum it up overdone, way overstuffed, and tasted horrible as to not use words I'd really prefer to describe it. So meal #2 also total waste. So $30 for inedible food. Not pleased. Especially when I can go to one of my favorite PIZZA places mind you that is their specialty and they are great at it, on West Liberty Ave at Capital Ave if you can't figure it out you are totally missing out. Anyway I can go there any time of day or night on a moments notice, order any of the pasta offerings there, for way less than what Armstrong's charges, and it's done Al Dente to perfection EVERY TIME.  Just an example. Anyway, I've eaten at the restaurant as well as done take out and I hate to say it but they've missed the mark by a lot every last time and this was our last time.  So I've chosen to air out my frustrations with the place here, as opposed to calling and complaining once again, getting refunded, again, and going through the whole waste of time once again to be disappointed. So I'm not doing that, and instead a scathing review for anyone who uses Yelp to assist in their dinner time dining out decisions."}
{"text":"We arrived at 615p. There was no wait at that time, and we were sat for a table of four immediately. I was surprised by this as I'm always hearing how busy it always is. Anyway. We were sat at a booth. The server came over within just a few minutes to get our drink order. When the other two of our party arrived, the server came over and got there drink order timely. The server forgot about their water, but at this time the server was getting bombarded with tables, so we were not going to hold that against him. We ordered our food.     We received our salads in about 15 minutes. The entrees took quite a bit longer. We read reviews that did say that the turn around and service was slow, but they are not exaggerating. I am hoping the reason for the kitchen to be so slow is because all the food is made to order. Being that the other guests and I have all been servers in the past, we were not going to hold this against the server, but I'm sure other tables did.     The food. The dinner salads were a good size, served with tomatoes, cucumber, mild peppers, and cheese. We also got two orders of a side of meatballs that were decent size, and in a bowl of their tomato sauce. All the entrees were big and could definitely be shared! I ordered the steak salad, as I had a race the next morning. The salad was huge. The steak was an actual fillet, marinated and not dry. I also ordered the chocolate mousse cake for desert, which was amazing!    Bring your stomachs along with your patience and conversation topics! I'd say we will return. It was nice to not be rushed and enjoys the company. We headed out around 8:30 and there was a very long wait at the front. So I guess 6pm is a good time to get there."}
{"text":"I came here with my family back in March to celebrate my parents getting married. The atmosphere was great and comfortable. The food portions were huge. I ordered a philly cheesteak sub that was delicious. My mom and husband both ordered the steak salads. My dad and sister had the hot wings. I can't remember what my brother had. Everything was so tasty. Our waitress was amazing and so sweet (my dad actually told the manager at the end of our meal). We had a delicious food, having fun with good company. It doesn't really get much better than that. The best part of the meal though, by far, was the red velvet cake for dessert. It was so good that it's re-sparked my love of cake."}
{"text":"I stand by my original review and do love Armstrong's! Service is very fast, people are friendly and the food delicious! My favorite is the penne a la vodka but the manicotti with the vodka sauce was delicious too!   The interior could use some updates but I can live with that if the food is good!"}
{"text":"I came into this place with really high hopes. My mother and grandmother both love this Italian place and insisted we all go. It's a half hour drive for us all to get there, so we made a special trip over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend to get everyone's fix.   I was let down for the most part with my experience. It's a very outdated restaurant but maybe that's not of concern to the patrons. As I looked around, most of the customers were elderly so I already felt a little out of place. Even at a table near the bar, seemingly far away from the door, I could still feel a cold draft.   They started us out with a basket of bread and butter. Unfortunately we had no silverware for about five minutes until our waitress returned to take our food orders, so it just taunted us for a while in all its carbohydrated goodness.  For the appetizer, we chose the fried mozzarella which was good. The sticks were larger than something you'd see in your frozen food section and were about $7 for 7 pieces.   My main meal was a bit of a let down. I've become routine in trying chicken parmesan dishes at Italian restaurants. The chicken seemed too thin and as a result the breading was overpowering. It was somewhat tough and apparently overcooked. The chicken was swimming in a lot of sauce so there was plenty to scoop up with the bread. The pasta that came as a side dish was thoroughly al dente and too tough for me, so you might want to request it cooked a little more if you like softer pasta.   The one major positive is their desserts. I tried two of the cheesecake offerings and they were both heaping slices and very delicious.  If anything, I'll be back for their desserts alone. The whole meal was a tad pricey and ended up about $100 with tip for the 3 of us. Looking forward to trying a different entree next time to change my opinion."}
{"text":"Just go and eat and enjoy. We were 10. To the person we had a great meal. And we took good home. You have to be this good in order to be busy every night.   How this place can get so many dishes to come out hot and delicious and not over it under cooked with not too much spices. Everything is fresh. How can it not be fresh? They sell do much too so many people. By the way. The deserts are all make from scratch.  Bob"}
{"text":"Armstrong's...yeah, it's pretty good stuff. It's got your Italian-American favorites. All the Parmesan's. Chicken, Veal, Shrimp, Eggplant. Good subs, good appetizers. Good desserts. Portions are more than one average person could eat.   Their meatballs are excellent. The salads are excellent. The probably have some of the best italian salad dressing going.   A stand out to me is the Penne Ala Vodka with grilled chicken.   It's a family place and it's been around for a long time for a reason. It's good."}
{"text":"I came here with a few girlfriends for a night out. Our dinners all looked amazing. My grilled chicken salad was delicious. Not only was it a great size, the chicken had a great flavor to it and the fries and cheese on top of was wonderful. We all shared the chocolates banana pie and that was delicious!! I've been here on multiple occasions and never had anything bad to eat."}
{"text":"I work in very close proximity to Armstrong's (luckily!). They have become my go to lunch spot. I usually opt for take out and every time I walk in my order is ready and waiting at the counter.  The staff is welcoming, friendly and prompt.  The food is large portions and always fresh and delicious. It reminiscent of a home cooked meal. I usually have enough to save for lunch the next day, which makes it an even better deal :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since it was located at the Galleria in Mount Lebanon.  I've since moved to Washington, DC, but still visit whenever remotely possible.  The prices are reasonable, the food is delicious, and the portions are huge.  I usually get either a steak calzone (used to take forever for them to cook, but now it's much faster), a chicken parmigiana sandwich, a huge bowl of baked ziti, or the lasagna.  I've even ordered quarts of sauce to take home on multiple occasions because it's incredible.  For dessert, try the coconut cream pie.  Hands down, my favorite restaurant of all time!"}
{"text":"This place intrigues me. The food is okay, nothing outstanding or remarkable, but every day at lunch and dinner there is a crowd. On the weekends it's a zoo. There are a lot of restaurants I like but none that I would call a \" family tradition\" or would go to non-stop.  I really live trying new places. This restaurants has patrons that have been eating there for years. It also has a few wait staff that have been there just as long.  I usually order the Meatball Casserole but this visit I ordered two appetizers instead-Toasted Ravioli and Garlic-Parm wings. The ravioli was rather bland and didn't have much flavor. They were very crispy either. The maranara dipping sauce made them edible. The wings didn't look appealing but tasted good. They were crispy but needed a little more sauce. My husband ordered the stuffed peppers. They were a lot smaller in size than usual but carried a nice bite of heat.  For dessert we put dibs in on the peach cobbler. It is a great dessert. It comes to your table hot and topped with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect ending to a meal. When they offer the cobbler it sells out quick so order it with your meal so they will hold you one. They are individually baked. It's because of the cobbler that I gave a 3 star review instead of a lower one.  It's a Pittsburgh home town locally owned place so you have to go once just to experience. The portions are huge so you will be taking food home."}
{"text":"You get a ton of food here and you'll also pay just a bit too much for it...even the salads are boarder line ridiculous in size. If you can stand the attitude of the host/hostess, you'll be fine once you sit and get your meal. Decent food, ok prices, customer service could use some improvement here."}
{"text":"Dined at Armstrong's last evening with my husband and son. Both the boys ordered Chicken Romano and Italian Wedding Soup. The soup was delicious and so was the Chicken Romano - tender and perfectly cooked. I ordered Grilled Cheese (provolone) with French fries, also perfectly cooked. Friendly staff, environment sort of like the old Pappan's restaurant - casual, family friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Italian places I've been to. Dining room was very open. Tables were not right on top of one another. Very big dining area and very clean.  Waitress was very fast and efficient. Very friendly. We didn't have to sit long before she came over to take our drinks followed by are meals. We did have to wait 20 minutes but most definitely well worth it.   We had the chicken parmesan in the homemade gnocchi. The chicken parmesan was so tender and moist. Not too much breading just enough. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The side of pasta that came with it was not done enough. But the order of gnocchi that we got was out of this world. Done to perfection with just the right seasonings to taste. I would highly recommend.  To finish off our meals we got the chocolate moose mocha cake. Hands down one of the best cakes that I have had in a long time. Definitely homemade very moist and flavorful. Most places you go to serve a tiny piece of cake. This cake was huge and could probably feed at least 4 people. Very reasonable price for such a large portion.   This is definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"One of the best things I can say about our experience on this Saturday night was that our wait was less than ten minutes at a restaurant that does not accept reservations or offer phone-ahead seating. I have waited forty minutes here in the past.  The food is delicious although the fried zucchini is not as good as some of our other favorite places.  The bowl of wedding soup that is included with pasta entrees as one of the side dish choices is mammoth and delicious, filled with meatballs, chicken, and egg.  It could be a meal.  It compensates for entrees that are priced in the high teens.  No one is particularly friendly or engaging here.  Our server was efficient, but she rushed us.  The courses were delivered fast and the entrees arrived before we could both finish our soup or put much of a dent in our zucchini.  There was no quality check and we were not asked if we wanted any of the desserts which are restaurant specialties.  The immediate presentation of the courses was something I would expect at a diner, not a fine full-service restaurant where one is enjoying a Saturday night meal for which the tariff for two will be in excess of $50.  When I am spending that much money, I expect cloth napkins, not Armstrong's paper napkins. We like it here but we are going to be more inclined to dine at Atria's Peters Township and Franco's Trattorias, where not only is delicious food offered, but where the owners and servers roll out the red carpet for us."}
{"text":"Thanks so much for not seating our party of 8 when you had few people waiting for tables....we had an amazing dinner at Gianna Via's as a result. Food was better, food was cheaper, service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Armstrong's Has really left alot to be desired lately. Have eaten here many times but our recent valentines day visit was less than desired and so was our previous visit. The tomato sauce tastes like metal and the chicken parm (if you can call it that) is bland at best. Eat n park is better and that's not saying much.   I brought this to management attention immediately and they honestly did not care and wrote me off with a credit. I would think this establishment would care MUCH more about their food quality as it's flavor. Sorry guys, but I will be eating Italian at an Olive garden or Carbonaras. Armstrong's really needs to revisit their methods of preparation and food consistency. Because it has proven to be noting but consistently BAD"}
{"text":"Not all that long ago, Kay and I lunched at the Armstrong's west of Pittsburgh and were unimpressed (look up my review). After my disappointment of a lunch, I lamented my decision not to simply order a steak. I usually avoid steak at restaurants for two reasons: (1) They tend to be overpriced. (2) They usually don't cook them quite the way you'd like them to be cooked.   It had been years (pre-Yelp) since I last patronized the South Hills Armstrong's, and considering that we had some shopping to do in the area today, Kay and I allowed ourselves to be captured by this venerable restaurant's suburban charm. More than a mere diner, Armstrong's blurs the line between casual and formal somewhat, finding a middle ground betwixt a family-style chain and a steakhouse. Their menu that ranges from pasta and seafood to sandwiches and digitally-held munchies. Framed pictures of Pittsburgh landmarks hang on the walls. While we dined, an amicable, opinionated, and witty bartender could be overheard and seen entertaining regulars, and elderly women in festive attire hooted and hollered at a flatscreen television while watching the Steelers take on the Dallas Cowboys. Having described Armstrong's, it could be thought of as either an Eat 'n Park for the upper-crust or a Ruth's Chris for the paupers such as myself.   Yes, yes, yes, the path of sirloin was certainly the proper one to take as my choice took me towards a divinely juicy, egregiously tender, enormously tempting 7 ounce hunk of gloriously broiled steak (on a bed of...toast no less!) that I had with twins of peachy crab-stuffed shrimp, a luscious, steaming baked potato, and a salad dressed with a housemade buttermilk ranch.    Slathered in nothing but supple mushrooms, applying steak sauce to this bodacious, medium-rare slab of beef would have been a crime against gastronomy. It...bled as I carved it effortlessly, chewed it...effortlessly, relished it, ravished it...effortlessly. What other steps beside seasoning and grilling does one need to take in order to prepare steak of the highest order? Scorched on the exterior, bloodshot internally, I kept slicing against the grain and devouring, until sadly, there was no more.   Men, this was a steak for all time, and it was had without wearing expensive clothes, eating on silk tablecloths, or having to make a reservation. If Ditka's has a relatively affordable cousin, it is Armstrong's.   It's also housed in a suburban shopping center. Let that mill about in your minds for a few minutes.    P.S. For dessert, I had a piece of their Chocolate Banana Swirl pie and found it merely adequate. They were out of the Buckeye Cake, which is what I initially wanted.  P.P.S. Kay's linguini with clam sauce was above average.  P.P.P.S. The salad dressing was passable albeit watered down a little.   P.P.P.P.S. Bonnie, our server, was a trip and doted on us as if we were her kids. God love her."}
{"text":"We love Armstrongs! The food is consistently delicious and the portions are very generous. The best part is their desserts. They make them in house and they could beat any other local bakery! You have to go over the weekend to have the best selection and I always order my dessert first as I've learned that they can sell out by the time I'm finished with my meal."}
{"text":"Everyone I know raves about this place and for me, its just meh. Probably because I can't find anything I really love on the menu and its kinda greasy like Whitney B. says.   The pasta servings are huge and you'll get at least three meals out of it. I do like their chicken wings - we usually order from here for big gatherings and everyone loves them.   What I do love, is you're treated like family here and I like supporting local businesses that treat you right."}
{"text":"Great food for the price accompanied by super service.  Lots of choices on the menu - something for everyone.  Only the second time I had been there, first was a few years ago."}
{"text":"Armstrong's is one of my favorite restaurants! Located in the Caste Village shopping center, you are sure to find parking somewhere near by and I have never had to wait to be seated. The food is delicious and they serve up big portions at a fraction of the cost of other big name restaurants! And if you are ever feeling the desire to go all out, do not hesitate to indulge on one of their amazing desserts! I recently ordered the Heath bar cheesecake and it was amazing- smooth, delicious and full of chocolate and butter toffee flavor. By far, the best cheesecake I've had- better than Cheesecake Factory and much cheaper! The ambiance is great. It's dim indoors usually, unless the sun is shining through the ceiling window. The staff is friendly and the service is great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a big meal with a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"We don't come here often, but when we do, we always enjoy it.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired (very blah and outdated), but the food always makes up for it!  Great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Classic place.. Best Caesar salad I've ever had, always crunchy and the dressing is so yummy. From the appetizers to the entrees down to the ranch this place will not let you down!! The monthly martini is always delicious too :) and also a great beer selection!! Friendly staff and always leave feeling full and happy !"}
{"text":"Armstrong's has great food. Every time.   The portions are enormous, the servers are friendly and warm. If you chose to sit at the bar to eat, expect to strike up a conversation with one of the great bartenders or friendly patrons. Expect a wait on the weekends, but it's worth it. The prices are reasonable and the food is terrific. It always smells amazing when you walk in and you can be sure that you will get your sauce and cheese fix when you are there."}
{"text":"First visit, I ordered the salmon,it was a big portion and cooked to perfection! Our server was friendly. I would definitely stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Caste Village shoppes is an old standby of mine called Armstrong's. This place is very popular so expect long lines especially around dinner. They do offer a take out menu if you prefer to call ahead and order.  They have a lunch menu. Portion sizes are huge! I was eating here with my family so we decided to have an appetizer of wings. Finger licking good. I went with chicken parmesan where you get two chicken breasts and choice of two sides. I took the pasta and a salad which is a small upcharge. Most menu items comes with a choice of two sides. My son had the steak bistro sandwich, and my daughter had the turkey club. Course they serve you plenty of bread as well so if you can't finish it there's always the doggie bag.   My chicken parmesan was moist and tender and I loved the sauce that went with it. The rest of the crew seemed pleased with their meals. Since we had so much food there was no room for dessert but I see they just changed the dessert menu out.    Prices here are very reasonable for meals and it is a great hidden hideaway tucked towards the end of the shoppes in the Caste Village strip mall."}
{"text":"I went here for my in-laws anniversary dinner. I will say they do very good business. We were told a 35 minute wait and it took us an hour before we were seated. The atmosphere is nice. Parking is a bit of a problem during dinner time.   Everyone seemed very satisfied with their meals. I got a burger and it was very well done. I am a medium cooked burger kind of guy so this is why I gave it 3 stars. I did eat it but it was not all that tasty.   The waitress was attentive and checked in on us plenty. I think I also hyped this restaurant up in my mind by all the good things I have heard. Unfortunately, that was not my experience."}
{"text":"Armstrong's is the place to go if you're looking for a home-cooked meal outside of your own home. Situated at the end of a strip mall, Armstrong's location offers plenty of parking spaces, which is often needed during those peak dinner times. At those times you can expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.   The large dining room is a mixture of booths and tables with enough space between each to avoid feeling cramped. There's also a decent sized bar area enough to seat 15-20 people.   The menu offers a wide array of options from salads to soups and sandwiches to steaks. Regardless of what you order, you will likely end up with a to-go box - the portions are quite large."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced $12 for a fish sandwich...and they expect a tip for turning around and pulling your bag off the rack."}
{"text":"Oh my. Another Pittsburgh staple and there's a reason for it. Everything on the menu is a heavenly taste of Italy. Actually more than a taste because the portions are enough to feed a family of six. Of course I exaggerate but they are very generous. Love their meatballs and the chicken parm is one of my frequently ordered dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great prices. I hadnt been there in years but found it again this past weekend and the food is still just as good as ever and the portions are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the crab balls, order them with the honey mustard dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Totally so so. I supposed this is a staple of the Burgh but I don't think I've been here before. The food was literally average quality. I had an OK burger and the fish sandwich looks like the same one everywhere else has. My mum had the mac&cheese which looked great, and I was impressed by the seasonal craft beer selection.  Other than that, it is very average and there are way yummier places nearby to have lunch."}
