{"text":"Asked for extra spicy and got extremely bland food.

Service was very slow as well. Naan came out after majority of the meal was already finished."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet.  Not very good.  The food was bland.  Most Indian buffets are not very good so my expectations were not very high.  I still was hoping very much that this place would be a hidden gem.  Unfortunately it was less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant yesterday for the first time, and we'll never go back. I should have left as soon as the waiter apologized when he handed me a torn up copy of their take out menu which was being held together by pieces of scotch tape, and said, \"I'm sorry sir, but this is our only copy of the take out menu\". In any case, the food at Indian restaurants falls largely into two categories -- really good or disgusting; the food at this restaurant falls firmly into the latter category. The Aloo Gobhi tasted like it had been sitting in a wok all day; the malai chicken looked and tasted like boiled chicken not succulent pieces of chicken coming out of a tandoor. The raita was salty enough for me to want to throw it onto my driveway to melt the snow, and the Kashmiri chicken was greasy.  My prediction -- I give this place 6 months. My advice -- don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Fresh and quickly prepared. Exquisite balance of spices. Just what the doctor ordered on a cool September night. 
Not exactly buzzing, but it is a Wednesday. 
The menu is quite simple, not cluttered with a lot of options. Would have liked to see a mango lassi on there, for the kids' sake. But my lamb vindaloo and aloo gobi with garlic naan was great. Very healthy portions."}
{"text":"We wanted to have the dinner buffet but was disappointed to find out this was no longer offered except during lunch. The waiter had no idea when the dinner buffet was no longer offered as he was new. 

We resigned ourselves to ordering from the a la carte menu. We were happy to see that they had chicken korma Kashmiri on the menus along with a basket of 4 different types of naan which we have eaten at other Indian restaurants. 

The food took forever to arrive and when it did, we were presented with 3 curries but had to wait some more for the rice and another two dishes to arrive. When the rice arrived the food was getting cold and still the naan did not.  That was another few minutes wait. 


The food was good, especially the butter chicken and the chana masala. However we did not like the chicken korma, as it didn't have much flavour to it. Sort of had the Campbell's cream of mushroom soup consistency to it. 

Including us, there were 3 tables of patrons being served by one waiter on a Sunday night. The other guy, probably the owner's son or relative, sat by the entrance and did nothing to help the waiter except play with his phone the entire hour and a half that we were seated.  The waiter never stopped by to refill our drinks or water glasses until at very end when we hunted him down. 

Over all the food was good but they should stick with the buffet concept as they obviously can not handle a sit down type of set up. At least with the buffet, all they have to do is to replenish the food and pick up the dirty dishes. 

We will not return for a sit down meal except maybe to take the food to go as they seem to now offer this as part of their menu. 

I wonder how much longer they will be around though."}
{"text":"Finally!  Good Indian resto in Oakville.  Just opened 2 weeks ago.
Tastefully decorated with a modern flare.   A great selection on the buffet ranging from apps to mains and three kinds of sweets plus fruit and ice cream for dessert.  They also bring fresh naan to your table.  Service was friendly. 

All the dishes were tasty.  Buffet was $19 pp.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I'm glad there is finally a nice Indian restaurant in Oakville. We tried the chicken biryani, butter chicken and vegetable pakora. All the dishes were very good. The portions were also a good size. The basket of naan was delicious. I could just eat that alone. The service was prompt and she was very helpful with the menu. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So this place opened up recently. Its really clean the servers r nice the food is fresh and not that spicy the price is reasonable and i would def go back."}
{"text":"This location used to be a Shoeless Joe's and I believe another restaurant before that and all of which have had very little success.  I am beginning to wonder if this location is cursed, and unfortunately Tandoori Cook House does little to alleviate that concern.

Honestly, I was excited to try this place, as it was relatively new however I was rather disappointing.  First the positives, the renovations to the inside transforming it from the old restaurant to the current one are very well done, and the restaurant appeared clean.  However, the restaurant was not very busy, and this was on a Saturday evening around 6:00pm.

The food itself was very average at best, and the amount of choices available seemed rather limited for a buffet.  None of the dishes really stood out and I was not really interested in going back for seconds.  Secondly, the price is very high, especially considering the quality of the food and number of options.  Overall, its not very good value for your money, and better Indian food can likely be purchased elsewhere for less."}
{"text":"We have only bee here twice as it is quite new.  We're pleased by the section and presentation of the buffet  Good food plenty of choice nice atmosphere and friendly staff who actually engage in conversation with you which is welcoming. The owner requested feedback as he wanted to improve as it was still in shakedown but it was really quite good not requiring change"}
{"text":"Driving back from a long weekend holiday in the Golden Horseshoe, tastebuds started asking for some good ole indian food. Based on our location and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers, decided to try out this place and the lunch buffet...Big mistake.

Decor- this place looks modern and has a nice feel to it. Its clean, although i didn't see any indian decor or feel any indian ambiance.

Value- the lunch buffet was 21.99+tax! Yikes! I don't mind paying good money for good food, but as you will read below the food was just not up to par. 

Food- with the exception of a few items such as the lamb kebob, chicken tikka, the rest of this buffet can be forgotten. Why did the goat biryani have no goat only rice? Why when asked to refill the tandoori chicken did it take half hour only to get pieces which looked dry and reheated? Why is the papad dry and not crispy? The whole buffet was just bland and not fresh at all

Maybe they had an off day? But at 21.99 the price didn't! I wouldn't try this place again."}
{"text":"It was okay and there was really no one there. The food wasn't all that but it serves the purposes so can't complain too much. Would probably try another place before coming back here"}
