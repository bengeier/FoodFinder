{"text":"Honestly, a cave has more appeal.  As bikers, we are always willing to try out new, out of the way places, in hopes of finding a place that is biker friendly. This is not the place. In fact, its not friendly at all. The long haired hippie behind the bar making drinks told the guy beside us that he would \"f*#king get to his sorry @ss as soon as he FELT like and if he didnt like it to go find someplace else\".... We did. Dont waste your time here, as its nothing but local drunks, served by local drunks...its the kind of place you might get killed in, but not served in."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall but a great atmosphere. the people were friendly and their sweet potato fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a very small neighborhood bar without a lot of bells and whistles.  This is just how I like it.  The owners are very nice and always willing to make my special recipe drink.  The karaoke on Friday nights is fun.  The host has a great selection.  So far he has anything I've ever asked for.  They have bands on most Saturday nights (karaoke when no band is scheduled).  It's very crowded when a band plays, as in the band takes up half the bar.  But the bands are always good.  I hear there is an open mic night on Wednesdays but I have never been.  The drink prices are more than fair.  They have 2 pool tables in the back.  The clientele there are always very friendly and welcoming.  I made \"friends\" my first night there.  Like I said, don't go expecting to find anything fancy.  But I love small, no frills and fun and this definitely is it. OH, and the food is good, too!!"}
{"text":"Edited to add: every night is a different atmosphere! Thursday nights are pool tournament nights? It's a serious atmosphere but not bad! Customer Service still great.  Small, Hole in the wall but fun! Has 2 pool tables, a bar, few tables and a patio. Definitely would describe as \"intimate.\"  As someone who just moved to the area, I'm trying to find places where I can have a low key kind of night...and boy is this the place! I was a little hesitant to enter an obvious drinking establishment alone as young woman of color but Everyone at the bar was friendly (without too many creepy people in the mix) and drink specials were cheap. The food is just okay but free Karaoke on the Saturday I went made up for it.  They have bands on other Saturdays and other things during the week as well.  I definitely would go again and recommend to people who aren't looking for anything fancy."}
