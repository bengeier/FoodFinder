{"text":"We discovered this place by complete accident. We were at an offspring concert and these were the only guys that were open towards the end of the show. And all they had left were chicken tacos.. and I couldn't be happier it worked out that way. I've been on the hunt for good chicken tacos in town and this place is the best I've had in a really long time! There's no competition whatsoever. As part of our Taco Tuesday dinner, we stopped by their truck at Boondocks in Old Town. We ordered the Nitro Nate, Benny D with chicken, Pineapple Pete and elotes. Lucky for us, they had something called Christmas Elote which had chipotle crema and cheeto dust. Each taco was spectacular! Benny D was a touch too spicy for my taste but I would order it again.. the flavors were dynamite! Nitro Nate was absolutely fantastic as well and my friend really enjoyed the Pineapple Pete taco as well. Street corn was incredibly flavorful and on point. Most taco places focus on carne asada or pork tacos because they are generally more popular among people. Owing to this fact, chicken tacos always seem like an afterthought at most places.. These guys completely broke the stereotype. They put a lot of heart and love into their food and it is evident with each delicious bite. Boondocks is a 30 second walk from where I live. You know where I'll be for round two of tacos every Tuesday!"}
