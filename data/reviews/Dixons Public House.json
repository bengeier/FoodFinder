{"text":"What happened to this place?  Just 2 years ago I lived in the area and would come to Dixons at least twice a week and the food was outstanding! Last weekend we decided to venture down here for a long overdue visit and I was excited to get one of my favorite meals.  What a disappointment. Their food has taken a serious downgrade. Everyone at our table was disappointed with their meals. What started as A+ pub meals now looks like middle school cafeteria food.  The only positive was that the service is still excellent."}
{"text":"Dixon's wing night for only 0.25 every Monday! Want to try a new wing place then come on down to Dixon's, with 28 flavours to choose from you can't go wrong.  No I'm not promoting or advertising Dixon's I'm just sharing what I know. My overall experience was great to be honest since the past reviews everyone talked about a couple of flaws when they visited. Yes it's busy and yes you will wait. It IS a pub, what did you expect? Fast service? If you want fast service then just go to a fast food restaurant, KFC is just across Dixon's so if you're in a rush they do have wings (and other variety of chicken) available although it's just one flavour.  I prefer Dixon's for wing night Monday's over other pubs and restaurants in the SW/SE and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We frequent the sister pub, Seanachie's in Signal Hill often but this was our first visit to Dixon's Pub. Same menu and daily specials. Same noise level as you would expect with dozens' of TV's broadcasting sports events. Always popular with us, Wednesday special, of wings or the Big Pub Burger. This burger is delicious and normally sells for $13.75 but only $5.00 on Wednesday, as are their in-house Gas Lamp craft beers. Amazing value & great meal for $10!"}
{"text":"A friend an I came here looking for a simple breakfast and ended up waiting forever for a really substandard meal that didn't have enough food and was partially burnt. I don't recommend Dixons at all. The waitress didn't seem happy to be working there at all. My friend spilled his coffee and she ignored us. We used our napkins to clean it up and she didn't bring us new napkins for our meal and then acted as though it was an inconvenience to her day to split the bill between us. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Well the menu is the exact same as Limericks... y'all read my review on that,  so I was skeptical. My friend got the fish and chips because she can eat anything and not gain a pound. I got the shrimp and avocado wrap with a side salad.  It was good, but there should be a lot more shrimp and a lot more garlic. not so much tomato and lettuce. I know its filler and all but really, there was maybe like 10 shrimp in the whole massive wrap. I was pleased that the kitchen got it right and put my mayo on the side.   My friends fish and chips on the other had were pretty much a thin strip of fish with a gigantic amount of fried batter around them, so she had a lot more to cut off then eat. Her fries were good though. not soggy or anything. Will probably go back because it is the closest bar to her house."}
{"text":"We had the best server, I have had in years. I am a reviewer not by trade but by need to help others enjoy life. We, my friend M, my (K) friend and I went there for dinner at 6:30 ish, on a Saturday night July 30, 2016, were greeted by her. It was K's birthday. She oyr server, was very open and accommodating, saying to the ladies lets start with drinks, when they were not sure, offered coffee, water etc, my wife said we were looking for Bellinis.  Amy, I found out, was her name, suggested several, so the choice was Peach instead of strawberry. Yum. I had the coke as designated driver.  Next was food. The list was great but I went for safe choice on food, just a regular burger? Wrong, it not regular, its big. It can be made with various choices. My friend took the fried egg as a topping, yes.  I had the Sauteed mushrooms as well.  Amy was good, asking questions like Yolk side up or down, etc, on my Burger I got multi grain bun.  I had wanted whole wheat but loved this choice.  M, ordered Chicken Quesadilla as a starter but woah, its huge, its a meal. Also it has lots and lots of Chicken in it. She has had it at some known restaurants, ie the One starting with D (Franchise chain, various locations) and a sports bar starting with S (named after sea fish) and neither of those have even 1/3 the amount of chicken in it,  Names of competitors were left out. It serves no reason to name them.  Dixon's out did everyone.  My Burger was better than that of Five Guys, Gal and Fries place.  I am thinking if this is their regular style of menu, I will be eating here more often.   Our total was under $70.00.  Amy our server checked on us several times, refilling the drinks, Coke and coffee, offering Mayonnaise for fries for my friend.  She said it was her second shift so I was nervous on bill, you know  having to ask about corrections, no, I did not need it. When members of my party wanted to split bill, I refused, sent them to VLT's where they made money, Amy took it as a sign to give me the bill quickly, paid for it, so the others would not see bill.  Ralph, Wheres the Bill? Oops it got soaked then destroyed, but its paid so you cannot share bill, ha ha. Guys This is how its done.  Amy was so professional, so sweet and not using her looks to sell food. She told us about the different foods, how some of them tasted, how big they were.  About us: I am a very cautious eater, always checking ingredients etc for dietary and medical reasons, M is a person whom loves to try foods, but nervous about prep, K is a seasoned restaurant food eater.  I wrote this long review so you understand everything was awesome.  I will go there again soon and will post again so you can see its not a 1 time excellent dinner.  The tv at table had UFC on screen, so it was a topic of sorts, we did not like the matches but that's opinion. You could put menu in front of screen to block show.  I felt very good about tonight's dining experience.  I left full (stomach) from just the burger and fries, this was unusual. I had no space for the desert, Apple Pie, which is like a slab in size. This is unusual."}
{"text":"Tried a few weeks ago, mid afternoon pretty quiet.  Server was attentive too our table, was never over top of us but always new when to come by with another round of drinks.  The Dry ribs were excellent and I tried a boxty item,  a stew in a potato pancake wrap was very tasty as well.  Will try again."}
{"text":"It's a pub, like all pubs don't go expecting 5 stars.  Food was great, drinks were well made. The table and chairs though are sticky, our waitress slow but very considerate and accurate.  The TV beside you where you can play along as you go, isn't actually the case. Downloaded the app and it was two different games!   The whole franchise is iffy. The good staff tend to leave quickly to better places."}
{"text":"I do love this place, awesome atmosphere, cold delicious beer and wicked fried pickles!."}
{"text":"Personally, this place reminds me of home. Relaxed, casual and Irish (ish). A typical pub, with the usual pub food including beef stew and the best mulligatawny soup. The food is ok, the service is quick. A excellent place to sit and catch up with friends. Lots of television screens so watching the ice hockey or UFC fight is comfortable, but get there early it gets busy and there is usually a cover charge. A local pub on the outskirts of Calgary."}
{"text":"This to me and my friends has been the official \"I just turned 18 it's time to get DRRRRRUNNNK\" local pub. It's been around as far back as we can remember with our beer marinated collective mind.  Their beer selection is ok and one can certainly get their usual favourites in a pint, rather than the usual bottle served from the ice bin of a tub-girl, not that I'm insinuating that this is a club, it's an irish sports pub. They cover major sports games and will do the usual cover charges for fights.  Their menu somewhat mirrors other pubs under the same ownership like limericks, but lately I have noticed some variances between the two places.  To be honest I haven't been here in over a year, but we've gone SO MANY times, I still deploy a gag-reflex every time someone suggests going here. How many times can you drink from the same glass? how many? Answer dammit!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Dixons because it has been in the community for such a long time.  I love that it has a separate upstairs room that you can use for birthday parties or larger group gatherings but you must have at least 30 people attending your event to get to use it.  I also am a fan of this pub because of what they have done for students. St. Mary's University is a local University in south Calgary that is close by and the students recently go to this pub so if students show their school ID they get a percentage off which I love!  Thank you Dixons :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here a long time. Still feels like home. Great service and food. Breakfast is choice also."}
{"text":"I went this evening for a friend's party. There was between 5-9 of us at any one point just depending on who was leaving and joining etc. etc.   We arrived and she checked our IDs which is something that no matter how busy she was she was super diligent about throughout the night. We hadn't quite looked at the drink menu so we just ordered waters to start. It took our waitress 15 minutes to bring us 2 glasses of water. We ordered our drinks (mojito and blue Hawaiian), along with an order of the sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries came out after around 15 minutes, yet there were still no alcoholic beverages on the table. 5-10 minutes later we have our drinks in our hands. We couldn't decide if we wanted anything else to eat to so we took another 10 minutes and finally chose to just each get a dessert to eat (sticky toffee pudding and a mud pie). We ordered them the next time the waitress came to the table and it took around 45 minutes for us to receive them. Unfortunately either the waitress or the kitchen has messed up which type of pie had been ordered so we ended up with Apple instead of mud. The waitress didn't come back to check on us so another girl at our table just decided to eat it and we ordered another mud pie around 10-15 minutes later. After another 30 minutes we finally get the mud pie. It was good but not really worth the wait. My friend ordered another water but again it took another 20 Minutes and by the time it arrived we had decided to leave. Instead of waiting for our bills we just passed off some money to our friends who were staying later so that we wouldn't have to wait any longer.   Food quality wise, the mojito was probably the worst mojito I had ever had. It was bitter, and tasted simply like rum, water and mint. That being said I did drink the whole of it and it probably could have been worse. Nevertheless I did not order another one. The sticky toffee pudding was tasty but there wasn't enough things happening on the plate for it to have warranted a 45 minute wait. Simply put it was cake in a pool of toffee with squirty cream on the side. When we finally got the mud pie it was rather disappointing, it was like an ice cream cake from Dairy Queen, nothing special or out of the ordinary.   I would not recommend this bar to anyone else. The wait times for things were far too long and no management or servers apologized for us waiting once. The food was good, but not outstanding just average pub fare. And the mojito was understated and disappointing. I felt as though we were thoughtfully ignored throughout the night and our server missed countless steps of service  Never. Again."}
{"text":"Pretty much average all around. The menu is the basic, the beer is the basics plus a handful of craft stuff, the food is good and there is PLENTY of it. It seemed fairly clean when I went and the waitress was slightly above average in terms of friendliness, about average in service. I would recommend for just a basic night out with some friends, but only if you are somewhat nearby. The only thing to avoid is the fish and chips. I, and several others, have had bad experiences with that item. It is almost all batter and greasy all the way through."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and don't have high expectations at this point. It's near where I live, and the food is good, so we find ourselves here every so often. But we don't often have good service; it can take a while to receive your drinks, then your food, then your bill, etc. Every time I come here it seems they block off half of the bar for a \"reservation\", but no one ever seems to show up for it. I think they do this so they don't have to clean the whole place when they close up. The food is good though, so if you're feeling patient and want a good pub burger, Dixon's would be my recommendation!"}
{"text":"I was in town the other day and met up with a friend. We decided to check this place out and was not disappointed.   I ordered a few beers and a poutine and my friend did too. The poutine had real cheese curds which were great and the gravy and fries were also very good.   The atmosphere was that of a place you stop in for a few drinks or supper with good friends. The service was good as well. I'll be back next time I'm in Calgary"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is never good. Waitresses are rude, slow, and never seem to be around when you need anything. Also they change there menu prices about once a month. Don't get too used to any specials because before you know it the price changes or they don't have it. Business needs to be managed better. Goes for all Calgary's Best Pubs."}
{"text":"Came here for wings night monday - $0.19 / wing. and Schooner special too.  SOOOO BUSY! actually surprisingly busy. some wings were served room temp and almost cold :( and some wings looked skinny... ? haha  Maybe I'd come back, but most likely I would just try other places first."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for wings!! She moved up by here but it is far for us to travel! I love the atmosphere as it has something for everyone! A fireplace for a little romance! T.V's for sports, and also some trivia! I saw buck hunter game as well! Large pub with ample seating but packed on wing night Mondays!!  The wings were okay, I had Parmesan herb which were a bit bland, had red ale which were okay, and I tried my friends honey hot which were my favourite! Hubby ordered chipotle mango which were a spice not a sauce, I didn't like them! Drinks on happy hour I had a highball choices for cocktails not great, but they do have bulldogs in a variety of flavours! It looked good! Service was good for how busy she was! But did do her best!! Brianna was her name"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: This review is strictly for their Monday 14 cent wing night.  My friends and I wanted a quick bite after sporting Monday night and we stumbled upon this place tucked in Shawnessy. Fortuitously, they were having a Monday night special and wings were 14 cents each! According to our server, we were technically limited to 20 wings/drink but she let us get away with 30. We were off to a great start.  Environment - Dixon is a pub and it felt exactly like one. It was busy but not completely full at 8pm. We found a table quickly. The place was clean with TVs at almost every angle (although admittedly, we were sitting close to the centre).  Food - The wings were solid. Hot, crispy, and normal-sized. It did not feel like I was eating wings from a malnutritioned chicken nor from a chicken on 'roids. Sauces were good and some were quite unique. For example, the Sweet Asian Ginger was a favorite. The Philippine Poblano Pepper sauce, however, was bland. My drink was the Gas Lamp Blonde, which was decent but nothing spectacular to write home about.  Value - This is where Dixon's scores big brownie points. I was not expecting much from the wings due to their price, but they were very good. They seemed to actually care about the quality of the food, despite it being discounted and being served at a busy time. Compared to the wing nights at other establishments, Dixon's blows them out of the water.  Overall - If Dixon's wasn't so far for me, I would make this place my regular Monday joint."}
{"text":"I like this place for its food and ambience. It's a dirty place at times, with sticky floors drunk slurring breath and smokers hanging outside. It's a pub! And for a pub, I think it's great. I give it three stars because as many times as I have gone to Dixons it doesn't really stand out as a great fabulous experience. It's okay. It's acceptable. I'm glad it's there, but I wouldn't go out of my way to give it crazy accolades.  The food is good. There are a lot of beers on tap. You can order house wine no problem or even shots if you are so inclined. The service is good. The servers work hard. This place is always packed. Especially at night.  I had a better time I think one time on a Sunday afternoon. The game was on, the sun was shining and the food was okay."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Love the atmosphere and the nautical theme of this place. Awesome food as well, highly recommend the Stuffed Bacon Cheddar Burger as well as the Salt and Pepper Calamari. Servers are reasonably quick and quite friendly. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for drinks with friends in the past.  The place is showing it's age and so are the staff. Dixons is ok for a couple beers if you really don't hve any other options."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff are friendly and caring, the food is delicious and the gas lamp beer is cool and refreshing"}
