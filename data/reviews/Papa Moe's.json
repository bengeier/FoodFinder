{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but this was a pretty sad experience.  

1.  Poor customer service.  Very slow service.  I went when Leela's was closed.  There was a lineup of people waiting to pay.  It seems the kitchen could only handle 2 rotls / 10 mins.  soooo huuungrryyyyy .

2.  False Advertising.  The til guy did not honor their outdoor advertisement for 3.25 roti.  He debated with customers, saying the prices had changed 4.25.  But really... change your outdoor sign and your indoor menu board to match!

3.  Although the flavors are nice, the ingredients have a high potato:meat ratio.  Where's the hero of the dish without meat?

4.  Was it bigger?  Was it better?   My friend ordered a large, while I ordered a small.  There was maaaaybe 1tbsp more filling in his roti, at a charge of $3 more.  I smell something fishy, and it ain't curried. 

5.  Rough around the edges ambiance.  Sticky tables, poor ventilation, bad tunes, and no working light in the washroom?  Papa Moe, whatever happened to setting the mood?

1 star for the low $ spent on my small roti.  Another star for the nice flavors.  I'll let you decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Great prices and food is always tasty.  We recently had the chicken fried rice, potatoe roti and chicken roti, with doubles.  Everything was made fresh and Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people.... Fast friendly family restaurant and always service with a smile

The jerk chicken, special fried rice and lunch specials are greatly priced and you get a lot of good food for the price, completely worth it!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs - a couple of weeks ago my mother (a senior citizen) went there and had a horrible experience that left her very upset and traumatized!

She placed an order and when she returned to pick up the order, the owner started swearing and yelling at her! She was so shocked at what was happening! Without even checking her receipt, he mistook her for someone who had already picked up the food and started calling her a thief! (Umm buddy, how about you check the receipt?? Isn't that restaurant 101???)

She was nearly in tears and feared for her safety :( But that's not all, he was not only verbally abusive towards her, he was a total racist. He said to my mom \"I know your kind, they are all thieves!\"- \"Your kind\", really ?? Seriously disgusting. 

And honestly the food isn't that great, go to Leela's next door and save yourself the potential abuse."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing quick friendly service. I love their stew chicken and Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"They don't seem to care if you eat there or not. Pretty crappy service. It's a dirty place with crappy decor. The floor in the kitchen is grimy. It's sad how low the standards are at these small places. You want to support them but you shouldn't."}
{"text":"Terrible roti, more potatos than meat. very small for the hefty large price. Flavourless chicken. Will never return."}
