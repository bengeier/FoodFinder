{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner for the first time but left disappointed. I was hoping to find another sushi place in this quadrant of the city to love, especially after seeing all the good reviews. We either went on an off day for them or the quality is going downhill. The service wasn't too great as we were basically ignored after placing our order and the waitresses weren't too attentive or friendly. 

We got a few giant rolls, a couple maki rolls, assorted tempura, and breaded oysters. The tempura was fresh and lightly battered, which was nice but nothing to write home about. Our rolls came next and that was where things started to go wrong. The hamachi was super fishy. I flagged down a waitress and told her about it, to which she asked me what I wanted her to do about it. I asked her what she could do for us and she offered to have it remade for us. A smaller serving of hamachi rolls came to our table and it was still super fishy so it was definitely not fresh. The other rolls were mediocre, not really flavourful or delicious although my mom complained that everything with fish in it was fishy. 

The breaded oysters were overcooked so they were dry and very chewy. At least they weren't fishy. Overall, we can't say we really enjoyed our meal which ended up being quite pricey. Most likely won't visit again, especially not for sushi."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most authentic and best sushi places in town if you are looking for the \"real\" deal. Place has very limited sitting so it's best to book in advance unless you are willing to wait. The dinner combos are the best bang for the buck. Loved Chef's sashimi assortment."}
{"text":"I heard this place is the sister restaurant to zi pang so no wonder I liked it so much. It's a little pricey for sushi but it's worth it. Authentic sushi in the north is hard to find. The only downside to this place is that it's too small and mostly reserved for dinner."}
{"text":"There was a quite a nice variety of items on the menu to start off with, which is always great when it comes to sushi. I'd like to share that I had called ahead & enquired about vegetarian options. I was delighted that the chef had created an elegant, regular-sized, roll for me in addition to the avocado & cucumber mini-rolls, for which I was super impressed!

Although every plate brought out looked super delicious, I have to say that the most visually pleasing was the salmon & roe egg plate (see top image); The following were also ordered: miso soup; beef totaki; broccoli; veggie mix; both regular & fatty tuna, and salmon sashimi; soft shell crab roll; chicken combo; tofu salad; and a root veggie mix. There was so much delicious food.
All in all, it was a good experience. We give it a 4 out of 5. We will for sure be eating there again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went in once saw lots of seating and told us it was an hours wait. Came another time and the server poured coke all down my daughters back and apologized to my other daughter for dropping her coke. Still made us pay for the coke. Will never go back again!! Had to give a star to post review doesn't even deserve that."}
{"text":"This place has some really quality Japanese food and a wonderfully wide menu selection, both in terms of cold dishes and hot dishes alike.  You may find prices to be a wee bit on the higher side than some other places, but it's definitely worth what you're paying.  The portions are great and the sushi always tastes fresh--consistency has not been an issue to me with this place.  It's really a treat to have a sushi joint out here in the 'burbs that offers quality Japanese food.  You won't be disappointed by the sushi here, and the service is A-OK to boot!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for!
A little more pricey than some, but completely worth it! My fave sushi stop in the city!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, but call before you go to make sure they are open. We have gone multiple times only to find they are closed for various reasons including \"winter break\". This would be a 5-Star review if we had not been disappointed on multiple occasions by their random closures."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in calgary. The fish is always super fresh and excellent quality. They also have specials everyday. Their lunch combos are a great deal. Be sure to make reservations because they're very busy and usually packed."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner with a number of great choices for the non-sushi lovers. As a sushi lover, it was yummy and fresh!  Highly recommended. The lunch menu has tweaked my interest and I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and very tasty. Book a reservation for dinner however, they tend to get busy!"}
{"text":"Tried shashimi bowl. Was blown away by the freshness. I just came bak from japan a week ago too. This restaurant s very close to d standards in japan even though we dont hav direct easy access to d ocean here in Calgary. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service and nice atmosphere. Didn't have a reservation and even though they were busy, I was seated promptly. Food came quick and pricing was reasonable. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Called ahead and made a reservation for Omakase, Chef prepared an excellent selection. All sushi, sashimi, etc was fresh and of the highest quality. The atmosphere sitting at the sushi bar was great as well. They make some amazing food here! It was a pleasure to watch each creation. Thanks so much Roku can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch at roku with my friend. They have excellent and unique options for the lunch combos. I got sashimi and fried mackerel. It was delicious. The miso soup was perfectly flavoured - none of the super salty premade stuff that you find at other restaurants. The fried mackerel was light and flakey. Very high quality. Downside - no change table in the washroom for my baby! It's nice and open there. The presentation of the food was really beautiful. Price wise it is slightly higher than most lunch combos. I would like to try it again for dinner but I think I'll save it for a special occasion as it is slightly more expensive than my usual sushi joint. 

Side note - the owners daughter competed in Sochi 2014 for ski jumping!"}
{"text":"This time I came with my husband for dinner and had a mix of items off the menu and specials board. The specials, red tuna poke style, seared salmon belly sushi, and blue fin tuna sashimi were fresh and delicious, as was the kaki ponzu again. The rolls, however, were a bit disappointing... The 2 maki rolls, though fresh tasting, were in horrid shape! They looked like a person's first attempt at making sushi! Given the Japanese are known for exquisite presentation, I was surprised to see they served it looking like that! The large rolls had way too much rice in proportion to the stuff inside... Once again, no complaints about the quality of the fish and whatnot inside. Lesson learned: order hot foods, sushi and sashimi, but no rolls."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day!  A lot of the clientele are Japanese, so when they say it's authentic, it's the real deal.  They import their ingredients from Japan, and use a delicious combination of, I believe, rice vinegar and miso to make their rice.  The result is oy-shi (delicious!).  This is hands down the best sushi I have ever had.  One tip is to not put too much wasabi on your rolls.  The chef here puts wasabi in the rolls they should go in, giving you a truly authentic flavour profile.  There is a good of cold and hot food.  The service is also the best I've experienced.  All the service staff attend to your every need, not just your one particular server, though this is of course mostly the case.  One may think a five star rating should be reserved only for gourmet quality food, and it certainly deserves it.  If you have a hearty appetite, you won't walk out of here without a dent in your wallet, but with food and service, you often get what you pay for.  That being said, there are lunch and dinner specials around $25 each on the expensive side, and as low as $15.  I would not hesitate to avidly recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience the best delicacies you can eat on this side of the Pacific."}
{"text":"We decided on a late lunch at this popular Japanese restaurant in Royal oak after it was closed for a special function the last time we went.  After hearing some great reviews, I was excited to try!

Atmosphere: 4/5  The restaurant is not very big but neat and modern with a good decor and ambience.  It can get busy, but since it was the end of the lunch hour, we were seated quite quickly. There is the option to sit at the bar or tables.  It is conveniently located in royal oak mall with plenty of parking.

Food: 4.5/5 I love the variety of fishes and dishes here!  We went with the tofu salad, tuna avocado no goma ae, udon, and ordered white tuna, salmon, and unagi sushi a la carte.  There were so many options regardless of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, rice bowls, or grill / entree items.  Perfect portion size, fresh fish, and tasty salads without too much dressing.  I love the big piece of unagi in the sushi!  

Service: 4/5  Efficient and friendly service.

Price: 3/5  Reasonable

Overall: 4/5  Really great Japanese restaurant with a comfortable ambience and many delicious options on the menu.  I would definitely return to try some of their other fish."}
{"text":"I had heard about this sushi restaurant during my travels and while visiting Calgary, I made it a mission to find and try out Roku today.

They have a fresh fish menu with their current specials (fish flown in fresh from Japan) and different sets and combinations of sashimi that seemed fit to share for groups.  I inquired politely if they did Omakase style and was told that they did not.  I asked if I could just try one piece of everything that they had from Japan.  The lady said that yes, they would try. They said very humbly after some consultation with the chef that they would try to do an omakase for me and my friends!  I was excited! :)  They asked me politely what price range and I replied that price was not a concern and that I wanted to taste the best that they had.

Part of what I love about omakase is the experience and interaction with the chef.  Tsutomu-san was very quiet and humble and I asked if I could have a nigiri style sushi of every piece of fish they had from Japan.  I was presented with a beautiful platter of 8 pieces of nigiri.  Akami (blue fin), Chu-toro (blue-fin), Hotate from Hokkaido, Hirame (flounder), Hirame Engawa (flounder fin), Japanese Saba (one of my faves for texture!), Tobiuo (flying fish) and Isaki (grunt).  Fish was cut perfectly - generous in proportion and on rice that was so good I barely noticed it as it dissolved into the fish with every bite and chew. This chef has SUPERB skill in his hands for making nigiri and enhances the taste of each piece.  We took our time savouring each nigiri as the flavours lingered deliciously on the palate moving from the delicate white fish to the stronger flavours, finishing with the Chu-Toro.  

After I asked for a 5 more nigiri (fish not from Japan) - I asked specifically for Hirame Engawa Aburi-style (seared with a torch to give it a smokey flavour), Uni and Wagyu beef nigiri and asked the chef if he would match the other pieces to those strong tastes.  He rounded the order out with Hamachi, Sockeye Salmon which were all amazing!  My friends had never tried Wagyu beef (it's a specific breed of cattle raised in Japan) and before I go any further I have to state that I love beef and am proud of Alberta Beef.  I eat steak on a fairly regular basis (tenderloins blue rare and rib-eyes rare just so that the fat renders a bit more) and LOVE it!  Wagyu beef tastes different and a slice of it seared onto a perfectly pressed ball of zushi rice where the marbled fat has started to melt and drizzle down into the rice is a different class of ecstasy!  I enjoyed watching the expressions on my friends' faces as they experienced this for the first time.  The 3 pieces of 5 that I chose were all stronger flavours and the chef's choice to match Hamachi and Sockeye Sake (sha-kay) complimented my own selections perfectly.  

Still going strong, I asked for an Ikura (salmon roe) Temaki (cone), and asked if he could \"season it\" special - like he would want to eat it.  The cone was large, extremely generous amount of Ikura and rolled so that the Ikura was in EVERY bite of the cone (instead of just stacked on top like at some places).  He seasoned it with a full leaf of Shiso (Japanese mint-basil like plant) wrapped into the Ikura in the cone and sprinkled with toasted black and white sesame - the combination of the textures and tastes were incredibly enjoyable!  He matched it with a piece of Sake nigiri (Atlantic Salmon) - drizzled with Japanese mayo and seared aburi-style on his own initiative. The sweetness of the Japanese mayo seared into a carmelized crust while the Salmon was still blue-rare inside was a perfect counter-point to the saltier taste of the Ikura.  The seaweed of the cone was crisp, the Ikura had a pleasant \"pop\" and the sesame added a neat cruch - so following this up with the smooth soft nigiri was a textural shift that was genius!  I was seriously impressed! :)

I then asked for another piece of Uni nigiri (the sea urchin roe was from Vancouver Island - large, sweet and buttery - and so good I just had to have another piece!) and asked if he could match it with 2 other nigiri.  He made a trio of gunkanmaki.  The Uni was in the middle, flanked by Ankimo (monk fish liver) on the left and chopped Chu-Toro (blue-fin).  I wasn't sure about the Ankimo when I first bit into it, but as I started to chew it into the rice, the flavours came out and it was good!  The Chu-Toro tasted even better than before with the seaweed!

To finish the meal, Tsutomu-san created an Ikamentai Roll with shiso and chili when I politely asked for \"a roll to finish the meal with\". It was AMAZING!  A great way to end a spectacular meal! :)

Total cost was about $100 for me, including tip, no alcohol. Extremely reasonable for an amazing experience!

BTW - my friend who loves Spider Rolls ordered that and said it was the best Spider Roll he'd ever eaten!  He even shared a piece and I have to agree! :)

I made reservations for tomorrow already and look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi in the NW. Ambience needs a little work, but the food it top notch. We ordered ALOT so we figured out to stage our order next time.  They are very efficient at getting food out so our table was full in no time. Next time we will order a few things, and continue in stages. 
Go here people. If you like sushi, it's amazing. And it was great for me as I like some hot dishes also, and those were great too. I like a mix of hot and cold."}
{"text":"I was in town for two days and both of those days I had dinner at Roku (I had to come back).  Not only did they have fresh fish but also their portions were absolutely worth the bang for your buck. 

We ordered the gyu tataki to start and it was tender and the ponzu sauce really packed some flavor. We also ordered the salmon, salmon belly, and toro nigiri and this is where you really get the bang for your buck. The fish portion of the nigiri was more than generous and just melts in your mouth. The house special roll, chop chop roll, and negitoro roll were standardly made but nothing short of satisfying when it comes to the freshness of their ingredients. What I really appreciated the most other sushi restaurants don't do is that for the larger rolls they offer half orders, which encourages variety. We also had an order of the sweet shrimp (botan-ebi) and my favorite part is that once they take the heads off of the shrimp, they have the option of frying it up for you and let me tell you, that shrimp head tastes EXACTLY like those shrimp chips you get from the Asian market. It's sooooo crispy and a nice little treat with all the raw fish. Last but not least, the star of the night would have to be the green tea panna cotta. Just wow. I honestly came back for the dessert. I've had plenty of panna cotta and plenty of green tea flavored things but this was something I have tried for the first time. It wasn't too sweet but the little dollop of whip cream does help the dish out and a little hand from the ball of red bean (is what I believed it to be) was the perfect amount of sweetness. It was both rich but not overwhelming sweet; I loved it. 

The service was very friendly both times I visited and overall I would definitely come back and back and back again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out after hearing that it was authentic, but after trying a few items: sushi, tonkatsu, and tuna, I didn't find that it was anything special. I thought it would have a while difference flavor compared to other Japanese restaurants I've been to owned by Chinese. Other that the food, the atmosphere was nice and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Calgary. They are also quite gluten free friendly. Many items can be made gluten free....just ask. Their sushi rice doesn't have any wheat ingredients in it! Love their seared salmon special. The service is excellent and they are quite patient with children. Can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING!!  Clean, delicious, great servers ( waitresses, waiters ) not sure what's politically correct.
They care and are very respectful. I gave it a four star only because as I've mentioned  - I've heard you shouldn't give 5 Stars...??  But it is a 5 star in my books!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a weekday and their restaurant was busy but with tables that are empty that are reserved.  The restaurant itself is actually not small, but it looks like they are not too concerned about packing in as many tables as possible, which is not good for us as we were told that a 30-minute wait would be needed before a table is free unless we want to sit at the sushi bar.  Normally I don't have a problem with that except I was with my daughter and falling from a tall chair is not an option.  The server changed her mind after thinking things over and seated us at a table that has been reserved for sitting time just over an hour later.  Knowing how quickly we go through a meal, we know that it wouldn't be a problem.  Besides, another table would become available before then anyway... which was the case.

As this was the first experience, we were not too adventurous in our selection.  We ordered a Sushi Plate - Favorite, Tanuki Soba, and one of their dinner combo.  The food was very good and no complaints there.  I don't know if it is an off day on service, but they never come around to fill up our tea and water.  As for the ambiance, it can get loud in the restaurant but it didn't bother us too much.

Parking was all taken in front of the restaurant but the large parking lot located at an adjacent site to the west provided sufficient parking.  However, beware of all the stop signs at the end of every single aisle for all direction of travel!  It was highly unnecessary and confused the heck out of me!

To sum up, I think Roku is a great addition to the NW and I will come back for sure to try out the rest of their menu items."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Calgary.  My brothers and I eat here at least a couple time a week.  Always for lunch, only once for dinner, but it doesn't matter it's always good.  Staff is very friendly, the restaurant is always clean, the food shows the care and pride evident throughout this restaurant.  Prices are very good as the he quality is better than any place I've dined for Japanese cuisine.  My go to place."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Calgary. Not inexpensive, but worth it. Everything on menu is fresh and well prepared!"}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. But PLZ MAKE A RESERVATION! It's a small place that is very popular.
Their beef tataki, tacoyaki and udon are my favourite. Other plates are pretty good too.
Clean and organized place"}
{"text":"I dropped in here with hubby for lunch at 11:30am--we were greeted promptly and were seated at a table by the window. 
Although we glanced briefly at the sandwich board that listed the daily specials, the lunch combos on the menu were a good deal ($14-$16) for sushi/sashimi/izakaya with rice, miso soup and salad.  As more customers came in (this place fills up quickly), we noticed that they were all ordering the lunch combos(served from 11:30am to 2:00pm).
   Our server was pleasant, attentive, and very informative (I added \"izumitai (=white fish)\" to my vocabulary today).
Hubby ordered the Lunch Combo #1 and I ordered the Sushi Lunch.
Our miso soups were served piping hot.  Mmmmm....comfort food for me!
The salads were dressed in light vinaigrette and not doused with Thousand Island/Ranch dressing like most sushi restaurants.
   My sushi was very generously portioned and the freshest I've tasted.  Both tuna and salmon melted in my mouth and was served at the perfect temperature.  The sushi chef uses fresh ingredients, right down to the shiso leaf (they don't use plastic green leaves here) and the California roll (crab, avocado,fish stick) was carefully made.  The pickled ginger was pleasant to eat (not overly strong or pungent) and the presentation was impeccable.  
    We will be back to try some of the selections that are rarely offered elsewhere (e.g. sea bream, blue fin tuna, grilled whole squid, Japanese whiting)."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Calgary hands down. I was struggling to find a go to sushi place in Calgary ever since Wa's closed, and was so happy to find Roku. 

The sashimi here is amazing! Always super fresh and nice thick cuts. I like the udon here as well, and the special rolls are quite big. If you have room for dessert, I recommend the tempura banana with green tea ice cream. Soo good!

The service is also always great here. If you are going on a weekend, I recommend making reservations in advance because the restaurant is pretty small. I like that they didn't try to cramp in as many seats as possible and there is lots of space in between tables. 

I find that dinner can get pretty pricey as all sushi can in Calgary. If you are on a budget, I recommend going for lunch. They have some lunch specials that I find are great and cheaper. The sashimi lunch is my fav! :)"}
{"text":"Fish aside,  the rice is what makes good sushi.  Sushi masters in training work on making rice for a year or something before they get to touch ANYTHING else  (it might even be two...  I don't really have the facts in front of me) so it's obviously important.  I don't eat fish but I can tell you Roku has the best sushi rice of anywhere I've eaten in Calgary.   The downside for me is they have a more limited menu for fishless sushi than some of the other sushi places but they have the old standards and they are pretty good.  I also can't eat the miso which is also disappointing. 

Moving away from sushi they have some interesting other dishes like eggplant with tamarind sauce. Different, good but I'm not sure what I think of the texture.  Even still, it's not something i've seen elsewhere and is something I can eat so there is props for that.

Much of the staff speak japanese and are patient and indulge hubs as he's learning in preparation for an upcoming Japan trip.   Luckily they speak english to me as I'm completely lost.  :)

Lunch combos are a pretty good deal if you're not a vegetarian...  you can mix and match sushi and cooked food.  

Overall nice restaurant but the bill gets big quickly it seems."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place. We have been here a few times, and not only that its close to our place but it's a finer dining restaurant with a great selection of a la carte sushi. Love the Midori salad and the rainbow and house special rolls. It is our place to go for Jspanese!"}
{"text":"Roku has quickly become one of my favourite places to go for lunch. One thing I love is that the lunch menu has a large variety of dishes. It keeps you wanting to come back until you've tried them all.

The fish/sushi dishes are surprisingly fresh for the price, and the fried dishes are lightly crisped and not too oily.

If the great food and atmosphere wasn't enough, the staff and servers there are some of the friendly and attentive in the city."}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant! The sushi is very fresh and high quality. The servers are friendly and polite. The restaurant is spacious and opens."}
{"text":"Tried out a lunch special (sashimi with izakaya in a bento box, served with rice, miso soup and a small salad). I was impressed with the freshness, flavour, and presentation. The ambience is lovely, the service exemplary, and our meal was great value for money, something not to be taken lightly in a struggling economy. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find. Of course it is out in the boonies, but it is definitely worth the drive to Royal Oak for authentic and fresh Japanese food. I was pleasantly surprised with the lunch I had here during my business meeting -- chirashi done amazingly well (complete with a fresh Shiso leaf and beautifully shaved daikon) with some fresh fish and nicely prepared salmon teriyaki. Even the waitresses were Japanese! This is a gem to find in Calgary, a city that has constantly disappointed for good restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Calgary, possibly Alberta. Excellent rotating specials with unusual and interesting offerings are always worth a look on the menu board. It's always worth coming early before certain items sell out. Service is prompt, efficient and kind but could never be called overly friendly. You come here for the wonderful cuts of fish on top of warm, perfectly seasoned and textured rice. I've been a fan for some time and continue to drive the two hours round trip from Canmore and back or drop in whenever I'm headed to Edmonton."}
{"text":"Roku is delicious and WOW. So came here with a friend for dinner and the wait wasn't too bad. The wait was about 15 mins but well worth it. The restaurant isn't big. 

We ordered a-la-carte sushi. The pork belly salmon sushi/nigiri was my favorite. It was fatty and sweet. The Unagi sushi/nigiri was very good too. Big piece of unagi on the rice. The other sushi that we ordered like the salmon and salmon nigiri and masago scallop sushi. All very yummy. 

We also ordered the sashimi platter and it came with two pieces of salmon, two pieces of tuna, two pieces of scallop, two pieces of surf clam and two pieces of wild salmon. They were good. 

The seafood tempura wasn't bad but it was wow. Well at least it wasn't over cooked. I guess it has something to do with cooked fish with tempura combination. 

We also go the special of the day the wagyu beef and it was very delicious. I mean it was marinated very well. Only issue I had was that it was a bit too chewy. It also came with a nice dipping sauce. 

On top to end we got unagi on rice. I loved that. My friend who recommended this place the unagi on rice is a must try. They were very generous on the amount of unagi that was in the box. Very big portion.

This restaurant is located in a mall so there are plenty of free parking. 

I highly recommend giving this place a try. I personally enjoyed the atmosphere and décor."}
{"text":"Mehh nothing spectacular, fresh and good in general but I was personally disappointed. Lots of rice... Too much roe (like overdose!)... And quite expensive for take out. There is nothing wrong with the sushis, but nothing great either. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Roku is fantastic at one thing - making their food taste fresh. I'm not completely blown away by the overall flavours or the service for that matter, but this is actually really good sushi for a relatively decent price.

The hamachi is godlike by the way. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Such a calm environment, love the atmosphere here. Soft jazz music. I have found my new love. And his name is roku. 

It was so cute cause they brought around a white board with their specials of the day, and their chopstick covers had little fish on them (perfect to take home for bookmarks).

It was an absolute delightful lunch. We both opted to get lunch combos. And of course the bf had to try out their salmon as well. The portion sizes were great. The plating was pretty to look at and eat as well. All the sashimi tasted very fresh. And the tuna was melt in your mouth yummy. 

The miso soup was not overly salty and you could tell a distinct difference in their soup base. It tasted richly of fish/dashi. 

Food came out at an amazing time. We barley had to wait for any of it. The aki fry was delicious! I think i could've eaten another ten pieces of it if my appetite permitted. 

Will visit here over and over again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this neighbourhood resto as I've heard so many great reviews. Service was attentive. Sushi was fantastic. Melt in your mouth salmon that was the right temperature. Cool but not cold or frozen in my mouth. Rice was perfectly fluffy without too much vinegar. 

We tried the chicken karaage, tempura shrimp to start. Both were tasty, very crispy and lightly seasoned. A big bonus as I hate my food over salted. 

I had red tuna, unagi (BBQ eel), hokkigai (surf clam) sushi and red tuna and salmon sashimi. So tender and perfect!  Followed by spicy tuna roll and California roll. Good size portions for sure.

We will definitely return here again to try more items. The appies are extensive so I'm sure you could make a meal of it and they also have set menus for 2 or 3 people which takes the selection process out. Desserts look great so next time!"}
{"text":"Too good to be true. 
Server is always friendly. 
First dining experience was served by owner's son. 
Fresh materials and the dishes were given extra care. Better dedication than other sushi restaurant which I call the fast food sushi chain. Here I won't name them. 
Was a bit pricy but we were all willing to spend the money on the good food. 
They served us not just great food but also the spirit of Jan food"}
{"text":"I have been there for few times, love this place!

Roku is owned by the previous owner of Zipang, so both of them have the similar style. 

This Christmas, they offered All-u-can-eat menu on Dec 30th and 31st. Each table had 90 min to enjoy the food. But the booking was very full, so the first round started at 5pm, and the second around started at 6:30pm. Therefore, even if you were late , u still had to leave on time. We found this was a bit rush, especially my friend had to feed her baby at the same time. 

However, every time when my table placed an order, it only took few minutes; it was quick and awesome! The sushi (we love the yellowtail and tuna rolls so much!) and the hot dishes were good too!

About the service, they are always nice; but one of the staffs was just okay on Dec31st. We placed our first all-u-can-eat order, so when half of the food came, we asked for the order list and wanna prepare for the next round; but she didn't let us to have that and told us to wait until we finished the first round. And she was kinda pushy, hurry us to finish and leave. So we always got help from a nicer staff."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sashimi!  We had their blue fin tuna and salmon sashimi.  We also ordered the fiddlehead with their unique mayo sauce, a daily special.  The other dishes we tried were the kaki fry (fried oysters), plain soba noodles (big bowl), 2 dinner specials - fried chicken and the tempura - both dinners came with 2 appetizers (kind of a smoked salmon & sliced mushrooms), miso soup, a bowl of rice and a sushi plate - california roll (3 pcs), tuna sushi, yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi and prawn sushi.  Lot s of food but every items was done with such finesse!  A true Japanese gem in the Royal Oak area.

Interesting piece of decoration in the middle of the restaurant - a large golden rock with vines.  I asked the waitress what it was and she said it's an anthill!  I'm not sure what the significance of the ant hill is.

Great customer serivce!"}
