{"text":"Great little independent place - love the quality and ambience. Unique place - amazing crepes and delicious authentic coffee and cappuccino. Highly recommended for a change into something fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday. We ordered one savoury (mushroom melt) and one dessert crepe (maple syrup, banana, walnuts but since they ran out of walnuts they offered us a replacement topping. We chose strawberries).   Both crepes were delicious. I love the consistency and taste of the crepes. They weren't overly thick or thin, flexible enough to hold all the toppings without breaking. Eating crepes can be very messy sometimes but the way they wrapped the crepes made it very easy to eat without sauce dripping everywhere.   Another huge plus is the free toppings/alternate non-dairy milk options for FREE! Most cafes charge you more for ordering your coffee with non-dairy milk(soy or almond milk). Blinco's does not charge you extra, which is amazing.    The quality of the toppings were good. A fair amount and all were fresh. I would recommend my friends and family to come here."}
{"text":"Good choice of dessert or lunch/dinner/breakfast crepes and specialty coffee in a nice, brand new location. Jam crepes made with real Canadian jams. Very friendly staff. A bit hard to see from the road."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy, this is the perfect place for a casual weeknight or weekend get together with a friend or loved one. What could be better than coffee, crepes and board games?? I'm so happy my fiancée and I discovered this place - I know we'll be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"A gem of a place with very tasty and healthy food selection: crepes (chicken is to die for), Panini's and amazing coffee. Looking forward to my next visit to try their sweeter side of the menu!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. I was surprised at the prices for the quality. Great European coffee. Friendly staff. A refreshing experience in the Kipling area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I give it 10 since 5 is not enough. I would give it even more. Well, let's not rate this place at all. I don't think there is a score good enough for it:). Simply, \"welcome home\" for me. My grandma used to make pancakes like this and this man here who cooks, well I should call him grandma now. He took me back home, where food was great, smelled good and was healthy(using only best ingredients).The portion is just perfect, leaves room for the dessert too! Great interior too, very European. Love it, hope the owner likes me as he will be seeing me very often:)!"}
{"text":"Good food with a pleasant simple ambiance! Bring your newspaper and enjoy a \"snack crepe\" with your coffee! Crêpes & Paninis for your pleasure"}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening the place was empty and quiet. The service was fast (for cooked food). We had dinner crepes - one with chicken and one with mushrooms, both were good, crepes were not too fatty as in some other creperies. Then we shared one desert crepe with strawberry and Nutella, it was well decorated and the strawberries were thinly sliced. A good selection of teas, a good interior, mostly tables/chairs, but there are also two couches with a coffee table between them. Recommend."}
{"text":"Service, coffee and crepes were great! Had the mushroom melt, guacamole and beans and the cinnamon apple crepe."}
{"text":"Delicious! Not very busy when I came in today, but the server explained all the items and helped me pick which one. Had the \"One with the chicken\" lunch crepe and it was packed full. Coffee was good too."}
{"text":"So glad to have a crepe place in the neighbourhood again. Unfortunately, 3 dinner crepes came to over $30. Let's hope they're good."}
{"text":"Well this place is gonna get me in trouble. I keep coming back for their nutella covered crepes . Maybe today i ll change it up and go with the one with  tuna . Other than that i love the atmosphere and the friendly service"}
{"text":"Came to this place because of yelp reviews and was Not disappointed. Amazing crepes. I got a latte with almond milk which was really good too. They have card games and board games. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a neat little shop that has it all. Both the sweet and savoury crepes are well made with the crepes being fluffy and soft. They're folded up for the ultimate in portability making them perfect for on the go.   The sweet options are nice as it brings some seriously needed desserts to an area that is otherwise devoid of options for those with a sweet tooth.   If you're staying a while, kick back, grab a coffee and play a game of Jenga. There's even a couch or two if you're lucky enough to get it first."}
{"text":"I've noticed that crepes has been an item that's been popping up, around the city, whether they'd be at dessert places, cafés, food trucks, or entire restaurants that use crepes are a vehicle for sweet/savoury dishes!  Blinco's is another café located 1-1.5blocks away West from Kipling Station, in the same plaza as Swiss Chalet.  Actually, it's fairly easy to miss as the restaurant itself is NOT facing Dundas, but adjacent to it.  Easy to access parking lot if you're driving West on Dundas, but very tricky otherwise.  Unit is new and decor is clean and minimalist, chill atmosphere.  Lunch/Dinner crepes were $8.99, side salad was extra, but only +$1.50 for a tea/coffee with these crepes.  When you order, there is a list of free ingredients that you can add to customise your crepe.  And yes, they do sorta look like burritos...and taste somewhat similar as well.  I tried both the Beans & Guac + 'Stuff' (a bit of everything) and they tasted like burritos, but not as strong of a flavour profile, not as salty, and the crepe shell was nice and fluffy...what crepes should be!  Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu.  Crepe maker/owner was friendly!  The only down side to Blinco's is the location.  It's sorta in a transitional/commuter part of the city, not visible from the main street, and again, lot is difficult to access.  I can see it becoming more busy ones Kip District goes up!"}
{"text":"Blinco's Crepes & Coffee is a new cafe that just opened in Etobicoke on Dundas Street West. I was invited to come out to the grand opening but was unable to make it because I was in Montreal. However, I was able to come in and try their crepes after I got back. I brought my friend along and we both opted for the Decadent Crepes. I tried the Reese Crepes and my friend tried the Nutella & Peanut Butter Crepes. Both looked identical, hence I only chose to take a photo of my Reese Crepes.  I really like the price point of the crepes here because nothing is over $7.99. Usually when you think of a crepes place, such as Spin Desserts or Caffe Demetre, they usually cost over $10. The crepes are also very thin and minimal, perfect for those who can't handle too much sweetness. We also tried their Freddo, which is a mix between iced coffee and a Starbucks Frappuccino. It wasn't overly sweet like the crepes either, great for someone that doesn't want a sugar overload but still get their caffeine fix.  I think it is a cute option for a date night if you are in the Etobicoke area. They have a variety of tables and couches to chill out on and an assorted menu that will not break your bank!"}
