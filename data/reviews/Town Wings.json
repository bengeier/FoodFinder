{"text":"Verdict on this place: Meh

Had the Indian and Devils Ranch flavours and they were ok but not great. Ordered the wings to be picked up at a certain time and when we arrived we had to wait 15 mins. The wings were not crispy but maybe that's because they were sitting in the take out container for the ride home.  I prefer St. Luis wings over this place. The wings here are bigger but not as crispy as St. Luis and I was looking for spicy wings which this place did not deliver.  If you want spicy wings similar to St. Luis suicide then maybe get sauces much much hotter than Indian or Devils Ranch."}
{"text":"Service was awful. It's just a little place designed for take out. I ordered wings and mushroom caps. Took forever to make and about 25 minutes later they were ready. The order was up and they took forever to grab it even though they had two workers at the cash, one not taking any orders lol. I heard my name being called and they just assumed I wasn't there! I had to ask was that order under my name and then they were like oh yeah that's for you, like it was a hilarious joke. My mushroom caps were without the ranch dressing, thank you. The wings were good but it's going to take a lot more for me to come back here again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 lbs of wings.  One dry rub and one wet.   The wings were hit but both pounds were bland.  The BBQ dry rub was utterly tasteless.  The other pound honey/mustard was just a mess.  

I did feel sorry for my server.  The place was busy and she had to enquiry with each person what their order was.  Anyway, I will have to satisfy my wing craving elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's just like Wow Wing House because the menu is very similar."}
{"text":"Came to pick up some wings on a weekend night and there were drunk patrons reeking of booze and cigarette.  I know this is no fault of the business but it turned me off right off the bat.

Their sauce offering was just ho hum and even their spiciest sauce was just so so.  The wings were ok except for tasting a little like old oil and this coming from a place that just had grand opening not so long ago is definitely not a great sign.  Wings were not heavily breaded which was a plus for our group.  Fries was your usually take out soggy stuff.  

All in all, not sure if I would go out of my way to order from here again since I can easily whip up a batch of oven baked wings that are more crispy and less oily than what they offer here."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! I can't remember life before town wings, the flavour is truly something else. My go to place when I want to indulge in savoury goodness. Mexican wrap and Mexican fries are a real delight. Not a lot of people know about this spot, so I hope more people get to experience it. I have recommended it to all my friends and family and they have yet to be disappointed with what they've received. If I could give a higher rating than 5 I would."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, and the wings were just okay. The fries were just okay too.. the prices seemed expensive considering i was still starving after eating 1.5 pounds with some fries.. maybe it was because...the wings were small. Furthermore, the spices were like no name spices from nofrills and the sauce was sparse. I wont be going back because i was disappointed and in comparison to other wing joints, this place was not was i was hoping for, unfortunately."}
