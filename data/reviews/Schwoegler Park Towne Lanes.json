{"text":"Didn't bowl, but went for a drink in the Schwoegler's bar on a busy Friday night. The place has a generic look typical of any other sports bar. There are two rather imposing uniformed security guards seated at the entrances to the bar, which gives the impression that the place has had some problems. My main complaint is that the bar reeked of cigarette smoke. There's a \"smoking room\" adjacent to the bar, and every time the door is opened the smoke seeps into the room. It's overwhelming and is the main reason my friend and I left quickly after one drink. Another note... My wine glass wasn't clean. It had someone's lipstick residue on it. I've worked in a bar before and know that wine glasses need to be checked even when they've been run through the cleaning cycle. Lipstick and lip balm leave a waxy residue."}
{"text":"Had a party for my son's birthday and my wife's baby shower here.  Did some group bowling and rented a room for the party.  It was less than $250 for 10 kids bowling (I think for an hour) and two hours in the room, with unlimited soda (three flavors), three large pizzas, a huge veggie tray and a huge meat/cheese/cracker tray.  Staff was super helpful coordinating everything, helping out when we needed, and cleaned up the room for us."}
{"text":"I bring the kids I nanny here and they love it. The music is great and they love the disco balls and lights. We had no problem getting shoes for them and they participate in the free bowling for kids summer program."}
{"text":"Bought a $15 \"Koupon\" online for 5 people, shoes, and 2 games each.  Normally $50."}
{"text":"This was a really nice outing with the friends. Price of $10.5 for 2.5 hours of bowling seemed reasonable. Also, the pizza was unexpectedly nice and beer was good. I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my friends' and my go-to bowling alley.

They have the best deals I've seen. We went a lot on Sundays. It's $7 for all-you-can-bowl-in-2.5-hours. Mondays were $2 games and Tuesdays were $1 games. There were Groupon deals that frequently featured Schwoegler Park Towne Lanes as well. However, whenever they have bowling leagues or tournaments, there's a good chance you won't be able to get a lane. 

Oh and shoe rentals aren't included in the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday deals I mentioned above. We went so much that we ended up buying a pair of our own shoes. I highly recommend that if you plan on bowling anywhere more than 5 times. You can get a cheap pair for $20."}
{"text":"I feel like I was swindled when I went here. Be very aware, on a friday night it's $4 per person, per game. We paid $40 for 1.2 hours of bowling. INSANE! This is an ABSURD price for bowling. Not even the swanky bar/lounge/bowling alley in the heart of downtown Chicago by the Magnificent Mile charges as much for the same amount of time we went bowling. And this is the outskirts of Madison, Wisconsin. 

The price per game is not clearly marked at all, unless you go on the website. Unfortunately, we walked in off the street...odds are if you're reading this and on the internet in general, you won't make our mistake. I mean, caveat emptor...but I am pissed. The guy at the counter didn't even bat an eye at our incredulity, it seems like this happens ALL the time. 

As to the bowling alley itself, drinks are decently priced for Madison. The equipment is not particularly modern, but you're not bowling with rigs from the fifties. The selection of bowling balls is bad. The finger holes are all super tiny, and I have long, slim fingers, so it's not like I have particularly large fingers. The alley was also not super crowded, so there should have been more adult-sized balls available. The alley was fairly clean.

I'll never come back here. If you want to get ripped off on a date, come here. Otherwise, AVOID!"}
{"text":"With Karaoke and great beer prices - great for the bar area.

Bowling is expensive , although there are plenty of deals to go and it's always fun. I have no dislike of the place and it is close to where I live so I am partial."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bar - not the bowling alley.

Schwoegler's has always been a nice staple in the bars I've visited. It's usually decently crowded on a Friday or Saturday, the drinks were cheap enough, and they have a cool smoking area that's a wonderful reprieve for smokers in the winter.

Last few times I've gone it has been a different story though. The bar is about as dead as can be, the drinks are poured weaker, and you get to have two hourly wage rent-a-cops glaring at you wherever you go. I suppose it's a necessary thing as the area has started to have some trouble with drunks and violence, but having a security guard that looks like he's a candy bar away from having a full-blown heart attack doesn't make me feel any safer.

It's not the worst place to drink at. I mean, it is a bowling alley after all, so I'm not expecting high class. If you want to meet up with friends somewhere close by this isn't a terrible option."}
{"text":"A fun place for bowling and gathering with groups of friends!  They have excellent service, clean facilities, and great prices.  The food is standard greasy bar fare, and hits the spot if that's what you're craving.  The lanes are up to date as well."}
{"text":"I had not been bowling in Madison until I went to Schwoegler Park Towne Lanes. I had a bucky book for buy one game get one free. The equipment seemed like it was added in 1992. The selection of bowling balls for a facility that has 30+ lanes was pretty slim. Most bowling balls had tiny holes or fat holes. I have piano fingers and they just couldn't fit in the right ball. The food at the bar was good, I had a bucky book coupon for that too. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. I believe they called it the \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" It was good food for a bar. I would go back as long as they had decent prices. I'm sure the reason they haven't updated is because the lack of interest in bowling nowadays."}
{"text":"Stopped in at noon for a lunch using a Bucky Book coupon.  Wife and I ordered a burger basket.  Oh man!  Best greasy burger we've had in a long time.  Too bad we live on the east side."}
{"text":"Had our Employee Christmas Party there on 2-26-2017 and everyone loved it!  Good food, great service and great bowling!

Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once for a birthday party. Man did I love this place. It was way better than Ten Pin. I had an awesome deal for a vodka/Monster pitcher. The lanes were pretty good and I liked the environment. The food wasn't bad either. The shoes were clean. The public balls weren't bad. The one bartender I worked with was nice. The only downside is that my friend called in to ask if she could drink the night before her birthday for her party and they told her yes, but when we got there they said no. I would love to come back here, but tend to only bowl during the winter so I probably won't back for awhile. I look forward to the drunken nights here where I get to converse and pretend like I know how to bowl~"}
{"text":"Took advantage of Ladies Night on Thursday (a weekly event, after 9pm). Ladies bowl for free (shoes included). I haven't been to this location in over a year and the last time I went I remember it was a pleasant experience. This time was different. 

Employees were all super helpful and kind. The place was clean. The food was typical. The downfall is the quality of their shoes and bowling balls. 

My big toe was nearly popping out of the shoes I was given, making them uncomfortable to wear. A majority of the bowling balls I found had abnormal hole sizes (either way tiny or huge and spread apart). I saw dented finger holes (how does that even happen) and rubber insoles squished to the bottom. 

When I finally found a bowling ball that I could use, it had a chip on the inside of the thumb hole and it cut my thumbs open when I bowled. Ended up doing some granny bowling for most of my time there. 

Most of the action seemed to be happening in the bar area. It seems they have decent weekly specials on bowling and food/drinks and they have lots of coupons online to use."}
{"text":"Very Cheep Management! Really will charge you for the littlest thing's. Eg. Ask for a tiny cup of sauce. Look carefully at how cheap management is. Sadly customer is not a concern."}
{"text":"Great bowling place, helpful manager made our time with our kids fun. Will be back. Also good beer specials and pinball selection."}
{"text":"For bowling I'd probably do 2.5 stars... But the 4 stars is for the fact that Madison Pinball has placed a load of well maintained Pinball machines here!  

I'll refrain from being a grumpy old man and mentioning that pinball used to be 5 balls for a quarter back when I was a kid..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Schwoegler Bowling Alley.  On Thursdays, they have \"Ladies Night\" where women bowl free from 9pm to Midnight. They also do a glow n the dark theme starting at 10pm. I am not sure if this is something they do daily or only on Thursdays but either way, nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Not only is it a fine bowling alley BUT the pinball machines are all free! You can play classic pinball machines, including but not limited to Lethal Weapon 3, KISS, and Baywatch."}
{"text":"I have a 3 1/2 year old who learned about bowling from the wii and wanted to check out real bowling so we decided to go. This alley is the closest and a friend if mine told me that they have ramps that little kids can use to bowl. So we headed out in the snow to have some indoor fun. We got there and the guy behind the counter barely acknowledged us at first. Then when we were getting shoes he was irritated because we didn't have bowling shoes for our daughter. I guess it was our bad for not calling beforehand to see if they have kids sizes and they don't. But oh we'll she used her socks that were non slip. The bowling alley itself is in good condition and the ramp for kids is sweet although you have to pay 2 bucks to rent it. It does seem that this place does have charges for every little thing. Definitely not an every week outing. But I digress, we had a great time bowling but I do agree with the other posters in here who mentioned the poor supply of bowling balls. Many with tiny holes and many with huge holes. But all in all we had a good time. And the food is good too."}
{"text":"This is a quick and easy place for me to grab lunch.  Just down the road from work, they're never too busy and the food is pretty good.  The big draw has always been the $1 burgers, tacos and fries.  Pretty easy to cobble together a nice lunch for a few dollars.  But today, we found out that those prices were changed (but not until after we ordered and ate).  Burgers were upgraded to \"deluxe burgers\", which are a little more meat and include lettuce, tomato and onion.  Tacos went to $1.50/each or two for $2.50.  That would have been nice to know before ordering.  Lesson learned.

But, with that being said, the food is still pretty good.  The tacos are quite delicious and the burgers are much better than the fast food versions nearby.  It's a great meal, and you're served pretty fast, so lunches don't drag out (sometimes you don't mind, but if you're in a hurry, you can still come here).  

The folks working the bar are very nice and easy to talk to.  They're quick to top off your soda refills.  We're always greeted with a big smile, and we always get a hearty \"'g'bye, see you next time\" when we leave.  Very friendly staff.

Overall, very good food and a nice lunch spot.  I'm a little put off by the price changes - that will be factored into future lunch discussions as we decide where to go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this 'our home away from home.' If you appreciate Schweg's for what it is, you will have a good time! Nice bartenders, cheap drinks, good bar food. We love a game of darts and shake of the day (although I have never won) on a night when we are looking for something to do.

Their food is good - nachos are delicious. 

My favorite thing about Schweg's though is their B1G1 chips for every extra point during a Packer or Badger game. What a deal! If you are only getting one drink, you can trade the chips in for a chip back with the value of that drink. Talk about a deal!! Their food specials during game days are awesome, too! $2 burgers can't be beat. 

Friday & Saturday nights have karaoke, too! :)"}
{"text":"I visit Schwoegler's regularly to play pinball. I do bowl but not often enough I guess. I primarily come here for the great service, friendly employees and pinball. Oh and the good selection of beer. Great happy hour prices and food specials. I feel very welcome here and I will keep coming back. I've had some of the food and the pretzel chili dog is absolutely delicious. I love how all the toppings are off to the side and you can dress it yourself. Pinball tournament every third Saturday of every month at 6pm. Everyone is invited to play."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty fun. We're east siders and just left Chuckie cheese and decided to go bowling. The only down part is the people next to us. They had at least 10 ppl just hanging out around the chairs and alley way.  Numerous times blocking my view of my family bowling and walking thru and around our designated bowling area, one of their many children spilled a drink on the floor in front of our area and walked away,  super obnoxious .  Quite frustrating to say the least. I wish management would have a sign or something saying how many ppl can be on the floor at once bowling. I'll attach a picture to show you how they were standing our whole time bowling."}
{"text":"It's more of a family-focused place rather than a serious bowling alley.  They recently updated their scoring system which made it a lot better, but the constant glow bowling and crowd of rowdy kids make it hard to bowl if you're actually trying to improve."}
{"text":"I love this place.

It's close enough to my place that I can still go out, without going all the way downtown. For those nights when I'd just rather keep it real with my friends, at the Schwoegler's sports bar (which has ample HDTVs) or out on the lanes.

The bar offers good specials and great service, and the lanes are well maintained and utilize quality scoring systems. Oh, and their league nights are very well managed too.

Really, this is a bowling alley... I'm not sure how to write the glowing review that it deserves, but it is a great establishment regardless of my writer's block."}
{"text":"I use to come here when I was younger but haven't been on a while but a couple months ago we meet up with friends. We grabbed a seat in the bar while we waited and it was super dirty and smelly. The bartender coughed and sneezed into his hands several times, not washing them once. 

When we got our lanes and bowling shoes the gentleman at the front was super rude. The bowling area was slightly cleaner then the bar. We wanted pitchers of beer but no one was working the bar located in the bowling area so we had to go into the actual bar and order there which took forever. I'm sure this place was the same when I was a teenager but it definitely looked pretty rough inside and had probably seen better days. It was also expensive, I don't really have prices to compare it too because I haven't been bowling in forever. But for a few games it was over $20 which I guess seems expensive to me but I could be wrong. Probably won't be back, if we ever decide to go bowling again we will probably try a different place."}
