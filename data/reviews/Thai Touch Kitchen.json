{"text":"4.5 stars...we were looking for good Thai in the South Hills... tried sawasdee and it left us looking for something that can compare to Nicky's and  I have to say - I was not disappointed with this place.  A bit small, but very clean with extremely friendly staff, fast service, and kitchen is visible from the tables.  Food was fresh; we tried the dumplings appetizer and I got pineapple fried rice with 6-heat. My wife had the shrimp pad Thai with 8- heat.  While delicious, the heat levels were a bit mild so don't be afraid to go 10 if you want it spicy!  We'll def go back - best Thai I've had so far in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"Don't blink or you'll miss this brand new Thai offering on Rt 19, Mt Lebanon!  Just a few doors up from Potomac Bakery on the same side.
Very intimate with seating for about 20.

 HEAT- start light and gauge your heat for your return visit.  I did 5.  My palate isn't as heat tolerant as it used to be, but I could have done a 7...if that helps!

-Great Kitchen-Style facility.
-Take Out-Eat In.  
-Owner Chef; \"Ae\"
-Open kitchen.
-Excellent service-
-High Touch authentic Thai-
-Reasonably priced-
-Quick and casual!
-Say hello to \"Tues\"! (server)."}
{"text":"Located where the also-excellent Couscous Caf√© used to be, Thai Touch is a terrific surprise and great addition to Uptown Mt. Lebanon. Quaint, clean, with an open kitchen and friendly staff, this place has become a new lunch favorite. 

Got the steamed dumplings and green curry with noodles on first visit. The curry was light and piping hot - we're talking *molten* hot, right out of the pot - so heads up. Was stuffed up with a cold, and so I ordered the curry with a spiciness of 7 on a 1-10 scale. Cleared my sinuses and then some! Second visit I got the basil chicken. Both dishes were light, spicy, and tasted fresh. Eager to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm always curious to try new Thai restaurants, so I stopped in here recently for lunch.  The space is on the smaller side, but it doesn't feel cramped at all, it's clean, and the decor is lovely.  Everyone working there was friendly and very pleasant - I got the impression that they genuinely enjoyed what they were doing, which translated into the restaurant having a very welcoming feel to it.

I was feeling somewhat indecisive while I was there so I ordered two things - the green tea leaves salad (on special) and a mango curry.  I usually don't drink much green tea because it gets a bitter taste if it's steeped too long, but eating this reminded me of how nice the flavor of it is.  Actually, this is probably my new favorite way of having anything with green tea or green tea flavoring in it, ever.  I would have never thought of putting tea leaves on a salad to eat, but it's absolutely delicious.  The salad is a fairly sizeable portion - it contains greens, the green tea leaves, mixed nuts, tomatoes, carrots and lemon juice on top.  The greens were more iceburg lettuce than darker ones, but the addition of the tea leaves made it feel balanced.  I don't even really like nuts or tomatoes much, but they provided just the right amount of crunch and softness to the salad, respectively.  Since everything has lemon juice on it the salad itself doesn't appear quite firm - visually it's not the most exciting, but it tastes so wonderful.

The mango curry had slices of mango, green and red peppers, red curry powder, coconut milk and your choice of protein. I was expecting there to be a stronger mango flavor while biting into the slices of it.  The curry itself wasn't bad, but it didn't have much of a particular flavor overall to it, and it was a bit more liquid-y than curries I've had elsewhere.  I'm not sure if the thickness of them varies more in Thailand, but personally I prefer them to not be so thin.  As far as the spice level goes, I ordered a 4 - I can handle some spice but not an exorbitant amount, and this worked just fine for me.  Again, this was a decent curry, everything was well cooked and fresh, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had the liquid been thicker, with a bit more flavor. Since I enjoyed the other part of my order so much though, I would definitely come here again and try things other than their curries.

The price was slightly more than where I usually get Thai food from (in Bloomfield), but considering that the cost of living is a lot higher in Mt. Lebanon the price seems perfectly fine for the area.  The portion sizes were decent (I had plenty for leftovers!), so I was still pleased with the amount of food I received for the price."}
{"text":"Small diner like place. Awesome Panang Curry!! They can bring the heat baby!!! Love love!! Kicking this cold right out of my head!!! Just as an (FYI) I love Nicky's Thai. I will however come here more often for the Panang Curry!! Moving forward for them glass plates and lower lighting would be a plus!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ran into this gem tonight for a date night dinner.  Love the flavors.  Really good Thai food.  We had the pad se-ew and penang curry. Both were delish! In terms of spicyness, we usually get 7 or 8 and we tried 8. It was hot so we might do 7 in the future. Anyways. Tasty food. Very friendly service"}
{"text":"Must eat here!   Service and food are both wonderful!  Pad see ew is my fave!!!  Had the steamed dumplings the other nite and my mouth waters just thinking about them.   It's a small place & byob."}
{"text":"Called for pick-up while at Hitchhiker Brewery around 7 pm on a Saturday. We were told a 20 minute wait so not bad...especially when at a brewery.

It is a small restaurant, but since we didn't eat in I can't comment on that. However, I did have to pay immediately and it is expensive. $51 for 4 dinners.

Now the food: it was hotter than imagined! And I only requested a spice level of 5. It was so hot that it wasn't enjoyable. I just finished the leftovers and my stomach is burning. I would try the curry again, but definitely say NO SPICE!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Thai Touch multiple times now.  They are the sole Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh serving Kao Soy, one of my favorite dishes.  Food items have been well prepared and in ample quantity.  Spicing is well suited to the various dishes and can be tempered based on a diner's preference.  The Thom Kha soup is fresh, has a nice amount of lemongrass and coconut milk, and is the perfect dish for the cold weather in Pittsburgh.  Happy to have this new restaurant in our community."}
{"text":"I'm not one to consume extremely spicy foods, so when I arrived at the Thai Touch Kitchen, I was pleased to discover there is a spicy scale! Being new to Thai food, I decided to go with a spicy level of two. The extremely nice waiter smiled and nodded as if he knew my tolerance for spicy food was limited. 

Located in Uptown Mt. Lebanon, Thai Touch is a wonderful restaurant that I will continue to enjoy. The small, charming restaurant seats about 20 to 25. It has an open kitchen and a fun, welcoming atmosphere. The service is great and really makes the experience all the more pleasant. 

I ordered the dumplings for a starter, which were flavorful and the perfect start to the meal. I also ordered the shrimp pad thai with a spicy level of two and thoroughly enjoyed it! There was a lot on the plate, and the flavors were present in each bite. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and blended in with the flavors. I would definitely order the pad thai again. 

I plan on bringing friends and the boyfriend here for dinner! I also discovered that Thai Touch has takeout, so my summer nights just got a whole lot better."}
{"text":"The personnel were very friendly, and the environment is cozy but comfortable.  The food was extremely good, and was authentic as you could get for the area.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My experience here was not good. It took a while to get a glass of water and then our food orders. The portions are rather small for being so expensive. I got the eggplant salad and green curry. Neither one were anything special and the waiter overcharged me. He would not let me speak to a manager and would not change the receipt. I didn't leave a tip and won't be returning. The customer service was terrible and they should be embarrassed as a restaurant for treating customers that way."}
{"text":"My first take out order, and it arrived promptly. Some napkins and chopsticks would have been nice, but I did get a straw for the Thai Coffee. Including the coffee ordered the steamed dumplings, green curry (level 8) with shrimp and the steamed coconut rice custard in a pumpkin shell. The coffee could have used some more coffee, the steamed dumplings were delicious (5 in the order, I ate two before the pic). The green curry was spicy with a great mix of veg, a little runny, and 6 delicious shrimp. The rice custard was kind of slimy and visually unappetizing. All in all, a decent meal and  probably not worth $31 before tax and tip."}
{"text":"Why are there not as many ethnic restaurants in the South Hills as other areas? I ask myself this every time I put Thai food in my mouth. Nom nom. The South Hills does not have many Thai options. I tried this restaurant on a whim because after a long work week on Friday night the last thing I want is for driving a far distance to cut into my wine drinking time. I purchased take out as I prefer to eat in the comfort of my own home where I can eat Thai food where I can enjoy a box of blackbox wine (for myself). I ordered the Pad See Ew tofu with extra vegetables and spring rolls. The spring rolls were fantastic however the Pad See Ew noodles were dry and it didn't appear to have much of the dark garlic soy sauce that I longed for. Perhaps it was subpar due to the fact that it was ordered an hour near closing (I don't feel like that's an excuse, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt)."}
{"text":"Third time around was a charm. Despite the slightly long wait on Mother's Day, the front of the house managed to keep me informed about my pick-up time while the chef delivered three entrees. The Pad Thai is at par with all the others Thai places within 10 miles - sweet, lacking in punch and any lively flavors. The green curry - at 3 heat - was flavored well. Not too salty, not too spicy, though a tad runny. A decent dollop of varied veggies made it a nice portion for 2. The Tofu Eggplant with basil was a nice, smoky surprise. It's usually salty and the eggplant over cooked. This one was well seasoned with copious bamboo shoots and bell peppers to round out the dish. This experience was a big improvement over my first two attempts as it relates to the food, and front of the house."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better Thai place in Pittsburgh! Limited seating but the food is so so good. I typically like to go out to the city when I go out to eat but I got lucky this place is close to home in mt Lebanon. Staff is always attentive and food comes out quick and hot!! Caution with your spice level, it's fairly potent. Also, they just opened up a sister restaurant in squirrel hill on Forbes Ave! Same menu, different name (Thai & Noodle Outlet)"}
{"text":"Great little place for when you need a Thai food craving filled! My go to is Pad See Ew and I think they have a great version. Be warned, their spicy scale is 1-10 and I like spicy food, but even a 4 can be sinus clearing! The green papaya salad is pretty good and my dining partner enjoyed the steamed dumplings. The Thai Iced Coffee is strong and delicious! I'd skip the fresh spring rolls though, they just didn't do it for me with bell pepper in them and just a lot of iceberg lettuce. 

The dining area is small, but you don't feel like you are on top other diners. 

Metered street parking and a nearby parking garage is steps away."}
{"text":"Recently had my first experience at Thai Touch Kitchen and it was great! It's a small restaurant, so 2 friends and I made a reservation for 7 pm on a Saturday. Our table was ready and waiting. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant was filled. We shared crab wontons, pad Thai and fried rice and we really enjoyed it all. I have since ordered take out, and was equally happy the second time! I will definitely add it to the rotation.. Oh and it's BYOB which we love! A nice dinner out and very affordable. Try it!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place- quaint restaurant with amazing food and service.  It's nice to sit at the little table outside if you ever get the chance!"}
{"text":"Ample selections
We tried the tofu paradise appetizer
It was plenty for two
The food seems very authentic 
Will definitely come back to try more on the menu"}
{"text":"Drove right pass this place on the way there. You'll miss it if you blink. Everything was great from the crab rangoon, pad thai, thai tea, and service. Prices are fair, especially for being in Mt Lebanon"}
{"text":"Very good food.  I have to admit I keep ordering the same meal(spicy tilapia), but it never fails to impress."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night.  We loved it!  We had made a reservation but then had to cancel because our babysitter got stuck in traffic.  When we got there about 30 minutes late, they were still holding the table for us.  It's byob and we brought a bottle of white wine.  They opened it right away and put it on ice for us.  We ordered two appetizers and two entrees.  I had the green curry and it was excellent.  I ordered a 4 on the spicy scale and it was HOT but still great so maybe go conservative on the spice level.  My husband had the pad see ew and it was great also.  It's a tiny restaurant so I'd recommend making a reservation if going on a weekend evening. 

We loved it and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thai Touch Kitchen is one of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. They're food is always consistent. Service is good if you dine in. And also a good place to order take out and eat at home. 
For appetizers I would definitely order the crispy spring rolls and samosa. For the entree my favorite is the pad cashew noodles. A lot of Thai restaurants had mostly the same dishes but this noodle dish I have not seen at any other Thai restaurants. I get it with only vegetables, no meat and they load it up with lots of veggies. 
No complaints for Thai Touch Kitchen."}
{"text":"Went back again and it was just add good as the first time. We were lucky that there was a table available since it started getting busy toward the end of our meal. I got a cashew noodle dish which was wonderful. Fiance got his pineapple fried rice which he loved as well. This place is definitely in our evening rotation."}
{"text":"I love this small but big and bold flavor.  I'm in love with Banana Blossom soup and Chili fried rice.  I would recommended this small but packed with some heat flavor!"}
{"text":"Small place but the server was ve
ry nice. Tom Yum soup with vegetables had a lot of fresh veggies but the broth had too much salt.  The green curry with chicken was delicious! Full of flavor and veggies."}
{"text":"This place is the best Thai I've had in the south hills. There's a lot of really good Thai restaurants in pittsburgh and I think this place is almost as close as some of my favorite ones. 

I stopped in to pick up take out. I didn't realize how small this place was but it provides some much needed diversity in the little strip of restaurants on Washington road in Mt. Lebanon. 

 I ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken. The soup was really good. I ordered a spice level 8 on a 10 scale. It was spicy but still so good. The spring rolls are really good and the sauce it comes with was perfect. The green curry with chicken had a great flavor. I only wish they cooked the green beans a little more. My husband had the red curry noodles. So good! I should of got his. Next time I think I'll get the red curry. The flavor was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, and my go-to suggestion when friends want to go out to eat. They have a large variety of authentic dishes, and it's fun to be able to try something that's different from anything I've ever had before every time I eat here. My favorites are any of their dishes with eggplant, as well as their salads. Drink-wise, I recommend the Thai iced tea, especially if you've never had one before. The portion sizes are fairly large too, and it's encouraged to share dishes with each other much like you do at a Chinese restaurant. Also, they'll ask you how spicy you'd like your food on a scale of 1-10;  I love spicy food and consider myself to have a slightly above average tolerance to spice, and I find 7 is my sweet spot for something that's hot but doesn't overpower the dish for me."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Their heat index is on point and they do not eff around. I asked for a 7 and no \"white spice\" and they delivered. She warned me it would be hot and I assured her I could handle it and I was pleased. The kee mao was so delicious. Noodles were wide and cooked perfectly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"this place not bad 
food taste good 
only thing it's very small 
and lady who take a order not attention at all.
we order appetizer , soup and main dish.
She brings soup first , Main dish, second 
and appetizer last.
they have spacial Monday- Friday 
11-3pm order main dish they give you free cup of soup.
But they forgot bring soup (((


Prices little bit to high 
we spend $36 
I think it's little expensive for place like this."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Thai food on a Sunday afternoon and Thai Touch Kitchen was one of the only Thai restaurants open in my area. 

My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for lunch. On weekends all of their entrees are only available in the dinner size so my boyfriend and I decided to order two appetizers and share an entree.

For appetizers, we ordered the clear spring rolls which resembled Vietnamese Spring Rolls without meat and was accompanied with a small side of peanut dipping sauce. The spring rolls were surprisingly bland and tasted a lot like a romaine salad wrapped in rice paper. We saw a yummy looking picture on Yelp of the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and ordered that as our second appetizer. I could not eat the soup.. it tasted entirely too fishy for mine and my boyfriend's tastes. Big disappointment because it looked so appetizing.

For our appetizers we shared the green curry at a spice level of 7. I liked the concept of having a spice level but I quickly found out that only determined how many red pepper flakes they sprinkled over your dish. The green curry was very watery and no where near as thick as the curries that I am used to. 

Definitely not the best Thai food I've eve had."}
{"text":"Pretty great little blink-and-you'll-miss-it hole in the wall. It's a little small, comparatively, seating around 25 people at the most. 

We ordered the spring roll as an appetizer, two orders, which ended up being more than we could eat. Each one is a rather large stuffed lettuce, cucumber and carrot roll cut into four large pieces each the size of a huge piece of sushi. 

Pad Kee Mao, Thai Style Fried Rice, Pad Peanut Sauce. 

For those of you who love Drunken Noodles, it's the Pad Kee (kie) Mao, which was absolutely delicious. Made of wide rice noodles, Savory without being too salty or oddly sweet, yet crunchy. I loved it, and would recommend it again! 

One of the cons was this odd smell that came from near the back. Also, we had to call for the waitress after a while. Not too bad, though!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has decent Thai food, and the prices are reasonable. However, we've had some bad service experiences and won't be returning. We came in at 8 on a Sunday night--a little late, sure, but well before the 9 pm closing time. Our waitress messed up our order, and then tried to blame us for it (everyone makes mistakes! it would be nice for the mistaken individual to apologize, though). She spent the evening on her cellphone, which is pretty unprofessional and made us feel weird as we had to call her over a couple of times. The servers started to put up chairs 15 minutes to closing time. Guess they wanted to get home! It kind of made us feel like we couldn't finish our meal, so we just requested some to-go boxes and called it a day. 

I think this place could be really good, but it would be nice if they had more polite staff."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to say this place has gone down hill. All the staff that made the place special quit. I hope they make corrections because what was a great Thai place is now mediocre."}
{"text":"Came in tonight to grab a bite with a hungry 4 year old.  I was getting my order to go and after repeating my order 3 times (5 items) I was told that it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Being a nice day and not wanting to bother anyone with the 4 year old we told them that we'd be back. After my 22 minute walk I come back to them telling me that they forgot to put my order in. After their apologies and promise that they would make right now and that it would only take 10 minutes we left again. After our 10 min walk, they then asked again what I ordered.....THEY FORGOT TO MAKE IT AGAIN! I WALKED OUT"}
{"text":"Great little Thai Spot in a cool neighborhood. Small, but authentic. BYOB, great service and delicious Pad Thai. Also, the dumplings are AMAZING."}
{"text":"After recently having my first Thai experience at Nicky's in the Northside, my expectations were extremely high! I was pleasantly surprised to learn of new Thai Touch in Mt. Lebo, minutes from my house. Ordered takeout crab rangoon, pad Thai, and spicy chicken fried rice. The food was ready on time and I was greeted by friendly employees in clean restaurant. The food was not quite as amazing as Nicky's and the prices were a bit higher, but would order again for the convenience."}
{"text":"I am on the fence with this one. I like yellow curry generally but you never know if you'll like a place's curry until you try it. I think I liked it but I let them put too much spice in it.  I should have gone with a 3 or maybe no spice at all. I went with 6 and that heat kept me from tasting the curry. I also got tofu and their tofu is the chewy type. I prefer a more creamy tofu. The dessert we tried was nicely sweet with pieces of pumpkin in it.

It's a bit of a dive inside but they've added a few items to jazz it up - like mismatched ceiling light fixtures.

They get a lot of take out business. Its a narrow space and sometimes the customers picking up were standing right at our table.

Parking is convenient - right next to them is a parking garage."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Thai place!! Hands down some of the best chicken satay I've ever had. The peanut sauce is amazing and I find myself taking a spoon to what's left after the chicken has been eaten. Love their pad Thai and their pad see ew. My husband and I always end up ordering our own Pad See Ew because we hate sharing it!! The noodles are the super wide delicious rice noodles and the sauce is so tasty. I will say, these guys don't hold back on spice. We usually order mild because it still has quite a kick to it. Spice lovers should try ordering a 3 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Service is lovely and the food is fantastic. Like every other Thai restaurant in the area, I feel like the food could be a lot more spicy. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was good.  But a $3 \"corkage\" fee when we brought our own six pack is nuts!  The server didn't even bring us glasses for the beer.  What is the purpose of charging that much for nothing?  If you want to make money from alcohol, get a liquor license.  It will be take out from here from now on, if anything."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever!!!!! Best Thai food and excellent service. The Thom Ka soup is incredible. Whenever I want Thai food i always go here :)"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to shine, but I was disappointed. It's a small place, not cramped though. The fire department sign on the wall says the max occupancy is 22! They do have a few tables outside on the sidewalk. 
Crab rangoons were ok, the wrapper was a little too thick.  
Green curry ($13.00)
had the right amount of spice. I ordered a 7 and it was good and hot!  The curry itself was watery, there were large chunks of eggplant and some weren't cooked through. (No one likes raw eggplant). The pounded flat chicken was very dry and bland. There were a few pieces of broccoli and some green beans. 
The pad Thai was just boring, it needed some fresh green onions or something to liven it up.
I so wanted this place to be good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate it an 11.
I will start off by saying their customer service is the BEST. They are always all soo friendly and accommodating. I am allergic to many things and often have to remove items from my order or ask for special instructions, and I have always been soo impressed with everything here and their welcoming happy faces. 
Everytime I order something new, its my new favorite and just wows me more than the last dish. 
If you don't like thai food, It doesn't matter. Go here anyways. You will love it. I have had thai food before, but not like this! It is the BEST.
I have never been to a restaurant where I just wanted to compliment EVERYTHING but everything here is just amazing. The veggies are ALWAYS soo fresh. And the tofu is always cooked perfect. 
The first time I went here, I ordered pad thai and did not know our orders came with soup. I tried the soup, and never forgot it lol. Whenever I order, I get an order of Vegetable tofu soup because it is literally the best thing I have ever had. 
I am a vegetarian, but have tried many things here. I will HIGHLY recommend the Mango salad with Tofu, pad thai, fresh roll... and of course, the VEGETABLE TOFU SOUP!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever tasted. Every time I try another Thai restaurant I am disappointed. If they ever closed it would be so traumatic I would probably require a therapist to get me through it. My absolute favorite dish is the Pumpkin Curry."}
{"text":"I've never been to Thailand but Thai Touch's food certainly seems authentic. I've eaten here a number of times and their food is always very good. 

I'm fond of the Pad Kee Mao and their Thai iced tee. But be warned: their food is on the spicy side. They use a 1-10 scale and I've found a 5 to be as spicy as a 10 at other restaurants. I've also sampled my friends 9 and found it to be about as hot as my 5. That's the only complaint I can make about their food. 

Crazy would be a kind way of describing the atmosphere. It's just tiny and seats about 10 people at the most. In fact, 10 people would make that place feel uncomfortable. So don't plan on taking a large party. 

Overall, it's a solid experience and their food is very good."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is one of the best Thai restaurant in this area. I like their Drunken Noodles and Tom Yam soup - try the one with coconut milk if you like creamy soup!"}
{"text":"What a find!! This came recommended to me from a friend who requires a gluten free diet... but this was just excellent all the way around!! It has been difficult to find a truly tasty Thai restaurant nearby, so I was super excited to go be this place a try.

It's SUPER small inside - literally only has 3 tables, so I would DEFINITELY call ahead before planning to eat-in here. But for take out, you can't beat it! I did eat in for a week day lunch with a party of 4 and was able to be immediately seated. One person has a pork allergy and they were very accommodating to his needs. We all loved our food. Everything i tried was very flavorful and tasted like it was made with all fresh ingredients! I can be kind of a Thai-food snob, and I was thoroughly impressed with their food! My favorite dish I tried there was the curry. I will be returning soon for take out for sure!"}
