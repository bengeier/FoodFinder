{"text":"I've been to about 10 dosa places in GTA and this is definitely the best that I've been to in Toronto.  The variety of dosa and other options are endless which is also one of the big appeals of this place.  One of the best vegetarian and southing Indian options in the GTA probably."}
{"text":"This our favourite South Indian restaurant... Anywhere....including many that we've been to in India!  We moved away from Toronto out west and every time we come back, this year is one of our must do destinations. The food is consistently delicious and comes out quickly. It's nice that there is a variety of spice levels to choose from and that one can customize the dosa's, never mind the sheer variety to start with. Although a tad on the higher price side (compared to other South Indian restaurants), the food quality justifies the difference."}
{"text":"This is a really LATE review. I have probably been here at least 15 times within the past few years and I have seen this business grow! The first time when I came here, it was half the size it is now and we did not have to make any reservations or have to wait at all. I enjoyed eating the dosas so much that I started coming in more frequently and the server remembered my order exactly! I like how they do have more space now. However, you should make reservations ahead of time otherwise you are going to be waiting for hours. I always make reservations at least a week in advance and I still have to wait around 20-30 minutes. I don't mind waiting since it is worth it and once you are seated, you do get your dosas pretty fast. I also get the uttapams sometimes which are like a soft fluffier version of a pizza.  The prices are reasonable, we usually spend around $20-30 for 2 people. I always receive really good service and the dosas come cooked as I like them. This is definitely the best dosa spot!"}
{"text":"The food is good but service is terrible! Even if you reserve a table, they make you wait for so long. The whole point of reserving a table is not waiting. I would refer this restaurant but due to the service and the unorganizable; I wouldn't."}
{"text":"Our experience was bad. We went on Sat evening around 7 and got reservation at 9.45 and after waiting for 2.5 hours they said it will be 15-20 mins more..we were very hungry and there was a 4 year old kid with us..and the guys who were outside were very rude and unprofessional..their attitude was also very bad.. They think they are running the best restaurant in the world..once inside they were rushing like hell like we have to get out in 15 mins somehow.. Though the dosas were good the entire experience was very bad.. Go only in weekdays if possible"}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat Dosa in GTA...They offer you a huge variety to choose from..no matter what u choose u can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"The place is closed till end of June 2014. We went all this way and found it closed. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"This place got downgraded to an average rating because of its customer service, rather the lack thereof. The 3 stars are solely because the food is still one of the most delicious I have had. So, despite my bad experience, the food salvages the place a little. My family and I have been to the restaurant and have done takeout multiple times in the past. The last 2 sit-down experiences have been less than desirable. Both times it involved a lengthy turnaround for one of our dishes. Last month, it was a rava dosa that apparently took the whole dinner time to prepare. We were told it would take some time, but we were not expecting an hour of wait. We had some appetizers and lassis. The rest of us 5 got our main dosas, almost finished them and my grandma's rava dosa hadn't arrived! We ended up cancelling it and sharing the rest of our food with her to eat. Servers were not even fazed, just \"we told you it will take time\" as if waiting over an hour for a dish is not unreasonable. Last Saturday topped it off though. We went for my SIL's B-Day. Again, we ordered the rava dosa for my grandma. Expecting the one hour wait, we ordered it first along with drinks and appetizers. For mains, we ordered 2 uttapams. We were told it will take 20-25 min, a longer turnaround than the other dishes. The rava dosa came so quickly this time we were all astonished. The utthapams took the longest. By the 40-min mark after ordering the mains, everyone else had all finished their food. So we asked the server how much longer it would take since it was past the 25 min they had told us. There started a horrible experience. We asked them to cancel the orders because we had waited for long enough and we were all ready to pay and leave. Instead of being apologetic and cancelling the order, they made us wait another 15-20 min, saying the utthapams are coming. They ignored our repeated requests to cancel. Then one utthapam arrives (this is at 50-min mark ish). Since I am pregnant and was still hungry, I accepted it. My father in law flat out told the server that he doesn't want the other utthapam even though she insisted it's coming. Again we were ignored. I had a quarter of it left and the 2nd dish arrived (past the one-hour mark). We refused it, saying we had cancelled it numerous times. They came back with the same dish 3 different times through 3 different servers over another 10-15 min, refusing still to cancel it. It got super ridiculous. Not once did they apologize, or even listen to our cancellation requests. One server even said at the end \"fine, I'll just pay for it on my own bill then\" and walked away. Great customer service right there, right? Not once did a manager or supervisor come by despite the situation getting more frustrating and escalated by the parade of servers that came to the table with that same plate, refusing to cancel our order when the dish hadn't even been made yet. It was beyond ridiculous. I may continue with takeout, maybe. But another sit-down experience like this makes me cringe. If they tell you something will take longer than normal, just don't order it. Get something else."}
{"text":"This is so far the best place for dosa .... we drove an hour to get to this place .. and it was extremely worth it .  Loved all the dishes it was so fresh ... which was way way better than the other south indian dishes I had in for example sarvana bhawan those guys suck ....  Keep up the good work guys..."}
{"text":"Fantastic dosas with great service! The pau bhaji dosa is amazing - definitely one of the best ones."}
{"text":"Reserved an hour or two ahead of time. Table was ready when we got there, service was fast so no complaints on that end. A mistake or two but it was understandable as the place was pretty busy. They also fixed their mistakes pretty fast.  The quality of food was good as well, wasn't amazing but defenitely worth it. If you wanted to try Dosa for the first time, I'd wager this is as good a place as any. It also has enough variety to keep the more seasoned veterans returning."}
{"text":"Lot of varieties for Dosa lovers. But I feel it is over rated. I did not like sambar here. And getting reservation is hard if u make last minute plans. You should also try komla Vilas."}
{"text":"Wow, should have know what we were in for by the line out the door!!!  I've had dosas before, but not like this.  The selection was fantastic, and you can customize your order to make even the most discerning foodie happy. Our server Manbir was greatly attentive and had some great suggestions when prompted. Try the Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masal Dosa. Food came quickly and was nice and warm. Will HIGHLY recommend - and of course will be back."}
{"text":"Simply overrated!! Same dosa...but splattered with different types of sauces from inside to expand the menu items.  This place gets busy...prices are low and so it get busy especially on weekends.   People could expect to wait up-to 60 minutes for their turn.....to eat this non-expensive meal.  They give you no time to take your time while eating....sit-order-eat-pay-and leave.  Crazy! Not worth it for me."}
{"text":"Freshly made dosa, coconut chutneys and delicious sambhar. There is a reason this place needs dinner reservations in a weekday. As one who knows this to be a staple food of the South (India), I was pleasantly surprised by the moderate cost to food quality ratio. A dosa usually clicks in around ~$15 +- $3, which is very reasonable for the service and freshness delivered. The manager/owner was present when my family and I went (3 people) and he seated us and was training a newbie at the same time. I overheard him say \"always look around at the customers, if they are making eye contact with you, they want something. So go help them\". When a place takes the initiative to teach it's staff good customer service, it shows. Combined with the great food, this place has become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Mind blowing! Best dosas in Toronto! Thank you Guru Lakshmi for reminding me of home in such a delicious way."}
{"text":"Long lineups and wait times if you don't book reservations   Funny thing is this place is not even run by South Indians. They are Punjabi.   Food is consistently good. No other place is as busy or good for Dosa"}
{"text":"Had Dosa for the first time yesterday and I absolutely loved it! The service was kind and attentive - especially when they overheard me asking a zillion questions!  He chimed in with a few suggestions here and there.   I ended up going with the mushroom dosa - three chillies and it was mind blowing delicious. the entire dish is eaten with your hands and although very spicy, it was overwhelmingly delicious. I can't wait to come back and try the other different dosas!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best places to have dosa and idli with the perfect ambience. Ordered the mini idlis for appetizers and they are the perfectly made idli: spongy but not chewy. I ordered rava dosa and it was super thin and crisp without being difficult to eat, not to mention large. Jeera lassi and mango lassi were also delicious!!! Two people can share one entree and an appetizer. also if your not much of a spicy person 1 chili level is perfect as anything beyond may be spicier than anticipated. The place is usually busy so service might slack. Only reason why this place gets 4 vs 5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here on a Sunday evening. The place was packed, but it only took 15min for my food to be ready to go. I had never had dosa before, but enjoy Indian food. I ordered the Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa and it was excellent. I would recommend Guru Lukshmi."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with friends. They had made the reservation earlier so we didn't have to wait but there was a line for waiting. So try to make a reservation in advance if you can. Food was good. We had dahi vada salty, dahi vada sweet, rasam vada and rasam as appetizers. All were very good. Rasam was very nicely done. All the dosas we ordered we good too. Place seemed a little too crowded and felt a little rushed but thats understandable with all the people waiting. Good place to go for authentic dosa."}
{"text":"After finding this jewel on my first business trip to Mississauga, I have returned on each of my subsequent trips.  The dosas are outstanding.  They have just about every type of dosa you would want, and they will adapt the spice level to your tastes (though they tend to be less spicy than you think, so if you like your food spicy hot, err on the side of asking for your dosa to be more spicy).    The restaurant can be crowded. The last time I was there, it was a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and we had to wait for a table.  But the wait was only 15 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Living in downtown Toronto, I am always down to take the 40 minute ride outside of the city for the simple purpose of eating a Gurulukshmi dosa.   I have moved around quite a bit in the past few years, and my search for a dosa that tastes even slightly similar to the ones in Bombay and Delhi had not ended until I found this hidden gem in the GTA. Regardless of what day and time you go, this tiny restaurant is always packed. The tables are small and they do their best to squeeze in as many people as possible. Despite the wait and serious lack of personal space, the dosas here are truly worth it.    My favourite is their Chettinad Dosa. It's incredibly spicy, and the waiters never forget to tell this white chick every time I order it. Perspiring from under the eyes, this dosa is worth the pain you may feel for the rest of the day. It's amazingly yummy. I have tried several of their other dosas as well - spinach, rava, paper, mysore -- all so, so good.  Their little slogan under the sign outside says \"your search for a good dosa ends here\", and they aren't lying."}
{"text":"I love this place, despite how packed it is. I ordered the kara masala dosa at 75% spice. And it did NOT disappoint. Im not a big fan of the aloo masala, but its just to tone down the spicyness of the dosa itself, so I cant complain. Love the blend of spices in the sambar, and absolutely love the chutneys. Honestly imo  this is one of the best (if not the best) dosa places ive been to, (including the south-indian  restaurants Ive been to in India).   The service is fast. But we had to wait a bit to be seated despite having a reservation. And tue reservation took soooo long to book. The phone rang for a solid 10 minutes before the machine answered...and to talk to an actual person...it toom 5 more.   Other than the hunger games you had to play to book a table. This place is great!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Quick service! Best variety of dosa I have tried in north america."}
{"text":"Food is kind of OK,  but service is bad-when you get the food on the table- serving staff only only do too much rush means eat and get out from the resturant Can not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"AWESOME!! I would give it all 5 stars if the seating was a bit better. I would however like to say that today (10/31/2010) was my first visit and I was not even a bit, disappointed by the service... so I guess the negative service reviews have helped.  OVERALL: I found the staff to be courteous and helpful and upon my asking them what they would recommend, I was suggested a couple of things off the menu... I ordered the first thing the guy ordered and was delighted to receive it.  TASTE: The taste was BETTER than my last recollecting of South Indian food while I was in India... it was better than Udupi (Gerard St., Toronto) and LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than Madras Dosa Hut... My wife ordered the usual \"Onion Rava Masala Dosa\"... that too was out of the world and we shared amongst ourselves... all in all, a wonderful experience, yes, the ambiance is lacking and there are snarling lineups but the food makes up for it all! A+++ Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Finest South Indian cuisine around... highly recommended!!  Must try when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food. Can't say anything bad about the food.  Service is often slow but always friendly."}
{"text":"Before you think this is another one of those people who has high expectations from a restaurant, let me tell you that I'm the kinda of person who usually thinks like that about other reviewers, but this was different. I've been a regular customer at this restaurant with my family of 4 and we've been more than patient with their unimaginably long wait times even though most of the times we do reserve our table. However, our last visit (actually I'm writing this review as I sit here) was a bit unpleasant. We only had to wait 5 or so minutes but were not properly escorted to our table, the restaurant representative just kinda pointed it out to us wile we stood in the middle of the restaurant looking around for the table. After we did sit down, the waiter came around rather early for our order and in his exact words ( looking at the kitchen door and neither of us at the table), \"Ready?\", Which was followed by a pause by all of us as we weren't sure what he actually said. I eventually realized he was asking us if we knew what we were going to order after 30 seconds of getting the menu handed to us. When he came around the next time to ask us, we were ready with our order, however my sister in law was going through the menu (after pacing her order) which he literately snatched from her hands and said to my mom, \" keep that \". My experience at this restaurant has been nothing short of my expectations until now."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in town and I am a frequent visitor. My favourite dosa is spring Kara dosa with cheese although  I have tried almost everything on their menu. Service has improved over the years. Little expensive than other dosa joints but the food quality justifies their price."}
{"text":"Good dosa...be prepare for long wait during weekends...glad, we had reservation.  Ordered diffent dosa for group... Mysore paper masala was good...as well as the green chilli dosa... Onion chilli uttapam was ok... Sambhar was nice... Dosa Served with three chutney...coconut, green and red...all three were ok."}
{"text":"Dosa are fresh n tasty. Ambiance is modern. However the place is too busy for a family to relax n eat. The server pushes to order even before you sit. I refused 3 times to order until they served water. Server are mainly international students who are under pressure, under paid and dont know much about hospitality. The cook should avoid salted butter on a butter dosa. It is expensive than other dosa places. I generally go this place to entertain my guests. It is not my personal favorite place though."}
{"text":"Great Dosa's from a South Indian residing in New York who has consumed Dosa's his whole life and born in India! Clean place with interesting twist on the traditional Dosa's."}
{"text":"We were on tour to Brampton and  cousin gave us treat at this restaurant. It's so crowded that it certify for serving quality food. Typical Indian atmosphere with everyone talking loudly and long waiting time . Never go without booking table ,but it's really good place for quality and variety of South Indian items."}
{"text":"me and my family visited this place not a clean place to visit not enough staffs and the food was more like gujarathi they need to hire Punjabi cook cause i know north ondian food when i taste one  cause i have ben living in India  issapointed  came in thinking a proper south indian restaurant but not clean at all the food and how we we served was dissapointing too They need to improve if they want good customers to visit them..  We went to this place thinking it was an authentic one as i have lived  in india doing a project particularly in south. I found  this place more sri lankan than indian this seems to be the norm nowadays,all in the menu seem to be copied and pasted from other real south indian restaurants Now why do that be a proud sri lankan  and stick to sri lankan food rather trying to be someone else ? Very disappointed after tasting the food i am sure non in this establishment  even lived in india to know whats south indian food.  or may be i am biased!!!  Do we we really need to be Indian to cook authentic Indian food or Italian to cook Tasty authentic Italian food.!!!!  Oops the owner Guru of Gurulukshmi  is a Sri Lankan and his place does good dosas. so go figure it out......Rick N. Oakville, ON.. wow Rick went to 2 dosa places at the same time and same date Ricks comment wow i am back again in Mississauga one of the first thing i did is to visit my favourate Dosa place.I was not dissapointed the taste is the same  (owners cook of course) Its nice to see they have again  expanded the place looks fantastic.So now i believe more people can dine in... Thank God Finally i can go with my family and friends to a proper south Indian vegetarian  Dosa Restaurant.i have lived in South India (Then Madras) so i know all about Dosas.. these guys have exceeded my expectations ... They way they are running the restaurant is fantastic.Authetic  food is great Mouth watering and clean..ambience perfect and i heard they are expanding again to accomodate for big parties great so no more waitng still i recomend anyone who wants to go on weekends to reserve before you go..   No need to put other dosa places down just because you own one. Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Nice South Indian food.  Good ambience, fast service. Coriander masala dosa, Mysore masala dosa and madras filter coffee are excellent. Reasonable prices make the place a must visit."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch and were accommodated very quickly even though it was very busy. The food was very authentic and delicious. Everything we ordered was perfect.  They need to improve on the service. I believe they need more servers or the servers need to be assigned sections. If not for their poor service, I would give them 5 stars. If possible, make reservations before you go. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"1) The horrible reservation experience when there is no communication between man outside and the person actually provides table at any order.   2) Food is good and served fast but its not something you must try category not for costly   3) Waiters have no common sense of saying hi/hello or thank you/have a nice day (even after providing 15% tip!)   When you get sense that there is no point in doing reservation for rude service it too late."}
{"text":"The dining experience at Guru Lakshmi was lack lustre and a complete let down. When we arrived at the restaurant after making reservations in advance, we were seated behind the service counter. During the service our chairs were constantly pushed by aggressive, fast moving employees who had zero respect for our personal space. Why anyone would design a seating arrangement behind a cash counter is beyond me.  After we sat down and were brought menus and water, we noticed that at least 3 glasses were dirty. One glass had actually had lipstick on it another had a large crack. There's obviously little care with cleanliness at this establishment.   All food orders were inputted into an iPad which was impressive, however, this was short lived. The instructions put on the orders including having aloo masala in dosas and varying spice levels were not followed.   We ordered various dosas including paneer dosas, spinach dosas, paper dosas, rava dosa, and Malaysian style  tofu dosa. Honestly there is absolutely nothing special about these dosas. They are run of the mill that you can get anywhere. The chutneys were all watered down, clearly the secret to stretching their chutneys for days.  Do not go here unless you like to pay money for poor service and mediocre food. Go to Saravanaa Bhavan in Mississauga or Scarborough, they will at least treat you like a paying customer.  We even asked to speak to manager about the poor service. Not only did she refuse, the waiter laughed when we said we were not satisfied with the service.  Horrible place and people."}
{"text":"Whatever opinion you have of south indian food esp dosa's please leave them at the door. This place is not for the weak hearted though they do have some non spicy dosa's.  I was simply blown by the variety of dosa's this place has. The Green chilli dosa is the best."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience.  The food and service leave nothing to be desired. My Masala dosa and my husband's cheese dosa were delicious!! The chutneys and sambhar were freshly prepared and just the perfect level of spiciness. Idlis were great too. The only item that was average was the gulab jamuns. Overall, best South Indian I have tried in the GTA to date."}
{"text":"Excellent dosa and Idli place. South Indian food for those who do not know what the first sentence meant.   The sambhar is excellent here and all in all you can bet the food is going to be great every time you go there.   The service is fast but reserve coz it is packed pretty much all the time.   The surprise here is the desert - you wouldn't expect but I would say the only good desert is 'Ras Malai' that is North Indian desert but this one is better than most other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent food..quick service..nice interiors..advisable to be there before 9pm as by 9.45 they are in a rush to wind up..so it's a lil awkward to eat quickly when u go for a relaxed weekend dinner..but all in all..a super favourite and a must go..please open some more branches!"}
{"text":"Besides the waiting st the front and the constant 'can I get you anything else' the food is amazing! !! I HIGHLY AND STRONGLY recommend making reservations and arriving 15 mins earlier."}
{"text":"4/5. Usually not a fan of South Indian food but this place is amazing. I recommend the chaat dosa or rava onion dosa. Those who can take spice try the Malaysian tofu dosa. Very creative options! Must have the coffee!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very tasty food. Love that it is all vegetarian and shows the variety and deliciousness of a vegetarian diet and lifestyle."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Great service. Nice food. Family place. Being with my friends ordered set dosa mini idli chilli uttapam cheese uttapam Mysore masala dosa mini tiffin"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because of the amazing reviews on Yelp. Sad to say but I was very disappointed in the mediocre food but mostly the subpar service.   Food Pakoras- these were pretty good. Spicy and crispy. Comes with two sauces the mint and the coconut. Mint is delicious, coconut not so much. It tasted too sweet to eat with something savory and spicy.   Poori with Vegetable Korma- Pooris were delicious, soft and fluffy, nice texture. The Vegetable Korma was okay, nothing life changing.   Mysore Dosa- this wasn't necessarily bad but It was expecting more flavor given it had been endorsed by the Toronto Star. It was crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. Nice texture contrast. The filling i found was mostly potatoes. I was expecting the potato filling to be tastier. Basically the dosa was a potato mash with onions and green pepper stuffed in a crepe with 4 sauces to dip it in. The sambhar was the saving grace of this dish. It was full of flavor and spicy. The coconut and mint was the same sauce that came with the pakora. The last one Im not sure what it was, it looked like a tikka masala sauce but tasted like diluted spicy tomato sauce.   Dessert- i didn't get to order one because the check was slapped on our table before I could. Which brings me to service...  We came at a tuesday evening at 7. Restaurant was busy but not full. We were seated and our orders was promptly taken which was a good start. Then it was down hill from there. Knowing we ordered two apps to share they didnt bother giving us plates. Fine, I'll eat off the plate then, luckily i was with my fiancé so we were pretty comfortable eating off one plate. Then the mains came while we were still finishing the apps. I finally finished my poori and stacked the plates on the side to make room for the gigantic dosa. No one cleared the appetizer plates from the table until i was halfway finished with my dosa. Unacceptable! Especially since multiple waiters passed by us ignoring the stack of plates. I had to keep calling their attention for more water or napkins. I would think that at a restaurant that serves mostly spicy food  they would make it a priority that their patrons stay hydrated. They should assign one of the waiters to make sure the whole restaurant has water. God knows there was enough waiters walking around aimlessly. They seem very disorganized. From what I observed from customers beside us... A waiter ask a diner who just ordered if she already ordered (clearly they dont communicate with each other) And the other waiter entered the wrong order 3 times on the family that sat next to us. The pièce du resistance was having the bill slapped on our table as I was still eating. Unbelievable!   Long story story short... I would have to be really craving a Dosa to go back to this place and even then I would just do take out. The food is nothing life changing. I would go to Gurus at Heartland instead."}
{"text":"I am from California bay area and have been to many south indian restaurants here, but Guru Lukshmi hands down has the best dosa I have had in North America! We were visiting Toronto and decided to have dinner here on a weekday. Considering it was weekday I did not make reservations so there was a wait time of 45 minutes :( But I was pretty amazed at the way they managed the people waiting without chaos. We ordered idli, chettinad masala dosa and garlic butter dosa. Everything was very tasty but chettinad masala dosa was the best! Very spicy!  Overall we are glad we visited Guru Lukshmi, great food and good hospitality. Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"It hard to judge as it was for pick up and I had to drive about 20min before we ate it. The flavours were great and it was tasty. I would definitely go back to eat in the restaurant. The only issue is that the menu is a bit hectic to understand."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and was happy to try out their South Indian specialities including Dosas. Food is really good but they could improve on their speed of advice as it tends to get very busy in evenings."}
{"text":"Excellent food  I usually just get the classic masala dosa I don't want to mess around too much with a good thing.  If you are looking for variety there are many options to choose from  I have tasted the chaat masala dosa it is good , little salty Coriander dosa is good  Chana dosa is good   Also get some mini idly to share   The desserts all have a little savoury note to them but if you like the cardamom savoury flavour in your dessert then go right ahead, I'm told those are great too"}
{"text":"The five stars here is for the dosa  - this is best,authentic  dosa we've tasted in a very long time! the chutneys they serve with the dosa's are all fresh...(each dosa comes with 3 chutneys - coconut, coriander and tomato along with sambhar)  Not only do they give you a variety of dosa's (both standard and unique) and south indian fare to choose for but they give you choices! You can order the spice level for both the sambhar and dosa. You can choose no oil, little oil or regular. And the best, drum roll, you can order the dosa crispy or soft!!  The sambhar is good as the dosa and its just very satisfying.   We've been there twice now and have not been disappointed.   We also get the chocolate dosa which is basically the dosa with nutella spread - it looks like a crepe - so yummy! Other new variations are pav bhaji dosa, mysore bhaji dosa, and coriander dosa...all tasty!  Also for all the Jains/Swaminarayans out there - they have onion and garlic free items on the menu :)  The only negative is the seating and the organization. The place is always packed and it doesn't appear they've really figured out an efficient mechanism. Here's to hoping they work it out!! (otherwise highly recommend going at an \"off\" time.) Our first time we waited for an hour! (well worth it tho!)"}
{"text":"This is no doubt the BEST Dosa place in the GTA!  When we got there I heard the guy taking the reservations say there was a 2.5 hour wait for tables! Glad I called and made a reservation. We were in fact seated ten minutes early.Dosa and everything else we had was awesome. I didn't eat food this good when I was in South India, so if you love Dosa, Wada, Uttappam etc etc. It costs a little more than most other places but it is definitely worth it, no questions asked. You MUST come here. Lots of free parking and the service is also top notch."}
{"text":"Reservations don't mean much to them.  1 pm reservation, seated at 1:30 pm.  Stood outside in cold for 30 min before being seated and that too on separate tables. Staff told us to go sit in our cars and they would get us. Only 3 menus given for 8 people. service from staff was slow never set the table, never took the plates away. Owner was nice and made up for it on his own. Food was good, it's the rest that took the score down. Food didn't come out at once, in fact one person was forgotten."}
{"text":"AWESOME and DELICIOUS MASALA DOSA !!  5 stars for Quality, Service, Quantity, and Ambiance.  I ordered steamed Masala Dosa(dosa prepared without oil), it was really good."}
{"text":"The quality of food and service have both seriously dropped at the new location. The new location has still has a crowded atmosphere inside in a bigger place.   Well based upon what myself, my family and friends feel, that people have no other choice at this point, so they just happen to tolerate the bad service and the food; but mark our words, that If and when a new restaurant comes around the corner, guru Lakshmi is just going to drain out in no time. Bad bad bad customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"As always, hands down the best dosa place in the GTA. If you like Indian food, you HAVE to try it. You will definitely enjoy it. Prices are very good here as well and the dosas are pretty huge."}
{"text":"Best doses throughout GTA!  Nothing else beats.  I've been to saravana after that but it wasn't nearly as good.  This place is always busy and the turn around us super quick!  Live the mysore bhaji dosa :))"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but always on a weeknight. I've tried to go for dinner on a weekend which is disastrous. You could be waiting for up to 2 hours or more. I refuse to wait that long to eat and frankly, the food isn't that good that I'd wait so long for it.   Now on to the service: friendly wait staff. Drinks took an unusually long time to make it to the table but that's a very minor thing.   Food: our table ordered the mini idlis, Mysore paper dosa, rava masala dosa, butter paper masala dosa, chili cheese dosa, and pizza uttapam.  Everyone loved the food, except for the pizza uttapam. The tasted like the batter was undercooked and still a bit raw.  Highly recommend the Mysore paper dosa. It's crispy and loaded with a light spice flavour.   The restaurant is also very clean. No complaints about the food or service. I just wouldn't wait 2 hours to eat here."}
{"text":"This review is just for the customer service.I called today to make a reservation, the guy on the phone confirmed my reservation for 9:15pm cutting me off in between being very rude. My husband and I reached there 15 mins before our reservation and learnt from one of the employees yelling at the door they're running late. Rude again!! I get it's always busy there but it is busy because of us 'the people' who give you the business. Be kind to them. I finally managed to pass through the crowded waiting room outside to talk to front person who was seating everyone. I told him I made a reservation for 9:15 under the name of.. i'm going to sit in the car, please call me. He said thank you so much i will call you, without paying much attention to the list he had in his hand to double check and turned away. Well I went to the car waited for 5 mins and something in my gut said something is not right. I went again to the over crowded waiting room and a guy in front of the restaurant door ask my name, what time i called, whether i talked to a boy or a girl, and after asking more random questions told me their reception is closed after 5pm. My answer to that was, well your employee picked up the call and booked my reservation for 9:15pm. He kept quite and didn't say anything after. It was 9:30 and still waiting. I went to the guy to the same guy again and asked him whether my name is even written?!? He said NO. When were u planning on telling me?! He said I can seat u in at 10pm. Thats 45mins late than my reservation time!!! I finally walked out. Hungry and Angry!   To the owner I have been a loyal customer of your finger licking food ever since you first opened your restaurant in the basement of a mall. When you were hardly known. You have managed to maintain the quality if the food however have forgotten to train your staff in customer service. They're obnoxious, rude and today I felt as if someone was doing me a favour by letting me eat at your restaurant 45 mins after my reservation!!  Truly disappointed and you did lose a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Anytime I have a craving for dosas, Guru Lukshmi is my go-to spot. It is preferred if you make a reservation ahead of time, as this place is very popular and there always seems to be a line up. I happened to arrive 15 minutes prior to opening hours on Saturday and was still third in line to get a table. The food is made with love and the flavours are mouth-watering. If you like spicy, flavorful food, this is the right place to eat. I tried Chettinad Dosa with cheese. I wasn't sure if adding cheese would take away from the authenticity of the dosa, but I felt it just added to the texture and flavour of the dish. I've tried the Mysore Bhaji dosa, which was featured in the Toronto Star newspaper, and it continues to be one of my favourite dosas at Guru Lukshmi. Definitely recommend this place for the food. The long waits might be off-putting to some, but if you have the time, it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was told to go here by my co-workers and they did not disappoint ! I got the Dosa Masala, take out. It was delicious, and the chutney was very flavourful. I would recommend sitting in for Dosa as you do not want it to get soggy. They were fast for takeout however. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing south indian restaurant... you cant afford to miss this place if you are near brampton or missisuaga... Take reservation before visiting since it is full most of the time... the variety of dosas available is very good."}
{"text":"Easily the best southern Indian food in NA. Most of the items are as good as you can get them in India. This is a must visit place if you are in Toronto area.  What is disappointing is Coffee. With a Tim Hortons every 50 yards and an insatiable demand for coffee in Canada, I am shocked that no Indian restaurant can replicate a good southern Indian Coffee.  There are some easy pickings for those who can market Indian coffee better."}
{"text":"Delicious dosas! Great service, nice ambiance- what more can you ask for!!  There are lots of variety of dosas and the menu has a good description of each, so you aren't afraid to try different kinds.   Make sure to make reservations though!!"}
{"text":"I had read about this place and I knew we had to try it out!  First thing we noticed is that we were the ONLY non Indian peeps in the joint.  No matter!  Bring out the dosas!   Idly and the vada app combo: *Idly tastes like Ethopian injera-kinda fermented, no flavour otherwise, that's why you dip it into the three sauces that accompanies it.    Masala dosa: *Crisp and light, filled with a savoury filling of potatoes and onions.    Mysore paper dosa: *Good name eh?  Anyhoo-it was a larger dosa, red in colour, spread thinly with a garlic and chili paste.  Had a bit of a kick to it.  Same texture, crisp and light.  Now, my only complaint is that personally, I found the dosas quite greasy; we needed a lot of napkins.     We couldn't finish our food, and at first I mocked my sister for ordering so little, but now, I hang my head in shame.  It was too much food!!!     All this food plus 1 mango lassi and 1 Limca came to $33.90 including 10% service charge.  I'll be back soon to try out more interesting dosas!   ***Tip***Go early because after we left around 8:30 pm, there was a HUGE crowd outside waiting to get a table.  We also noticed that there were very few people in 2's, most were in large groups.   If you're in a hurry, get take out.  Also, be prepared for a wait, you'll be asked to give your phone number, and will be told to wait in your car. :p   ***Note***This place is vegetarian!!! But you won't miss the meat!"}
{"text":"Ok as everyone that actually ever ate here or read about dosas would know that this place has made it's way into the hall of fame for this cuisine so let's not get into the good as it's settled that food is great but let me tell me what to watch out for: 1. Make a reservation and try to come in small groups as otherwise you will be disappointed  2. Be very clear when you are ordering and ask the server to repeat if need be a few times to ensure no mistake - as with busy crowds and rush they tend to get the order mixed up - otherwise service is with a smile :) 3. In my opinion the lassi's were off - salty was too salty and sweet was too sweet and mango shake was more like mango juice   Finally tips to the owners to help solve wait problems  1. Get wireless buzzers / or give waiting guests tickets to know who came first as often parties that come late find a way to get accommodated and those that are patiently waiting tend to be forgotten  2. I think it's time to expand - literally your neighboring stores are dependent on your business and people waiting in line tend to go there to grab a snack! I'm certain you can negotiate a bigger place :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a connoisseur of South Indian food, but I have to say that if you want to try a great dosa and experience South Indian food I would recommend Guru Lukshmi.  Both the food and service is excellent.  The Mysore paper dosa or best seller is an excellent dosa.    Its very busy though, so be warned that you have to either prepare to wait or come earlier to get a seat."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is not bad.  But if you are looking for a wholesome experience--avoid this place.  The staff is rude and in attempts to maximize their profits they rush you, overbook reservations and there is always a waiting period even after having made reservations two hours in advance.  Their management is extremely poor and customer service is subpar.  You pay evening dining prices but the quality of service is like going to a street vendor for their dosas.  Better alternatives include Saravana Bhavan and Nilgiri's."}
{"text":"I have been eating their food since they started over 10 years ago in a food court.  The fact that they have grown so much, and are always busy is testament to the quality of their food.  I must say their dosas (onion rava masala is my go to dosa) are truly amazing.  The sambhar vadas are fantastic as well.  You also can't go wrong with the uttapams.  I guess everything is great, and is comparable to the best you can get in India!"}
{"text":"Tried dosas at various places in GTA but not even one close to Gurulukshmi. This is really a passionate cook running this restaurant. It's a ritual for us to go atleast once a month. Their Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa, Corriander Masala dosa, Zeera Malhi Dosas are few which stand out. I give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation as I don't know much about Indian food.. And I was pleased.   The environment seemed upscale for a strip mall restaurant and was full. This is a vegetarian restaurant and I had the Dosa.. Spicy.  This was tasty. I found it a little oily.. But I found out later that you can request a no oil option.   I will be trying this again"}
{"text":"We had heard so many good things about Guru Lukshmi and finally got a chance to drop by for Indian breakfast this past weekend. We made reservations, considering the popularity of this place!  The restaurant itself has a fun black decor and the service staff is excellent! Now, coming to the food! We ordered  1) idly Medhu vada combo - both the idly and vada were very fresh and well prepared.   2) Poori Kurma - the poories (deep fried bread) were a tad oily but tasted great. Kurma (a mixed vegetable dish) was well prepared.  3) Chettinad Cheese Dosa - the dosa itself was great but we wish we hadn't ordered the Chettinad style. The Chettinad style was just the same regular dosa with a ton of chilli powder in it. This overpowered the taste of everything else - the dosa itself and the potato in it. Keep it simple and just order the masala dosa.   4) Filter Coffee - this didn't match up to my expectation of filter coffee and can be avoided.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and we will return soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in to check it out and got served right away. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"My dosa was stuck to the plate so it made it a little difficult to eat. Food came out very fast and was decent. Dosa is 85% of the menu, so you better be in the mood for it.  FYI they have spoons at every table but no forks. No liquor license."}
{"text":"The food is great and authentic. It's the only reason I keep coming back here. I always get the sambar vada and idly to start. Tried the pav bajji dosa for the first time and loved it. The new renovations are looking good too, and it's great they have more room now.  They lost points because the service was subpar. I'm usually very accommodating and easy when it comes to service, but I was disappointed today. My last experience was awesome service wise. Maybe they just need to make numbers to pay for the renovations. Menus being tossed at us, being handed the bill before asking, having plates taken away while still eating, not being given cutlery to eat with, are all things I find unacceptable for a fine dinning restaurant.  Still, if you you aren't fussy about that, and want to eat good, quality, authentic dosa, I will recommend Guru Luksmi. I will probably be visiting too when my recollection of the bad service has faded."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for the food as one of the best dosas in town but it comes with a price. I'm not talking $ but huge attitude especially during rush hours. They treat you like cow herds! Forget reservations even if you are ready to wait and that too in Toronto winters for an hour it only means outside as they don't have place to accommodate you inside. They are rude and lose temper when line gets longer.   Here's a tip (without the bill ;-): Hire someone who can 'manage' your crowds and make your facility more 'welcoming' to guests especially the ones waiting! It would go long way.."}
{"text":"what an over the price over exaggerated place for dosas and sambars man...sri lankans make better sambar are so much easier on your pocket.... another one thinks they are better than others so will charge more...nothing special not even one thing I can pick to say yup maybe go for that...chatni they serve like they doing a favor...saala ....gandu log"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with 4 others friends, for something different as one of my friend is vegetarian. I must say this is the best Dosa I have ever had in my life. With lots of variety to chose from and different levels of spices this is the go to place, make sure to make a reservation a head of time as it gets busy.. Although the food was good I felt like they were rushing us to leave, other than that great food 5/5 service was 4/5."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing service and food!  I've been here many times.  The food quality and flavour is amazing.  Quite possibly the best dosa place in North America!"}
{"text":"amazing ! Service 5 out of 5 ! Food 5 out of 5 ! Their upma was just amazing !! We had 4 types of dosas. a) paneer (5 out of 5) , b) Mushroom 4 out of 5 c) Coriander 5 out 5 and Chilli dosa 5 out of 5 :)"}
{"text":"Stellar food, authentic South Indian cuisine, absolutely delicious.   The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is because if you don't have a reservation you'll have a hard time getting in.  And even when you do have a reservation, they'll try to rush out you during peak business hours so that they can maximize on their profits."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Thought I would try Indian food, hadn't had it in a long time but this made me remember why. Why all the hype?"}
{"text":"The crust was good, the stuffing not so much. Not worth the hype but pretty good nonetheless"}
{"text":"My mother brought home takeout from this place. I have read the raves on Yelp and was eager to try this spot! I don't know exactly what I ordered but it was delicious. Simple vegetarian food, chutneys were so good. One was a white coconut, mint, and a spicy sauce. All delicious on the rice too. I will dine in next time to have fresh dosas."}
{"text":"Quick review...ordered some appetizers and the Paper Masala Dosa (larger and crispier version of regular Masala Dosa).  Service speed was good and the atmosphere was nice.  It's good that they take reservations since they can get pretty busy especially on weekends, but they are very strict about having all members of the party there before they will seat you. I guess that is a good policy. They will also boot you after an hour or so which as someone else mentioned is not always enough time to eat especially with kids.  Dosa itself was good, but not the best I've had.  It was waay too crispy to the point where it all broke apart.  The potato and onion stuffing was good although it was full of fresh cilantro which I asked not be put on mine.  Had to send it back.  I along with my sister also got a strong ghee (clarified butter) taste on certain parts of our dosas.  Next time I will make sure to ask that no ghee be used since it does not enhance the flavour and can be off-putting if you are not used to the taste.  Also tried a bite of the kids Cheese Dosa which was really yummy.  The sambar is very spicy but they also have a mild version if you ask.  Overall this place is 3 stars and I hope to try some of the other unique dosas next time I visit.  However, Udapi Palace on Gerrard St is still my favourite place for dosa in the GTA."}
{"text":"GREAT food! Just be prepared to wait in line. The wait times are long here if you dont come at the right time. They are also only opened for limited hours so make sure you check the hours before you come. It is definitely worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. We went as a large group and tried multiple types of disaster - every one of them was delicious. I could go back again anyway.  Took out one star only because of their service. It was fast and efficient but could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Very good south indian food. Courteous staff and very reasonably priced. Very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"We were served Andhra dosa which had spinach paste inside ! We did realise it was not what we wanted as pic of Andhra dosa in their menu looked completely different than what we had been given ! Although they insisted it was still Andhra dosa , we totally knew it was not the rit one and requested it to be taken back ! Next came unexpectedly to us, but we were offered another dosa and were not charged for the andhra one ! Professional and gracious attitude towards their guests ! Food is served with great care and devotion which is what matters the most ! Amazing experience  :)"}
{"text":"The food is really good and deserves more stars than what I have given. The downside is that it is too congested and the fact that it is almost always crowded only makes matters worse. If you are a couple, always remember there are at-least eight people listening to everything you say sitting on either side of you and they don't have a choice either!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favourite places. The wide selection of dosa is great. My all time favourite is the panner dosa. The staff is friendly and the service is great. It's a great place to dine in and get takeout. Highly recommended if you enjoy south indian food."}
{"text":"What can I say about Guru Lukshmi... For sure it's an experience in itself. We walked into this whole production unexpectedly and it was really cool - although probably cool for us since we were out of town on vacation. I don't know how others deal with it on a regular basis. :)  So I was randomly yelping Indian restaurants in Mississauga, since we were visiting Toronto. Everyone's heard of the Indian crowds there. I ran across GL and we decided to drop by for dinner. It was a bit of a hike from the city, but we get there like... 9:10pm and noticed some CRAZINESS! :) There were people out the door jam packed! Talk to the guy, and he's like there's a 1.5 hour wait. Nuts... never experienced that at an Indian restaurant.  The kids were hungry, so we put our name down and actually took the kids to Taco Bell. :-) I know... it's big in America. Hadn't had it on the entire trip, and the kids jumped up like they saw Santa when I mentioned there was one like 5 miles away. Can you imagine? A dinner adventure before dinner?  So then we get back and it's still like 30 minutes to go. We were chit chatting with the host and all and some of the other seated guests - recon before the big showdown... Found out they not only do dosas, but they have innovative kinds of dosas. Like, Pao Bhaji Dosa, Khaara Dosa, etc. The menu had probably like 40 different kinds of dosas. We're reading the articles about this place and how many times they've had to expand and they still have 1.5 hour waits.  We finally get seated and then it hits you. Service. Indian restaurants can be as popular as the Backstreet Boys, but Indian service is going to remain Indian service. There was a bunch of confusion and miss-steps throughout the experience. They don't seem to have assigned waiters for the tables, so we had numerous people stopping by with updates, questions, etc. One person was like, the waitress couldn't \"get\" the order so he came to confirm it. One lady said they were out of Mango Lassi for the night and then 3 minutes later they brought us some. The guy was like, they were just making more. I could go on and on with these things, but really, the star of GL is the food, so I will move on.  Idli Sambhar - Loved them. Comes with coconut and this spicy chutney. Sambhar was good and the idlis were just the right texture. Not too hard and not too squishy either. Great start.  Onion Rava Masala Dosa - what was better about this than other places was that it was very thin and crispy. Thinner than most places I've had it. I had the masala on the and it was just a great dosa. The dosas all came with the coconut and spicy chutney, and also this green minty one. I like the first two most.  Butter Masala Dosa - I didn't have this one, but it looked great. Those that were eating it enjoyed it.  Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa - So I tasted this one and it was very unique. Basically, they had mixed in some Pau Bhaji masala into the Mysore Masala, so it was a mixture of those of those flavors. Very interesting. Personally, I would stick to the basics, especially when trying a new place. I'm glad someone else ordered this one and I got to taste it. Overall, very crispy, flavorful, and good.  Badam Halwa - I really liked it. Others I was with said it was too sweet - more sugar than the norm, but I thought it was great. It comes in a really small portion, probably because it's quite rich, and very good.  As I mentioned, Guru Lukshmi was an interesting experience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our evening with as many adventures as it had. Best dosa in North America? Well, better than other ones I've had in North America. Actually, with some of the variety, it may be the ONLY place where you can get some of these dosas at all. Definitely recommend GL for someone in the area. Oh, and supposedly they take reservations so definitely call ahead."}
{"text":"If this was my regular place to eat, I'd have a coronary heart attack by the time I'm 35.   That said, it's definitely a place worth checking out if you have the heart for some Indian dosa with some spice but be aware of the ghee, butter cause it's heavy.    I found a single dosa to be gigantic and definitely filling with many to choose from.  You will be amazed with size and mostly the taste.    The dosa's are meant to be eaten with your hands so be sure to wash your hands and fingers before eating them and also if you're not familiar with this be sure to ask for extra napkins.   Meanwhile, wash you're meal down with a nice Lasi or Limca.  By the time you're done your hunger will be easily satisfied.     Definitely come back every few months or if you can handle the spice and ghee, hey it's your heart not mine.   Guru is about 20-25 mins from downtown Toronto.   The wait can be long at times so come prepared."}
{"text":"There is no doubt the food is great and most importantly its very consistent. But the service is very rude and abrupt. I wanted to make a reservation for friday for a birthday celebration for a group of 8 and i was told either i have to be prepared to sit in two separate tables or arrive at 5. It is one of the priciest desi restaurant and it has a an attitude of a 3 michelin star french bistro. I would not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place serves amazing dosas...my husband and I visit this place regularly...great food nice service"}
{"text":"These dosa's are pretty awesome. They've got an excellent variety of them and seem to always be packed even."}
{"text":"Well the stain on my shirt hasn't fully dried yet, so I'm hopeful I am able to extract some taste later as the dosas exceeded my poor little California heart's expectations! Friendly staff as my first-timer doe eyes looked around awaiting the cultural experience I wasn't ready for. The tastiness of the dosas made me want to head back again for breakfast. Get a reservation and go home satisfied. Fantastic quality all around. If I'm ever in this area again, will DEFINITELY return."}
{"text":"First, I would like to stay I don't think the Indian food scene here in Toronto is that great. Toronto excels at a lot of different cultures, however I have yet to find a decent Indian food place let alone a dosa place.   I had very little expectations going to Guru Lukshmi however they have beyond exceeded my expectations. After having tried authentic Indian dosas from the best dosa shops in India, Gutu Lukshmi did an excellent job at keeping the authentic flavors of India.   They are able to customize the dosa if you need it to be Jain. We tried the mini idli, masala dosa, and paneer dosa. And it was amazing!! The mini idlis were absolutely delicious and the dosas were wonderful. The place is small and packed so it's a good idea to get reservations.   I recommend this place for any dosa lover and would be returning here quite soon. Definitely would love to try the rest of the menu items and glad at least there is a decent dosa place in the GTA while I struggle to find a decent Indian food place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to this place. There is always a wait to get a table which in my books is a good thing. We have dropped in a few time with no reservations and with the expectation to wait to get a table. Last week we made a reservation as my father in law was in from Vancouver and we knew he would love this place. We drove an hour  to guru lukshmi as we don't live locally. We arrived 830 (the time of our reservation) and no word of a lie there must and been a good 30 people outside waiting to be seated. We went to the front and they told us they didn't have our reservation. They said the next table available was at 10:15. There was no way we were going to wait 2 hours and 15 minutes to be seated after we made reservations. Isn't that the whole point of making a reservation? After a little bit of persistence we were seated within a half an hour. Someone in their end made a boo boo but they did end up accommodating with in a reasonable time frame considering how busy they were. None the less. THE FOOD IS TO DIE FOR. I am a Caucasian woman so my tolerance for spicy food isn't great but they are good with making all of their dishes mild when requested. I will be back here. No doubt about it"}
{"text":"The best dosas in GTA!! Try Mysore Masala, Pav Bhaji dosa, Spinach dosa and mini idlis soaked in Sambhar."}
{"text":"Little overpriced but I would pay without hesitation as food is worth it. I love paav bhaji dosa and paneer dosa. And madras coffee is a must try. Always do booking 1 or 2 days before else be ready to wait for 1.5 hours in waiting line"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Authentic taste. Reminds me of the Sambhar and Dosas you get in Mumbai!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ok don't get me wrong, the food is good.  But the service is so so and I think they are overrated.  There a more options than anywhere for Dosa.  And some of the appetizers are very tasty too.  It's a good restaurant.  Vegetarian only.  I like the food, I think pricing is ok. But I wouldn't wait in line for ages to get in.  Their menu is fine, but service can be improved."}
{"text":"Cool place that is known to my in-laws as the best dosa in the area. You can tell this place is popular and hectic, as the only reservations were for 9:15(!). I haven't had dosa in a long time so I was excited to try this place. I had the traditional mysore dosa, which in retrospect I shouldn't have gotten, as it was like 95% potatoes inside. My wife and her cousins got the pav bhaji dosa, which I tasted and definitely enjoyed more. We also split a paper dosa, which I really liked and I probably should have tried. This place had so many options that I wanted to try them all! One intriguing one was a mushroom dosa. Oh well, maybe next time I'm up north!"}
{"text":"Great spot! I've been many many times, always packed, always good!  I usually order a plain paper dosa with extra sambar and chutney. Done deal! Sometimes, I'll order medhu vada to share and remember my childhood in India.   Around $11-12 for most dosas, a bit higher than most but seriously, so delicious. You also get to pick how spicy (mild), oily (no oil) you would like it."}
{"text":"We were feeling like having a Dosa and I had bookmarked this place quite a while ago from the fellow Yelp friends postings. After reading some reviews I was very intrigued on the choices of Dosa they provided.   First of all, as mentioned in many reviews the place gets very packed so make sure you have reservation. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a good number of seatings. The service was quick and the lady was friendly.   Choices...Choices...Foodwise, we went with:  - Jeera Malli Dosa with aloo masala. This Dosa is suppose to be topped with crushed jeera, black pepper, fresh coriander.  - Pav Bhaji Dosa - This Dosa was stuffed with the bhaji (thick mix veg curry), topped with fresh onions, coriander.   Both Dosa were exceptionally good and the sauces were great with it. We also tried their mango shake and special Madras filter coffee which was great! & strong.  Overall, the experience was quite good."}
{"text":"Dinner & Lunch: Indian crepery   Ambience: 3/5-Functional & clean    Food: 4.5/5  Service: 3/5 (Friendly & efficient) Value: 5/5  Repeat: Already did. Probably the best in the city both in terms of quality and variety."}
{"text":"I got the ghee paper masala dosa. The dosa was buttery and delicious. The potato bhaji filling was so flavorful and not spicy..perfect for me!   We also had the vada in yogurt which was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Dosas really good! But not spectacular and this is supposed to be THE DOSA PLACE IN TOWN!   Ambiance is cafeteria style. They are in a rush to seat people and get them out!   They do take reservations, but no one answers the phone. So you have to email them. They do return those though.   Your entire party must be there or they will not seat you.   Overall, yes, food was good. Our server was very nice too. But host staff could use some work and it seems like way too many people packed in and just being rushed.   I would not suggest this place strongly."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised by this restaurant. I'm not a vegetarian, so I always hesitate going into a vegetarian Indian restaurant. But this place..... I'm just speechless. Ordered the Andra Dosa with aloo masala (the aloo masala is a must in my opinion). Also had chilli baji which surprisingly wasn't as spicy as what would've happened if you but into a typical chilli. Overall, great place! And it's always super packed!"}
{"text":"If you love dosas, this is the place to be. Guru has never disappointed. Always make reservations to avoid being disappointed. The signature dosas are awesome as well as their gulab Jamun.  If you are a fan of madras coffee then they have that as well. The vada's are also flavorful. A must try for all dosa lovers our there. Fast service. One thing is they try to get you in and out real quick."}
{"text":"Was here the week of Fourth of July. Widest range of selection of dosas. You name it, the have it. It was packed, understand they take reservations. I suggest you make one to avoid waiting. The wait could be really long- average 30 minutes. Excellent service. Because of the crowds they handle and the big group we had, they mixed up one dosa, but corrected it within minutes.  For dosas, I would rate it 6 stars but 5 is the max here."}
{"text":"delicious food, I had the 14 piece idly, which was very flavourful, there was also a powbhaji dosa and a kids meal dosa that was ordered. there were no complains about the food but the service was horrible.   we were seated at a table and felt extremely rushed to place an order when we hadn't even gotten our water yet. the host kept coming back every few mins with \"ready to order?\" and then because we were taking \"too long\" we were asked to move seats as the area we were sitting in was reserved for a party. WHY seat us somewhere knowing you have a larger party coming in? it was extremely annoying and to top it off, the staff started moving tables to the side of people who were already eat. I was so annoyed by that.   after getting moved tables our server changed and had a very hard time not only understanding us but also answering questions - we asked if we could have another person but that never happened.   overall, great food - but horrible service, this is my second time coming here and experiencing the same problem, not sure how I feel about returning."}
{"text":"Feeling the need to have a Dosa I headed to Gurulakshmi. Ordered just that. A Plain dosa. Came with three chutneys and sambar. The sambar was delicious. The dosa was too crispy for my liking. I was not made aware or asked if I liked it crispy or not. The chutneys were not impressive either. Be prepared to eat another dosa or order something else too because it is not going to satisfy your hunger. Filter coffee was also far from the real thing."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. If you're looking for delicious authentic Indian food then look no further.   The service is super quick and phenomenal. Staff is very polite and professional.   Would come back."}
{"text":"This has become my preferred place for South Indian food, particularly Dosas, Idlis and such. The food is very well done; and a really good introduction to South Indian food. Having said that, I'd say I have 2 reservations - they tend to be so busy that the sambar is really piping hot when served; and the service has been hit and miss. We've generally gone as a party of at least 6; and have had our orders not completed correctly or served in a coordinated fashion. I would play close attention if you've got a reasonable sized party. Recommended for the food."}
{"text":"I will agree to most of the reviews here about good food. Hands down it's tough to find Dosa place with such authentic taste. I find their place is too cramped and somehow not sure it's just me but their reservation system is weird. They won't allocate table unless all the guests are physically there. Also claiming to be providing best experience and charging .50c for Chutney doesn't sound good to me. Its not about $$ but I won't like a place charging additional for basic item."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and you pretty much need a reservation to get in. The food is so worth the sub par service. Every dosa I've tried has hit the spot.  Love the mango lassi and sweet lassi as well.  The speed of the service has gotten better since the last time I visited.  Best dosas in town"}
{"text":"Overhyped and overpriced. Food is honestly okay, I have yet to try something special there. The lassi was very nice. The rasam is a little more salty than necessary."}
{"text":"Had the Paneer dosa, it was delicious! It had onions, mozzarella cheese, paneer, green peppers, and a slightly saucy blend of spices. Incredibly flavorful and spicy:)"}
{"text":"Had the Garlic Dosa with cheese it was awesome. The Mango shakes and Kulfi add a nice touch for dessert."}
{"text":"great restaurant. i love the variety of dosas you can find here...the other dishes were good too...its always packed..."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant- the  authentic south Indian food, the ambience and decor and the customer service deserves a 5 star rating. Good food touches the heart and leaves you with a fond memory for life!!Thank you Guru Lukshmi for giving my family a great memory to cherish!!Love from NYC"}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was terrible! Kept giving us wrong food and took so long to give us food. Also we had a kid and she was hungry and we had a reservation and they said we can't sit till everyone came. Bathroom was clean and so was restaurant! Would go there again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"So I came here with my friend on Sunday night. Its insanely busy so make a reservation. They open at 5 and their phone was busy til 6 so just be prepared. If you don't make a reservation you'll be waiting an hour. So the actual dosa was amazing. I got the one that's recommended by the Toronto Star with cheese, I forget the name but its one of their most popular ones. I have a high spice tolerance and it was still a little spicy for me as a brown person. My stomach  hurt the next morning lol. So over all I would totally recommend this place for the food but the customer service is pretty bad. What we had a major issue with was that they brought my friend and I one bill. When we tried to ask them to split it or process it with two different transactions they wouldn't do it. Apparently its their policy to not give separate bills during their busy hours. Which is crazy and unheard of at any dining establishment. If you go with a big group of people one person has to pay and it can be so inconvenient afterwards. So after arguing with the manager he gave us a refund and processed it in two different transactions but its not their policy which is incredibly stupid."}
{"text":"I'm an Indian, a food hound and don't really review restaurants. This was hands down the best dosa I have had on the North American continent. Bonus points for exemplary sambhar and chutney.   Also, the service is efficient and polite. They operate like a well oiled machine. We called ahead to get a reservation. They sent a followup text message with information including our time slot and their address. We were seated as soon as we arrived. I had the Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa and my friend got the Spicy Coconut Dosa. We were famished and the dosas hit the spot. We polished them off with the filter coffee. Can't wait to go to Mississauga again just so I can get my dosa fix."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch with my family.  It was our first time having South Indian food. Had the Sambhar vada and idly for apps. Reallly good. Then we had our dosas. I got the mysore paper dosa with aloo masala. It was hugeee and I preferred the crispy texture and spicy flavour of the dosa compared to the regular dosas my family had.   Service was great. Place was clean. Decor was great. All in all will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I have been here mutliple times.  This place is fantastic.  Servies is quick, food is affordable and authentic.  All dosas are amazing, and their Sambar will definately want to make you coe back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is delicious. Well not so much the place but the food...oh ya baby! After circling the parking lot several times (and the local neighbourhood) I finally rolled up on Guru Lukshmi for the UYE dinner planned by Nicole H.  Pro-tip: Don't trust a GPS with the directions here, I did and ended up in front of someones house blocks away. When your GPS says you are within a minute or two start looking for the closest plaza and just got there.  Guru is to South Indian cuisine what The Keg Mansion is to steak - Class! This place was slammed with patrons of South Indian and Indian background alike so I knew right away this place HAD to be legit. I currently feel like the worst Yelp review writer ever because I was so blinded by hunger I asked what the most famous Dosa was of our server and ordered whatever her recommendation was without noting the name (bad..bad yelper).   My DC's who arrived before me were sharing in a Medhu Vada appetizer which essentially was deep fried Indian donuts that are served with sambar and chutney to dip. Yum!  My Dosa (which I added cheese to for an additional cost) was massive! And alos uncharacteristic of other Dosa I've eaten, as opposed to long, and rolled, my selection came folded over like an Indian Style Panzerotta (Calzone). The taste factor was a hybrid between Indian Vegetarian Cuisine and a Quesidilla. Served with a selection of chutneys I can only describe it as Delicious.  This place is non-alcoholic so don't expect to have a drink with your meal. Water is the way to go anyway! And lastly, the price? Second to none! Dosa's ranged from $8-$14 all in - For Dinner!! Ya, I'll be back!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Mini idlis and mysore masala was awesome. Will try something else from the vast menu next time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Guru Lukshmi's rave reviews are definitely accurate. The place is massive so at 12:10 pm on a Sunday we were seated within minutes. The menu is extensive, literally every variety of dosa including dessert! As a traditionalist I went for aloo masala dosa. Make sure you say crispy thin if you want it to be made that way. The dosa came with 3 chutneys and sambar. They were delicious! The potato masala was perfect with the perfect amount of spice. Next we ordered madras filter coffee for a true South Indian experience. It was good. For my son I ordered a kids dosa which was smaller and not too spicy.My little one saw the candy dosa on the kids menu so we finished off with that. It was essentially a crepe with a thin layer of chocolate topped with powdered sugar. Overall the place was very clean, lovely decor and well organized and wait staff were attentive. I loved it and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly... Not gonna lie but the food was good until the dessert came along... The dessert did not look like anything how they advertised it... The waitress description was not close and also a previous Yelp review did not look like it either. (The mango frozen yoghurt dessert) they were so stingy on the quantity that they give.  On top of that they said they don't do separate bills on weekends which is ridiculous. We asked them where it states that and the waitress pointed to a small sign in the back where half of the restaurant cannot even see it. There were two -three signs of advising customers to not bring outside food but they cannot hang a sign at the entrance stating that they don't do separate bills? We spent half an hour going to the atm machine across the plaza and paying the bill   The waitress was so rude and giving bad looks. We asked to speak to the manager regarding how inconvenient this is and how the waitress should have told us this when she saw 5 of us... Instead the waitress started blabbing some crap to the manager... Seemed like some warning for the manager to not believe what we had to say.   I wish this place could have been better and the management spent more time on their customer service skills... Than useless signs such as \"no outside food\" like obviously?!?!? We're coming to eat dosa !!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dosa/South Indian restaurants in the GTA. It's so good - I crave this food. I get hungry just even thinking about it. Seriously - come here.   Quick tips: CALL AND MAKE A RESERVATIONS ON FRI/SAT/SUN - it is mandatory.  This place is packed, you will have to wait even with a reservation if it's later on. But the food is worth it. They may rush you towards the end and rush to take your order but that's only because there are people waiting. This isn't the place to sit and chat with friends for 2 hours. It's a place to have a quick catch up and delish food!  It's so good I don't mind the wait. Just clear your evening.   If you've never tried a dosa before you're missing out- you should try it here. It's a vegetarian restaurant so you won't get meat here, but I promise it's so flavourful you will NOT even miss it.  Amazing dosa - crispy yet soft. They also have creative options for fillings (cheese, pay bhaji, tofu, spring vegetable, spicy coconut etc), tasty chutney with good quantities offered, the sambar (lentil spicy soup) was also sooooo good! Fabulous food and flavours overall. They gave good portions of the sides/chutneys, which in my opinion, is amazing.  We also tried the sambar vada which was fab. Service was good- better than the rival dosa place we all know.  Service is good. Friendly, quick, prompt. You gotta kinda know the menu and have your questions ready during busy times but everyone I've encountered is polite!"}
{"text":"Gone are the days when these guys were simple and yet focused on delivering the best South Indian food in the country. They started out from a small hole in the wall at a food court. Now, having moved out to a new place and their own restaurant in the last few years, the quality of food has become quite average. The service is pretty awful, even for an Indian restaurant. There is a significant delay in delivering the food and they even hid the burnt piece of food once on our plate and still had the audacity to serve it. I ended up there a couple of times with family and had a very irritating and unpleasant evening both times. Just wanted to smack the servers around their ears for being so stupid, unsmiling and ineffective at their job. The food could have been the saving grace but it wasn't. I am done with this piece of crap place and never going back."}
{"text":"Its more like a 6 star.  The food was fantastic.  The service was super fast.  We tried the dahi vara, mini idly, paper butter dosa, chat dosa.  They were all amazing.  I would recoment going with a group of 4 people and make reservations ahead of time other wise u might be waiting for an hour to get a table.  Compared to others the price is a premium but quality costs money.    Defiantly will be going again."}
{"text":"Excellent dosa restaurant. It is very popular so reservations are a must. The dosas are excellent as is the puri and vadas and south Indian coffee.  The service is fast and professional. My south Indian son-in-law was really impressed with this place and we've eaten at a lot of dosa places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Two words: MAKE RESERVATIONS. Few more words: DON'T ORDER YOUR DOSAS PAST 25% OF THE NORMAL SPICE.  Geez, these dosas were SO tasty!! Trust me- as a Kerala girl, I know dosas!   Atmosphere: such a beautiful interior. The lines were out the door and the place was PACKED on a Sunday afternoon. Keep in mind, they close at 3pm. Our server was fine- no issues there. So maybe they've gotten better servers based on past reviews of bad experiences...  Food: The four of us got the masala dosa, Kara dosa, coriander dosa, and set dosa. All were extremely tasty and came with condiments like sambhar, and different types of chutneys. (I liked the red on and the mint the best). These chutneys are your only hope for the fire you put on your mouth. The sambhar was bad. Not bad enough for me to knock off a star, but you've really got to make the sambhar not taste like masala straight from the box.   All together, it was around 50 ish bucks, which I believe is SUCH a great price for 4 happy, full tummies. Try it at least once!"}
{"text":"I'm a slacker, Three visits or was it four and now I sit down for this review?  5 stars handsdown. I'm no south Indian but I've been a fan of dosas and South Indian cuisine since I gave up the baby bottle. And I'll tell you this place does dosas right. Like authentic delicious crazy right! The same goes for their idlis and wadas. Always fresh always good. I especially like the mini idli appetizer pre dipped in spicy delicious sambhar.   Not necessarily a fan of the mint chutney here but the coconut and other spicy one is delish. And if you haven't yet do try the madras coffee! Love it.   So far ive tried the following dosas Mysore, Pav Bhaji, Green Chilli, Chettinad, Chilli Cheese. My favourite being the Pav Bhaji... Perfect mix of North and South!   The ambience is great restaurant is clean. The service is good as well except this time I found the usher lady a little frazzled and rude but given the crowd waiting outside and the stress.. I can't  blame her. That said im happy to hear theyre expanding.. Its always so busy and seems rushed expansion was much needed   I'm done writing the review.. But My mouth is still watering!"}
{"text":"**Don't go here without a reservation!**  The best thing I've had at Guru Lukshmi is: their trademarked dosa that was featured in the Toronto Star: Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa + cheese, extra crispy and mild sambhar cause I'm a wimp!  Every time I have been here, their reservation system worked, no mistakes with my order and everything came out quickly. You also get 1 free refill of sambhar. I agree with other reviewers that they rush you out, this isn't really a place you'd go for an intimate dinner with long conversations. I'm totally fine with eating and running here cause the dosa is that good!"}
{"text":"The food is extraordinary, the service less than. Pav bhaji dosa is the best pick if you have a high spice tolerance. The sweet lassi is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"We had a great time! It's just that you have to reserve your table in advance otherwise you have to wait. Since I read this thing on Yelp so we reserved our table and skipped the waiting queue. We ordered Idli, Vada, Mysore Dosa(Gurulukshami's famous), Rava Masala Dosa, Filter Coffee and Uttapam, Paan for take away... and everything was yummy... till now the best South Indian food in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Thre was a 40 minute waiting time on a weekend.  But it builds up your motivation to enjoy the fantastic variety of South Indian cuisine.  The dosas are the best I have had compared to back in Mumbai!  It was jam packed but yet the service is swift and precise.  It s clean and good ambience too."}
{"text":"Alright, so my roots are north Indian but let me tell you about how south Indian people do it up. My friend lives near by and he has always told me about this place and I would always see serious line ups out the door, into the parking lot. I just had to go here. I came mid day, at the end of lunch, so I barely made it in time before they close for the dinner rush. This place is decorated fairly pish-posh and the size of the booth that we were sitting at was huge. I was so hungry that I didn't care to make small talk and stuck my head into the menu to see what is good. Everything looked good. We decided to start off with an appetizer, dahi vada. It is something I get every time I go to an Indian restaurant. Since they were in a hurry to wrap things up, they kindly asked if we could order our mains aswell. My friend told me to grab the one which was mentioned in the Toronto Star, so I ordered the Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa and my friend ordered the Mushroom Dosa with cheese. The service was pretty fast. I got the dahi vada and it was off the hook. The lentil doughnuts were perfectly submerged into the yogurt with a nice kick of sweet and tangy tamarind sauce... mmm. Within 5 minutes of us completing the appetizer we got our dosas. My dosa looked really appetizing. Best way to describe it, is a light crepe folded over with a generous filling of potato, red and green peppers, fresh onions and special spices. To be honest, once I started to eat, I didn't ask my friend how his dosa was because I was busy enjoying mine. There was less talking and more eating, which means the food was delicious. I loved all the chutneys and curries which made dosa eating so much fun. It is ok to get a little messy with your hands, thats how you enjoy south Indian cooking. I will totally come back to try other things on the menu. So glad I got to eat here. I also favour this dosa place over most places."}
{"text":"Wow, can I say wow again. The food is beyond delicious. I can say the best Dosa I have eaten in Toronto. I am from South India, and my brother said it's the best, as he has eaten some back home. So definitely worth the drive from the east end.  The service is impeccable, they actually care about their guests. They are friendly and very attentive. The owners I have met are extremely nice and do all the cooking themselves. I do want to point out though, they are extremely busy. So you do need to make a reservation. But I think that's expected to get this good quality food.  So if ur on the fence, just GO!"}
{"text":"Best place for South Indian food I have experienced till date anywhere in the world.  I haven't seen the menu they have anywhere else.  Though they can improve their services and train their servers to be more hospitable."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much. After reading reviews I was so excited   Ugh so not a fan....   I ordered the spinach dosa, and for an appetizer we got soup and pakoras   I order pakoras all the time but since when is a deep fried chilli pepper a pakora ????   The soup was not for me at all, I hated it. I had two bites and could not eat anymore   The dosa was good but nothing amazing and not hot all all, I wanted to ask for it warmed up but my server never came back   Which is my next issue. Service was ssoooooo bad, food came quick but they never came to check up on us I had to call over a serve to ask for a take out container and then call a server to ask for the bill and then call a server to get my change.   They weren't even busy.... the servers just didn't pay attention at all :/   idk guys, I think this place is super over rated. I didn't like my food and my server(s) sucked...   42$ for 2 dosas , pakoras & a soup ....."}
{"text":"Love this place - especially the spicy coconut dosa... It's a must try! The customer service is also very good."}
{"text":"The best dosa place in the GTA.  I had the chaat dosa. The flavours painted a rainbow in my mouth; I saw a vision of angels and I heard the most beautiful music in my mind as I ate my meal. The dessert, ras malai, was absolutely perfect as well. I only wish I had room for some more food."}
{"text":"Interesting twist on dosas - loads of varieties! Waiting area is a bit cramped but overall quick service and no complaints. I love dosas and went for a TM dosa and was satisfied though I will have to go back and try more to give a real opinion on their traditional varieties."}
{"text":"One of the best south Indian place to go to. The vast variety of Dosas is amazing, ranging from mild to extremely spicy. All the ones I have tried so far are very tasty."}
{"text":"Just fantastic food here, tastebuds were on cloud nine! Well, I am a South Indian and can vouch for the authenticity of the taste and food .   I will recommend you to visit this place with family, friends , as couples or with kids.   Service -5*  Food-5* Ambience-5*  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Newbie to dosas, but per my Indian foodie friend, this place is really tasty - the spice level is waaaay up there if that is what you want. I've never seen her so happy! I, like one of those old cartoons, steam came out of my ears and I lost a bit of my hearing with my 2 jalepeno rating of spicy coconut dosa.   Place has a big menu and is broken down into different categories. Trendy setting, busy, but fast service.  If you're new to the heat, order a lassi and aim no more than 25% (1 chili pepper), but if you're expert level this place will satisfy you to no end. The standard sambhar can also be slightly toned down, but if you're here, you probably know what you came in for. And like any incredible food place, you'll walk out smelling like it too."}
{"text":"I should have added a review much earlier when I had gone to Toronto.  We tried their dosa and rava kesari, both dishes were awesome.  They offer best south Indian food experience.   Well done and keep it up!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favourite dosa restaurant! We went to Guru Lakshmi yesterday and really enjoyed our service, food, and of course the atmosphere. We arrived at 7:50 for our 8 o'clock reservation and were seated as soon as the table was ready. Although the restaurant was extremely busy, our server made it a point to attend to us right away. Our food also Came very fast, approximately within 15 minutes. Both my husband and I ordered the masala dosa and we finished off our dinner with Masala chai and kulfi. Overall this is truly the best dosa we have had within the GTA Region, I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a shot!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best dosa place I've had in GTA! The menu boasts a variety of creative spin on Indian classics such as Pav Bhaji dosa and spicy coconut dosa. I love that you can customize each dosa to suit your preferred level of spice and oil The dosas come with coconut and mint/yogurt dips along with rasam. The place is hard to find seating so reservations are recommended (via email is best - they are very prompt!).   The service is professional and servers are polite. Food arrived quickly and was fresh. There is ample seating but it's always full. Will definitely pay another visit.  Recco: Spicy coconut dosa, Mysore dosa, pav bhaji dosa, filter coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent Southern Indian food!  There is not much I can add that hadn't been said already.  Very good dosas and a wide selection....traditional as well as creative varieties.  The sambar and chutneys that came with dosas are so fresh and tasty, they must be house-made on the same day.    The place is clean and tastefully decorated.  Pretty good service despite being very busy.  The only tip I'd give if you've never been to this place is....do NOT, do NOT follow the GPS.  Guru is located in Derry Village strip mall which is on the north side of Derry road between McLaughlin and Saint Barbara."}
{"text":"Over the years this place has become more busy and also the food I believe has gone down in taste. Though great dosas and sambhar."}
{"text":"This place thrives on its arrogance with regard to food. Obnoxious customer service. They even charge for extra chutney. The only reason why people throng here is because of their cuisine, and they treat their customers like people to be rid off. I would only eat here if I was starving and had nowhere else to go."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place has some insanely delicious food.  I came for Nicole H's UYE. Luckily, we both showed up early and treated ourselves to an appetizer: Medhu Vada, which was light, crispy and incredibly addictive. They're basically deep fried donuts that you dip in sambar, chutney and some other sauce that was tasty.   I ordered one of the specialty dosas, the Chettinad Masala Dosa with aloo masala. It had three chili's beside it. There was quite a bit of heat, which was making my face sweat the entire time we were eating. After that, it felt like I swallowed whole coals for a couple of hours. That'll keep you warm all winter! It was absolutely delicious, the dosa was crisp and light, and it was all vegan, which simplifies things for my dairyfreeness.   It was absolutely delicious, but it's about a half hour drive out of Toronto. It's definitely a destination to go to the next time I'm in Mississauga.  Oh and atmosphere was fine, lots of families with babies. Service was insanely quick and friendly.  You can steal free WIFI from the Wild Wing next door if you're so inclined."}
{"text":"The best place For dosa. The wait is SO LONG but it's ok because you can get hungrier while you wait and the food will taste even more delicious. The dosa are always huge I can never finish one have to take it home (not a good idea as it gets soggy try your best to finish at the restaurant). The service is amazing, servers constantly asking if everything is alright and making sure everyone knows the heat level for the dosas they choose.  Great place must check it out!"}
{"text":"Best dosa around! Lots of flavour  Food doesn't taste too oily and heavy like most other dosa places  Lots of flavour and dosa options to choose from Place is always busy. Make a reservation"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was! My boyfriend and I ordered the mysore dosa and onion rava dosa both with aloo (potatoes). I was really impressed with the variety of dosas available. We also got mango lassis! The waiter was also very nice and we didn't have an issue with the service. I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Don't go on Sunday. Food was meh. Staff was totally confused. Scurrying to avoid falling over each other. Amateurish and kinda haughty/ scornful. How the mighty have fallen? Mr. Luxshmi. Why?"}
{"text":"Always busy, which is a good indicator of popularity. Rushed service, food quality is decent. The dosa is perfectly done and prices are reasonable. Menu is extensive due to different slight variations...not too easily understand for newcomers. Felt the need to study up prior to dinning due to rushed service (couldn't really get the servers to explain much)..."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food. Start with mini idlies and Dahi vada, followed by their amazing dosas. My fav is aaloo chat dosa and rawa dosa. I love their butter milk and coffee.  Make a reservation so that you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"All veggie. Delicious wish there was meat options. Yes I get it's a vegetarian restaurant"}
{"text":"The dosa's were excellent and very spicey. If you like spicey food this is the place to go! Very good customer service."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  This place is hella overrated. The service is garbage. We called and emailed to make a reservation and were told that we have to be there in person to put our names down. When we got there they said they were full reserved till 10pm.  When we tried to speak to the manager the concierge started yelling and swearing. Seriously this place needs to be reported.   The worst thing about this place is that all your clothes smell like curry."}
{"text":"Whenever I have guests from outside GTA, I take them to Gurulukshmi.  Food taste is really authentic Indian. Very good to excellent."}
{"text":"My sister and I were really craving Indian food and we found Guru Lukshmi on Yelp with raving reviews. Without hesitating, we drove our way over. Our big mistake was not calling ahead for a reservation, we thought we would wait, but the next available table was in an hour and a half. This place was packed! Note to self: call ahead of time.   Good: Since we couldn't get a table, we decided to get take out. The menu was unfamiliar to me, as I didn't really recognize any mainstream Indian dishes on it. I asked the girl at the counter and she recommended the popular dosas and vadas. Best decision ever. The food had such rich flavors and the sauces were perfectly paired together and the dosas were perfectly crispy, I really enjoyed the food.  Bad: Make a reservation. Don't walk in.  Bottom line: I'll definitely go back again if I'm in the area when I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Awesome and perfect as always. The crowd it pulls says it all. South Indian food at its best. Authentic and fresh dishes. Service is also above average despite the volume of customers they deal with daily."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying kudos to Guru Lakshami for properly combining authenticity and innovation in their restaurant. I rarely come across a restaurant owner who does not care about making money but cares for his food quality and his customers.  Two things done right here: Vegetarian and South Indian. The owner who also happens to be the chef has kept the beautiful Indian traditions alive and I respect that a lot. I have come across enough fake Indian restaurants who have murdered the beautiful cuisine.  I was a walk in and was lucky to get a table. Ordered Methu Vada and Mirchi pakora at first. Sambhar done really well, Vada's crispy on the outside and soft inside. Chutney's all made by hand were delicious. Mirchi Pakora done very nice with chilli not being too hot but also telling me that \"hey! I am a chilli I will be hot\". Ordered the Pav Bhaji Dosa and I am in love. It was by far one of the best innovative dosa's I have had.  To the people here leaving negative comments. You are all idiots and clearly have no idea about authenticity, because you have been eating fake Indian food all your life and simply cannot appreciate quality. Make a bloody reservation!!! How loud do they have to say that to you? They just offered me a business card just for reservations. Let me put it in a simple manner which you will understand \"GOOD FOOD\", \"MAKE RESERVATION\", \"WILL BE BUSY\".  Also to top all this off all the food I had was recommended by the server and I talk to 3 servers and they all knew the food and restaurant by heart."}
{"text":"I'm South Indian and I have to say this is one of the best South Indian (Tamil) restaurants in the GTA. Very delicious food."}
{"text":"My first time having Dosa's. My only disappointment is that this place isn't closer to my house.  However it was definately worth the drive. I suggest if you have the time to make it out to that end of town for some quality indian dosa's.  There is a great selection of spicy/non-spicy , veggie/meaty dosa's, along with many desserts and appetizers.  I had the breaded and fried peppers as an appetizers and the matar paneer dosa as my main dish.  Very tasty, fresh, and quickly prepared.    Also had one of those special indian coffees for dessert.  The bill was 20$ including tip. So much quality food for so cheap. It blows me away!!"}
{"text":"My fav dosa place! Please make reservations before going.... You may still have to wait some times but it's all worth it! My fav is the rasavada for starters, spicy coconut dosa, mango lassi is the best here and of course no southindian meal is complete without the coffee."}
{"text":"It's gone down one star and let me tell you why.   1. I wanted to order a uthapam , wanted to replace the mozzarella cheese with paneer (Indian cottage cheese), the server said no, after literally arguing with him for 5 minutes, he said it will be $4 extra.   Not for something extra, just a replacement. He could have said it in the beginning, I would have gladly paid for it.   Service had gone down a lot.   2. They charge you for extra chutney which is not very common in south Indian restaurants. Even after charging. 50 cents the portion of chutney we got was ridiculous. It was may be one tablespoon.   Will go there again but if the service remains the same then I might just stop."}
{"text":"Well I must say I like the food here but have received the worst customer service ever. The young guys think they are too smart and misbehave with everyone. The manager tries to calm things down but by then its too late. These guys need to tone down in front of the customers.  My 1st time was a walk in and we waited for 2 hrs just for the food. We waited beyond the reserved time just to witness all the chaos taking place. After that also when we were sent inside to be seated there was still a lot of confusion. Those young guys are clueless about everything.  My second time I was told to email and reserve the place and I did that. Even after that I had to wait for 30 mins. I would suggest get rid of the staff and you wud do just fine."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit here. Came right at 5 when they opened for dinner and there was already a line of people outside waiting to enter.   Menu is all vegetarian which is awesome and there's an excellent choice!  I ordered Paneer a Cheese Dosa which tasted great. Also enjoyed the chutneys and sambar.  Got Madras Filter Coffee as well which was .  Finished off with rasmalai which was two pieces for $4.50.   Service was very very quick and lots of waiters around to take your order.   I look forward to coming back and trying something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you love dosas, then look no further! Great taste and awesome service. Simran took our order and she was very friendly especially given we were party of 8 and sometimes it can be chaotic in deciding your choice! To couple the menu has so many choices! She was patient and kept checking on us. The place seem to be new and well kept! Also they have implemented technology well to take orders. But to enjoy the good food and the service please call ahead and make reservation! This place is BUSY! We tried two days in a row to get in! Be ready to wait when you arrive, despite reservation, but the wait is worth."}
{"text":"What's the hyper all about??Just regular tasting dosas to me.  So obviously I made a reservation to eat there on a weeknight since this place is always fully packed. All went smooth with the reservation got seated on time and order was taken quick.  The food came out fairly fast and tasted really like any other dosa place there wasn't anything exceptional amazing about the taste and flavor.Generally dosas are made fresh to order and the filling and chutnies were pretty standard.  The only thing special about this place is their long list of different dosas.For me I like to stick with the basics.Rava and Mysore are my favs.  Once the food was out the server obviously forgot about us since this place is fully packed even on the weeknight.  The tables are so closely placed that there is no concept of privacy you can actually hear the conversation going on at the tables right and left of you.I actually felt like gobbling down all my food and leaving the place ASAP.  No ambience what so ever.  There is plenty of parking outside and the pricing is fair."}
{"text":"Four star food, five star hospitality and willingness to accommodate a large and admittedly boisterous group.  We first made a reservation for 10... then moved it to 15... then finally to 22. When we showed up, they quickly showed us where our group would be sitting. Our group took a long time to arrive, and an even longer time to stop talking/yelling and sit down (Indian reunions are chaotic!), and while the restaurant did ask us very politely a few times to sit down so we could order, they were not at all pushy or rude. That hospitality earned major points in my book because they would have been pretty justified in being pushier.  Their menu is interesting given they market themselves as authentic - there's not much authentic about a pav bhaji dosa - but it's quite comprehensive, covering tiffin items, uthapam, and tons of varieties of dosas. Given our big group, we ended up ordering a ton of different items and sharing. I'm honestly not sure of everything we ordered, but standouts for me were the paneer spring vegetable dosa, dahi idlis (salty), mysore masala dosa, and mysore bhaji masala dosa... and of course their awesome, delicious, 100% South Indian approved filter coffee!  We drove by the next day at about ~8PM and it looked like there was a huge line outside, so it definitely seems advisable to go early or get a reservation.  Thank you Guru Lukshmi for hosting a very happy family reunion!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is way to hyped. It is always really busy so they are rushing you to get in and out. It feels like you are in a fast food restaurant because I was only there for 1 hour. If the food was good I might've overlooked the service but the food is not good at all. The sambar had no taste and the breading for the dosa felt like it was stale. I really don't know how why this place is so busy it really is not good. I suggest if you are looking for a good dosa go to dosa paradise. Please take my advice and don't come here!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Masala Dosa's in the GTA.  Face it, our options in the city for great south indian food is limited, but this place beats all them others outta the ball park!  I had the Kaara Dosa..and be warned of that one! I had it only half chili, and my face was steaming with pure joy and torture and love and hate and tears and laughter and magic.  It was awesome.  For pic, check out my photos!"}
{"text":"The dosas were very good, not oily but crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. The sambar and chutneys they came with were very delicious and flavorful. I got the spicy paper dosa and it was really good. I actually finished it because of how thin and not soggy it was.   Writing this review and I want to go back already.   The service was really good, the servers checked in on us just the right amount. He also made recommendations when we were deciding between two different dosas. He made sure to check for spice levels.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and a change of scenery from normal dosa places I go to. i would even go as far to say it could be a date spot.   I'm definitely going to go back and try it again. Make sure to make reservations as they are always packed."}
{"text":"Ambience & Decor: Ethnic with a modern twist.  High ceilings & sectioned seating plan.  Service: Service is very efficient & good, the staff are welcoming.  Food: Fabulous, one of a kind dosas. Delicious chutneys, Jain food, lassi, coffee, tea, desserts. Good atmosphere, nice decor. Worth the long drive to Mississauga just to go to Guru Lakshmi. Good for family & group. The menu is extensive and very interesting - definitely worth the revisits. They keep adding to their menu - they are adding millet dosas (ragi) which are very healthy & good for diabetic people."}
{"text":"Yummy Dosa's. Our favorite spot for Dosas. I had the chilli & cheese dosa, was absolutely fantastic.   Definitely recommend making reservations as the place is very busy and the wait can be tedious. I am not a fan of the waiting area. Its small and does not cater tor their crowds."}
{"text":"Wow, Where to start? This place is amazing and the amount of people here is no joke. I couldn't believe how many people are waiting for this place; People wait because the food is phenomenal. Best dosas I have ever eaten. Period.  We came here on a Sunday evening, made a reservation of four for 7:30pm and I couldn't believe there was a waiting room for people who reserved..let alone another one for those without a reservation. If you want to eat here, reserve. You don't want to wait hours to get a table right? We went in at 7:45pm.  We started off with dahi idly which are rice/lentil cakes in a sweet yoghurt based sauce with boondi. I have not been a huge fan of idly in general so these were just alright. The chili bajji pakora was really disappointing. You can make these at home with chick pea batter. They were nothing special, and tasted bland. I also recommend getting the lassi (yoghurt drink) which is the perfect compliment, and stick with the mango. The creamy sweetness coat your tastes buds perfectly after all those spices. And stay far away from the ginger which tasted like spoiled milk. It was ridiculously sour!   Okay so now for the entrees: we ordered the pav bhaji dosas, the traditional paper dosa with aloo masala, cheese dosa, paneer dosa, onion and tomato uthapam, and pineapple and cheese uthapam (yeah, we ordered too much for four people - stick with one per person). They all came with the delicious tomato/mint/coconut chunteys and sambar. I was just smothering them on like no tomorrow. I have never tried these special dosas before and can say they're great. We added cheese to most of them and they were pretty hefty. These are dosas with substance, they have a lot going on in them. Like the signature dosas had vegetables in them. I would probably suggest to not order them with cheese, the dosas were quite heavy as a result. I still enjoyed my paper dosa the most though. It was crispy and I just like my potatoes lightly seasoned. Please note the uthapam takes 45 minutes to arrive. It was also my first time and it's really tasted like pizza (in a good way!), try it and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great selection of dosas from traditional masala dosas to exotic specialties.  Strongly recommend a reservation as we went on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately as a result of having one, otherwise expect a long wait. Great service as well and a varied kids menu."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place! I've been twice, now. Both times, I've been wowed.  I was here a few days ago with my boyfriend, and we ordered some appetizers. We got the idly/vada combo and the chappathi with potato bhaji. The food came out promptly. Still hot, full of flavour, and absolutely delicious.  I ordered the Chaat Dosa with aloo masala, and my boyfriend got the Pav Bhaji Dosa with cheese. Again, the food was out within minutes.   Portions are pretty large. Perfectly warm and delicious. You can order less oil, or no oil, which is nice if you want to be a little healthier. The servers are helpful and pleasant. They can answer your questions, and attend to you promptly.  My only complaint is: last time we came here, we had a reservation, but still ended up waiting about 20 minutes for a table. We also had a reservation when we went the other day, but got seated immediately. I guess it just depends on how busy they are. But note that the food came out quickly both times - when it was super busy and average.  Definitely make a reservation if you want to come here at traditionally busy times (especially on weekends)!   Can't wait to come back another time! :)"}
{"text":"This is my millionth time I have come here. Needless to say the food is amazing. What I loved this time was how accessible this place is for wheelchair customrrs plus how welcome  they make you feel. They cared about not only our comfort but made sure my sister who is in wherlchair did not feel uncomfortable. Love ypu guys!"}
{"text":"Let me be super clear about this. The service here stinks. But the foooooooood is oh so gooooooood. This is my fave dosa place, hands down.  I have been here a bunch of times with my bae and his family and we have always enjoyed our meal. The service is rushed, forgetful, and slightly rude. You may experience a situation where half of the table has their meals and have don't. But I believe this is all part of the authentic Guru Lukshmi experience.   All that aside, the dosas are on point y'all. My personal fave is the spring roll dosa, made medium spicy. It's stuffed with fresh veggies and comes with amazing sauces to dip in. OMG this is YUM! For my meat eating peeps, this place is strictly veggie, but you should still try it!   MAKE RESERVATIONS. If you don't you will wind up waiting outside of the restaurant with approximately 50 other peeps. Not joking."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how busy this was on a Monday night - line up outside the door! We had a reservation so didn't take us long to get seated (though we had to wait until most of our group arrived).   I ordered the crispy dosa with potato masala, and shared an idli appetizer.  The food was great, I especially liked the idli (very soft and doughy) - not sure how it's supposed to taste as this was my first time trying this.  The mint/coconut/sambhar sauces were all very distinct, moreso than at other places I've tried. The sambhar was delicious but there were some whole spices at the bottom that I drank that left a very bitter taste in my mouth. I haven't had this happen before - not sure why this spice isn't completely crushed up, or strained and removed.  NOTE: If you need separate bills, announce that at the time of ordering. The server said he could not provide separate bills at the end, only split the bill equally."}
{"text":"My family of 6 and I went for lunch here on a busy Sunday. We made a reservation but it did take a while to seat us. So do make a reservation before you go or expect to be waiting awhile because this place is very busy.   When we did get seated food and service was great! Everything was fresh and came out fast! Their staff work hard and very well. They did their absolute best to get you what you wanted quickly and I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Very very good dosa. What sets this place apart is the variety offered - interesting flavors of dosa, uttapam, idli, etc.  Service is meh, but unimportant. If you make a reservation, you will likely still wait 15 minutes, so just prepare for it. They are very busy, so you may feel rushed to order, eat, and leave. Just think of the poor souls waiting outside for 2 hours to get a table, and try to oblige within reason"}
{"text":"Guru was the first place I ever had dosa, so basically they are responsible for my addiction. I have tried Dosa at a couple of other places, one of which I believe is the same owners (and this is the only one that compares to Guru), but Guru is and likely always will be the BEST. Their Dosa's come out crispy and somehow manage to stay that way throughout. The worst is a soggy Dosa and you won't find that here. Their chutneys are amazing, I love coconut chutney and they have a green one that taste like fresh cilatro, beware the red tomato chutney! It's super hot!  I love that they have so many different choices of Dosa's, I personally get the spicy coconut, it is fantastic, it is so flavorful, highly recommend. The plain mango juice isn't very good, that's my go to drink at Indian restaurants but this seemed thin consistency and out of a can. Much prefer puree based juices. Do try their masala tea however, especially in the cooler months! They get very very busy here after 7:00pm so if you're planning on going later they often have people sitting outside waiting to get in. If you can I suggest coming around 5:30 when it's much quieter."}
{"text":"We got 4 dosas and two orders of samosas and it was an enormous amount of food!  Everything was extremely flavorful, we tried the buttered dosa, chaat dosa, and paneer dosa! They all had aloo masala (made from potatoes) in between the dosas, and came with various chutneys. The mango lassi was also delicious, went well with the dosas! Btw, one spice level is not spicy at all in my opinion, a stronger kick would have even tastier!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to find a variety of creative flavors in dosa. The ambiance was very nice, compared to many other south-indian restaurants its a family oriented restaurant . The service was okay/mediocre  for our wait time, ordered a Masala Dosa ( which is just a dosa filled with potatoes but soaked in with rich falvours& spices). The Sambhar and chutney flavours was an exquiste pairing. Overall i can't wait to go visit Guru Lukshmi again."}
{"text":"My first time eating southern Indiana food, and I was blown away. Will totally come back!"}
{"text":"Good dosa. Tons of options, the menu is huge. Good for people who can't handle spice because they ask you what level of spiciness you want. Food is fantastic, service coulod have been better. Would be back."}
{"text":"The best dosa spot!  But on top of that, the absolute best family run business!   So before I review the food and place, let me start by saying that my family has been Guru Lukhsmi customers for over 10+ years. Originally, this couple had a small shop on Dundas (basement style) surrounded by commercial shops. You would get your food, and bring it out and eat at the 4-5 seats they had setup. Forward a few years, they moved to an Erin Mills location with a proper sit down area and they started to get bigger. The lines started to get longer, but the business was still family run and cooked- and food never changed a taste.   Forward another few years, and now you have this good size restaurant in the heart of Derry Plaza, which easily runs an hour long wait on evenings and gathers large crowds of People during the toasty summer nights.   Well, let me tell you- the restaurant is STILL family run, in house cooked, and still phenomenal.  It is well worth the 45 minute wait, however you can make reservations now so you could skip that crowd if you plan ahead.   What to eat: if you haven't tried it yet, the pao Bhaji dosa is a must. It's extremely heavy and can be shared among 2 people. But it is delicious. Also love the Mysore masala dosa, which is your regular potato stuffed dosa with spices.  My parents love their idlis as an appetizer,which they say are extremely soft and they cannot get that texture when making it at home.  They do have some serious quirky takes on dosa as well, and I've had the opportunity to try the paneer dosa, but I love the authentics.   Restaurant: started from the bottom now they here! Literally, they have come a long way and now the restaurant has a beautiful well setup seating area sizzling with South Indian aromas and warmth from the moment you step in.   If you haven't been yet, go check it out as you won't get this good food unless you find yourself in the South of India :)"}
{"text":"I had been told that Guru Lukshmi makes THE BEST dosa in town.  True?  Mmmm... I'm  not so sure.  It is darn good though!  And the service was friendly and efficient.  I really can't complain.  But being a dosa devotee, I can't honestly say it's THE BEST in the area. But good. Quite good."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience.  The restaurant itself is very busy and it's best to make a reservation.  Very crowded inside but very beautiful. Very clean.  The food was amazing. It was very aromatic with complex and rich flavours. We loved the chilli Bali, the Medhu Vada, the sandwich Uthapam with cheese was amazing and the cheese dosa. We also tried the Jeera Lassi for the first time and it was amazing. The service was excellent. Very polite and attentive. Always smiling."}
{"text":"Still as good as I first reviewed them almost an year ago. We went again with reservations and had to wait 10 mins to get in. (Without reservations wait for dinner was 90 minutes!)  I tried the tofu vegetable dosa this time and had their perfect madras filter coffee again! It was delicious. The coffee was so good that I had to get a second cup! Don't really expect a quiet atmosphere or friendly service. But do go in expecting great food in a clean environment. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great service, really really busy, lots of families and not private at all  3 of 5 on date  Great for mature crowd"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for a dinner as recommended by many of my Mississauga friends. I'm extremely excited with the excellent results. GL is a nostalgia-inducing family run South Indian restaurant.   What was a gem I thought I discovered is actually a classic community restaurant. It's packed during the dinner service. Be prepared to wait a while because I don't believe they take reservations. This restaurant felt like my favorite dosa chain in South India, through service and hospitality.   This location is tiny for the amount of customers they receive but they are moving soon to a larger location. On this visit we tried the bonda ($5, two small deep fried flour balls stuffed with spiced potatoes and served with coconut chutney). It was okay as I have had better. It seemed to be the same spiced potatoes they used in dosas and a little creativity would have served them better.   We also had the green chili masala dosa, spicy garlic masala dosa, and the ghee masala dosa(all $8-10 each). They were all excellently made and the dosas actually consisted of fresh chilies, garlic, and ghee, respectively. The chutneys and sambar were strong, flavorful, and very peppery as a nice change to the stale status quo of uninspired dosa restaurants in the GTA. They only accept cash or debit.  I have to say that GL blows Mississauga's Dosa Palace (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/dosa-palace-mississauga#hrid:89gf0evlForvGRDgrs-5tw/src:self) out of the water."}
{"text":"Came here on a friends recommendation. Were told by the host it would be a few minutes wait for a table. Waited in the cold waiting area for 15 minutes before the host came out to put our name on the list and told us it would be a 45 minute wait. Really bad first impression. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Good to great Dosa S , South Indian innovation starts here . My family loved the spiced dosa .xxxxtreme !"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Unfortunately, the ambience is not authentic South Indian, with Hindi songs playing in the background and mirrored walls which look kinda strange. You usually need to make reservations here or suffer the long queues. Also, you need to pack a set of ear plugs to drown out the din. However, I must say, the dosas are amazing. The sambhar is also served fresh and is pretty spicy, which I really like. The orders are delivered fast too. I've been here 4-5 times and the food has been consistently great. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The worst service in the world. They make you wait over half an hour for your reservation yet kick you out soon as you finish eating. Not to mention how rude the service staff and hosts are on a consistent basis.  Better yet, you call and they say they have a table for 5 available, you call two minutes later to reserve and they tell you they \"don't take any reservations, ok bye\". You tell them to hold on, remind them that you just called, response is \"yah, bye\" and they hang up on you. Dimwitted, rude, crap staff that don't deserve your money!"}
{"text":"Further evidence if you want good Indian food, look directly under the take off/landing paths near major airports. Guru Lukshmi, nestled around signs warning the whole area is nearly unlivable due to airliner noise, keeps up that fine tradition."}
{"text":"Best dosas in GTA! You know the food is good when the parking lot is full of people waitin to get in. Clean and modern atmosphere. Place is small but the flavor is big. Will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I don't eat South Indian cuisine all that often, but if I did, I'd probably always be at this dosa place. Portions are big, dosas are the good kind of crispy. I'd highly recommend trying the Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa. Got lots of kick to it. Restaurant was busy, but service was quick. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I visited this place at least 3 years ago. It was a weekend and we drove there from Kitchener for lunch. Even back then this place was totally full. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated.   For starters we tried medu vadas and idlis and they were excellent! One of my friend's ordered their \"extremely spicy\" Kaara Masala Dosa. I ordered the Onion Rava Masala Dosa. The food was pretty good. The service was a bit lacking though. Well, after all it was a weekend and the place was packed as hell. The chutneys at this place were amazing. The sambhar was so-so.   This place definitely has some authentic food. My friend (with the spicy dosa) was like \"Oh this is not so spicy\" but you could tell that he was sweating and having trouble eating it. I tried a bite and it was definitely out of my spice tolerance range! Be sure to make reservations if you are visiting."}
{"text":"This place is known for its variety of dosas and there is no surprise that they are probably one of the best in this region. However, there is so much demand out there and a crazy waiting line on weekends that the place has lost its original charm. You go to a restaurant to unwind, chat up with friends and have a good meal but a dinner or lunch at this place kills it. It becomes extremely frustrating. Even if you have a reservation they make you wait - some of the folks waiting are senior citizens. There is always a rush, urgency from the staff when they interact with you  -  please decide on what you want to eat and give the order as soon as possible. I think they even secretly wish that we chew our food faster and get out of there as soon as possible. The food here is good with lots of options : different spice levels and crust levels but the demand and the crazy wait times are resulting in deteriorating quality. A tip: if you are traveling with kids or a  in group, please avoid this place. It's a bloody zoo out there! My overall ra4 stars on food but only 1 star on ambience and service making it a net of 2 stars. I was told by the management that they are expanding - they have bought the nearby Shawarma store. I am hoping that it regains its lost glory."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim as I was craving some vadas and dosas. It is definitely worth going here. Their atmosphere and food are just the perfect pairing!  Even though the line was out the door, we were seated immediately as it only two people. The service is very quick and very good.  I got the 1 idli/2 vada plate as well as Mysore bhaji masala dosa. It was perfect! The sambar was the best I have tried (other than my mom's).   I would definitely recommend this place but would STRONGLY suggest to make reservations."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! My co-workers and I frequent this location quite often for their Signature Dosas! My regular is the Paneer Dosa and it has always been fantastic! Light and crispy and they do not cheap out on the filling! Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"The dosas here were really good. I tried the cheese dosa.  I really like all the condiments that came with the dosa.  The atmosphere was nice as well. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The best dosa place in Toronto. I prefer the spinach dosa. Service is super fast. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Enjoy all the Dosas at this place. I love the kesari too. If you like filtered coffee make sure you specify how dark and how hot ."}
{"text":"Amazing place.. i am so happy with all the dishes we ordered.. the filter copy was amazing !!"}
{"text":"I tried the Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa on my first visit and I loved it! I'd ask for it to be cooked with less oil next time, but the flavours were great."}
{"text":"This place has been shipped right from India. One of the best dosa places in Toronto region and worth a visit. Several items on the menu, professional servers and quick service.  We had dosas, uthappam, idli, spring dosas and mendu vada served hot and quick. The place is packed and if you are going with a group of 3 or more, call in advance for reservation.  Do not spend money on madras filter coffee. It's milk with nescafe powder. Will I come back to this place, definitely.."}
{"text":"Mysore Bhaji Aloo Masala Dosa - is a mild Mysore paste spread on dosa, topped with a perfect combination of fresh onions, coriander, green and red peppers, special spices and butter to give it a pleasantly surprising taste.   Idly (Steamed rice and cake)and Vada (fried lentil flour doughnut) combination - served with coconut, tomato chutneys and sambhar.   Spicy Rastan soup - home made spicy and tangy soup made with lentil, tomato, and tamarind juice flavoured with red chillies, pepper and spices.  All of the above were absolutely incredible.   Go eat here!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a dosa before. Okay - I lied, I've had a dosa, but never an authentic one.  It was 9:30 PM on a Saturday night, and there was STILL a line-up!  This is when you know it's going to be a good place.  My friend recommended this place to us and she really pushed for it.  Service was great - they were very friendly with us, but it was funny because the waiter made us order different things.  Truth be told, I had no idea what I was really eating, but it was delicious.  Not only that, I got to eat with my hands for the first time.  I was not as elegant as those who have eaten there before.  LOVED the place.  If only I came to Mississauga a bit more often."}
{"text":"My 2 nd visit and still get over the authentic taste of the dosas and the uttampam!Its  a very busy place so be prepared for a wait but it's worth the wait, especially if you love spicy.Had the Kara Dosa with 100% spice level and they go up to 150% and it was amazing . The heat did not overpower but you can still feel the bite.The Chutneys were well prepared and one good thing about this place is that the taste is consistent . The service was outstanding a shout out to Aakash and Rudra and all who attended us.The only drawback is that they have no wifi  so visitors  who don't have access  to wifi it becomes a little cumbersome . I had to ask them for access code so I can order my Uber ride back to the Hotel! Apparently it's only for their use . Anyways one of the employee was kind enough to share their Hotspot Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Guru Lukshmi for over 8 years now and the food is amazing every time. The rasam is nice and spicy and really warms you up when its freezing outside. I got their mysore bhaji and paneer dosa when I went. The mysore was nicely seasoned and flavored, and was very crispy. I recommend getting the bhaji on the side to prevent the dosa from getting soggy. The paneer in the paneer dosa was very well seasoned, but the dosa itself got very soggy because of all the paneer. I go to Guru Lukshmi every time I visit Toronto and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I've known this place since they first had a little strip joint in a mall on Hurontario and Dundas... and let's just say, I knew they'd make it big. I love what they have done with the place and how they have marketed simple South Indian cuisine - especially Dosas. They serve every kind - spicy, non-spicy, heavy, light, something for everyone.  Ankie Tips?   1. If this is your first time, try a Butter Paper Dosa (without masala). It's a huge Indian crepe, crispy and yum and comes with a variety of chutneys.   2. If you don't eat spicy, try the same and ask to replace all the chutneys with the non-spicy coconut chutney. I usually do two coconut chutneys and one coriander... to mix it up a little.   3. If you like spicy, go crazy. You have tons of options! Don't underestimate the levels of spice though. My mom loves spicy food and she usually can't go beyond level 2 spice at Guru Lukshmi.  Anyway, this is one of the best dosa places, hands down. However, they have thickened the formula of their chutneys recently, and I am not too happy about that. Also, the apparent \"non-spicy\" chutney...has a little heat to it. Not too happy about that either. Otherwise, this place offers that contemporary dosa dining experience that is very cool and unique."}
{"text":"One of the best Dosa places in Toronto. Only downfall is that you have to call and make a reservation. They are always packed unless you get Lucky during lunch but if you're going for Dinner don't even bother going without a reservation unless you plan on take out."}
{"text":"Took my parents who were visiting from India for a south indian treat. From their endless list of Dosas and other south indian snacks we ordered for 1 signature mysore paper dosa, 1 plate of \"Medu Vada\" and my folks ordered for their standard masala dosa. We all loved the way the Dosas were made, the timing of the service and the speed in which our order came. Our waitress Simran took notice of our needs for some side dishes and chutneys to be served without garlic and she made sure it was taken care off. We washed down the dosas with a hot cup of filter coffee served in a two cup south indian style. By the end of the meal we were convinced we were in an Indian restaurant in India and not in Toronto. All in all, whether you are a seasoned Dosa lover or a newbie, this is the place to visit for your Dosa cravings. PS - dont eat breakfast/lunch when visiting as their portion sizes are humongous !"}
{"text":"Awesome food as ever!!! It is unbelievable how it tastes the same year after year!!!! Service is also amazing.  All together five stars and worth the 30KM drive from downtown on a weekday!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food..Great atmosphere... great services.. The most test bud craving recipe is \"RASAM\"..All in one - if you visit caledon and not visited guru lakshmi dosa cusine - worthless visiting caledon...Truly loved the place"}
{"text":"First time trying dosas - and like the first time I tried samosas and mimosas (see what I did there?), it was love at first sight (and taste). How comforting, how filling, and delicious.   We arrived on a Thursday evening around 6:30 PM and the place was packed. We had called ahead of time and booked a reservation, so we were seated right away. We ordered the Spinach (Palak) Dosa with cheese and a dinner special, as in the pictures attached.  Wow. The dosa was crispy, yet soft, with generous filling. Super savoury meal, and full of complex flavours that I can't even describe. Filling was cooked and spread perfectly. Portions were large, but we had no trouble finishing off our meals - you can't help it, you just keep going. Each bite was addicting. Service was also very helpful and attentive, despite how busy they were.   My one regret is not asking or identifying the varying sauces in my dish (see picture attached - I'm a noob, sorry). I kind of just free-for-all-ed it and dunked my dosa in each one before gulping it down. Take time to figure out what each sauce comprises of - in retrospect, I know it would have allowed me to appreciate the meal even more than I already did.  For two people, with tax, and tip, our total was $30.54. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The only downside is you don't get a table if you don't call in earlier to reserve it on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great food...great service and lots of options for everyone. Lots of gluten free and vegan options for everyone. It's very busy so always make reservations."}
{"text":"A very good place to experience the South Indian delicacy called Dosas: Crispy rice flour crepes filled with spicy potato filling. We tried several types. The spring cheese masala dosa paired with Sam hat and the three chutneys was just perfect to hit the spot. The masala dosa could have been more crispier but the 30 min wait for the Uttapams was worth it to the second. These dosas were the nearest I could find with the authentic dosas from a Dosa hub called Sankalp back home. Decently priced and authentic paired with fast service once seated. Just make sure to book in advance as this place stays crazy busy. See you again next time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best south indian food I have ever had in Canada. Also, the best service. Mysore masala dosa was the best."}
{"text":"Definitely it's one of the best Dosa Places in GTA!!!... and it's really r-e-a-l-l-y busy... totally packed!!! You must make a reservation to get seats, else the wait time can be v-e-r-y long.  The menu has great selections... lots of choices, and unique items which probably you will not find anywhere else. And even better, you can customize your dosa just like you want... in several levels of soft to crispy, mild to extra spicy, oily to not-oily.....  Though it's very crowdy, but the food comes pretty fast!!..... and it tastes great!!    Also, the servers and staffs are polite and helpful. They also try their best to accommodate the sitting options of your choice. The prices are a little premium than other dosa places, but considering the quality, taste, and options, it's rightly justified..... Overall it's a nice experience!!"}
{"text":"The reservation/seating attendants were not organized. The waiting room was very clustered and so were the workers. The mango lassi is way toooo sweet and taste like purée straight from the can.   Our waitress didn't come to take our order for a good 20 minutes. Then she never came back until the end to give our bill. The waiters are all running around like crazy people and you can't enjoy your meal properly. One of the waiters hit me in the back of the head with their tray.   The chaat dosa was great - highly recommend it.  However, the Rava dosa was not up to par. It took way tooo long to prepare. It was moist and soggy while it should be crispy and thin"}
{"text":"Love this place for authentic South Indian. Nothing beats their dosa and sambhar. Always a ton of wait so best to reserve on the phone in advance. Sometimes their service is a bit rushed (due to the volumes), hence I can't rate them 5 star. Great for vegetarians and vegan peeps! Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is supposedly the best place to eat dosa in ALL of toronto. I had to find out for myself and after going today, I am fairly impressed at this establishment. Every single thing has been thought out for the most convenience possible. The menu is something of a nature that I haven't seen before, with some of the items of a bizarre, but interesting nature. After trying some of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts, I can confidently say I would come here again.  The only downside is that this place is SO popular, that during peak hours you need a reservation. Also, there are so many servers and commotion all around, it is hard to have an important or intimate conversation. Regardless, the food was solid and I would recommend trying this place at least once. FYI - it's not on the cheaper side, so bring your wallet!"}
{"text":"I travel all around the world ( including Southern part of India), but never have I found such authentic South Indian taste!  Best South Indian Restaurant in my books!  I visit it every time I travel to Canada!"}
{"text":"Guru Lukshmi is by far the best South Indian restaurant anywhere around. After living 5 years+ in South India this is the only one that gets the approval seal!   Absolutely delicious food. I always have the vada(lentil bun) / idli(rice bun) combo in the beginning (dipped in the curry as it should be), an it's never changed. Always perfectly cooked and spiced. The rasam (South Indian soup) is yes very spicy but bloody delicious! But the key are the dosa's, I always try the basic first to make sure and it was great, hence I've tried a bunch of their dosa types and I've yet to find fault with any of them! All of them are just so good!!   Lastly make sure you have the Madras Filter Coffee. It brings back memories! Go there ASAP! An make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Having heard about this place from several of my co-workers I had no choice but to try it out.  Before going I decided to call (good thing I did); I was told I had to make a reservation. Being a weekday I was a little surprised but I made one anyways. When I arrived there was a \"bouncer\" outside the entrance to the restaurant. Since I didn't think he was an employee I said \"excuse me\" since he was blocking the door. I was hastily replied with \"no excuse you, do you have a reservation\". I replied \"yes\", he then told me to wait in the \"waiting area\". This whole ordeal made me feel as if I was entering a top secret area.  Fast forward to the point I was actually seated, I was greeted by our server, who very quickly made me order my appetizers and mains. Having never being there before I ordered the Green Chilli Dosa as my main and Idli as my Appetizer. Both were very good and I'd say better than most other Dosa places. The only main hindrance this place has is the service. The reason for this is that you feel extremely rushed the minute you enter, for an \"enjoyable\" dinner I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Best dosa I have had in my life and I have lived in southern part of India for many years. Even my husband who is not very fond of dosa loves this place.  The service is quick and the staff are polite and courteous.  In appetizers we have tried idly, vada,dahi vada everything was yum. But the thing for which you should go there is for their signature dosas. We have tried several of them and each one had its unique style and taste. Below are some of our favourites- Panner dosa(with cheese)  Spicy coconut Spicy Chana Dal powder dosa Pav Bhaji dosa"}
{"text":"OMG- amazing dosas and vadas! The sambhar is good (not as good as Udupi Palace in Artesia) but it's the scale of spiciness that's the real kicker! Love the choice. The toonie idlis are also pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Went with my family for dinner during March break. Had hear that it was usually super crowded so booked in advance - which was a good thing!  On a scale of 0-10, I would give this place an overall 7.  Service: Fast!   Menu: Extensive list of traditional and unheard of dosas! :-)  Taste: Ordered Kaara dosa (super spicy), chettinad dosa, vada, ghee roast dosa and Rava kesari! All were very good, Sambar was excellent. The only thing they got TOTALLY wrong was the basic coconut chutney. It neither had the texture nor the taste that it should have had. Bad fail that one!  Ambience: Poor. Very noisy, don't go there for the ambience!   Overall: Food place to get in, eat good food and get out! Book a table in advance!"}
{"text":"Have heard rave reviews and decided to check it out on a regular Tuesday evening. We were surprised to see it packed and waited just under half an hour to be seated. Side note: definitely make a reservation ahead of time.   We were greeted by our server, Simran, who excelled at her job. When the three of us coincidentally decided on the same dish, she offered great suggestions on what else we should try. I'm glad we went with her recommendations; was well worth it.   I'll be the first to say, I'm not the biggest fan of South Indian cuisine, but the food and service at Guru Lakshmi changed my perception. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Probably one of the best dosa places around.  Very flavorful, good portions, and good quality ingredients.  Definitely recommend it. :-)"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite Dosa place in Mississauga. They have the largest variety of dosa options and the restaurant is always really busy. The chettinad dosa was my favorite, as it's the perfect level of spicy for me. I would recommend you try Madras Dosa in Etobicoke as well. Still debating what resto I like more."}
{"text":"The dosas & chutneys were some of the best I've had. However this place has  a limited menu. Great for dosas & a few other things but thats it. Not worth the drive to Missisauga unless you are craving dosas."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious South Indian food. Must try one of their speciality Dosa's. In the flip side there are long line ups and slow service. They now take reservations, so make sure you book a spot to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Delicious, fun, great for non-meat eaters and decent prices. I've been dying to go back! Great authentic food!"}
{"text":"Amazing choice of South Indian food. First time there but will definitely be back for more.  The sambar was outstanding."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food without any doubt! I have been here every time I drive to Toronto! The only thing I don't like is how you always feel rushed to be out of there. I understand it's a busy location but I don't find it appropriate to be rushing your customers."}
{"text":"Super fast service and the food is fresh  and delicious. Their menu is a bit overwhelming but I am sure you can't go wrong ordering anything.  It's great food."}
{"text":"Best South Indian restaurant in Toronto! Owners are from Kerala. This casual restaurant is huge taking up 3 stores packed with Indian people every night that it's impossible for a walk in even at 8:00. We had to wait until 9:15 because the food is just that good. Everything is vegetarian with the best dosas and sides and sauces. You can order the dosa to be crispy without oil and substitute the soup for the other soup good for digestion with tamarind. Their rasmalai dessert and this like sweet almond paste dessert were really good, as was the paan!!! Yes they actually have paan on the menu which is like this leaf pocket full of digestive herbs and sweets. Make reservations or order take out! I wish I took pics but we just devoured everything so dang fast from the take out boxes"}
{"text":"Food and experience is great, waitress could have been friendlier but otherwise I would definitely come back. First time I tried dosa and I'm craving it again already!"}
{"text":"Sometime last year, a south indian friend of mine introduced me to the magic that is dosa. If you are unaware, a dosa is like a crispy crepe made from lentils and rice, and filled with a mild potato masala. I have heard from a few indian friends that this is the best dosa you'll find outside of india.  Once you've chosen from a wide array of dosa options, your meal will come with three unique and amazing chutneys ranging from mild to spicy, and a small bowl of warm sambhar, which is a vegetable and lentil stew which you can have mild or spicy.   You will eat with your hands. To do so, you rip off a small section of the dosa and use it to pick up the potato stuffing inside. Protip for first timers, the dosa gets more flexible the closer to the middle you get. Dip the crispy outer portion in your sambar and chutneys. Try eat with only one hand, as is customary.  Do not be intimidated by this place. the food is outstanding, flavourful, fresh and inexpensive.  Carnivores be aware this place is strictly vegetarian."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place for South Indian food. The taste has declined and the portions have become smaller.  The line ups are too long and left to college part time students to manage the reservations and line ups.  Even after making reservation we had to wait for 40 Minutes to get a table. Our order for 3 dosas took almost 35 minutes to serve and the taste waant even good. We will avoid going back."}
{"text":"Wow this place is always busy!!! Also be aware that the place closes on the weekend at 3 and reopens around 5. We were lucky, got there at 2:45 and put our names down as the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. I had heard about this place from my co-worker and my parents. As a Durham region resident I was interested in trying this place when I was in the west end.   The food was great, the ambiance was great, the service was very good which is key to me specially when I go to Indian restaurants. My favourite is the rasam, hot, very spicy, light broth tomato soup.. I could have a gallon of it. The vadas were delicious as well and I loved that they give you three types of chutneys. I loved each and every chutney!   This place is definitely a great place to eat South Indian food if you are in the area! There are comparable places in Scarborough and on Gerrard but I liked the service here the most."}
{"text":"This was really really good. They mean business when they rate how spicy things are... beware :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience , went out to have a good night with friends and left very disappointed. Started the night with dhai vada WITHOUT coriander and enjoyed it , later ordered masala dosa not expecting corinander , I don't like corinander so I asked if I could please have something done as I wouldn't finish the dosa.  They said I could order another one but would have to pay for both which is not a solution, and to top it off after asking for bills the server forgot and we waited about 30 mins before we had to ask someone else.  Definitely not going back, a lot more dosa places that have great food as well."}
{"text":"Great food, but they messed up my order, I ordered 4 things, brought me only one, then I asked to correct it, took another 10 minutes to correct my order, while I already waited for 40 minutes. But the food is great, the wait was worth it. I'll give it only 3 stars cuz of the poor service."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go and eat... south Indian dishes were world class... it was just like having dosas back in chennai.. I would definitely recommend everyone to try out this place if you to have authentical South Indian food..."}
{"text":"I am over the moon in love with dosa and Guru Lukshmi is the dosa king, seriously this is dosa at some of it's finest!  I have come here for the past five years at least and it has been popular the entire time I have been a dosa fan-girl. They used to be in this little strip mall, with the tiniest little eating area and there was always the same amount of people eating as waiting to be seated!  This location is a lot larger, cleaner and sleeker! What I really enjoy is the way they educate you about the dosa, on the menus and the televisions.. This is a great addition as not everyone knows how to eat the dosa, how to order the dosa or what to expect once the dosa comes and you are required to eat this huge paper crepe. It can be overwhelming for the newbies.  My boyfriend and I came here after returning from our cruise and we really wanted South Asian food. We ordered the idly and vada with the sambar on the side, the idly was light and fluffy, a very clean taste. The vada stole the show and I let my boyfriend eat his \"Indian doughnut\" which is a bit crispy and oh so flavorful! This is easily the best vada I have ever had! The dosa was amazing, there is not much else to say. I had a spicy paper dosa and it was great! Really fresh and crispy. I loved the green chutney it is always my fav! The service was great, really quick and friendly.  I love Guru Lukshmi and there is no question that I will be returning here. I love bringing people who have never had dosa before and watching their reaction when their food comes. Priceless!  If you can, come around six pm to avoid long wait times or come for lunch!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my family. We had booked our reservation 2 days before. When we went, it was all packed. I had heard that it serves very good food and was a famous restaurant for South Indian food. At first, we ordered mini idlis. The taste was very good and I loved its sambhar and chutney. Then I ordered Chettinad dosa with medium spice level. OMG!! It was soo soo good. I was definitely in love with sambhar. That taste has become my gold standard now. I would definitely keep going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly definitely more hype than anything. The prices are a bit high, and the service is below average.   Yes they have a lot of options for a make your own Dosa, but with more variety and quantity, there is a lower quality of Dosa."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying dosa and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. We arrived at 5 pm when the place opens for dinner and there was already a line up, I would really suggest making reservations! Overall the whole space was clean and tidy. The staff were attentive and fast. There are many dosa options on the menu and the staff assisted us with choosing the right one. The food arrived quickly and was delicious! Everything was tasty, fresh, and we finished all our food. I would totally recommend going here and would be returning."}
{"text":"A completely accidental find, I stumbled on Guru Lukshmi after sitting in my hotel room searching for restaurants and settling for GL because it was across the street. Quite nondescript from the outside in a bland strip mall, I was shocked to find it was a huge space, clean and modernly decorated and packed full of people! The next thing that surprised me was that they specialized in all vegetarian and Jain dosas (I didn't read the reviews, clearly), which I love.   After spending a good 10 minutes humming and hawing over what to get, I decided to go the healthy route and ordered a steam dosa with aloo masala ($8.50). With it being so busy, I expected my food to take a while so I quickly popped open Instagram to distract me from my hunger. Before I could even go back on one days worth of photos, my food came! As with all dosas, it was huge. Unlike the regular fried dosa though, the steam dosa was much thicker but still slightly crisp on the outside. It was complimented by 3 chutneys and a small soup. Surprisingly, the steam dosa was full of flavour and great texture. I was expecting something soggier but was pleasantly surprised by the mix of soft and crispy dough. The aloo masala was very flavourful, although not hot enough for my liking. Aside from the slight miss in temperature, everything worked in conjunction to make for a phenomenal meal. So much so that 3 days later and an hour away, I'm contemplating how to get back for another dosa.    Service wise, it's almost like a glorified fast food joint. Servers take your order, serve it and that's about it. But, it's quick, good and cheap so I'm not expecting fancy (nor would I want it). If you're in the mood for great South Indian food, definitely check this place out. Even if you're not, still check it out because these dosas are magnificent."}
{"text":"I've never eaten a dosa before my recent visit to Guru Lukshmi- I was missing out! Everything here on the menu is vegetarian and there is also no alcohol served here. I had the paper butter dosa and it came with 3 very delicious chutneys. Everything was very flavorful and filling. We also ordered a spinach dosa with a potato filling which was also delicious.  Luckily, I visited within the first hour that dinner service started so there was still parking and we were able to get a table for two right away without a reservation. The service here was good, friendly but not overly intrusive.   Looking forward to coming back here to try some other dosas!"}
{"text":"Mmmm dosa... I went to guru lukshmi with my friend around 6pm and it was pretty packed.  We got the tomato dosa with aloo masala, dahi vada (lentil donuts in yogurt), and the vegetable spring masala dosa. SOOOOOO GOOD. Everything we ate was exploding with flavour and spices. The dahi vada was very interesting and tasty, very savoury with the herb infused yogurt and donut combination. The dosa is HUGE. You'll definitely be full after one order! The tomato dosa was delicious with all the different sauces to enjoy it with. The spring dosa was also really really good. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area (or not, it's worth the trek to come down to try this place out!) prices were quite reasonable as well for the amount of food you're being served."}
{"text":"11:50am on a Saturday morning, 10 minutes before opening and there are five cars whose occupants are waiting to pounce on the door.  That has to speak to how good this place is.   Service was a bit slow but that gave us time to sort through the large array of choices. We settled for a traditional paper masala dosa and a spicy coconut masala dosa. Both were delicious but the dosas were oily. I'll heed the recommendations to ask for little oil the next time."}
{"text":"I do not understand how people are giving this place less than a 5 star rating. This is the most definite 5 star I've ever given on Yelp.  We have been to Guru Lukshmi maybe 20 times this year and it has never disappointed us. Yes, the place is extremely busy all the time. That's why you book a reservation and arrive on time! We never go there without a reservation because we don't want to wait around for an hour, hoping to get in. When we get there with a reservation, we are always seated right at our slotted time, or within a minute or two, which is incredible for how many people are trying to eat there.  The service is impeccable as well. They have maybe 50 waiters running around taking orders and they're always around when you need something. If I need more sambar, I get it within a few minutes.  I know some people may not like the rushed feel of the restaurant, but it's part of their system. They have to seat and feed so many people, so they're trying to get orders fulfilled and bills paid quickly and efficiently. We are usually in and out of there within 45 minutes, which is amazing for a restaurant. Personally, I love that we don't have to sit around for 2 hours just to eat dinner.   Overall, this place is amazing and I think anyone that gave it less than 5 stars needs to go there again and truly evaluate the quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing world class dosas and chutnies!!!! You must try their special dosa with the bhaji (vegetables) added to the Mysore Masala Dosa. A little hint is to get your masala (potato mixture) on the side, it keeps your dosa crispy!!   BUT one star is missing because the place is so jam packed you can barely stand................please expand!"}
{"text":"I have never had a South Indian meal that compares to the Spicy Channa Dal Masala Dosa they served me two nights ago. The place was packed at 9 PM, but staff managed to find me a table, and Simran guided me to the perfect choice amongst a dazzling selection of entrees. I would make the five-hour trip to Toronto just for one of their dinners."}
{"text":"The one star review! On a regular basis, my guests and I frequent Guru Lakshmi and for the most part we love it, just as most of the reviews here point out. Good food, good service and atmosphere, so why the one star review? Its more about the entirety of the restaurant that goes beyond the food and service but dwells deeper on a situation most people hope to never find themselves in while eating out, especially at a place they consistently go to and trust. Trust you ask? We all in some form or another trust a restaurant to provide us with food of good quality, and also in the event of a dish being served with its quality being in question, would expect a level of professionalism and care that would rectify the problem. That's exactly what didn't happen when we found a hair in one of our desert items. Not only did it spoil our apatite but the restaurant did nothing to correct the situation. No replacement no nothing.  The funny thing was we asked for a clean and fresh replacement but they simply did nothing. We left paying the full bill no deduction for our issue even though we never consumed the desert and no apology or any sort of reason given for the situation we found ourselves in. Will never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food in Toronto... we had idly in starters that was really good.. sambhar and coconut chutney were perfect..  I had pavbhaji dhosa that was amazing with topping of onion , coriander and capsicum... I even tried mango lassi it was good .... my wifey had aloo chat dhosa with topping of tamarind. She was quite happy with it .. must say you will definitely over eat after visiting guru lakshmi if you love south India food.. trust me guys go for it and last but not the list always reserve your seat before going becoz there is always lot of rush.."}
{"text":"My very first visit to Guru could've gone wrong, terribly wrong.  After reading the numerous yelp reviews and seeing that they now take reservations, I immediately took advantage of it and emailed them my details.    After I got off work, I noticed that the email bounced back, so I didn't have reservations after all.  AND when I did get there, their reception area was a madhouse, people everywhere, and a constant stream to replenish the ones being seated!  Majority of the people who were dining there, at least on a Friday night, were Indian, so I think it speaks for their authenticity.  Another tip off was the Indian man, seated next to me, who kept gushing, \"Oh, this sambar is delicious!\", \"Just like Bombay\", etc.  Anyway, here's the deal:  Unlike some of the reviews, service was actually PLEASANT.  They wait-time they estimated was accurate which was good!  Even though the host only scribbled the first 2 letters of my name, he actually didn't forget about me, another bonus!  Despite the hustle 'n bustle, all the workers seemed sweet, including the waitress.  Food:  Ordered Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa + Pav Bhaji Dosa, both medium, off their \"Creative Creations & Signature Dosas\" section.  HONESTLY, after trying both of them, I couldn't really separate the 2 as there were only slight differences.  Both were good, although I remember liking the Mysore slightly more!  Medium spice left an indelible, slow-burn in my mouth - not a bad thing! :)  Menu:  Can be a bit overwhelming if you're not familiar with what these dishes are.  There is also various options of spice, oil, crispy level, and whether or not you want cheese (not authentic):  http://www.gurulukshmi.com/food.html  Portion Size:  Just the dosa as a main was enough for me!  Only water, no dessert.  I just wished that I had more space (or larger party) to share some of the apps, like idlys.  One more thing, I can't believe this place is veggie.  Carnivores, TRUST ME, you won't miss a thing!"}
{"text":"Being a South Indian by heritage, I grew up eating idlis, dosas, and vadas fairly regularly. Going out to eat South Indian food never held much of an appeal...until Guru Lukshmi that is. Their service is very fast and helpful (true story: my extended family of ~10 eaters was incredibly impressed when a server managed to recite, from memory, the complete order of our party).  The ambience is more 'bustling' than refined, but let's be honest: you're here for the food and food alone.   Absolutely everything we've tried to date is fantastic - from their appetizers, to dosas, to their lassis and filter coffee. What brings my family back time and time again is the unique flavours and combinations of their dosas. The only downside is its fairly remote location. Come here, you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"I've been going to guru lukshmi since they had their stall in the Newin centre way back when (I wasn't even in High School yet!).   The food has always been consistently fantastic. Their sambhar is always rich and flavourful, the chutnies perfect and the dosas just divine.   The restaurant can get packed so make sure you make a reservation or avoid going at peak hours.   My recommendation: Start with baby idlis in sambhar or rasam vada, then go for the mysore masala or coriander dosa (the latter if you can't tolerate spiciness) and then end off the meal with a traditional south indian filter coffee."}
{"text":"one of the most mouth watering dosa places I have been to outside of india. It is perennially packed, so make sure you reserve a table especially on weekends. They are pretty responsive to emails/phone. Service can sometimes make you feel rushed but with their high turnover, I am hardly surprised. Ambience is quite upscale with comfortable seating. I usually get the idly/vada combo dipped in sambar. The taste of the sambar reminds me of home. For dosas, they serve 3 different chutneys. Dosas can be super crispy at times so make sure you request the right consistency if you don't like your dosas  crispy. I will go back here in a heartbeat, usually we take  friends and family who visit us here."}
{"text":"Guru Lakshmi has the best, and highest quality Indian food I have ever tasted. This is the best dosa you will find in Canada, and in fact, is even better than anything you will find in South India(where I have travelled to once). The most exquisite flavour combinations, and the highest quality ingredients combine to make this an absolutely mesmerizing taste experience.   This place has high standards, and the chef's goal is for the food to remain true to its Tamil Nadu roots. The Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa, Spring Dosa, Cheese Dosa, Pav Bhaji Dosa are a list of the ones I've tried- and they are all fantastic. Every time I go here, I am conflicted as to what to choose since everything ont he menu is delicious.  The Idli is pretty good too, and so are the Vadas. Being Maharashtrian, the several marathi cuisine infused flavours sit well with me. Owing to the large Punjabi population in Canada, most of the Indian restaurants here serve Punjabi cuisine, so having South Indian food is a nice change.  I love this restaurant, and have been here more times than I can count. Please do yourself a favour and go here today!"}
{"text":"Beware of inaccurate pricing on their website.. I phoned and placed a pick up order for the \"Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa.\" When I went in to pick it up and looked at the receipt, it was a WHOLE $2 more (21% increase) at $11.50 instead of $9.50 as displayed on their website.   I couldn't really do anything at this point since my order was already made, but I would have chosen a different item if I knew there was such a large price increase. Not sure why they wouldn't update prices on the website since most people placing pick up orders would be referring to those prices..  The dosa itself was alright. However, I chose \"Very Mild\" and my tongue was already burning after one bite. It seems all those options of less oil, no oil, mild, very mild are probably just a gimmick, and the dosa is made the same way each time regardless of your preferences."}
{"text":"The best of the best... even beats NY south indian. Best spring Masala dosa, sambar vada, veggie utthapam and mini idlis in rasam. Yummmmm!!! All the way!"}
{"text":"Been a long time customer of this quintessential South Indian fixture in GTA. However, off late it would appear the original owners have taken a back seat. Gradual decline in taste and quality cannot go unnoticed for those who have savoured GL's dosas and sambhars over last decade. Service was never GLs priority, but even that's been beaten.   After having made reservation, we show up 5 mins before time to be tersely told off by the greeter, holding iPad but dressed in loose cheap t-shirt. He certainly lacked politeness and finesse expected from host/hostess. He lacked all of it and backed it up with a terse \"one person wait in waiting area and rest of you can wait in the car\" Excuse me? His partner in crime was equally (over) excited shunting patrons inside door, them showing them their table from distance \"go sit there, near the wall\"   Order takers take order and never show up to second check ask if we got what we ordered. Do we need anything else. No one showed up for more orders? We asked at least 3 times to have our server sent to the table so we can order more.    Food taste is subjective hence I don't want to comment. However, let's just say it's not the same as it used to be. Most hilarious part was the dessert \"frozen\" yogurt's serving size. Even the 3 year old at our table looked like \"what is this\". Smaller portion than sample size.   All in all, GL better pick up the loose ends. They don't want to just thrive in the market due to lack of other choices. Cuz All it takes is someone who makes decent Dosa and backs it up with service. Wish them best."}
{"text":"A very popular place so a reservation is important.  Menu is large with plenty of Dosa's available, a lot of my friends and relatives rave about this place for the Dosa selection. My third visit and each time the experience has been less than perfect, ordered the Mysore paper dosa this time which was crispy and huge, and probably enough for 2 people.  Tasted ok as it was not that different from other South Indian places visited,  potato masala, sambar, coconut and other sauces were as expected.  Not good value due to the higher than average price.  Each time I have come here, end up wondering why I drove so far when another place closer to home would have been just as good, than I realize it's because most people I know really like this place.  Even today we are here in a group.  Tip:  they do not seat you till all members in the reservation are present to prevent a person from holding multiple seats."}
{"text":"Came here today on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with my family. We had a reservation and only had to wait a couple mins. We ordered a paper masala dosa, channa masala dosa, paneer dosa, and salty dahi vada to start among the 3 of us.   The dahi vadas were delicious. I don't normally like them but these were so well done that I could have eaten a few orders for myself! We ate them so fast that we didn't even take a picture.   The dosas here are perfect. The right consistency, texture, taste, and the perfect amount of crispiness.   All of the chutneys were delicious. I found it was the right amount of chutney and we didn't need to order more. Just a side note that they make these fresh daily and charge $0.50 for each extra chutney. The white and green coconut ones were my favourite.   Service was pretty good. Food also came out really quickly. They didn't take too long coming to the table and checked on us to see if we needed anything.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is Dosa heavan in the GTA. It came highly recommended and i was happy to have tried them.  The variety is great in just the Dosa category. Appetizers are also excellent.  A must to finish the meal of with a Madras Filter Coffee.  Price wise, this is cheap.  Expect to wait - they do take reservations, but you will still wait for a little bit.  If going with friends, bring cash because they don't do split billing on the weekends."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. There is always a long wait, so if you are going with a huge party..it's better to do reservations. I love their dosa's. The service is great and you don't have to wait too long for the food. Masala dosa and Mysore dosa are my favorites in the menu. They have some very unique dosa options...so if you are into experimenting this is the place. I will highly recommend this place for dosa"}
{"text":"Their food is good but the wait one have to do for it is too much. Don't even think of going to this place without a prior reservation. I have heard waiters telling poor lads to wait for 2 hours to get seated. Even if you have table reserved you have to wait atleast 10-15 min to get it. Apart from food there is nothing good about this restaurant- too crowded, tables too close to accommodate which sometimes is a deal breaker for a guy like me. Lastly, food is A-class but management needs to think about expansion or simply improve service timings."}
{"text":"Finally! A decent meal in the GTA!  I'm in the area regularly, but never have a car, so I'm always stuck eating at the mediocre (at best) places over on Courtneypark. This time, I had a car and resolved not to eat crap! Yelp directed me to Guru Lukshmi and promised me delicious, authentic dosas, which I was pretty excited about.  The interior is much nicer than you might guess from the drab strip-mall façade. It's sleek and stylish with crystal light fixtures and giant booths for big groups. They appear to always be busy, so expect more than a little bit of chaos. When I arrived, a sign at the door said \"To be seated, proceed to waiting room\" with an arrow to the left - except, ummm...there isn't any waiting room or area. Back to the door I went, and eventually was seated. The very second I sat down someone was there ready to take my order - before I had a chance to even open the menu....  And once my order was placed, they promptly asked me to move to a different table. Okay.  All service weirdness aside, the dosas really are the best. Everything here is completely vegetarian and they offer specific Jain options if you need that. I picked a chole dosa from the specialty menu which was filled with tasty chickpeas. I do like that you can specify \"low oil\" and \"extra spice\" - both of which I did. My dosa arrived in mere minutes, overhanging the very large tray and served with sambhar and 3 very delicious & different chutneys. I loved it.  If you're relatively new to S. Indian cuisine, the menu does a great job of telling you what's what in terms of flavors. They didn't really tell me if I was supposed to break apart my giant crepe or roll it up like a burrito or what, so I just sort of ate it with a spoon. No matter how you eat your dosa, you're going to have a great, cheap, 100% vegetarian meal with some very interesting service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always clean, friendly and packed! But the wait is worth it. The takeout is packed nicely. The Idly Vada in Sambar, the spicy coconut dosa and the Mango Lassi are all amazing!"}
{"text":"Its really good food but the service isn't great. They try and rush you to finish up your meal as quickly as possible and try to accomodate others. I wish I could spend more time enjoying my meal as opposed to being rushed."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the staff is rude and illmannered. Employer needs to recruit staff with some human ethics. On top of this please watch out for utensils. Glasses had lipstick marks and spoons were not clean at all. If you want to enjoy food, recommendation would be to bring your own utensils :)."}
{"text":"Awsome dosa, place, food, service except wait time.. but it's all worth it... Love it..."}
{"text":"Outstanding south indian restaurant! Unbelievable variety of Dosa.  Must visit if near Toronto airport.   Tip - Make sure to reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat dosas but pathetic service. We reserved table, but had to wait 30 mins inspite of that. The tables were shaky and not good experience to eat. Will always prefer to pick up from here until they improve the service.  My favs to order - coriander dosa, chettinad dosa!"}
{"text":"Being an avid lover of dosa I had to try this place. Friends in Mississauga raved about this place. Being a frequent customer of various South Indian restaurants around the city, my palate is very familiar with this cuisine, so Guru Lukshmi had better measure up. In my opinion some of the best South Indian food still resides in Scarboro..but let's give sauga a chance :p  My first impression of this place was that it wasn't really much to look at, but who came here for looks? Surely I didn't. I mean you could tell they did try to give it that sophisticated look, but with the table arrangement, it doesn't work.  First and foremost, this place is small!  I mean really small. So don't invite a big gang or show up with a party of 10. The place was busy, we got seated quite promptly. Maybe its just me, but I found the seating not comfortable at all. It was like I was kinda leaning forward! The service was excellent, organized mayhem is what I would call it. When it looks like everyone is confused and doesn't know what is going on, the place still hums along..and they get your orders right.  All that aside, the food is what brought me here and I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the vada sambar, in fact to this day I still think about that. It was very authentic. Since this place has so many different dosas to choose from, the owner recommended we try a bit of each! So we ordered about 4 dosas, and they cut it up for us so that we could have one piece of each dosa! That was simple but it went a long way in me giving a thumbs up to this place!   This place is the real deal, the best in Mississauga. The owner did mention that they are opening a new location, so if I were you, wait. Once the new location is open, then check this place out, I'm sure the overall experience will be better."}
{"text":"Amazing dosa, worth every penny. Not a great fan of desserts at this place since its famous only for dosa. I have been several times to this place and never disappointed with the taste. All dosa'a taste exactly what it describes on menu. Delicious idli and uthappam too. Highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"My family and I are from the southern part of India and we were craving some good Indian food when we were vacationing in Canada. We found Gurulukshmi and the place was jam packed when we walked in. But it was worth the wait! After we ordered something it always came piping hot and it tasted soooo good. Everything we ordered came in a line so we could finish something without other food going cold. The specialty at Gurulukshmi is their dosas. They were so crispy and just plain delicious. There are so many varieties but my family ordered the chole dosa, butter garlic dosa(which tastes just like garlic bread) and mushroom dosa. They were warm when they came to our table and they were really good. They were also decently priced. If we go back to Canada we will definitely dine in Gurulukshmi."}
{"text":"As the only non-South Indians in the place, we were wowed. Our 1st time dosa meal was a great surprise. Delicious, fresh coconut flavours, friendly and helpful service... very cramped location but they are moving soon! Definitely worth trying if you're adventurous and ready for some tasty heat. YUMMY!  PS. also great for my daughter who is wheat-free, as the Dosas are made with rice/chick pea. Tonnes of choices for her, which is never the case in restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. I've heard about this place and decided to try while visiting Toronto. Fours stars because felt the place was too crowded and tables were too close to each other. Service is really really really BAD!! But, Food is good, lots of varieties in Dosa."}
{"text":"Being from Brampton i am used to eating Punjabi food... PERIOD! So going out for Dosa was a different , but great experience. First off, this place is busy.. Lunch service on Fridays, Sat, Sunday only, dinner service all week. This place is veggie and no booze at all, which is fine by me. I went for a lunch service on Friday and it was a business crowd so service was quick. The service was great and the place is spotless. Being new to Dosa i had plenty of questions and the server was more then happy to discuss with me how they work. Essentially picture a medium crispy crepe lined with a variety of Indian spices, potato, mushroom etc. This comes up some chutneys and a lovely;y lentil soup.  They have kids ones as well with chocolate, sprinkles etc.   I WILL BE BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Over-rated.  My wife's grandmother is a dosa fanatic. Annually, we go to a new dosa restaurant in the GTA to satisfy her craving. For the most part, I like going to establishments that are hole-in-the-wall when it comes to dosas because number one, there are several and two, even the dives are tasty. With Guru Lukshmi, it's basically \"trademarked\" fusion dosas in a decor that echoes Turtle Jack's.   I had that Pav Bhaji Dosa. When I was in grad school in the US, I often had store bought Pav Bhaji (the microwavable ones) because I was homesick and desired Indian food once in a while. This \"trademarked\" dosa was basically that package smeared between two thin naans. That being said, the sambar was spicy and satisfying. The accompanying chutneys were good.  The service is mediocre. Beyond that, making a reservation should be a requirement. Otherwise you will be packed into a 8x8 room with 30 people likes sardines in a can and waiting up to an hour. I was thankful that I only had to wait 5-10 minutes with a reservation.    I applaud Guru Lukshmi for trying to be creative and for that alone I do recommend going to this restaurant. That being said, call to place a reservation and make wise choices with your meals. If you want a run of the mill, simple dosa - this may not be your cup of tea."}
{"text":"I was there with a few friends Friday evening! The restaurant was empty!! -food was below average -bad attitude -super expensive for a low grade MADRASI resto -I will not recommend anyway to go there with their bad attitude -they declined separate checks :(:(:("}
{"text":"We had a reservation, however we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated . I have never seen so many different varieties of Dosa on a menu, definitely worth it to explore. Dosa was not as warm as I would have expected. The food was just okay . The mango lassi was good . The filter coffee was okay- not up to my expectations."}
{"text":"We heard so much about this place from the Indians ever since we moved to Toronto, so thought to give it a try. Unfortunately, based on our experience, it is more of a hype than substance. I would definitely opt for Anjappar Chettinad which is less than 5kms away from this place.   We went for Rasa Vada and Chilli Bhaji as a starter, followed by Andhra Masala and Spicy Chana Dal Masala for the mains. Rasa Vada - Rasam had too many onions and other vegetables and the taste wasn't any close to the actual Rasam which I have had in South India. Having said that, the vada was actually very good. The star of the meal was actually Chilli Bhaji. The heat was great and it was very close to the ones I used to have in Hyderabad. Andhra Masala was good - nothing wrong but nothing amazing as well. Spicy Chana Dal Masala wasn't much spicy even after specifying the same. But it was still well made. Dosas didn't live up to the hype created by the locals.   The service was actually lightning fast, even though it was their busiest hours. Our first starter, Rasa Vada, arrived within a minute of placing our order and the rest of the stuff didn't take much time either. What took time was the billing, but we got hold of one of the employees to take care of that as well.   Overall, it has got some good South Indian food but nothing compared to the hype it has - maybe they used to be amazing in the past."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars.    It has all the criteria I want in a dosa - crispy and good fillings (but not too much).  It can get very spicy though so, for those who doesn't like it too spicy, I would go for the milder flavors.  If you like it slightly sweeter, I would recommend the coconut masala dosa.  But, I'm sure they are all tasty and the fillings really come down to personal preference.  It's more like, what would you like as your filling - tofu, chickpeas, potatoes.  Then, you decided, how would I like it spiced?  With Coriander, coconut flakes, chili, etc...I know the menu can be overwhelming.  The sambar was extremely tasty and delicious.    We also ordered the Idly (the steamed rice cakes) and I really enjoyed that.  It was extremely soft and fluffy.  I would definitely order it again.  Would I wait 45min to an hour to have this?  Absolutely not!  Would definitely recommend sending them an email to RSVP.  I think if I waited 45min, I would have been too cranky to enjoy it and probably would not give it a 5."}
{"text":"This place is one in a million. The ambience, service, and staff are great.  So accommodating and so well organized. Everything is spotless and clean! The taste, presentation, and quality of the food is unmatched.  You just can't beat it, or find this anywhere else.  The taste of the dosas are better than any dosa I've even had in India!!  We live in Houston, and we just can't wait to come back to Mississauga just for guru! Everything is perfect, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am frequent visitor to Guru Lakshmi. I still remember the first time i had Dosas there, it took me back to New Delhi, India. For me that's a good thing because something that reminds of me of back home means ,food is pretty darn good. However since their increasing popularity and now expansion, i feel like that quality/ taste of food is in a declining state . First time i gave them the benefit of the doubt but the second time and third time i didn't get the satisfaction or that feeling when the food \"Hits THAT Spot\".   Also now i would like to talk about their service, i have never seen any of their staff smile not when they are welcoming guest and not when they greet you at the table to take your order. On our Last visit as soon as we were done with our  food without even asking for a cheque they presented us with a bill, as i am paying for the bill  someone immediately cleaned up the table  while we are still sitting there . I felt it was bit rude but then again there were several people outside waiting for the customers to leave so i understand that.  Overall the food is still miles ahead of any other Dosa place in the GTA area,  but the actually experience of eating at the place needs some improvement.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Their food is just okay. And my experience going there couple of times, has made my opinion stronger.  There are far better south indian restaurants in Mississauga area than Guru Laxmi"}
{"text":"Great food! Only gripe I have is the fact that they don't do split bills on the weekend, that doesn't make any sense to me. But other than that, the food is great, the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the finest south Indian restaurant in GTA (if I say in north america instead of GTA, I don't think it would be any exaggeration). Great one very friendly staff, amazing food, great environment, beautiful decor and most importantly individualised attention by the owner. They have got great verities of dosa and other south Indian dishes. If you are in Toronto (GTA), you must visit this restaurant. Just make sure you call in advance and make a reservation or be prepared to wait at least 30-40 mins in line.  One of my personal fav."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I like the food and my family likes the food and that's why we keep coming back. Having said that, service is terrible terrible terrible. Every time my family decides they want to eat at Guru Lukshmi I cringe because I have to make a reservation well in advance, deal with wait times even after making a reservation, deal with standing in a small packed wait room ( the size of a match box), deal with a watch guard at the door who won't let you step inside until your table is ready, deal with having to sit tightly packed in table arrangements so close that you cannot have a conversation without being conscious of the next table, deal with food being rushed to your table (only place I have seen them getting half my dish while the other half is still being made)and finally deal with waiters waiting for you to finish your meal so they can clear the tables.   I get it, the place is popular and lot of people want to come in. But then, this is not the only popular place in town. There are tons of other restaurants that are popular yet better managed. If the goal of Guru Luksmi is just to serve good food they are doing a good job at that but if they want to win customers and want them to keep coming back for years they better improve their service. I was there this weekend too and the guy at the door taking in people was so thin on patience that any question to him about when your table would be ready would blow his fuse. He literally yelled at me in front on my family and other guests and he pointed his finger at me in a gesture which was extremely rude to me. I take my family out for a meal to enjoy and not to get insulted and stressed out. Ironically, Guru Luskmi has a sign at their front door \"It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice\". I kept wondering who that sign was meant for!   Guru Lukshmi you have a lot to learn in customer service. Please take not of what your customers are saying. If someone from Guru Lukshmi wants to talk to about this review I can be reached at bhagat.ali@gmail.com. I will more than willing to share details and my inputs regarding my experiences."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!  I've been at least a dozen times, and Gurulukshmi is consistently good!  I've taken a number of people, including my very picky mum and MIL, and both LOVE this place.  I usually get the Mysore Paper Dosa without the potato filling - it's huge, but easy to work through because it's all dosa and no filling.  I've had the Chaat Dosa, Chole Dosa and Pav Bhaji Dosa and they're all good.  For starters, get the Medu Wada.  The chutneys that come with the dosas and most appetizers are amazing too!  The ambience is pretty decent and the bathrooms have always been clean (this can be hit or miss at some Indian restaurants in the GTA).  The wait staff is incredibly efficient, although the folks at the welcome desk aren't always on top of their game.  Still, it works.  This place is HUGELY popular and always busy - I highly recommend you make a reservation regardless of the day and time you're going."}
{"text":"Best dosa in whole north America... No one can beat gurulakshmi... Service is top notch...."}
{"text":"Lots of great  choices but lacks desserts. Customer  service  is horrible. It  is always packed  because of its amazing  food.  Needs to hire more waiters."}
{"text":"This is my to go to restaurant for whenever I crave for dosas. The variety they have are endless, which makes it impossible for one to get bored of the place. But even though they have such so many choices I tend to order the chaat dosa, which I am obsessed with and is not available at any other dosa restaurant that I have been to. This, along with the plate of 14pc mini idli, is what has made me a huge fan of this place. This place is crazy busy, so if you don't book a reservation then don't bother coming. Therefore my complaint is that whenever one does get a table they tend to rush them with their order and service so that they can get you out and let the other customers in, which I understand as they are trying to get as many customers as they can, but it does get frustrating when I am yet eating and they bring along the bill and start clearing things from the table. This restaurant is not meant to be a fast food place, but a nice sit-down restaurant that you would like to spend at least half an hour in. Unfortunately, unless you stall your ordering and eat really slowly, you will be in and out as if you just ate at McDonalds.  Overall, the food is awesome but the service needs some adjustments, and this will still be my favourite dosa place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This is our second time to Guru Laxmi. I was craving South Indian and after a few bad experiences at other places had to make the drive here.  Our first time we ordered too much and couldn't quite finish the food so this time we just ordered one Mysore paper masala dosa, one madras coffee and one Rava Kesari.  First off - the service improved tremendously since the first time there. One person took our order - I think her name was Kushboo and another server brought our food while she was tending to other guests - quite streamlined. All polite and willing to help.  The food was excellent. The dosa was crispy and large enough for us to share. We were quite full.  I'm a huge fan of good rava kesari and although I first thought that the portion size was small, it was just enough for us to share again.  Between service and food quality - I can't give this place anything less than 5 stars. They earned it."}
{"text":"Having been lucky enough to have homemade dosas with good friends, I can say how lovely it is to now have this option to tied me over between visits with them!!  Delicious, authentic, full of flavour and textures.  Tried the rava dosa and thoroughly enjoyed even at the mild level!  Make reservations ..its busy weeknight and especially Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"I think I'm a lil bit speechless after my experience with the Tofu Vegetable Spring Dosa at Guru Lukshmi, but I'll get it together and pen this review.  A little background. I love dosa almost as much as I love pizza. I'll let that sit with you for a bit.  My favorite South Indian places are to be found in Hicksville, Long Island, and I had a feeling that I'd be able to get something in that league in a similar pocket of the GTA. Kris U promised me that Guru Lukshmi might make me the best dosa I've ever had and man, he was right.  I'm a spice fiend. And I love coconut anything, really. Crispy crepes are my jam, man. South Indian food is vegetarian-friendly and vegan aware. No hidden ghee or yogurt or cheese in anything (though you can get this here if you like!). Our waitress was utterly amazing and helpful and pointed both of us in the right direction of what we were looking for.   I had never seen such a variety of stuffed dosas before! This is where they are leagues ahead of my favorite traditional hole in the wall joints on Long Island. They also allow you to adjust spice level (and suggest that yes, you might be as \"crazy\" as them and want your level at 120 percent. Next time I'll trust them on that because 100% wasn't that spicy for me, but that's OK).   Because South Indian cuisine is vastly different from the more ubiquitous Northern variety, I undertand people might feel a little intimidated by it. Take your chances and come here. You can start with something simple and safe and just as delicious as the more daring and \"extreme\" varieties. Heck, they even offer up a tutorial on the menu! You can order your dosa with or without cheese, crispy or soft, with or without potato, etc.   Getting back to my chosen dosa. What I loved about it: so flavourfully spicy, so wonderfully crispy and wrapped around spiced tofu chunks and shredded vegetables. But listen. No matter if it's your first, second or hundredth dosa, you MUST COME HERE because take it from a dosa-loving lady, this is the best fucking dosa I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delete those painful memories of eating crappy dosas at all those shitty `dosa` places. This is the real deal. I have eaten at a lot of dosa places in NY/NJ area and Guru Lukshmi is as good as it gets. The food tastes fantastic, incredibly fresh and of high quality at very reasonable prices. Great ambiance, friendly staff. Sambhar and idly aren't exactly heavenly but one of the best you can have outside India. The chutneys taste great. I would definitely come back. Good job guys, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Almost ate my fingers at Guru Lukshmi!  Guru Lukshmi is a South Indian cuisine dedicated to all thing dosa. The only and the best way to enjoy dosa, is with your hands. If you are eating with fork and knives, you are at the wrong restaurant. There is something beautiful about eating with your hands. It fuels not only the body but also the mind. The messiness is part of gastronomic art!   My companion and I shared three dosas, all out-of-the-world: onion rava dosa (sorry celiac folks! this deliciousness is not gluten free), spinach palak dosa, spicy coconut dosa, all served with aloo masala, chutneys and samba! By the end of our meal, our plates are filled with vibrate colours of green, red, yellow and white; our hands are filled with aroma of ayurvedic spices.   Pro Tip: Call ahead to make reservations on Friday, Saturday or Sunday to avoid disappointment! Alternatively, arrive at 8:00 PM to ensure a seat!"}
{"text":"Good Dosa Place, Rava Onion With Aaloo Masala was undercooked a bit. Mango Lassi is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Food is great, decor is great, service is a little brisk but very accommodating.  Ever since my first time here, I've developed a bit of an addiction to the chana dosa (chickpeas). It's spicy for me but there is just something about the punchy full flavours that I love, so I sit there nose dribbling, eyes running, mouth smiling and stuffing in more. You'd never miss the fact that nothing on their menu has meat! The chutneys are absolutely delicious and help offer relief from the heat.  The decor itself is very classy and modern.  The service, while a little bit cold, is very fast and accommodating.  If you love Indian food, definitely try this place out. It'll give you a taste of something different from your average butter chicken and naan."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??  Their dosas!! This is my second time here and I love their dosas.   What appears as a light meal...actually might not be true, my friend. The aloo masala or their potato is actually quite filling. So before you decide to order any appetizers, I suggest you finish your dosa first and decide if you can eat more.   Each dosa comes with three chutneys and a sambhar all for dipping your dosa. Being known across the board by Indians as being one of the best places to have vegetarian dosas, this is definitely a place you don't want to miss out. There's always a line waiting, tables consistently have reservation plates on the tables and the restaurant is already bustling with people right when they open.   The taste is very flavourful and if you like spicy, the dosas can definitely be very spicy. The dosas are huge and if you get the paper one, it's extra big and extra crispy. Lots of filling in each dosa and very filling for lunch and for dinner.   LAST TIP??!  If you want to try the dosa the first time, the garlic dosa with aloo masala is a good choice. When you have more friends with you or if you come again next time, you can try the other ones too! Make reservations!!! Because if you don't, expect to wait in line then!"}
{"text":"Wow.  If there is such thing is dosa heaven, this is it!  I ordered one of the trademarked (this is SERIOUS business guys) dosas, the coriander one was just the right amount of crisp and refreshing.  The vadas and idlis were on point.  Vadas were perfectly fried, the idlis perfectly steamed, and the coconut chutney was fresh and delicious.  I also ordered the ginger lassi, which was an intriguing combination of flavours - spicy and salty, yet slightly sour as well.  Service was very accommodating, but once it started getting busy we were shooed out.    Side note: we went at 6PM on a Tuesday night, which was not so busy, but when 7 hit it started getting pretty jam packed.  I only shudder to think what it might be like on a weekend.    Tons of parking in the strip mall."}
{"text":"this is 3rd trip to Toronto to enjoy some delicious Indian food. My stops on the food trip to Toronto :- Tim Horton,  Maroli, Tandoori flames, Lahore paan and kashmiri tea, King dumplins, guru laxmi.  I love the the wide spread of Indian and south Indian varieties on the menu. The dosa are fresh crispy and delicious. Like the fact that you can customize the spice level and oil for the dosa.  My favorite so.far has been pav bhaji dosa and spring dosa. Mini idly with rasam is delicious starter and love the puri korma dish. The rava masala dosa well-made and again delicious and crispy. Liked the onion utapam too. Ended with yummy yogurt kulfi and Madras coffee. Overall .. top place for South Indian dosas.they have double their floor space in.last 3 years but still you may have to.wait in line during peak times on weekdays too"}
{"text":"I came here on my way back from Niagara. Had heard great reviews from my friends and wanted to try it.  Ordered a SPL Mysore dosa and a rawa dosa. It was good , cant think of any issues with it but you can only go that far with dosa. I wanted to try a proper south indian meal but almost 90% of the menu is dosas. Will definitely give them credit for the variety of dosas though . If you have never tried dosas, I will definitely recommend it as I haven't seen a larger variety of dosas in any restaurant. Both the  service  and decor is good , I believe, mainly  because of the very attentive manager who seemed to have an eye on everything.    As for me,I would have come again had I lived close by .However , since I stay almost 40km away, I will instead try the saravana bhavan nearby if I have a craving for dosa."}
{"text":"Food was very good, price was a little high for my liking. I asked for a little more of the coconut dip, and was told that it would cost 50 cents for a few table spoons, no other dosa place does that, it is just wrong.   For that reason alone I will not be returning .."}
{"text":"Unbelievably fantastic dosas!! These are authentic Mumbai style dosas and the best I've eaten outside of India.  The chettinad dosa with potato filling and be sure to get any dosa you get here at a 100% spice level unless you can't stand spicy food at all. The butter plain dosa with potato filling is a solid fail safe choose too as is their rava masala. Those are always a win.   The condiments that come with the entrees - rasam, sambhar, chutneys are all exceptional.  Lastly, the idli's and vada's are a good choice for appetizers.  I took away one star because the service is sub par on a good day - but who cares when the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is most awesome place to try dosa if you are eager to try some new types of dosas. Love it every time i visit. Staff is really friendly and environment is clean.  Only drawback is that the place gets crowded quickly and loud. So reservation is must. Otherwise, one of best places i have visited with family."}
{"text":"Highly recommended spot in North America for excellent Dosa - love the different stuffing's, variety, crispiness and of course top it off with chicory flavored Madras Coffee. We tried the Dahee (Yogurt) based Vada with Boondi toppings for an appetizer, then the Mysore Bhaji Dosa and also a Aloo Dosa as well. Very popular spot. All the Dosas get coconut, cilantro, tomato chutneys as accompaniment plus the savory/tart \"sambhar\", which a light soup made with lentils and vegetables."}
{"text":"Get there during the weekend and you'll be faced by a nightmarish long queue waiting to get inside. The food is excellent. However the staff are a harrowed bunch and it's no wonder...The constant pouring in of customers.  They need a larger place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our anniversary with our cousins and the service was great! There was such attention to detail and our food tasted amazing. Our server was very professional and we loved the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Great vibes, great food, and great service. The owner was told it was our anniversary and they brought out a dessert for us with a candle, they take customer service to a whole new level. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"One of my colleague told me about Guru Lukshmi and how good was their Dosas and Filter coffee..That got me hooked and was reading reviews and posts and it made it to my list to check out definitely.   TIP - The place has limited hours and days of operations and they are crowded. So get a reservation done before you get there. Call them before hand to find out their holiday hours and you would find them open though their site has different days/hours.   We were a party of six and had a spread of different Dosas (Indian Lentil Crepes) and their menu offering. So here they are: 1. Dahi Vada (Salty) - OK..not great. I have had better Dahi vada elsewhere. But liked their presentation and this is one of the few places that put Kara boondi over Dahi Vada...I love that 2. Medu Vada - OK - nothing special about 3. Kara Dosa - CAUTION - Super and extremely Spicy - but test your spice level 4. Spring Masala on Garlic Butter Dosa - very good - really good 5. Rava Dosai  - been a while had such a crispy real rava dosai and it was just pefect 6. Podi Uthappam - Wasn't spicy as the Kara Dosa was but it was good size and perfect blend for the Uthappam 7. Chole Dosai - The chole masala was very good and the dosai was crispy. My niece had it managed to finish half of adult size dosa 8. Mini Ghee Idly in Sambar - was very good. I liked the way they had the coconut chutney in the middle - very nice.  They had more choices and their some of their dosas are their Signature and have Trade marked - WOW my first time where someone trademarked their Dosas!  The main thing to note is all the dosas came with Sambar and three chutneys - White Coconut Chutney; Green Coriander Chutney 'hands down the best I had'; Red - Tomato/Onion Chutney 'Spicy & Tasty'  I ended the course with their Madras Filter Coffee...I had an expectation for the coffee and it was not met. I felt something was missing in the coffee..may be it was the too much milk they had in my coffee or not so strong coffee decoction! I still liked the Saravana Bhavan Coffee..  The service was excellent. From the hostess, to the waiter and the staff all took care well, in spite of the crowd they had to manage. Kudos to them!  GuruLukshmi is definitely in my list to go again and try other dosai varities."}
{"text":"Extraordinary is an understatement !! Authentic taste, fantastic ambience !!"}
{"text":"The experience was a little beggardly.  They have reduced the number of dips that come with their crepes.  I went here last year, and my crepe came with a potato dip that was really good - but it is gone now.  *They do not accept American Express*  I was overcharged on a dosa compared to the price that was listed on the menu. Isn't that illegal? Is that how you roll in South India? Haha.   You can save on a crepe dip, charge me extra unlawfully, and save yourself one percent by not taking Amex. It's alright. Your food was okay, not that good, and I am not interested in whatever shenanigan you might surprise me with on a later visit, so I am not planning on coming here ever again.   Too-da-loo"}
{"text":"Awesome food, really enjoyed it. The taste was authentic south Indian and service was excellent. The trademark dosas were the highlight."}
