{"text":"Went to go eat at this place as it looked interesting and close by my new neighborhood. One of the worst indian fast food joints in the city.  Food was tasteless and soggy."}
{"text":"Very friendly service kept reminding me that everything was homemade style. 

The butter chicken ($7.99 + $1 scoop of Daal curry) was small and not cheap, why couldn't they have given significantly more rice? The food is pre-prepared hot table style and ready to go. The butter chicken tasted good and the Gulab Jamun ($1 / ball!) were also good as well though they were served on a lid (with a hole...) for some reason (!?).

No washrooms, really small seating area. I'd go again only for the much cheaper daily specials."}
{"text":"I usually order the chicken and beef curry dishes....  flavorful and *fresh . Their samosas and desserts are delicious too. I usually order to go, but there is an option to sit in (only space for a couple of people)."}
{"text":"I rarely give one star, but I am sorry, this place deserves it, the samosas where cold, the curry had two pieces of cauliflower, not worth the $4.99. The food is greasy and not flavourful, just hot. The guy kept on asking me how I liked it, I said it was good, but it's really not. Skip this place."}
