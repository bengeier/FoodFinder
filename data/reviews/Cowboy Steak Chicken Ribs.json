{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because the food was great.  After figuring out which door to go in (needs an Entrance sign), we tried to sit inside. Music was so loud, you can't carry on a conversation. Moved outside, but the there were so many flies,we had to protect our food. I doubt that we will return as there are too many other restaurants in the area without these problems."}
{"text":"My family and I went here last Friday. Great looking place. Layout was good. Staff looked nice and helpful. The food on the other hand was ok. Not bad but a bit of a let down. Maybe we didn't try enough items yet. However, there was a lot they were out of. CHIPOTLE much. Over done in that department. If you want it to be a place where kids will eat, don't put it in your Mac and Cheese especially. Brisket was a little on the dry side. I would also get another recipe for the bread pudding because that it was not. It was dry croutons of sorts with a little Carmel on it and a bit of whip cream.  We will go back maybe in a month or so in hopes they worked out the kinks and dialed back on the Chipotle."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and decently priced. Go early or do takeout if you don't want to wait in line for a seat."}
{"text":"Fast casual restaurant with really good food and great service. The brisket tacos were really good and so was the filet which was a nice surprise for a place like this. The staff was super friendly. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 5/5

I tried Cowboy last night for the first time. I ordered the tempura chicken tenders plate with fries and mac and cheese, and added a side of the black bean soup. The tenders come with dijon honey mustard and they DO NOT HAVE RANCH for dipping. As a true southern ranch lover, this was difficult to take in! The pricing is expensive for what it is (5 small chicken tenders and two sides for $13 or 3 small chicken tenders and one side for $8....if the tenders were larger this would almost be acceptable). 

It took about 15 minutes after we ordered for the food to come to our table. You order at the counter and seat yourself, then have a dedicated server to help you from there. The tenders were very good with a very flavorful breading. The fries were just okay, very thin (think thinner than McDonalds) but they give you a lot. I would have liked them a bit thicker but overall they were decent. The mac and cheese had a good flavor but there was way too much of the cheese sauce (as other reviewers have said). Then there was the black bean \"soup\"...it was very chunky with many diced veggies in it. It was like a veggie dish with a little liquid...not very souplike in my opinion, and the flavor itself was just weird. I can't even pin the flavor or what made it weird, perhaps just the plethora of ingredients. 

However, the service was AMAZING. More restaurants need to take note of the friendliness and helpfulness of this staff. While most of the staff appeared to be high school kids, they unexpectedly overdelivered on service.

I do want to mention that the food to table process needs to be improved. You are given a tracking device to put on your table. It must not track that well as I watched one server carry a salad around the restaurant about three times (and outside) over the course of five minutes while she looked for the correct pager. I saw multiple instances of food being taken to incorrect tables and/or \"auctioned off\" in confusion. 

Overall, I'll give this place another try because of the service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during a weekday and it was packed. But there was plenty of parking left and the ordering process was quick and efficient. We had our food taken to our table when done which was surprisingly quickly by a very pleasant waiter. The waiter came back to check if we liked our food and to ask if we needed anything else. The food was excellent.  My husband and I had burgers perfectly done! Love this restaurant and will go back!"}
{"text":"Cowboy has a good concept and they just opened so I should likely forgive them for failing to execute on that concept. However, due to the owner having experience with two other local restaurants to my knowledge, I'm reluctant to give a pass. Let me start by saying the food was awesome. My wife had the rotisserie chicken tacos with street corn salad and black bean soup. I had the brisket tacos with fries and collards. Everything was cooked well and had great flavor. The black bean soup was awesome. My problem comes from the ridiculously long wait to place an order. I shouldn't have to wait 25 minutes to place an order at a \"fast\"-casual concept at 8pm. They need another order station which can be turned on to accommodate rush hours. The employee placing the orders was ridiculously slow as well. This needs improvement. The wait for our food was probably another 15-20 minutes which is fine in a sit down restaurant but not in this concept. 

Nothing fast about this fast-casual setup but the food is good. Either improve the processes or give it up for a regular dine-in experience. The food is good."}
{"text":"This place does good quality meat and salads. Fresh, well seasoned, and fun. A bit of a wait to order...but it is enjoyable to crack a beer while waiting (nice choices) watch the crowd and hard working staff (they never stop). It is not perfect yet, but you can see the adjustments. This is our 3rd visit."}
{"text":"Not sure what the poor reviews are for. This place is great. Got the brisket tacos with street corn salad and Brunswick stew. All was excellent."}
{"text":"So a manager at Cowboy saw my first review and reached out to me. So we tried Cowboy again. This time we got the bbq brisket platter with corn and Mac n cheese, rotisserie chicken taco basket with salad, & the bbq brisket taco basket with fries. The bbq brisket and Mexican street taco salad were delectable! The salad with blueberry lemon dressing was really good too...that dressing was super yummy...& I don't normally partake in dressing (I know that's weird but I just like a little olive oil on my salad)...but that dressing....   The taco was fine. It could have had more slaw & filling in general, but it was fine. The bbq brisket and fries was great. Oh and the cucumber tonic was super refreshing! Try Cowboy out!"}
{"text":"Food is not good.  Meat is chewy!  Not a good place to go!  Keep driving and go to McDonald's.  Food is better and less expensive."}
{"text":"My husband had the brisket and said it was very good. I had the chicken tacos, which were delicious. We both really liked the fries, also. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"After having been to 131 Main and Tenders, both restaurants by the same chef, I was looking forward to visiting Cowboy. I got the rotisserie chicken basket with corn salad. Both were delicious, but the portion for the price wasn't worth it. $9 and it was a 1/4 Chicken, and I'm sure it was less than 3 ounces. The salad was 1/2 a cup. No bread to go with it. Unless they change their portion sizes, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the best place we have had bbq since moving here from Los Angeles almost a year ago! The atmosphere was great. The service was amazing and everyone was so friendly! The food was cooked to perfection and the smoky taste was to die for! So happy we could finally get in since it has been jam packed every night since it opened!"}
{"text":"These crappy reviews make me angry. This is probably the 3rd review I've ever done and its because I feel like I have to. I work in a restaurant and have done so for 16 years. This place is the bomb. I've tried all of their salads which are amazing and my boyfriend has done tacos, salads and another meat dish that I can't recall. The prices are not high as the \"yelpers\" say. We spent $26 on lunch which I think is average unless you normally order from the dollar menu at McDonald's. Super reasonable prices and actually impressive for a place that doesn't even have a freezer!!! The employees have been so awesome every time we've been and I've literally considered poaching them to come work at my restaurant...they're that good!!!! If you have someone in the industry raving about a place, trust me, it means something."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my second visit to Cowboy. On my first visit I ordered a medium rare ribeye with Chimichurri and horseradish sauce, however I never received either one.  My fault for not noticing and requesting the sauces.  The Mac and Cheese tasted more flour than cheese.  Taking into consideration that my first visit was around the time they opened, I could overlook these minor discrepancies. 

On my second visit, I placed  a takeout order of ribeye steak, requested to be cooked medium rare with the Chimichurri sauce on the side (as stated on the menu) as well as a side of horseradish sauce.  When I picked up my order, I was told that the Chimichurri sauce was included, however it wasn't.  The ribeye was cooked more medium well than medium rare and lacked any type of seasoning.  A little salt and pepper would've gone a long way to making the steak taste a lot better.  

I sincerely hope that this restaurant improves over time but at this time I cannot give a better rating than a two (2) because the experience has been the same in both visits, several months apart."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at Cowboy. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was even better. There was a long line for lunch, but it moved incredibly fast, and the food came out quickly. It was super convenient and delicious!! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I came in one day for lunch, yes they were just newly opened so of course there was a wait but in my opinion, it was worth it. I ordered the tempura chicken sandwich and absolutely loved it! I did find that the basket they served the sandwich in made it quite difficult to pick up and put down which then made it turn into a mess but still, delicious.
The company I was with felt the same way, the baskets make it difficult to cut food, pick up sandwiches and then everything turns into a pile. I love the functionality of the restaurant. It is a great casual feel and even though you order up at the front, they don't leave you hanging and forget about you once you sit down. There are waiters/waitresses that walk around asking if you need refills, how your food came out, etc. 

Definitely a place to go back to and a great addition to our town!"}
{"text":"Cowboy is a fast-casual steakhouse. You order up front and then find a seat where they bring your order to you. I had the ribeye and it was well seasoned. It's good when you can eat steak without sauce.

The best sides are fries and the side salad. Cowboy still needs to improve on most of their other sides."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have decided the best thing to order is the brisket.  The 1/4 chicken was just a little dry for my taste (really glad I didn't order the white meat) but the flavor was very good.  The sides are OK and absolutely loved the collard greens.  

Cowboy is still working out their kinks and the ordering procedure is much smoother now.  Although the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the greeter was just over the top.  He was ridiculously excited and just needs to dial it back, step away from my face and respect personal space.  We will probably return, just not in a hurry to do so, but will be back."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience and I'll definitely be back.  Ironing out the kinks with the \"new restaurant crowd\" but in time will flow just fine.  

Came on a Friday night wanting to eat outside by the fire pit and corn hole but all tables were full...came inside and shared a table with another family.

Food was actually very good!  I ordered the bbq brisket tacos with corn salad (OMG SO GOOD).  Hubby had the beef brisket with baked beans and fries.  He rates the brisket a 8.5 out of 10.

This restaurant is close to home and has adequate parking as well.  The salads look hearty and tasty as well!  Let ok'ing forward to my next visit with family!"}
{"text":"Brunswick stew was like water. The  Chicken tenders coating fell off the meat quicker than Trumps girlfriends clothing, making dipping it into the sauce a mess . The French fries were as limp as a 99 year old Monks member.  50% of the BBQ sandwich had large strips of fat running through it.( they brought a \"lean\" cut sandwich back, which was fat free). The large single rib order was 30% fat. The \"Creamy Coleslaw\" had nothing at all on it, totally dry cut up cabbage, even I could make it better than that as I would have at least added some mayo to it.
  And to add insult to injury, gave me diarrhea.  Stay far away from this place. You don't open up a place to the public with this many problems."}
{"text":"Needs Work

I would like to describe this place as organized chaos but there would be some debate about using the word \"organized\"

They opened about a week ago and my wife and I went for the first time last Saturday. Nice and airy feel but a bit on the noisy side.

Concept is you walk in and you're immediately in a line to place your order. Hostess is there to give you a menu that your cans study while you are in line.  Eventually you get to the end of the line where they have one person who takes your order, enters it and of course you pay. Having only one person there to do all this slows down the line somewhat but that may  be the objective ie. slow down the order process and not overwhelm the kitchen.

They then give you a tent to place on your table and they bring your meal to you.

In my case, I had hip replacement surgery 10 days earlier and the hostess    volunteered what they could do since I am on crutches, is for us to find a seat and either my wife go through the line or they would send someone from management over to take care of our order.

Since I do not do well on extended periods on crutches just yet, this seemed to be the best option and it was appreciated.

Found a seat and a few minutes later, a young man came by to tell us why they could not do that for us.

My wife started to get up when a third employee showed up to take our order and by this time it was forget it. Let's just have lunch and make it as uncomplicated as possible.

My wife got up, got in line and 15 minutes later was back with a tent. Did manage to score two glasses of tea in the meantime.

Lunch showed up shortly.  My order was the Rotisserie Chicken Basket (all white) with Baked Beans.  Very good and their house BBQ Sauce is very good.

My wife had the Tempura Chicken Tenders Basket  with Dijon Mustard Dipping Sauce and Baked Beans. 

They forgot the Dijon Mustard Sauce and had to go back. The Chicken Tenders Basket for what you get is very overpriced. Should have gone with the Platter for only a bit more but a lot more meat that the three tenders found on the basket.

All in all, not bad but not a great value either compared to other places in the area. Nice and fresh but as pointed out before, very noisy and hard to have an intelligent conversation.

In the end, they still have not figured out to role of the customer as evidenced by the conflicting messages we got at the beginning.

Next time I go, hopefully I will be off the crutches and let's see what happens then"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this restaurant to open up because every restaurant Joe Douglas opens is delicious. Well IMHO he missed the mark & maybe it's because it's so new & we will give it another chance.  Like a good Texas BBQ joint you stand in line but there was only 1 cashier & the flow was slow. I also didn't like that I had to walk through the people standing in line to leave the restaurant. There is only a single door & maybe a double door would've made a difference. We got there @ 6:00 & were told they were out of tacos. We had brisket sandwich & rotisserie chicken. Brisket did not have a smoked flavor. I was hoping we'd have an experience like the Smoke Pit in Concord but we didn't."}
{"text":"I went today for the 1st and last time. I entered on the Statesville side of the restaurant and as I entered I ask the girl can I sit anywhere and she said yes.
As I sat for about 5 minutes I flagged down another worker and told her no one has come to my table. She then informed me I needed to place my order up front. 
While I looked at the menu prices 
they seemed to be fair until my food arrived. There was barely enough food for a 5yr old to eat.
I gave it a 1star because the food actually was fantastic. But I cannot get by with uneducated workers who obviously have not been trained properly. Not to mention the price gouging for the small amount of food you receive. Finally the service was horrible. Most of the workers just stood around in there little groups. Gotta do more than just serve good food!!!"}
{"text":"This is destined to be great. 

The concept is amazing. The food is very good. The only reason didn't give a 5 is growing pains. The staff is still learning the systems. 

But again - the beef brisket was excellent and the apple pie was made fresh in store!

We will be back often. 

Ps - love the fact they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting the opening of this new restaurant.  I did not like the method of ordering to start.  I would rather be seated with the menus to have enough time to make a selection.  I guess this is more of an upscale tenders type of faster food service.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with French fries.  The presentation was fantastic.  The beef Was fatty and chewy.  The bun was the best part with the barbecue sauces.     My daughter had the chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese.  She loved it.  My wife had a kale salad .  She was a bit disappointed.  

This may be a place for the younger crowd

We returned a second time this last Wednesday night. It was after 8 pm and the line to order took over 30 minutes.  That was just to order. The food took another 20 minutes to get. I tried the chicken tenders.  I like chick fil a better.  Just not a pleasant event.  Sorry not my thing. Good luck. You have to go back to seating people at a table and ordering like a normal restaurant."}
{"text":"Huge crowds today but things went smoothly, salads were excellent as was the service. Please don't let this \"opening enthusiasm\" fade with time."}
{"text":"What's not to love?  The best brisket I've had in Charlotte area, hands-down.  Assclown Beer on tap AND multiple varieties in cans.  Plus Todd Snider in the radio while we were here.  I'm in love!  

I also tried the tempura chicken - very tasty, tender and moist.  The fries are a seasoned shoestring that was tasty.  Decently tasty BBQ sauce.

I really love the fact that they have a hyper-local craft beer program.  Assclown , D9, Primal, Eleven Lakes are all represented (it helps we love in a GREAT home for craft beer.)  Plus there's some Anheuser Busch like Wicked Weed for those who hate craft beer.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food & service were great! Fun new restaurant in Huntersville! We went for lunch on a weekday, so not too crowded. We loved all of the outdoor seating. The only issue we had was that it wasn't clear which door to come in, & the ordering process was a little different. But overall, we had a great experience, & the food was fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had rib eye, sent first one back, too chewy, raw.
Second one over cooked, dry & tough.  Great rub had good flavor.  Mac and cheese was awful, cook tried to spice up this traditional dish; backfired.  Servers were good and on the ball.  Back room just needs more time to polish their skills.  I'll try again in six months."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was fantastic and the staff is very attentive to clearing the tables and refilling drinks as needed. We had the chicken tacos, the brisket tacos, the ribs and the brisket platter. All were amazing!"}
{"text":"Thank you for your comments, Joe D.
Funny on the timing. My grandchildren wanted to try Cowboy last night so we did.
First of all, this not a family friendly restaurant. The ordering process is still very annoying especially with small children in tow. NO children's menu, so now we are ordering adult portions and managing the sharing process.
Food is about the same as last time. Nothing special. The 3 children are mac & cheese lovers and they did not finish one portion shared with 3.
Is the chef or management tasting what is being served??
No more, simply not worth it."}
{"text":"I took my family to Cowboy for an early dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing, specifically the ribeye (it was cooked perfectly) and my wife loved her Big Blue salad. The restaurant was extremely clean and noticed the manager being very thorough with his spot checks. 

The whole staff was friendly and very attentive. Our primary server, Abbey, was quick and knowledgeable. Overall fanastic experience, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place needs a ton of work. I am being kind rating it a one. I cannot begin to say how disappointed I am after months of anticipation. I have read previous reviews and the only thing I will add is they better step up in every aspect from speed of order to quality of food and down to the simple stuff. For example do not label the condiments in bold with the day of the week but rather the content. For $30 +++ for an adult and child it was extremely disappointing. For the amount of $ they invested I would hope they read these reviews and make .

Round 2.
Gave this place a couple months. The good news is the food is pretty good. But, this service concept they have just does not work. Instead of a table flag we were given an electronic device similar to the type you get a restaurants that make you wait for your table-get where this is going? The young man taking our order informed me that while we have some self serve drinks at the drink station- like water, drinks can be ordered at the bar or at our table. I opted for the bar. I am not even going to comment, avoid that move. Joining my family at the table no less than three sets of servers came  to deliver us food, none of the three times it was ours. Apparently the new electronic devices they're trying have a malfunction. Our main server introduced herself and then our food was delivered by the fourth group who seemed relieved they had accomplished their mission.  My suggestion, can this walk up order and deliver to table system that does not work."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check this place out and today was the day.
We arrived for dinner just before 5:30pm and just before the rush! The ordering is a little unique. You start the line with menus, with the kitchen behind glass to the left and a trough filled with iced cold bottle sodas (haven't seen a Nehi peach in a while) and beers to the right. You grab your bottle beverage and then place your order with a cashier at the end of the line (you can also order a fountain drink at this point or sweet or unsweetened tea) They give you a transponder and you head to the tables either inside or out. Couple of things we noticed: way too cold on the inside and outside at sunset, they could use some drop down shades, but we chose outside. I had the mixed brisket (lean and fatty) with collards and Mexican corn salad as my sides, ($17) husband had the beef rib with baked beans and Mac and cheese ($19) daughter had the Tempura chicken tenders with fries and Mac and cheese ($15) Brisket was great and you get a generous serving- collards were still firm which I prefer but a little too spicy maybe. The beef rib was rich and very fatty and just ok- baked beans were just ok. The chicken tenders were delicious and the homemade honey mustard served with was tasty as were the fries. The downer at the table was the Mac and cheese- it was overly cheese and lacked flavor. The highlight was the Mexican corn salad! Spicy, crunchy, not too heavy on the cream deliciousness!! Both husband and daughter sent the Mac and cheese back and requested this item. This is a must order side. Our meal including two beers and two sodas came to just under $70. Unlike another review , I would MUCH rather have spent this amount at this place then at Chili's. Actually no comparison., I do believe we would come back but I think they could fine tune the service- for $70 I kind of would rather a waitress take my order from the table rather then wait in line."}
{"text":"Our meal certainly did not live up to expectations. Service was fantastic. The food- not so much.
Brisket had zero smoke flavor - like a chuck roast - 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday - they were out of tacos out of sandwich rolls.   Friend 2 of the 4 orders came out wrong.    Will not be rushing back"}
{"text":"Service was miserable food was worse. Despite having over 15 employees visible in the dining room, no one approached to help on my first visit. I didn't know what to do so I walked over and asked somebody can I sit anywhere and they said yes. Five minutes later somebody comes over to me and asks can they help me at which time they told me I was supposed to go up and order up front. I had the brisket tacos and the black bean soup. The brisket tacos were actually cold, colder than room temperature. And the black bean soup was literally room temperature no semblance of heat. I just hope I don't get sick. When I spoke to the manager Billy, he didn't seem to care, wouldn't give me the contact information for the owner, and with this supercilious grin on his face just said thank you.. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So I was pretty excited to try this place when we drove by & seen it was being built. We expected a long wait since its new, so I'm not going to rate that at all. Once inside, the smells were amazing! It's pretty cool to walk past the glass & see them making the rotisserie chickens, cutting steak & brisket. 
I ordered the 2 brisket tacos w/out the pickled onions & peach habanero bbq with fries. 
Hubby ordered the brisket with Mac & cheese & baked beans. We sat outside because it was so loud inside. They had cornhole & putt putt for people to play, pretty cool. Once the food came I added their homemade bbq sauce to my tacos. The brisket wasn't dry, the coleslaw was ok. I tried the Mac & cheese, had some heat to it, but good. Hubs enjoyed his food, nothing he bragged about or said he needed to come back. In fact, we both felt $35 was ridiculous for this type of place.
I know the owner also owns 131, which we haven't tried since we moved here last year. However, 131 seems to be a place you'd dress to impress & going in you'd know you're going to spend big. Cowboy was more than we spend at Chili's & we get more food there.
At the end of the day, we wanted to try it, so we did but nothing really makes me say *I need to eat there again.*"}
{"text":"The restaurant is bound to success as it is owned by the same owners as 131 Main, however, there are few things to work it out. Maybe needs a couple of months to get better. We decided to come eat here early as I was imagining the lines are insane (new place obviously will have lines -- specially in this overdeveloped area) and there were about 5 families in front of us. This was at 5pm on a Saturday with great weather. As we sat down (10 minutes later), the line was outside already.

The ordering process is somehow chaotic, you are given a big menu when you enter and you need to choose before you get in line and there are only 2 cashiers to process orders. You also CAN NOT sit before you place your order, which makes a pain for families with children. However, I did see a lot of people holding tables. The service is good, there are waiters coming all the time checking on you, giving you refills, etc. That's a great plus.

The food tasted good, however, I would advise the restaurant that steaks do not need to be over seasoned. Steaks are to be done with salt and maybe a hint of pepper. That's it. I could only taste their seasoning and not the meat, which made the experience a bit worse. I ordered the mac and cheese for a side and it was very cheesy, cold and did not taste good. The brisket was really good, in line to compete with top notch BBQ restaurants in the area (Midwood, City BBQ).

I ordered the Apple Pie for dessert as one of my friends reviewed it great. It was okay. It was microwaved which made a bit rough and wasn't even warm. 

However, I would still probably go back (maybe in a couple of months). If we could get a seat outside, it would have been much nicer with this weather and their nice patio. However, since you can't sit until you order, it makes it harder to get those tables in a nice day. I think the restaurant needs to change that. You need to order FROM TABLES. This concept of ordering first, then seating, it is just bad for any business. It makes look like fast food that wants customer to eat and leave ASAP. If they are looking for loyalty, they need to change that concept, but, at the same time might get even harder to sit down during busy times."}
{"text":"We went during \"Opening Week\".  That might have been a mistake.  VERY long wait times.

You order at the front and hope there is a seat available when you finish getting out of line.  

Food was good but the wait times were LONG.  

If you are trying to stay Keto, this is place is hard.  Not many \"low carb\" side options.  

We will try it again after the newness dies down."}
{"text":"So...we've been waiting for Cowboys and on day 3....we had our first experience. Here goes.... coming in the menus were given to us and somewhat explained, make your selection and come back up here to order. 

Ordered brisket plate with beans and fries. Delicious, really good tasting and tender brisket, excellent beans and COLD fries. The fries have potential. If they would have been HOT...wow.  The other order was chicken tacos, my partner liked them, I thought they were bland cuz you know I sampled. Black bean soup was the side, unfortunately it was cold.  Ok flavor but probably good flavor if HOT.  Nice beer selection, craft local beer. Thank you. 

Plenty of young staff walking around trying to be helpful. Probably in training. So AOK.  

Suggestion: while the cloth napkins were a nice touch, when enjoying barbeque and various sauces: paper towels would have been an excellent addition. Nothing fancy, just throw some rolls on the table like they do at Bad Daddy's. We'll be back and I'm confident they will have the kinks smoothed out!  Welcome to Cowboys!"}
{"text":"1st visit review......1 star

Had the bone in beef rib. For 18$, they should at least give you two ribs... I was still hungry after I ate probably 3-5 oz of actual edible meat(mostly fat). The meat I ate was tasty but they need more. I will be back to try something different but if I am still hungry when I leave, I will not be back. 
I did not mind the line and seating. I thought the atmosphere was great and people very friendly. At least you can have a beer, soda or a glass of wine while you are in line.
Bottom line, I feel they should give a little more food for the buck.

2nd visit......5 stars

Ok, tried cowboy for a second time and I have to say I was very happy and pleased.. I still will not ever get the bone in beef rib... this time I tried the brisket sandwich and it was awesome. Plus I shared a ribeye steak and that was really tasty as well. I was stuffed by the time I left not like last time when I was still hungry after. Enjoyed this time with great service and food.. I will be back again.... 3 stars only because they should get rid of the bone in beef rib and maybe get some baby backs...I will change this to 5 stars when they remove that beef rib.....The only thing they should get is toothpicks.. apparently, they were all out."}
{"text":"I can't give a four star as I am not a \"fan\", but I will certainly go back. The food was fine as was the service. I had tacos which were average and my wife enjoyed her meal. The french fries weren't cooked quite enough, but that doesn't mean that they weren't the way others prefer. It is convenient and the food is fine, so I can only be honest and give a three. I wish them success and believe they will always be a destination of many as they are a good fit for the area. I believe that a three is a pretty good rating for a place without tablecloths and fine cutlery."}
{"text":"We walked in around noon on Monday, there was a steady flow of patrons but not overly crowded. We were greeted, given menus, and were instructed to order with one of the young women with iPads. After placing our orders, we were given a number and picked a seat for our food to be brought out to us. Not even five minutes later, I had a hot platter of food sitting in front of me and it looked delicious. I anticipated a bust of flavor as I dug in for my first bite but instead disappointment set in. I really had high hopes considering Cowboy is the sister restaurant to 131 Main. The food was flavorless. The \"cheese\" sauce on the macaroni was thick and grainy. It reminded me of a failed attempt I made a few months ago to make vegan macaroni and cheese from puréed vegetables and nutritional yeast. The batter on the chicken tenders were too soft, the chicken was falling out of it. The tenders were paired with a honey mustard dipping sauce but it was actually the consistency of salad dressing. The collards greens were ok, a bit too greasy & too much sausage. My husband ordered the tender sandwich, but gave up eating it after a couple bites because the bread was too hard and the tenders kept slipping out of the tempura batter and onto his plate. He agreed that the chicken was in need of some seasoning but he loved the fries.  So my takeaway is that Cowboy has a lot of potential but they can't compete with Tenders with the food they're currently serving up."}
{"text":"4 times there
Not one edible meal
Rotisserie chicken cold, dry, soggy skin
Brisket sandwich-whole slab of fat, no bark, cold meat
Beef rib-very fatty, no bark, well done but not tender also cold
Brunswick stew- cold red Smokey and very spicy red broth very little else
Bread pudding-dry bread, stale tasting tough enough that it requires a knife to cut a bite sized portion
Banana pudding tastes like overt sweet, canned vanilla pudding with sliced bananas tossed in. 

Barely passes as a restaurant. Many other places in the Charlotte Metro area are much better. Cowboy is like an egotistical Easterner wearing a cowboy hat and riding his stick piney into a western. 

Stay away, save your money there isn't anything worth eating there!"}
{"text":"Far exceeded whatever initial expectations I had set! Brisket was a solid 8/10! Whatever you do don't sleep on the Mac and cheese! Absolutely out of this world!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for lunch today and it was highly un-organized. Now the food was good, I'll give it that. But we went up and ordered and they gave us a bill that we couldn't pay and we had to take the bill to our seats. Then at the end of the meal we had to track down our \"waiter\" and he took the bill and then disappeared then came back finally took our credit card and then he signed & paid. Whoever the operator of this restaurant is - needs to know that when people are done eating they just want to get up and leave especially at lunch with all the Traffic in the area, you just want to go. I don't want to wait another 10 minutes to try to pay my bill. I think the only reason they are doing this is because they want to give their \"waitresses\" a tip. For what - bringing me a refill of iced tea. I can do that. They need to do away with the waiters and waitresses and just let people bus their own tables like every other restaurant around and do away with this silly policy of not paying when you order."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon heading home got out of the bedlam that is Statesville Road in Cornelius in the evening and noticed that the place I'd been waiting for to open for a while looks open with people coming and dining and hanging out on the patio and all like that.
Greeted at the door and given a menu but little direction about how to complete a food-for-money transaction... maybe I'm just bad at fast casual dining, but if someone thinks I need a menu stuck in my hand as I enter their business they really should fill me in about my dine-in, take-out, or take-it-outside options while they've got my attention, and maybe point me to the appropriate \"order here\" person or kiosk?
While getting my snacks sorted out I was informed that some portion of the daily allotment of taco fillings had been exhausted and I'd have to try something else, like maybe tempura chicken tenders and mexican street corn salad? OK, close enough. 
Tenders were warm and moist and tender, batter was light and airy but had softened somewhat by the time I got into them and they come with an interesting little pot of dipping sauce. Street corn is an interesting ensemble of corns, peppers, onions, and stuff in a light cream sauce, tasted okay and played well with the chickens so that's good enough for now. Will try again when I am in better spirits and not so enraged by the road."}
{"text":"Possibly the 1st person to eat here twice! 

1st visit: dine in. Ordered the brisket plate with collards & Brunswick stew 

Bf ordered ribeye  with black bean soup & Mexican corn  salad.

Brisket is amazing & I would know bc I'm from Texas. Nice & crispy carmelization on the outside & perfect balance of fatty/ lean on the inside.

Brunswick stew had good flavor but not much to it.

Black bean soup was good. 

Collards good but on the sweeter side, I prefer spicy. 

Mexican corn salad was more creamy than expected.

Ribeye was the most tender steak I have ever had and cooked just as ordered. 

Lunch the next day I ordered the Big Blue salad which was delicious but the price point compared to the salads including protein doesn't make sense. 

Overall pretty good, kinda pricey. I would return for the brisket."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant, but the setup is weird. You have to stand inline to order. The ordering process is so slow. You still have to wait for your food once you order. Standing inline for 20mins with 2 kiddos just doesn't fit our dining still at the moment. Right now this isn't a family place. No coloring papers or printed kids menu. We will try again in 2 months maybe they will have figured out the kinks."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time -we had a great experience with service and the food was amazing. We had the beef brisket and think it's the best we've had in a long time. Atmosphere was nice and a good combination of easy, casual and fun. So happy to have this in our neighborhood. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"We were curious to check out Cowboy and were told that the style of dining was very casual.  However, it is not a burger place.  There are steaks, and my friend got a great cut of filet for just 17.00.  The rotisserie chicken tacos I ordered were dry and small.  Sides were pretty good, baked beans, salad, and string fries.  You get your own beverages and there is a small bar.  Family style dining where you order your food and then sit at picnic tables for delivery.  The wait staff was very nice.  Overall the ambiance is good, a fire pit outside and mod decor and lighting, but I'd probably go back for lunch only."}
{"text":"Cowboy is a different and interesting concept for a \"steak\" restaurant.  You order your food at the front with their very apt staff and sit down with a number to have your food delivered to you.  Ours was delivered very quickly.

We opted to sit outside on this bright spring day, under broad umbrellas on sturdy benches and tables.  I noticed a firepit that was lit and surrounded by chairs for drinking and chatting.  There are also cornhole boards out here.

Our food was mostly good.  The macaroni and cheese was really creamy and delicious.  The chicken tenders were breaded nicely and somewhat crispy, you could tell they were made in house.  My brisket tacos were a little disappointing, being somewhat plain and cold.  I loved the sides I ordered: Barbecue beans and Brunswick stew.

I would definitely give this spot another try.  It is new and inventive with a solid menu that deserves exploration."}
{"text":"I am extremely pleased with the experience I had at Cowboy  from the moment I walked in, I didn't once wonder where I should look or what I should do (although the aromas may have guided me.) 

Friendly staff greeted me as soon as I walked in, handed me a menu, and directed me to stand in the (long) line. It's new and trendy, so the wait didn't bother me. We all wanted to try it! 

I really liked watching the kitchen staff prepare food; I was at ease seeing their excellent technique and attention to cleanliness. Not only that, but the rotisserie chickens roasting over the flame wasn't a bad sight in preparation for my meal! (Picture juicy, golden browned chicken. Yes. Sir.) 

The seating can be family style (sit with others) or sit on your own. You order your food at the register then bring out the pager to the table you're at. Kind and attentive wait staff check in frequently to see if you need refills, flatware, etc. Much appreciated. 

I ordered brisket tacos (asked for lean meat) with black bean soup and mac and cheese. 

I am a die-hard flour tortilla fan, but I think Cowboy may have converted me to corn-tortillaism. Theirs are thick and hearty but not gritty-excellent flavor and texture! Maybe it's a corn tortilla hybrid? Whatever it is, I'm a-maize-ed. The brisket and slaw and pickled onions with whatever the sauce was had me over the moon. Juicy and flavorful-undoubtedly tantalizing my taste buds. 

The black bean soup was everything I never knew I needed. It was spicy but balanced by the dollop of sour cream in the middle. Excellent balance of flavors. Great portion, too. 

I also ordered the mac which I didn't care for. While I applaud the flavor of the sauce, there was entirely too much of it (I know; is that even a thing?) But, unfortunately, the noodles were overdone and mooshy. I don't care for noodles that are over cooked, especially macaroni noodles. I think it has potential! It also might be my preference...

What really stood out to me this visit apart from the food was the excellent customer service I was shown. My order had a mistake once it arrived, and they must have fixed it on the fly because it was resolved in 5 minutes or less. On top of the quick turnaround on that mistake, the manager, Cassie, made sure that we were completely satisfied with our service that night. She hit a home run with customer service. 

So, I'll be back because those brisket tacos are dream worthy, but also because a restaurant with a staff that has customer service like that deserves my patronage. 

Thank you for the experience! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"First time there my ribeye was mostly fat, mac and cheese was cold and the collards were good but had a lot of vinegar on them. My husband had the bbq brisket tacos and there was basically no meat in them an the meat was cold. $35.00 later will not go back."}
{"text":"Last night I dined and tried the chicken sandwich (grilled). The bread was very overpowering to the rest of the sandwich yet had no flavor at the same time. It was equivalent to biting into a piece of cardboard. The fries and selection of barbecue sauces were good-very filling. Staff was friendly and always showed they were available to help."}
{"text":"High priced McDonald's. They own 131 main. Spend a little extra and go there. $18 for a 10oz ribeye steak wholly shut your mouth!"}
{"text":"Food is good and tasty. Staff was friendly. A little on the pricey side for what it is and how it's set up. The setup was our biggest dislike. Wait in line, order at the counter, try to find your own table otherwise your sharing a large table with strangers. Can beer wasn't very cold as it is just kept in a ice chest that gets restocked straight from room temp beer cases underneath it."}
{"text":"Definitely A-OK on first visit but very clear they've got some things to work out as the opening kinks are learned and fixed.  Any place should be able to figure out the logistical things but if the food isn't any good then none of that will matter.  Good news for Cowboy is that the food is good.  At least it was on our visit 5 days after opening.

My wife had the grilled chicken tacos with a side of Mexican street corn while I had the 8 oz. filet with french fries and coleslaw.  Every side was outstanding.  The fries were hot and crisp, the corn was just the right amount of flavor and spice and the coleslaw was an absolutely perfect blend of mayo, celery seed, vinegar, etc.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  The tacos were good and really spicy if you chose not to remove the pickled jalapenos and add the spicy habenero bbq sauce like we did.  The filet was huge, lean and just a wee bit closer to medium than the medium rare I ordered.  Flavor was good with a char from the live wood fire.

What needs work is the entire ordering and payment process, getting a handle on how much food they need on a given day to feed the masses (We arrived at 5:30 and they were already out of rotisserie chicken and brisket), and how to handle the line when it's out the door and close to around the building.  We watched that line get moved inside along the glass windows and alongside the tables that lined that window.  If I was sitting at one of those tables I would have been annoyed at having this line of people hovering over my table as I ate.

Work to do but this ownership groups knows their stuff so I figure things will settle in relatively soon.  Once they get it all together I would love to see a couple burgers on the menu.  Just thinking about how good they would be cooked on that wood-fired grill makes me a happy scrappy hero pup!"}
{"text":"I don't mind the counter service or even standing in the line. As I was watching them slice the bbq to order, and thw smell of warm bread in thw air, I was getting excited. It stopped there. We ordered chicken tenders w fries, and a ribeye medium cook with salad and fries l, and pecan pie to share. When our order was set down, we immediately went for the fries because the employees had talked then up the entire time we were in line (out the door). Ice cold. I immediately flagged down a food runner and asked for fresh fries bx these were inedible they were so cold. He brought one order out, even though we had two, but no-one apologized. They were really good hot though. The tempura on the chicken tenders fell off the chicken, not in a food crunchy way though. It was so soggy like wet dough falling off. I assumed theybwoild make tempura chicken tenders fresh to order, but I was wrong. He had a pile of soggy dough on his plate. Now the \"ribeye\". After I ordered I noticed theybwere pulling a beautifully medium prime rib out of the warming cabinet. I immediately thought \"I didn't see prime rib, I would've ordered that\", but watches him lay it on the grill and then wondered how it was going to be mediu. Like that. The steak had beautiful color on the outside but it was medium well on the inside. How dare you guys ruin steak like that. I've read other reviews mentioning they don't know how to cook a steak, but I didn't listen because they own 131 Main....the steak was terrible over cooked. The flavor wanted to be there and the maebling was perfect. You can't take a medium prime rib and out it on the grill. Just sell a smoked prime rib, I would've been all over that. Seriously, it would've been perfect right out of the warming cabinet. The pecan pie was seriously too sweet and I love pecan pie. Unless you want sugar pie, don't order it, you may need some insulin. I can forgive the pie (personal preferences) and tgey shoild know better than to hold fries too long but the steak was too expensive too over cook, way over cook. Once again, you can't put medium over fire and expect it to stay medium. I had such high hopes. We need a solid bbq place. I don't mind spending the money if the quality is there.    I'm disappointed and can only hope their bbq is better. First impression wasn't good. I'm not going to get my husband to go back in a second time...."}
{"text":"The food was good but the concept was terrible. I would much rather sit at a table, order my food, and relax while waiting on my food. Taking one order at a time for a Restutant full of people ???? It just doesn't make sense. Even in fast food restaurants there are usually 2 or 3 people taking orders at a time. I feel if they would change this concept to ordering from the table, that it would have a much better chance at being successful. We have eaten there twice already, but would probably only order take out from now on if it stays the way it is."}
{"text":"We went here when they first opened and although it was \"decent food\" I wouldn't have said it was great food. The first time I went I got the brisket taco, it was rather small and the brisket was fatty. The coleslaw was amazing and so was the atmosphere. Some friends wanted to go here one night, so I figured I would give it another shot. I once again got the brisket taco. Boy was I surprised, plenty of brisket (not fatty at all and perfectly seasoned) much larger portions. I did try the Mac n cheese and it was great as well. If you went when they first opened I would highly recommend trying it again, every restaurant goes through that phase. The atmosphere here is very fun, and plenty of seating outside."}
{"text":"Great place, great food.  The one rib that comes with the Rib order is enough to feed an Army and was perfectly seasoned and tender."}
