{"text":"This place is one of a kind ! Mariscos & sushi all in one place ? Heaven! I highly recommend anyone who loves seafood in general to visit this place. Cheerz!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out with my boyfriend, but it was not what we expected, he ordered the molcajete, it was super small for the price , you don't get your money's worth , food quality was alright , yeah we're never going b"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all plus it's located in a shity part of town filled with meth heads and it wasn't that long ago somebody got stabbed at this place. To be honest the only reason i really used to go was because there was this waitress i was trying to get at who I thought was cute but then one day i seen her with no makeup and i was like wtf! So now i will never be going back."}
{"text":"Genial para llevar a tu novia o alguna persona que acabas de conocer..... Ya que compre en dos ocaciones un platillo de $22 y otro de $20 y el plato solo tenia literariamente 6 camarones, mucha cebolla y pepino pero de camarones solo 6.... El servicio es malisimo.... Fui al bano para labarme las manos y espere 15 minutos..... Estaba un empleado en el bano hablando por el celular.... Disculpen la falta de ortografia...."}
{"text":"Antes estaba mas bueno y la porciones mas grandes y ahora valen verga con esta comida que hasta animales le salieron a mi hermano..."}
{"text":"Everything is really good..my to go plate is mariscos mi lindo sinaloa plate...the best part is la salsa negra which gives the perfect flavor to my mariscos..micheladas are alright. The sushis are good my favorite is the 3 quesos."}
{"text":"Well I dint like my roll don't like the Philadelphia on sushi  and they dint even gave me the miso soup  plus is not true that the roll are 9.99 each is a lie."}
{"text":"Strongly recommend!!!  Went there yesterday!! Great service!! Our waitress Minerva was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service. I really love the sushi here but just wish they didn't have music at all. Everyone has different preferences."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious I love everything about it but the service sucks. The server sat us down at a dirty table and then forgot about us. And then the new server brought my bf the wrong drink and wasn't sure about the menu."}
{"text":"Always bomb sushi and this trip was no different  we were high as a kite when we started our journey of mexican sushi and micheladas every dish was spectacular the service was good not the best but that all changed when i gave the waitress a fat blunt to calm her nerves. From then on we were kings bottles got broken out like we were mexican diplomats what an amazing night im sure there still talking about us."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. I was looking for a SUSHI place. Not a mixture of Mexican and sushi. First of all I'm not Hispanic and they just start talking to me in Spanish. Then I say I only speak English and she puts down a Spanish menu. I told her I would like a shrimp cocktail. At first I was saying guacamole then I said No nevermind id rather just have the shrimp cocktail. It looks like soup. No shrimp hanging off the top or anything. And then she brings me the biggest guacamole bowl they possibly have. No regard as to what I said. I am actually appalled and very disappointed. DO NOT COME HERE. It is not what you think"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came from the bay area in California to vacation in Vegas over the summer. My family is from Culiacan and sushi estilo Sinaloense is the best. You definitely get that here! The employees are nice! The food is delicious. I would recommend this to any friend visiting Vegas! I would say the only downfall is the lady that comes to sing lol! I respect her hustle though!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Loved this mexican style sushi  was delicious. I got the what happens in Vegas roll it was great. Music was nice. Loved it."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times! But always take out! The Mexican seafood sushi concept is great! I've tried 3-4 different rolls and they are REALLY GOOD. Also their seafood and shrimp cocktails are very good something different from other Mexican seafood places here in Vegas! The orders are very generous too with lots of meat! The staff is always nice and friendly. The times I've been here to pick up food it always seems nice not very crazy packed like other seafood restaurants here in town. Definitely going back Over and over again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best sushi and seafood I ever had, great variety and the best sushi."}
{"text":"Honestly... not what I expected from a Mexican sushi place. I will say I was pleasantly surprised. Their sushi is mostly cooked and very little selection in the raw sushi. However, their usual Mexican seafood selection is amazing. In addition, their micheladas are to die for. Rich in flavor and very well prepared. Their customer service complements their food in all aspects. All the waitresses were attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend  brother wanted to try this place out. I never trust mexican sushi.  But out of respect  for my friend and his family I didnt say anything.  I regret it because now I am in the ER with food poisoning . My friend  sister had bad cramp and diarrhea. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only place in Vegas that has Sinaloense style sushi ....I am a huge sushi fan so i know good sushi!!! They also have mariscos which makes them have a variety because not every1 one likes sushi. I really enjoyed the shrimp with cream cheese inside deep fried. The only thing that was not to good was the soy sauce they prepared, it was extremely diluted. Other then that the service was exceptional, and everything was served at a timely manner. The place is also keep very clean, which is a huge plus!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of sushi, I really am. I've tried many places, all traditional (Philadelphia roll, California roll, etc.), but this was the first place I tried that was a sushi fusion place. The concept is interesting: Mexican sushi, who would've thought? They pull it off well! Every roll is new to me and has something different to offer. Some are made with beef and chicken, some have cheese on them, and they're all at least worth a try. They're nicely presented, too, because everyone knows you begin eating with your eyes. The place itself is simple: booths and tables, banda music playing through the speakers, and attentive servers. Mexican restaurants aren't known for ostentatious decoration, they're there to give you good food. The food speaks volumes for itself."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town! Customer service was great and the food was better than expected. Definitely an awesome place to check out."}
{"text":"I had the oysters with ceviche and let me tell you they are . Defiantly coming again!"}
{"text":"Awesome cooked sushi, full of flavor and you don't feel heavy/gross afterwards. They make their own soy sauce and the service is great. Check it out, only Mex sushi place in town I know of."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for sushi!! Plus they also have mariscos so it's a  plus plus. great food and service soo we will most def be back."}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine recommended this place so a few of us came to try this place after work. The place was empty when we first walked in, very nice and clean, they have booths against the walls and tables in the middle, good for large parties.   This is Mexican style sushi...pretty much sushi rolls with different types of meats and sauces. First of the rolls were very big, the three of us shared 4 rolls and one appetizer and we were stuffed, definitely not like Japanese sushi where the rolls are on the thinner side.   They have both Spanish and English menu, unfortunately I didn't ask for the English menu until after my co-worker ordered so I don't know the names of any of the dishes we ordered, I pretty much pointed out which one looked good and went with it.   So they have salty and sweet sushi. The salty sushi rolls are typical shrimp tempura, crab, beef and chicken. The sweet rolls have fruits such as mango, kiwi and strawberry on top. I definitely prefer the salty rolls, the sweet rolls were not bad but maybe have those for dessert? It was strange eating a mix of sweet and salty for lunch.   They also have oysters, shrimp ceviche and cocktails. One of my co-workers go the shrimp cocktail and said it was very good. I got the Jamaica juice and that was refreshing and delicious, not too sweet. My co-workers got horchata and said that the horchata is very good compared to other places, so definitely check out their drinks.   My first experience was pretty good, I would have to go back and try other dishes to give a better rating if all goes well, I liked it but was not impressed. In their defense I was with co-workers that were a little picky with their food so we stuck to the basic shrimp tempura and crab rolls, I couldn't try the more unique rolls. But there is always next time!"}
{"text":"Disgusting Bad service Roll was falling apart  There was only 2 tables with people and it took long time just to bring the beverages and food i dont recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Sushi made different very interesting taste but delicious . they have this sauce they make there very delicious with the sushi , the seviche is good but they're known beter for the sushi highly recommend"}
{"text":"this place is right down the street from me and I love sushi, so I was super excited to try it when they open up.i got take out with them a while back, they have a 2 for $15 thing so I got that. first thing that was frustrating was the whole menu is in all spanish, not English and spanish, just spanish. I can't read it!! so I didn't know what was in all the rolls. I asked the waitress who was super nice she kinda explained. but I couldn't hold her up and ask her what every little thing is. I decided to take a chance, throw caution to the wind and try somethin new. I got the 2 rolls for 15 bucks, it was a great price, they looked good in the pic and it was somethin new. ittttttt was totally gross and I ended up throwing it away. it was like steak and cheese and some imatatio crab mix with 2 sauces on the side. one that looked like spicy mayo but tasted like thousand island and one that looked like eel sauce but tasted like vinegar. I just didn't like any of it, neither did my dad or husband as I tried to give it to them before throwing it away. now had I actually been able to read the menu without feeling like a nuisance having to ask the server I probably wou ok d have ordered something I liked. some of the pics looked bomb.its also Hella expensive. I mean I can go to sakana or Yama or sushi way and get all you can eat off of a menu I can read for 25 bucks. here some of the rolls are 15 just for one.im sorry to say that I won't go back to this place, there's too many other places to choose from. I wanted to love this place cuz it's so close to me, but it just didn't work out that way. :("}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointed :/ the sushi is a no go from here. We ordered a couple rolls and they all look and taste like 711 sushi. Yes even the sushi bought at Smith's is better than this. If you want bland over priced gas station sushi well then you found the right place!! Also super stingy with ingredients."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant. Actually found it by pure coincidence food and drinks were good and the prices were decent. Service was great the waitress were really nice one thing was just they took a little too long to bring out our order that includes the drink. Other than that the place was clean and welcoming good music and they have plenty of tvs to get entertain if u like watching soccer games. Overall I will bring my family back hoping they get faster at bringing out the food"}
{"text":"First in foremost this is not a sushi restaurant what so ever. I had a a roll the name was in Spanish so I do not remember it I apologize. It was suppose to shrimp tempura in the middle with a spicy sauce and salmon on the outside. The salmon was an absolute disaster and the shrimp tempura was just cold raw shrimp inside. It was nothing like the description. The service was not all that great with only a few tables seated.  My wife had some kinda of Mexican shrimp cocktail that she said was so so. The best part of the meal was the guacamole which was absolutely delicious I really enjoyed it. I will never go back there again and if you are looking for sushi please yourself a favor and don't choose this place and to end on a positive not the place was extremely clean."}
{"text":"Let me just say first, that I am a sushi fanatic. I eat sushi once a week and probably have tried the majority of most popular sushi spots in Vegas and I love Mexican seafood so why not try it? The staff was friendly and they even have a button to push at your table if you need the waitress at any time. I ordered a michelada which was delicious but the sushi however tasted old and the fish was sliced sooo thin. I give the sushi a 2/5 stars. I've heard the seafood is better than the sushi there so I might go back to try that only because I live closely. If you're going for sushi however, or live far, don't waste your time. I paid $25 for one sushi roll and a drink. That's the price of all you can eat dinner at a normal sushi spot."}
{"text":"To $$$, better off going to a ALL YOU CAN EAT, never going there! The service is good but, prices are yo much. There's better places out there then this one"}
{"text":"Came here because I was very curious about the restaurant. I tried the sushi but not the mariscos so I cannot say anything about that. We were seated fast. Place was pretty empty for being a Friday night \"which shoulda been a warning\".. The sushi is WAY over priced in my opinion, and has almost no flavor. The presentation is great it looks very nice, but it does not taste as good as it looks. The rolls are topped with a lot of unnecessary stuff like imitation crab and extra shrimp which is not needed. I would not recommend it if you are coming here to eat sushi. Stick to a real sushi place. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to dine this is not the place the staff are not that nice and most of the time I felt rushed to order and they were in the back doing god knows what. the food was okay not really what I expected for a sushi place but oh well not a place I'll be going to any time soon"}
{"text":"Really good place and a nice different spin on sushi. We got cooked sushi because the menus are not in English, but it was good. Not my favorite style of sushi because I like raw sushi but it wasn't too bad and I'm sure they have raw also."}
{"text":"This could be the start of a good joke but it's not... Two gringos walk into a Mexican restaurant and......  I work at a clinic in the area and wanted to try something close by after work with a friend. The front desk person suggested this place so I thought I'd give it a try. Who doesn't like Mexican food and sushi?   Walking in we were welcomed and seated right away. Once seated I started looking over the menu. Of course the first thing I look at are the pictures.... When I decided to start reading the menu I was lost... IT WAS ALL IN SPANISH, ahhhhhh! The waitress hadn't come by yet so I had to quickly text a friend to describe the rolls to me, but it was taking too long for her to get back and so I decided to order by what name sounded best... I decided to order the la lomita roll.   Wait time was a bit long as it looked like they were short staffed and busy but it was well worth the wait. When the roll came out it was bigger than I expected and tasted delicious.   This review was based off of one roll but it was a good roll. I'll definitely be going back but I'm going to bring someone who speaks/reads Spanish with me."}
{"text":"The Sushi was Good Specially the house soy sauce had the mexican flavor iwas looking for 1 Roll.Fills you up"}
{"text":"Great taste, good service. I eat here regularly."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing!!!! I highly recommend!! I always make sure to come and eat here every time I am in Las Vegas. The prices are really great and the food is even better! My favorite hands down is the Mango Caliente."}
{"text":"Really high prices for the quality food. \"La Chica Fresa\" was so disgusting and after telling the waitress it was not good at all and leaving the entire plate untouched minus a bite, the waitress still charged it and didn't really care to make it better. Completely over priced for food that is all fried."}
{"text":"Came here once for my birthday & they made me a special happy birthday plate. It was delicious stuffed peppers with crab & shrimp."}
{"text":"This is our first time here we traveled all the way from Arizona to try it. And we were definitely not disappointed great food great service we will be back thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic culichi food then this is your spot. Their sushi and mariscos are very delicious. Their food tastes just like the food you get in Culiacan.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I strongly recommend this place! Arriva Culichi!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Would I go back ? NO! Looks like they invested quite some money in this place , therefore I hope changes are made. For me , Next time I'll either go to a better seafood restaurant , or a American sushi place...as I stated before , nothing special about this place ."}
{"text":"First time here, we were sat right away. The button on the side of the napkin dispenser is critical if you want service after you sit down. They don't have AYCE sushi so don't ask, everything is ala carte. The rolls tasted good, flavor was very good, the shrimp cocktail tasted well.  Just don't forget the BUTTON on the side of the napkin dispenser."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever. Wife and I decided to try it out but it was a waste of our time and more our money. Doesn't even feel like your having sushi. I ordered my daughter some chicken nuggets and fries and I ate that instead"}
{"text":"I've came to this place a few times already and I've loved it each time. I highly recommend it to everyone! El sushi es estilo Sinaloa, el sabor es muy parecido al de México. Me gusta mucho el roll mango caliente. Los mariscos también están muy rico. Y los empleados también son muy amables."}
{"text":"Sushi was good but too loud and crowded.  There was plenty of empty seats on the other side of the restaurant but they sat everyone on one side and practically on top of each other.  Not sure if I'll return because I enjoy my space while eating and the ability to hear my family while we're halving conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"They didn't take my drink order. I had to tell her to bring it. Micheladas are watered down. They need a bigger selection of seafood and sushi. They don't have chips and salsa either. The customer service is not up to par they don't check up on you at all. the sushi was the only good thing, but I will not come back here. they had issues splitting our bills too it was a big deal!"}
{"text":"If you've never tried Mexican sushi before then you must and this is the place to do it.   I heard about a chain in LA doing mexican sushi and it sounded good so I looked for something similar in Las Vegas and I'm so glad I found it.  It was awesome and a must try for anyone looking for something different."}
{"text":"I wasn't real sure what to expect,  but the food was excellent.  It's not your typical sushi. It's very different, with a Mexican twist. We really enjoyed our visit and next time we are in the area will stop by."}
{"text":"Food was great overall. Really tasty and loved spiciness of the different rolls we ordered. My only complain with this resturant is it took forever to take order. Was sitting at table for a good 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us and I had to get up and let them know \"hey we are ready to order.\" Then the waitress proceeded to say oh there's a button you can press to call us. Ummm no one said anything about a button and it was hidden behind all the different hot sauses. Also don't come hungry because they take fooooooreeeevvvvvver to bring out your order."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing lol. Hands down all I can say.  I did buy from their sushi section and was astonished by the flavor and portion size!  I would recommend checking this spot out!"}
{"text":"I just came in on Valentine's Day with my husband and daughter and asked for a booth , there were four open booths with couples on them and the male hostess said we could not have a booth because the owner said he's saving them for five or more ."}
{"text":"everything was so delicious ! the sushi is exactly how I remember it when I had it in Sinaloa. not your  raw fish - typical American sushi. Very flavorful and the sea food they have like oysters and ceviche were AMAZING ! I highly suggest the Altata oysters were my favorite thing here. will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Different and good customer service. We had some sushi rolls and they were amazing also the tostadas were huge and delicious."}
{"text":"I have too much love for sushi. And this made my heart and wallet hurt. For the amount I paid I could of had a wonderful AYCE at the strip. The rolls were not good, tasteless, and even adding lime and sriracha did not make the roll taste good. I was left with a horrible taste in my mouth after tasting three rolls. Please leave the sushi rolls to the Japanese."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and just to start off, if your looking for traditional sushi, I'd go somewhere else. Only reason why I come back is because I understand the fusion aspect of the concept of Mexican sushi and I personally think it pairs great with mexican style\"mojarra\" seafood. The rolls are great, more so on the spicy side, but the ceviches and the Cheladas are great. It's a fun place, they have service buttons to get ahold of your server if you need something and they're pretty attentive. Not too pricey and a great place to have fun and booths and tables big enough for parties"}
{"text":"When you walk in immediately you are greeted. The music is beautiful Mexican voices.  The waitresses were very friendly in helping you order. The food was delicious!!! The restaurant was clean, with plenty of open seats available. The fish tasted gamey, not very fresh. Service was slow once you sat down, Guac was good."}
{"text":"Good food, the service not so much. We were the only non-Spanish speaking people in the restaurant and it took us a while to get any service. It was our first time their and we definitely felt like outsiders. Too bad, we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wow after trying Yama sushi this place is meh. Salmon tastes old. Tempura roll is bland. Prices don't reflect the food. The sauces try to cover up the fact that the food doesn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"I seen this place at the corner of my eye to notice something different on the east side!  Looked them up on Yelp, seen a few pictures, read some reviews, and I figured that I just had to try it myself.  It's basically Mexican style sushi. The concept in my opinion is great! And for me, the food was too!  I went in for take out, and to my surprise I happened to know the hostess! So my experience here went very well!  I tried my rolls as soon they were ready and I loved them! So if someone dined here and had a tasteless meal, I don't see it happening. I'd assume maybe you just ordered something that wasn't what you'd order to begin with. I'd recommend asking your waitress for help around the menu (I did too, it's always good to get their recommendations). Although, the downfall to their menu was it being in all Spanish. I don't see how that will work for people who can't speak the language. Hopefully they can fix that for everybody else to be able to order easily without bugging the employees so much with questions.  Also, they have a variety of yummy hot sauces and salsas to pair with any food. Which they were also available to buy and I definitely did take some home with me! (:  Can't go wrong!  I'm excited to bring my mom and grandma here!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Second time coming here. Sushi was really good. I had the el pariente roll. It has bacon and meat. They do t have beer yet. Waitress said they are working on. Over all the decor is nice black and red. Music is a little too loud but it not horrible. They have buttons on the napkin holders. I live Sushi and it nice to see something different. Overall good job."}
