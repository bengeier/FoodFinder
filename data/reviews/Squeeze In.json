{"text":"I took yelps advice and it didnt do me wrong . When i arrived i was greeted by some very friendly staff. I felt very welcomed. Means alot when your traveling alone. First thing i noticed about this place was the cute decor different but i liked it. Especially the use of different kind of chairs. They gave me time to figure out what i wanted and made great suggestions. I ordered food was good and i was full. Only thing that wasnt my favorite was the water but i think thats a city problem . I checked in with yelp to get a free mimosa. Mmmmm. Kinda strong but they dont play in Vegas. My bill was very affordable. The mananger was even nice enough to seat down and give me suggestions on what i can do here. Very nice and sweet of him. Go check them out."}
{"text":"Hands down great service and great food as well. The food portions are more than enough, so I'd advise anyone to not eat with their eyes. You come here, guaranteed you'd be pleased. Wide variety of food choices. Great place for either breakfast or lunch.  Andrew was very attentive to my wife and I. I'll recommend this place to anyone. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"AC out 93 degrees inside just think you should inform people so the can decide if they want to eat in those conditions not pretty much condem them to those conditions . Doesn't make it seem customer focused just want to keep the money coming in. Its a shame because it seems like an ok place. Hoped for a better experience family in town but what can you do"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me a year to find this gem.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and Squeeze In is the best I've found in Las Vegas. Great food and top-notch service!"}
{"text":"Visited this place today for the first time. After seeing the average star rating, we thought it has to be good! Well, our server was great but that's about all that was. Food is less than average. Everything we ordered was either burnt or under cooked. Our server apologized and took off my daughters meal, being she barely touched it and offered us a $10 off coupon for our next visit. Still, our bill of $61, plus a $10 tip, for less than mediocre food was disappointing. Don't just look at the star ratings, take the time to read the comments about the food."}
{"text":"I had an amazing breakfast.  I had the racy omelette with English muffin and chocolate bacon.. OK mg, it was SO darn good. Will def. Comeback Soon!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place because of the Yelp reviews, and I must say I was disappointed.  First of all, we opened the menu and were surprised by how expensive it was.  I normally don't expect to spend $15 for an omelette in a place that is located in a suburban strip mall where the basic decoration is shabby chic and graffiti.   We ordered pancakes and french toast, which were okay, but not remarkable.  We had two different people aggressively try to sell us on their loyalty program. Our server gave us the hard sell in the middle of our meal.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is rated so high. We came to try it out today and we will not be returning. Wait was about 20 minutes to be seated, then we waited over an hour before we got our food. Service was poor and disorganized. Other people's orders around us were getting messed up. When we finally did get our food, we didnt get our toast. After asking twice, it finally came...with our check and to-go box. Food was bland, although large portions but very overpriced. Only positive of our experience today were the potatoes and finally getting out of there 2 hours later."}
{"text":"The food and employees are everything here! Delicious drinks! Amazing food (and quite a bit of the menu can be made gluten free)! We come here frequently and never tire of it. Thanks Squeeze In!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service, would fix a couple small things but overall if back in vegas I would definitely go again ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!  A must try.  It will be your fav too.  Our server Andrew is the best!  The omelettes are out of this world!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately which was great even though they looked pack. Forty-five minutes later and on our 3rd cup coffee at the moment, the food is \"almost ready\". More to come."}
{"text":"My mom, sister, and I recently discovered Squeeze In! My sister is vegan and I am vegetarian so it can be hard to find places with a variety of options for us but this place has lots of options for healthy eaters, vegans, and vegetarians. We have had Andrew as our server a couple times now and he has always been fantastic! He was very patient with all of our dietary needs- I got the Garth Breakfast Sandwhich and he offered to substitute a veggie pattie as my choice of \"meat.\" You can also write your name, favorite quote, etc on the walls there, which  makes it fun and interactive for guests. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We finally tried it, and it's not bad.  It's always crowded in the weekend.  The omelettes were pretty big and loaded.  The staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be back and try other items on menu."}
{"text":"Possibly the best breakfast place I've ever had. My wife order 2 separate plates, we could have shared, it was that much food"}
{"text":"We were very excited to take our in laws here while they visited this past weekend.  The ladies were all friendly and helpful.  The food wasn't horrible. My husbands omelet was great! I got the eggs Benedict and it seemed like it sat for a while. The English muffin was so soggy it was beyond edible and the potatoes were crusty and old. I was very disappointed in my meal, but everyone else in my party was happy.  When the check came we almost pooped our pants. $78 for 4 meals.  We would expect an expensive meal eating out on the strip but not at a place like this. Upon further reading of the check we realized all the up charges that add up quickly. For instance, When ordering we were asked if we wanted plain potatoes or cheesy potatoes. We all got cheesy without realizing it was an additional $3 per plate.  Bottom line for me, this place isn't worth it. The food doesn't make the outrageous prices worth it. I can make the same food taste better in my own kitchen for half the cost."}
{"text":"Checking this place out from a Groupon deal. Very Kool and Very Different the minute you walk in with the Alien Decor and the wild colors.. Highly recomend everuone make a visit. Food is Amazing and hay pretty famous dish's are featured!! A little fun fact."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and food was sub par. Tables were dirty, unsanitary.   Many other better options in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great! Feels like home when you walk in! All staff are friendly and eager to please! The food is well priced and great portion sizes! The Bloody Mary's are awesome! A must go place for a great breakfast! Don't forget to write something fun on the walls!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary we've had since moving to Las Vegas. The potatoes with carmelized onions and cheese are amazing. Great service, too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a very good first impression.  Had wanted to check out this place after seeing the eclectic omelette selection. Probably the best thing was that they were able to seat us right away despite the crowd still being busy on a Sunday morning (around 1130ish). We got drinks right away, but when we tried to place our order, the person said she would notify our server.  Ok, fine.  Only our server never showed up.  When the server to the table next to us started taking their order (and they arrived well after us), I got out of my chair to ask where our server was.  And apparently it was the server at the other table. So that didn't leave a great first impression.  Our order was promptly taken after I raised a stink.   I decided on the patty melt with upgraded garlic fries and my wife had the special chipotle shrimp tacos.  In hindsight, we probably should've tried out more traditional breakfast fare, but neither of us were feeling like their breakfast items that day.  While the patty melt burger was good, the garlic fries were not edible at all.  It's like they took a fresh batch of shoestring fries and dumped some kind of garlic concoction on it.  Super disappointed and so I would not recommend the garlic fries at all.  The 3 chipotle tacos were very oily, little shrimp and the salsa that they had available hardly qualified as salsa (tasted more like a marinara sauce than a decent Mexican salsa).  Cannot recommend those either.  But the kicker is that all of these very unsatisfying food dishes were very expensive.  Do not expect to find any value priced breakfast food items here.  Patty melt was almost $13 (with the garlic fry upgrade) and the tacos were $13 as well.  I can overlook some food flaws if the price is right.  But at these prices, the good had better be amazing...and it simply wasn't.  I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"We went to this place on 11/13/16 to try this place out because our friends said that it had the best breakfast and burgers(which is my daughters fav) Well we got there it was kinda busy they told us about 10-15 mins till we sat down to eat, we were seated within that time frame which so far was good,starting off to a good start. Our serve was awesome no problems there. The problem came when we ordered our food we all order something different between breakfast to lunch options. We were waiting for about 30-45 mins after we ordered and no food yet then i seen at food window my dish and my daughters dish sitting at the window while a server(not ours) just standing there staring at the food and i was like or are you going to bring that to us or not and it sat in the window for a good 15 mins before being served to us and then we had to wait for my husbands biscuits and gravy to come out and then our server came over to let my husband know that the oven went out about 45 mins ago so couldn't make the biscuits and gravy (why wasn't this told 45 mins ago that way he could order something else) my husband was angry so he went to wait in the car for us while i tried to eat my pancakes and eggs and bacon it was cold and gross and my daughters burger was cold as well. we didn't eat the food at all we had to go up to the counter to get our check and the lady asked if we enjoyed everything and i completely went off on her about our horrible visit there, she stated we didn't have to pay the check, i did give our serve a tip just cause he was on top off everything else. I really wouldn't recommend this place i know oven stop working all the time but need more communication with staff and customers and also don't let food sit on a counter for other food to come out for that table so it gets cold."}
{"text":"Good food.  Huge menu!  My son (4) and I are on a mission to try all the restaurants in a 1 mile radius of our home and so far this is one of our favs."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Bad service. Took forever to take our order, looks like they are short of staff and disorganized.  4/2/17--second chance  I came back here and this time I brought my whole family so there were 8 of us. I love their food so came back for a second chance and it seems like they have not improve their service yet.  First of all, I asked for one of the order to go and requested to get it out first as soon as they can and it was the very last one to served! Second, made a mistake on my order so I had to wait longer on my food. Third, they messed up on my mother's order!. 3 strike!! Too bad because I really love their food but we were disappointed once again with the service."}
{"text":"Amazing Service and very friendly too. The food was really good too, a bit pricey but still enjoyed the environment and the food. I would highly recommend as a place for special occasions. The menu has some unique items that I will definitely try next time."}
{"text":"Very slow service. The place was very busy but I saw our food sitting on the counter for over 7 minutes, waiting to be served to us. I don't think I would come back, again."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Fresh ingredients and large portions for a reasonable price. My new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"My chef friend Kamakani wanted to check this place out and I'm so glad he did!! Amy, our server has the best sense of humor and I love her Mimosas!! They are the tastiest mimosas I've ever enjoyed!!  I ordered the Veggie Vigor and their claims to having the best omlettes is point on!! I've had vegetarian omlettes before and I've never had a good opinion of them until now!! Very flavorful and I had the biscuits and gravy with them which took the experience to a higher level!! Their biscuits are fluffy and huge and the gravy was just the right amount of creamy, salty, sausagie, and was the perfect accompaniment to the Veggie Vigor omelette!!  Squeeze In also started a new mimosa flight where they feature 3 different flavors of mimosa in cute, tiny, taster glasses! You need to try that out soon!! The only thing I would like to see is pineapple juice and pineapple mimosas. All in all, 2 thumbs up and I'm going back for more! I like this place so much( thank you Amy for the fun experience!) I want to explore the menu thoroughly!! They'll be seeing more of me soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST if you are in Vegas! It's about a 15-20 min drive from the strip, but WAY worth it.  The menu is impressive! So many good options..it's sure to please everyone in your party.  They serve mimosas and other breakfast drinks.  Staff was friendly.  We had an eric breakfast burrito and it was bomb. The servings are large.  The omelets looked amazing. We've eaten breakfast all over Vegas, and this is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, awesome atmosphere and the staff is terrific. After calling 3 other places and requesting an area for 18 and all 3 saying NO, sorry. This place came through.  I called they were honest that it would take about 20 minutes but would be able to fit us all. They got our orders correct and even gave us separate checks. The amount of food is definitely enough to share and they even have small baskets of toys for kids entertainment."}
{"text":"What a cool place !  First time here -found on Yelp with 4. .5 stars approaching 300 reviews.  All we deserved.  Casual and fund place with alien gum ball eclectic decor.  Positive and pleasant staff with good recommendations review of menu.  Nice variety of specialty omelettes and other items - and the food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Amazing unique food, and fantastic service!! Frankie is probably the best server I've ever had. Super cool atmosphere too! Love the alien theme and names on the wall!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place was outta space.... Da food was very ono da service was da  chelsea n andrew was gr8...i would of course come back n try more items... Alooooha from Hawaii Fuentes n Silva Ohana"}
{"text":"Food was good and staff was very friendly- portion sizes are ridiculous ( huge!) which probably explains why the prices are so very high?! Fun vibe- but too pricey for breakfast-   Omelet  breakfast and coffee- $22.00 including tip! ( just for myself) ouch!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the absolute best spot for brunch in Las Vegas! From the good food to the awesome mimosas, we truly love this place. Good tunes playing too"}
{"text":"This is a great friendly atmosphere. We checked in and got our mimosas for free  My girlfriend and I both ordered the \"Racy Tracy\" which is their featured item on the menu. Its on omelette with bacon, mushrooms, monterey jack cheese, and avocados on top. You get a side of your choice bread and potatoes. You also get to choose your choice of sauce: cheese, salsa, or creamy mushroom. The creamy mushroom was really good. It cost about $14, which is a little pricier than other breakfast dine ins I've been to, but overall the place was clean and service was good. They also have a rewards program in which we signd up for... Birthday and anniversary discounts for you and your family. So we will definitely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome & delivery was fast but they really have zero idea what they're doing with their vegan menu!   My vegan sandwich had two whole avocados on it it seemed & was soggy even though it didn't have a drop of sauce or even oil/vinegar - so soggy I couldn't eat it. The patty looked dry too so nothing about it was appetizing. I also ordered it with pickles on the side but they were smooshed into the ridiculous amount of avocado on the soggy bread (nothing good about this mess.)  We also got the vegan potatoes which were supposed to come with scrambled tofu but came with weird cubes of tofu instead, plus it looked like again they have no idea what vegans eat so threw a bunch of veggies together with no rhyme or reason.   If you're just looking for vegan food steer clear."}
{"text":"King Crab Benedict!! Amazing Service was great and we sat next to the owner...very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito and burger for breakfast. The food is good. The service is great. This is a really amazing breakfast or lunch place. Plus it's alien/ Area 51 themed. You can write on the walls and they have activities for the kids. They can get really busy and be slow so just make time. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! The menu is filled with pictures and lots of tough decisions on so many tasty choices. I had a breakfast burrito that was hands down the best one I've ever had. It was consistent from start to finish (Which was only half cause it was huge). The waitress was very nice and  provided very friendly service. They've only been open about 2 weeks. This place is going to get busy fast. When it does, it'll be worth waiting to get in."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience on 4/23/17. We placed a mobile order, and went to pick up the order around the expected pick up time. Once we had arrived, we were told they had no record of our order so we provided the receipt, and was told that they would get the order ready as soon as possible. After waiting over an hour after the initial order, we were only provided half the order as they did not input the full order. They then told us to wait even longer after the mishap, and we eventually left. We contacted Yelp, and the representative told us they had contacted the restaurant 15 minutes into the order to confirm, yet somehow they still managed to lose our order. They told us they would refund us the money later that day, and we are still waiting for the refund. The level of service and treatment we received was completely unprofessional and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Service slow and not busy. Salad fair. Soup good. The other guests I was dining with said eggs were good but not exceptional . Kind of disappointing since I had read such great reviews. Staff friendly."}
{"text":"Came in excited and left underwhelmed. Where to begin..  Walked in on a cloudy Sunday morning around 10:30am and as expected there was a packed house! Which I don't think is a negative right away.. there has to be a reason right?!  ...The food is great and they don't have enough tables to seat everyone or the service is long and slow.. hmmmm. We were a party of 3.. my wife, daughter and of course me. We waited longer than needed as there were empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The place had personality as there was writing on the walls - that kept us entertained as we waited. Once we were seated the server was friendly and took our order. Our coffee and drinks came at a reasonable time. The coffee was good. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. As we looked around several others were growing restless waiting for their food. It was obvious by the looks on their faces. We had a few coffee refills and then waited and waited and waited. We watched as parties that arrived after us were served first, yet there were several people with empty cups and no food in sight. Finally, after what felt like a 20 to 30 minute wait the food arrived. It looked okay. I ordered the Racy Tracy, wife ordered So Cal Low Cal with side of fruit, and daughter ordered a teddy pancake. The Racy Tracy was loaded with bacon that didn't look freshly cooked, tasted below average. The potatoes were good (4 out of 5) nice and crispy but the omelette was bland and flavorless (3 out 5 at best). My meal came with toast and I got ONE piece cut in half (who does that?) - it is standard to get two pieces. My wife did not enjoy the So Cal Low Cal. Flavorless and earthy. She had to smoother it in Cholula hot sauce (1 out of 5). The fruit was a 5 of 5 - large portion, fresh, yummy.  My daughter's $6.50 pancake was chewy. Not fluffy, nothing special except the teddy shape. We had to use a knife to cut it - not appetizing.  It's hard to mess up a pancake, but this was not good.  The service was below average. They were friendly and nice, but disorganized and all over the place. When our bill came it was about $50 (for an average at best breakfast). Luckily we had a coupon for a free kids entree (the pancake).  We left less than impressed or satisfied. We would have been better off at a drive thru. I would not recommend this place nor would I return. This is unfortunate because we love eating out and love to see new places succeed. This place's claim to fame is that it was featured on a food network show. Unfortunately, it was not good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Thanks to Andrew (service was outstanding!) and the food was incredible! Plus I ate with the love of my life!"}
{"text":"We had our book club meeting here.  The atmosphere was Adorable, the service was Amazing and the food was Awesome!  Great menu!  AAA"}
{"text":"Found our new favorite breakfast spot. Friendly, attentive staff; very clean; ton of variety on the menu for both breakfast and lunch. We like to patronize the grassroots businesses in our neighborhood and these folks deserve your support. It won't be long until the word gets out about the delicious food and friendly atmosphere...then the place will be mobbed! Give Squeeze-In a shot and support small business that doesn't do the same old boring breakfast. You won't be disappointed, guaranteed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - the potatoes are kind of boring but they do have options to make them more flavorful like adding onions etc. the food portions were big, I couldn't finish my plate. They had buy 1 get 1 mimosas too - I didn't try one, but handy information!"}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy and they were the best and largest portion I have ever had. Our server Andrew gave us a run through of popular dishes and personal favorites and made sure our drink was always full. It was a great overall experience and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"food is good. very nice staff.  trendy place.  they serve alcohol at this restaurant which is unique for a breakfast place"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas. The customer service is amazing, they are very accommodating. Our waiter Andrew really took the time to make sure we ordered something we would thoroughly enjoy. The eggs Benedict with chorizo was delicious. Not to mention they have a spectacular Bloody Mary that will get any day started right. Incredible atmosphere and I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Found this place on YELP. Very fun menu which made it hard to decide what to eat, so got creative. Wanted a breakfast burrito but also an omelette so couldn't decide then realized they had me covered...you can turn any omelette into a burrito!! Got the hangover cure omelette, as a burrito. Was amazing! Also ordered the aunt Maggie stuffed French toast, which was also spot on and very satisfying!  Definitely will be back to try more of the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"In our opinion (wife and I) this place is way overrated and extremely overpriced! Our bill for a breakfast for two came close to $30.00 with tip. These are Bellagio or Caesars Palace prices! The four main competitors to this place ARE WAY BETTER! Here's my ratings, from best to worst, as follows: #1---Mr. Mamas on Jones & Decatur, #2--- Norm's Café on 3655 S. Durango, #3---The Egg and I--- on Tropicana just east of Ft. Apache, #4--- IHOP---All over town, #5---Squeeze In---reviewed by us as 2 Star."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a huge fan of breakfast; however the fiance is, and our go-to place is usually \"Rise & Shine\", which also gets great reviews.. This place blew them out of the water!  A friend of mine suggested we go here, so I thought I'd give it a whirl so I could at least see if I thought it was a place my fiance would like... OMG!!!   As soon as we walked in, the hostess greeted us warmly with a smile. Server went out of her way to make sure we were completely taken care of. Ambiance was pretty cool. Bathrooms were clean.   The menu, omg!! As a vegetarian, (and the fiance is a meat eater), I'm used to settling for a house salad, or some crazy, modified version of a menu item that takes the poor server 20 minutes to put in the computer, for it to then usually come out wrong. They have so many vegetarian options!! HUGE bonus for me. We had 2 mimosas, and ended up splitting the \"Buckin Buster\" omelet. (The individual portions are huge, btw). Comes with sausage (we got it on the side for him to eat), spinach, mushrooms, and Monterey Jack cheese, with potatoes and sourdough toast. Everything tasted absolutely amazing!! So flavorful, and, like I said, this is coming from someone who doesn't even really like breakfast food! I usually add ketchup or hot sauce to an omelet, but that would have been a serious injustice to this omelet. Absolutely sensational! Can't wait to bring the fiance here, and I can easily see this being our new breakfast place. (Although probably the other location that's closer to our house lol). Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait for the Centennial Hills location to open!  Randomly found Squeeze In on Yelp and so glad that we made the trek all the way from NLV.  Dining room is eclectic and homey.  The hostess had baskets of toys to keep our kids occupied while we waited to order and then to get food, and we had fun reading all the messages written on the walls.    The menu is GIANT and I love all the \"pro tips\" for nearly every menu item.  I tend to narrow my choices down to 2-3 and then ask my server what his/her recommendation is, so I was very happy to have someone who wasn't afraid to share her opinions.  The Chorizo benedict (with the pro tips: add avocado and get the potatoes Otis Style - with grilled onions and melted cheese) was incredible!  And filling - I think we stopped in for brunch, and I was so full I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day.  Husband got the Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes, and they didn't disappoint (let me back this up with Jack Johnson's song banana pancakes was one of the things that brought my husband and me together, so we absolutely love banana pancakes and rainy days... and he's not a fan of walnuts, but LOVED his meal).  Entire staff was inviting, loved being there, and accommodating.  They have a rewards program, and I got a coupon for a free mimosa on our next visit!  Definitely going back, but super excited that they're already planning to open another location closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Best Omelette in Vegas! Queen Maggie very good if you like French toast! Friendly staff!  Visitor from Dallas"}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Andrew & all of the staff. I got the Holy Crab & loved it. Everything is priced reasonably on the menu. What a great way to start the New Year:)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast! Good food and service, the staff is truly happy and it's refreshing to have such a hospitable meal! The management must be great as everyone has an amazing positive attitude!"}
{"text":"Looking for a breakfast place on my recent visit to LV.  This place is outstanding.  Portions are huge, carefully prepared and served by an attentive and helpful wait staff.  Out server wisely counseled (Andrew) a short stack of walnut pancakes for me and a half portion of Maggie's Special (cream cheese stuffed French toast) for my sister. He was correct since both dishes were more that adequate in size and both were delicious.  Excellent coffee and OJ.  A perfect way to start the day."}
{"text":"Andrew does the most amazing job taking care of every single customer that walks in this establishment. He's consistently running around but still as this very calm vibe that makes it easy to enjoy your time here. There wasn't a single customer that walked through the door without being greeted in a gracious way. I absolutely love his positive attitude."}
{"text":"Continuing our search for the perfect breakfast this place came very very close.    The decor is a rather quirky mix of space-alien, graffiti and old barn finds.  And I'm not sure if they have two matching tables in the place.  Their name is appropriate to the open, tight fitting, but glassy and bright seating plan.  It was somewhat noisy, but tolerable.    The menu is extensive and filled with usual and unusual selections which also have unusual and unexpected names.  But the food is excellent.  I had what  they call Zweifel (Zwy-full) which is a peanut butter omelet with apples and bananas, sautéed in butter and honey in an omelette with peanut butter. I also added bacon to run up the score. That combination might seem a bit strange, but it was delicious. This was one of the dishes that could be made gluten free by substituting corn tortillas for toast, but sadly that taste didn't fit.    My wife had the Bombshelter Bacon Benny which is English muffin topped with bacon, mushrooms and sauteed in a wine sauce with three poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce and avocado slices.  She liked it so much she was still talking about it well into the afternoon.   As usual we got there at just about the peak hour, but the wait for a table wasn't too long.  The wait for the food was a bit longer than I like, but all and all not too bad.  And the staff was helpful and courteous and kept our coffee cups full, which helped mitigate the wait time.    It was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good. It's a happy change to have a neighborhood restaurant that actually knows how to make a good omelette. Ingredients are fresh, portions are generous. The menu is very comprehensive. The downside that will limit future visits is price. $45.00 for breakfast for 2 is a bit steep. This is not The Strip, it's a strip mall in the SW. Yes, portions are big and we had leftovers, but their price points add some apprehension."}
{"text":"\"We take our alcohol very seriously\" -The waiter  FOOD: If you're in the mood for a big meal for breakfast, this is your place. Their orders are all made to order with fresh ingredients. Their basic breakfast alone came with bacon, potatoes, eggs, toast, and a huge side of biscuits and gravy. Way too much food for me! One downside about this place is that they do not serve white bread. Their menu though is very complex with many original dishes that I have never seen at any other breakfast restaurants.  DRINK: If you're in the mood for a bloody mary or mimosa, I'll tell you what the waiter said to me, \"the drinks here are made with 98% alcohol and 2% juice.\" They really aren't stingy with their drinks! I highly recommend the Hi-Mosa, cranberry-orange-champagne. There's also juice and coffee if you're not in the mood for alcohol;)  ATMOSPHERE: Aliens O.o There is literally aliens everywhere! The owner had a farm where he made alien statues and the neighbors would steal them and put them around other neighbors lawns. So the owner decided to bring the alien to this restaurant. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant has a bright and welcoming atmosphere.  OVERALL: Decent food, big portions, tons of alcohol and weird aliens O.o"}
{"text":"Fantastically creative dishes, good sized portions, plenty of breakfast style cocktails, and excellent service! This all combines into a great all around breakfast experience"}
{"text":"Great spot! Fantastic menu options. My new breakfast spot. Mimosas, bloody Mary's oh yeah."}
{"text":"Breakfast places seem to be popping up all over the place. We decided to give this one a try based on the proximaty to home, the overall reviews, and, not gonna lie, Bobby Flay.   First, check in and you get a free drink. Score! Both the BF and I got Bloody Mary's which were large and strong.   The menu is pretty big, busy and a bit overwhelming. I went with the \"Racy Tracy,\" dish made famous because of Bobby Flay. The BF went with the \"Twice Baked Scramble.\"   I expected some good food but both dishes were pretty bad. The bacon in mine was way overcooked and I couldn't even taste the mushrooms, although I saw them in there. The omelette itself looked and tasted like it was from Denny's. It had an unnatural super bright yellow color to it and was so fluffy it had no taste. Like eating a bunch of airpockets.  The BF'S scramble was better than my dish but that isn't saying much. Same with his bacon. Just overcooked to the point it doesn't taste like bacon anymore.   I don't get it. Based on the reviews, I really expected some good food but left very disappointed. I will say the staff was super nice and the place itself is cool. But that doesn't make up for the subpar food. Maybe it was just a bad morning?"}
{"text":"The food is original and delicious. To top it off, the portions are really generous. I guarantee you will leave this place feeling satisfied. The staff is super friendly and attentive. They will make you feel at home. I almost forgot, kids are allowed to draw on the walls too! Allie who runs the place is amazing! Don't leave without trying the Jack Johnson pancakes and the crab omelet!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  Loved the decor. It feels like your stepping back into the seventies with love Winnebago on the wall and peace signs.   But the good part is the food, moderately price. Great portion sizes and a friendly staff.  I had the tuna melt with sprouts and avocado with friends and it was almost to much to finish. They have a vegan menu and great hamburgers I've heard for meat eaters. Go there you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint to take the whole family! Huge menu with something for everyone. We've enjoyed a couple scrambles, the burrito, a Benedict, pancakes and stuffed French toast. Only thing I've had that I wasn't a huge fan of was the biscuit and gravy surprisingly. It looks amazing...a huge biscuit slathered in gravy. My biscuit was a bit dense and dry unfortunately and the gravy lacked that peppery, sausage goodness I was craving that day. It want terrible, just wasn't what I was hoping for.  Looking forward to digging deeper into this menu to find some more favorites!"}
{"text":"Always a great place!!! I come here often and the service and food is always amazing, there biscuits are huge too!! For your birthday they send you a $10 off card if you are a rewards member and for anniversaries you get a free bottle of champagne!!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Servers very friendly and attentive. Quick to be seated and good food. Good location by the regal collenade."}
{"text":"west flamingo animal hospital SHERRI the office lady was very nice and helpful,,"}
{"text":"The service was fine, but the food was mediocre. The biscuits and gravy were bland. The biscuits were a bit burned on the bottom. My friend's food didn't look very appetizing, and she confirmed that it wasn't."}
{"text":"Andrew was awesome, and he wasn't even our server! Although he greeted us, took our order, got the drinks we asked our server for, checked on our food and made we were ok. But not in an imposing way, apperntly it was obvious we werent getting any service...while having tables of his own. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service is outstanding. Food is delicious. Jenna and Teddy are excellent servers.   The Garth sandwich is EFFIN YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast! Right off of Eastern and Pebble. Friendly staff. The menu will blow you away. I had a 1/2 order of bicuits and gravy and eggs. I can't  wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"this place is incredible! it has such a great energy and atmosphere and all the employees are so positive and energetic! (especially Frankie!! she is adorable and by far the best server!)   i love that they let you write on the walls, lets us add our own stamp on the place! so glad they opened up so close to our house- i think we've found our new breakfast spot!   the bloody mary was amazing, and all the food was incredible! i love how creative the menu is!   and plus- anywhere with a giant yellow weird thing that my daughter can love on is amazing to me!"}
{"text":"You definitely do have to squeeze in here, it was packed when we went and unfortunately had to sit right by the door. Blinding glare from the sun every time it opened and a cold breeze. That aside, our server was fantastic and seemed really familiar with the menu. Or at least did a good job faking it with all of our questions. Portions are huge."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The food was good but prices were a little high for the value. I had a Denver omelet and it was loaded with bell pepper and not much ham. The coffee was a plus."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Talk about pancake surprise, the Jack Johnson pancakes are something I will dream about and crave for years to come! The service was fantastic and made us feel like family. My wife and I are visiting from Texas for 3 days but we will be back before we leave. If you are anywhere near here you must go!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had a breakfast sandwich and it was nice and juicy and not dry."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast restaurant that had Good omelets. This place his a diverse menu with both the basics and some interesting takes on how to combine eggs and other essential breakfast foods into something that really comes out great. Came in twice now and haven't been disappointed yet! Everything seems to be made with quality ingredients, service is great and no matter how busy they were everything was very fast. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fresh made. Andrew was very outgoing & helpful in narrowing down our selection from the many choices."}
{"text":"This place is more than meets the eyes. From the outside it looks small and ordinary, it's also kind of hard to find tucked in the back corner of the shopping center. However, once you're inside the place is much more lively than you would expect and also larger.   The menus is overwhelming, it's huge and not exactly easy to navigate. The bright side to this is nearly everything looked or sounded good.   The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more attentive. Our food came out in a timely manner as well. As for the food; I thought it had great flavor and was prepared well. The only negative for me was that the potatoes were greasy, at least for my taste. I don't usually eat food that heavy so when I come back I'd probably order off of their lighter menu.   Overall I'm giving it a four because I think that's what it deserves, even if it wasn't 100% to my taste."}
{"text":"Great vegan options, and very friendly staff.  Have a great tofu scramble and can easily make modifications, the staff is very understanding and helpful.  They also have reward program."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast and got a quick table with good service. Tried some breakfast staples- French toast, eggs, bacon, etc. The food was good but a little blank, and the price was ok.  I'd pick it over the Cracked Egg any day and wouldn't object to going back, but it would be a standby in the breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"this place was a cute little brunch spot that my friend found. The food was HUGE and worth its price. plus they give out unlimited bread and potatoes when you order certain entres"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and atmosphere.  When I'm in a healthy mood, I go for the DJ's So Cal Low Cal (delicious egg white burrito).  When I'm in a decadent mood, I got for the Jack Johnson pancakes (whoa!).  Sign up for the EggHeads rewards for great coupons and promotions.  Definitely busier on the weekends, so plan to head there early or wait."}
{"text":"I had thee most amazing pancakes here, I came with my friends an we all had great meals and they were pretty big portions plus our waitress Tina was totally amazing, great service"}
{"text":"Positive: Friendly and attentive staff. Large portions. HUGE Menu that includes Vegan & Gluten Free options.  Other: Maybe we just didn't order the right things.   IMHO there are two kinds of successful breakfast places in Vegas. Simple and cheap (like any of the downtown casino breakfast places) or more creative and expensive (like EAT or Rise & Shine). I'm willing to pay $30 or more for an exceptional breakfast for two - otherwise, I'll go pay $5 at a cheap and easy diner. So unless you're doing something interesting, eggs and toast is eggs and toast. Why pay more? Our total here (including coffee) was $34 (which was partially covered by a groupon purchase). Squeeze In had the high prices without the food to match it.   I got the \"Southwestern Spuds\" which the menu described as potatoes \"scrambled\" with various other things - including tofu. I was surprised to find the tofu to be just... fried tofu, kinda sitting on top of the dish (see photo). There wasn't much of it, and there wasn't any attempt to spice or flavor it at all. The rest of the dish felt similar - kinda thrown together, but very very plain.  The strongest taste was \"oil\". It was quite greasy. I guess what made it \"Southwestern\" was that it was served with a side of salsa, and came with some (plain) black beans on the side. I definitely wouldn't order it again.  My date had the \"Manly Morris Meal\" - which was your basic Eggs, Bacon, Potatoes, & Toast with a single (large) biscuit & gravy on the side. The server asked if he would like anything with the potatoes, and suggested onions. When it came out, sure enough, there were onions - but just raw onions, chopped and placed on top. Not cooked or prepared - not even cooked into the spuds -  just a couple of tablespoons of raw chopped onions for fifty cents extra. The biscuit tasted like it had been in the fridge or freezer for a while, and the gravy was bland and floury.   I appreciate the nice environment and the friendly service. The huge portions are impressive. But I would rather have interesting and thoughtfully prepared food in smaller portions and at smaller prices."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'll start with the good. Our server Jhalisa was a rockstar. She was on top of everything. Always had coffee and water, and she was friendly and helpful. The portions were excellent for the price. My daughters pancakes were delicious, fluffy, and the sausage was delicious. The decor is funky, and I love that it's unique.  Now for the not great. The food. I had HUGE expectations after ordering from UberEats for breakfast-- the eggs benedict were great, and the fruit was fresh. When we went in... I was completely let down. The food was BLAND. The only flavor was the jalapenos in the omelette I ordered-- which should've been full of flavor. I even added avocado, and it was fresh, but we were SO bummed. My husband's omelette had zero taste other than the pastrami. The eggs were definitely fresh but severely lacking in flavor. It was like everything needed salt and pepper. The chunks of potato were huge and portions were good, but no salt, no pepper, nothing. As we're both on keto, we didn't eat potatoes, and would've loved the option to sub out carbs for protein, like we can at other restaurants. I had such high expectations, but I was definitely let down."}
{"text":"Place is great first time in today. Great food options great service coffee nice and hot. Good deals on your birthday too."}
{"text":"Went here the day after Christmas, was a little packed but we were seated pretty quickly. Food was really good and came out quickly.   Ambience is different. There is writing on the wall, but it makes this place unique. Seems like this place is a hidden little gem. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Krista is one of the most professional server we have encountered in awhile. She knew the whole menu up and down, also offered different ways to customize our meals. Not only did she have an inviting attitude; she also had a great upbeat energy that made us comfortable at Squeeze In.   The menu is has a lot of great choices and the food came out so fresh and hot."}
{"text":"We started our day today with Squeeze in and boy did they set my day off on the right foot! There's nothing better than a family laid back type atmosphere! Thanks Krys for your wonderful service! If you go don't cheat yourself by not trying their house potatoes with grilled onions and cheese! Entrees are big enough to split and still leave more than satisfied! I will definitely be a repeat offender here!"}
{"text":"Yelp always comes thru with great suggestions and this is one of them.  Their wide variety of breakfast selections will take you a few minutes to review.  Once you decide, you should definitely try their tomato pesto sauce to go with your eggs....so yummy!  Their pancakes are nice and fluffy and their portions are huge so you'll have extras to take home."}
{"text":"This place is the best yet drinks and great food who could ask for more then the service our waiter Jenna she is the best it was my first time and won't be my last THANK YOU SO MUCH JENNA your the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop on the weekend for us. We have been to the Sparks location when ever we are in the area, so happy they have opened in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"On our first visit to this place, we were immediately greeted by Andrew, the assistant manager who made our experience even better with his friendliness and open mindedness. The menu is huge and very diverse (not to mention colorful); it is just a matter of what ingredients you like. Portions are very generous and food very tasty. Coll place; they actually let you bring your own paraphernalia and hang it up if they see it appropriate and consistent with their very colorful decor. Andrew even let us hang our first two \"good luck\" Dollar bills on their wall behind the register, hopefully other will follow. We can't wait to go back and try other things from their huge menu. Great place for kids too, and plenty of space between tables so you don't feel too crowded."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Fun atmosphere. Really enjoyed the experience. Holy Crab is scrumdiliumpcious."}
{"text":"Had a coupon, so hubby and I thought to try it. Delicious!!!  All ingredients are freshly made - no frozen anything (that I'm aware of). Great service - very attentive. Coffee kept filled. Multiple staff checking on us to see if we needed anything, but not intrusive. Wonderful hidden gem, and plan to return often. Get here early on a Sunday - but the wait is with it!"}
{"text":"So glad you opened a location in Henderson that is closer to my house.    The food, service and atmosphere was amazing.  The artist who did your ceilings is talented and I love the fact that I was able to put my mark on the walls of the place!     Loved the sour dough and the seasoning on the potatoes!  WOW!    Frankie was our severs and was wonderful!!   Thanks for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is my first time here.. The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is comfy and the food is deliscious.  Big servings. I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast place I always enjoy coming to. The food is great, the decorations are awesome, and our server Andrew is always perfect!! He's so nice and  makes sure you're well taken care of. My daughter didn't like what she ordered and he had no problem taking it back for something else. The crab cakes Benedict are delicious! All around a great atmosphere, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot ever! I used to frequent the Squeeze Inn during my collegiate days in Reno, and as silly as it sounds, was sad that I wouldn't be able to eat there again unless I made a random trip up there.  So you can imagine my excitement to learn that the business was expanding and coming down to Vegas!   Upon my first visit I was amazed to see the atmosphere was the same as I remembered. Seeing bikes hanging from the ceiling and writing on the wall was a welcomed bit of nostalgia. The place is adorable with the unique traits and characteristics. It is more than a restaurant and more like that kooky aunt you know and love.  And while the character of the establishment is fabulous, it wouldn't be much without the excellent service and food. Andrew is one of the best servers I have ever had. He remembered my friend and I from our first visit a month ago. The other servers are fabulous too. Always smiling and willing to answer your questions. I don't believe I've ever had bad service at Squeeze Inn. Simply put, the people are friendly and fast, something that makes a lot of the experience.   And the food, don't get me started! I always find a new favorite on each visit! The menu is also quite inclusive meaning you can bring your vegetarian and vegan friends without worry. And if you want to special order something, I always add or take out things, it's no trouble. Or at least, they act like it isn't.  I truly love this establishment and would eat there everyday if I could. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're looking for good food, go here."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is good, the wait staff are very personable. The food is VERY slow to arrive. Some of that can be attributed to homemade from scratch, but it's even longer than that. I don't know that kitchen is staffed adequately for the peaks. Having said that, if you don't mind waiting, the food is fantastic. They do have toys/activities for kids but don't go if you have hungry kids who have to eat NOW."}
{"text":"Finally! A breakfast food place that doesn't disappoint! Most breakfast places have the usual: french toast, pancakes, waffles, toast. The same 4 things in different flavors... BORING and a ripoff considering you can easily make these foods at home. But Squeeze In is a miracle for people like me who enjoy going out for breakfast. First of all, the place has a very comfortable vibe. You can walk right in an pick any table of your choice, indoor or outdoor. The theme and decor is also very adorable! It's fun to look around and point out all the things on the walls while you wait for your food. Now for the food...THE BEST part of course. Their menu gives you plenty of options to choose from, insuring that no matter what you're in the mood for, they'll have something for everyone who goes. This place really is for everyone considering they have gluten free & vegetarian options.  They have multiple omelettes, sandwiches, wraps, etc., and of course the normal breakfast foods like pancakes and such, but it's all home made! So it's all automatically 10 times better than any old Denny's or iHop. My personal favorite thing to get on the menu is 'Uncle Danny's Burrito' when I'm in the mood for more of a meaty meal of a breakfast.  If you're currently debating on if you should try this place for the first time PLEASE DO! You'll find yourself wanting to go every morning just to try something new on their exclusive menu, it's unlike any food I've ever heard of from a breakfast place! This is most definitely a hidden jem in Las Vegas, their food will not disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas for 14.99!!!!The Garth Sandwich was Filling and made to perfection, I loved every bite. My Fiancé and I went in yesterday and not only is the menu priced perfectly, the bottomless mimosas were amazing, they have all sorts of flavors and they all are yummy! they don't hold back on the champagne either, this place was perfect for a Friday morning brunch, and I would recommend this to anyone who has family visiting from out of town for a nice and damn good priced meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing omelettes and an extensive menu- something for everyone at Squeeze In.  We have been here several times and the food is always quality. The omelettes are some of the best I have ever eaten.  The reason for the 4 starts as opposed to 5 is that the service tends to be a little slow at times and there have been mistakes made on the order. A lot of this can be attritubed to the fact that they are a new restaurant but are already popular and busy.  What pleases me is that the customer service is always on par and they address customer complaints. For example, there was a problem with my order and they had to re-make my meal. The server apologized for putting the order in wrong (did not blame it on the kitchen-huge bonus for me since the kitchen always gets blamed for everything) and took the meal off my check. I wasn't even upset my meal was delayed because I was so impressed with the customer service.  Check in on yelp to receive a free drink of your choice. We got bloody Mary's which were awesome. This place warrants a weekly visit for sure!"}
{"text":"New place in town ~     I always say it's breakfast! How hard is that?    This is a new breakfast \ lunch place in Henderson a couple doors down from the movie theatre on Eastern & Pebble.    A VERY large menu with interesting & diverse options, loved the icons on the ceiling tiles can't say I like this new trend of having diners writing on the walls..... just looks unkept to me.....however you know what they say about opinions.....     I always have a basic breakfast the first time a new place, 2 eggs scrambled, bacon (4 pieces, that's a lot!) potatoes & toast this is called a Rednecker.com, I think ~     All OK, could have hotter as it wasn't cold, just not hot and we all know eggs get cool quick! They are very proud of their potatoes......nothing FAB to me and I am a potato lover from waaaaay back.    The hubs has the Benedict..... same issue could have been hotter & the muffins were wet from the poached eggs not being drained b4 serving~    Coffee was good & plentiful in large cups. Lovely staff all very friendly, helpful & attentive.     Would we go back? SURE! And just request it to be served hotter next time. They are only open 7am ~ 2pm, take CC & if you can't find something on this menu to eat~ your just being difficult!"}
{"text":"Omg yum yum yum!!! Dion was so nice and helpful w th menu! The food came out pipping hot and the drinks were generous in their adult pours. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite brunch spot. Pitchers of mimosas or bellinis and reasonably priced egg dishes. The service is super nice and quick. Become a egghead breakfast club member and you will receive discounts and offers the more often you come here. Prices are very reasonable and checking into yelp gives you 50% off alcohol purchases"}
{"text":"I like the staff they truly exert effort to make you feel comfortable. They will help you pick the best food they have according to your taste. This place serving is big as well. We ordered 2 entree for the 3 of us. I will come back."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was big and super good. Our waitress Frankie was very attentive to us. She always made sure we had everything. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"We always love this place and it's the first choice to bring out of town visitors... the food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is incredible... Andrew is our server today and many times in the past, he is always on point, friendly, fast and flawless... LOVE Andrew... he's currently handling a 4th of July morning rush basically by himself and still isn't letting our drinks get empty... GREAT JOB SQUEEZED IN!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place.  You can write on the walls and get yummy food. It's a little pricey, but hey we are in Vegas. We've been here a few times and I recommend you give it a try. It's back in a little shopping center off Fort Apache."}
{"text":"Food = just Ok,  Service = NoT  I was super excited to try this place!  To start...No greeting upon entering, probably because it was packeD (this place has mostly standing room while waiting)... but I am always willing to wait and hope it'll be worth it... this was not. Took a few minutes for our waitress to approach our table after we were finallY seated, just to tell us she'd be right back.  We did get our drinks ordered (finally) by another staff member (ps. Check in for a free cocktail) which 2 of us ordered (that deserves the 2 stars) I ordered the Manly Morris (nothing special about this good Ol breakfast...potatoes def need some flavor, simple seasonings go a long way) I also ordered a side of biscuits & gravy...which didn't come with the the rest of our food and our waitress noticed, because as she she sped by our table she mentioned it would be right out. By the time i finished most of my meal I caught our waitress to inquire about the biscuits and gravy, she again said it would be right out...I asked her to bring a to go box since I was full. She brought the food no box...she finally stopped by to check on our meal, I reminded her that I needed a box. She walked around with boxes in her hand but didn't return so i asked another server for boxes which somehow prompted our server to return with boxes and to let us know she comped our cocktails, I informed her we had already \"checked in\" for the cocktails...her response \"oh good\"...the only person smiling that provided good customer service was the one refilling our drinks (I wish I caught her name). What a disappointment, I dont understand the great reviews, there were others visually dissatisfied, maybe they're not yelpers. Customer service with a smile and appreciation for my business might have made up for the sub par food and wait times but noPe...too many other options in this area...and there's always  Egg Works where regardless of how busy they are customer service and food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband had found this restaurant and we decided to go for brunch. There was no wait but the place was packed. We sat down at a really wobbly table but I still gave this place a chance because I wanted to try there food. The food was ok. Nothing too special really. I got coffee and she said they had flavored creamers but she only brought hazelnut and that made me laugh but oh well hazelnut is good. The seating wasn't comfortable. We couldn't fit all the plates on the table. Would I go back... honestly i don't know. Maybe. I would have to be craving it but there is so many othe options in Las Vegas with better seats, easier menus where you don't get confused with so many pictures and words and also they need more options for kids and drinks. The coffee was just ok. Need more coffee options. They do have a lot of booze options thought."}
{"text":"Actually saw 2 guys dressed as bacon and eggs in costumes on the corner, so decided to give them a try. Hostess was top notch, A+, she turned out to be our waitress too, ( Mel I believe was her name) A+ all the way around as far as service goes. Food was very good as well, very large portions. My only huge Negative and why this isn't a 5 Star review, is the Alien sign outside the front door, has a long stand at the very bottom that is hard to see, as I walked by it, wearing sandals, I nailed my pinky toe on it, ripping the nail completely off with blood everywhere. Owners, please relocate this sign if you feel it's necessary, as someone could get seriously hurt. Great food, service, and atmosphere, sign is useless and dangerous."}
{"text":"I found this place to be very overpriced and the quality was not very good. Our waitress and sevice was great though. I might come back just to try something different if I feel like spending that much $ on a breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"We love local places and saw this one on Yelp. Both of our dishes were excellent and I can't wait to return to try additional items. He ordered the Dirty Dick and I ordered the Queen Maggie. Nice atmosphere and clean."}
{"text":"Being a Reno/Tahoe transplant to Vegas, we definitely miss the small town, home cooking restaurant feel. A place where you could sit & relax, enjoy the great atmosphere, & even better food! Well I can't tell you how excited I am that Squeeze In is in Vegas! Although you notice little differences in the food than the original in Truckee & followers in Reno; they still knock breakfast out of the park! Mimosas are smaller, Bloody Mary isn't as good as Truckee's, but still ok! It's nice to have a regular breakfast place again-I hope they open up many many more!"}
{"text":"Really wanted this to be our new breakfast place.... Waited 35 minutes for breakfast and it wasn't busy. The water isn't filtered, the potatoes were horrible and cold,, with a cheese clumped on top with cold onions. Food was very bland. Sorry Squeeze In won't be back."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here but I'm finally getting around to a review. Everything about this place I love!  Super interesting atmosphere, lots to look at and keep the eyes interested. Art, records, aliens and a bike on the ceiling:) You can even leave your mark if you wish! Service is always extremely friendly, informative and helpful. I had a Baileys and coffee with whipped and sprinkles, it was made just right and hit the spot. My food was the twice baked scramble and it was both delicious and huuge! I was stuffed and had to pack up half.  Drinks were always topped up, great portion sizes, eclectic environment, fun staff and a great playlist to boot! You definitely want to dine at Squeeze In!"}
{"text":"Had Squeeze In while in Truckee, CA.....so glad to see that they have migrated south...the food here is just as good as the food up north....portions were more than enough to satisfy even the hungriest of the hungry....i test all restaurants by how well they do biscuits and gravy. Let me just say these are by far the best I have had in a very long time.  i look forward to trying them for lunch...great prices, great food and better yet... great service...Andrew you are the best..."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for brunch in Vegas! Not sure why it took me this long to give this place a try! I went here on a Saturday at 1pm, there was only about 5 minute wait for a party of 2.   My friend and I both ordered each a Bloody Mary, and boy was that delicious! I love a spicy Bloody Mary and there's we're definitely full of flavors! I ordered a queen Maggie which was their French toast and my friend ordered a jack Johnson banana walnut pancakes. The pancakes were so big and fluffy packed with banana flavor and my French toast was stuffed with cream cheese which I thought was very different but delicious! Our server suggested to do half size for both and I'm so glad we did because we couldn't even finish the half sized plates! We also got a side order of chocolate bacon which was surprisingly good!   Our server told us to check in and he comped on of our bloody Mary's which I thought was very generous. I can't wait to come back again to try more because their menu is full of great things! Next time I'll try some savory dishes!"}
{"text":"I mean you can't really mess up breakfast food, unless the food comes in an hour late and 2 other tables that came after us already got their food. At least we weren't the three other parties that walked out cuz their food never came. They need a better system. The servers were walking around with plates of food randomly asking tables if they ordered it, like what?! Maybe just don't come for Sunday breakfast, or when they're busy...  Also maybe invest in more toasters, never got our toast cuz they said it was too busy to use."}
{"text":"Huge portions but for $20 for a plate of eggs and an orange juice they've better be. I got the hang over platter. They told I can opt for scrambled style or omelette. I said scrambled got omelette.  Then she offered to cover my food with Otis style, grilled onions and melted cheese. The strands of cheddar were still visible in fact a few of them individually rolled over the top as I brushed some of the onions over my eggs. I was afraid to eat the cheese so I picked most of it off. The potatoes and the sourdough toast were the highlights of my meal. If they named a dish after me, with potatoes and toast, I might come back.  But to spend a good portion of my tips on eggs, not how I ordered them, I might just get a big breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for the first time. I'm usually at Sunrise Cafe right now. I'm glad I came here. Food is excellent, service is good and although the prices are a little on the high side, it is well worth the extra couple dollars, fresh food and the environment has a great vibe, and they played Tom Petty over the speakers. Very cool company I can tell"}
{"text":"Really cool vibes at this place. They have many unique options on the menu that make it hard to choose from. Service was excellent, no complaints there .  I had the queen maggie. Which is \"stuffed\" French toast. Anytime I see this on menus I always order it and I was highly disappointed. So much so that I read all the yelp reviews on it. It is sliced cream cheese. Which I've never seen before. Not fluffy or whipped or soft. It didn't seem very stuffed but more so like an undercooked grilled cheese. To make an accurate comparison it was like slices of French toast with thick mozzarella slices in the middle. I've never had stuffed French toast with unmelted cream cheese, so that was a first. And not very tasteful. So I switched with my boyfriend who ordered Colins bossburger. I didn't like it at first because all burgers are cooked medium well, and we agreed but should have asked for medium. The patty itself was dry and had no flavor. After getting halfway through I remembered that it was supposed to come with sauce, so I reminded our server and she brought us a side of burger sauce. This definitely made the burger. It added flavor and moisture and just made everything taste better. We upgraded our fries to garlic fries and they were delicious! Definitely have a prominent garlic flavor. Overall, not sure if I'll be back. But the portions were very big so it made my Groupon very worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Eastern location a few times now and my best advice is to go during the week. Otherwise, the name becomes quite apropos. The omelettes are quite good and more than I can finish and my wife enjoys the Eggs Benedict.  Tip: Try the Racy Tracy and add onions to the side of potatoes."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food!! Best Bloody Mary I've ever had;) You have to try the King crab eggs Benedict and the King crab omelet Tgey are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Fun atmosphere great food and friendly service. The omelettes are to die for! The hangover helper was amazing. Lots of meat in this thing! The restaurant is kind of hidden in the corner of the shopping center so make sure you don't miss it. Well worth your time finding this place! Jo and Brooke were amazing!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! This is quickly becoming my favorite breakfast stop. The staff in the morning is awesome, Allie and Frankie definitely go above and beyond to make every visit better than the last! The only complaint I have is their menu - there are just too many excellent things that I want to try and I can never decide!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The stuff was really nice and very helpful. Will definitely go over there for breakfast again when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"First time here, recommend by the wife whose company had breakfast here recently. Had the Aztec omelette with green salsa and potatoes. Awesome. Wife had Manly More breakfast with biscuits and gravy. Frankie was our server and she is awesome."}
{"text":"Food is really just so so. Nothing special. Sorry to say (usually don't want to give not nice review)... We had Racy Tracy, which is supposed to be their signature. As another helper said, The egg was dry and overcook. The bacon stuffed inside was not crispy. The Otis potatoes were recommended and tasted fine. Just a little surprise that the server didn't mention the extra almost $2 charge.   Staff seemed a bit disorganized and inexperienced. There's no sign to seat yourself nor wait to be seated. Cashier was nice."}
{"text":"My husband always says that going out for breakfast has got to be one of my wife's favorite things.  It certainly is.  Luckily I am surrounded by many good breakfast options.  Squeeze In has definitely been added to the list.  I stopped in with a friend for a breakfast treat.  They have a great variety of breakfast items to try.    This morning was \"try an omelette\" day.   One of their specialties was the Racy Tracy Omelette.  It is a 4 egg omelette filled with mushrooms, bacon and jack cheese topped with fresh avocado.  They really are generous with the filling.  The omelette was overflowing with mushrooms and bacon.  Not complaining at all!  The side of breakfast potatoes was really a bushel of potatoes.  Your plate will be piled high with this side with plenty to take home.     The dining area is filled with fun and quirky decor.  I think this rubs off on the waitstaff.  Service was really friendly and helpful.  I will be happy to come back and try one of their lunch options."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has as many stars as it does because the food was absolutely terrible . I ordered the chilaquiles sub the tofu for scrambled eggs when my order came out after waiting for 20-25 minutes it was wrong , no eggs & still had tofu . They quickly brought me some undercooked scrambled eggs on the side . The tortilla chips were hard so it was more like nachos which isn't what I wanted . I took a few bites and didn't eat anymore of it . I didn't want to complain but it was pretty obvious considering I didn't touch my food . The server didn't ask about it she just took my full plate and handed me the check (still upcharging me for the eggs). Unfortunately I'll never be returning as there are sooo many better breakfast options in town ."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3 stars, but the fact that not one of the three of us really enjoyed our food really makes this a two star joint. I had the twice baked scramble. Flavorless and bland (same complaints on the rest of the order). Nothing special. I'd go to omelette house or the like before I go to this place ever again. What makes this visit the worst is that there is a really good breakfast place called Truffles and Bacon in the same lot but I felt like trying someplace new... Now this place isn't bad, it's just nothing special like it pretends to be. It's also really expensive, especially considering their smallish portion size."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service, overall wait untill food actually hit the table was about 1hr and then when food got there they did not have silverware on the table so we had to wait another 10 mins to get the waiters attention to tell them we did not have silverware we even had to wait 10 mins for coffee refills and water this overall experience was theeee worst the 1 star im giving is for the food, it was decent with big portions"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas, I tried this restaurant. So happy I did. Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff was extremely friendly. Our waitress was Krystalyn and she made this a five-star experience. She was awesome! Can't wait to retun."}
{"text":"Food network hype always helps get people's attention...  This place is popular and good for them. As for my own experience...it was ok but didn't leave me thinking about my next visit.  I wasn't interested in the dish that was featured so I ordered a simple egg breakfast because that's how I judge breakfast places (can they cook my eggs correctly?). Unfortunately my over medium eggs had a bunch of undercooked white goo. Potatoes, toast & turkey sausage were all good. My man's ham & cheese scramble was also good.   I also got excited to see a free Yelp checkin offer for a cocktail beverage & decided on a mimosa. It was a hearty size but whatever store bought OJ they use ruined the drink and I only drank a few sips. Bummer! I think I'm spoiled by all the breakfast places that offer freshly squeezed juice.   Now here's the part that bothered me the most, our table. We were sat at a outdoor type of table with a tile top that everything kept sliding around on. This just annoyed me and as I looked around none of the other mismatched furniture was like our table so I guess we just got unlucky. Just put a few doily's on this table and that'll solve that.   Service wasn't very friendly either as our waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast brunch or lunch. It's a popular place in Cali but now it's becoming popular in Vegas. Enjoy enjoy!! My favorite is the manly meal and the egg white omelette. Good size portions and customer service."}
{"text":"I feel truly mislead by all the ratings I read on yelp for this place.  Service was great, so I don't want people to think that was the issue.  I got the famous omelette , and was truly disappointed.  There was no flavor, and the meat was dried out to the point of not being able to eat it.  It was so bad that I told my girlfriend that I would pick up the 45 dollar check if she could finish it.... she declined the offer.  The pancakes were dry and tasted over cooked.  Also the eggs Benedict  was sad.   The sauce was strictly butter, and no texture.   I hate to do this, but please avoid."}
{"text":"After our epic fail at Skinnyfats, we came here.  Our server ANDREW WAS AWESOME! Super friendly and attentive. I am giving them five stars because of his performance.  Everything was awesome. The ambience was like being in a beach place in California or your grandmas kitchen. You can write on the walls and there are aliens everywhere. Ask your server about the story behind that! Apparently the Morris family has a thing for the extra terrestrial!  All the staff was kind and attentive.  The food took awhile but it's because they make everything from scratch. And they are BUSY.  Number one complaint was how close the tables were to each other. This isn't a place for an intimidate breakfast.  But it is still fun and comfy.  The mimosas were very generous and free when you check in.  The food was awesome. The omelettes were HUGE AND FLUFFY AND STUFFED WITH TONS OF GOODIES.   We will definitely be back and tell all of our friends about it!   Thanks again Drew!"}
{"text":"This what would have otherwise been a good breakfast turned out to be not so good when I ordered pancakes and realized that the syrup provided was watered down and you had to pay a $2.49 up charge for maple syrup.  I find this practice to be absurd and will not be revisiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Squeeze in is in the northeast corner of the strip mall that has the Colonnade movie theater. If you don't have the directions, you will never find it. And that would be really too bad. Offering only breakfast and lunch they have a pretty extensive menu with some unusual items that you won't find elsewhere. This is my second time here. The first time I had the Spanish Flay omelet. Supposedly inspired by the celebrity chef. Really doesn't matter because this is a truly delicious omelette. Today I went with the Spacey Tracy omelet . Wow was that good. Loaded with bacon, lots of avocado, and lots of mushrooms. Even better than the Spanish Flay. I opted for a side of fruit rather than the potatoes that it comes with ( an extra dollar and a half - but worth it). My wife went with the chicken tacos on the under 500 calorie menu. Tasty but not great. But for a diet meal, quite good. The servers were both extremely nice and very attentive. It is decorated with a UFO motif. A little weird but definitely interesting."}
{"text":"The only thing that tops the food is the service! Menu items can be mixed and matched and the reward system for regulars is awesome. Check this spot out for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Place for breakfast all day! Right next to the movie theater, Squueze in had great breakfast foods and it looks to be a featured restaurant on Food Network and Travel Channel! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Andrew our waiter was fantastic hands down best customer service.  The Maggie is a must."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday morning and our server, a younger guy, was quite possibly the best server I've ever had. Extremely pleasant and attentive. I'm upset with myself for not getting his name so I could add it to this review. As for the food, the portions here are HUGE and definitely shareable. They have a gigantic menu and sure to have something for everyone. Great place to go for breakfast. I shared a half biscuits and gravy and an eggs Benny with my sister and we were unable to finish."}
{"text":"I was lured in by claims of having the \"best omelets on the planet!\"-- and they're actually pretty damn good. And at 4 large eggs each, they're also huge! I've rarely seen as much omelet variety on one menu as I do here, and it was hard to decide what to order.  My guy and I split the Racy Tracy omelet (mushrooms, bacon, and monterrey jack, topped with avocado, $15), which was stuffed with filling. The mushroom cream sauce complemented this well, and we upgraded our spuds to \"Otis style\" with cheese and grilled onions. The kitchen split our order and each portion was still enough that we didn't eat lunch!  Returned another day and shared a short stack of the Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes and the Bomb Shelter Bacon Benny- I'm not much of a pancake fan and these were decently fluffy but could have used more bananas and nuts, while the Benedict was delicious and packed with mushrooms and bacon. Again, so much food as to cover two meals, even sharing.   Location has kitschy road stop decor like their original location in Truckee, including Sharpie graffiti walls and a random bicycle hanging from the ceiling. Staff are super friendly and I like that the menu has substantial lunch dishes (burgers, salads, sandwiches), healthy (under 500 cal) and vegetarian-friendly options, unlike most places known for their breakfast dishes.  TIP: Sign up for their loyalty club online before you visit, and you'll get a $5 off coupon in the mail (which makes their prices considerably more reasonable), plus $10 on your birthday, and champagne on your anniversary! Check in on the Yelp app to get a free beverage or order of their chocolate bacon, too."}
{"text":"This place just opened 6 weeks ago.  Myself, my wife and sister-in-law had breakfast.  The manager Jenna greeted us once we arrived, Welcomed us and asked if this was our first time, which it was.  She helped us by explaining all the items on the menu.  The breakfast menu was loaded, there is something for everyone.  On the front of the menu it says, \"Best Omelettes on the Planet!\"  Outrageous Guarantee.  \"You'll love our food or it's FREE\" We each ordered an omelette I had the Hangover, 4 eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese.  The ladies had My Big Fat Greek Omelette, Red bell peppers, spinach, black olives, feta cheese and pesto.  The portion sizes are big, hot and delicious.  We also had an order of Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes.  Everything was delicious.  Our server, Amie who was very friendly gave us a sample of their chocolate bacon with cool whip, blue berries and strawberries ...OUTSTANDING.  The food was great, atmosphere and service were just as good. We left bellies full, smiles on our faces with left overs and a few souvenirs. Thanks to Jenna and Amie for treating us so well.  We will see them again very soon."}
{"text":"Slow as F*** service... however the food is good... she was kind enough to apologize for the 30 min wait for our order. Overall it's a cool place."}
{"text":"My family and I are fans of the original Squeeze in in Truckee and whenever we are in Reno we stop at that location as well. This one is just as good as the others. Our server, Andrew, was fantastic. The food was fresh and delicious. We will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was my first time coming here. The food was incredible! I got the egg white super food scramble! It was very good for being so healthy!   They gave me and my boyfriend our mimosas for a dollar each and they offer other specials as well for new comers. Well definitely be back!   Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place close to home. Wife and I both got the Chilaquiles. Super delicious big portions. Our server Krys was helpful and extremely nice. We will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and my wife and I loved it. Friendly and fast service, the jack Johnson banana pancakes were awesome and whatever my wife had was great too. They have toy baskets for kids and you get to write or draw on their wall (don't forget to like my ninja turtle in between the m/f bathroom).  Our only complaints were the random /uncomfortable chairs and their cheap and flimsy eating utensils.   Other than that, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love their Chorizo Benedict and that's what I've ordered for my first visit. Yay!  On my second visit, I asked my hubby to join me for breakfast. He ordered a Benedict and I totally forgot what mine was. All I remember was, there was no left over on my plate.  Try this new place and you'll love their food, service and the chillax vibe as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the rare times I leave a 5 star rating. Everything was 5 stars, service, food, cleanliness, and atmosphere. Nothing to improve my experience today and I will return."}
{"text":"Yep awesome.  I liked the place. It's keeps asking me to write more but I don't want too."}
{"text":"This place was really amazing! Very hip and bright, with a very charming menu. The staff was extremely fast and efficient. The food was to die for!!! A must try, if you're looking for a bomb breakfast and mimosa"}
{"text":"Squeeze in is definitely my favorite place to eat breakfast. The food is great my favorite is the queen maggie (stuffed French toast). The portions are huge. The service is outstanding Andrew & Dandy always go out of their way to make sure everyone is taken care of. Best food & service out of anywhere we've ever been."}
{"text":"Hmmm, well, I'm torn on this spot. There's goods and bads to it. Most importantly, only come here if you've got loads of time (particularly during breakfast/brunch on the weekend).  The Good: - The decor is cute and fun. It's all Vegas and a bit kitschy. I loved all the aliens. - Be sure to check-in on Yelp and get a free mimosa or bloody mary. (Good only for the standard mimosa and bloody mary. They do also have a top-shelf bloody mary and various mimosa flavors.) - The menu is very plentiful. So many options to choose from! - The wait wasn't nearly as long as we thought it would be. - The portions are sizable. - The potatoes are particularly yum. - The servers were friendly. - When someone finally asked how everything was (after we were already done eating), my friend made a face. This resulted in an apology from the guy, an apology from our server, and a discount on our bill. None of that was necessary and was definitely a sign of care and good service.  The So-So and Bad: - One of our mimosas took over 30 mins to get. They clearly had just forgotten about it. - Yes, everyone at our table checked in on Yelp and obnoxiously redeemed the Yelp check-in offer. But they still tried to charge two of us for our drinks. - We were asked what kind of toast we wanted, but it was never actually served with our meals. And no one even came by to check on us after food had arrived - so there was no one to tell. - It took 10 mins to get silverware. No, for real. And that was only when we got up and physically walked over to where the place settings were kept. - We were asked what special sauce we wanted (they offer three kinds) and those were never served either. And again, no one checked on us, so we couldn't even ask about them. - Our food was ok, but not amazing. And while that's not really a bad thing, considering everything else so-so/bad, the food sorta needs to make up for it. - It was a really lengthy dining experience. Again, not necessarily a bad thing at all. But when the service is so lacking and you're missing items... Well, it makes it less of an enjoyable long experience. - I thought the Spanish Flay was lacking in flavor. The potatoes in the omelette were under-cooked. And the bacon I paid to add-in was pretty much raw. Not appetizing.  Hmmm, so maybe, just maybe, this spot would be better on a non-weekend day? Maybe there are better menu items? I wouldn't be opposed to giving this spot another shot. But I'd probably avoid another weekend brunch trip."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, I haven't had to ask for anything because of his excellent initiative,he just filled my water glass as I was typing this, point taken. The food is literally mouth-watering good. The aroma that welcomes you, when they set the food down, is unbelievably satisfying. Let's not forget the chill vibe that surrounds you while you dine. A must try!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent !!! The pancakes were huge!! The mimosas were perfect !! All the kids were happy with their food that's always a plus for a parent! And again did I mention the mimosa was divine"}
{"text":"Squeeze In is my favorite! Talia is the bomb the bomb dot com. Every time I come in she makes fantastic recommendations and my tummy is always satisfied!"}
{"text":"So, this is my favorite breakfast spot in Las Vegas! The food is great, servers are friendly and very helpful...and the best Bloody Mary's in town!!! Third weekend in a row that we've come back! I highly recommend this place!!! Andrew is awesom"}
{"text":"have been here a few times now. it b.s. been consistent  every time. great fresh food, fun atmosphere,  and always great service. portions are Hugh!"}
{"text":"I believe it was the Hawaiian one it had cream cheese jallepenio peppers ham etc.  I recently took my daughter and her girl friend while they were in town and they too loved their food and experience...thanks"}
{"text":"The menu is pretty straightforward in misleading you to believe that this place is anything but an average at best breakfast place. If your \"stoned out of their mind\" waiter can manage to remember your order, or more importantly that you're even there, you have a fair shot at having your unremarkable food pile in a reasonable time frame. This is the sort of place that I USED to eat at, before I cared about how I spent my money or learned what a nice brunch is."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you died and went to breakfast heaven, this place is for you!  Not greasy Enormous portions - warning! Buy one dish for 2 people and if still hungry, buy another unless you want to maintain your obesity. Then buy two.   Everything tastes fresh and delicious, not frozen premade garbage  Good prices for the quality and amount  Super cute happy environment and music  Very nice fast service  There is only one place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We came to eat breakfast on Sunday morning and had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, which is expected for a weekend breakfast but the food was amazing!!!! Our server Andrew was also very friendly and attentive. Thanks Andrew! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to have breakfast or lunch!  People and food are fantastic!  Please do yourself a favor and go by for breakfast or lunch!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely the hot spot right now! Jam packed on a Sunday morning, line out the door, but worth the wait! Had a great Benedict & the atmosphere was super fun!! The hubs had a burger with great flavor & the uncle had vegetable soup with a sandwich. Fresh & Fab! Want to try the French toast next time since that was a dish everyone seemed to be ordering! Great service & accommodating in every way!!"}
{"text":"Simply fabulous breakfast! The omelette was amazing with the fluffiest eggs I've ever tasted. Be prepared to wait as the space is limited but it's well worth it. The customer service is second to none as well. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Dandy, my server was spectacular. The Hostess was very personable and I completely forgot her name but she was fantastic. The omelette wrapped in a flour tortilla is a really nice touch. Flavors we're outstanding. HANDS DOWN; JACK JOHNSONS BANANA WALNUT PANCAKES!!! A must have!!! I'm a plane Jane guy but these were to die for. My only suggestion is that I felt like I was eating Aunt Jemimas syrup and not some real Vermont maple syrup. I could be wrong as I did not ask what type of syrup it was. It would have been a 4.5 due to which syrup but since I can only rate 4 or 5 it has to be a 4. Honestly the flavor the service and ambiance all stellar!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service as always. Don't miss this cool breakfast restaurant that encourages you to draw on the walls. Huge portions!"}
{"text":"Go here.  Chorizo Benedict was very creative and  I enjoyed every bite!   Our friend ordered the Chocolate covered bacon... Served with whip cream, blueberries & strawberries.  It was the most unusual creation I have tasted in years.  If you are adventurous and eat meat, even occasionally, try it.   I also tasted the pancakes and they were just right!   Great, Great Waiter... He was helpful, gave good advice and was available for anything we needed.   Lemonade is tart and sweet.    They have some kind of a sign up which gives you $5 for next time and $10 on your birthday.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What can I say, another great place to have breakfast. The place is fun and the food is delicious. Had a scramble with bacon and sausage and crispy potatoes, with fruit. So good and the fruit was ripe. They have 2 locations. Going to the other location closer to my house with Jeromy on Friday. Can't wait to share my find!"}
{"text":"After trying this place on the east side of town I thought I'd give them a try closer to home. Can't say enough about this place. Go! Have breakfast or lunch you won't be disappointed. I promise. The place is fun the service excellent and the food is oh so yummy!!"}
{"text":"If you're on a diet, you may want to steer clear. Not many healthy options. If you want a naughty breakfast like mom used to make for dinner when she was feeling a bit daring, by all means hit up Squeeze In. Super friendly staff. The omelettes are huge... and then you get potatoes and a bread with the special too. Oh my. Even with a doggie bag I just felt lethargic when I was done. Be prepated to take a nap. Oh... And join the Egghead club. They give you free stuff."}
{"text":"Great place to go and have breakfast or brunch. Love coming here for breakfast with the family. There Zweifel is highly recommended if you are looking for different.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and our server Tina was very attentive. The portions were pretty big so you are not getting out of there with an empty stomach!   It's a big expensive but all the perks they are giving you, it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant in Reno!  Service staff was awesome. Went today to this location and after finally being sat we were provided drinks right away. After my second cup of coffee the waitress walks by my husband and I and says be right with you. Goes to other tables to check on them. Then goes to a six top who had just been sat and proceeds to take their order. By now I'm on my third cup of coffee.  We left. Too many choices around there.  Shame because the one in Reno was great. Can't comment on the food... never had a chance to try."}
{"text":"Another bookmark unchecked   With so many popular brunch spots in town, its hard to get to them all. This ones been on my list for awhile, first thought...this place is definitely different in a very good way.   Upon entry your greeted by a nice 4 foot tall alien figure..yup! Say hello  then as you walk in you realize just how unique this place is. Let's start by the writing on the wall..literally, there is writing all over every wall. Want to add your mark? The sharpies are at the front desk...tag away. Now onto the decor, let's talk about complete randomness...snowboards, Elvis pics, more aliens, a curtain to the kitchen that's definitely from the 50's. Its awesome at how unique this place is.   Let's move on to selecting your seat. Every table and chair is different! Yup! Talk about shopping for things that don't match at all. It's like they went to every garage sale they could find, bought one piece and creatively decided to use it as peice in the restaurant. I LOVED how the tables/chairs were all mismatched.   Service, 5 stars! You definitely got the small family owned feeling with how attentive, friendly, down to earth the people were. It wasn't the robotic greeting, suggestive selling, touching the table and exit.   As for the food, I had the So Cal Low Cal and the alfalfa sprouts were a very nice touch.  They have a few celebrity chef created items so I'll be sure to try it next time."}
{"text":"Person #1: great place I will definitely come back again...love the coffee.    Person #2: Basically the employees here are awesome, I have to say I've had to order a few mimosas from the anxiety that's flowing in the air. The pressure of having to order in less than 30 seconds is real! #LA #Natives"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Friday for our first time and we had Cassie as our sever. She was so professional and nice, we experienced great customer service by her. The food was amazing! Very fresh and delicious! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't give too many 5 star reviews, but this place earned it yesterday.   It's a small location, and it was busy when I arrived. I was greeted promptly and my name was taken down. They have a small waiting area. I was seated after about 5 minutes.   Their menu has both breakfast and lunch items. I'm not a big breakfast fan (don't shoot) so I opted for lunch special. It was a spicy burger and fries.   BONUS -- They have alcohol! Yes, Baileys and coffee goes well with a burger.   The burger was HUGE. It tasted awesome. You could tell it was made fresh and the veggies were fresh too. It was a beast and yes, I destroyed it. It came with a large side of fries.   The staff was SUPER FRIENDLY. Every person I encountered was nice, genuine and helpful. You can tell it's a team effort there.   See Ya soon Squeeze In!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week on a Sunday. Great laid back spot with amazing friendly customer service. I ordered the eggs Benedict and thought they were amazing ! Give the French toast with cream cheese and bananas and strawberries a try too ! Also they have great drinks and a loyalty customer program card. The only glitch we had was the server gave us the wrong bill but she promptly corrected and there were no other problems. Highly recommend this as a great Las Vegas local ( and all visitors to Vegas )  brunch and lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I have always had my eye on Squeeze In. In the same small shopping area think just about been to every restaurant. Breakfast and Lunch spot always peaks my  interest. On this day after full brick workout for triathlon training. I was in need of hearty breakfast/lunch. Squeeze In was the perfect spot!! One that see many more recovery meals in my future.   One of the first things that stood out is the alien out front or the chicken chalkboard with the specials of the day. I was thinking (cause this was my first visit) something that see along famous Route 66. I never been just fyi. Once walk in got that total vibe plus whole lot more of everything. Different writing on the walls, vinyl cover albums, and just straight up melting pot of personality everywhere you look. I LOVE it!!! The personality not stop from the minute you walk in the front door. They welcome you with open arms, warm greeting, and definitely get the whole family run business vibe from the workers. The menu talk about personality from the different names for most part every dish. The sandwich I got if want break it down club sandwich they call \"Beautiful Bonnie\". The random alien in the menu. lol. Colorful menu, few pictures of the food, and alcohol list (not often see decent one at breakfast/lunch spot). The kitchen bottles old school in plastic bottle just one color red. Old school diner vibe throw that one in the mix.   The food like mention went with the \"Beautiful Bonnie\". It truly was Beautiful!!!! The thing that for starter stood out nothing fancy about it but just look hearty, healthy, and hell of good. The waitress asked if wanted three or two pieces of bread. Tradition got go with three. Talk about lot of carbs. The thing that made this club stand out as the best one ever had in life. Not only just the freshness of all the ingredients. Adding the thin slice of carrots. It gave the club different texture. Crunch. Combine it with classic turkey (that add on), alfalfa sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo (they ask if want it or not). No bacon in it. It nice REFRESHING sandwich and really the best recovery sandwich any endurance athlete needs post workout. I got fries or could substitute soup of the day. Waitress recommended garlic fries instead. I was like first time why not. It was pretty solid. Not over the top with the garlic but just the right amount. I wanted bowl of soup so got the clam chowder. It was ok.   I definitely will be back to try some of the breakfast items. I saw some of the pancakes coming out of the kitchen. They were looking really good. The french toast that just looks like da bomb. They have breakfast club program. Free. I signed up. It takes less five minutes and worth five minutes especially if plan on coming back. They have yelp check in get free drink! The good kine alcohol one!!!!   The service is five stars without doubt. Everyone is super friendly, and it was my first time the upgrade with the garlic fries good call. I would never think about if my waitress not mention it."}
{"text":"Squeeze In is one of my new favorite spots. Not only is the food amazing the service is too. Squeeze In is welcoming and inviting.   Allie is one of my favorite servers. She always is so sweet, so accommodating and always willing to go the extra step to make every time I am at Squeeze In, an enjoyable experience.   The mimosas are amazing and in a bigger glass, not your regular champagne flute!   The menu has incredible options!   Do yourself a favor and try it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations when I dined in.  I atmosphere is different.  There is a lot of art and writing from past guests on the walls.  Interesting reading and gives you something to do besides have your face in your phone.  The breakfast menu was quite large.  We took the suggestions from the waitress.  The food was good."}
{"text":"Glad this place has a vegan and vegetarian menu option. The potatoes were excellent and the service spot on. I'll be returning here for my breakfast."}
{"text":"Great  Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes and omelette!!! Everything was great actually! Superb service and avacado was fresh! My new breakfast spot!!!"}
{"text":"Had the tuna sandwich--they use albacore tuna and not much mayonnaise (perfect amount just to hold it together) also added avocado and alfalfa sprouts. Husband had the bacon mushroom burger and avocado and he really liked it. Server was great and very good service."}
{"text":"I want to give 4.5 stars, but still to this day, Yelp does not allow half stars which is beyond idiotic.  We were sat pretty quickly (15 minutes or so) and enjoyed a great brunch.  Service was super friendly, and the menu is quite large and was filled with various things I wanted to give a try.  I ended up with some French toast, which had berries and was very good...rich but tasty.  Overall, a great breakfast along with a ton of other super good looking choices for future returns makes my return guaranteed.  Prices were reasonable as well.  Since I had a solid experience all the way around, I will round up to 5 *."}
{"text":"Well .... service was great, friendly and helpful ... We would need to try other items .... but not sure  .... I had searched breakfast in the area with food intolerance ingredients  ... such as gluten, soy, wheat, and dairy FREE .... we wouldn't really categorize the restaurant under the options mentioned above. BUT if you don't have food intolerance  .... hey try this place."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place. Love the whole theme of the restaurant, and the food was really tasty too! They have a lot of vegetarian options which is much appreciated, and had no issue substituting any meats for extra veggies. Also the service was great!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little breakfast/lunch place. Always has very good service but the food is not good at all. It's food taste like frozen meals you buy at the store and it's never fresh."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the food was excellent! Kris, our waitress, was awesome! Would love to eat here again next weekend!"}
{"text":"Best new breakfast place to go to. Food was delicious and huge portion. Come hungry. Staff were all nice and friendly. Well recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and a wide variety. The crab omelette is really good. Sounded weird at first but it was surprisingly delicious"}
{"text":"I had the King Crab Benny and it was delicious ! The owner welcomed us in which is an absolute must if you love what you do in this industry . I highly recommend this establishment.....great job !!!"}
{"text":"Five star menu, food, decor & service!! Wow what a hidden gem!? Our first time here and we loved everything Squeeze In!!! Frankie was such a great server!! Great experience in every way!! The food was not only very unique but so so delicious!! We cannot wait to come back and try some new items!! I'd highly recommend this place to everyone in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars for a number of reasons. I came here with a meetup group on a Sunday around 11 am. The place was busy yet they made sure we were accommodated. We had to wait a little for tables to clear so that all 13 of us could sit together, and they were nice enough not to grumble about us wanting separate checks. The food was very good and I don't think anyone had anything negative to say, and we all said that we would come back at some point in time. I am excited to bring my Parents here next time they are in town. I had The Sarge omelet. It had thin-sliced pastrami and melted cheddar cheese. The pastrami was PERFECT! Not salty, not dry. I had cheese added to my potatoes and they were also excellent. I will be back for sure and I would recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Ok so I used to absolutely love this place and was a regular, even though I didn't remember to check in every time... But holy geezuz. I mean they can't even cook their potatoes right anymore. You ask for them a little crispy and you get them over cooked, uneatable. You don't ask for your fries well done and you get soggy nasty fries. DO NOT EVER ORDER THEIR WAY OVER PRICED BLT at this place! So I added avocado and garlic to my soggy undercooked fries, huge mistake on our now $forty something dollar breakfast! I knew I should've drove to Boulder City for my perfect BLTA for $7.99 and their $6 bloody Mary's with awesome bacon! So at Squeeze In you get 2 thin soggy slices of bacon, old mushy tomatoes, dirty lettuce, a dollop of mayo on your thick untoasted bread! What a joke! And not to mention I got the top nub of the avocado in my sandwich! Good thing I didn't choke on it! What a horrible experience. Oh and their nasty \"top shelf bloody Mary's\" are a waste of money! Way too much vodka and no flavor! Just vodka! Ack! I'm over this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered take out. The omelette was tasty and the potatoes with cheese and onions hit the spot. Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Excellent!! Service from our server Andrew.  Guy was awesome, very polite and came to check on us often.  Food was delicious and filling.   Will be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Excellent food, large portions and great service. Nothing more I can add. Will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My sister told me about this spot and I have been here about 5 times since then. They give large portions, the banana pancakes are huge!! The food always comes out hot and delicious. The servers are all awesome and they remember us when we come in. My husband and brother had the cheeseburger for lunch and they loved it. My brother is a cook at a very well known restaurant so he is very picky but very pleased. Try this place out if your in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu with an eclectic choice and variety.  I started with their Bloody Mary and we shared the Racy Tracy.  We are not the biggest eaters and knew their portions are huge.  But they have this great option for only $1.99 they bring you all of the set-up items, like toast and potatoes for the two sharing a dish.  This was perfect as we don't agree on bread, etc but the omellet was perfect.  Even the coffee was good.  The place is not cheap, $13.95 for any omlet is on the high side especially for the part of town it is in.  The decor was fun, the service was exceptional, thank you Allie.  We had to wait for a table and I suspect that is quite normal on the weekends.  The place is not that big but obviously word got out because it is not easy to find even when you are in the parking lot.  Back corner.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place... on a not so busy Thursday.. service a bit sluggish..... best biscuit and gravy in las vegas.... excellent fresh biscuit... fantastic diverse menu... so many tempting dishes..... its in the corner of a plaza so you have to know where it is... but overall very good spot"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.    Can't ask for much more.     From the hostess to our server Krys.     Definitely our new breakfast and lunch spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very pleased to find what we now consider another breakfast hot spot!  Very impressive and creative menu with quality ingredients.  You can tell right away after walking past a few dishes on other peoples tables that you're in for a good time.  We were not disappointed, loved our breakfast and are already looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! It's a bit small but we came on a Sunday around 1 so no wait at all. They have so many things to choose from and even a vegan side. Everyone is so nice and they have really cool stuff all around. You can even write on the walls!! They have a good selection of alcoholic drinks as well.  I got the griller which is on the vegan side and it was amazing. The garlic fries are sooo good. Overall I am very happy with this pace will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast & lunch spot. Unique concept where they provide you with sharpies to write everywhere on their walls! Food portions were huge and tasty. Even the kids menu served large portions, so definitely recommended sharing if possible.  Loved that offered breakfast alcohol! And if you check-in, you'll receive 50% any alcoholic drink! Staff was very friendly and courteous!"}
{"text":"Love this quaint, local spot in summerlin! We had great, spicy Bloody Mary's that had a heavy pour. The food was excellent, I had a twice baked scramble which was awesome. My friend had banana pancakes which were my favorite thing we ate. The service was awesome, Amy J was super attentive and considerate. Well come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent new breakfast place! We had the stuffed French toast and crab omelet. They were both super yummy! It's a little pricey for breakfast but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for awhile and sooo glad I did!!  The food was sooo good! Our lovely Krys was fast and efficient, she deserves the 5 stars very clean , excellent service, and good homemade food"}
{"text":"great breakfast spot, the food was awesome, no wait and the staff was perfect. we will be back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is our forth time here and always thought it was great until we came with more people, a total of 6 in our party. The service was terrible, we ordered the 1/2 pound king crab Benedict and was told we were given less because they only had frozen? We were like what? They offered us free juice for our compensation since we didn't drink alcoholic beverages. Two of our other dishes didn't come out until the rest of the party was done eating, they forgot to put it in. We weren't compensated for that.   It's unfortunate that this place has gone down, the food isn't amazing it's sub par. We come here because it's close and convenient. So for groups more than 4, don't bother coming."}
{"text":"We lived in Reno for a number of years and went to Squeeze-In at least once a month for breakfast. The food is amazing, large portions and well prepared, attentive waitstaff and truly...the bottomless cup of coffee.  The vibe here is fun and like a page out of Santa Cruz or Berkeley. Learning that they had opened in Vegas made us happy."}
{"text":"Told our wait would be 15 min and it ended up being 45, finally sat down and got our drink order taken 15 min after being seated. Server took orders from the tables around us that were seated after us, I finally got up to say something and here the server came. Ordered our food and asked for a water refill, got our food and asked for a water refill .... ate our food and still had an empty glass. The lady came over took our dishes away and we sat there for another 20 minuets before I finally asked someone for our bill.   Food was okay nothing special we'll stick to our normal place.   Costumer recommendation: have more then one server. There was at least 5 people working and most of the time they were standing at the food window talking and messing around when their work wasn't being done."}
{"text":"Several months ago I met the male owner and at that time I thought he was a jerk.  Prior I had gone several times and the food was okay. The server Andrew is the only asset to this location .  Last week I received a Birthday card informing me that I was to receive $10 off a meal.  Today I decided to use the card.  Well I ordered their  eggs bennedict with bacon. The waitress was training another gal so it took a little longer. Since I know they serve their breakfast potatoes hotter than any other breakfast restaurant I asked for a little sour cream.  The meal came and there was a tablespoon of sour cream.  The food was soso.  When I was finished eating and ready to pay my bill I got out the birthday card and my Squeeze in member card along with my credit card. I watched as different servers walked my card, receipt credit card around the restaurant. Not a good feeling then I  was told their computer had crashed.  Finally after 15 min the server brought my card and the receipts for me to sign.  Would you believe they charged me $.79 for the sour cream.  That is just so dumb.  I will not be returning anytime soon .  NO WHERE ELSE HAVE I BEEN CHARGED FOR A TABLESPOON OF SOUR CREAM.  I wonder what they charge for ketchup or mustard  think before you eat there  there are a lot of great breakfast restaurants in Vegas.   Oh by the way The potatoes burned the roof of my mouth"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. It's fun, creative, & delicious! The atmosphere is incredible along with the service. I got the crab omelet and it's bomb!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have  been a die hard fan since the second store in Reno opened. So happy to see that they are in Las Vegas now!  The food is always great and people are always friendly."}
{"text":"First off, big shout out to our server Allie.  She greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked through the door.  She was very friendly and had a great sense of humor.  Other servers could definitely learn from her!  Pros:  tasty food, big portions, nice setting that has a quirky alien theme to it ( which appeals to me since I believe in ETs, but that's another story), friendly workers and convenient location  Cons:  nothing really but they are only open until 2pm  Don't normally give out 5 stars but I really enjoyed it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My neighborhood breakfast spot. Funky and unique with random junk on the walls and ceiling. Buckets of toys for the kids, pancake fluff on point, breakfast burrito with salsa hit the spot!   Lots of parking and friendly good service. Bonus- delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"I'm actually feeling bad about writing this review because for the past year this has been my go-to spot for weekend breakfast (and quite a few weekday lunches, too!). The Squeeze In is conveniently close, offer a great variety of breakfast and lunch, mimosas and Bloody Mary's are poured with a little extra \"love\" (read:  strong), and the servers (Kim, Krys, Andrew and the rest of the gang) are awesome folks - super friendly and they take such good care of me. It's like Cheer's with food - everyone knows you and they treat you like family.  They have a great frequent diner program (Egg-head) which provides $10 off certificates, free drinks, and other specials to say thanks.   In the past the food was super tasty with overly generous portions and consistent predictability. I knew what to expect when I ordered, and I knew it was going to taste good.  However, in the last 90 days or so it's been going downhill and the last couple of times it's just been so meh...  The server team is always SO awesome about trying to fix it that I always go back.  They've redone my food, they've given me discounts, they've given me a coupon for a discount next time, they've given me a piece of chocolate bacon.  All I really want though  is a good plate of food, and for the food to arrive so we can all eat together.   Maybe it's just hope that eventually the kitchen will get their act together and it'll be back to the great place I enjoyed so much, but after my visit today I'll have to think long and hard about going back.  I ordered an omelet with chorizo, cheese, jalapeño and avocado. When I cut into the omelet, the inside hadn't cooked and the egg came running out all over the plate. This wasn't slightly undercooked - it was pure liquid!  The server saw it immediately took it to be remade - not even a question asked - she saw it and took it away (yes - great service!).  When the next omelet returned it was fully cooked, but just bad.  I don't know where the toppings were but there was so little cheese in this one that I couldn't find it, over half of the omelet had no meat inside, and there were more jalapeños inside than all of Mexico. Basically - it was a solid sheet of scrambled egg and jalapeño with fresh avocado on top.   My recommendation is to try it yourself. Maybe it's been just bad luck lately.  After all, when you visit the same place as often as I go to the Squeeze In it's bound to happen that the kitchen makes a mistake - no ones perfect.    Keep your eyes peeled - if I head back I'll update the review and let you know how things turn out."}
{"text":"The menu is absolutely great! There is a such a great variety of items on the menu that you can have a great breakfast, brunch or lunch! The menu even has stuff on it that would be better for dinner! LOL! Which brings me to dinner: Please talk to the franchise owners about staying open until 8pm on weekdays and 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights. I would be there for dinner once a week if you could change the hours!!! With my schedule I can only make it there for breakfast or lunch on weekends.  Please make it happen!"}
{"text":"I'm not kidding when I tell you this is thee best breakfast I've ever had in 44 years!!!!  Portions are grand, service was excellent and the atmosphere is fun and busy!!!!  I love it and will be back often!  Suggest the strawberry banana cream cheese stuffed French toast!"}
{"text":"What a cute little gem! A must try! Fabulous breakfast! Good food! Fun service. Great staff!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. My first time here, the food was great and the drinks were delicious (my favorite is the Hi-Mosa). My third time here, it was completely slammed. Almost every table was full, there was only two cooks in the kitchen and two severs who also had to balance ringing out guests. Being that it was so slammed, my boyfriend and I completely understood the longer wait time for our food and saw how hard the girls were working. But they still went above and beyond to take care of us and unnecessarily apologized for everything. We told them we understood how busy they were but they still took that extra step to make sure we were happy. This is definitely a place I'll be returning to much more and recommending to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"Cute open space cafe with a ton of food on the menu. They serve breakfast and lunch all day. The bloody Mary's were awesome and we got half off with the yelp coupon so make sure to use that. The food was great as well. They give you a ton of food for a good price. My girlfriend and I each had a drink and an omelet and it was about $20 each.  Four stars because we couldn't figure out who our waiter was and the food took almost 30 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant I've ever been to! I appreciate the incredible service and more importantly the incredible food!   I'm so glad to see that Squeeze came to Las Vegas!!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazingly friendly staff! I wish I lived closer and could eat there often. Go in and try the French dip with grilled onion and avocado. Soo good!!! Free cocktail if you check in too. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place is always busy especially on the weekends so expect a wait. Don't come here hangry.  The menu had a big selection of breakfast (and lunch) items. Really big portions too. I got the Steff's Mess-scrambled eggs mixed up with spinach, onions, cheese with chorizo, served with spudz and toast. I had enough leftovers for the next two days!!!  If you get a chance, take a look at their menu available online....you're bound to find something that will satisfy your taste buds.   Don't forget to check in for a 50% off alcoholic beverage offer."}
{"text":"Had a purchased a groupon to try this place out. Food was not too bad, very different ambiance. Staff were all friendly but it was a tad busy that day and they were a little slow. Food Prices were more on the pricey end, but everything came out the way we wanted!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! I went here for the first time today for brunch and I couldn't have been more pleased. Our server, Tina, could not have been better and gave us great recommendations and was very attentive. Check in for the free mimosa and sign up for their rewards program! As a vegetarian, they had plenty of options and the Chadillac was awesome! I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today and I highly recommend it.  Their portions are very generous and everything my husband and I had tasted delicious.  The decor in the resteraunt is very eclectic and fun.  We will most Definately be returning again next time we will give lunch a try.  I'm sure it will not disappoint either!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to trying this place since the overall review average is good and it's close to where we live. Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and had to walk out. I don't see how so many people can give this place anything higher than 3 stars. When we walked in I liked the decor but it was considerably empty considering it's a Sunday. We were greeted and seated.....that was the best part.....the servers all had a I'm to tired to be here vibe and were not very prompt about getting our order and refilling coffee and tea, keep in mind there were two other working tables in there with us and about 4 servers wondering around. The food also took longer than it should have considering the lack of patrons. The food arrived and it looked sad. The potatoes were cold, soggy and my eggs Benedict was supposed to have mushrooms sautéed in wine but instead were cold and uncooked and the bacon was hard burnt crumbles. My wife's omelette was cooked hard and was dry and tasteless . Whom ever was cooking had no idea how to cook and there is no one checking to make sure the food looks right before going to the customer. If you are someone with a developed palette and cares about integrity and passion then this place is not for you. We left and went to mr. mamas...they were slammed and delivered an awesome breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Loved it, loved it!  Food was amazing, great serving size, great taste. Thank you Chelsea for creating an incredible experience, very helpful and super friendly.  We will definitely be going back. Good place for kids."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I feel kind of ripped off.  Took my daughter for brunch today and we were far from impressed.  First, we had to wait ten minutes for a table when there were at least three free.  We were not alone having to wait.  It seems that all tables have wait about ten minutes even when plenty are free.  Altogether, we were in the restaurant for 90+ minutes which is 30 minutes too long.    Now the food.  The menu can be confusing, and a couple tables next to us were struggling to decide what they wanted.  I think the pancakes and waffles have potential, but our omelettes were simply not good.  I got the Spanish Flay and it was bland.  2/3 of the plate was potatoes and inside the dish it was 90% potatoes.  They ask if you want a sauce and I selected their \"cheese\" sauce.  It was a side of nacho cheese.  Not what I was expected for this price.  My daughter had The Biggest Little Omelette which has shrimp.  The entire dish had two shrimp in it.  Literally.   It was also very bland.  The place really seemed to be struggling.  Two of three tables next to us had some sort of comp due to issues.  One table was almost done eating before one of them got their food.  We elected not to complain as we were just sick of sitting.    Now my biggest issue.  For two meals and two drinks (soda, not alcohol) my check was $39.  Seriously?  That much for brunch food in Vegas?    Maybe we will come back and try again in a few months when the dust settles.  For now, we will continue to go to Truffles and Bacon in the same shopping center.  We find their food is much better and more reasonable.  In addition, Egg Works runs circles around this place."}
{"text":"Amazing, food is absolutely outstanding! Great service and everything. Music is awesome who doesn't like good music while stuffing your face? Jo did an amazing job!!"}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews saying that the environment and the decor of the restaurant is eye popping and stands out from other restaurants.   I arrived at Squeeze In and was able to get a table while waiting for my friend. My friend ended being late for brunch so I ended waiting at the table for about 20 minutes. Waiting gave me an opportunity to browse through their menu with as it had plenty of options to choose from. I eventually ended up ordering before my friend got there, but it was nice not to feel rushed into ordering while I sat there for a good moment.  I ordered the \"Racy Tracy\" as it was featured on the first page and caught my eye. When my friend came she ordered the same thing. The meal that came out matched the picture. The portions were huge and it was a struggle to finish. We also ordered a pitcher of of their House Mimosa. Be cautious as it is accurate to its description and feels like there is only a splash of orange juice.  There have a rewards programs that we both signed up for. We were told they have special promotions where on certain days you can earn more than other days. Birthday and Anniversary promotions were also included in signing up for the program.   Will be back to try some other things off of the menu. Definitely worth trying out this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a egghead. .  This is a cute place, everyone was nice food was fresh and great.  Derive was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Omg... Like omg... This place has the best mimosas! Mimosas by the pitcher? Yes please. So a pitcher of mimosas is 2 bottles of champagne and a splash of orange juice. I'm in love .   This place is truly hidden. Like no body puts baby in the corner hidden . Literally in the back corner of a strip mall next to a vegan place. The deco is sharpie o. A yellow back ground. They give you sharpies to autograph the walls. I'm guessing they already know they won't be getting that deposit back lol.   So we had it all and shared. We had the breakfast burrito, the pancakes, the French toast, and the hangover. Everything was soooooo good. I can't pick which one is better."}
{"text":"It was by the grace of a friend's recommendation that I came across this place and I'm really glad I did. This location is fairly new with another one on Fort Apache. The restaurant is hidden in the back corner of a plaza so it's hard to spot if you don't know about it.  One of my biggest pet peeves with breakfast/brunch restaurants is the majority have tiny portions that never leave you satisfied regardless of taste. This place doesn't have that problem. The portions are absolutely massive and delicious. I ordered the 1/4 pound King Crab Eggs Benedict which was outstanding. It came with an equally massive portion of breakfast potatoes. My gf had one of the signature omelettes that she wasn't even able to make a dent in. We also split the jack johnson pancakes which was probably a mistake in hindsight lol. It was only two pancakes but so enormous we managed only a few bites. My only complaint is the pancakes were a little too fluffy. Personally I've always liked thinner pancakes because fluffy ones make you feel the bad kind of full.  Currently the Eastern location has a bottomless mimosa special for $15 everyday so I would definitively take advantage of that. Overall everything about this place and our brunch was outstanding, including our server Melissa."}
{"text":"Came here straight from NYC after arriving at 9am Vegas time and has two hungry teenagers. California omelette Raci Tracey was the bomb and banana pancakes were worth it even for those who are usually Paleo highly recommend ! Gets crowded on weekend Morning come early if possible"}
{"text":"Our first time to eat here and it won't be our last! Portions are huge. Andrew our server was awesome. They really have great customer service. I had the Spanish Benny and it was great. My husband had the Nebraska Rae. He was good too. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The employees are very nice. Water and coffee refilled quickly. Attentive service. Family friendly.  Just a \"heads up\" on the \"value\" of the Omelets: was told they are 4 egg omelets, but mine looked like the size of a two-egg one (so two of the eggs must have been quail eggs). My omelet was $12.99. I WAS expecting a much larger egg creation than the one I received. ALSO, you'll get only ONE peice of toast. The potatoes were the best part of the meal...though I only had a few bites, because I was looking forward to a large omelet. My omelet dimensions were 6 inches by 3 inches...and not a fluffy 6x3. The omelet was tasty, but seriously, it was NOT 4 regular sized eggs. I was also expected the veggies to be mixed into the eggs and then stuffed with the melted jack cheese (with a little on top)...very skimpy on the cheese, it was more like a \"suggestion\" of cheese. The veggies were sautéed and then the eggs folded around them.  So if you're looking for a \"light\" choice on the menu, choose the omelet. However, don't think you'll order the omelet with any intention of feeling full.   Lastly, on the wall (under the Elvis picture) there is this writing: \"Write on YELP, get a black eye.\" I asked if that was a cocktail (as a reward for writing about them on YELP). Nope...no \"black eye\" cocktail.   Maybe \"black eye\" is some sort of \"other\" reward?"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. You will have a hard time finding a better breakfast joint. The food was fun and creative,  and the service (Andrew) was great."}
{"text":"I fell in with the place and people working right away.  Staff cluld not have been warmer and welcoming!  Food was great tasting, huge menu, good prices."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots. Their portions are huge and the quality is there. Although I'm not a big fan of breakfast sandwiches, I love theirs. It's called The Garth Breakfast Sandwich. It is very flavorful and not too greasy. I choose fresh fruit for the side. Most places will just give you a few apple slices and grapes. Theirs was a variety of fruits and a generous portion. I also ordered their Sophia's Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes. I choose bananas and boy was it yummy. Normally I would expect them to be bland, but these weren't. I didn't expect the portions to be that big so it was a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to try more items off their menu!"}
{"text":"Great find. Andrew knew his sh**. The food and service was A-1. The Garth with avo and tomatowas the best. The only bad thing is we live 400 miles away."}
{"text":"First time visit, great service from Jenna and the staff, the food hit the spot.  Definitely coming back.  I hope they open up a spot in the NW."}
{"text":"My third time eating here and I still love this place.. I finally had the King Crab omelet OMG!! The sweet crab meat with Jack cheese and fresh avocado was amazing.. My daughter had the twice baked scramble and added spinach and grilled onions.. She had the same thing before and ate every last bite..  We indulged a little and started with 3 strips of the Chocolate covered bacon with sliced strawberries, whipped cream and blueberries Wow!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it's still amazing!!! We came super early (right after work since we're night owls) our server Jo was the sweetest! Our food came out fast, hot and delicious!   We started with their top shelf bloody Marys, then  I had the king crab Benedict, my husband got the bomb bacon Benny. We shared a side of blueberry pancakes.  We just left and I can't wait to go back!   Once again great servers!! Loved our girl Jo!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new breakfast spot to try off the strip and this one just opened up! Went here this past Sunday with the fam and were in no way disappointed!    Wife and I are seafood lovers and had to get the Holy Crab omelette. I had mine with the Tomato Pesto sauce and my wife had it plain. Very good and full of crab, not imitation but REAL crab! Our son had a cheese burger and that was very good! His bench mark for cheese burgers is the one from Kitchen Table. To him, it was close and that was all he wanted it to be. My parents were there so I got taste a few other things that they had on the menu.  Dad had the pancakes which were a really good size and about a 1/4 smaller than the pancakes that they serve at Hash House a Go Go. Flavorful and fluffy.  Mom had the Amanda Panda which was more tastier than I had thought. The turkey inside was grilled and seasoned which equals delicious. Then my aunt had the B.L.T.Ruckee Sandwich. This was very flavorful and a really good option to get if a decision needed to be made on \"what do I get?\".  The service was great and polite. There was a little of a wait but the service crew had everything in order and in control. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but 3 out of our 4 orders were not correct. Service was terrible. Too bad - the Squeeze in Reno is awesome."}
{"text":"Looking for a unique family friendly breakfast place to enjoy, well look no more. Squeeze In is definitely a place to go to grab a bite to eat. They have inside and outside dining. This place is very bright with lots to look at when your waiting for your food. The walls are plastered with writings and the ceilings have unique Vegas paintings and drawings. Aliens were everywhere!! The staff were friendly and ready to assist. The prices are a little bit pricy but you get a lot for your buck. I wish there was a bigger bathroom space because I never got a chance to use the bathroom. There was only one stall.   My girlfriend and I waited a little bit for our food but I'm sure it was due to the full house. We both tried the Racy Tracy which was featured on the Food Network with Bobby Flay  pretty darn delicious!!! We also had a Mimosa that ended up being free because I checked in.   Overall, I enjoyed this Resturant and will be returning soon. They also have a reward program which i signed up for immediately. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was really expecting to give this restaurant a five star rating but I can not my omelette was really good potato were really good but I ordered a biscuit with my breakfast and it was not cooked properly"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. When you go you have to ask for jhalisa shes the best. Don't  skip the manoukian mind melt its amazing. Love this place!"}
{"text":"There are some problems at squeezed in. This is an omelette place, but their omelettes aren't great. They don't make them the traditional way. (I.e put toppings in a pan, add egg, add cheese at the end) They cook the eggs, then once completely cooked they add the toppings and fold it over. The result is an egg taco. This also means that both omelettes I've had so far (tippy Thomas & beefy blue) were way over brown and dry. They seem to notice this as the obviously overdone side (completely brown) is always on the inside. The end result is that the egg to topping ratio is way off.  My last visit my omelette was advertised as a ground beef and blue cheese omelette. What I got was the aforementioned badly cooked omelette with 2 inches of hamburger patties crumpled up inside. And no seasoning. It wasn't good. The potatoes that come with it are inconsistent. They were great the first time and bad the second. They will give you as much toast as you want so that's nice.  The other items are great. The eggs Benedict and French toast are worth getting, but they don't know how to make an omelette. I want to love this place like my wife does, but I just can't."}
{"text":"Great service.  Huge portions of.food at a reasonable price. I ordered the 1/2lb king crab bendict which was extremely filling but i made sure to eat every bite. No complaints here."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've eaten in Las Vegas, I'm not sure who they're paying to write their good reviews but it's completely inaccurate I got some an egg dish and it was completely disgusting ; no taste and the veggies weren't fresh. I also got some pancakes and although they were too expensive they were also completely dried out, the syrup wasn't even good. The servers were great but the food is terrible!!!!!!!! The coffee didn't even have flavor either. For 2 people are bill was almost $50 Paid yelpers need to stop writing good reviews for this place because it's misleading"}
{"text":"Banana walnut pancakes are outstanding and A Must!!!! All omelets and sandwiches are great! I also love their Biscuits / gravy and Hashbrown.. Hit this place for Breakfast and the service really helps with this busy restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This place is one on theeeee Best Breakfast places in all of Las Vegas!!! Get the backn mushroom avocado omelette with a side of Banana walnut pancakes !! This place focuses on Sweet and Salty taste buds!!!!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Had friends in town so we tried this place for the first time. Super friendly staff awaits you as you enter. We were seated immediately and the service was exceptional. Food was great and portion sizes were very good. I had an omelette and substiuted my toast for a jack johnson pancake which was hands down the best tasting pancake I have ever had. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great.  Even when the place packed.  I just recommend the house  bloody Mary it okay tasting but not great tasting"}
{"text":"It was a Sat early morn after swimming at the gym, my friend & I decided to grab breakfast! We went to 2 places & they were packed, we were gonna pass when way in the corner we saw the this place, so we went & they sat us right way! It's quaint & comfy the food was deeelish! It must have been the time frame cause when we left, it was packed with hustle & bustle! Cute little place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to this place forever... I took my family here for breakfast before leaving on the plane with extreme. BUT after sitting there for 30minutes while everyone around us that came AFTER US was being served, my excitement turned to disappointment. We were not served nor asked if we were ready to order... total ignorance. So disappointed in the customer service. Please treat your ppl better. I ant to add that we were the only black ok in the restaurant that was sitting there NOT being served or asked if we were ready... I took my family to Pegs glorified ham and eggs. And they left Vegas happy and full"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place - we came in for the first time and the restaurant was fairly full. They were quick to get our drink order, we bought a Snuggler and Baileys & coffee - highly recommended for yummy alcoholic brunch drinks.  We also bought a Queen Maggie which is a stuffed French toast, so delicious, and Huevos Montana - the boyfriend really enjoyed it. The plates have quite a bit of food, we could've shared and possibly even had extra.  They do have a few vegan options available as well, if that's something you are looking for. The atmosphere of this place is fun and different. The customer service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Fun breakfast spot. Food is good, coffee is terrible. Service is spotty. Favorite dish hands down are the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I have been here many times since moving to Vegas it's one of the best breakfast places to go to. Mimosa's are always strong and the oj is hand squeezed. I usually get the burrito. Yummy"}
{"text":"What a great place to order lunch from! We use GrubHub every time we want their sandwiches and fries for lunch. Even their takeout orders come to us tasty, so I can only imagine what it tastes like when sitting in for lunch.  One day we'll definitely find out.  I suggest their sandwiches or pancakes. Deeeeelish."}
{"text":"I'm thankful for great brunch places in town, and more so, now that Squeeze In is in my part of town. The food here is fresh, delicious, and in generous portions. I absolutely love the service, too. We never went without refills or being checked on through the entire meal.  I order delivery from their Eastern location and it's fantastic, so finally trying it in person at the restaurant made me happy to know that it's just as tasty but hotter than delivery.  Love the food. You need to eat here. I suggest ordering one plate at first to share for two then trying another one if you feel like eating more."}
{"text":"It was me and boyfriends first time here and I've got to say that our experience was phenomenal. I'm a big fan of brunch and everything just sounded delicious it was hard to choose. Big thanks to our server Andrew that helped us with a great rundown on the menu. His energy was awesome. We got our food and I was satisfied and very full. Overall the service was great the vibe inside was awesome and I would recommend people to check it out! Oh! And if you like bacon definitely try the chocolate covered bacon!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is a bit....juvenile with all the drawings on the walls but it's nice to have something a bit unique. Staff was friendly. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I overlooked Squeeze In in the past but I'm SO glad our party of 8 decided to come here instead of Stacks & Yokes. Stacks & Yokes didn't offer any mimosas while Squeeze In offers a FREE cocktail with the purchase of an entree.   We were seated really quickly and the servers were very patient with us while we waited for someone in the party to come. If you order 2 mimosas or vodka drinks, its cheaper, by only a dollar or two. If you have 2 or more people, I would recommend ordering a pitcher (5 servings) of mimosa for $25. Everyone ordered 2 mimosas while my gf ordered the Mama's special juice (lemonade, vodka & a splash of cranberry) and I got the bloody mary. My friend did not like the Mama's special because she said she couldn't taste the vodka in it (but I did). I would not recommend the bloody mary... it was a bit watered down and I felt like it needed more bloody mary mix.   The menu was a bit overwhelming because we were starving but I went with the Racy Tracy and shared the Queen Maggie.  4/5- Racy Tracy: Mushrooms, cheese, bacon & avocado, served with your choice of toast & potato spuds. The potato spuds were SO GOOD. The entire table enjoyed the spuds. They were very crispy and perfectly seasoned IMO.  3/5- Queen Maggie: French toast with cream cheese filling & strawberries and bananas. Not the best french toast I've had, but not the worst either. The cream cheese was hard. I think it would have been better if it was cooked longer and the cream cheese was softer.   We did not pay attention to the time because of the time change and the clocks were an hour behind. Our server, Teddy, was attentive and didn't give us any mean looks even though we stayed past closing time. In our defense, there was another party that came in 10 minutes before closing!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab some great food! I highly recommend this place. Decorative fun environment, friendly staff, large portions, and really good prices. I had breakfast there with a few buddies yesterday morning before going on a long motorcycle ride. We all had a great time. This review is written on behalf of the entire group."}
{"text":"This place iis great, the food is amazing and the service is friendly. Andrew, in particular, is knowledgeable, professional and amazing. I would recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"This survey is a bit late to come.   I'm a huge foodie, I love when new restaurants open up near me.   I was sadly disappointed, such a bummer because it's right across the street from my house. To start off prices are way too high. I know it's a chain restaurant that comes from California but this is not California clientele. Especially for the quality of food that I received on my visit.    Service turned off a little bit rough. When they finally took our order for drinks after sitting there for about 15 minutes, we had already decided what we wanted to eat. I dined with my fiancé and his brother. They both ordered breakfast items and I ordered a French dip with the garlic fries. After a very long wait and no refills on our beverages. My fiancé and his brothers food arrived but mine didn't. I figured it was coming out a little late, but nope. After sitting there with no food for almost five minutes and having to flag someone down. All they could say is \"we forgot\". Really, how do you not notice someone just sitting there with no food? In the meantime my fiancé gave me some of his omelette and potatoes and they were very bland to my taste, especially for the high price point. When my sandwich finally arrived my garlic fries were missing. So I mentioned something to the waitress and she apologized, and ran to get them. What arrived next were gross French fries with what looked like Lawry's seasoning. For the up charge for garlic fries this is highly unacceptable. My French dip was cold and made of deli roast beef. Not as described the menu.  There were far more disappointments when dining that day I didn't even mention. We never received any discount or any true apologies for the disappointments when dining here. I really wanted to love this place because it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast joint with brunch cocktails too. Big menu with fresh food. It was busy for weekend brunch, had to wait some for a table but that shows it a new local favorite."}
{"text":"As a pancake lover, I was looking forward to breakfast. They looked good on the menu, but I was turned off by the upcharge of $2.49 for real maple syrup. At an average of $10 per order it should be included! ...so since it was almost noon I tried a sandwich. All seemed to have 3 pieces of bread so most portions appear large. That and many other items had upcharges as options also. My wife had an omelette, large as well but mediocre at best. Service was very good and staff attentive. Many choices of restaurants in the area-this may have been a one stop flop."}
{"text":"So happy to stumble into this cute place!   I couldn't decide between the Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes or the Scramble - they let me order 1 Jack Johnson with my scramble!!!   Best.day.ever. They were both perfect, along with super freindly service.  -1 star for the poor A/C, not sure if it was broken (last Saturday) but it was hot!! I felt bad for the employees, they must've been dying.  It's also a very small space and it can get squishy in there; I assume there would be a wait at peak hours but we got right in shortly after Noon (half the restaurant was already closed down).  All in all, totally recommend! Their menu suits all so everyone will be happy :)  ~ Oh! I'm just now getting \"Squeeze In\" duh! Adorable! I love it all over again! ~"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Attentive and friendly staff.  Breakfast prepared very well and they don't skimp on portions are content. I've sampled several breakfast dishes (wide variety) and meals are  well prepared and very tasty and filling.  I've been to other breakfast places in the area and Squeeze In by far offers the best variety yummy breakfast.  I'd recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible, you wait a long long time to get service, and very expensive! The staff are not to kind as well, trust me find another place to eat, can't believe it has almost 5 stars, what the hell is wrong with people lol"}
{"text":"Nice new addition to the neiborhood,  move over IHOP cause Squeezing in about to squeeze over ur the local community.Dam there food is soooo good. I had am omelette n it was perfect love the menu choices and the atmosphere is bright and friendly. Defiantly a new hot spot 4 me... Nice scratch cooking,  love places like this that take the extra steps to insure  that the quality of there food products impress the eyes and flavor profile and exceed guests expectations. Try it they don't disappoint, remember good things are worth the wait , if there a line."}
{"text":"Cute eclectic restaurant with large portions and great service. Definitely want to go back to try more. Too many options to choose from that you must go back."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast and really good waitstaff. Fun writing on the wall. Servings are huge, fun environment"}
{"text":"Squeeze in wherever you can! Went to check out this place on 4/5/17 and it wasn't crazy busy. They only had two waitrons, one yelled at us \"welcome guys\" but he kept taking orders from customers, which is his job, nothing wrong with that.  But there were no clean tables for two people.  They sat us at a 6 person table because the tables for two that were empty, were filthy. There's no busboy obviously and the two people there are going crazy with all the responsibilities.  It took a while for them to take our drink order and asked for half and half milk and Splenda and never got it.  We couldn't understand why they wouldn't have that already at the table like most restaurants.   We got tired of waiting because we saw the waitress doing something else and we got fed up with the service so we just walked out of there.  Too many smiles from the staff but zero sense of urgency. Even when they saw us walking away they didn't stop us or ask us anything, they just didn't acknowledge it, they were probably thankful.  I don't blame the staff there but the owner needs to step it up and hire more people.  By being cheap you will not achieve the level of customer service you're demanding to your employees."}
{"text":"Came for some lunch on a Monday.. they sat us right away, wasn't really full.. this place is def kid friendly, and it was evident with toddler having a grand ol' time behind us.  The tables are really close together - which isn't a total deal breaker - but I could hear conversations I didn't care to hear around me. So I can only assume how noisy it can get when it's full.  The food was great! Top shelf bloody Mary was excellent.. check in and get 50% off alcohol.   Decor is fun.. very American diner and Vegas   I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot! I visit this area a lot to watch movies or eat at the restaurants around here, but I never noticed this place until I searched yelp for brunch places. The menu had a huge selection and our food was delicious! The service was amazing and there was no wait time for us. Shoutout to Faris for great service!"}
{"text":"The bright-colored walls with scrawled writing on the walls was a bit much. Took 10 minutes to seat us even though there were multiple empty tables. Waited for the server for almost 20 minutes before having to wave one down to take our order. The food is very good, but a bit overpriced and their coffee leaves something to be desired, especially at $3 a cup.   If the service and prices were better, maybe I'd return. There are other places for breakfast that give you the same for lower prices."}
{"text":"I was so excited when Squeeze In moved to very. Since this location opened I have been here several times, although yesterday's experience was a bit disappointing. I'm a big fan of Eric's breakfast burrito, which I ordered. When I received the order it wasn't accompanied by the salsa and sour cream the menu states. I had to ask for it, the burrito was also missing the sprouts. Which seem weird to have but they're a great compliment to the burrito. My friends order also did not include the sauce that comes in the omelette. We waited forever to receive our check, to which I had to go to the hostess station to ask for. To our surprise our server marked \"no sprouts\" on my burrito and \"no sauce\" on my friends omelette. Neither of us disclosed this. I enjoy the Squeeze In and they have fanatic food. I'll definitely go back, I just hope the service is a bit better next time."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Huge portions,  delicious food,  friendly staff!! We'll be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"The decor here is interesting with the Alien theme for a breakfast spot. We had the Holy Crab omelette , which smelled incredibly fishy, and I know it's seafood but crab is very delicate and when I make dishes with it the smell is never that strong. I felt a little sick afterward. The omlette looked and tasted like liquid eggs and not fresh from a shell. Wifey had the Garth sandwich, it was cheesy and definitely a better choice then the omelette. On a positive side the bloody marries tasted great, nice and spicy plus they was free when you check in."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We've ordered the Ronnie breakfast burrito, patty melt, & eggs Benedict and all were great! Didn't expect the eggs Benedict to be cooked so perfectly with delivery."}
{"text":"Decided to take the risk and drive 15 miles to try this place. We are breakfast people and thought it would be nice to have another little spot to add to our favs. It made the cut. Small establishment. Hence the name. Ha. Thought it was about juices. Lol. The servers were very nice and attentive. They had alcoholic beverages too! The mimosa...ahhhh...a full Glass of champagne with a splash of oj. Not the other way round! Just up my ally! Anyway, food. Very nice.  My son's pancake was a little under cooked, but edible. And he ate it! Portions are quite huge too.  Will return. Too bad it's a little out of my way."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is good, service is warm and friendly - and you can write on the walls with crayons. Get a mimosa with a splash of crab!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant has a fun quirky feel to it.  Our experience was good and not so good. The house bloody mary was excellent and the bonus is tabasco sauce and pepper on the table to add more heat if you'd like which I used. My husband enjoyed his \"Quintana Roo\" breakfast; eggs, ham and 2 HUGE pancakes. He said everything was very good including the coffee. My \"Gare Babe's Denver\" omelet was not so good. I wanted to love it because I was starving but it wasn't seasoned at all, it was  bland with rubbery tasteless green peppers. There was supposed to be tomatoes in it and I counted 5 little chopped pieces and they were bundled up on the end of the omelet!  but my biggest complaint is the green peppers LOTS AND LOTS OF THEM which would have been okay if they were good but they were terrible. I hope not but I think they were frozen.  Absolutely NO FLAVOR, they actually tasted like plastic (I am a big fan of green peppers  and never tasted anything like this before). I wasn't a fan of the breakfast potatoes either as they were borderline dried out and again no seasoning and they certainly didn't look like  the same potatoes posted on Yelp!  Anyway, I will return one more time to try something other than an omelet (and no green peppers!)"}
{"text":"delicious as I waddle out the door from a huge breakfast.  Crab benny was good sized and extremely tasty. Highly recommend the potatoes Otis cause we all need more cheese and onions for breakfast.   Service was excellent and Our waitress was fast and pleasant.   Definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere, and great service. My only suggestion, season the breakfast potatoes. They are very plain."}
{"text":"A little early to see the ribbon cutting ceremony but still able to bring a friend along to try the \"Squeeze\" experience. I crossed another creation of my \"to try\" list when I ordered the Big Bad Johnson (sausage, black olives, bell peppers, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese w/tomato pesto (of course); the Squeeze In \"pizza omelet\". Certainly BIG but definitely not bad in any way!"}
{"text":"I'm Giving This Place A 5 Star Based On Everyone Is Friendly And Their Service Is On Point. Also Their Food Arrives With Hearty Portions, Also To Mention This Is A Small Business So We Truly Support What They Are Doing In Our Neighborhood."}
{"text":"I grew up going to squeeze In (Truckee CA) their opening in Henderdon was nostalgic.  Our first visit to the Henderson location was so good!! Our son wanted a t shirt (he fell in love as I had in my youth.) They didn't have his size. Allie (owner?) Told us she had a shirt his size. She would bring it in. Flash forward 2 months or longer (shirt forgotten about) we go for breakfast today.  Allie asks \"is this Holden?\"  She recognizes our son and has a shirt waiting for him!!  Blown away!!! No one cares this much about their customers anymore. Go visit squeeze In. Eastern and pebble. Great food! Seriously awesome team!!! There are so many places to eat these days.  Go to the place that actually cares you are there and remembers YOU when come in!!! Side note  Allie is AMAZING!??!!!"}
{"text":"My search for favorite breakfast Vegas spot continues...   The decor just isn't for me. Writing all over the walls is just tacky as every inch is covered. The menu is not very pleasant to the eye either. Everything has a \"pro tip\" upsell next to it, like add cheese or sauce to this and that for just $1.00. Once or twice is fine, but it's on every other food item. If the food was good you wouldn't have to smother it in sauces...  The restaurant was pretty empty at 8:30 and the service was kinda slow. The waitress didn't have any support staff and she was clearing and wiping down all of her tables alone. Normally breakfast places have a  \"turn n burn\" pace but I didn't get that vibe here which made it feel really sleepy. I wasn't in a rush but the plan was to be out in 60 minutes which couldn't have happened even if we wanted to.   I made my own omelette and tried to be healthy with only veggies and no cheese. I never add salt to my meals when dining out, but the omelette was pretty bland. The spuds were cold which is my biggest annoyance at breakfast restaurants. Yes I know they're pre-made but that's no reason to serve them without heating them up first.   Wasn't sure whether to do 2 or 3 stars, then I remember my coffee mug had lipstick caked on it, yuck."}
{"text":"This is a cool place for breakfast or lunch. Good original menu, excellent friendly service, bright clean restaurant. The omelets are great and the fresh OJ is excellent. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Love the new addition to our center!! Santa's Wrap is thrilled with our new neighbors! Great food and service. Has a wonderful atmosphere, fun!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Wow such a cool vibe. Great ice tea. Unique and delicious omelettes.   Unlimited potatoes and toast. Friendly service and birthday deals. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"About the fourth time coming here and we are never disappointed. Great selection of breakfast and lunch choices. Food servings are quite big and filling. Maybe a little too big but you will not leave there hungry. :) Andrew has been our server every time and makes sure we are taken care of. Makes us feel valued every time we had visited. Very much appreciated for his kindness as well. Never had Krys as our server but had assisted Andrew a few times and is awesome as well. All staff is pretty aware of all guests and makes sure our water and coffees are filled. All show concern and makes sure everything is good. We are greeted every time we come in. We usually go in on Sundays around 10:30 and can get seated right away but today has been the first time we had to wait for a table but for no long than 10 minutes. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The alien Ambience of this spot is super adorable they have a huge menu to choose from for breakfast and brunch and lunch you can split any of their fabulous omelettes and each get your own potatoes and toast I will definitely be going back to try more items on the menu side note they have the cutest coffee cups that you can purchase"}
{"text":"Overpriced! Like not just a little overpriced, but I've never been to a breakfast spot and seen outrageous prices like this. Well we were already here and ordered orange juice so we didn't want to be rude and leave.   It takes a lot for me to give any place 1 star, but the customer service was horrible. After we got our drinks, it took 17 minutes (yes I kept track), before anyone came by to take our order. And it wasn't even busy. $22 for a crab omelet and $13 for French toast. Denny's even has way better French toast. Theirs was so dry and tasteless.   I tip well and base it on service only, not the food quality since it's not them cooking and I would of given them nothing. But my boyfriend feels bad so he left a few bucks.   There are countless reviews of overpriced food, you guys should really take that into consideration."}
{"text":"Quite a diverse menu! Their selection is unique and flavorful.  My wife and I went there this weekend because we had a Groupon and my wife wanted blueberry pancakes! We were not disappointed. The portions were huge. The breakfast was served quickly and it was hot. The coffee was outstanding. I had the traditional eggs Benedict and it was delicious.  My wife's pancakes were about 8\" in diameter, fluffy, and filled with berries.  We would definitely recommend Squeeze In. The service was excellent and the staff was upbeat and accommodating! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant, cute, friendly service and yummy food. Pancakes are amazing, definitely will come back. Portions are great size for the price. Check out a good local spot."}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE breakfast???  Honestly, I could eat breakfast for lunch and dinner!  Squeeze In hits a home run for breakfast!  The service at this location is friendly and fast and so far everything we've had met or surpassed our expectations."}
{"text":"Favorite Things:  -Chicken Noodle Soup -Garlic Fries (bring breath mints) -Home potatoes (they have little bits of cilantro and a little garlic  /onion seasoning that makes them more interesting) -Eggs are always cooked just how we ordered -Breakfast Club mailers for discounts and free beverages - join the club! -Friendly smiling faces of our servers- I forget his name but he always remembers us and is AWESOME! Shout out to you-   Wasn't a fan of the Biscuits n Gravy; the Gravy was a little waxy looking and biscuits, a little dry. Still decent, your basic B'nG dish, but nothing special. Want something special? Find out when their Chicken Noodle day is, that soup was DEEEEEEEELICIOUS. My one big change is if they could offer half size dishes as an option; prices are reasonable for the portions, but it's just a laaarge plate and I'd love to be able to do halfsies. I think I'd branch out and try different stuff that way, too."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the menu is way too big. When you are hungry, everything looks good and you can't make up your mind. My coworker and I shared the full stack of banana pancakes and there was still a lot leftovers. The stuffed french toast is awesome and the potatoes were perfect. Decor is weird but I don't go there for the looks. Huge, and I mean HUGE portions. Check for a Groupon before you go because the prices are about 1-2 dollars above average for a breakfast and lunch place. But the portion size is definitely the factor in that."}
{"text":"I originally went here in Reno, Nevada by UNR, and they opened two in my hometown of Vegas and I couldn't be happier. Probably my #1 breakfast place for French toast and extreme omelettes, because this place is so killer. Service, perfect. Food, perfect. Atmosphere, fun. I love it, and I'll be back all the time."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant a one star if it were not for our server Andrew. He was. 5 star server. He was very friendly and attentive. The food however left much to be desired. 2 people ordered the soup a creamy chicken that had dry pockets of some sort of flour type of material. One person in our party only ate about 4 bites. The croutons on the salad were a burnt oil flavor. The chicken Cesar salad was ok. My egg dish was average at best. We will not return."}
{"text":"Definite a BRUNCH place to go, big portions & lots of great choices...A gem around southwest summerlin area...Andrew was amazing server, kuddos to him!!!"}
{"text":"Andrew is the one to ask for . Came in and he help my family out and gave us great service . Food is delicious and service is A+. Great job guys keep up the good ."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new possible breakfast spot.  Andrew and the rest of the staff were very attentive and courteous. Overall felt welcomed.  Got the Eric breakfast burrito with turkey and side of spuds. Opted to get red sauce though I wish it were a bit spicier, maybe my taste buds are just burnt out. Just add Cholula you'll be good.  GF got the stuffed french toast (huge portion) with nanas and strawbz and a side of sausage.  Both orders were very tasty.  Atmosphere was... outta this world! could've been the alien decor.  Overall satisfied and exceeded my expectations. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Where to begin.... I'm a bit disappointed in this place, considering the amount of great reviews this place managed to get. The service was mediocre to absent and the food was just merrrrr. I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict and my friends ordered a monoukian mind melt with sprouts and avocado ($1.49 extra) and cream of broccoli soup, twice baked scramble with no sour cream, and a Route 66. I'm not sure what was wrong with the kitchen, but no ones order was right except mine.  My eggs Benedict was nothing special and pretty standard amongst all other places. My friends cream of broccoli soup was cold, which was inedible and cold enough that it looked as if had curdled. They offered to reheat the soup, but we kindly declined and instead asked for fries instead. The mind melt came with no avocado and sprouts, so we tried to hunt down a server. Looking for a server was like being a 5 year old child lost in the mall looking for your mom or dad. It took a while for the avocado and sprouts to come. I'm sure that they had to wait for the avocado to ripe, so that was probably the reason why it took so long.  My friend's twice baked scramble had sour cream on it, but at this point, we gave up. The Route 66, is now a literal statement on why it is called 66. It should be called route 666 because it tasted like hell. After almost finishing our meals, we still haven't received our fries yet. We had to remind another server to let them know we didn't receive our fries and ended up taking it to go. I know our server felt bad and he ended up apologizing. I don't think it's the server's fault, but the kitchen staff is really to blame for this disaster. I'm not sure what the excuse is because on our receipt, everything was on there as how we ordered our food. Until the kitchen knows how to read orders and make the food properly, I will probably not go back again. With the price point they offer, I feel as if it is way overpriced for food that you don't even fully receive. There are better breakfast places with competitive pricing and better quality food. I gave this place 3 stars only because the server was so apologetic."}
{"text":"Place is very chill and clean. Love the vibes I get from everyone and the art work/signatures on the wall make it memorable. It's pretty cool to see tons of celebs that have been there. Will be going back again shortly. Loved the himosas. Never had one until I came to this place!   Be sure to try the French toast."}
{"text":"Fantastic omelette Racy Tracey is a must try here. Unlimited potato's and toast also so come hungry"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing experience.   My husband and I were excited to find this place because you don't see a lot of \"mom and pop\" type restaurants here in vegas. The place is charming with a \"local\" feel. We went on a Sunday around 11am, so it was pretty busy, but the host cleared a table off for us quickly and sat me, my husband, and dad by the window. There are many options on the menu from the classics to specialty signature meals.  Our waitress was Allie who was fun, pleasant, down to earth and attentive. She recommended the ruby fizz (grapefruit juice & champagne) and it was delicious. I ordered the \"jack Johnson banana walnut pancakes\" and was not disappointed. Allie was kind enough to recommend the \"short stack\" and informed me the pancakes were large. I appreciated this as I couldn't finish the short stack. The pancakes were absolutely amazing! Better than expected. My dad and husband both loved their meals as well. They serve large portions so we didn't finish our plates, but we left full and happy. The overall mood of the staff feels like a family. The servers are very casual,  friendly, and help each other out, (they all look out for all the tables) so glad we sound this place. We Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is the best hidden find for breakfast.  Going on a Sunday morning after 930am, we expected to wait for a table.  Very surprised to have table immediately with a full capacity of guests seated.  Very friendly staff and service.  Coffee is extremely HOT -- not like many other places.  Really enjoyed the Racy Tracy omelet, which is signature entree.  Reading the menu was interesting with all of the names amd throwbacks of certain celebrity entertainers.  Great experience overall and will definitely return."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place!  My daughter loves to come here for the teddy bear pancake.  Very cute...pancakes are of a giant teddy bear face with fruit as eyes, nose & mouth.  It has left an impression on her and always suggests to come here for breakfast.  We've come here in the past and I've had different things, omelets, scrambles...all very good.  Today we had the Jack Johnson banana walnut pancakes...just wow! SO DELICIOUS!! .  If you like bananas and walnuts...it's a must try.  Their pancakes in general are SO GOOD.  Definitely recommend this place to others and we have been.  Their decor is very cute and funny too.  It's definitely a topic of discussion with our daughter...which is nice because she won't ask for the iPad.   Service is nice as well.  They are busy in the mornings.  I feel that great service is always service with a smile and in the tone...but I understand that it's hard to do at times when you are busy...we are all human.  But if service was also above and beyond...this review would definitely a 5 star.  We were checked on once...but we didn't need much  so everything was fine...but service could have been a tad better to receive that 5 star."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for my friend having food allergens I would never have known about this place and I lived just minutes away! Had a delicious Irish coffee and an even more delicious omelette of which I cannot remember the name..my friend ordered a vegan burrito (though she is not vegan- just allergic to dairy) and was impressed by the taste of it. The staff was attentive and friendly. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I randomly stopped and ate here this morning since we were on that side of town. Cute place! Food was good and pricing wasn't bad either. Pancakes were fluffy and large! Service was friendly and nice. I see they have a location on Ft.Apache so I'll be going to check out that location since it's on my side of town."}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Food was very good. The menu is very busy & kind of all over the place but very cool atmosphere, & different meals. This was my first time to this location & I'll be back! Pricing is decent."}
{"text":"OMG - Awesome Omelettes- We had the Steve's Mighty Omelette and the Lake Taco Omelette - Both were Amazing - A must stop for Breakfast if any where Vegas - Sooooo Good !!!"}
{"text":"We were blown away to see Squeeze In now in Vegas. We have been going to the Truckee and Reno locations for years. The food and service  here are just as amazing as those tried and true locations. So many menu options and we have never had a bad meal or bad time at any location. Andrew and Teddy are fantastic and welcome us like they have known us forever."}
{"text":"All the way from the 775 to the 702 always on point breakfast spot. Been the the reliable go to Great vibes fresh food awesome variety.  Keep it up squeeze in !!"}
{"text":"Wow Andrew was our waiter! He was the best! Anything we ask he was on it! Not only that he was very friendly and funny... great customer service, food was excellent and place was very inviting! Love coming her to relax and have a great meal with my family. No rush nothing just a good meal and a great time!"}
{"text":"Let me start with, i will not be back. The wait is ridiculous (i waited for an hour maybe a little bit longer just to be seat), then once seated i waited another 30-40 mins. Our waitress was far from disengaged as she didn't check on us and our requests weren't met her name was Jen i believe. the food was mediocre for the price paid. I think the long lines were from the hype of them being on foodnetwork and other shows. However, the fact that i waited so long not just to get seated but to get my order in and food was ehhh and the fact the customer service sucked are main reasons i will not be returning. This is your warning"}
{"text":"The best banana walnut pancakes you'll ever have...and the king crab omelette has huge chunks of pulled crab. The decor is whimsical and service outstanding. Highly recommend this sweet delish restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love egg places/restaurants! I was so excited to see that they opened another type of egg restaurant! Squeeze In has a very cool vibe. You are automatically greeted by an alien in the front door and it brings mystery to this place. Their food is amazing and the portions are HUGE! The racy Tracy is basically a stuffed omelette with avocado and potatoes! The potatoes are amazing! I love the way they are seasoned. Their avocado is super fresh and I absolutely love it! If you're more of a sweet person, I recommend the queen Maggie! But be warned it can be a lot! The motto for this restaurant should be come hungry leave happy because the portions are huge and they will make you satisfied! Also don't forgot to join their rewards system!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the portions are enough for 2. Great place to enjoy or even start your day. I checked in for the 50% off alcohol drinks to start my day off right. It's 5 o'clock somewhere right?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review this place. We used to go to one in Reno when we lived there. I am not an omelet person at all. With that in mind this is my favorite breakfast place. I do enjoy their omelets but also other items on the menu as well. The breakfast burrito is awesome. The quality of their food is great. One of the best things here is the service."}
{"text":"Review update: this was my second time eating here and both times that I've gone they have messed up an order. Today they messed up my order and it was hard to get our servers attention bc it was so busy. She took my plate back to the kitchen and had them make me the right omelet however the other person in my party was done eating by the time my new omelet came out. Last time they comped the order they messed up. Not this time. $30 breakfast for 2 and we didn't even get to eat together because they messed up. Not sure that I'll be back now--that left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Sorry to be the first with less than a 5 star review.   Pros: Bloody Mary was good.  Omelette was good.  Potatoes were good.   But, not quite right on the little stuff that matters...  Cons: Glass of ice with 3 oz of Bloody Mary. $7.00.  My $13.00 Omelette doesn't come with toast. $2.00 Extra.  My wife's $15.00 Omelette comes with Toast...one slice.  They say Omelette's are 4 egg. Smallest eggs I've ever seen."}
{"text":"This place is relatively spacious with some...interesting decor. Anyway, me and the hubs got breakfast and didn't have to wait at all for a table. Sweet! Our omelettes were delicious, and HUGE. Two meals in one. The potatoes are awesome (the hubs favorite) and the menu had a ton of delicious options. Some weird/notable things. 1. Aliens. Huh? 2. Splenda in sugar pourers? Hubs coffee was a little too sweet.  3. 2 waitresses handling the entire place, including seating and cashiering. A little slow.  4. Pricing is a little high for a casual breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! Found this place through a Foodie Fest ad and the pictures dragged me in. There's so much on this menu so I mixed a little. I got the Bomb Benny with avocado, bacon and three poached eggs. Instead of hollandaise, I got the tomato pesto sauce which is like a pizza sauce but it was really good with the potatoes. I'm used to only getting two eggs who it was nice and the price wasn't that different than other breakfast places. Will try again."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot! We came across this place on Yelp as a hot and new location in our area. So of course we had to give it a try and I'm glad we did.   The service was fantastic. The waiters were friendly, funny and attentive.  Plus they worked well as a team. I love a restaurant that runs like a well oiled machine.   Then there's the food. The soup of the day was clam chowder and I gave it a try. It was creamy, chock full of clams and potatoes and it had a great flavor. My egg's Benedict was perfect. The egg was perfectly poached so that it drizzled over the English muffin and Canadian bacon when it was cut into. Simply perfection. The English muffin was fluffy. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and flavorful and the side of spuds/home fries were perfectly cooked.   I love this place and it's cool yet simple decor. I look forward to going back and trying one of their other items on their massive menu."}
{"text":"We ordered a Manly Morris, Roo, and Boss burger with garlic fries. For drinks we had coffee, water, and OJ. While the service ok, the food had more potential than was delivered. Garlic fries were under cooked with a heaping spoonful of garlic thrown in the middle. The burger was extremely well done (burnt instead of medium). The pancakes were burnt..."}
{"text":"Ordered Banana nut pancakes and was not disappointed and omelette with bacon and mushrooms. I just can't recall its name. A place around the corner from home."}
{"text":"This place is really unique - fun decor inside and interesting (somewhat dirty) menu item names for meals, plus the servers are all super friendly. They are known for Omelets - they have SO many variations, some made with peanut butter and mushrooms, etc - and we really wanted to try one but neither of us is a big omelet fan. I ended up getting the Spanish Benedict with chorizo and a side of potatoes with cheese and onions; he got biscuits and gravy and eggs. First things first, their portion sizes are insanely big! We ended up sharing a lot of our food, and I'm not complaining about it. The Spanish Benedict was very flavorful and rich, exactly what I was hoping for. The potatoes on the side were so delicious and i felt guilty even eating them. His biscuits and gravy were some of the best I've had here and did I mention, insanely huge portions!? See my pictures for proof. I would totally recommend checking out Squeeze In for their crazy omelets and other menu items!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that this review is reflective only of the one on eastern. We've been to the one on the west side there's obviously a disconnect between that one and this poor imitation.   We went shortly after they first opened and were there for nearly an hour before receiving our order, or at least most of it. The potatoes were missing and after another 10 minutes they finally showed.  Ok they were new and we liked the west side location so we tried again about a month later.  Strike 2: copy and paste the last paragraph and you get the gist.  Strike 3: went this past Saturday, cause really I'm an optimist. It was early and not at all busy. Went inside and let em know we'd like to sit on the patio.  Blank stare- Were gonna sit on the patio. Blank stare- Can I get a menu? Oh, ok. 20 min later:here they come with menus, as we're getting up to leave. And leave we did."}
{"text":"Squeeze In is a very hip place. The atmosphere is unique and comfortable. I was seated immediately with a group of four and all of our dishes were served promptly.   The vegan options are delicious, but limited. On the other hand, if you're not vegan, there's a ton of options. The prices are a little high (tofu and veggies for about $12). The portions definitely are decent. I will be returning, it's a great spot for family and friends to get some breakfast."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of Andrew being our server and he was simply amazing , fast friendly but also aware of everything and that's what I call great customer service ! Mom and I have breakfast every week and we like trying new places in the valley so we found Squeeze In and love it , homemade salsa and the potatoes are out of this world !! Thank you Andrew"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me, and I like that it's in a very convenient location.   My favorite dish here has been the Eric burrito, however I do wish it was bigger since it's on the smaller side. I also like the Suzie's Chicken Sandwich for lunch. If you are looking for a healthier option, the DJ's So Cal Low Cal and the Shi's Super Food Scramble are pretty good and filling.   The worst dish I had here was the Queen Maggie French Toast. Inside the flat pieces of bread were several chunks of plain cream cheese. I had to take them all out since I don't know anyone who would want to eat a whole package of plain cream cheese between two pieces of grilled bread. If it was a cheesecake mixture, it would have been much more palpable.   The ambience here is usually louder and more energetic, and it's a place for bigger families and a younger crowd. All in all, this place is a good local spot, but it doesn't have any special dishes that I would crave or go out of my way to come back for."}
{"text":"Is it worth the hype? Not really!!! 20 min wait, 20 min for our food. Pancakes were burned, eggs cold and food was just ok. I realize that we went during there busy time, but come on management!!! Hire more people, or at least more cooks!!!! Because if you are going to make people wait that long to eat, your food better be dam good, which it wasn't. Costumer service was ok, looked like employees were overwhelmed. Note to self, don't have a TV show spot light your restaurant if you can't handle the pressure. Will I go back, probably not. So, originally I put 1 star and was thinking that's a little harsh, because there food wasn't that terrible, just cold. So they get an average 3 stars."}
{"text":"Water isn't filter.  I think all restaurants should have filter water.  If not, they should sell the bottle water.  Food was average. Big portion.  Enough for 2.  Service is good."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but something is missing to give it 4 or5 stars. The staff was friendly and proficient and did a good job, it just felt liked everyone was on auto-pilot.  I tried a signature dish and it as just so-so. It was kinda blan. There were potato in the omelette not were quite done enough and a bit on the hard side the sausage used was standard grocery store, i excepting different.  .  When all done it felt like I could have made the dish and for something that gets good reviews I was expecting something a little more unique.  I want to be careful and not say all bad, the food was ok and the service was pretty good.  We will try again and see how it goes."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! From start to finish our lovely server Tina was amazing. She had such a sweet personality and was very attentive. I came here twice and couldn't resist but to get the crab omelette both times! It melts in your mouth. The crab taste so flavorful, savory, and buttery. They're not stingy on the potatoes or the avocado. They give plenty! I really enjoyed my whole experience and will always come here with my husband for our brunch dates when we can!"}
{"text":"Squeeze in is the coolest place! Such an awesome atmosphere and you can feel the love when you walk in the door! The best part is that the food, drinks, and service match the vibe! Huge portions & delicious cocktails! Our server, Andrew, provided friendly and genuine service you can't just find anywhere! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Best I've had in Vegas!  They forgot my sauces for my to-go order, but it was so good that it didn't matter."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of the French Consulate in Las Vegas, we visited the Las Vegas Squeeze In this morning for breakfast. We arrived just before a rush and did not have to wait long for a two-top.  The hostess was gracious in letting us order coffee to sip on while we waited. Even if there was a wait, it would be worth it. Based upon my breakfast travels in Seattle a couple of months ago, you know I don't mind a wait for an excellent meal.  The first time you open the menu, or when I was caught late last night in my home office, looking at my computer, with a smile and my eyes glazed over while looking at their online menu, you suddenly realize deciding what you are going to order could be an issue.  We ordered the Racy Tracy California style omelette and the Bombshelter Bacon Benny. The \"Benny\" (Eggs Benedict) had three perfectly poached eggs, yes I said three which is perfect because two eggs are just not enough.  We checked in on Yelp and got a coupon for a free \"Drink\" so we had the Bloody Mary.  We were fortunate to have Allie, the General Manager serve us today. She and her staff were dressed up for Halloween and she is just a joy to be around.  Next time around I am going for the king crab omelette and will finish the meal with the chocolate bacon. Yes I said chocolate bacon.  Time for my Sunday nap..."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot. Fresh coffee and food! Our favorite is the breakfast burrito. It is so loaded that two people could share it. Everyone is friendly. Awesome rewards program too!"}
{"text":"If you love large portions this is your place.  The menu is huge and the food is very tasty.  I will definitely visit this restaurant again.  The waitstaff was nice too."}
{"text":"Awesome omelette selection with so many different choices AND you can get them as a burrito or scramble! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"One of our favorite brunch places. Great food selection. King crab omelette...worth it. Lots of crab!  Kids portions are big. Place gets busy so be prepared to wait 20-40 min."}
{"text":"I love this place! We live close by and my boyfriend and I will be coming in more often! This is the kind of place I'd like to go when we have guests staying with us in Vegas. Prices are great for the amount (and quality) of food you're going to get. Great atmosphere, kind staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome, the food was okay. Not great by any means. I'm a breakfast fein and have found many amazing breakfast joints around the country. I was really excited to go here and it just didn't live up to its reviews. Everything I had was bland, and the spuds tasted like they had been re-heated, the coffee wasn't very good either and they didn't offer iced coffee which I thought was kinda odd for a modern breakfast joint in Las Vegas but idk maybe I'm just spoiled. my boyfriends breakfast came first because apparently the kitchen messed my meal up and had to re-make it. If my Heuvos Montana would've been amazing I woulda forgot all about the delay. They did however comp my meal for the mistake which was nice & again the customer service was very friendly and on top of it. If only they could take a little more time in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. Dog friendly and great food. The Big Fat Greek Omelet is sooooo good.  Bonus round, they have beer too!!! Nothing like an IPA with your omelet. King crab Bene is also really good. This is a must have place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm going to trust Yelp for food  reviews anymore. This is the second place we've been to this week for \"AMAZING BREAKFAST\" that was just mediocre.   First off, our wait for a table was 10 mins but it took over an hour to get our food. We both got French toast. The wife had Kay's Frenchie and it was pretty good, not amazing though. She had a side of spuds and they were sad. Just tasted like potatoes...no flavor, no seasoning. That kinda blew my mind.   I had the Queen Maggie and was pretty disappointed. From the looks of the pictures and the Food Network favorite endorsement I was super excited. It was some French toast, with a slice of cream cheese in the middle. Yes, a slice. Not stuffed and fluffy and creamy. And then some strawberries and bananas on top. I've had better stuffed French toast at ihop. I don't know how this is a Food network chef's favorite.   The only saving grace was our server Chelsea. She was awesome! She was running around like crazy from the second we walked in the door. I forgive the hour long wait cause she was working so dang hard! She comped our mimosas and thanked us for waiting so long over and over. We loved her!  The decor is fun and I really wanted to love this place...but the sub par food will probably prevent me from coming back. I find it hard to believe these are the recipes being served at their original flagship location."}
{"text":"This place is legit! I would've taken a picture of my \"Top Shelf\" Bloody Mary but I was too busy drinking it!! Lol! Sooo good! And they had a coupon in the zip code magazine for buy 1 entree and get a kid's meal free so my younger kids were able to eat for free!! Not only that but they had baskets with small toys for them to play with at the table! Genius!! I wish every restaurant did that! (My kids couldn't care less about coloring.)   Our server Amy was the best! She didn't even bat a lash when my 1 year old decided that he wanted to start playing catch with his toys/silverware and the floor... the floor didn't want to play.   We got our food promptly after ordering and the portions were big! My teenage daughter ordered the French toast and bacon and said it was delish! I ordered an extra side of bacon for myself and the toddler and we can attest to that!  My 4y ordered the grilled cheese (they make it just the way you like it with choices of bread and cheese) and a fruit bowl with melons and berries.  And I got the Cobb Salad. It was wonderful! It took my some time before I even found the lettuce underneath all the toppings!   This place was a win for me and my family and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It was good, there seems to be some pretty weird food there. Don't worry there's lots of normal things too, as well. I just can't seem to get behind an omelet that has sautéed apples and bananas in butter and honey and peanut butter sounds really crazy. I had something called a Donnie something or other. It was a pancake filled with fruit sautéed in butter and you have the option to include cream cheese and sausage inside it, I asked if I could just have the cream cheese in it and have the sausage on the side and I'm glad I did that. Sausage was pretty spicy they also have real maple syrup which is hard to find in these parts. I also wanted to try the chocolate covered bacon. I personally was not a fan it was very chocolatey and it was cold. Everything else I had was to my liking I would definitely suggest getting cheese on the potatoes because I think without it they would be pretty boring. I keep hoping that one of these days I'm going to like mimosas I had something called a hi-mosa which had orange juice cranberry and champagne together. In terms of Breakfast cocktails even though I just do not like champagne this was actually probably the best one I've had. My man friend had a Cobb salad which was pretty big and he had a bloody Mary very spicy and he drink every last drop of it. The couple we went with have been there several times and they always say the food is very good and they like their food as well. I have a party of four we went in at 11 we had a fairly long wait I feel but it's a really small place. Originally they were going to try to squeeze us at a really small table we opted to wait for a larger table in all fairness.  I wish I got the biscuits and gravy because they looked so good . I'll probably go back and give this place another try it didn't wow me but it wasn't terrible either and the service was really friendly."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Was checking out Yelp one day for anything Hot and new and Squeeze In came up.  I checked out the menu and immediately signed up for their rewards club.  We waited a bit to go but when we did WOW!!!  The food is awesome :)  Best coffee around as well.  Service from all the staff is always great, we usually go once a week.  Have been for both breakfast and lunch and loved everything.  Great omelets but also the breakfast potatoes!!  They are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside just the way they should be.  I have already been enough to get a rewards certificate!  Two favorites are the Manoukian Mind Melt sandwich and the Nebraska Rae omelet!!  And if you like garlic do the upgrade to the garlic fries...they are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay for me. Menu pictures made food look better than it tasted. Some meals were better than others.   I had an expensive $14 omelet of average to smaller size. They forgot the avocado that was part of the menu description. This is weird for me to say this, because I love bacon. But, they put waaay too much bacon inside the omelet pocket. Maybe, if the bacon was cooked better I'd have been okay with it. The potatoes were decent and came with a side of nacho cheese. The pancakes were good. All in all, I was a little disappointed and would have rather gotten IHOP."}
{"text":"The banana pancakes are to die for, add chocolate bacon to go with it. Also, there is a wide variety of mimosas hmmmmm.  The waiting is not too long, service is fast but not rushy."}
{"text":"We happened upon Squeeze In while picking up a cake at the vegan bakery next door. Food was good, huge portions! I had the twice baked scramble and my boyfriend had the Your Momma Omelette, we were not disappointed. Waitress was very nice and attentive, good place to try out!"}
{"text":"My first experience could have easily been a 5 star one, as my breakfast itself was FANTASTIC! The crab omelette was great, and the spuds were amazing! The cheese dip goes wonderfully with the potatoes. I even redeemed my Yelp Check in and got the Blue Tahoe Top Shelf Bloody Mary for $5. It was awesome! Not too spicy, a little extra A1 like I asked, and they didn't skimp on the vodka.   However, aside from the actual breakfast meal itself, the experience was not good. We arrived before 11am (10:50ish) and were told it was a 15-20 minute wait. Not a problem by any means on a bright Sunday morning.  After waiting 30 minutes I asked what order we were in the line up, and we were next. No more than 5 minutes after I was told this, another group of three was seated before us, even though they had only arrived 10 minutes prior. And my 10 minutes prior to me getting there, but they only waited a total of 10 minutes or less. This is not okay; I don't care who you know at the restaurant, but we were waiting. Strike one.   About ten minutes after that transpired, I finally went up and asked if we could be seated as there were four open tables which had been vacant and cleaned for a good fifteen minutes. They said sure, pointed out the table, and that was it. Didn't give us menus, didn't walk us to the table....rather rude if you ask me. Strike two. (To lay out the timeline, we arrived at 10:50. Were seated at 11:45. So much for a 15-20 minute wait..........)  Finally, after being seated for a while, they took our drink order. They were out of lemonade, so no Arnold Palmer for my father in law. Which he drinks EVERYWHERE. Okay, I get it. You're out of lemonade. It happens. So he orders an iced tea and asks for sweetenlow. They don't have sweetenlow. Seriously? Either someone messed up on ordering, or their food service distributor sucks. And on top of that, we had to ask twice to have our order taken after already waiting for nearly an hour. Strike three!  However, after it taking over an hour to get seated and order our food, our food came rather expeditiously and was great. This leads me to believe the problem was definitely not in the kitchen.   I overheard two short skirmishes between waitresses that were frustrated or angry, and another table had such a bad experience I'm pretty sure I overheard the head waitress comp their whole meal. (Wouldn't have minded mine getting comped........)  Just a TERRIBLE customer service experience, and something should be done to rectify the situation so this doesn't happen again. Restaurant has amazing potential. The dining area itself is friendly, clean, and quirky, and the food is wonderful. The service staff needs to definitely step up the hell out of their game. I honestly felt like they were heavily understaffed, but there were 4 waitresses I identified, and 5 other staff members. Someone needed to step up to the plate.......   Would I come back here myself? Only if someone is going to guarantee me good service, otherwise there are plenty of other great breakfast joints in town.   Would I recommend this place to other? Most definitely, but I'd give them fair warning that to get great food, you have to put up with crappy service."}
{"text":"Gargantuan portions don't always mean awesome food. I ordered an omelette off on the special board outside. Got super full off of it, but it was pretty reminiscent of IHOP quality (canned mushrooms & quick eggs maybe? idk)...At any rate, their menu is full of creative ingredient mashups to spice up your normal breakfast fare.  I did \"squeeze in\" very close to closing time and the service I got reflected it. Had to ask for several things twice...Nobody really wants their sourdough toast to show up when their omelette is pretty much gone. Pretty sure my server left for the day halfway through my meal.  Might give these guys another try, but not in a huge rush. Their breakfast club seems to have some pretty sweet rewards though (free bottles of champagne, etc.)."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! I enjoyed my brunch simply because of him.  All of his recommendations were on point.  Would have to come back with a appetite the portions are huge if you are a light eater like I am.  Great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool place for brunch... large menu! \"Every bubbly needs a buddy\" mimosa bundle yummm."}
{"text":"Found this spot on accident and I am glad I did, they have great food with a fun theme in the whole place. Great for everyone of all ages, my daughter and husband loved that we got to leave our mark on a wall. The waitress gave us a sharpie and said find a open space and leave your mark, \"The Reese Family 2017\" is now in the restaurant on the wall. Pretty cool and the food was good, quick and the service was great friendly and helpful. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Very novel name for a breakfast location with great customer service.  The Eric breakfast burrito cannot be \"under 500 calories\" because it was so darn good.  I would like to do the crab melt next time."}
{"text":"Great food, vegan options!! Exceptional service... both boys went above and beyond! We have two year old twins.. as you can imagine we're not ideal customers, but they were so sweet and helpful! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Adorable restaurant with mediocre food. I had the chorizo omelet whuch came with jalapenos. I was disappointed to find out they were pickled jalapenos. For a $14 burrito I would have expected fresh jalapenos. My sister had the Eric's burrito. She requested extra crispy bacon and got soggy bacon. The food was fine but nothing spectacular.  I had an Orange juice and  she had water ..after tip.  Our mediocre breakfast was $40."}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get when you meet your dad for the first time? I'm seriously asking, because I've never met mine, but I imagine it probably feels as great as any visit to Squeeze In.   The whole staff is very personable, attentive, and on top of their client's water/coffee. They're definitely functioning on a whole different level of brain activity than most since they always remember my friends and I, and it probably has to do with that alien out front.   On top of all of that, the food is phenomenal, get the Veggie Benny. Tell them Robert sent ya, they'll have no idea what you're talking about. Best breakfast spot in the Silverado/Green Valley area for sure, maybe even the whole Las Vegas valley."}
{"text":"Very modern and hipsterish enterior. Extremly friendly stuff. Food is very good. I had a vegeterian burito wich comes with a side of chips and salsa which was very tasty. 5 stars for having vegetarian options. My friends had traditional breakfast with eggs and ham and portions are huge they couldn't finish. Deffinitelly place to come back"}
{"text":"With husband and toddler in tow, we decided to try this new restaurant in our neighborhood and were pleasantly surprised!  They immediately gave our little one a basket of toys to keep him occupied while we reviewed the menu. The decor was eclectic with different chairs and tables, nostalgic license plates, and pictures hanging on the walls. It was the Fourth of July and the restaurant was taking donations for Wounded Warriors in lieu of the check tab. The menu was colorful and listed items from omelettes to breakfast to lunch items - in that order. All of the food had special names and there was so much variety. We ended up ordering a turkey omelette, banana walnut pancakes, and chocolate bacon (yes, chocolate bacon). All omelettes are made with 4 eggs, which makes a very hefty platter with almost a guarantee for leftovers. The pancakes were huge and delicious. The chocolate bacon, however, was a bit chewy instead of crunchy (how we like it). At the end of the day, our tummies were happy!  This is a definite place to return to."}
{"text":"We've been going to the South Reno location for years and love it! We were thrilled to hear they were opening in Las Vegas. We've already been there 4 times!  They have an awesome menu, but their omelets are the best as well as the pancakes. Yum!!  The staff and vibe at this location is what makes it. So glad you're here! Looking forward to the Eastern location."}
{"text":"Holy Crab Omelet.....Ridiculous!!! Great Job Guys! Andrew our waiter was Amazing! Looking forward to making this our new \"local spot\""}
{"text":"Food is solid. Service is great. Ask for Andrew, he's the man. They also have drinks, so you don't have to wait until Sunday brunch to have a mimosa with breakfast. It's very pricy though, fair warning. But totally worth it in the end, the food is that good. Sign up for the rewards program too."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot with a fun and unique feel.  Food was solid.  Serve was okay but they seemed a little overwhelmed at peak breakfast time.  They recovered and took good care of us.  Large portions too!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Tons on menu. Service was mediocre.  There was an eyelash on my lemon slice. Nothing was done about it. No discount. No apology. Nothing organic on menu."}
{"text":"Interesting theme for a breakfast / lunch restaurant and graffiti decor inside on the walls.  I came in here to a very 70's type theme with a hint of alien too.  Food was mediocre at best, clothing hanger in the middle of the aisle with the restaurant souvenir t-shirts for sale (not sure who would buy this) and confusing entrance right beside a vegan bites place.  I had ordered Quintana breakfast which consisted of bacon, eggs over easy and pancakes.  My egg whites were runny, pancake was somewhat distasteful and my bacon was burnt.  I was hungry, so it was decent, but not sure if I would be back.  Between that and the clutter of souvenirs when you walk in just seemed unorganized, but the staff were very polite."}
{"text":"Well I first I have to start off by saying that Squeeze In has the funniest and the absolute best menu that I have ever seen!!!! The names for their dishes are absolutely hilarious and make the experience that much better. From names like Racy Tracy, My Big Fat Greek Omelette, and Dirty Dick make Squeeze In's menu over the top amazing! I got to enjoy the Holy Crab omelette and Erick's burrito. I absolutely loved the Holy Crab. It was filled with crab tossed with butter, green onions inside of the omelette, topped off with avocado, potatoes with your choice of three sauces and toast. They have so many cool deals and so many amazing plates to chose from. Check in on Yelp and get and awesome drink deal or upgrade! Service is great and they also have a cool rewards program."}
{"text":"I had the Greek omelet with added chicken. It was good but average. I would recommend this place or come back again for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I owed them this review the first time we went a few months ago. This is a fun, urban-feeling breakfast spot that reminds my husband and I of indie places we loved in Chicago. They are few and far between here in Vegas. The food is huge and great, always good for a second meal to go.   What prompts me to finally write the review is the experience we had today. We took our kids for the first time. It was quiet, since it was early on a Monday, so we didn't feel bad about subjecting our loud pre-schoolers to too many people. Unexpectedly our 4 yo daughter had a seizure, which we are used to handling. The couple next to us was surprised by it but very kind, and the servers were helpful, offering a cool towel and to-go containers for our food. A wonderfully kind patron even quietly handled our bill amidst the chaos.   While I don't specifically recommend having a medical event in the restaurant, I am thankful it was probably the second best place to being home this morning. Thanks so much to Squeeze Inn for being a great place to eat and for being so helpful today. Support them and get some delicious brunch!"}
{"text":"Im back at squeeze in because my best friend Jennifer absolutely loves this place. I must say they totally made up for the last time. The food is amazing and the service is wonderful this time. We have the same server and shes perfect. Im so happy I gave it another chance!"}
{"text":"My main issue is not with the staff or the food.  The issue lies with the management/owner of this place.  We went for brunch today (4th of July).  There was a total of three people running the front of the house, three!  Three people for 20-30 tables.  These poor girls were taking orders, bussing tables, and cashing people out.  The waits were so long people started to get up and get things they needed them selves.  It was insanity.  The poor staff was so overwhelmed they forget pretty much anything that was asked of them.  The food was cold by the time it was brought to the table as such it was mediocre at best.  I will not be dining here ever again.  The main accolade they advertise is being on the Bobby Flay show \" Throw Down with Bobby Flay in 2010.  This is the equivalent of restaurants that advertise \"Review Journal best of 2012.  It is an \"award\" 7 years old and should not be taken seriously."}
{"text":"DA BOMB DIGGITY! 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND! Staff was super friendly and helpful. Great breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! At the beginning the inside was full so I was the only one on the patio. Frankie was very attentive and never lacked hot coffee. The Flay omelette was excellent but kind of pricey.   This my first time here and the one suggestion would be add a page to the menu, it is very cluttered and hard to read. Also add a location in the north side of the valley!!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. Cold bacon, cold eggs. Asked for sausage no sausage. Disappointed with all the good reviews on here. Expected to really enjoy our breakfast.  Food was just ok. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is outta this world!  Discovered this gem under \"hot and new\" on Yelp and had to check this place out. I was surprised to find that they are planning to open 6 locations in Vegas.   First, service. Staffs here are impeccable. Welcomes you in the place as if you are invited into their home, gives you great suggestion, smiles at you even if you look like a hot mess...what a place to be.   Food. I'm not fan of omelet of any sort but my friendly server suggested their top seller dish, Racy Tracy. Apparently it was featured on Food network so I wanted to give it a try. First bite in and I could not believe how good it was. Where have you been all my life? Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?  After half way of my omelet, my server had offered me three sauce options: creamy mushroom, tomato pesto or cheddar cheese. Are you serious? How do you expect me to choose from such selection. Ended up getting all three and all were divine. My favorite has to be the tomato pesto though.  Also got to try their chicken fried steak (not sure of its name on their menu). Love the home cooking kinda plate like this. Both gravy + chicken were on point.   Great morning with wonderful service and food accompanied by all the aliens. Would love to come back again in near future."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very good. The food tasted weird and the bacon was disgusting looking. DONT GET THE LEMONADE, it tastes like they squeezed half a lemon into some water"}
{"text":"Incredible place that I never would have known about without Yelp.  The omelets here are without equal in Las Vegas.  I know this is a BOLD statement, but I have been to all of the other places, and they pale in comparison.  Come and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the jack johnson pancakes since they looked so good on the pics.. but honestly ihop pancakes are better ... bacon was good though ."}
{"text":"Came here for their soft opening for the free food, and was very pleased with what I got. I tried the King Crab Benedict and really enjoyed it. I was also able to try the Bacon Benedict and really enjoyed the mushrooms on that. Will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Dear Squeeze In Owners/Management,  You are exceptional, and this was my first time dining in with an out-of-town guest. Menu = a smorgasbord with funny names. Food = phenomenal. Atmosphere = lively PLUS you can write on the walls; haven't been in a restaurant with this feature in a lonnnng time.   Here's why I would give it 10 stars. Listen closely.   Jahlisa (superb Manager) and waitress-in-training SteF top off the best features of the restaurant. They were entertaining, lively, precise, and truly cared about everyone's experience. They are 100% customer service, satisfaction guaranteed.   Would I come back for the food and drinks? Sure, but I would mostly come back when Jahlisa and SteF are working. We need more of them in the world. Please relay! They deserve something nice...~Jamie"}
{"text":"Simply amazing, I would recommend everyone stop by and try and crab Bene! Tell em your uncle Craig sent ya!"}
{"text":"Squeeze In - Las Vegas, NV (Eastern Ave)  I admit it, I love me some eggs. I love the taste of eggs and it's cheap. I also love eggs for their nutritional profile. It's a good source of protein, fat, and Vitamin D. I am consuming upward of 10+ eggs on a daily basis. That's on the real. That being said, I know the difference between a good omelet and a great one. Squeeze In has a great one known as the Hangover Helper and it just may be my favorite omelet in town. The Hangover Helper consist of at least 4 large eggs, tons of cheese, thick slices of bacon, diced ham, and a few sausage links. I'll treat this bad boy like a scramble and mix the whole thing before devouring it. The entire omelet is tasty, hearty, huge, and I definitely recommend.   Squeeze In originated from Reno, Nevada. They currently have two locations in Las Vegas. Both locations can get busy during lunch. Both locations also excels at great customer service. I'm sure that I'll be back soon.    TIP:  Their omelets are served with bottomless toast and potatoes. Yup!!"}
{"text":"Squeeze In - Las Vegas, NV (Fort Apache Location)  Breakfast for lunch, That's how I do it. I dined at Squeeze In, So I can review it.  All you can eat spuds, and even the toast. They're known for their omelets, I liked the Hangover the most.   Want bacon and sausage? Oh Yes, please! The Hangover's got it, with a ton of cheese.  I really wanted to hate this place, What did I just say? If you're not happy with your omelet, You don't have to pay.  That's their motto,  I had nothing to lose. They have a lot more to offer, Just read the reviews.  They're omelets are awesome, What else can I say? It's definitely hearty, and took my breathe away.  Krista my server, was as nice as can be. She kept my drinks full, and took great care of me.  So, if it's omelets you crave, Squeeze In's a winner. Just get here early, because they're closed for dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I love that they have vegan options as not a ton of breakfast/lunch places offer that. The staff is really nice too, even when my friends and I unknowingly stayed an hour past closing time. (Sorry guys) Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is incredible. Squeeze in is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Down home feel with large portions. Had the Spanish flat omelette with side of French toast. Great service, friendly staff...will definitely come back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Great vibe, super friendly staff, fun menu and great food!! Best french toast ! Queen Maggie  Food Network reviewed!"}
{"text":"Neat place for brunch, uniquely different. Had the Jack Johnson pancakes, recommend the short stack. Eric breakfast burrito was amazing!  If your getting the French toast I would avoid the cream cheese stuffed version, the cream cheese is just overpowering. Coffee was standard. If you let them know santas wrap sent you you get a free mimosa.  Chocolate covered bacon was interesting if you are feeling adventurous try one"}
{"text":"Our new staple breakfast/brunch place . Service was in top and our server Andrew was exceptional! He was very attentive and took care of our needs. I didn't get the other lady's name but she took our drinks order and she was wonderful as well. I ordered the twice baked scramble and that was good. Special mention to their jack Johnson pancake and let me tell you, that is quite possibly the best pancake I've ever had! It was fluffy and just perfect! Oh and the mimosa, they did not scrimp on the champagne at all. I was proud"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service needs improvement.  Requested no cheese on sandwich. Food came with cheese.  Server forgot to include garlic toast with salads.  Asked for mayo on BLT. It came w/o it.  I'm sure things will get better with time.  I will go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Everything we ordered was delicious. My son had the kids combo with pancake (light and fluffy) and bacon (crispy, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful). I had the Racy Tracy omelette with avocado. My husband had the hangover Benedict, which was the special of the day.  Both dishes were flavorful and delicious.   Our problem was not stopping there! We shared both the Nutella stuffed french toast AND their banana walnut pancakes.. Let me just say this.. Don't order either of these dishes and expect to \"just have a bite.\" Both are so darn tasty, sweet and fat free (not fat free at all but that's what I told myself to justify eating both)!   We are definitely coming back here. They have other locations but the service was great here.  Their menu has so many options. It takes a while to decide what to try. My advice, sample a few dishes and share. You can't go wrong with any of them!   They also have healthier options for those not wanting to live life a little and have a \"cheat meal\""}
{"text":"I placed an order with them through Grub Hub. It was tasty and prompt, I received the order at least 15 mins ahead of the scheduled time. I ordered the Banana Walnut pancakes, warm and delectable they were!!"}
{"text":"Finally I got to try the breakfast from this place! Tried the banana walnut pancakes and egg Benedict!! They were absolutely delicious! The customer service was over the top! As we walked in, got a good morning from everyone. The server, Andrew was super nice and super professional. We seriously do appreciate a great customer service and with him being the server, just be assured that you will be well taken care of!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough great things about this place! GREAT food, wide selection of quirky dishes and classic breakfast dishes. Staff is friendly.. food comes out fast.. great portions.. no I dont work here lol My server Jenna was awesome....I'll surely be back soon... I'll get a beer or mimosa next time. I had the \"Cathy Who\" dish.. its a must try!!!Ohh... I love the music here!"}
{"text":"I heard about Squeeze In from friends in Reno, so when my hubby who was a little worse for wear from a bout with the \"bottle flu\" and needed a big brunch to help soothe his stomach, we decided to try Squeeze In.  After a 15 minute wait, we were seated and a server promptly gave us menus and took our drink orders. She returned with drinks and took our orders.  Ordered food: Hubby, The Redneck; scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, country potatoes, toast. And coffee for his headache  Daughter; the pb+j kids plate with a side of fresh fruit.  Me; plain omelette with loads of avocado and 2 types of salsa, dry wheat toast.  I thought it was a great breakfast, but my husband favors Sunrise Cafe. I thought the extra avocado on my omelette  and delish two salsas are reasons enough to return!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Squeeze In located in Reno and it was always great. I couldn't wait to go to the one here and convinced 6 of my friends to join me. We waited forever for someone to wait on us. We actually had to flag her down. We ordered and requested coffee and tea. The coffee showed up when some of our food did. Several orders were wrong. One of my friends didn't get her meal until the rest were almost done. Coffee, tea and water were not automatically refilled.  Finally I requested to speak with manager. She said she would delete the meal that was late and remove the drinks. When we finally got the bill it was wrong and we had to get the manager back. She made it right and gave us $5 to use on the next trip. There are too many other breakfast places that are attentive and have better breakfast items. What a shame."}
{"text":"New favorite vegas/Henderson restaurant! Cute decor+ super nice staff + crazy big portions + yummy food = perfection! Great coffee, too! Do yourself a favor and check it out (and go back often!)"}
{"text":"Jahlisa is the best! We've been in twice and she takes great care of us. We always get great service along with the pitcher of mimosas and great food! I'm a Vegan and I love all of the options! Squeeze in is definitely our favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for breakfast. It's an eclectic place with writing on the walls. We ordered 3 different egg dishes and all were tasty. The chocolate covered bacon was ok, the chocolate over powered the bacon. Be sure to check Groupon for discount"}
{"text":"If your going to do BFast, there's only one way..With Andrew as your Host a few windows away of the best view in town! Looking at the wacky inflatable tube man in front of Matress firm."}
{"text":"They had me at Premium Bloody Mary with baconThere are plenty of other adult beverages, too. Can't wait to try the food! I'm sure it's worth the great ratings"}
{"text":"Waitress was very cool! This is not about her! However, if an establishment is going to serve vegan food, take it as seriously as us vegans! Serving a pile of dead flesh on top of a vegan order almost felt intentional! And, tasted like rot and barf in a single bite. My daughter received her vegan order, and our orders were placed together on the same ticket, so how does this happen?  Carelessly or intentionally! Obviously, you pretend to care about the animal welfare and the detriment to our planet caused by animal agriculture, but you're only trying to make a few extra sales. As I looked around the room, I saw nothing but unhealthy and grossly overweight patrons, schlepping about as zombies do, and that's when I realized, this is my fault! I will never trust another non vegan establishment. If your establishment really had any interest in making a difference, you'd at the very least stop selling cows milk, especially knowing all the plant based options available today! However, you didn't even go as far as to train your employees to do the right thing! Who really knows if your GF items are GF, who knows if you're serving up the vegetarian options on your menu?? Have you heard of food allergies?  I can't trust your establishment and neither should health conscious patrons. Go vegan or go home!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKED from beginning to end!!! Sat down, ordered drinks... Wife ordered coffee, I ordered lemonade... Got our drinks and coffee was fine but my lemonade was REALLY watered down... Tasted like Iced water w a hint of lemon... Server took our orders... Wife ordered French Toast and Cheesy Potatoes for our son... I ordered Eggs Benedict and seen they had Clam Chowder on the menu, so I had to try a cup of it... Asked server to bring it out b4 our meal and she said ok... About 15mins pass and I had to ask our server AGAIN for my Clam Chowder and she then finally brings it over... Few minutes later all of our food comes... Wife REALLY had to cut into her French Toast, which had no signs of it being dipped in beaten egg wash... It was like toast covered in butter and cinnamon... Crust was soooooo HARD she had to cut it off... I ate through 1side of my Eggs Benedict and it seemed fine, English muffin was a bit soggy as if it was sitting in the hollandaise sauce for awhile... Cut into my 2nd side and my egg was FULLY cooked all the way through, like a hard boiled egg covered w hollandaise sauce on top of a English muffin... Lol... Anyways, this was our first and last time eating at this place... We had to ask for EVERYTHING! Drink refills,Ketchup, Hot Sauce and even Syrup... Only good thing about this place was having toys for your kids..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!!! The restaurant is very cool inside, it only needs a beach n ocean near by. Very cool California feel. Come hungry they give you good portions. The staff was great. Glad I heard about you on the Radio K.S.H.P.. first time in, I look forward to have lunch there.."}
{"text":"Squeeze In was recommended by a nurse at my doctor's office right down the street.  I walked in and was instantly given a small table near the window; this was wonderful since I was able to absorb some vitamin D while eating my breakfast.     Jenna was my server and she was fantastic!  She offered suggestions and made sure that I was taken care of.  I watched her with other customers and her level of service was/is top-notch.  An older couple walked in and seemed thrilled that Jenna was working.  They knew her name and she greeted them warmly.  Jenna, if you read this: You are amazing! My breakfast was delicious, but was made better by your wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I am slightly obsessed with this place. BOTTOMLESS FRIES, pitchers of mimosas, smiling staff, and huge portions. What's not to love?  Walking into this restaurant is similar to walking into my Momma's kitchen. It's homey, bright and fun. The food here is super delicious, and I love that they have vegan options!   I've had sandwiches the last two times I've been, and both were delicious. At our most recent visit the breakfast sandwich, the stuffed French toast, and 2 tuna salad sandwiches. Everyone was thrilled with their orders. I've been craving their fries every since I left! Can't wait to go back and see the smiling faces at squeezed in!   Tip: sign up for their rewards program! They send tons of coupons and deals!"}
{"text":"I'm part of their loyalty program so I get points for things on my visits and offers/coupons in the mail. I like how cozy it is- you really do \"squeeze in\". The plates my family and I have gotten have all been tasty and affordable. I need to try the mimosas next time;)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, first time to this location.  A lot bigger than some of the other Squeeze In locations that we've been to.  Super friendly and attentive staff, huge portions, and excellent food."}
{"text":"This morning was our first time here. We had breakfast and mimosas. Customer service was great. Mimosas was awesome. They definitely do a heavy pour there. Haha. Food was delicious. Our server Andrew was awesome. I recommend this place and we will totally be back!"}
{"text":"I was just here with my boyfriend I had high hopes because of the reviews I read on Yelp. But we were very disappointed. My pancakes were wrong and the ham was severely overdone my boyfriend's potatoes were over cooked his omelette was over cooked the menu was hard to read and our server didn't really helped us even after telling her it was our first time. There was a large group in the back and they were obnoxiously LOUD. This was not a good experience! Perhaps our first and last visit. Over all it was disappointing."}
{"text":"If you want to splurge on breakfast, then, this the place for you! We went here for Christmas Eve breakfast. I wanted to use my birthday promo ($10 off breakfast or lunch- join the Eggheads club online, ***with triple points during our visit, yay!***). It's around the area of Fort Apache and Tropicana, in the corner of a small strip mall. There is seating outside.    I checked out the menu (it's HUGE) several times online, and I was set to order a 'safe dish', biscuits & gravy with eggs, but then I saw the Garth Breakfast Sandwich @ $10.99, a triple-decker sandwich featuring sourdough bread with egg, cheese, and choice of meat- ham, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, fat-free turkey breast, or chorizo, served with spudz (ENDLESS, btw, made in house). Mine was really good, so glad that I changed my mind at the last minute. And the spudz were delish. Seasoned and cooked to yummy perfection. Hubby got an omelet but turned it into a burrito (You can do that with any omelet- 4 eggs, BTW). Hubby ended up splitting, 'cause that's what we do (**but does not count as a split plate charge, fyi**). That burrito was so yummy. The salsa is made in house, too, and it's got a really good flavor. Our son got the teddy bear pancake, topped with fruit (he finished that first), a side of butter, and it came with a drink- he chose orange juice @ $6.79 (*for kids 10 and under*) for the whole shebang. I had a bite of his gigantic pancake, it was light & fluffy, just the way I like them. (Well, it was 4 servings, so yes, we had leftovers, and our son had them the next day, too. We also asked for Spudz to-go, yum.) So, yes, large portions here, and I think that the split plate charge is $1.99, includes additional side.    Lunch looks like a variety of sammies, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and alcohol is served here (mimosas for breakfast).    Our server, Andrew, was the best---he was super nice and attentive. He also asked us if we wanted to try some other sauces for the spudz- cheese, mushroom (this one was my favorite!). All of the other employees were nice, as well. There were a few other customers (OK, we were checking out other people's food), but maybe we got there before the crowd? We were seated next to the baking rack that had the markers to use on the walls, the little toys for the kids, and the (good kind) to-go containers. I went into the bathroom (single stall for each) to wash my hands, and it was really gorgeous (the colors of the tiles, kind of mediterranean). I didn't take my cell phone or else I would've totally shared a picture of it here."}
{"text":"Squeeze In quickly became a favorite place to go. I've never had a bad meal there. The entire staff is always super friendly.  I can highly recommend the Racy Tracy, Twice Baked Scramble, Breakfast BLT and of course the Chocolate Covered Bacon. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I just went to Squeeze In for the first time (Eastern location).  I get my hair done at the salon next door and the salon owner recommended it.  I walked over (with color on and my cape) and ordered a turkey sandwich and garlic fries.  Real turkey breast, large pieces of avocado and the garlic fries were outstanding. It was amazing - and a HUGE portion.  They even brought the sandwich to me at the salon when it was ready (which they only do when they aren't busy).  Justine (who I ordered from) and Jalisa who I also spoke with were great!  This will now be part of my ritual when I go to Studio Khroma (great hair place)!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of really delicious food.  Great service staff...really friendly. We had a hungry larger party and were well taken care of.  Plenty of adult beverage options for breakfast/brunch.  Can't wait to return again and again to try something new off the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Omelette is over stuffed and tasty. Also tried the banana walnut pancakes and they were good too. Large selection on the menu and the service is very good. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The whole reason I went out of my way to try this joint was for Irish Coffees for Sunday Breakfast. The breakfast was comparable to what I can make at home, the Irish Coffee, overwhelmingly disappointing. 1st complaint terrible coffee, 2nd complaint Jameson + coffee does not = Irish Coffee. having Irish decent doesn't make every cup of coffee I pour an Irish Coffee. Drinking on Sunday mornings is how we do in Vegas, next time I'll just have a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"So I have already been there 2 times in a week. Food is really done well with a lot of really cool vegetarian items like chilequilles with tofu. I also loved the triple decker tuna sandwich. My kids love it to with little baskets of toys to keep them busy till the food comes out, which doesn't take long at all. The service was great. Andrew was top notch and made sure we had everything we need. I am sure I will be back on my next day off."}
{"text":"This little brunch spot would fit right in my Cleveland neighborhood! It would be on my list of regulars too! We had a great experience here on our Vegas trip. The service was great as was the food and fun atmosphere. I was surprised they didn't dress up our alcohol drinks, but the important part is they were good! hahah"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced overhyped mediocre food, this is your place.  They pump up the food network appearance.  I ordered the items.  Very mediocre.  Two adults two kids breakfast 64 dollars plus 10 dollar tip.       This place won't last long.  Service is friendly but confused and slow. Food served in approx 40 mins.    Won't be back. Seems popular, lots of young 20 year olds.  So what do I know."}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice fun brekkie or a leisurely brunch.  The decor is generic but the food was absolutely lovely, as was the service.   I had the Crab Benedict and a Bloody Mary and they were amazing!  If you're around town and looking for a family friendly place I highly recommend it...but be prepared to wait, this place is popular!"}
{"text":"The energy and vibe is amazing. So much great food to choose from, the portions are amazing! A must try!"}
{"text":"Allie we love you!! Awesome food, awesome customer service and staff. I loved my mimosa, loved the suggestion for my crabby omelet, and my boyfriend enjoyed his hearty man breakfast loaded with carbs and meat! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I think this one may be a little over rated, the food was good, service was a little slow but the staff was very friendly. To defend them the place was packed and it is very small so getting from table to table can be a bid of a challenge. Just an FYI that if you get the Yelp offer for free drinks and show your waitress to double check your bill, they did not honor the offer."}
{"text":"Picked up breakfast togo and ordered the DJ So cal Low Cal. Now I love overstuffed breakfast burritos but it has to be wrapped correctly. When I opened my togo box the foil was falling apart. When I cut the wrap everything fell apart, that's when I realize the tortilla was wrapped I correctly. The flavor was great and I loved the mushrooms. But once the wrap fell apart all the juice came out and the other half got soggy. BTW my wraps total was $14!!  I've eaten here before and had the oatmeal which was BIG. The condiments they offer was a lot. More toppings than anybody needs."}
{"text":"After eating at Squeeze In in Reno and loving it I was excited to try this location in Vegas. The food and service were okay, but not amazing.  The inside of the restaurant has the same character as other locations with an alien theme. The feel is like a local diner with writing from customers all over the walls.  I ordered the Holy Crab Omelet and the omelet was the highlight of the meal. The eggs were light and fluffy and the omelet was full of crab and cheese. The flavors were great. Spudz on the side were crispy and pretty good. I tried all the sauces offered on the side including cheese, mushroom, and tomato pesto. I strongly disliked every one of these and would pass on the sauces next time. My husband ordered the Trippy Thomas omelet and loved it. The waitress was happy to substitute his toast for tortillas. He added a side of Biscuits & Gravy which fell flat. It reminded me of the biscuits and gravy provided in a complimentary breakfast at a chain hotel. This was really bad. The biscuit was hard, dry, and flavorless. The gravy wasn't much better.  The service was friendly, but not overly attentive. At arrival the hostess was just pointing customers to tables instead of walking them to the table. My husband's food arrived five minutes before mine and another five for my toast after my entrée arrived instead of all of the food arriving together. Our waitress was accommodating in offering to let me try all three sauces and substituting tortillas for my husband.  Overall, the food and service were okay. There are many other outstanding breakfast options in the area so I'm not sure I can say we'll be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch place! Very extensive menu, almost overwhelming. Thankfully Jenna gave us a lot of suggestions and was very attentive and accommodating. We will definitely be back to see her! I recommend getting the flay as a scramble with chorizo and their mimosas are nice and strong!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, the food was very fresh and the area is nice. Located in a strip mall wasn't crowded but it was a weekday. The mimosa was outstanding the place is good! They give you sooooooo much food we weren't able to finish so we took it to go. I will return when I visit Vegas again :-)visit this place you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The service today has been very slow. It took almost ten minutes from the time they sat us down to when they took our drink order. Even when busy, you need to make sure you acknowledge the customer within three minutes of seating the guest.   As I am typing this we have waited almost 45 minutes for our food. I am giving this two stars just because our waitress is friendly.  Another problem is the seating process. A full service restaurant should not just point at a table and tell you to go to that one. You need to take the guest to the table.   This restaurant is not very customer friendly and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Have frequented the restaurant in trucker. A unique place with great food. So I tried the location here, doesn't have the history yet but the food and service help is great and plenty of it. A large unique menu, maybe a little overwhelming at first, but just ask the knowledgeable waitresses. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for Lunch. As we entered inside we met Andrew who greeted us like we had known him for a couple years . This gentleman is amazing ! Talk about a server , Andrew not only made us feel comfortable from the first step thru the door but he chatted about the menu , asked about things we liked and made excellent suggestions. Our food was fantastic & it was my first time there. I will be back . Thank you for great service and terrific food"}
{"text":"Received a coupon so we decided to try this place out...I have to say I was fairly impressed with the portioning!!! The prices seemed a bit high, but when the food arrived it was way more than anticipated...Everything was excellent and our server Jo was on point with her customer service... I ordered the ultimate omelet with pretty everything and the kitchen sink...I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal...my wife had the banana pancakes which her and my daughter only was able to a quarter of the full stack...  We will be coming back as the atmosphere and the food was a delight and fulfilling...thanks again for the meal!!!"}
{"text":"Super fun unique breakfast / lunch spot while visiting Vegas. Service was helpful, friendly, and memorable. The food was delicious. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you love savory yet satisfying palate of flavors for your morning or afternoon, try this little hole in the wall cafe! Huddled in the back in the center where PT's is located on Pebble and Eastern, it was fairly easy to reach. The staff were super friendly as my boyfriend and I walked in today and they were always on top of when things that were needed before we could even ask! The eclectic hippie atmosphere of aliens, Las Vegas symbols and writings on the walls makes it amusing and interesting to look at while we waited for our food to arrive. So far Squeenze In has the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had! I order the Veggie one with avocados, cream cheese and roasted potatoes which were amazing! My boyfriend had the rather large and thick buttermilk pancakes as well! Squeeze In has hypnotized my stomach and we will be definetely making this breakfast place our number one spot and so should you!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I crave pancakes but when I do I want a good helping of it ! I ordered the Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes  (full stack) for $9.99 .The full stack comes with 4 cakes and the short stack has  2  for  $8.49. I ended up sharing them because the portions are huge! The bananas that sit on top are sauteed in butter and honey. I really enjoyed them.  I also ordered the Eric Breakfast Burrito which had scrambled eggs , jack cheese, home made salsa, avocado , bacon , sprouts and sour cream. This is also served with spudz. This isn't your average greasy burrito from the local taco shop. It tastes healthier less grease. Think California style no guacamole but avocado slices.   I love how the hot chocolate was topped with sprinkles .( It's the little things) .The decor is Space Alien Chic and there is writing on the wall with little sayings. It's entertaining to read while you are waiting for your breakfast. The service is  great and helpful! You can sign up for their frequent eater card called the Egghead Club and they don't forget to reward you when your birthday comes around!"}
{"text":"Andrew was amazing! The food was on point as usual  Got the Queen Maggie & Hawaiian Aikane which was a lot for 2 people alone ahaha their portions are humungous but you really get your money's worth .. I love the vibe of the restaurant!  He let me know about the rewards program & even brought me chocolate covered bacon for my birthday  A+++++++"}
{"text":"Being from out of town and visiting Las Vegas, we were looking for a dog friendly restaurant.  We found Squeeze In and hit the jackpot.  Great food, friendly and efficient staff, and a fun environment have made this our go to restaurant  when we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"Went here twice in one weekend! They have an excellent menu with lots of yummy options. The customer service is good, everyone was friendly and gave us insider tips. Go with the hi-mosa of you get a drink."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is the best breakfast in Las Vegas. There are a lot of really good breakfast spots in the valley but this place does it right. They mix flavors together that you would never think of, the biscuits and gravy are out of this world, and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"great food , fresh and tasty! the traditional eggs Benedict and potatoes were super good!! i will be coming back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is just as great as the one I went to in Reno. And the experience was even better considering I didn't go on a weekend. Instead, it was a quiet Monday around 12:30p (they close at 2p). It was just me and my six month old. The restaurant was about two thirds full, but we were seated at a two top immediately. The waitress brought a high chair for my little boy and was nice and attentive.   I was in the mood for something sweet, so I went for their banana pancakes. They're supposed to be filled with walnuts, but I asked for Chocolate chips instead and they gladly swapped them out for no additional charge. The cakes were fluffy and chewy. And the bananas had been perfectly sautéed in butter!   I also got a piece of chocolate covered bacon on the side. It was the perfect combo!! And the coating of chocolate was thick and dark and rich!!  This place also has enormous Omelettes and great potatoes (get them Otis style/covered with cheese)! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for a diner. My coffee was terrible I didn't drink any of it. Stuffed French toast was was literally just cream cheese in bread, lacking in flavor. They forget the avocado and the cheese on  our omelet. Biscuits and gravy was good but not great. Servers were super friendly, only reason I'm not giving a 1 star."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting, I've seen a few suggestions on Yelp, and the pictures looked good. My only regret was not coming here sooner, it's literally next to the Theater and Vegan bites ( which is next on my list) The Atmosphere here is pretty awesome, it has a pretty chilled vibe. The writing on wa says it all. The Aliens welcoming you in, had my little one ecstatic. This place is definitely welcoming to all ages. They even have a few basket of toys for the kids to play with, which totally make sense- kids can get so bored fast just like they get full. So that option of extra entertainment, is a plus for parents who don't have to rush eating once their little one gets bored. The menu option definitely appeals to adults and children- it literally has something for everyone, so dining here makes total sense when your looking for a place to go with the family. The menu selection was pretty good, I was having a hard time deciding on one dish, but I went with the breakfast burrito and surely enjoyed it, my hubby got an omelette with chorizo, and the portion size was pretty good. My kiddo ordered his French Toast combo and cleaned his plate clean. It got a picky eater two thumbs up. First time here? No problem the waitress will take care of you from recommending dishes, to signing up for a rewards program. Which has some pretty awesome perks!  So next time your looking for a kid friendly place to get your breakfast, brunch or lunch on- this is your place. Just make sure to check the time, or you might come to a closed joint."}
{"text":"Nice selection of food, including gluten free and vegetarian. Big portions, but tasty. Their drinks looked interesting, but I didn't see a beer list and it wasn't worth the hassle of asking the waitress. Service wasn't that great. We got there when it opened and ordered drinks right away that took a bit of time to come (coffee and water).  But it took forever for her to come back for our food order. There were only two other tables, but she was busy doing something on the register. It wasn't until one of my friends loudly commented that we hadn't placed our order yet that she finally came over. We'd been there twenty minutes by that point. Just not very prompt or attentive service. Once the second server showed up it got better. The other server is the one that cleared our plates and ran out payment. We'll probably give this place another chance, but if the service is slow again I wouldn't come back. We came here post run and we're hungry."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and big potions. The service is friendly and the decor is eclectic."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I was all watered up to leave a 5 star review! I read all of the previous reviews and I was excited to eat here! I looked at all 170 plus pictures posted on Yelp and could not wait to eat here, did I mention I was excited? Then the moment of truth comes, we've arrived! We were greeted by a nice young lady who told us to seat ourselves, which we did. We were patiently waiting for our server, drooling over all of the options on the menu trying to decide, so many to choose from!. Then another table of people come and another all being greeted and getting their drink orders taken and we're still sitting here. No one greeted us, the server at the two tables on each side of us ignored us as he went from table to table. Nothing! So I can't tell you how awesome the food was or what my recommendation would be, I was hoping it would be one of their benedicts or pancakes or even their homemade biscuits and gravy, but no, I couldn't even get a glass of water. Having been in the hospitality industry, specifically restaurants for 30 years, I've learned to live with disappointment, but no longer. I gave them a shot and they missed the mark, terribly! I will not give them a second chance. Good luck to you if you decide to try this place, it looks like it would have been delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my wife and daughter. My wife buys groupons to new places to get us out of the house and have something to do. We both ordered the Bombshelter Bacon Benny which is their eggs Benedict with bacon, avocado, and mushrooms. Very good! They also offer breakfast style potatoes and you should always go Otis style (add cheese and onions). They were packed but only waited about 10 minutes to get in. Waited kind of a long time for our food but it was worth the wait. I would return and so would my wife. The owner Chris sat us personally and was very personable. Great experience. They are a little pricey for breakfast but again the service and food match the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The morning mimosas were great and the food was excellent! Will definitely return if I am in the area"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast a few days ago and was not impressed. The service was incredibly slow, even though it wasn't busy. I ordered a full stack of the chocolate chip pancakes--portions were huge, the pancakes were alright. I ended up finishing only half a pancake and gave the rest to my friend. After my friend and I asked for the check and a to-go box, we watched as the waitress meandered around to other tables and chatted with patrons, even though we told her we were in a rush. She stops at a table that came in after us, and we overhear her say that she'll comp their meal because of how slow the service is, EVEN THOUGH WE CAME IN BEFORE THEM AND HAD TO WAIT LONGER THAN THEM!!! I hate leaving negative reviews, but I think businesses need to take responsibility when they're not operating fairly, like in this instance."}
{"text":"Came here with my niece to have some breakfast. Decent good food except that the sausage that came with the pancakes and eggs were very burnt and over cooked. Looked like a burnt turd on the pancake.   My breakfast sandwich was amazing. Perfectly cooked and great tasting. I got bacon with mine. The potatoes with onions and cheese was also a great additional side with the sandwich.   My niece didn't eat her sausage because she said it was burnt. At first I thought she was just being a brat and complaining. But after I took a bite and looked at it closer it was extremely over cooked, burnt and dry as could be. I'm actually surprised they would serve that considering their great Yelp reviews.   The servers were extremely nice and gave great service.  Nice trendy little spot."}
{"text":"Great service from the start. They were able to accommodate my table of 9 during prime time hours and food was superb. Friendly staff, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super cool  restaurant. The atmosphere is hip and reminded me of breakfast/lunch restaurants that are located downtown Las Vegas.   The portions are very generous and made for sharing.  Best of all the Bloody Mary's looked yummy!   Servers are very attentive even the ones in other areas take care of everyone!  KUDOS Amy!   Looking forward to the location in the Northwest (Centennial Hills)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing restaurant with delicious food and impeccable service, look no further! I went in and did not know what to get. Luckily my server was very friendly and suggested the Lake Taco. I am very glad he did because it was phenomenal! Also be sure to try one or five of their Bloody Marys, you definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is a lil slice of heaven.( Fort Apache) Squeeze In has a hippy trippy vibe to it and you cant ever dislike a place that has a lil alien cutout watchin you eat. If its good enough for Bobby Flay- well hell, its way gggoood enough for lil ol me. This place is well loved so be ready to wait a few minutes on any given day. Small space plus amazing food = a wait. Plain and simple. Id suggest  spending your time reading the menu because is so awesome that it reads like a book! ( no really yah gotta read thru it)  There is something for everyone from breakfast to brunch to dinner type fare. ( they close at 2pm tho so don't get too wild). They serve alcohol as well, because that's what awesome brunch spots do! Bring your appetite because portions are big and delicious! All you can eat toast or potatoes too. The topping choices are amazing. Ranging from lobster to chorizo to turkey to vegan to pork to.... well you get the idea.  And next time im gettin adventurous and getting peanut butter omelette- yep I said it- peanut butter!!!    Service is amazing- super fun and friendly! I definitely loved this place and plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and excellent food! The portions were very big and the way the inside is decorated is really fun."}
{"text":"MIMOSA PITCHERS!!! great atmosphere and customer service. The stuffed French toast is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Can you give a negative star? DO NOT COME HERE unless you having nothing else to do for the day. extremely long wait time for food, on top of an extremely long wait time to even order. We were seated over an hour ago and we are still waiting for food. Multiple tables around us have left. If management reads this, I urge you to reassess how your business is being run as I am currently looking at a room full of very, very unhappy customers.  Update: management apologized profusely and said it's not normally like this. I felt so bad for the waitress as so many people were unhappy."}
{"text":"Great!  Food was hot and early.  Staff's Mess was excellent.  This is a fantastic delivery breakfast.  Finally found a good delivery breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! The customer service fabulous and the food is just as great! We have been here every week since we discover it! The environment is kid friendly and you don't have to wait long for your food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while visiting some friends last weekend. Not a bad spot for breakfast. Our server was really sweet and all of the staff seemed to enjoy being there. The menu is a little pricey, but the portions are HUGE. My boyfriend and I ended up sharing our food and still did not finish everything.   We were looking forward to the Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes but they were just alright. They tasted like regular pancakes with a few bananas on top and virtually no walnuts (contrary to what was pictured). The Twice Baked Scramble was pretty good.   Overall, it was a decent, new experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out since I live across the street and have been looking for a new place to start having breakfast in the mornings. My experience was pretty awful.   The food presentation was nice. There was also a good amount. It wasn't over the top delicious but pretty decent.   The service is where I had some issues with. I forgot the servers name but she was blonde and seemed new. I asked for water and finally got it after I had to re-ask 3 times. I checked in on yelp and wanted to use the 50% off alcoholic drinks and even though it says that I need to order an entree (which I did) to get the discount she told me I needed to order 2 drinks if I wanted the discount. So I ordered two drinks so I could get the discount.   The time it took to get my food was not acceptable. We sat for almost 1 hour to get our food. The food was fresh and hot when we received it but I don't want to wait an hour to get it.   The checkout..... When we were ready to leave our server gave us our check. I looked to see if we received our discount and it was incorrect. She charged us for extra drinks and gave us the wrong discount. I helped her figure out what was wrong and it took 2 more attempts to show her it was still wrong. There was a difference of $20 from the discount and the wrong items added.   When I asked if it's always this busy on Fridays she said \"Monday's and Tuesdays and slow\". That's great if i was asking about Monday or Tuesday but I was asking about Friday.   This staff needs to be trained more and should keep a notepad with them. I shouldnt need to ask for something 3 times in a row to finally get it. I'm always willing to give a place a second chance but that would only be if I was offered a discount. I'm not going to pay over $50 again to offer a business a second chance."}
{"text":"This is a good hole in the wall, locals spot that serves great breakfast and lunch meals!  Found this place because my friend, who is vegetarian, wanted to go out for breakfast, and I needed to find a restaurant that was going to be accommodating.  They have healthy options, and most entrées start off as vegetarian, and then you can add on meats if you want. They also have an outside patio if you want to bring your pup along!  If you go, Amy is the absolute best out there!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to Squeeze In it's a completely different atmosphere. From the uniforms that the servers wear to the writing and interior decor on the wall - this venue is vibrant, colorful and makes great french toast! When I walked inside I was immediately seated by Jennifer (host). Although the table space I was seated in was a little smaller than I had hoped - the menu I was given was more than what I expected. Each page gave a variety of pictures and detailed descriptions - making it difficult to make a decision. From the Racy Tracy to the Manly Morris there were so many options to choose from. I decided to order the Quintana (Foo) - eggs, turkey sausage with french toast and a side of potatoes. Although the turkey sausage was a little more greasier than I expected - the portion of the french toast was huge but delicious. The sugar was just sweet enough; the side of potatoes were crunchy. I was amazed by the huge portion of side potatoes I was given. The service was quick and polite. I ended up signing up for a card membership and was given a scratch ticket to use for my next visit. I know I will definitely have to try another huge portion of breakfast goodness :)"}
{"text":"This place is very unique! I love how it is different from every breakfast place in Vegas. It has a Denver/California feel to it.  The menu is very diverse and I'm not faced with mundane food choices. I got the Spanish Flay omelette and my boyfriend got this omelette with peanut butter, bacon, apples, and bananas. I definitely had food envy because his omelette was so delicious!!!  Everyone there is very friendly and our server Andrew is great  I plan on coming back to venture out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Went there ordered my food waited 25 mins and the waiter brings my food in a to go box. I was sitting at the table what would make him think i wanted it to go? Then i go home and there's no butter or jam for my toast. So as I'm eating my food i find an eye lash in he over priced food. Great experience"}
{"text":"Squeeze In is a fantastic place with great food, phenomenal customer service, very clean, and an all around good atmosphere. I was thoroughly impressed after my girlfriend made me come here. Now I am a long term fan. Thanks."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today for first time. Andrew was our server and he was great! My husband had the Holy Crab. Made with REAL crab meat. I ordered the Grandpa Marvin's French Dip with turkey instead of roast beef. It was nice to have an alternative since I don't eat beef. Overall, the food was great. The service was amazing. Even signed the wall to mark this day that we are (somewhat patiently) awaiting the arrival of our son, so that we can show him in the future. The bill does add up after add ons and up charges. But the food and service was worth it. Great place and we will return."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite spot in town for breakfast or brunch! The food is outstanding; and they have unique menu items like crab Benedict, and chocolate covered bacon which is definitely worth a try. Also, the wait staff is so friendly; we had Andrew the other day and he was fantastic. I really enjoy the chill vibe with the old school music too... it doesn't feel like like one of those breakfast spots that are all chaotic and noisy. All in all, I truly can't say anything negative about this place, it is my go to when I want to treat myself for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Amazing servers - had a great experience. Loved the Greek omelette and the coffee is nice and strong."}
{"text":"Loved this place, pricey, however worth it!  Easy to share good, tons of it.  Just got a $10 off for my bday."}
{"text":"I treated my mom to breakfast for her birthday the other day. Someone had mentioned this place to us, and since we wanted to try something new, we checked it out. Located in the same parking lot as the Colonnade, next to Body Heat, and the salon, this place is tucked in the corner, but is a hidden gem.   We didn't quite know where the entrance was, but luckily out first guess was the tight guess as if you are going to Vegan Bites, but you just make a little turn to the left. When we walked in the place is cute. Bright colored walls with hand written messages from people who ate there before. The lady told us we can sit where we would like, and we sat next the window and no chair matched the other. Look up and you will see popular Vegas faces and pictures on the ceiling tiles.   When we sat down to take a look at the menu I couldn't help but see how loud it was. So brightly colored with little blurbs here and there. As I was browsing through the menu, everything looked to have eggs in it, and I'm not a huge egg person. But as I searched on I saw and I ordered the Southwestern Spudz - potatoes, black beans, i substituted mushrooms for red bell pepper, tofu (ordered on the side since I'm picky about it), with salsa. The portion was so big! It was like a few people could eat it. I poured a little salsa and dug in and it was just delicious. Everything was paired nicely and didnt seem like there was too much of one thing. I put a little tofu, which was also off the fire and it added a nice crunch to it. I love potatoes and this was just so good. I had to stop myself and ended up taking the rest home. My mom ordered eggs with french toast and turkey sausage bacon.  She really enjoyed hers and said the french toast was not too soggy but just right.   The ladies serving were very nice and helpful. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and what they offered.   Needless to say my mom enjoyed her birthday breakfast. We said we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Well now that I have been there twice I can officially say YES.....the atmosphere is a bit strange with the aliens but getting past that is easy. The waitress's are super friendly and drink servers are on top of it. I tried the Kilemenjaro Ken. Basically grilled cheese, avocado , spinach and bacon. The ingredients were full and fresh. The bread was perfectly grilled and not greasy. I believe it is my new favorite sandwich. I had the french toast the first time and it was delish! Will definitely  be a new go to."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Wait staff is the best. Amy always makes sure our drink reach the table sometimes before us. Andrew always has the best recommendations."}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday and BOY am I glad I did!!! THE FOOD AND SERVICE WAS FLIPPING AMAZING! I ordered a salad and it was by now means just a simple salad.....I definitely will be coming back!!! yum-o"}
{"text":"Thank goodness,  right in our neighborhood.  Food and service was wonderful. My husband says the best potatoes he has ever tasted. It was their grand opening and all tables taken  I'm sure once everyone finds this, it will be on a wait. Became a club member right away. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant in the area!  I must say that I have to have the scramble vs the omelette because I like my ingredients cooked into the egg.  Once I figured that out the place is bomb diggitty"}
{"text":"Upon entering we were slightly confused and just kinda yelled at to \"sit wherever there is a menu\" from a lady who was a bit snippy. But, our waitress was accommodating (we had someone join our party after we'd received our starters.) the food was great, price wasn't anything crazy. The decor is eclectic and has anything and everything (which I personally love)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places now!! Omg this place is bomb. I ordered the Racy Tracy and my boyfriend and I shared the banana walnut pancakes. The portions here are big! Especially the pancakes, we couldn't finish them. The Racy Tracy was okay, but I really loved the banana walnut pancakes. They were fluffy and flavorful.   I feel though it's a little bit pricier than usual breakfast spots, but it is definitely worth it.  Dandy was our server and he was super nice and funny.   We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday with 5 folks and a baby, we got seated after about a 25 min wait.  The food was very fresh and tasty and the server was helpful and professional.  2 reasons they did not make 5 stars: 1.  We clearly ordered nachos as an appetizer, and the server was well aware, and it ended up being served with all the entrees and went right into a To-Go box.  2. It took a looooong time to get the food, like about an hour for eggs/omelets.  I know they are busy, but it was a bit ridiculous.  Overall:  Very good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Can't believe we didn't come here sooner.  My friend and I came here about an hour before they closed on a Wednesday.  It was pretty empty.  I'm sure everyone is at work and/or school.  The decor of the place is unique.  They put a lot of thought into it, it's different then the regular brunch spots.   The server we had was super chill and friendly.  Didn't rush us to order so they can get out of there early.  I had a togo order too.  They didn't start it until we were almost done eating, which is so thoughtful.  Usually people just put the order in and it sits there on the counter until you would finish eating. Ordered the Gluten Free Chicken Soft Tacos togo for my husband.   My friend ordered Egg Benedict with Potatoes.  She said her dish was really good, she ate almost her whole meal.  I like my Breakfast Burrito, it's huge.  I took half of it home with the delicious potatoes.  My husband ended up eating my other half of the burrito.  He enjoyed it.  The soft tacos were too healthy for him at the moment. lol  I realized later after I had one of the tacos that it was made out of corn tortillas, which he doesn't like.  That's the reason why.  I personally like it like that.    Everything overall is great, fast and friendly service.  Portions are big.  They have deals on cocktails too.  We were tempted in getting one but self control... we didn't.  Next time though!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for breakfast. There is no way that you'll leave hungry. We've tried a fair number of things on the menu, all have been excellent. I recommend a ruby fizz (champagne and grapefruit juice) and the Spanish Benedict. We love to come here every couple of weeks to try something new."}
{"text":"Loved the environment and atmosphere here! The staff was energetic and the food....don't get me started! Too late lol Anyway, the food was utterly delicious I personally am a French Toast nerd. I loved that their French Toast was not mushy and drenched in batter! The side bacon definitely is a nice touch extra crispy ;) My mom had the banana pancakes which wee massive! Definitely no hose bar when it comes to portions here. I think everyone should \"Squeeze In\" some time to check this place out! :)   See what I did there?! Lol"}
{"text":"This is a place where I can get my vegan on, and my husband can get his meat thing on! Great atmosphere, people have a great attitude and you can draw all over the walls."}
{"text":"When they say the full stack is a lot of food, just believe them. Breakfast here is awesome, will keep it in our brunch rotation for sure"}
{"text":"Love Squeeze In! Such a hidden gem, nestled in the back corner of this plaza.  The service is always prompt and friendly i have never had a bad experience.   I have tried the Spanish Flay omelette, since I'm a fan of Bobby Flay as soon as I seen this on the menu I had to give it a try. You can't go wrong with the crispy flavorful potatoes and fluffy eggs! I split this dish with a friend and it fed us both very well. The portions here are very large.  On another visit I tried the Jack Johnson, walnut banana pancakes (short stack:2) and let me just tell you I do not like Pancakes and I do not like Bananas... why I decided to order these pancakes I have no idea but I am forever grateful, I now dream of these pancakes. They are that delicious. Even the short stack is way too much food for me so the second visit I was able to order a single pancake and found that much easier to eat. Since I don't tend to take pancakes to go.. And they don't hold up too well reheated once you have syrup and butter on them.. let me add another thing! This pancake is topped with warm butter and honey. Truly dreamy! It's like banana nut bread in a pancake, yum!  I've also tried the Classic Eggs Benedict, served alongside those delicious crispy potatoes is another delicious staple. And their hollandaise sauce is fabulous, it makes the dish. Another favorite at Squeeze In would be their mimosa with guava juice, it's a must try! And they have great deals if you order two at the same time it's $10.99 for both I believe. They are not stingy with the champagne, they fill their glasses to the top. My kinda place!  I highly suggest signing up for their Squeeze In card. They have weekly specials that are always a great deal.  Can't wait to get back to Squeeze In for another dreamy Banana Pancake and guava Mimosa... maybe one of these days I'll order something else on the menu... which will probably be out of this world delicious like everything else."}
{"text":"Drove a long way here at 12:50pm & the restaurant is closed. On yelp it saids it's open till 2:00pm. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"AS good as the one in South Reno. Kudos to management for hiring the right people (server & cooks)! Obviously if in Vegas I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Food, Awesome! Atmosphere, Hippy-Comfy! Service, Like being at home!"}
{"text":"If you order take out and you arrive when you're prompted, there's a possibility you'll wait 35 more minutes."}
{"text":"Was great food and awesome service .. they even have a small Vegan menu. Great food !!!!"}
{"text":"Their omelets are huge. The service was a little slow at times and they seem to up charge for all the little stuff. However with all the selections at this place you are bound to find something you like."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations in every way! The waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and had lots of good recommendations. The menu itself was unique with a very cool, modern design filled with lots of creative dishes. The omelette I had was with seasoned ground beef, scallions, mushrooms and to complement the flavors, a really tasty tomato pesto sauce. I opted instead of toast for a banana, walnut pancake which was out of sight. Best breakfast place hidden among the outskirts of sin city reminds one of the many layers that Vegas has for the most discerning of palates."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast spot! Twice baked scramble is amazing and they have gluten free options. Great mimosas and lots of fresh fruit. The staff is always friendly and positive and always welcoming. It's a great spot to cozy up to."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this placed and we met there for lunch....what a wonderful spot!  The staff is awesome and they have a loyalty program!  Food was so delicious and there are so many options!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Meh the chocolate covered bacon was ok food was just ok and I didn't make it home before I got sick from it. . I would not recommend"}
{"text":"I have found a new BEST BREAKFAST in Vegas spot. I want to start with this, the portions are massive, so the prices everyone is talking about really match the amount of food you get. We paid a lot for our meal, but there is a much smarter way to order for our family, so going back and spending much less if definitely possible. I had the Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes and they were yummy. The kids had choco chip pancakes, which they scarfed down (as much as the could at least) they will probably share an order next time. I also had the chocolate bacon, yes I said CHOCOLATE BACON! It was great. My wife had their gravy biscuits and loved them too. We will definitely be back, and I highly recommend a visit. Just be conscious of portion sizes and order appropriately and price should not be an issue."}
{"text":"A new breakfast spot in southwest side of Las Vegas...the decor and service was great food wise...I honestly have to come back to try an omelette to give my honest opinion.  The pancake (I forgot the name of it) was one if the best I've had here in Vegas with lots and lots of walnuts inside topped off with bananas.  The turkey sausage was good but we did have an issue that was taken care if but still shouldn't happen...my wife had a crab benny and she had shell that was left behind with including a piece of a knuckle...she the taste was off as well....the only pet peeve...no booths or comfortable chairs the tables seem too small...but will be back to give it another chance...in sure you guys deserve it."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE KICKS ASS! Literally the best omelettes I've ever had! I met the owner one day in my restaurant Curry Leaf, and when she told me this place was opening I HAD to go check it out. Gonna bring everyone here for our after-party hangover food! I just love how they have \"adult beverages\" for those who like alcohol with their pancakes! Ah! Must go!!!"}
{"text":"we came on saturday Sept 23 about 11:30am we still had not recieved our food. bu 12:30 but seen other people come well after us and recieved their food I hate to pull the race card but we are African American could that have been the reason?? we left just paid for our coffee and milk so sad because the food looked delicious to bad we will NEVER EVER. come again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the area and decided we wanted some breakfast and since the reviews were so good we decided to try Squeeze. I had the French toast and my girlfriend had the stuffed French toast. My French toast was okay. Nothing amazing. Just French toast you could get anywhere. The stuffed French toast was pathetic. It was just normal toast cut in half with a slice of cream cheese in the middle. Yes a slice.  It wasn't even a filling. Service was okay. Nothing great. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"4 egg omelets just can't be beat (no pun intended:). I've decided the pastrami or \"the sarge\" I think they call it is my fave, but also on the list is the one with turkey breast. Today though I'm trying the \"Jeremiah\" with added chix. The kid is having the \"bonjour\" with French Toast and sausage, the wife I noticed is hooked on the \"Colin\" burger with garlic gries.  What really stands out and makes us keep coming back is our server and his excellent service with and even better personality. He already knows who we are and makes us feel welcome. Aside from that is there generous reward program where they send gift certificate for a complimentary dish for each of your family member and also another one for your anniversary, good for that whole month :)."}
{"text":"The menu can be overwhelming. It's as eclectic as the decor that Squeeze In. Came here after a pilates class with a friend for breakfast. She discovered it after going to the vegan bakery that's right next door. Their menu is huge with all sorts of strange, wacky combinations that they take pride in showcasing. I have the Racy Tracy which was a dish that was featured on Food Network. Showdown thing with Bobby Flay. The omelet was nice and fluffy. The avocado was perfectly ripe. And the potatoes on this side or seasoned so delicious...crispy perfection... Just like home-style potatoes should be. I I had the Virgin Bloody Mary and it was delicious. With a check in you will get a free Bloody Mary or mimosa. I'm saving that for the next time I want the real Bloody Mary and not the virgin. Service was friendly and the rest rooms were clean. So it was a great choice today!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews, but I feel this is warranted. This place is on the way to my office, so I figured I'd stop by and try something new. The first thing that caught my eye was the Spanish Flay, the picture looked really good, it had everything that I liked in an omelet. I wish I had dined in but I couldn't so I chose to get it to go.   The staff was really friendly and accommodating, so I have no problem with them. My problem was the food it tasted terrible and for $15 I deserved better. The omelet was big but it wasn't stuffed with adequate fillings, and it lacked seasoning. Same goes for the potatoes, just tasted bland. What's worse was that I was expecting was cheese sauce on the potatoes and instead I got cheese whiz. That killed it for me.  Most likely I won't be back after this, there are other places nearby that I can choose from."}
{"text":"The service and the food are amazing!! The portions are HUGE and the drinks are strong. They also have a frequent customer card. Where you rack up points. I definitely will go back. Awesome breakfast lunch brunch spot. You can also write in the walls."}
{"text":"Love this place! Previously eaten at their Pebble location, which is just as tasty. It's nice to have some new dishes when it comes to breakfast spots and all awesome ingredients which is a big plus for me. Friendly staff, good food. Boom."}
{"text":"This place has an extensive menu, so much to choose from. Even better, they also cater to goofy dietary restrictions. I decided to go with a breakfast burrito. It was a bit bland for my liking, so I asked for something spicy. The best was hot sauce, which is heavier on the vinegar taste. Our server was friendly and it was a cool looking spot. I'm gonna keep coming back until I find something I can rave about."}
{"text":"Sorry to say , the place is cute, the server was pleasant, but the food was overpriced and pretty bad. I had the breakfast sandwich which was mostly bacon, couldn't identify any egg on there and a Slab of American cheese. Underwhelmed...it's our second try there..."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and decided to try something off the strip.   I had the King Crab Bennys...OMG they were delicious. The crab was sauteed in butter and was so tasty. The portions are huge. The potatoes were enough to feed 2. They add an entire avocado!   Service was awesome. All the servers help eachother so you don't have to wait for your server to come around.   It was a bit of a drive from the Vegas strip for breakfast but so worth it. Plenty of parking.  Mimomas and bloody marys! They close at 2 pm. We got here at 1:00 pm and there was not wait.   Would definitely venture this way again."}
{"text":"How can you give any restaurant 5 stars and never have been there! Here's why! Met Jo at opening day of the Miracle League in Las Vegas! They were giving out free bacon strips! Told them about Toys 4 Smiles having an open house October 5. They donated three packages for silent auction! The way they immediately reached out to help our local charity I know the restaurant will be great! Thanks to Jo and the entire Squeeze In family!"}
{"text":"Foods amazing!! Drinks amazing!! Service amazing!! We have been here a few times and everything has been consistent. If you are looking for an upbeat environment to make your Sunday morning perfect this is the place!! Amy J. You rock !! Had us laughing and mad sure everything was perfect!! This is our spot now!!"}
{"text":"My good buddy, who happens to be the un-deserving duke of Squeeze In, had been wanting us to try it for months...and today was finally the day of reckoning.   The decor was awesome and unique. The staff was very cool and seemed like they enjoyed working there. And the food was phenomenal. The menu was overwhelming because everything looked fantastic. I went with the breakfast burrito and my wife got the pancakes.   It lived up to the high expectations and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and delicious breakfast/brunch experience."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to and no wait time (11am) on a Sunday morning. Prices are reasonable for their portions. And food was good as well."}
{"text":"as a local restaurant owner myself I tend to be critical and demanding of restaurants. This being said I believe this will be my new favorite spot- service= friendly-high energy-polite and on it! ambiance= really cool-I award the creativity and uniqueness Menu= amazing- well laid out-lots of variety Food Quality= absolutely top notch! super small kitchen cranks it out even on a Sunday! and I finally found a place or at least a server-(Frankie) that asks before refilling your coffee- which totally destroys the cream to java ratio!"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating at Squeeze In and we will be back! Andrew, our server, provided excellent service. He was welcoming, informative, and guided us through choosing our perfect meal. The large menu has options for everyone, including a vegan and lower calorie menu. The Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes are a must. Andrew offered a side of one pancake with my husband's meal. Our group left happy and completely stuffed!"}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and never been disappointed with the food or service.   The servings are very large and could easily be shared or taken as leftovers and I love the hi-mosas. They have traditional breakfast and lunch meals but also wacky fun meals too, always great to try new things!  I've always been happy on my multiple trips to Squeeze In until today...I had to leave and come back and by the time I got back there was a line (very popular place) and I was upset (probably hangry too) and the hostess Jade noticed and stepped right up and made everything better. She handled it perfectly and managed to put a smile on my grumpy face, she really did turn my whole experience around. Then my server Mel was so nice and so attentive that it was just the cherry on top of the cake.   Overall, I've always loved Squeeze In due to the quality and value of the food but today the service really made me smile and I wish I could give it 10 stars. Thank you Jade and Mel!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great place with great food and great prices. What really makes it great is the warm and welcoming staff. I love the quirky atmosphere and fun colors. The food takes a bit to come out but trust me it's worth it for the great quality of food you will receive. Can't wait to go back! I tried the Racy Tracy and I was great! Drink specials are awesome as well."}
{"text":"Both my fiance and I had the omelette which was featured on TV.   The omelettes were delicious and the mushroom sauce was great.   The service was great.   I have two complaints. One, as great as the menu looked it is clear the hash browns came out of a bag and were not homemade. The hash browns were not good.   Two, I paid $45 (including a 20% tip) for the two omelettes and one cup of coffee.   Despite my complaints I would try this place again."}
{"text":"1st time here. Great service and really good food. The YELP post for free mimosa was appreciated."}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the least!!  This was my first and last visit to this establishment.   During my visit I ordered the the short stack of buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and a peach Bellini. However, in regards to my short stack of pancakes I never received it while waiting at this restaurant for an hour and a half. My order was never completed even after telling my waiter four times that I was still waiting on my short stack of pancakes. The only thing I ever received was I'm sorry they're working on it, I'm sorry they're working on it but then other tables around me receive their pancakes and their orders.   The other members of my party had multiple issues with their orders and the service as well. I'm brother ordered turkey sausage but it said he got pork sausage we also ordered the Nutella French toast and that came out after all of our food came out which was ordered as an appetizer. Needless to say that I had to leave and find anothet place to eat for the day.  Ultimately,  I am highly disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Blind Dog Coffee Buttermilk Biscuit Jack Johnson Banana Walnut Pancakes - Buttermilk Pancakes with Walnuts Cooked inside, topped with Bananas sautéed in Butter and Honey Queen Maggie - French Toast stuffed with Cream Cheese, crowned with Strawberries, Bananas, Cinnamon and Powdered Sugar  Open for just over a month on Fort Apache near Tropicana, an import originally from Truckee California but since expanding to Reno, Sparks, Redwood City and now Las Vegas, Squeeze In promotes itself as offering the \"Best Omelettes on the Planet\" and having bested Bobby Flay en route to franchising opportunities a first look at the concept shows a restaurant willing to have some fun while still taking the right steps to be successful.  Differentiating itself from the pack by way of design as well as offerings, the menu one of those multi-page affairs that at first makes experienced diners cringe but quickly reveals itself to be intelligently crafted to use a limited number of ingredients in creative manners in order to create hundreds of types of Omelettes and Sandwiches plus some Skillets, Griddles, Soups, Salads and more, the décor at Squeeze In is best described as a ramshackle array of hippie nostalgia, everything from records and bicycles hung amidst road signs with cutouts of Aliens displayed prominently as customers are also invited to scrawl their own art on the walls.  Open at 7am daily and reportedly packed to capacity from nine o'clock until closing on weekends thus far, it was just after 7:15 that entry was made to the place where 70s and 80s rock plays loudly overhead and greeted by a cheerful hostess before being handed off to a young man named Andrew the waitstaff was unexpectedly excellent, the restaurant apparently already generating regulars greeted by name while everyone who entered was treated to service with a smile and beverages frequently refilled.  Not afraid to brand itself and embrace social media, the Egghead Club and #squeezeinfun prominently promoted with \"points\" offered for dollars spent, surveys and online reviews, it was after lengthy perusal of the menu that an order was determined, a $5 welcoming coupon plus free beverage by way of Yelp! bringing the total to just $25 after tax and tip for a substantial amount of food.  Joking with customers in a jovial way while pouring cup after cup of good coffee roasted by Reno's  Blind Dog throughout the stay, it was perhaps fifteen minutes after ordering that plates arrived from the kitchen and with Free Wi-Fi available to pass the time as everything from Golden Earring to The Scorpions played first bites of the \"Jack Johnson Pancakes\" more than lived up to the billing as the Buttermilk four-stack was still fluffy despite a liberal dotting of Walnuts beneath a layer of melted Butter and Honey-kissed Bananas.  Having brought 100% Maple Syrup from home only to realize that Squeeze In steps up their game by offering their own at a supplementary cost, Queen Maggie French Toast proved a bit less impressive than it could have been since the quick sear had failed to melt Cream Cheese in more than half of the six slices, though the dish still remained a winner based on the Bread quality and the Eggy Custard in which it was soaked.  Finishing up with a respectable oversized biscuit, the somewhat flattened oval in no way indicating a lack of flavor, though a lack of layering sees it fall short of the Valley's best, suffice it to say that leftovers are likely to follow most diners home from a breakfast at Squeeze In, an average family of four probably quite safe to share two entrees and be perfectly happy strolling out the door.  FOUR STARS:  Already out-performing several of Las Vegas \"best\" breakfast spots in terms of scene, service and selections, Squeeze In enters an already busy scene with big aspirations that it seems ready to pursue with diligence, a few minor tweaks likely all it needs to see continuing lines and ongoing success."}
{"text":"Items Ordered: Coffee Zweifel - Apples and Bananas Sauteed in Butter and Honey, folded into an Omelette with Peanut Butter and Bacon (+$1.59) plus Crispy Potatoes and an English Muffin Salty Sweet Chocolate Covered Bacon Sophia's Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes - Short Stack with Blueberries (+$0.99)  Now featuring two locations in Southern Nevada, the concept out of Truckee California opening its first in July 2016 near the junction of Fort Apache and Tropicana, it was with morning business nearby that a stop was made at Squeeze-In on South Eastern Avenue near Truffles n' Bacon Café, the restaurant known for the \"Best Omelettes on the Planet\" and a televised triumph over Bobby Flay showing consistency in the branding, but not in the overall customer experience.  Tucked into the back corner of a shopping plaza next to a Vegan Café, the shopping center jumping that morning thanks to a Tent Sale from a nearby Home Goods vendor, it was just past eight in the morning that two aliens were passed en route to the door, a smiling hostess greeting patrons and offering seating amidst a room decorated in kitsch and guest comments written in Sharpie on the wall.  Not the sort of restaurant going all-in on the Artisan idea, but rather the sort of place with a colorful menu built on classic diner food updated with some twists, it was with particular items plus a $10 \"Egghead Club\" discount voucher that a seat was taken along the back window, the hostess inexplicably placing a loud family with a father who smelled like a freshly sparked joint directly behind me only a minute later despite plenty of room to spare.  Already having made decisions, a cup of Coffee poured and refilled only after verbal requests throughout the morning, it was shortly after seating that a three-part order was placed to the response of \"you must be hungry,\" the music playing overhead ranging from Pop to Classic Rock at a level that never grew too loud with Free Wi-Fi providing available to those who arrive during longer wait times, though there was barely time to log-in before Breakfast plates began arriving.  Taking the valued step of offering Pure Maple Syrup at a supplementary charge, though this uncommon local practice had already caused some to be brought from home, it was with all three dishes deserved simultaneously that photos were snapped and items dressed to taste, the Chocolate covered Bacon arriving ice-cold with a squeeze of Whipped Cream and Berries that were added to the Short-Stack, the flavor of the Pork mostly lost amidst the coating, and mostly detectable in the lightly saline finish.  Focusing next on the Pancakes, the body not quite as fluffy as the Jack Johnson inspired version tasted in August, it bears mention that for ninety-nine cents the amount of Blueberries present in the Batter was greater than one might expect even though the cup of Butter was quite small, the portion size of a dish entitled Zweifel far more substantial as three whole Eggs are folded around an admixture of softened Fruit, Honey and a creamy Peanut Butter with the addition of at least two chopped slices of Bacon providing a textural variance that was actually quite pleasant, the eggs admittedly lost in the background and almost acting as a 'wrap' in this instance while the Spuds were crisp and not oily, though something besides High Fructose Corn Syrup-laden Smucker's would have been nice to have for the toasted English Muffin.  ***  Lacking the friendly and efficient customer service of the location on the West Side, but still providing a decent breakfast at a fair price, Squeeze-In on Easterm provides yet another alternative to the Egg & I's, Cracked Egg and Baby Cakes of Sin City with a focus on Omelettes that come in an almost infinite array of possibilities."}
{"text":"We had an awesome breakfast and the staff could not have been nicer, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am sitting here right now while my stomach is eating itself. We were seated right away, although the place seemed busy. I thought that we were off to a great start! I was excited because their menu has a lot of vegetarian options. It took a while for someone to get our drink orders, I actually had to get her attention. Same with the food order. For whatever reason, everyone else that sat down AFTER us has already gotten their food. We asked someone to check on our order, and she came back and said the kitchen has half of the order made, and still making the other half. What does that even mean? Either one of our food orders will be cold, or has been sitting under the heating lamp for a while. Mind you, we only ordered a veggie Benny and a burrito. Shouldn't be that complicated. We got our food, and it was decent. They were nice enough to take $10 off our bill due to the wait. We were there for an hour and a half. As nice as the employees were, I don't think we will be going back. It was quite disappointing to have waited that long for okay food."}
{"text":"I had the half order of biscuits and gravy and it was pretty good, but I think it needed a little more gravy. Overall atmosphere was good and service was nice and very fast."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place and I loved it! Very kids friendly. They even had a basket full of toys for little kids to play!  Foods were great and service was good!"}
{"text":"So much variety, and everything we've tried so far has been 8/10 or better. Do yourself a favor, order the chocolate covered bacon right away, and let it rest at room temp until the end of your meal. They hold and serve it ice cold, which masks the bacon flavor, but once the chill is off it is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. Its hard to find a place that combines alcohol and good vegan food."}
{"text":"Great service, huge portions, not cheap but not ridiculously expensive either, great flavor, etc. Went here yesterday based on reviews for the first time for my birthday with my sister and brother in law for breakfast. The wait was 20 minutes - not bad. I think my only minor complaint was it was so bright in the room and you could barely feel the a/c - the 3 of us were hot the whole time. We all checked in so we got a free drink which was part of their yelp special. We ordered the queen margaret french toast with fruit and cream cheese inside, the montana spanish breakfast platter, the banana walnut pancakes, the eggs benedict and the racy tracy. Every dish was superb! Lots of left overs. We will definitely be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. Ridiculous portions and it's all just so good! Their waitstaff is fantastic and friendly. Never have had a bad meal yet"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Get the veggie omelet with potatoes. All gluten free and delicious. Highly recommend. Jenna has great service too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times it was later in the afternoon on a Sunday - probably an hour or so before closing time. The first experience was good, a solid 3 stars. Food was good, service was mostly good. None of the hiccups were deal breakers so my friend and I decided to return yesterday for lunch. When I walked in, 2 ladies were working on something on the computer and it took them a few minutes to greet me and get me a table. Our server was a really gracious man and took good care of us, despite some issues in the kitchen. It took the food a long time to come out and when my friend got hers, it was completely wrong. Her turkey sandwich had zero turkey on it! We chalked it up to almost being closing time and people wanting to go home. All in all, this is a decent breakfast spot but the overall service has been spotty both times I've been in. It's not a cheap breakfast so although I won't exclude it completely, it's not going to be top of my list of spots to hit."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was even better. Stop in and give them a try. I had the omelet that was guy fiery had on diners, drive ins and dives."}
{"text":"Great food, just like their restaurants in northern Nevada but a bit pricey. $20 for breakfast for one is a bit much.  Stopped by for my birthday breakfast. Had the Lake Taco Omelet. Fantastic flavor! Dandy provided great service!!"}
{"text":"The corned beef special featured the BEST corned beef I have ever tasted!  It was REAL corned beef, not that Deli crap. The eggs were perfect, potatoes cooked and perfect seasoned. The only negatives were they only have 2 people running this place and the wheat toast was stale. It's definitely worth a return trip"}
{"text":"Had the holy crab omelet it was soooo good. Customer service was great and food was fresh and hot. We from the bay area I just learned they have one out there. We will be stopping by when we get home. Love this place...."}
{"text":"Food was great with friendly service! We will definitely be back. Such a fun atmosphere getting to sign the wall."}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait on a Sunday morning but everything was delicious! The portions are huge but it didn't stop by boyfriend and I from getting everything we could. When we walked in it reminded us of the restaurants in hait and ashbury in San Diego. We got one of the scrambles, their homemade biscuits and gravy and the banana pancakes with walnuts were definitely my favorite. We signed up for their membership and get 20 dollars off our next meal! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast place in LV! I love the staff and the food! I don't like living in Las Vegas but I feel at home whenever I come here!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check out something different and wow! We made the right choice. Everyone working was extremely kind and relaxed. They were training a new server and even the woman doing the training was 100% on point and held down the whole room like a boss.  Now for the grub- soooo good. I don't eat eggs but this menu had some really great and unique offerings for me. I tried one of the vegan dishes which had potatoes, broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms and black beans with a side of salsa. So good and a huge filling portion. My kiddo had the teddy bear pancake and the batter was delicious. Finally, his Dad ate the eggs benny special of the day with 3 poached eggs, bacon, ham and chipotle hollandaise. He said it was AMAZING!  So go right now and try this place out. Super casual, kitschy and great for kids too!"}
{"text":"Great food, big portions.  But each of the items we ordered were top notch.  Need to go back and try the French toast, because the order at the next table made me jealous.   Staff was friendly and helpful.  Loved the alien look of the place with just the right amount of Vegas nostalgia. You will love it and the price is right.  Thanks for coming to Vegas and so close to home."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot!! Food was amazing & our server Andrew was great!! I will definitely be a regular here now"}
{"text":"Love this place - and YELP, I really don't give a shit if an establishment has neutral restrooms."}
{"text":"I sat myself in a corner table, ordered an irish coffee with whipped cream! Then had the tuna melt with garlic fries  My server was Dandy. Yes,That's his name, He lives up to it! It was an awesome date for myself, I don't normally go out to lunch, but I'm very happy that I did! Thank you"}
{"text":"The resturaunt had 3 other tables with customers. So not busy. The restroom was dirty. The foid was fair at best. Very pricey. I received the bill and gave the server my cc, went to the restroom   Upon return my girlfriend had signed my charge. I picked up the receipt and noticed that the charge slip was $12.00 more than the Bill. So a bill that was $20.00 jumped to $32.00."}
{"text":"Andrews Authentico sandwich is a must try!!! yummy sandwich. we love this place!!! fun place for a break from the monontany"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here & only because they sent me a card for my birthday giving me $10 towards any breakfast or lunch. Considering everything on their menu is around $15 for breakfast & lunch...the least they could have done was give me a free entree. Anyway, service was great, food...not too good ! I had the pancakes w bacon & scrambled eggs. The eggs looked funny...something was different about them, needless to say I didn't eat them! These eggs look cold, watery & just plain gross! I didn't say anything, I just won't be back. Their prices are over rated anyway... Pancakes were good & the bacon ..."}
{"text":"Holy Crap!   Food was 4 stars.  Customer service and booze 10 stars!  Seriously I had a picture of the peach belleni (sp) that went down like water but was 100% booze.  This place does not mess around with alcohol it is definitely my kind of place and I will definitely be back.  I actually can't imagine going anywhere else now for breakfast with a friend when we want cocktails !"}
{"text":"The food is quite good. Honestly very tasty...once it finally arrives. We've been here about 5 times now, mainly because there are vegan options for me, but the cook times are really unreasonable. Every time I come here, I ask myself why I'm back. I really hope they work to refine their system because the food really is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service, huge portions, did I mention great service?? Best hidden gem in our neighborhood!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Squeeze In was a great surprise!! Not only was the menu great, the atmosphere and service was just as awesome! We split an omelette and it was plenty! I will be returning guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, they all greet you as soon as you come in the door. Large menu with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. Huge portions of food and is reasonable in price. great place!"}
{"text":"Great service and tons of food choices!! I loved their chocolate bacon dish and definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Everything sounded so good it took me forever to finally figure out what I wanted. Make sure to sign up for free gift cards"}
{"text":"Came to this breakfast spot on a whim. I'm glad we came. The menus is HUGE, I ended up only looking at the omelette section as that seems to be their claim to fame. I wanted to get the Racy Tracy but my husband ordered it. So I put myself out there and got the Cathy Who - ham, bacon, cream cheese and bananas sautéed in honey and butter. Yes folks, that was an omelette. I was skeptical but it was better than expected. It was actually good. I would say I prefer the the Racy Tracy as the flavors were more familiar and I'm a sucker for avocado.  These are 4 egg omelettes that are stuffed with ingredients. Absolutely STUFFED. We took leftovers home.  One of the highlights would be the mimosa flight, 3 glasses of mimosa with different flavors. We chose mango, orange, and pomegranate/pineapple. There was plenty of champagne and honestly each glass was the amount of a champagne flute. All for a total of $11.  The low for me was the biscuit. It was a biggest larger than my hand, but it really didn't have much flavor. I had one bite and that was more than enough of that."}
{"text":"So glad to finally visit this place in Vegas. Our daughter took us to the one in Reno months back, and we had fallen in loved with the food, coffee and the over all experience, needless to say, we had high expectations. Glad to say, it did not dissapoint! Hubby had one of the Eggs Benedict dishes, he loved it. Specially the potatoes which he said were hot, crispy on the outside soft on the inside and seasoned just right. Unfortunately i have strict dietary restrictions, so usually i am not too excited about going out to eat anymore. Its not only food options, but ingredients, seasoning, and your regular worries like fat, carb, salt and protein content. As well as sizes offered,  option to order from child menus or being able to swap sides for healthier options. So glad to report that these guys in both occasions have been extremely patient, accommodating and even made suggestions. Considering this, obviously i couldnt order one of their delicious popular omelets or the wonderful banana nut pankacakes (which my husband had ordered before) but i dont feel like i missed out on anything with my dish. I ordered the Shi's Super Scramble which is made with broccoli, zucchini, spinach, red peppers, egg whites and turkey sausage (which is an add-on but totally worth it if you need to add extra protein to your dish), and a fresh fruit cup on the side. The vegetables were cooked just right with that needed bit of crunch. The egg-veggie-turkey portions were perfectly balanced and i couldnt even tell i was having egg whites since the dish was still hearty, tasty and extremely fullfilling. I ended up having left overs which were enough for my dinner that same night and breakfast the next day. Our server was outgoing, courteous and kept checking on us during our meal.  The restaurant has unique decor, which makes it a casual yet fun, comfortable and \"familiar\" feeling. Great for bff get-togethers, big family breakfasts, date with your significant other,  or just eating solo in an environment were you can still feel comfortable and welcomed."}
{"text":"Edit - April 2017: so sad that we have to edit this review. We really did love this place, but with its growing popularity came a severe decline in service, and taste.  The breakfast potatoes are flavorless, where they were once part of the highlights. The food wasn't hot - the cheese on my burrito wasn't even melted. They forgot the ham in hubby's omelette too. Every time we have a poor experience I convince honey to give them another chance. We even spoke with Andrew about our experiences last time we were in. I'm pretty sure, with the plethora of breakfast options out there, we won't be back for awhile.    Previous review: Another excellent breakfast at Squeeze In! The service is amazing, the food is hot and fresh. This place is quickly becoming a regular spot for us! Thanks for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  But don't take my word for it, I don't want to wait in line for a table.  Kim was so welcoming and she wasn't even our server.  The attentiveness of the service here is amazing and Andrew took care of us very well.  I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a great brunch, the menu is also hilarious but has a lovely variety."}
{"text":"First time here!! Delicious! So much to choose from! And Andrew was very nice!  My Hi-Mosa was perfect! Thank you for making our first experience great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My bf and I tried this place out for brunch on a Saturday and were seated as soon as we walked in! The place definitely has a cool and quirky vibe to it like customer writing all over the walls and home-style kitchen tables that made it feel personable.   Be prepared that the menu is huge - seriously so many different options! We ordered the Spanish Flay omelette with turkey sausage and the Queen Maggie French Toast. I'm glad our server let us know ahead of time that the portions are ginormous and that I would definitely have some left overs after (she was right lol.)   We also checked in and received free mimosas with our order, which was a great perk! I got the Hi-Mosa (champagne, orange and cranberry juice) and my bf got the the Hibiscus (cranberry juice and champagne). I totally agree with another reviewer who said that the drinks are 98% alcohol and 2% juice; you can definitely tell that they are generous with the amount of alcohol! Haha   Overall we had a great experience and the customer service was great. The food is definitely on the pricier side but still worth a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat breakfast, the food was delish and the staff were friendly and attentive. They're always going around with a pot of coffee ready to fill your cup. And as much as they were packed, we were seated right away. Our food came right away too!  Had the stuffed French toast and it was just perfect!  Will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"If you look up \"disorganized\" in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of Squeeze In. No hostess, just sign yourself in. Maybe you'll get a table but don't bet on it. Much better places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go.  Just reading the menu is a treat in and of itself.  Went there after church on 8/27 at 12:00.  Place was crowded but we were seated right away.  I had the Racy Tracy (what's not to love about it) and my friend got  the special which had Spam, Eggs, Pineapple, Sirachaa sauce and more (ok-started with SPAM need I say more).  We actually got the last one before they sold out.  We shared so that we could try both.  But let's get  to the best part - Our Waitress Frankie.  This gal is stellar.  Fantastic Service, Great Recommendations, Happy and Effiecient.  They have a gem in this gal.   She made this the BEST experience ever.  In my world it's all about the service and Frankie gets my vote. Yep the food is great, yep the place is fun but I will keep coming back because of the great staff, expecially Frankie!"}
{"text":"Not bad. We came here for the first time today and really enjoyed ourselves. We got seated right away (it was about 11:00a on a Saturday). We were server our waters quickly. And then our orders were taken quickly.   Hubby had the chorizo scramble (something Aztec). Thryblet him grt all thrbdipping sides hr wanted. So he chose nacho cheese, tomato pesto, and green salsa. I had the special burger with swiss cheese, mushrooms, and avocado, and side of garlic French fries.  Both dishes were great! It was hard to eat my burger on account of everything always falling out of it. But hey, \"if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" reminded the hubby.  Even the wheat toast was super good. But probably because it was drenched in butter. You can never go wrong with buttered toast with strawberry jam.   We ended up signing up for a rewards card or something. It gives you free cocktails next time and 10% off your next meal I think? But we'll be back. So we'll put the card to good use."}
{"text":"A great little spot tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center! We were looking to venture beyond usual breakfast spots, and I found a Groupon for Squeeze Inn. I'm so glad we did! The service was friendly and efficient; we were greeted almost as soon as we crossed the threshold! It's a bright, cheery restaurant, with lots of natural light, and plenty of decorations to catch our daughter's attention. The menu is diverse, and they allow substitutions; heck, they even offer suggestions! Hubs had the twice- baked scramble, which was too much to finish, and I had eggs benedict with potato pancakes as the base. Both were yummy, and we're looking forward to trying some of their famous omelettes next time.  Give it a shot; you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Just finished up brunch here and it wasn't the best experience. Place seems very clutter and service was bad. Ended up finding a black hair in my fruit cup."}
{"text":"This cool, laid back, fun place has options for everyone, from veggie, gluten free and meat lovers. The staff is amazing. We picked their brains for some hot spots for my cousin's 21st bday and they nailed it! The portions are pretty big so I recommend sharing; it is caring or save it for another go around"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional everything you order will be great. I have been there a few times already and can't wait to go back. Such depth in the menu from their amazing omelets to bacon filled pancakes. I loved the service and our waiter Andrew was excellent. I will honestly consider this place every time I go to breakfast and will compare every other place to this one bec it sets the standard."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food and service. You can customize basically anything here and add on extras. I got the twice baked scramble and added mushrooms. The extra mushrooms were amazing and they gave me ALOT for a buck extra. I'm very impressed with the food. Fresh fruit. Delicious toast (I don't get why other Yelpers are hating). I can find zero things wrong with the food.   Portions are big. Everything I ordered was correct and delicious. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented.   Two recommendations: they need a more simple easy to read menu. I'm sure if u are used to it it is fine, but it is scattered and hard to understand. Second, they have some funk (good kind) on the walls such as license plates and art style graffiti but it still looks plane with just sharpie and yellow background. Add some.... Idk stuff lol . Overall great experience. Great variety. Great staff. And awesome food (most important)"}
{"text":"Good food with large portions, kids ordered pancakes and we ordered nachos and an omelet. The only reason I knocked off a star were the prices, tho the food and service was good it was a little expensive for what we got.   They do offer a military discount for out brothers and sisters in arms."}
{"text":"The place is clean with good service, large food portions and the menu has a lot of selection. Unfortunately, the food was bland and prices were high. They do send coupons out and they seem to have a point system to save money if you sign up for their club, but I'm more interested in food taste."}
{"text":"Happy that Squeeze In is in Las Vegas. Best breakfast in Vegas. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great food, people and place! Be prepared to be in food coma after eating the food, and sign up for their newsletter for great deals!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I can't think of a place I love to eat more than the Squeeze In. Great for ALL ages, even the pickiest of eaters can find something here.   First, I love the ambience here. Writing on the walls, stuff hanging from the ceiling, aliens, vinyl records, my favorite music (classic rock and music from the 70's).  Second, the friendly and genuine staff. The wait staff is so knowledgeable about the extensively long menu and their recommendations have always been on point.   Third, their menu which hit home as the hot chocolate features my sister's name (not a common name). During our last visit, our waitress recommended pineapple, mango with a splash of pomegranate for our mimosas. Glad we took her suggestion, knowing the staff has never let us down. A friend and I shared the Jack Johnson banana pancakes (short stack), two really large pancakes with melted butter, pecans, and, of course, bananas. The crunchy pecans gave the pancakes a wonderful texture. Impressive. For my main meal, I had the Huevos Montana and, again, took the recommendations which included cheese and onions on my potatoes. The food is so pretty, you almost don't wanna eat it. I definitely ate it. The recommendations to the plethora of choices makes this dining establishment even more fun and creative.   More kudos to Squeeze In for using compostable to-go boxes. That's a huge plus for me. Squeeze In deserves 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place.  Come Hungry!!!   Omelets are four eggs.  Huge portions.   Very casual place"}
{"text":"If you have kids come here. ???The food is beyond excellent.  Huge portions with a funny menu.  Green alien theme well yes!!!"}
{"text":"See my picture.  My shi super food scramble with pesto and turkey sausage (which is the option on the menu listed with the shi for $1.99 extra) was a ridiculous disaster.  Instead of turkey sausage, which is a breakfast food, they put sliced turkey deli meat, which is not a breakfast food, on my shi scramble.  What???  What were they thinking?  This is what I opened up at home after my husband waited 40 minutes to pick up or to go order. When he arrived at squeezed in, the to go order took so long, even though I called it in 15 minutes before my husband arrived at the restaurant, because he was waiting behind another customer whose order was also messed up. I think this could be a good place if they train their employees on the menu, the register, and customer service."}
{"text":"The service was great!  I like when there are several people waiting on you instead of an assigned person.  Teamwork makes the dream work!  I had the bacon, eggs, and biscuits and gravy.  My better half had the Lake Taco, and both were good.  Again, service was awesome.  I can't remember the name of the person assigned to us because all of the waiters were awesome!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm... Great breakfast, brunch, or lunch spot for any day of the week!   This is surprisingly a franchise. But you sure wouldn't know it. It feels very mom-n-pop with the kitschy, eclectic decor. You'll find baskets of toys to take to the table to help entertain your kids, writings on the walls, wooden aliens, Wizard of OZ paraphernalia, a bike hanging from the ceiling, mismatched tables and chairs, etc. your eyes will not get bored here.   The menu is like a book that is organized by food type and chalk full of colorful pictures! There are even vegetarian, gluten free, vegan, and low calorie options to choose from. But be warned, the portion sizes are ginormous!"}
{"text":"Was told to seat ourselves...which we did. Waited 15min & no one made a nod nor approach us so we left. The restaurant was about help full.  A simple I'll be right with you goes a long way"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with our trip to Squeeze in. My fiancé and I shared \"The Maggie\" and the \"Big Bad Johnson\". I watched our food sit up in the window for a while before anyone grabbed it to bring it over. Inevitably, the stuffed French toast (the Maggie) was terribly cold and it ruined the overall taste of the dish. The fruit on the french toast plate looked bad, the strawberries over-ripe and the bananas under-ripe. The \"Big Bad Johnson\" was missing sausage, there was absolutely no sausage at all in the omelette which again, ruined the overall taste of the dish. The sourdough toast was served soggy and not toasted at all and the spuds were the only item worth eating out of everything we ordered. My glass of grapefruit juice with ice smelled and like musty tap water and we were very disappointed. Though it was 11am I did not expect the quality of our breakfast to be so sub-par. Would rather go somewhere where the food is always hot and served correctly like Egg Works!"}
{"text":"I must say that this is my husband and I's favorite breakfast place ever!! The service is always excellent! It's so nice to see a bunch of happy smiling faces when we walk in. We especially love Andrew! He is so attentive and just a genuinely nice person! If you want amazing wholesome food in an environment where you feel at home Squeeze In is the place to be!! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Sadly I was very disappointed with my experience. I was so pumped about trying a new a place that had raving reviews. Well, the service sucked, we waited a very long time for the food, and the food sucked."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for lunch, using our Groupon voucher. It was ok. The staff was nice, but the food was not as flavorful as we had hoped.The garlic parmesasn fries the best i had..... Overall, it was a pleasant but not a memorable meal. A bit pricey...... Love the decor  beautiful very Lay back"}
{"text":"The menu has a great variety. The restaurant itself it small but that's the idea, since it happens to be part of the origin of the restaurant. The portions are huge!!!!!! The side biscuits and gravy was a full size portion. I could have shared my meal with my husband. My husband got a burrito and it looked awesome! I think I'll get that next time I come I'll order something that's unique to the restaurant. The regular breakfast is just like breakfast at any other breakfast place. Stick with the items that are unique to this menu and you'll really enjoy yourself. The atmosphere is interesting to say the least. The food is also very reasonably priced! So major points for good quality at a good price."}
{"text":"Service is awful... we waited over an hour for our food. Wait staff is clueless, expediter had no idea what he was doing.  Food is halfway decent but not worth the wait, too many other options in this area of town, suggest taking your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant Is new to Vegas and has been having a soft opening the last couple weeks. The food is phenomenal from dishes like chocolate covered bacon and bacon pancakes to a crab cake Benedict. The menu is full of flavor and I have had not tasted anything that was not delicious. The service has been phenomenal and both times I have gone Andrew has been our server and taken great care of us. This place also lets you donate object to be hung on the wall as well as color, draw, or sign your name on the wall. All and all it is a great breakfast or lunch experience for the whole family"}
{"text":"This place has a fun, laidback vibe. I had never loved pancakes but once I tried the banana walnut pancakes from Squeeze In I can't get enough!.. the syrup is not overly sweet and slightly salty. And just soo delicious! They have unfortunately created a new craving for me!.. I also tried the club sandwich.. it was ok but a little dry for my taste. I will definitely be coming here time and time again!"}
{"text":"This place has tons of food choices, which made it hard to make the decision right away. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I was even offered a sweater since we decided to seat outside (not planning ahead for the cooler Vegas temp). The food came out quick and the portions were huge! I ordered the stuffed French Toast with the side of bacon, and it was delicious! Love this place a lot. It's worth going back to!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Jersey and my cousin suggested this spot bc she heard good reviews about it. I'm so glad we chose this place. Food was delicious and the service was great! I had ordered the special - Steak Benny (I believe that's what it was called) with a side of French toast. Soooo good! Added some Cholula sauce to the Benny and potatoes and it was delish! My cousin enjoyed her pancakes as well. Our server, Talia, was very nice and informative about the menu. She suggested I order the Steak Benny, and I'm glad I went with it. Potatoes were so good, too! I also ordered a mimosa bc there was a 50% off deal on Yelp for an alcoholic beverage. Definitely worth it! I go the mimosa in a huge cup! I would definitely come back to this place for breakfast/brunch!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I never even knew this place existed. But I'm glad I got to try it out! Yelp check-in's get you 50% off alcohol, so why not? Peach Bellini - pretty good taste but definitely strong for me.  I got the french toast with strawberries and my friend got a tortilla wrapped turkey with vegetables thing and a side of potatoes. It was just alright. Nothing stood out like o-m-g amazing, but it is your average type of breakfast.   Service was great though! I'll definitely be back in the future to try out new things now that I've discovered this cute little shop."}
{"text":"First time here! Food and service out of this world! Vegan and Vegetarian options abound"}
{"text":"The omelets are amazing (but go hungry - portion size is no joke here)!  No other words needed."}
{"text":"A cute little hip trendy place definitely not a place to go and relax though we weren't even done with our food and the waitress was pushing us out the door.  But! The waitress was pretty nice and the food was ok.   It was pretty pricey for what you got.  Just an average experience worth checking out though."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend. Great food with large portions. Awesome Blood Marys. Make sure you sign up with their reward/mailing list for b-day coupons."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, first two times the food was SO good. Last time, the burrito I got was SO BLAND no flavor whatsoever I tried everything to add some flavor to it.   They do have an awesome atmosphere, great service and even toys for the little ones to play with!"}
{"text":"I thought i'd done this a while ago, but i guess not. I have to remove a star from this place because while it's good they are very inconsistent.  Both with the food and the service. When it's good it's great but we have slowed down our visits significantly because of the risk involved with getting our day off to a bad start."}
