{"text":"I'm a fan of food trucks.  I keep track of which ones are in my work neighbourhood so that I can pop down for lunch, and I definitely have my favourites.  Stuft is not one of them. 

They were parked outside Global Village Backpackers at Spadina and King, and I stopped in for lunch.  You could tell they weren't that busy that day (or possibly weren't that popular), but I was more excited that I didn't have to wait in a line.  I ordered the lamb and feta sausage.  What a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting that much!  The sausage was luke warm at best.  You could tell it was cooked in advance in hopes of a big turn out and basically just sat there.  The sauce was nice and flavourful, but I couldn't get past the temperature.  I ended up paying $10 for a cold sausage with only 1 type of sauce.  Over priced and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique and tastiest meals I've had from a food truck in Toronto so far. You wouldn't think hot dogs could be unique, but when you get a Creole Turducken sausage with chimmichurri sauce \"unique\" definitely comes to mind.

They use a fresh rolll, cut off one end and then shove it over a medieval-looking spike so there's room for the giant sausage. But first they fill the whole partway with whatever sauce you choose (they have recommendations if the choice is too overwhelming)

My wife had the pork fennel pineapple sausage, not sure which sauce. We also shared the homestyle chips. Everything was delicious.

I feel like it was a little pricey (as I've found with almost all food trucks in Toronto - is it because they have to pay a private lot to park?), which is why I've dropped them to 4 stars but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

Viva La Food Truck Revolution!"}
{"text":"When I heard there was a food truck serving turducken down the street, I planned my day around it. I didn't realize it was in sausage form, which let me down (not their fault) but I still went for it. The sausage was served in a cool bun that just looked like a little loaf of bread with a sausage sized hole in it. I've never seen anything like that. It came with a chipotle BBQ sauce, which scared me at first since it looked something like a ketchup, which would have meant tossing the thing in the trash, but a good sniff alleviated my fears. 

This sausage is probably among the top 15 things I've put in my mouth. The aftertaste, probably from the sauce, is still dancing around my mouth. It had an amazing blend of spices, but I'm having trouble discerning exactly what was in there. 

This was such a great sausage. I highly recommend checking it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"You are what you eat.  I ate sausage. So I'm a pig.  Actually I really am because after going to one food truck in Celebration Square, I went to the one next to it.  It was $9 for the sausage.  I liked the crispiness of the bun (i'm one of those people who when they have a hot dog, that the bun must be put on the grill, so it's crispy and toasty!), however the sausage was very average.  For a place that specializes in sausages, I would expect a bit more flavour and their \"gourmet sauce\" tasted like standard burrito sauce.  The sausage tasted like I could have bought those pre-cooked sausages from a grocery store and just heated it up.  

The only redeeming thing about this food truck was that they had Boylan soda and I've been craving that for a couple of weeks now.  :-)"}

My third night, round two of the TIFF food trucks.

This is probably the best meal I've had from the food trucks so far. Great bang for your buck here. 4.5 stars (1/2 star loss because some menu items weren't available)

First off, this idea reminds me of Pocket Dawg at the Saddledome in Calgary (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pocket-dawg-no-title#hrid:-EcH5GwSsv4XLb-sst0V4w). Similar idea but Stuft is WAAAAAY better.

There's a varied choice of gourmet sausages to choose from. I went with the Creole Turducken ($9), a turkey, duck, and chicken blend of meats with creole spices. For my choice of sauce I took the employee's suggestion and paired my meat with the sweet chipotle BBQ sauce. On the side I grabbed a cup of their Apple Fennel Slaw (4$). The sausage was rammed inside a nicely toasted and warmed baguette with the BBQ sauce oozing out of the top. The spice blend was fantastic. It was strong and in your face just the way you would expect from a Creole inspired dish. While I liked the flavour of the BBQ sauce I would have preferred a smokier flavour when pairing it with the Creole spices. Maybe their Wasabi Honey Dijon Mustard would have been a better fit. The Apple Fennel Slaw was decent. The apple came through nicely, but the fennel was nowhere to be found until my last bite. But when I did take that last bite I really understood what they were trying to get at with this combination.

Overall a great job. I'll be back to get Stuft again."}
