{"text":"The food is great -flavor and taste are excellent.  These should be your expectations.  Otherwise, pretend you're going to a cantina in Mexico: not much service, kind of slow,  the seats aren't  all matched and the flowers aren' t bought daily.   And the price fits, so go enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"The food at El Tango is excellent; many flavors and the owner prepares them with many different ingredients. No complaints there.

However, the service and policies are some of the worst in the city. They had a teenage girl working there on Friday night who clearly had no clue what she was doing. You have to come in, wait in line (took 20 minutes JUST TO ORDER) with only three couples in front of us. After you order you can choose to sit at one of the five tables. If there are a couple of people already sitting in there, and the people who order in front of you then sit down to eat, there will be no tables open to sit at!!!

After waiting forever to order, we finally sit down at a dirty table. The person who we ordered with came out with half of our food (forgot my beer and my girlfriends salad) and finally cleaned up the table. I asked, \"is this busy for you tonight?\" and she said, \"nah this aint nothing\" clueless to my motive regarding the slow service time. 

Oh yeah, bring your own water; it costs $2.50 a bottle for some Nestle garbabe bottled water. Beers are like $4.50. Yikes.

Here's a novel idea; hire a server; a compotent one. 

Also, heard a lot about unsanitary conditions; the kitchen actually looks neat and clean but it wouldn't suprsise me if they kept certain things around longer then they should. I guess we got lucky. 

The food is a 5 but the service is a 0. I'll give it three stars total. I'd suggest calling your order in and taking it to go."}
{"text":"Better than any Mexican restaurant in town. Great food that taste authentic, must try the chicken  quesadilla.  Small seating area, but great atmosphere with friends and family, and the decoration are out of this world."}
{"text":"I visited this Restaurant on May 29 based on a recommendation of a friend. When I arrived at around 2 pm the place was locked up with a note on the door which read, \"Be right back\". I waited for about 10 minutes and a man with a cowboy hat showed up and asked me if I was there to eat. I'm guessing he was hoping I was looking for a job since there was a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window and he was working by himself. From previous reviews I had read my initial thought was that he treated his employees as bad as his customers. I later found out he was the owner.

When I entered the restaurant I found a table and sat down like I have at most of the other Mexican Restaurants I've been too. Then he told me I needed to order at the counter. I went to the counter and saw black boards with some items priced around $14 and up, then the owner finally told ma about some paper menu's and handed me one. I tried to order what I normally order in a Mexican Restaurant and which is a meal and a drink. I had come by myself around 2 pm expecting there to be lunch prices and I was sadly mistaken.  My total bill including tax came to $23.92 for a lower priced meal, chips, and salsa (not free), and Iced Tea. This price did not include a tip.

When I sat down at a table among the \"mismatched furniture and Latin-American knick-knacks, fake flowers, and fountains\" as another reviewer called them, I was still irritated by the price I paid since I'm on a budget. The first thing I was brought was some very hot and tasty chips with 3 different sauces. I think the chips were made to order because they tasted so fresh. I asked the owner if these sauces were spicy and was told, \"uh, it's Mexican, what do you expect?\" So I figured I was going to have to figure this out on my own. I tasted the sauces and they were delicious but not overly spicy. I may return someday for these alone. I had to return to the counter to ask for my tea which when he finally brought it to my table, it tasted a little sour like it was on the verge turning bad. My meal was brought to the table and it was piping hot with beans, rice, and shredded beef enchiladas. These also were very delicious and included a few what I'm guessing were home-maid toppings. The meal was a very generous portion and more than I could eat so the owner wrapped it up for me to go. He even brought me a refill on the iced tea during the meal.

When I was leaving I did have a nice conversation with the owner about how good the food was. Alright you're probably asking by this point if the food was so good why did I only rate it 3 stars. Well I rated it 3 stars because of the atmosphere and price of my meal. I've had meals that were just as good at other Mexican Restaurants at half the price and the chips were free! Would I return and would I recommend this restaurant to anyone else? I might would return and get every thing to go because of the atmosphere. The food is way overpriced but it is delicious."}
{"text":"I had the WORST dining experience of my life here.  
1) There are cobwebs and dust at the counter where you place your order.
2) The glass that my overpriced margarita came in was chipped at the lip.
3) The tables were all dirty and sticky. 
4) We waited a ridiculously long time for the food to come out.
5) When my burrito finally did come out, it had beef in it - I'd ordered fish.
6) Upon taking the burrito back up to the counter, I was told that I'd ordered wrong and that I would have to wait another 15 minutes for my food.  
I told the guy in the crumpled cowboy hat that I had not ordered wrong, he had made the wrong food and that instead of waiting, I'd prefer a refund.  
Anyone with any business sense or common decency would have said something like, \"Sorry, we goofed, we'll make it better.\"  He, instead told me that he doesn't give refunds, that actually, my burrito was there, behind the counter, but lacking the avocado I'd asked for and he still did not take responsibility for his mistake.  
I will never go to this terrible restaurant again and I will tell everyone I meet never to go.  Everything was too expensive, we spent $56 and ended up walking out, after only drinking half of our drinks and eating one tiny $10 appetizer.   Do yourself a favor - don't waste your time here.  Other reviews say the food is good.  Maybe so, but there are other good Mexican restaurants and this place is not worthy of your patronage."}
{"text":"I love burritos.  I love Latin/Mexican food in general.

Enter El Tango.  We walked in last night, not knowing what to expect.  It was kind of strange to order at the counter, but not terribly off-putting.  Like I said, my dining partner and I did not know what to expect, so we ordered:  Chips and salsa (which comes with 3 kinds), Quesadilla Hongos Al Ajillo, and a California Avocado Lime Burrito with veggies, all to share.  Perhaps the girl who took our order could have warned us?  Maybe she just thought we were hogs?  Whatever, she was nice enough and I don't suppose it's her job to talk people out of ordering more food...

Holy crap.  We were definitely not prepared for the amount of food that was about to be presented to us.  The order of chips and salsa could have fed like 8 people, but the pineapple tomatillo salsa and the smoked cinnamon chipotle were super inventive and delicious.  The pico was just meh, but with the other two we didn't even care.  Next, let's talk about the quesadilla.  YUM.  Normally I could care less about quesadillas, but this one was super garlicky (read:  spicy), and whatever sweet drizzle was on it was delicious.  It was definitely not something you could get at Taco Bell or Chipotle (ugh).  The Burrito was HUGE.  I mean, it probably weighed as much as my cat (which by the way, is kinda hefty).  But it was awesome.  Limey, as promised, with tons of real veggies including sweet potatoes and cabbage.  It is definitely not a traditional burrito, but I am more than ok with that.  One of the dishes came with this amazing cabbage, salsa kind of salad that was sort of sweet and spicy and made a great accompaniment to the quesadilla.  

Now, let's talk about how much food we actually ate.  We finished off the pineapple salsa, each ate one piece of the quesadilla (there were 4), and not even half of our half of the burrito.  There were also enough chips left to last a normal person for at least a week.  We did, however, finish the cabbage salsa salad (which is clearly not what it's actually called).  Whoa.

I am definitely looking forward to finishing it off today, or at least trying to!

Oh, and I will be back to try the cactus pear margarita."}
{"text":"It's a fun little place and it's not what you're expecting but if you like good food, you'll like it. It's not your typical \"mexican\" restaurant because the food is more unique and fresh. When I first went in, I was confused because you order at a register. Then I was confused because they only have canned/bottled drinks. That was sort of bizarre but I got over it fast once we took a seat because the atmosphere is fun and the food was really good.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went back again. Even more moths, even more delicious food. It's like a mind f***!!!! So delicious but so nerve wrecking!!!!!"}
{"text":"I placed a take-out order via phone 2 hours ago, just arrived to pick it up and was told it would be another 15 minutes. This is after I was already here an hour ago(the time I was told it would be ready). Do I get a sincere apology? No, just a \"that's the way it is!\" I guess since I'm still here waiting speaks something about the food, but this guy seriously needs to hire more help and learn some customer service skills."}
{"text":"El Tango was the latest stop on a local Taco Tour some twitter friends and I have been doing.  10-12 of us all sat down and pretty much ordered at the same time.  We did stain the kitchen a little bit with that many people even though we called ahead.  But that really is my only complaint.  The two guys running the place were extremely friendly and as quick as they could be while taking orders, cooking & serving.  

With almost a dozen people we realized afterwards that no two people got the same meal and everyone was happy with the food.  I had a fish taco & Mole chicken wings.  I would certainly eat either one again.  We also tried the chip/dip sampler which had 3 salsa's including a regular, pineapple/tomatillo & chipotle/cinnamon.  they were tasty.  

I'm looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest restaurant I have ever patronized. It is the tastiest Mexican food I've ever found, but on a Wednesday night a quoted takeout time of 25 minutes actually equates to 90 minutes. On a Friday or Saturday night, plan on 2.5+ hours..."}
{"text":"This place rules and is so incredibly hard to enjoy at the same time. You have to play by his rules... Very \"soup nazi\"esque. If you are down to follow a few weird rules and enjoy some of the best and most unique food in Cleveland, then this is your spot. Really though, I understand that some people can't deal with a long wait or the attitude of a really unique chef who seems to be only it for.... wait...what's he in it for? It's not even clear that he likes having the restaurant. However, this is the zone. All the dishes are made with so much love and care, that it becomes apparent that this guy is incredible at preparing food. All the food is amazing and very fresh. If he was nicer, this place would be too busy. Enjoy your PBR tacos and greasebomb burritos elsewhere, I'm happy with this weirdo's food all to myself."}
{"text":"El Tango is like no other Mexican/Latin restaurant i've ever been to. If you are looking for the typical mexican experience (endless chips and salsa, table service, various dishes with piles of refried beans, rice, lettuce tomato and sour cream) Then this is NOT the place for you.

Lets start with the downside: Soda in cans, water in bottles, and pretty much a complete lack of service outside of what you could expect at your local fast food restaurant. Your order is placed at the register contained within the open kitchen and you can expect a reasonable wait for your food because everything is freshly prepared. But lets be honest, you arent going to go to El Tango for a dazzling display of decor and waiters in black ties, you are going to go there because you want to eat great food.

If you want the best Mexican/Latin food you have ever tasted, in gigantic portions then this is a cant miss experience. A simple order of chips and salsa gets you an enormous pile of freshly fried tortilla chips with freshly made Pico de Gallo, Chipotle Cinnamon, and Tomatillo Pineapple salsas. Large burritos, quesidillas, and other dishes served with generous portions of marinated meats including beef, chicken, red snapper, and even vegetarian options. My personal favorite is the California Lime and Avocado burrito with delicious meaty and creamy innards, wrapped in a freshly grilled tortilla shell which has been rubbed down with salt, sugar, and spices to make for a taste that you would consider trading an organ for.

Last but certainly not least are the drinks and desserts, considering you even have room left for any of them (id suggest doing food and desert on separate days). They have margaritas made with mango, fresh squeezed lime, cactus-pear, even Jalapeno infused flavors.They also have a fantastic Vanilla Lemonade that will take you to another place. All these are freshly made and unbelievably delicious. For dessert, Pumpkin Chipotle pie a sweet dessert with a bit of a kick.

In all, ive tasted flavors here that i have not had anywhere else. All of the ingredients, the homemade sauces, drinks, and desserts leave you begging for more even though the portions will fill you up fast. 

The one big downside is that this restaurant seems to keep irregular hours. I've come by on weekday evenings and weekends to find the lights out and the door locked even though the hours sign indicates it should be open.

The owner in his white cowboy hat, certainly is not a crafty businessman nor does he have a big fancy restaurant with incredible service. You'll pay more for your food here than going for a burrito at your local Chipotle. But with food this good, its an easy 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5 ."}
{"text":"does anyone out there know what happened to this place?  i believe it changed hands recently and sadly, i can really tell.  previously owned and operated by a very lively and creative chef that took the place to great heights in its lakewood neighborhood, now he is nowhere in sight.. seems to have left his cowboy hat behind and someone else is wearing it.  
watch the cleanliness of this place and if you are hoping for that certain touch that the food had previously, you may have to remind them."}
{"text":"This place is great. Enjoy your time here. Sip on a margarita, wait for your food and enjoy one of the best tacos in he Cleveland area. All made to order. Great job! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Find somewhere else; The food isn't half as good as it used to be, and the service somehow is even worse than before.
 Luchita's, Momocho...both have a higher level of Latin food for the same prices - with better service. Hell, Taco Bell treats their customers better, and is far more sanitary to boot."}
{"text":"We passed the place and thought it looked cool from the outside, so we decided to grab a snack! I got one fish taco which was really good. Went well with the corona beer as well. The guy working there (in some review described as the a-hole with the hat) was super nice. You place your order at the desk and then pick it up. Actually-in our case he brought everything to the table and cleaned everything up after us. For desert I had some kind of lime cake..forgot the actual name;...best cake I've ever eaten! Tastes like cheesecake, lime and cream at the same time... I was stuffed after all that! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some serious sanitary issues. I walked in and saw the amount of flies, bugs, and nats and left right away. Over the years I have heard good things about this place, but cleanliness is big in my book. I don't care how \"Cool\" this Antonio guy is, I'm not getting sick. 

Two Stars for Sanitation"}
{"text":"Great meal last night. Calamari bacon tacos, Santa Fe tamale pie and enchiladas were all killer. Excellent flavors, really fresh ingredients makes it worth the cross-town trek."}
{"text":"What in the Sam heck did I walk into here?? My husband and I had a hankering for something a little different, and he had been to El Tango years ago and suggested it, so we decided to give it a go. We walked in and the man in the cowboy hat that everyone speaks of is just casually mopping the floor, no hello, nothing. No one else is in there. Okay...fine. So we ask if we should just sit anywhere and he looked at us like we each had 17 heads and said, \"We don't have a wait staff.\" That's it. So, I guess we'll just awkwardly wander to the counter...we pick up a couple of the menus (which are simply printed on paper) and pick out what we want. I order two tacos and tell Mr. Cowboy Hat I'd like sour cream on them. He looks me dead in the eye and says, \"You don't want sour cream. You don't need it on these.\" I wanted to scream, \"I think I know what I want!\" But, I digress. My husband went to order something off the \"entrees\" section and Mr. Cowboy Hat goes, \"We don't do the dinners anymore. They don't make any money.\" Okay, BYE THEN. 
Literally, we just left.
The menus are PAPER. Go spend a couple bucks at Kinko's and reprint them if HALF THE MENU is unavailable. Holy moly. I don't know how this place is still in business!"}
{"text":"I still have dreams about this place. I've yet to find a replacement in Seattle - in flavor, price and portion.  The vegetarian burrito has sweet potatoes and occasionally green apples in it - to bring out the flavor of the refried beans. The standard side salad was the perfect compliment. I would sell my soul for this burrito. They also have an amazing chipotle pumpkin pie (spicy!)."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this 4 and a half, it was so good. Pan-Latin & Mexican food that is fresh, original, and really demonstrates the effort that is put into it. Small place inside and you order at the counter, but they let us know they will have outdoor seating in the next few weeks and finally get their beer license!

My mom and I had chips and salsa (salsas if we're being correct) and the pineapple-tomatillo was by far my fave. Totally refreshing. The pico and the smoky cinnamon chipotle were also very good. We split the avocado lime burrito w/chicken and it was HUGE. i still have a half of my half left to eat. Great flavors, good ingredients. 

We also had the vanilla lime-lemonade which we were informed would 'change our lives' - I hope it did, my life needs some changing. 

I can't imagine what its like during a rush as it was only one solo dude working there, but for a mid-afternoon it was excellent. The kitschy decor in the restaurant doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"I met Antonio at a bar which was very new at the time. It's in a place where many other businesses have failed, and he wished them the best. He told tall tales of cooking in San Francisco, allegedly having single handedly made amazing food for the 50th anniversary of the golden gate bridge. We talked about Mexican joints and the restaurant business. And politics. And religion. And booze. I thought he was a cool guy that probably ran cool restaurant.

He does in fact make excellent food. Almost certainly the best burritos I've ever tasted. However, he's a much better cook than restaurant manager.

He won't give you a glass of water, you have to buy bottled. His staff us constantly turning over because he's a tyrant. He may be slow, he may be rude, but damn those burritos rule. Good luck."}
{"text":"Might be the best food in town, but not worth the hassle of waiting forever to even get someone to take your order. It was a Tuesday night and we walked out without our food."}
{"text":"Ah, I enjoy you El Tango.  I remember you in the early years of your Lakewood digs.  I wasn't sure you were going to make it, though the food said you should; there just never seemed to be a particularly large crowd gathered for you.   Alas you have survived, thrived even.  I have since moved, but have not moved on, and look forward to the day we meet again."}
{"text":"Went to El Tango Taqueria for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  I was the only one in the restaurant,  i am guessing because the weather was so horrible outside (high winds and raining)  

I was greeted by the owner of the place who was personable and sported a white cowboy hat.

I ordered a beef burritos.  I was told this was an \"LA Style\"  burrito.  It was very good  ...beats the heck out of a Chipotle beef burrito.  It was made with a lot of different spices which gave it a unique flavor that is probobly pretty hard to find anywhere else in Cleveland.

It was a healthy portion that I could only eat half,  I wrapped up the other half and took it home for dinner.  

The only drawback was I ordered a diet coke that was given to me in a can.  I wish that it was a fountain drink because by the end of the meal I was thirsty and didn't feel like paying for another can.

All things considered, the environment was definitely unique, the food was very good and I would definetely go there again."}
{"text":"I am puzzled and intrigued by this Mexican restaurant. The kitchen area takes up at least half of the space, which is cool but also strange. You order at the counter, then find a seat among mismatched furniture and Latin-American knick-knacks, fake flowers, and fountains. You wait ... and wait ... and wait. And then you're brought your food, and it is good. REALLY good.

Quite a few negatives with this place. I'll get those out of the way first.

1. The aforementioned long wait, for .. what? A burrito. Well, two burritos. The guy with the cowboy hat apologized and said that they'd run out of rice. Huh? At a restaurant where rice is pretty much the common factor among all dishes? And at 6 pm on a Saturday, when you know you're going to have a high volume of customers? (Yet, another reason the wait threw us for such a loop was because we were one of only three parties in there, and one had already gotten their food by the time we'd ordered.)

2. The flies. Ugh. I hate bugs in general, and am actually afraid of them. I won't eat anything a fly has already landed on. So there were times that I was actually darting flies at the table and moving my plate around so that they wouldn't decide to pop a squat on my burrito.

3. Although the listing claims the restaurant is good for kids (and it very well may be, for older kids) there are no high chairs. So we had to hold a squirmy baby and attempt to feed her from that position. Kind of annoying and probably the major reason we won't be returning.

4. Bottled water only (not free). But actually, thinking of the overall skeeviness factor of the place, I'd probably better count that as a positive because I'm not sure I'd want to drink their tap water.

Now, onto the positives:

1. VERY GOOD FOOD! The burrito was ginormous and oh so tasty. I got the avocado-lime burrito with chicken. Everything tasted amazing. My only qualm? It was very, very wet. It came in just a tin foil wrapper plopped on a plate -- which is fine -- but we weren't given silverware and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to pick this monster up and put it into my mouth. Not to mention that it had something on the outside -- it almost seemed like some kind of liquid and then sprinkled with sugar, oddly enough -- so that it was completely impractical to try to use my hands for this. But it tasted great.

2. There were two young women who helped us -- one taking the order and another who stepped in after we'd been there for a bit who got us silverware and wrapped our leftovers. They were very kind and seemed like fun people. 

So, will I try El Tango again? Not to dine in again, probably ever. It just wasn't really worth it, in my opinion, because it wasn't an enjoyable atmosphere and wasn't appropriate for the baby. And it's not the type of place I'd want to waste on a date night, because it's not special enough. But the food was great, so I will definitely consider takeout in the future.

Although I really have to stop thinking about those flies."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've EVER had. 
Had chorizo, chicken and apple tacos, so many flavors and textures. Came with 3 different salsas. Everything was super fresh and delish."}
{"text":"2nd time we have come here. Never busy, at night during the week when we go. The owner, in the cowboy hat does it all! We always start with the margaritas, mango & cactus. Drink 2 glasses and you will be feeling great! Haha. Food is always fresh and very tasty! I had the chicken Quesadilla which is the best I've ever had at any Mexican/Latin restaurant! Before we leave we always stay a few minutes longer chatting with the owner. He is looking for good, reliable help if anyone is interested."}
{"text":"I grew up eating burritos in California, these are LEGIT mission style burritos.  Chipotle may taste good but it's still fast food.  Yeah the service isn't the fastest, but well worth the time.  The flavor and attention to ingredients totally makes it a 5.  I will absolutely return and bring others."}
{"text":"Vanilla Lemonade: I don't like Mexican food, but I like lemonade, and I LOVE the vanilla lemonade at this place. Apparently the food is good as well, but I didn't have any of it; I just went for the lemonade and that alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  Colorful, fresh, fun, and dare I say, \"creativity on a plate\" Latin/Mexican fusion food.  There is no other place like this in Cleveland.  Antonio (the owner) greeted me at the counter wearing a cowboy hat.  He proceeded to multitask by talking to me while cooking my lunch.  He has such charm about it him, and we got to talking about his other restaurants and the places we have lived that we have in common.  I originally wanted the Yucatan Conchinita Pibil (Mayan barbecued pork) but decided against its dinner-size portion because it was only 11am.  I opted for the grilled red snapper taco.  It was love at first bite...the perfectly layered flavors, grilled fish, triple wrapping of corn tortillas and chipotle cream was simply delicious.  I cannot wait to go back and explore the other items on the menu.  

**Update** went back during the week and some jackass kid was working there.  Totally rude and full of attitude.  And there was a FRIGGIN' HAIR in my salad to boot.  Don't go in this place if Antonio (the owner who wears a cowboy hat) isn't working."}
{"text":"El Tango is my favorite Mexican restaurant and Best.Margaritas.Ever. Is def a must try everything on the menu even brunch on Sunday's and would give five star but no consistency on business hours so call before arrival to make they are open.!!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience is attempting to dine here. I walked in and before I could so much utter a request for a table for two I got barked at, \"I'll be with you in like and hour!\" He did an about face and I was left there standing wondering what I did so much to piss him off when I never said a word to him. I understand they have a small kitchen but I couldn't 4 open tables. I was so shocked I will never go back. I will also tell every one what a nasty man runs the joint."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, he is an a-hole because he threatened me with violence to the point a police report was filed against him. Dont know the guy, just walked by his restaurant at the wrong time...probably caught him 2 bottles of cheap wine into his evening."}
{"text":"This place was one heck of a find. Definitely has the hole in the wall feel as I'd say this place could fit 20-30 people max. The food was really good but pricey. The chips and salsa don't come standard and are a side but are totally worth it. These were the freshest chips I've had and they came with three awesome salsas. The water here is not free as it only comes in bottles which was kind of a bummer. Other than that, the chef brought out food right to the table. The guy was nice and talked a little bit to us. The food had fresh ingredients and after seeing/tasting it, it made sense why it was a little more pricey than the average Mexican restaurant. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Above average cuisine.  Great atmosphere and services.  Enjoyed the Camarones!  Pricy but good!"}
{"text":"El Tango offer some fantastic pan-Latin American cuisine.  The portions are generous, most entrees could provide two meals, but they are more pricey than your average Mexican joint.  Think Luchita's vs. Nuevo Acapulco.

They DO accept credit cards for payment.  They are in a perpetual process of getting a liquor license (for the past 3 years)  but the BYOB policy can make for a fun (and cost effective) experience as we have previously brought our own tequila and margarita mix.  No corking fees.

The flavor is fantastic!  Most everything I've tried has a taste that pops.   They also offer something for every taste (avocado lime beef burrito, cochinita pibil pork, chicken, vegetarian, etc).  The fish tacos are one of the least expensive items on the menu but never disappoint.  

Service can be slow because they staff only a couple people at a time.  
Open until 10pm weeknights, takeout order are usually ready in 25 minutes.

Definitely worth trying before any other cookie-cutter Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Not your average dining experience. Ordering at the counter was slightly awkward because we had never been there before but the food was so good it didn't matter. Just go with the flow and enjoy. We had the guacamole, salsas, lime margaritas, baked burrito and huevos rancheros. Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic medley of flavors.   Excellent warm ambiance, the margaritas are truly excellent and so was the food.   Reasonably priced for excellent food fares.  

In Lakewood and looking for a new Mexican restaurant? 

Check out Tango Grill,  go meet the owner and cook Antonio and have a margarita.    

Quesadillas were also some of the best I have ever tasted.  

Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food.  For whatever reason the chips are to die for.  I've eaten there twice and thoroughly enjoyed my meal, HOWEVER my stomach did not.  The first time I ate there I felt a little ill but figured it was my sensitive stomach.  The last time I ate there I was vomiting the rest of the night and into the next day.  Even though the food was so yummy, I can't bear to go back there.  Cleanliness is definitely an issue.  If you're willing to risk a vomit party later that night, then go for it.  The food really is good, why else would i give a place that makes me vomit 2 stars?"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Mexican I have had since being in cleveland  It's a new twist on old favorites and if you are in Lakewood, make sure you check this gem out"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the owner is a complete jerk! I've been going there since it opened & every time I try to call in an order for pick up he acts like its some sort of imposition. He then gives me an outrageous wait time! No less than an hour every time... He'll say he's swamped. But 9 times outa 10 when I show up the place is dead. He once told me another 30 minutes after I showed up after the hour. I've never written a review before but just don't think he deserves a high rating if he treats his customers like this..."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. Tango is lacking -- has some run-down Mexican character to it, but lacks the following: appropriate amount of lighting, appropriate amount of tables, appropriate amount of kitchen space.  Their kitchen and tables are unfortunately reversed, 80% of the restaurant is kitchen (for one dude, the owner, I may add).

Cost: 5. Quality Latin/Mexican at a great price for freshness and quality.  Burritos more expensive (~$9) than tacos and other options, but they also make Chipotle burritos looks like they're featured in a Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Burrito movie.

Food Quality: 4. Burritos pretty good, tacos very very good. Try the chicken or fish tacos.  The owner (Antonio) claimed to me he flies the red snapper in fresh every 3 days, which in Cleveland is about the best you can get.  They DO serve beer here, contrary to other reviews (thank goodness).

Service: 3. Antonio was only one working which was fine, but was doing random things when we walked in and it took him at least 5 minutes to at least say hi and take our order.

When to return: Pick-up, not dine-in.  If you want a cheap, high quality meal.  When you don't want Chipotle."}
{"text":"Yes it is a strange place. The way everything is run is weird and the food sometimes takes too long...they are understaffed and yes it can be quite pricey...you may even have a bad service experience, although it seems as though they are trying to hire more staff. BUT the food is absolutely out of this world, any and every time I have ever been. The blend of vanilla bean, honey, spice and agave that he incorporates into his dishes is so unique, I have never had anything like it. I have been here many times, most recently Monday 6/25. The food was AMAZING. We had carnitas/veggie queso, hacienda salad (which has potatoes, green beans, avocado and squash!!), and one of their dinner plates the Honey Cinnamon Chicken. Everything was spot on and I seriously can not rave enough about the food. 

So in conclusion, go here and eat."}
{"text":"Smallish restaurant but does boy does it have style. Food is made-to-order and you can watch the prep if you really need to. Vegan and Vegetarian friendly, the owner is helpful in describing ingredients in dishes. I think this place may have had the best chips & salsa, make that salsas, I have ever experienced. And Horchata! Haven't found a place in Cleveland before or since that had it. For those of you who like the drinky drink its BYOB so bring that tequila with ya!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend on the West Side of Cleveland when we decided we wanted some Mexican or Tex-Mex for dinner. My friend said he had driven by \"some mexican place\" many times and wanted to finally try it. So we went there and... well, I have no idea what the food tastes like.

Atmosphere seemed fine. Prices were more than standard junk Mexican food, but it seems the food here is a notch above standard fare. Well, the cashier who takes the order did not know what was on the Tamale Pie (which was the special and it's not on the menu) and deferred to Antonio. Turns out Antonio lacks all people skills and was incredibly unprofessional and rude. I asked another question about the huevos rancheros and received an even ruder response. Oh, and while I'm trying to order, the cashier, as I'm talking to her, answers the phone. Right in the middle of me trying to order. Now, I've never had serious complaints when eating out, other than slow service or something like that, and I've never complained, because I like to think of myself and pretty easygoing. Im certainly not demanding. But between both the cashier and Antonio treating me and my friend very unprofessionally and rudely, we walked out. I've never walked out of a place like that and I've never been that angry about rude service. And, really, I have no idea why I received such rude, unprofessional service. I just asked about the special and another dish. That. was. it. And, seeing here on Yelp, apparently I'm not the only one with complaints about their service.

Given the awful service here, there's no chance I would consider going back."}
{"text":"A friend and I had a hankering for some Mexican food and tried this place on a whim on a calm, late Wednesday night. I had always driven by this place, but had never stepped inside or inquired much about it. Most \"Americanized Mexican\" places bore me (too much salt, no flavor), especially after having worked in one for years in Florida before moving to Cleveland. 

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's small and quaint with an intimate seating area and fashionable decor (I believe the owner features his own art in the dining room). The music is nice and at a volume where it sets a hospitable atmosphere and a calm tone so you can enjoy it without having to scream at your friends. It wasn't terribly busy; I believe only two other two-tops were enjoying their dinner when we arrived.

You place your order at a counter with the owner, Antonio Carafelli. He's really fun to talk to and really knows his stuff! He's really passionate about what he does, and it shows in his cooking. Service wasn't especially fast, but that is no complaint because my friend and I wanted to relax and enjoy ourselves without feeling rushed. 

While we did not order any beer or margaritas (tempting as they were), we started our meal off with the tortilla soup and quesadillas. I had the soup and it absolutely blew me away. I love soup (seriously; I'll order it even if it's 90-degrees out), and this is easily one of the top three tortilla soups I've ever had; the other two being while visiting Mexico and Belize. Everything tasted fresh and not like it had been stewing in a pot all day smothered with salt. It's a definite must-try! My friend ordered the quesadillas and thought they were amazing and served with some sort of delicious slaw in a larger molcajete bowl. The soup and the quesadillas could have been meals, on their own. Absolutely stunning and would definitely order both again.

We both ordered the large and in charge handheld chicken burritos, thinking we'd have room. Woof. We ended up splitting one and taking the other home with us! The textures of everything inside the burrito to the tortilla itself was absolutely perfect. The chicken could easily tear apart and was cooked flawlessly, the rice was not overdone, and everything had a perfect balance of spice and flavor. One note: I'm not a huge fan of any sort of beans, but for anything Mr. Carafelli cooks, I'll make an exception because they tasted fantastic. 

I definitely say give El Tango a stop, relax, bring an empty stomach, and enjoy the atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were going to go to another Mexican-ish place down the street, but if it's only 5 and there's people waiting outside in the rain I'm going to go somewhere else. So we drove around and found El Tango. I'm glad we did. I had a California burrito. It was a little less dense than what I'm used to, which is strangely nice since now I don't feel like I just swallowed a brick. Big ol' chunks of just-right avocado in there. Shredded chicken that was a great texture and cut right. Dee-lish. 

We also got chips and salsa. $5.50 seems a bit steep, but when Dude whips out a big bowl of chips and 4 VERY different salsas, the price is right. There was a nice standard Pico with plenty of cilantro (I like cilantro), a pineapple pico- I don't usually like fruit in my salsa but I kept going back to this. The Barcelona Cream looks confusing but it's crema, jicama, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, and some other seasonings. NOMZ. The only one I wasn't impressed by was one with cinnamon in it, but I'm not crazy about cinnamon. 2 beers, 2 entrée burritos (with meat and cheese), and an interesting and generous chips & salsa plate. $33 and some change. I

The door opens inward BTW, which is weird, but I'm just telling you so you don't feel like a dope like I did. 

We only waited 10-15 minutes for our food, but we started the dinner rush so I don't think the wait was out of line.  I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"Best mexican food, hands down. But forget everything you know and expect from a typical restaurant experience. You have to understand that nothing is typical about this place.  Rule number one: Only go if you aren't in a hurry. Food this great takes time. Rule number two: See rule number one.

Let's start with when you enter. Immediately turn right and order from the counter. You will likely order from a guy in a cowboy hat. This is the owner/chef/server/busboy. The guy is doing everything.  By himself. Why? I don't know.  But don't worry about why. Just order something that strikes your fancy. You can't go wrong. Now order a margarita made from fresh fruits and juices. It will keep you company while you sit down and wait for your meal. And yeah, you will wait. But that is because he is making it to order right now. Hear that chopping from the kitchen?  He is cutting up your meats and veggies right now. Right now! Nothing is prepared in advance. Even the chips and salsas are homemade.Trust me, you can taste the freshness. This isn't chipotle, people. 

When your food is ready, the lone chef (now server) will bring out the best tasting mexican food ever. It will be piping hot and insanely fresh tasting. You will have waited a little longer than at a typical mexican spot but it will taste better...waaay better. And you won't mind the wait, because you wanted an excuse to try a second margarita, anyway. 

Relax. Slow down. And enjoy."}

{"text":"They just recently opened for breakfast and my family stopped in to try it.  Let's say...YUMMMM.  Definitely a place to return to.   The hit for our family was a HUGE burrito named THE BIG ASS BURRITO. . And that it was.   Enough to split.  The fresh cactus margarita worth the trip.   Our visit was complimented by a sweet waitress  named Jenny/Jennifer.  Look forward to going back.

UPDATE..Sadly I went back and the owner was a bit rude.   No water brought out to tables in glasses, purchase only.  Didn't like hearing him ask waitress \"if that was all we were ordering\" very indignant.   We ordered 4 meals one wasn't hungry."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had... hands down! Cozy atmosphere.. you have to try the chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"This place just makes me sad, it used to be so good. The food quality has taken a hit along with the service, which has just taken a nosedive from what it used to be. Now that we have El Carnicero in our neighborhood we go there instead, and hey, El Carnicero has better food AND doesn't charge for water (WTF?)."}
{"text":"Imagine you went to Mexico and encountered an old grandma who could cook gourmet like no other. 

That's what you get here at El Tango.

Fantastic"}
{"text":"Honestly, if you EVER want to run a successful restaurant let alone a successful business, you need good customer service, and you definitely want your customers to feel welcomed to this fabulous location. Yet both are extremely unsatisfactory. Also this place likes to open whenever the owner feels like it. Half the time it's closed in the middle of the day. I've ate here 3 times and the food has always been extremely above average, it's definitely good. All 3 times the guys there just seemed extremely rude and careless about us. It's just sad to see such incompetence from an owner that I'd rather eat shoe leather from someone else then fork over $$ towards someone of his nature.

I don't think I'm harsh either by any means, I've tried it once, tried it twice, and tried it a third time hoping I might of only just caught them on a bad time previously and all 3 times it was like I was talking to grumpy little children. I do not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Its been 3 years since we've relocated from Southern Ca and we now lament every moment we've spent without having had this extraordinarily delicious little restaurant in our lives. Went on a Saturday date -night and had an amazing meal. We were delighted that the owner/chef came table-side to ensure that we were enjoying our meal, which we wholeheartedly affirmed. The tortilla soup was delicious. The chorizo chicken apple-taco was incredible. The queso fundido was divine. Thank goodness somebody finally figured out horchata here in Cleveland, as we've been waiting 3 years to find a latin restaurant that serves it here. Decor is adorable. What a wonderful meal we had. So glad to know you El Tango Latin Grill, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"El Tango is a true hole in the wall place of Latin food & let me tell you, IT IS GOOD!  I can never get enough of El Tango.  You have to order the food at the counter and you will need to wait.  El Tango rarely pre-prepare heat and serve.  But the wait is so worth it - don't miss their chips and salsa(s) - a combination of in house baked thick chips with cilantro salsa, hot salsa, and cinnamon based salsa.  The chips and salsa alone can be filling, but please don't do injustice to your taste-buds with just their chips and salsa.   The inside is a fun atmosphere filled with bright colors that make you feel warm (or could be the hot salsa too). Their kitchen is open to the ordering area so you can see them preparing all the tasty dishes. Their price ranges between $8 to $15 and for the portion served this is excellent pricing.

El Tango have some of the staples of Latin foods - huge burritos, quesadilla, etc but they also have some rotating Latin items and each time I've tried these items I could not have enough - the only problem, well good for the wallet - their portions are quite large almost to the point where each dish can be shared between two.  They have a BYOB policy - mix it up Latin style with their food and a nice red wine and spend the hours away in this little hidden escape."}
{"text":"So, turns out I'm wrong in my assumption that Mexican food is supposed to always be bland. My friends and I stopped in to El Tango today when we were visiting Cleveland, and it was fantastic. From the chef in the cowboy hat who knew where the record store is that we were looking for, to the eclectic and creative dishes and the sassy decor - yessss. 

The burritos are HUGE, so bring an appetite. My two guy friends and I got burritos, and none of us could finish more than half. Mine was the fish california avocado lime burrito, which was outstanding. It was so flavorful, and included shredded pork and beef as well as generous amts of grilled fish and chunks of avocado. My other friend got a quesedilla, which was the most appetizing quesedilla I have ever seen ever ever (I'm generally not a huge fan). It was shredded beef, and was very thick, and although she didn't finish it, it looked well worth the effort. We had originally thought the place was a bit pricey, but one of my friends has been to El Tango before and says he dreams of it (we live in Columbus) and so he insisted that we stop - what an amazing recommendation. The prices are not at all expensive for the quality of this food, nevermind the unfinishable portions (if we hadn't been so full, I think we would have taken it home, but at the point, it was actually unthinkable). 

Considering that we were in Cleveland for a funeral, this was a welcome surprise for lunch, and an easy, friendly and warm place to be in a town we're mostly unfamiliar with. It made the day momentarily brighter! Thanks, El Tango!!"}
{"text":"12 minute wait time, 20 minute ticket time, nobody in the joint. Two other couples got drinks while we waited. They have no staff. They keep the lights off I guess to save electricity. Very festive inside. Waitress asked me three times what I wanted to drink. She reminded me of Moocher from the movie Breaking Away. Tacos served with corn, onion, cilantro and slaw. Coated with thyme and oregano on the outside. Wow. Delicious. Ill be back. Free parking in the rear.. Chips and salsa are $ 5.50."}
{"text":"Everyone is always talking about how crappy the service is here, but I always think it's okay.  Not great, but okay.  
As for the food, it's delicious.
The main minus for me is that for the growing number of conscientious and sustainable shoppers out there, you won't be happy to find that they serve bottles of water (which is just cafeteria-esque and out of place), and the only fish they serve is the highly endangered and overfished red snapper.  Ugh."}
{"text":"This place is a strange and unique restaurant.  It's vaguely Mexican, but it seems to go off more in its own direction--the food is unlike anything else, and very good.  Everything I have tried here has been both excellent and unique.

You order at the counter, but the service is always slow.  A great deal of effort is put into preparation of the food.  You must wait a while, but the food is worth the wait, if you have time.

The menu is not particularly large, but there is still enough variety to keep most people satisfied.  It changes from time to time.  The small menu makes it a bit less overwhelming--the food here can be a bit different, to say the least.

The atmosphere is a bit odd, but very nice.

Bottom line: this is a strange restaurant.  It serves good food, but there's something about it that doesn't mesh.  It's pricier and has slower service than most places with \"Taqueria\" in the name; the character of the food as well as slow service time doesn't really fit with the order-at-the-counter setup.  It feels like someone came along and just magically crossed a fancy gourmet restaurant with a cheap taco place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were really craving chips and salsa one day and I'm not talking tostitos style, but the real deal. We stopped in El Tango one afternoon and it ended up being the best decision ever. They give you 3 different types of salsa...salsa verde,  hot, and a spicy pineapple. My favorite was the spicy, chunky pineapple, but I enjoyed them all.  The guy cut and fried our tortilla chips as we were waiting, so they were as fresh as can be. This place is close to my new apartment so I'll definitely be back to try an actual meal and a marg."}
{"text":"Some of the best central American good I've ever had, including the meals I've eaten in Mexico, Nicaragua, Dominica (Caribbean, I know, but the cuisine shares similar characteristics), and Miami (let's be honest, ok?) If you want a lot of whiney bunched yelpanties to get in the way of a unique delectable culinary experience, then feel free to go to any other TexMex place. This is NOT TexMex. This is NOT southwestern. This is authentic Mexican, similar to what I found in Oaxaca and Colima. Expect fish, cinnamon, and sweet potatoes in the best recipes. And regarding the surly man in the hat that everyone cries about, a word of advice: Don't be annoying and you won't have a problem with him. I've been eating here for almost two decades and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Lakewood. The other reviewers are correct  about the cowboy-hat owner guy being on the eccentric side, but that just adds to the experience! Very casual and unpretentious. I like the fact that you order at the counter. And best of all, the food is really excellent. This is not your typical mexican food, the burritos have fresh herbs and really interesting flavors. Excellent margaritas also! Strange chef, unique atmosphere, fantastic food! This place is the real deal and I hope it stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"At first, the place seems dark and lonely, but with the lively music and stylish decor it's very welcoming and fun.  Kind of mysterious, but I was highly impressed with the man in the hat.  The man in the hat runs the entire show.  Literally the only person working there.  Solo Op.  Maybe it's different on weekends, but this was my experience there on a Tuesday evening.  I was surprised how well the man in the hat can cook in the dark.  I had my doubts, but he proved me wrong.  He was basically blindfolded and still pulled it off.  The soup and fish tacos I ordered were outstanding.  El Tango definitely has its own style.  It cannot be compared to other places of its kind.  It's truly unique and leaves its mark.  You will be very moved to come back."}
{"text":"I just moved to Lakewood and remembered how much I loved El Tango from 10 years ago, when I used to stop here for carryout on my way home from work in downtown CLE.  I was really excited to be so close to what I remember as my favorite mexican restaurant.  I read the yelp reviews and figured we could put up with a rude owner in exchange for the great food as I recall.  OMG!  This recent experience was crazy!  We called at 8:45 PM on Tuesday night to order carryout.  We ordered for two.  In the middle of placing the order, the owner hung up on us.  We called back to complete the order then asked how long it would take.  The owner (and I know he was the owner because I recognized his crappy attitude and voice) said it would take an HOUR for carryout because he was slammed.  Yet, there was no noise in the background, so we wondered where the crowd was?  However, we said ok, we'd be there in an hour.  We arrived at 9:45, 15 minutes before they closed at 10:00 PM.  And, THEY WERE CLOSED!!  We could not believe it.  What a jerk!!!  After reading the Yelp reviews and my experience with the owner from years ago, I believe the owner has a serious drinking and bi-polar problem.  He needs psychotherapy.  I wonder how he's been able to survive this long.  Yes, his prices are very high.  I could not believe he lied to us AND closed the restaurant that night early; leaving us at almost 10:00 PM wondering where to go for mexican food.

Having worked as a server/bartender during my college years (and making a boatload of $$ in tips) I rate restaurants on customer service first and food second.  
This was the WORST experience I've had at a restaurant in the last 20 years.  I feel sorry for this owner...he needs serious help psychologically, professionally and in the customer service dept.  Too bad because on a good day, his food from what I remember, was fantastic and we don't mind paying the overpriced for authenticity.  So now I wonder where to go in Lakewood for authentic mexican/latin american?
Momocho was just OK, but outside of the amazing guacamole, I don't love this place.  Luchitas perhaps?

I wish I could recommend this place.  I hope the owner gets help."}
{"text":"OK is a perfectly good way to describe this place.  Service was fine, no complaints there.  The food (I had Enchiladas) was, for me, a step above your standard \"Americanized Mexican\" fare, for about double the price.  No, I'm no expert on Latin American cuisine, so maybe I'm missing something, but I just was not that impressed.  Cute little place inside though.  I would definitely recommend trying it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Momocho Level Food and Prices- McDonalds Service-No A/C

I dropped $100 at this place where at any other place it would have been less than $50.  The food is a \"When Harry Met Sally\" experience.  No A.C on a 90 degree day.  The staff acted like they got pistol whipped in the back. The kitchen takes up 70% of the place. I left feeling confused, angry, hot, sweaty, and overwhelmed by the loud music.  It was an onslaught to the senses, a mismatch in food quality-prices-restaurant style that ultimately prevents me from enjoying this fine fresh cuisine.   If I ate there again I would likely carry out."}
{"text":"I live just down the road from el tango. I drive by all the time. It seems to not be very busy. After trying it for the first time yesterday I can't believe why. The regulars know what a great place it must be. I think once you try it ,you'll  be a repeat returner. You place your Order at the counter and they bring it out to you. It took awhile for the food to come out but after you get it you will know why. I'm looking forward to going back to try the tacos and salsa."}
{"text":"We live very close, eat out three nights a week at least, and I love authentic Mexican, but we won't ever go back because the service was so profoundly terrible. It was not that busy however we waited for an hour and ten minutes, which is excessive. What was worse though is that during that whole time nobody even said a word to us - not even a \"hey I know it's been a while, but ...\" or a \"Do you guys need anything else? Sorry bout the wait\". NOTHING. I could even get over that, however when I said something to cashier/server it was evident that he did not care at all. It was just a weird and rude exchange. It was so bad that this is my first Yelp review! In brief, if it's going to take a while, that's fine, but at least acknowledge that we are there and/or see if we need anything and don't be rude on top of it. The food is really good, but there are lots of awesome places to eat in our neighborhood so that is not enough to bring us back. I'm going to check out El Barrio."}
{"text":"Every time my friends and I go here, we have an absolute feast.  Dinner is always good with unique flavors (the 3 salsa's are amazing).  I crave the key lime pie.  It's the best that I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Dadgummit, this place is great. I went here with a friend on Saturday at 6. It was empty when we got there and ordered our food, and as we sat outside, we watched about 1,000 people come in after us. We definitely hit the sweet spot, time-wise.

Service was fast and friendly, ambiance was very nice, and the food -- my god, the food is great. I got the avocado burrito, while my hetero lifemate got fish tacos. The burrito was about as big as a newborn baby. (Mmm...newborn babies.) It was as fresh as fresh can be. 

The next time you contemplate making a run for the border, skip Taco Bell (and Chipotle) and hit this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Amazing lemonade.  The service is hit and miss, depends on how nice you are (tip - be nice).  I love the dark mole."}
{"text":"First time visitors here. Ordered the salsa and chips, lime shrimp tacos and beef torta. For my taste the 3 salsas were interesting but I felt they needed a little pop to change good/interesting to great (my opinion). The shrimp tacos.. Heaven! Excellent shrimp not overcooked, fresh corn and slaw awesome texture and flavor! The beef torta beef was tender and also not overcooked. The beans and corn add the flavor brightness you need with mole'. Owner is very friendly and rightfully proud of his products! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best burrito you can get, period.  It is not like any of the others in town.  I used to go a lot back when they first opened and didn't have a liquor license.  They let you byob.  But now they have really good margaritas.  You have to try it, I just wish it was open for lunch!"}
{"text":"I kid you not, best food you'll prob ever have, and margaritas are ridiculous good. Dont expect much for service or quick food time tho. The owner is as close to the soup Nazi from Seinfeld as you'll get. Just walk in put your head down say your please and thank yous when you order and just trust that it will all be worth it when food and drinks arrive. The guy opens and closes when he feels like it so don't let the 4-10 open-close hrs fool you.. plan on like 6:30 to 8 o'clock daily."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place.  Great salsas, high-quality ingredients.  One-man operation - so it can be a little slow and hours are spotty.  It's worth it if you catch them open.

Baked Burrito is excellent - with either sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Don't come here if you expect super fast service like typical Mexican places (in and out in under 30 min). 

There is no wait staff here. You order at a counter which overlooks a huge kitchen. The chef takes your order and cooks it and brings it out to you. He does it all. It does take some time if there are a lot of people (6 tables in the whole place), but the food is so worth it! If you order chips and salsa you will get four different kinds. My cheese quesadilla was the best I ever had and it came with this unique salad which also tasted amazing.

The atmosphere is intimate and feels like you stepped into Mexico. 

The margaritas are potent!"}
{"text":"The most amazing flavors combined!  The food is super fresh, and trio of salsas make any day better!"}
{"text":"So in all honesty, I partly tried this place because of the amusing posts everyone wrote about the sour owner and his contradictorily sweet recipes. I was expecting to either love my experience or hate it, and to have as passionate a response as everyone else seems to.

However, for me, the food was just...forgettable. I only remember that we got something for takeout, it was HUGE but overpriced, and we didn't feel especially welcome in the restaurant. For these prices I can't justify adding it to my go-to take-out restaurant list, so we probably won't be back. =("}
{"text":"I love this place! When walking in the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic and comfortable this place felt. You walk in and instead of having a waiter, you order at the front counter and they bring the food to your table. I came here with three friends and we ordered a fajita special to share. We were able to get our fill with the huge amount of food they brought out. We were the only ones there, so we didn't wait long and the food was perfect. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere that seems a little more authentic than the rest."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some real deal TexMex then this is the place to be. My girlfriend and I were craving tacos but had also decided to go out looking them on Cinco de Mayo... So everywhere was packed. We wandered into El Tango on a whim and the chef (who had also gotten short staffed and was running the whole place alone) told us it'd be an hour before we got food. We're patient people and figured we would wait wherever we went so we ordered with him and found a table. We ended up being the last new table he took the whole evening bc he was so slammed and he was actually only able to serve tacos and margaritas (they have a much wider menu normally though). We ordered our tacos, I got the pork tacos pinas and my gf got the chicken, along with two classic margs. Margaritas were huge and on point, but the food was the kicker. For a dude in a cowboy hat rocking it out completely alone and totally weeded he did fantastic. The carnitas was perfect, the slaw on the tacos was a great touch, and everything was just fresh and tasty. Honestly it was worth the hour long wait. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking for real Mexican food done really well."}
{"text":"This has always been a favorite place for us.

I had an excellent vegetarian burrito which had many flavors. 

My Wife had her favorite fish taco.

Loved the strawberry margarita.

We left with our favorite Key Lime Pie."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I walked in here one night and were the only ones in the place.  It was very dark inside, but it was still a pretty nice atmosphere.  The staff was nice and our food was very good.  As with Dan, we got our drinks in cans.  With the amount of money that I paid for that can, I wish we would have gotten fountain drinks.  I spent a little more money here than I was hoping, but it was still a pretty solid place."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Our party had a salad, a couple burritos, tacos, and a quesadilla. Everything was outstanding. The homemade chips came with an array of delicious salsas including a chipotle cinnamon and a crèma unlike anything I've ever had. My fish taco was crispy and succulent, delicately flavored with a bit of classic cabbage. I savored every bite. 
The food took a good while because it is all made from scratch. Wow. 
This is no ordinary taqueria. This is taqueria taken to a higher dimension."}
{"text":"Delicious!
Don't be alarmed by the walk-up counter. Order your food and pick a seat.
BYOB. I got the sun-tea, and was provided with free refills.
We got the salsa and some guacamole to start. We both agreed that the guacamole was the best either of us had ever had. The salsa: three bowls. Pico de gallo, pineapple-tomatillo, and a cinnamon. The first two bowls were delicious, and the third bowl went mostly untouched.
I wasn't very hungry - I got a chicken taco ($3). It came on two tortillas, presumably to prevent tearing. The chicken was perfectly prepared, and there was a tasty drizzling of what I have concluded was agave nectar. 
He got the $7 burrito. It had a nice portion of black beans in it, and he wasn't able to eat it all. He was very impressed with the quality and portion.
I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"El Tango is a good option in Lakewood for something decent and relatively cheap. The inside is dark and weird. There are a lot of plastic cacti. I have tried a very variations of the hand held burritos and enjoyed them. They are pretty large and filling. I haven't seen the guy in the cowboy hat for a while. He was always a kind person. I prefer the burritos here to Chipotle or Ohio City Burrito. My brother comes here sometimes and gets vegan food, so I guess their menu has stuff like that. I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see so many positive reviews.  Maybe I caught them on a bad, fly-infested day because my experience was both of those things.  I came here with my father looking forward to trying the burritos.  The guy behind the counter basically carried the attitude that he didn't want to be there and was nothing short of obnoxious with us.  We would have left but we made a pretty long trip to get there.  The burritos weren't that bad (hence the 2 star rating) but were grossly overpriced.  

The environment itself made the entire meal more unappetizing.  My dad and I sat by the window and we had this lovely view: https://www.msu.edu/user/kimkevin/SSPX0235.jpg
Those little lines are flies, and the entire window was covered with them.  How this place has passed any department of sanitation inspections is beyond me."}
{"text":"One of a kind.  The best burritos I've ever had.  Great ambiance.  The owner is one of the best kept secrets in Cleveland. One hundred percent satisfied"}
{"text":"I did not read any of the previous reviews before coming here, mainly because the guy across the street recommended this place for good food and drinks and because I love the signage. We started off with chips and salsa and a couple of cactus pear margaritas. The chips and salsa come with three different salsas- a pineapple one, apple chipotle, and a regular pico de gallo. They were all very delicious. I got a quesadilla- it was great, cheesy and sweet on the tortilla. My husband got the California burrito, and loved that as well! The cactus pear margaritas were SOO good. We will definitely be coming back! As far as the service goes, I understand where people would think Anthony was rude, he's definitely blunt, But I love the irony of walking into a Mexican place and seeing a definitely white man in a cowboy hat and boots making quesadillas. I loved the atmosphere, I adored the margaritas and the food was beyond satisfying! We will definitely come back. Check out Play It Again Sam's right across the street for some records or a turn table to go with your Tex Mex."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and super good. No complaints- the burritos seemed pricey at first, but the fresh salsa (4 kinds!) more than made up for it. I couldn't decide between the chipotle/cinnamon, green salsa with pineapple, some white cream sauce called Barcelona cream, and a straight forward pico de gallo that was perfectly balanced.

The burrito was wetter than I would have liked, but I ate every last bite!"}
{"text":"El Tango is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I used to eat here quite often when I lived in Lakewood. These days I'm calling Olmsted Falls home so I sadly don't get there quite as often. That being said, the place is amazing. The atmosphere is cozy with a touch of kitsch. The food is incredible. The place is loaded with character. 

There are a few reviews that seem to take issue with the owner. Antonio is certainly eccentric, but that only adds to what I like about this place. He's a real person, not some spit-shined middle manager you'd find at a chain restaurant. He is what he is and he makes some incredible food. And he's funny. If he makes some snarky comment about a question you ask, just roll with it instead of leaving in a huff. 

Bear with me as I'm not a food writer. As a vegetarian, there is quite a bit on the menu that is simply off limits to me. That being said, the California burrito is to die for. Antonio adds things to his food that you might not normally expect: sweet potatoes, cabbage, carrots - and they meld wonderfully with the more traditional fillings. If you get the chip sampler, you're going to take a selection of four different dippings and salsas that he prepares from scratch. This isn't to be missed."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and WOW! I got the California burrito,  added cheese because duhhh, and it was so delicious! There is some kind of magical topping with sweetness to it on top of the burrito too. And my happy hour $5 mango margarita is the BEST margarita I've ever had! Ok, ok....top 3 though definitely. Service was quick and great,  patio opens tomorrow! Great because I'm already craving it again."}
{"text":"So a couple of weeks back my wife and I met another couple out at El Tango. Being as we paid with a credit card I had to leave my tip up front as there are no servers to wait on you really. Glad I didn't leave anymore $ than I did. The side of rice that came with our meals was still crunchy and completely inedible. Later on while we were eating one of the cooks was smoking in the kitchen. It was completely obvious since the restarunt is essentially one giant room and the smoke drifted to where we were dining at. I shall try it one more time but first impression left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing. The food was AMAZING! The drinks were amazing. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that for the price (fajitas for two, chips and salsa and two margaritas - 60 bucks) I would like it to be a full service restaurant. Paying for a nice meal is not a problem but I would at least like to have a glass of water or be able to order a second margarita. But with that being said still one of the best meals I've ever had, every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Stellar food...visually fun and delicious, owner is one cool cat \"I'll be back\". A hidden gem."}
{"text":"MMMMMMM!  The honey chicken is so moist, delicious, and the sides are fantastic!  Don't expect to be waited on, enjoy the fact that you pay....find a cozy table, and relax. No one breathing down your neck."}
