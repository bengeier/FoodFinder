{"text":"It's like a smalltown diner. All the people there know each others names. Amazing food with decent sized portions.  Just walk in and find your seat"}
{"text":"Nostalgia! Place looks like and old Howard Johnson's. Great comfort food. They have pierogies. And Mama Joe's pies for dessert!"}
{"text":"Probably the best hometown diner I've eaten at in years. Breakfast was homemade and fresh. Seriously this was awesome and I know good food. French toast was spot on. Service was decent but the food was the star. Excellent sausage links with a side order of real home fries. Wish this place was close to home. Good price for what you get."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Great home style sandwiches and very affordable."}
{"text":"I gotta say, this place used to be a good place to have breakfast on the go from time to time when it opened several years back. The food was hot and the coffee was good at least.   It had been at least a year or two since I had been here but this last time (11-2013), the food was cold, bacon was burnt and hard and my French toast was too dry and cold as well.   Maybe it was an off day but based on the other reviews, it appears to be a problem going on in the last year.   I have meet the owner since the place opened and she is very friendly. She is very welcoming toward any customer and really appreciates regulars. I feel I must tell her about the latest food quality issues :( Will update if this happens."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, Its a family favorite. I always find something on the daily specials. I have never had a bad meal yet. We bring out of town family to eat here. They have asked of we can go back when they are in town. Nothing fancy here just a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant with good food and friendly staff. Portions are large and reasonably priced. My family really liked the breaded veal, without the gravy, but there are plenty of good options, most of which come with at least soup and salad. Our waitress was very attentive ands found ways to cater to my children's tastes. Well worth the price, don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Generally friendly service, but severely lacking quality food.  For instance, tattooed chicken. Would it really kill them to purchase fresh poultry?  I guess that's the cost of going to a cheap restaurant.  The other dishes appear greasy, but hey it's a greasy spoon, right?  The parking lot always appeared full, so I was hoping that this was a diamond in the rough, turns out it's the rough & tumble. Certainly not my first choice."}
{"text":"You'd never know by looking at it but this place is a gem.  Service is great - everyone is very friendly.  I almost always go with breakfast.  The gyro omelette, add spinach, tomato, and feta with a side of tzatziki.  I'm in heaven.  I've tried replicating it at other diners and not a chance.  The prices are as affordable as it gets and the food quality?  It's a diner so what are you expecting?  It's clean and stays pretty busy.  I just really love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. The omelettes are delicious, the bacon is the best I've ever had, the hash browns are perfect. Even the toast is superior! Sometimes there is a line, but it is so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive but the quality of the food is lacking. You do get what you pay for and in this case I paid for the fried fish special which was frozen fish wedges that were over cooked and greasy. Fries were good and it came with a salad. The bowl of chowder was bland and thick with flour."}
{"text":"Would avoid this place if possible. Quality and cleanliness are not top priorities here. If you want a breakfast plate for a few bucks it will work. But otherwise avoid."}
{"text":"Great place for a traveler to have breakfast. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. I had a Belgium waffle with whip cream and strawberries and the waitress arranged the toppings into a smiley face. Despite some reviews I've read, the quality of the food was great."}
