{"text":"This is some seriously delicious Caribbean food in Leslieville.   The walls of this joint are decorated with old reggae records and definitely make the place feel a lot warmer and inviting than the old Queen Pita that occupied this space for as long as I can remember.  We started with the jerk chicken salad with avocado. The chicken and salad were a great combination - the right mix of greens and tomatoes with the deliciously-spiced chicken. A bit more chicken would have been appreciated.  We shared oxtail stew and curried ram as our mains which were served with rice and peas. Both dishes were rich and meaty and had us licking the bones wanting more.  We washed everything down with over-proof rum and ginger beer. A great combo. :)  I'd definitely recommend The Hummingbird to anyone who is looking for authentic Jamaican food in a comfortable setting in the east end."}
{"text":"The best roti I have ever had in Toronto hands down. I had the veggie roti. My friend had the oxtail dinner and it was so tender and tasty. Don't let the asthetics fool you (they aren't the greatest) but please go in for the food. You won't regret it. Otis the owner was so friendly and made us feel so welcome. He even gave us samples of callaloo and coconut cream pie. It was a fun time. Great tunes also."}
{"text":"Leslieville, with its overabundance of stroller-pushing moms frequenting cupcake shops, might seem an unlikely locale to open up a Caribbean restaurant. But me tink it's a good idea dey did.  Vibe: Casual, clean and comfortable -- this joint is the last place you'd find pretense. Rows of classic reggae record covers -- from Bob Marley to Desmond Dekker and Peter Tosh -- line its yellow-orange walls. Simple dining tables arranged to seat about 20 or so are each adorned with fresh-cut flowers. Although the space is small, there's plenty of room to move about. A cut-out in the wall allows plain view to the cook's stirring up oxtail stew in the back. There is also a patio going in the back when summer hits -- likely a good spot for a couple of cold Red Stripes.  Goods: Decided to put the jerk chicken -- a de factor standard for any true Caribbean restaurant. It was paired with Jamaican-style coleslaw and side of rice medley -- each with superb taste. The jerk spice seemed to be a mixture of a wet marinade and dry rub, and was thick and aromatic. Hints of peppers, cloves and cinnamon lingered long after each bite. The chicken leg was very juicy, though it was a little on the small side and left me wanting more.  Service: After the meal, the owner came to introduce himself, ask about the meal and chat about reggae and Jamaican culture. It was obvious that he's genuinely interested in positive ties with the neighbourhood and welcomed feedback. On the house, he had the chef bring out a feature dessert they'd been working on. It was a base of Jamaican festival (a sweet doughy bread) with pureed banana, maple syrup and a drizzle of Appleton rum -- unbelievable!  Bottom line: Price is right for the quality of the food and ambience of the restaurant. They also do take-out (apparently a lot of rotis go through the door). Here's to hoping enough neighbourhood locals swing by to support the Hummingbird."}
{"text":"This is another great addition to the neighborhood. I have been here for takeout 3 times since they opened shortly before Christmas. It is a couple who started the place and they are very friendly and welcoming.   I have had both beef patties and the Roti, both were great. The beef patties were very fresh and are available in mild and spicy. The roti was very good, and a decent portion size. The bread was very fresh, as well as the chicken.  The sauce had a nice balance of heat and flavor. Those who prefer some heat might want' to ask for more spice. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Earnest addition to the local vibe with tasty West Indian flavours!!  The Hummingbird opened up a couple months back and I think it's still getting it's groove from a service standpoint, but the food is excellent and fills the gap left by the Real Jerk's closure.  It's a home-cooking kinda place, so if you come with those expectations, you will enjoy the food.    I've had the Ox Tail on rice and the Shrimp Curry.  Both portions were generous and both were tasty!  The Ox Tail had a delicious savoury taste and the meat was tender and juicy.  The shrimp curry had a plenty of kick and the shrimp were plump and firm.  Both were served with a side of julienned cabbage, which was surprisingly tasty!!!    The restaurant was super busy (unexpectedly, I think) when we were there, so the server(s) and kitchen were totally overwhelmed.  The chef gave us some free jamaican patties and plenty of apologies to tie us over while we had to wait for our meals.  In my books, nice gestures and genuine apologies can make up for slow food service.  We didn't mind the wait as we felt well taken care of.  Atmosphere is super casual with a nice Caribbean vibe.  It's not too big with probably 2-3 larger tables (6-8) and the rest are for 2s and 4s.    We definitely plan to 'hum' our way back to the Hummingbird!"}
{"text":"Hummingbird just opened this year.  I walked past many times before finally giving it a try.  I ordered a Chicken Roti and a Jamaican patty.  Unfortunately, they were out of patties, so I was only able to get the Roti.  The guy put the order through but then changed course and said \"actually I have one ready that I can sell you\".  This made me wonder about the quality - I was worried it might be dry - but I took it without saying anything.  I should have trusted my instincts.  The Roti was indeed dry.  Unfortunately, it also didn't have much flavour.  There was too much potato, and not much else, including spices.  I took it home and ate it with my own hot sauce.    This seems like the food that would appeal to people who haven't had a good Roti before.  Or people who don't eat this kind of food very often at all.  As it's the only place of its type in the area, it will probably get decent reviews.  I've had much better.  This place just isn't in the same league as some of the better, comparable establishments in Toronto.  The staff were pleasant, so I will try this place at least one more time in the future.  Hopefully the food is better - If it is, I'll probably upgrade my rating at that time.  If not - we'll see."}
{"text":"Good, but not great . . . Yet! I see some great potential in this place, it's a nice fit to the neighborhood.  I read the reviews before hand and decided we'd try it out. I brought my BF and his parents. . it was relaxed and friendly and suuuper slooow.   Food was tasty, and portions were fine. We were all happy with our meals, it was a little under 2 hours from start to finish.  So if you're in a hurry it's not FAST food, but it's good and worth a try. Roti $10.00 So, you decide if that's value. I've had better for less,  and worse for more. . . .so it's a wash."}
{"text":"This place is now closed and boarded up. I guess it never had a chance to make it in this area."}
{"text":"Really great addition to Leslieville among the usual trendy offerings.  The food is delicious (ordered veggie roti, plantains, rice and peas and bammy) and the owner/chef and staff really nice.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous meal!  We love this place!  I ordered the curry goat which was tender and flavorful with the right bite of heat.  My husband had the jerk chicken, which was also fall-off-the- bone tender.  Don't listen to the negative reviews. This place is without a doubt one of the best Jamaican joints I have visited and I use to live in Miami. The owners are so welcoming and warm and the tunes are jamming.  A wonderful respite to a hot July day."}
