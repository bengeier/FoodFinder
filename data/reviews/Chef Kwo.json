{"text":"Wow, just stopped in for a quick lunch and so glad I did. The food tasted amazing and the service was outstanding. I'm very picky and I will definitely be back with family."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices.  They also deliver fast and are very friendly.  I highly recommend it to all in ballentyne.  We have ordered from Chef Kwo a couple of times and love it!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch a few days ago.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken with Pork Fried Rice.  I thought the food was good overall.  The chicken was good, but they dont serve it with broccoli like they do in NY.  Just my observation....... Also, the pork in the rice was shredded pork, they pork used in NY is diced pork.  The egg roll was pretty good.  Not greasy at all.  I dont give this place 4 stars because while the chicken was definitely good, the rice was a little bland.  Not tasteless by any means, but lacked a little for my personal taste.  The restaurant looked very clean which is always good!!  I will return to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"It's an American Chinese restaurant.  The food is done well.  If you get a spicy dish, they will give you what they believe an American handle...even if you ask for, \"hot...I mean...really hot...very spicy...really really hot and spicy!\"  I ate my whole order without flinching or one bead of sweat hitting my forehead.  FYI  Try:  The General Tso's (yes, it's not really Chinese, but they do it well here)  Avoid:  Looking for spicy dishes"}
{"text":"I was compelled enough to write this review.  My family and I have been ordering take out from here for years. With that said, we really enjoyed this place until last Friday.  My wife and I decided to grab a quick bite from an old reliable but sadly discovered that Chef Kwo was sold to another family/owner.  The menu was the same but the food and the way the dishes were totally different.  I hate to write such a negative review however with the change of ownership lead me to change our views of this place.  The food was NOT GOOD at all! Sorry that this place has changed so much and I will be shocked if they stay open very long.  I give it until the end of 2014/first half of 2015 at best until they close their doors."}
{"text":"Best take out place for a Chinese food in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Take out order - good meal, but no shrimp in the shrimp and chicken broccoli order. Fortune cookie must have been in the original batch ever made it was so stale. Very nice won ton soup."}
{"text":"So I had a craving for some Chinese food and ran across this place...and  glad I did! The food and service was awesome!  They have several options but I was on the mood for something different do I tried the Sa Cha Shrimp, it's one of the combination specials on their lunch and dinner menu. The meal comes with shrimp, green peppers, red peppers, water chestnuts, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini  fried rice and an egg roll.   I asked them to make it extra spicy and I could really taste the hot peppers and the brown sauce they cooked it in was delicious! Perfect flavors and a very delicious meal!  But probably the best thing about this place are the employees. When I walked in the lady behind the register waved me in and said \" hello\" a call came in so another employee came from the back to help me and in face suggested the dish I ordered after I told her what my craving was for!   For this to be my first visit, I was more than WOW-ed with my experience. Great service and Great food means that I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Yelp has never disappointed...until now.  Decided on take out based on the high rating from yelp.  It was a Sunday night and frankly not that busy, but the staff seemed disorganized and the cooks were in the weeds.  The patrons waiting were all getting frustrated waiting 30 plus minutes for take out.  Not a single table was taken and there were only three other families waiting on take out orders.  After a long wait, we finally got our order and the food was below average for the price.  My kids ordered lo mein and it was bland and hardly had any veggies at all.  I won't go back, ever. I'll go to Jo Jo's China bistro and pay just a few more dollars next time."}
{"text":"My husband was really in the mood for Chinese and I had already passed our normal favorite spot Tai Pei South. I had to go to Harris Teeter in Ballantyne, so I thought I would order takeout from here because it is in the same shopping center.   We had eaten here before, but I couldn't remember what we thought so I called and ordered (without a menu) and the woman who picked up was helpful. On some dishes like the chicken and broccoli they do a combo, with fried rice and an eggroll. On pasta dishes like chicken lo mein, an eggroll is extra. I also ordered chicken won ton soup. All together it came out to about $20. I think it was a little expensive, because we are used to getting out the door for around $15.   They said 10 minutes, but it was really 20... not a big deal as they were busy and it was 1 woman taking orders, and 1 man cooking (assuming a husband and wife ownership deal).   The food was very good. Not as greasy as Chinese can sometimes be. I think it's a great place for takeout, and if I am in the same situation I would do it again, minus the broccoli and chicken combo (just the entree) and maybe a side of fried rice."}
{"text":"I picked up some takeout on the way home last night from Chef Kwo and thought it was ok. Honestly, I would have preferred Wan Fu, but it was a bit out of the way and I was in a hurry so I just went for something close by.  My S.O. and I both got Kung Pao Chicken.  This place does not offer brown rice, so we just got steamed white rice. We also got a side of 2 egg rolls  & a spring roll, which brought the total to around $27.00    The food was ok, typical of a take-out Chinese place in a strip shopping center. My S.O liked it better than the takeout we got at the Wok on Providence Rd. However, I think I slightly prefer the Wok over Chef Kwo. Both places could stand to put a little more chicken in the dishes.   Each place seems to make Kung Pao with different veggies, and I don't prefer the veggies they use at Chef Kwo.  Also, I noticed a produce sticker on a piece of Bell Pepper in my food last night, so that sort of put me off.  Obviously, they don't wash the veggies well before using, but that is probably the case at most of these types of establishments.   The white rice was super sticky, and not really the best rice I've had.  However, overall it was ok for what it is, and I would be willing to give them another try."}
{"text":"Just had Kung Pao Chicken lunch. Pretty sure what I just ate (because I was very hungry) was NOT CHICKEN. I had few bites and tossed the rest. There were a few pieces of real broccoli, but other than that, I can say nothing good about it."}
{"text":"We get take-out from here every weekend! Fresh, non-greasy, really great Chinese food. The specials are great - I tend to get the chicken w/ broccoli which comes with fried rice and an egg roll.   The staff are all lovely, and this has become a favorite place of ours."}
{"text":"Great online website with one of the best online ordering I've seen. This is my fav place to get quick Chinese food to go."}
{"text":"Yum, just had the sesame chicken dinner combo, asked for it to be made a little spicy and is perfectly done.  Fried rice is good, takeout was ready in 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"My usual lunch spot. Good food and reasonable prices. Friendly server who knows my order when I walk in. Fast service as well."}
{"text":"Tried to order delivery ... But they really didn't seem to want to take my order. Due to the fact they had two orders in front of me and it was slightly raining outside . Very bad first impression.  I would have been willing to wait but they really didn't seem to want my business."}
{"text":"If you work in Ballantyne and want a reasonably priced, quick, and tasty lunch, you need to bring it on down to the Kwo.  I go here about once a week with some of my co-workers and we enjoy it every time.    The folks here are friendly and very accommodating  to special requests.  If you want it hot, tell them and they'll crank it up.  If you want steamed rice instead of fried, just let them know and it's done.  Just order it up at the counter, have a seat, and they'll bring it out to you with utensils and all the sauces you need.  The lunch menu is full of really reasonably priced items, ranging from 6-8 bucks.  I've had a lot of the items on the menu and they are all pretty tasty.  My favorite is the Kong Bo Chicken.  If you don't like the heat of the Kong Bo, I suggest the Moo Good Gai Pan.  Whatever you choose, you'll get a nice portion complete with rice and an egg roll (or spring roll).  It's enough to send you into an afternoon food coma.     This is a great little spot and I recommend giving it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous...I can't even tell you about the quality of their food because it hasn't got here yet...we ordered 2 hours ago and have called numerous times with no results...was hung up on...placed on hold for  over 10 minutes several times!!! I and the 9 other people that ordered with me are starving and livid...and we have already been charged for this food we do not have yet!!! Needless to say we will not be going back to this God forsaken place!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place tonight after seeing an elderly woman placing a flyer in our door. I felt bad  that she was out there climbing the stairs going door-to-door in our complex, and I also have a lot of respect for people who go the extra mile. Because of this, I made it a point to get delivery from here this week.  We usually order Chinese from The Wok about 1-2 times per week, and it's just okay. Until now, it was the best chinese we could find in Ballantyne. UNTIL NOW.   I'm so glad I ignored the subpar reviews because this place is amazing!!! Unlike other Chinese places, this one isn't greasy and artificial tasting. The fried rice was fresh, the General Tso's chicken (not spicy) was perfect, and the brown sauce with the hibachi vegetables is delicious. I did not care for the hibachi chicken cuts, but I have never really cared for those from any Chinese place. Next time, I'm gonna order the hibachi veggies by themselves. They were also very fresh and cooked perfectly! I'm SO impressed!!!  Delivery took about 50 minutes (they told us it would be 1 hour), and they were extremely apologetic for it \"taking too long\". We weren't bothered at all, but it was very obvious this girl holds herself to a higher standard.  From now on, this will be our go-to Chinese place. I love the food, and I love the work ethic of the family that runs this place."}
{"text":"STOP THE PRESS! I rarely submit an unreservedly given 5 star review but I actually am in mid-dinner and stopped to deliver it. WOW! This food is awesome! I got delivery and the food came fast and was searing fresh and hot!  The delivery man was grateful and sweet.  The Sa Cha Shrimp is spectacular! Fresh veggies, generous serving of shrimp. And the sauce ... The sauce is Flavorful, complex, YUMMY!! Who made my dinner? I wanna kiss him on the mouth.  Chef Kwo is now my go to Asian food spot. Hands down."}
{"text":"Just ordered from this place ... After debating for months to try it.  The food is great and the delivery was fast and the prices are reasonable.    I ordered the spicy orange beef, vegetable fried rice and spring rolls.  Very very good!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this place so it's easy for us to order and pick up.  We've had delivery a number of times with no problems.  The food is good for take out. However, tonight, they told us it would be 30 - 40 minutes for delivery, when I said forget it the woman on the phone said - we will be quicker - well it's been 1.5 hours since we ordered and still waiting  We called 40 minutes ago and they said they were on the way. We are less than 1 mile from them.  we called back and the man who answered said we have a lot of delivery orders tonight and will not waive the delivery charge.  He was very rude on the phone.  For  small business to act this way is very disturbing especially since we order here frequently.  I'd say if it's a rainy night - don't order  delivery. Food came 1.5 hours late- not hot, but still like the chicken and broccoli and the eggs rolls (Cade's dinner) Cade's review - lots of broccoli - hardly any chicken $11 Harris Teeter has a good Asian bar - $7.99 a pound Looks like Harris Teeter will be on the list for Asian take out from now on"}
{"text":"They deliver in the Ballantyne area which is a plus because not many of the Chinese restaurants in this area do. Its family owned and the people are nice and inviting. The menu is typical Chinese fare. The General Tso's shrimp I had tonight was great."}
{"text":"Quick Chinese food always hits the spot, so you can't go wrong with this place.  Their delivery is super fast too.  I love what they do with broccoli.  Most places overcook it so it's very mushy, but theirs has the right amount of \"bite\" to it.  Good restaurant for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason it has one star is because it would not allow me to post without adding at least a star, it's horrible!!!!! If you want good customer service and good food please keep looking. I placed an order for delivery, my food was late and when it finally arrived it was horrible. Presentation is everything and this food looked as if the cook picked it off the floor. I called and someone said they were making me more and it would be out soon. After about 40 minutes I called and was told it would be another 30 minutes.... I know right, the lady and I went around and around on the phone before she hung up on me. I tried calling back and they would not answer the phone. I'm out of $30 and I have no dinner. You can eat here if you like but don't say you were not warned. I should've listened to the previous reviews myself but I didn't, look how things turned out. A TOUGH LEASON LEARNED......."}
{"text":"We are not big fans of Chinese take out or Chinese food for that matter. But, I am 7 months pregnant and I had a bit of a craving for Chinese and a bigger craving for NOT cooking. I had gotten a menu on my door a couple weeks back and I kept it in my kitchen just in case so today I decided to order some food. Ok, delivery was FAST! Like flash-fast. The delivery guy was so nice so thumbs up. Customer service, awesome! The lady that took my order was so kind. After I received the food I realized I made a mistake and instead of lo mein o ordered chow mein. So I had to call and they simply made me a new order of lo mein and sent it my way no questions asked. The delivery guy once again super nice. He told me to just keep the chow mein (Husband was happy lol). Now the food. A bit too greasy for my taste but good overall. I asked for A LOT of veggies in my lo mein and boy did I get A LOT of veggies! Awesome! My steamed dumplings were yummy. But I just found it to be overall kind of oily which turned me off a bit. Will I recommend Chef Kwo? Yes! Will I order again? Sure, if I ever crave Chinese again which very rarely I do. Thats my honest review."}
{"text":"So, it's been a while since I have been here, but it is just as nice as it was the first time.  The location is small, so if you have 4 or more guests it may be hard to all sit together.  Since, I do not have many friends, this does not seem to be a problem for me.  The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever experienced in a small establishment like this, and the service is quick.  I had the Chicken Kon Bo, and it was exactly as it should be, HOT, spicy, filled with chicken and peanuts.  The rice was good, and the eggs make all the difference in the world when it comes to the sticky rice.  The portion size was perfect  making this location back on my short list of food restaurants.  Excellent take out option, very reasonably priced.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in south Charlotte! I've found that the best Asian food comes from a small kitchen rather than a large sit-down chain like this one! Great Lo Mein and Kung Pao dishes!"}
{"text":"Chef Kwo is located in a little strip mall in the heart of Ballantyne.  I mostly get take out and it's usually the Chicken Fried Rice or the General Chicken.  Both are pretty yummy and lunch and dinner entree's can be had in the range of $6-$12.  The inside of the restaurant is small but its very clean and that's what counts IMO.  I really don't know if it's the food or the owners/employees that keep me coming back.  They are so friendly it's ridiculous....needless to say it's refreshing and I like it!    If you like service with a smile go ahead and stop into Chef Kwo!"}
{"text":"This is not a dry cleaning establishment!! It is a very yummy Chinese take-out spot I frequent with my coworkers during our lunch hour. Very friendly staff and super affordable! Lunch specials starting at 5.50 which includes rice/spring roll/ and your entree!"}
{"text":"My usual place turned all Vegetarian and my backup is closed on Tuesdays. It was open. Generals chicken was good, not super spicy. The steamed dumplings we're really good. The fried rice was just ok. Works in a pinch. They deliver and it was fast to walk up and order."}
{"text":"I had Chef Kwo today for lunch and was very satisfied.  The food tasted great, the portion for lunch was substantial, and the pricing was very reasonable.  If you work in the Ballantyne area, I would recommend going here."}
{"text":"Good spring rolls for $1.50 each. I just wish they came with a special dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is very good and the lunch prices are affordable. The lady who works the front desk is always nice."}
{"text":"The food was bland. And the place smelled like old mop water. Luckily we did take out because it was hot in there also."}
{"text":"Lived across from this place for a year now and just now tried it and boy am I glad we did. My husband just thanked me. It was that good. He said it's better than his favorite Great Wall of China South that he's been going to for 20 years. This is our new weekly Chinese restaurant!"}
