{"text":"Fell into this place totally by accident. 2 hour wait next door at Bar Raval. (See review) That's ok. This place rocked.   Very cool , laid back vibe. Amazing sound track playing. Waiter and bartender were absolutely the best. Don't see something on the drink list you like, no worries. Bartender while whip up something that will blow your mind.   Small, bar food menu from restaurant downstairs. Amazing. Dumpling were great,bao that tasted like a big mac. Awesome stuff."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing. The Big Mac Bao was very small and nothing special. There was a special on some form of fish taco but it had bones in it and was difficult to eat. We also ordered the platter which had a variety of items from the bar menu. The food was not very tasty. The only thing that was fairly decent was the truffle fried rice. This is definitely not authentic chinese food and is quite expensive for the quantity and quality.  The service was fine, they did take one of the fish taco off the bill as we advised them that we did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Came here for a cocktail and a bite after  watching Raymond on top chef. Ordered the chefs sample of appetizers which Included dumplings, foie grois and the coup de resistance, Fried trout ribs. Amazing that the kitchen could take something usually inedible and turn it into salty delicious bites. We came fairly early in the night and the place was quite quiet. Friendly staff and really above expectation food.  Recommended"}
{"text":"A great location for hanging out. Theirs plenty seating and space to stand around and chat. Their food and drink menu is unique. I got the boa that tasted like the big mac, but I think it was mostly in the sauce. Also got the drink pan the man which isn't too strong but quite a good drink to last you awhile. Over all atmosphere was great and the waiters were very attentive."}
{"text":"Small and secluded with very friendly staff. They had snack items which we did not try because we only came here for drinks, but glancing at the snack menu I knew they were tasty because I tried some of them downstairs at Dailo. I was surprised how empty it was on a Saturday night, good for us as we got seats in an instant, I guess people don't know to go upstairs? Great on a summer night with fierce air conditioning!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie- the place is nice- the drink menu is nice- the service is nice and the food looked nice as well...buuuuuutttt  we ordered the fried tofu , McBau , cod balls and duck wings.   The $7 spent for just one Bau that was the size of a tennis ball that is supposed to taste like a  $5.25 Mcdonalds sandwich just didn't make sense to me. Anything for the snap right?  It was good- but my mind was not blown. Actually is was barely impressed.  General Tso Crispy Confit Duck Wings was good bang for your buck and it actually tasted decent. The drumstick on the duck wing is the same size as a chickens leg drumstick. So it was a decent portion. The sauce and garnish was nice. Again this time i was satisfied- at best!  The disappointment of the night came with KFC Popcorn Tofu and it is probably why I could not enjoy the rest of my meals as much. SALT! biting into felt like I dove head first into the dead sea. Beer and other garnishes couldn't wash away the saltiness it left on my tongue. However, we did tell the server and they knocked it off the bill. Which was really great service  The cod balls were great and the drink menu was amazing. This place is a great place to hang out and have drinks and nibble. Maybe I went on an off night. Damn you Tofu!"}
{"text":"I've been here once with a friend in February. This place is quiet, clean, and intimate. If you want a place to chat quietly with a friend and catch up with a couple of drinks, this is the place to go. The interior looks like an nightclub with Asian decorative. The bill comes in a red envelope which is very adorable.  We got Katipunan and Haiku for cocktails. Nice and strong. I just wish we tried some of their food. Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely stopping by Lo Pan and try Dailo too."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and I can honestly say it's better than Dailo downstairs. We ordered the whole menu this time (sans the Chef's Platter) and everything was delicious.  Recommend the Tofu, fried rice, big mac bao, duck wings, fried baby sardines, can't remember the rest. The cocktails were expensive so we didn't get them. This time we went during the week and it was empty, but I've been on a Saturday night and it's packed with drunk people lol."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem. Very happy we did. Now we know where to go when we want an amazing drink and some equally amazing snacks when we are in the area. Or maybe even if we are not anywhere near the area. Because it would be worth a trip to the area. Know what I'm sayin'? The drinks on the menu all look interesting and worth a try. I went for a Princess Krona and it was pretty, pretty good. But if you don't see anything on the bar menu that catches your eye, the bartender will mix you up something special according to your own taste. Be prepared to be wowed.  Now onto the food. Well, Yelpsters, we only had two things: the Hakka brown wonton (pork & shrimp) and the famous Big Mac bao. Both were over the top. In fact, the bao was stupid. And I mean that in the best possible way. It captures the true essence of the Big Mac in the spirit of the bao. It's truly a taste experience. Yes it is 7 dollars. Just get it. You know you want one. I will gladly fork over another 7 bucks for one of those bad baos next time I'm here. I actually can't wait to go back and sink my teeth into some of that deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Holy hell those are some good bar snacks.  We stumbled up here around 1 am on a Saturday night and grabbed a couple spots at the bar. We laughed about the time back when this place was called \"Bird\" and Dave tripped up the last step and literally stumbled into the bar like a drunken idiot. Love you Dave!  Anyway, two beautifully balanced cocktails later, we found ourselves tucking into a supremely delicious collection of small Asian bites...various dumplings, shishito peppers, out-of-this-world bao that tasted just like a Big Mac...and everything hit the spot in a big way. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly Asian GM, nice decor and friendly workers. Food is always pretty consistent."}
{"text":"My group of 4 came here wile waiting for a table elsewhere. We had such an amazing experience, I'm sure I will be back for the full deal. Megan (?sp) the bartender gave amazing service. She Suggested great drinks. We tried 3 different ones from cocktail menu at $15 a pop and they were all worth it for sure. Sampler app item was 10/10 for deliciousness and the tofu item ordered by our token vegetarian was completely eaten. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"LoPan is the bar associated with Dai-Lo located upstairs above the restaurant. To note...  1. Excellent cocktails and service. 2. Blessedly uncrowded. If you are delayed as a drop-in to Dai-Lo, or are crowded out of Bar Raval next Door, Check it out. 3. Try the Asian corn dog. Even if you have reservations downstairs or elsewhere, make this an appetizer."}
{"text":"We ended up here by accident. We couldn't get into La Carnita next door because of the ridiculous 2-hour wait, and DaiLo was packed - but by chance and kismet, LoPan (DaiLo's second floor tapas-style snack bar) had a table available, so following the orders of our hungry stomachs,  despite knowing nothing about the restaurant, we took a chance and had dinner here instead. We're so glad we did - sometimes, go with your gut. Stumbling upon even a random snack bar can bring you a satisfying, memorable meal.  First, the parking situation is decent. A block east of the restaurant are several small side streets where you can find free parking. If you can't find any, a decent amount of street parking around the restaurant is available.   Second, the service. I just wanted to commend how wonderfully accommodating, professional, and friendly the staff were. They were aware of my shellfish allergy from the outset, and went out of their way to ensure that the Jellyfish Slaw salad wasn't \"shellfish\" and made sure I was able to eat it.   Third, the food. Keep in mind that the orders here are all snack-size, appetizer-style, so don't expect a full-sized meal. We ordered: a) the Jellyflish Slaw, b) Truffle Fried Rice, c) Big Mac Bao (1 piece), d) Korean BBQ short ribs, e) KFC popcorn tofu.   The Truffle Fried Rice and the Jellyfish Slaw were definitely the stand-outs - delicious flavours melding sweet and salty with the comforting feeling of chomping on fried rice, along with really interesting textures in the Jellyfish Slaw (it wasn't slimy, but super crunchy and delicious). I would pass on the Korean BBQ ribs (it's basically something you can make at home, and is really nothing special).  Overall, for portion size, the value isn't that great (I don't think $19 for the Truffle Fried Rice was warranted, given how small the portion was). But, regardless, the quality of the food is there, and it was a great meal.   For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $63."}
{"text":"Five stars for the DUCK WINGS! My boyfriend and I both agree that they truly one of the tastiest dishes we've ever had....ever. Not to mention the atmosphere and service is great."}
{"text":"We loved it here! We were waiting for our table at La Carnita and decided to have a drink & snack upstairs. Pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere it was cool, service was great and the food was exceptional. I had the Pork on a croissant, I would go back for it, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tasty bar snacks and decent cocktails but I have to make a comment in regards to manic service. Perhaps this is more a comment on Toronto-wide levels of customer service, but as LoPan is my most recent experience it serves as a symbolic microcosm of said overzealous practices.  So, I say it here: give customers time to drink and to talk! Stop worrying and fussing about plates left empty. It is okay for customers to wait. We want to wait! We want to drink and chat and snack and wipe the remnants from said \"empty\" plates with delight before they are swiftly moved away. Waiters, you are great, you're kind, you're perfunctory, you're handsome, you are ridiculously well-versed in wine et al....... but please take a chill pill and do a little less of a \"good job\" so that I can slow down, relax, and enjoy my night. Go to Paris or go to Berlin for lunch and you will see, good food doesn't require insanely breakneck service. Let's find a happy medium."}
{"text":"DaiLo's second floor snack bar definitely deserves its own Yelp space. The atmosphere, menu, and overall experience make LoPan firmly independent of big brother DaiLo despite what is a shared kitchen. I wandered in with a friend to grab a drink while waiting for a seat downstairs and never left. The service was very accommodating and attentive despite the fact that The Shangri-La was hosting a staff party at LoPan that night.   The bartender was a most personable and skilled fella who made some fantastic off the menu cocktails including one made on the spot we decided to name White Rabbit for the night. He also managed to get me hooked on Brooklyn(s) (the less famed but more delicious cousin of a Manhattan) and engaged us in conversation about growing up in Ireland.   The dim-sum style menu was also quite impressive and exceeded our expectations. The famed Big Mac Bao was every bit as good as the hype would suggest. Who really can resist a Big Mac baked into a bao?! My second favourite dish was the Asian confit duck wings with nut crumble. I love anything duck, but had never tried anything like this. Simple but absolutely delicious. The trout and KFC tofu were also delicious, as was the secret menu item you will have to find out about on your own ;) The only mid disappointment came from the Korean BBQ short ribs which were not as good as ones I have had in Markham restaurants, but the quality of service and other delectable food and drink offerings more than made up for it.   Overall, LoPan is bound to be one of my go to spots this year. You should also check it out."}
{"text":"LoPan has this nice Speakeasy vibe. It is located at the 2nd floor of DaiLo and actually is part of DaiLo as their bar snacks really come from the same kitchen.  We popped in for a pre dinner cocktail and even our friendly bartender was surprised to see us. He thought we came to the wrong bar? But when I walked into LoPan, I knew it is the perfect venue for a quick drink/snacks and just have a good time with friends.  Cocktails was well crafted and I do love the Asian twist on some of them. I love spicy cocktails and my Stockholm Knights in this cute Tiki mug really hit the spot.  I know I will be back next time when I am in Little Italy wondering where I should go for a drink......"}
{"text":"We had the entire second floor for a birthday celebration- all of the appetizers were amazing, all the food was excellent.....I don't know the names of everything we had but it was all good - I highly recommend this place...service was amazing, will definitely go back the next time I'm in Toronto"}
