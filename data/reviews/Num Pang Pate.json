{"text":"I really love their classic style Banh Mi sandwich.    The pate is really good, and has a great creamy texture.  The toppings are a perfect contrast to the crisp and flaky baguette, and provide that wonderful finish to each and every bite.  Fresh cucumber, cilantro, and the pickled onions and cabbage really go well with the mayo.  All in all, it's a sandwich that offers a whole lot of taste at a very reasonable cost.  For the same price as that greasy & oily McValue meal you can get one of these.  And you should!"}
{"text":"For some reason the banh mi does not have the following in Cleveland as it does in other places I have been. In Pittsburgh it has been named the best sandwich. Take that Primanti lady! I have found many choices of banh mi in Vegas, Columbus and Tampa. Here not so much. We have ready made sandwiches at the Asian grocery stores but they are made with head cheese, and I am not fond of headcheese.   Superior Pho makes a good sandwich but only offers pork. Thus I was delighted to find Num Pang Pate's wide selection of sandwiches. Each I have had has been excellent. I love the bread, the meat, the pickled radish and carrots, cilantro and cucumber combination. It usually surprises me that on the way to this tiny place in the Colonial Arcade Marketplace I pass long lines waiting for sandwiches at Quizno and Jimmy John. I have been to both once. I have been to Num Pang Pate many times.   Yesterday, I tried the pork salad with homemade sauce. At first I saw slices of some processed lunch meat and thought I made a poor choice. But I loved the salty, sweet, sour taste of this many textured salad that did include slices of roast pork. The Indochinese are talented in creating combinations fusing Chinese, French and American influences but uniquely their own."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place and I agree with the others, it's an awesome place.  I tried the classic because they were out of BBQ pork and it was very flavorful and delicious.  They definitely don't skimp on the condiments with plenty of pickled cabbage and carrots and parsley.  They have a pretty wide range of sandwich choices for an excellent price.  The bread was traditional french bread toasted so it's nice and crisp. The only few minor complaints would be that the mayo wasn't homemade (it really makes a difference on bahn-mi sandwiches) and I prefer pickled jicama to the pickled cabbage.  The bread did tend to get a little soggy towards the end.   However, those definitely weren't big enough complaints to stop me from coming back."}
