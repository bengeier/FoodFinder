{"text":"Neat little gathering of stores. Nothing that caught my fancy, but surely it has potential. It's one of those little green shrubs popping around Cleveland that show the city's renewal.  But it's just not that interesting. Yet."}
{"text":"I love the effort to revive historic buildings into useful space. You will find here: Flap Jacks, Vincenza's Pizza, Colossal Cupcakes, Pour, a bow tie shop and a kilt store, yes kilts. What's lacking and what this needs is a bagpipe store."}
{"text":"I love this place, stroll the walkway and be a tourist in your own city! Grab a bite to eat and check you email or just people watch.(I am a closet sociologist so I LOVE to do that!)  Just a fantastic place to hang out. Very eclectic and interesting, there is certainly something that will catch your eye so go have some fun and pretend to be from out of town!!! Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty inside. Not too much going on there except Colossal Cupcakes.  There is an Italian place there that is not bad. Just not much to this place."}
{"text":"I came in here to walk around, and as it's quite small, there's not too much to do nor see. Lots of interesting shops here to browse, but for whatever reason they were all closed on a Saturday afternoon. We just walked around for a bit, window looking."}
{"text":"Neat gathering of stores. They have a range of places to suite your fancy, from a tea store (The Tea Lab) to coffee (Pour) to cupcakes. They also have a barber shop and some other non-food places.  It seemed pretty empty when we visited over the weekend."}
{"text":"So when I think arcades I'm not thinking shopping and food. There were a few neat stores and almost art type galleries, and then mixed in were some cafes and food options. Very popular it seemed with the business folks working downtown. Many people getting their lunches and having casual conversations. It's a nice gathering place."}
{"text":"Amazing event! We got VIP for $35 each and it was worth it! We got a great Cleveland Scene glass for our 6 drink tickets and all you can eat food from all the restaurants! And no worries about running out of tickets a lot of places were giving out free alcohol as well! Tropical Twist fruit juice and vodka was favorite drink of the day and the chicken and waffles from The Market was amazing! Definitely will be making this a yearly event if they do it again next year!"}
{"text":"This place seems like somewhere that has a ton of potential. Its an indoor walkway that extends all of the across the block, making it an entertaining way to cross from one street to another. Its pretty and clean and lined with random little shops. However, at least as of now, many of the store fronts were uninhabited. Oddest of all, when we walked through on a Saturday afternoon, the place was dead. Nobody was in here but us and only a few stores were even open. Quite odd given the time of day and that everywhere in the surrounding area were quite active."}
