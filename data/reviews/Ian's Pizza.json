{"text":"Ian's can't be beat, as far as I'm concerned, when it comes to by-the-slice pizza.

With a broad selection of classic and unconventional flavors, there's something for everyone. Mac and Cheese is great for kids, but I tend to go for something with a bit more flavor. They recently started offering breadsticks too, which are pretty delicious-- crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and well-seasoned. The pizza and breadsticks are put into the oven when you order to warm and crisp them, and pulled out for you just a few minutes later. I highly recommend eating Ian's this way, instead of ordering a whole pizza for delivery.

They also make a ridiculously addicting Caesar Salad (sub chicken for the egg). Their salad line in general is pretty great. Loads of fresh, local ingredients and house-made dressings (they even ask you if you'd prefer light, medium, or heavy on the dressing), spun right before your eyes.

The staff are always very friendly and they have great taste in music!"}
{"text":"Bringing me back to college days, this is exactly like my favorite drunk food pizza place. We didn't feel like eating out during a storm so we ordered a large BBQ brisket with tater tots pizza for pickup. Man, this thing was huge. Absolutely no reason for just two people to order a large. But it was definitely a good pizza, though the BBQ sauce was a little too powerful in my opinion. But you can't go wrong with tater tots on pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good.  They have a lot of nice flavor combos and the ingredient quality seems pretty good.  I've heard people complain about $3.50 for a slice, but I don't think it's really all that much.  Especially when 1 maybe 2 slices will fill you up nicely.  I eat here when I find myself in the area so I absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped over in Madison for the evening and needed a late night meal delivered to the hotel. Their old school pizza special is fantastic value and the food was wonderful. Added on a family size Caesar salad and was very happy with the quality. Excellent value, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Ian's on State Street is a great place to get a slice, or two. I have to admit that I haven't had the \"full\" Ian's experience - haven't been there around bar closing time, or ordered a whole pizza, or visited the Ian's on Frances - but I still think overall their pizza is as good as anyone else's in Madison. They get a lot of attention for the mac and cheese pizza, and rightfully so: it's phenomenal. The crust on their pizza is also better than you'll find in most places.
  Ignore the few Ian's haters mixed in here and give this place a try sometime when you're wandering around State St. or the Capitol. Chances are you'll go back ..."}
{"text":"Smart set up for quick service. Hip vibe. Funky takes on topping options. But at the end of the day, just solid Jersey-style crust. Love it!"}
{"text":"Tried the Mac n' Cheese, Smokey the Bandit and Cheesy Potato with Ranch. They taste amazing as always, especially the crust. But I'm not a huge fan of the Mac n' Cheese. The different components were excellent but I think they simple don't go well together. I gave it a try since it's the best seller. I like Cheesy Potato with Ranch best among the 3.
Ian's has a lot of crazy different toppings but I think they taste better on their own instead of as pizza toppings. I prefer the old school and classic options more."}
{"text":"I went to Madison for the first time this weekend, and of course the boy brought me to Ian's to try the mac and cheese pizza. I admit, I was skeptical - I mean, macaroni and cheese on a pizza??? But it was my favorite food of the weekend (and there were a lot of great foods!). No tomato sauce, just lots of cheese (we think ricotta on the bottom, then the mac and cheese, and melted cheddar on the top) and deliciousness. I heard they're opening an Ian's in Chicago, and when they do, I will be first in line for mac and cheese pizza on their opening day!"}
{"text":"2 experiences here this weekend. Both were delicious and affordable. Plus great funkschway (spell check)."}
{"text":"Classic MAC and CHEESE pizza!! There is no way you can miss this being in Wisconsin, where cheese is king ~~ The other pizzas they make are good too, but I just can't say enough about their mac and cheese pizza. One day when I leave town, this will be one of the classics that I will certainly miss, no doubt. 

I love how Ian's has their pizza is a slice or as a whole. So if you find yourself craving pizza and you can't find 10 other people to share with you, or if your friends have very distinct preferences for pizza toppings, you can just each get your own slice and still hang out together."}
{"text":"Completely perfect! The crust is just the right kind of crispy, service is always friendly and charming, would go here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Meh. I thought this place was overrated. I am from Chicago, so naturally, I am a pizza snob. I tried the infamous mac and cheese pizza, and it was SO boring. The mac and cheese pizza I had the night before at the Great Dane was spectacular. I will admit, that I do like that you can order a slice, and it is a huge slice for only 3.50. Perhaps, next time I will go with what sounds good to me and not what is most popular..."}
{"text":"Great food! Different taste of pizza. I had a west style salad and slice of Mac an cheese pizza for $9.00. It was very filling food. Pizza slice is big."}
{"text":"Creative toppings presented for your eating pleasure from Outside of the Box. Ian's Pizza by the Slice offers your standard toppings, but, the real highlight here is the toppings that aren't usually found on a pizza.

Mac and cheese - sure thing. Penne with marinara - absolutely. Quesadilla - bring it. Italian Beef Sandwich - good to go! Ian's offers unique flavors in a familiar format that everyone can love.

The staff is friendly and accommodating. You want something on your pizza that isn't there already? Sure, they'll put it on for you.

The atmosphere is a little confusing. It's like the late 90s met with a group of college kids low on cash who just threw a bunch of left overs on a crust, who then found a bunch of teenagers to pass it off to. Two nights in a row my group (mid twenties/early thirties) seemed out of place and much too old for the establishment. 

Apparently on Thursday nights if you hang around long enough there is a local band.

By the way, if you go, get the Sprecher's Cream Soda."}
{"text":"Great selection, great service: fast and friendly.

Also open for breakfast pizza during Farmer's Market season: biscuits and gravy pizza, you have to try it."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan pizzas! But I would recommend Ian's to anybody, meat eater or non.

I like the atmosphere, and that they're open until 2 or 3 am on weekends. I love the portabella mushrooms, artichokes, spinach, vegan \"mozzarella\" & \"pepperoni\"!  It's great that most of the veggies are sourced locally and are seasonal/fresh. (Probably the meat and cheese is too? Idk)

Whether you get the dairy-based or non-dairy version, you really should try the mac&cheese pizza. I didn't think it sounded good at first either. I was wrong!

I think that like most other places they do jack up the prices for the vegan options, but that is kind of to be expected. Seems like otherwise Ian's prices are pretty good compared to say Glass Nickel or something. My roommate orders Ian's pepperoni and cheese pies all the time because they're apparently cheap and awesome.

My only real problem is that on Mondays, when they advertise that they have vegan pizza available by the slice during certain hours, they often do not have any at all. And sometimes they'll make one when you point out the fact that it's Monday, but it takes forever and kind of defeats the purpose. Then other times they will just tell you that they'll only make a vegan pie if you intend to buy the pie... That's not cool. Why do you advertise this thing if you're going to tell me you're not going to do that thing?

One other thing, they have repeatedly forgotten my drinks when I got delivery and ordered sodas! So if you order online I would seriously recommend calling them up and reminding them that you ordered a drink, or just don't bother. To be fair though, last time it happened I finally complained to the delivery guy and they gave me a $5 credit for my next order, as well as making a return trip to bring the drinks. So they did make good."}
{"text":"Just can't get enough of this place! I love that everytime I go, I always have a different slice. Never repeated yet! Love the flavor combo's! Ian's Fan for life!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the state basketball championship and had heard good things about Ian's pizza, so I decided to try it. The first slice of pizza I had was the sriracha chicken and it was disturbingly bland for a supposedly spicy piece of pizza. The second slice I had was the bbq pulled pork. This slice did have a taste, but it was not of bbq or pulled pork. The environment was loud and very busy. Overall it was not worth the $4 per slice and the wait."}
{"text":"Ian's delivery is a complete mess as you have arrogant college students deliberately ducking phone calls and rudely avoiding delivery.  Stay away until they get a handle on their irritable college student staff."}
{"text":"For those who seek irregular and adventurous pie concoctions this is the place to go.  Always with an array of choices Ian's will cater to those seeking something basic and those looking to pile as much potato, green onions, barbecue sauce, and bacon on as possible. 

A bit better value than area rival Casa de Roma, and feeling design-decor cleaner as well as sanitary cleaner, the pizza to pizza comparison seems Ian's is a bit heavier filling and more exotic whereas Casa de Roma is more New Yorkesque whose specialties extend to safer choices like spinach and feta.  I suppose, if the latter is your preference than it should be your destination.  But, for those looking to pile it on and enjoy the flavors and variety Ian's dominates.

My one complaint would be the State Street location could use more tables in the secondary room as there is much wasted space in the center of the room and the place is frequently full during lunches and late nights.

Side note: For added complimentary value they now have available bottles of ranch, bbq, and hot sauce for all your dipping needs.  And fyi they offer a 20 inch monster cheese pie on weekend late nights for only 10 dollars!  It just keeps getting better and better."}
{"text":"It's been two hours since I ordered my pizza for delivery.  It is still not here.  It's overdue by an hour; I've called twice.  The man on the phone is nice and I'm sure everyone is trying hard, but I regret my order and sincerely believe a delivery service, especially in a town this size, can be done better.  The last explanation was traffic.  It's Madison."}
{"text":"We ordered from them once, and it will probably be the one and only time. The pizza was super thin, with barely any cheese, and super soggy and greasy. But that could have at least been tolerated, because it tasted great.  

The biggest problem was that it took 1:15 to get to us. We ordered through Yelp, and the estimated time was 45 mins-- o.k. At one hour, it hadn't arrived, so I called to inquire about our pizza. The guy said something irrelevant about how often THEY check thier tablets and apps, (ok, bud, that's nice), and then blamed me, saying \"Well, you shouldn't order on the app anyways, it's faster to just call.\" So, if the app is unreliable, then why do you have that option? And why is this my fault?? Anyway, they were nice enough, but we ended up sitting around waiting for way too long and getting blamed for it. Yikes."}
{"text":"Great for a quick slice for lunch during the work day or for a late-night, post-bar snack."}
{"text":"While I love Ian's pizza, the price seems to be getting out of control. 
Was in Madison today and picked up a slice of Pepperoni and sausage, it was $4. That is a bit to high in my mind."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service and general organization of this location is severely lacking. Twice now I've received the wrong pick-up order. In order to rectify those mistakes, I was given a credit, but it took a solid 30 mins to explain this to the employees working so that they could find the credit and actually apply it. What a pain in the a**."}
{"text":"Wisconsin is not really a great place for pizza, but this place is fine. Try the mac n cheese slice for the sake of novelty."}
{"text":"If you're craving Italian flavors, don't bother with Ian's.  After all, when will the novelty of mac-and-cheese pizza wear off and people realize that the stuff is just as bland on a crust as it is out of the box and in your bowl?  And Chicago hot dog pizza?  Really?  The vast majority of other offerings involve either steak or chicken; if I was in the mood for such, I'd hunt down a Mexican joint and enjoy my meal 10X more.

The store on State has become much more disorganized in the last two years, as well.  At my last visit, the counter kid stared at me for a couple of seconds (as if it was MY job to welcome him)--and then, instead of asking for my order, he continued to fondle two empty paper plates in his hands like they were a coed's breasts.  I couldn't tell if he was obscene, clueless, or just plain rude.  The visit before that, the cashier abandoned me before I could pay, in order to spend 10 making a salad for and flirting with a giggling ditz.  I guess this is what happens when you hire hormonal children to run your shop.

If you want a tasty pizza with a New York-style crust and traditional flavors, I recommend getting delivery from Supreme Pizza on East Johnson.  Supreme can also make custom slices for walk-ins in the same time it takes Ian's to reheat a slice from their display counter (and after all, how long has that mustard-streaked hot dog pizza been sitting out?)."}
{"text":"Tonight a friend and i ordered several pizzas. When they arrived one of the pizzas was wrong. When we ordered them the guy on the phone messed up the order in the computer.

We called and spoke to a manager. The manager immediately sent over a large replacement pizza (we had originally ordered a small). He then called later to make sure the new pizza was correct and gave me a $10 credit on our next order.

Not only is their pizza amazing, but their customer service is exemplary. Both the manager and the delivery guy were friendly and a pleasure to work with. 

I am very impressed with their organization. I can't recommend them highly enough. Order the Smokey and the Bandit!"}
{"text":"I love Ian's! It's such a Madison staple; I always have to stop by when I'm visiting family in WI. Ian's has such a fun variety...everything from mac 'n cheese pizza to baked potato pizza to salad pizza. Yes, salad pizza. I'm personally a big fan of the buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, but I like to try something new every time. So far, not a single experiment has gone poorly for me. 
The atmosphere feels very much like a college campus. It can be crowded, noisy, and full of students. Depending on when you go (such as lunchtime), the line can get very long, but the service is fast and friendly so the wait is manageable. I highly recommend a trip next time you're on State Street."}
{"text":"The most perfect pizza crust I've ever eaten....perfectly crispy on the bottom with also being just soft enough on top :) toppings were really delicious too. Atmosphere was fun and workers were great."}
{"text":"Although they have a selection of specialty pizzas none of them match up to some of the other pizza places in Madison (Glass Nickel, Roman Candle, Pizza Di Roma, Falbo's). If you are looking for something way out of the ordinary it may suffice, but Falbo's definitely makes a better specialty pizza.

On the other hand Ian's makes great salads. They have a huge variety of toppings you can add and are good either for their or take-away. I would recommend their salads far before I recommended their pizza."}
{"text":"I feel totally confident giving Ian's 5 stars since I have eaten there when I was sober - seriously.  I never had a bad bite there - and there is great people watching after bar time, of course.  I've never had delivery, but it's always a good time in there.  Gotta have that mac 'n cheese slice!"}
{"text":"Almost 5. Food is always good. Place isn't clean enough to give it a 5. Tables need to be wiped more regularly.   Especially on the weekends when the place has tons of traffic. The mac and cheese pizza is always a family favorite!  Salads are always fresh and can be customized."}
{"text":"Ordering: there's no pizza menu except the pamphlet at the cashier which is annoying. The 'by the slice'  pizzas have no labels either. 

Eating: the pizzas are pretty crap. Maybe if I was drunk I wouldn't notice that it's just flavourless grease bread, but alas, I couldn't eat more than one slice. A frozen pizza from the grocery store would be of roughly equal quality. 
... Or maybe I'd like it if I was a hipster who ironically ate disgusting pizzas to prove a point? I don't know, but I won't eat here again (we gave them three tries)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I love this place to bits! Every time I find myself downtown, I always come up with an excuse or a reason why we should visit Ian's in the wee hours of the morning. You HAVE to try the mac and cheese pizza - it's the best of both worlds. The prices are insanely good too, and the employees and the atmosphere is laid back and fun."}
{"text":"100% the best place to grab a quick yummy bite when on State. They always have interesting and delicious options! I always get something I think is weird because 90% of the time I end up loving it!"}
{"text":"Gotta love it. Floppy pieces of pizza. The large pepperoni or cheese pizza is a great deal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take the kids. There are lots of choices of their pizza by the slice, so everyone can get what they want. I love the salad bar where you can pick what you want in veggies, cheeses and meats. They have both fresh young greens and romaine lettuce.  A little loud for me so I go for take out, but kids love it."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. If you have never tried Ian's, you gotta! This is my favorite pizza / most fun pizza. Was just there again a few weeks ago and I love the variety. I've never had a bad slice even on stuff I thought was weird like mac n cheese pizza. Big slice - low price."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hoopla is about this pizza, it all tastes bland to me. Doesn't matter if you get the mac and cheese pie or a roasted red pepper and feta pie, the crust is so bland and the sauce/cheese lacks any flavor at all.


Salad bar is 5 stars btw"}
{"text":"You've come a long way Wisconsin! It wasn't too long ago that if I asked for a pizza without cheese I would get some very strange looks! Enter Ian's Pizza; while well known for crazy combinations like mac and cheese or cheeseburger pizzas, Ian's will also hook you up with a vegan version. Yes, you heard me right vegan pizza it is a thing! Vegan night is on Monday but you can go in any night of the week and they'll whip up a vegan pie for you. You'll have to wait but it is definitely worth the wait! Thank you Ian's for making this vegan's pizza dreams come true!"}
{"text":"Visited on a recent visit to Madison.  Some of the best pizza ever.  Some odd combinations but soooo good.  Mac n cheese pizza is the bomb."}
{"text":"best mac and cheese pizza in the universe ! i always get the special and it is outstanding. creative food"}
{"text":"Very busy and happening place where a lot of college students congregate. 

The specialty pizza selection was very good and interesting. The individual salad was huge - we got the southwestern. So big husband and I shared it. 

Overall, great place for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza to eat a long night of drinks!! Sort of spendy for what you get but still delicious. The sausages are real sliced sausages links. VERY GOOD!!"}
{"text":"I love Ian's Pizza.  I am a vegetarian, and they always have many options from which to choose.  Even with the options, I keep coming back to the cheese slice.  Cover it in hot sauce and you have an addictive combination.  

Some people can be a little \"meh\" on the mac and cheese pizza, which I understand.  It is carbs on carbs with cream sauce.  However, I still love a warm slice with a little hot sauce.

The real unsung hero of Ian's is the salad bar.  Delicious ingredients made your way.  I do have to say, though, that the low-fat dressing selection can be a bit limited. 

Its cheap, big, original, and not greasy.  What more could you ask for?  

Service can range from rockstar to lame.  You order at the counter, so it isn't that important.

The atmosphere is casual.  The restaurant has always been remarkably clean for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a brisket and tots pizza. Ians called to tell me that they were out of brisket and asked if there was another pizza I'd like instead. I explained that I had never eaten there before and they were very helpful with giving me suggestions. I told him that I'd had a rough day so I was just going to go with pepperoni because I was too tired to decide on another adventurous pizza flavor

My pizza turned up on time and with a free bag of puppy chow. Not only that but when I got inside and opened it up I found that they had made more brisket and brought me the original pizza that I had wanted. That's great customer service, and on a day when I really needed one good thing to happen! Thanks guys! The pizza was great by the way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Crappy pizza, poor preparation, lousy ingredients.  Would you feed this junk to your kids? I think not."}
{"text":"The pizza here is OK.  Here's the problem- your ordering system sucks!!!!!!!  Every time I call to order a pizza that isn't one of your specialty pies, there's an issue.  For example, let's say I want to order a pizza with sausage and peppers.  The person on the phone will say something like, \"OK, so you want the \"Chicago Style\" but without onions (this is just a pretend example).  And I say, \"Well, I don't know- I just want a pizza with sausage and peppers.  And they'll, say, \"Yep, got it.\"  And it's wrong every time!!!!!  You need to make your computer ordering system easier for your employees to navigate.  Or up your training.  I've stopped ordering here due to this issue."}
{"text":"We were at a Madison home this past Sunday afternoon and the hosts ordered delivered pizza.  The pizza arrived warm and the driver appeared friendly.  Just a guess but the experience of Sarah S. may have occurred because the month was February.  Something to consider when reading this in November to April.

Much to my surprise, the pizza was pretty good.  You may well ask why the surprise of good pizza in a college town.  My response is I've never had good pizza in Madison over the 2+ decades I've visited here.  Some of the pizza has been ok as from the semi-national chain Rosati's and some has been downright awful like from big-nosed guy.  Anyway, the pizza was good enough to ask its source.  Ian's, incidentally, has locations in Milwaukee and Denver as well.

The delivered pies were plain cheese which was pretty good, one was buffalo chicken which some thought quite spicy although I didn't and one pie was banana pepper, black olive, mushroom and onion.  The last combination would never have occurred to me but was the best of the lot.  BTW, the buffalo chicken didn't have either cream or bleu cheese which are listed on the menu.

The star of the \"event\" was the perimeter crust.  The crust around the bottom was not at all crispy resulting in floppy wedges.  Not quite a classic New York crust but sufficiently tasty and crispy to rate 4 stars for all pies.  One caveat, as the event continued, the now cold pizza was not great with the plain cheese becoming the least edible.  The cheese became sort of mealy and the perimeter crust became soggy.

Regardless of the negatives listed above I'd go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Disappointing... we arrived around 5:15pm on a Sunday night. The restaurant was not even half full. Being our first time at this restaurant, we had to ask for help... do we just sit at a table? do we order at the counter? can someone help us?

We decided to order a whole pizza. While we waited, we read their menu and found they buy fresh, local ingredients. Nice! :)

After our first few bites, we realized the pepperoni was missing. We took our pizza up to the counter. The manager apologized and took our pizza. When he came back to our table about 10 minutes later, he brought our original pizza back... basically all he did was add pepperoni and a little more cheese, and popped it into the oven for a bit. Really??

Overall, not a good experience. Dirty table, empty silverware containers, and about half of the fountain soda flavors were out of order. The food was pretty cheap though (about $15 for 12\" pizza, breadsticks and 2 sodas)... good option for college kids!"}
{"text":"They make smoked brisket and tater tots pizza. I repeat, they make smoked brisket and tater tots pizza. Amazing.

It's also become something of a bi-weekly tradition for me and my boyfriend to try one of their weekly/monthly specials, and we have yet to be let down. I wish they would just put their thanksgiving pizza (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc) on their regular menu, because it's the most comforting, satisfying thing ever."}
{"text":"When you come by it is order by the slice. They have several pizzas out, you select what looks good, and then they throw it in the oven for a couple minutes to quickly reheat it (the pizzas don't sit out for long as they get pretty consistent traffic. Don't think you'll be eating pizza from several hours ago).

I think the greatest draw of this place is the unique offering on the pizza tops. One of my favorites has been the reuben pizza. 

Whenever your in Madison, this is definitely a place worthy of swinging by just for the experience. This may not be the best pizza ever but it is good and it may be the most unique pizza you've eaten. Either way you won't regret your visit. Both locations are equal in my experience so just to whichever is most convenient.

Also people say the max and cheese is best... don't believe it. Go for something else, I've found that one to be a little bland for my taste."}
{"text":"This place always provided my dinner when I bartended downtown, because I knew my meager tips earned by the early evening would be enough for a couple of great slices of pizza. Everyone has their own favorite specialty slices, but i tried to mix it up as often as possible to prevent pizza boredom. I was never disappointed. I'm glad they expanded to the neighboring storefront. Waiting for seating took longer than waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! 
Wait times can be long, but it's worth it. Friendly staff and great options other than delicious pizza. Love the location and restaurant set-up."}
{"text":"Loved this place. This is our second time here , we visited this place a year ago and had to come back.

Things we liked: 
Lots of variety in pizzas 
Friendly staff 
Prompt service
Delicious food 
Appropriate price per food ratio

Thing that weren't so great:
No directions or signs describing each type of pizza
Felt rushed
No beer service 

Because of the above we gave them four starz."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the various options for pizza toppings available at Ian's, creative toppings don't guarantee good pizza.  You know a pizza place is good when the plain cheese pizza is mouth-watering - and this is not the case at Ian's pizza.  The dough is a bit airy and a plain cheese slice is... plain."}
{"text":"I was told by a local that I had to try Ian's.  After reading the Yelp reviews I kept reading about the mac-n-cheese pizza.  Well, when in Rome right?  It was good.  I also had the chicken salad pizza, which I really liked.  The crust was light, crispy, and bit chewy as is proper.  I know that some people object to reheating slices, but truly, how else can a restaurant serve a high volume of pizza by the slice?

Why the four stars you ask?  Well, for the next 3 days I couldn't shake the macaroni pizza.  I kept telling my friends about it.  No joke, I was dreaming about it.  I wasn't satisfied with my other lunch and dinner meals as they weren't the macaroni pizza I was craving.  Yeah that's right, craving.  So, I drove out of my way enroute to the airport to get a slice.  OMG, it was better than I remembered!  The noodles were not dried out and crunchy as I feared, the delicious local cheese was glorious, just glorious.  I also had the Chicago dog pizza which I loved.  The hot peppers were so tasty and I loved the fact that they actually had authentic neon green relish too.

Weird combinations, yet, I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Omg all i have to say is get the mac n' cheese pizza. (Mic just dropped)"}
{"text":"Ian's is not good pizza. Putting macaroni and cheese on pizza is unnatural.  My husband will occasionally stop on the walk home from a night out to get a slice.  I often take one bite and wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"Traveling for work. First time in Madison. Checked in around 9:30 pm so I decided to have Ian's deliver.  I was not disappointed. Ordered a slice of Pep, Mac n Cheese and breadsticks. Delicious, Super friendly and fast delivery. Will definitely order every time I find myself in Madison."}
{"text":"Crispy crust!

We were on our way to Chicago for the weekend and I got the brilliant idea, \"hey, I'm addicted to TV food shows, we need to check out Ian's.\"  We were in Madison for a concert last spring, but we were in no shape to be visiting Ian's that night, so this was my opportunity.

I knew right where it was, but with the Occupy protests (or maybe it was just a regular protest, I have no idea which) and the heavy traffic around the lunch hour, we ended up driving around and finally parked in a ramp.  My travel companion was irritated, so I just kept my mouth shut.

We walked in and I just couldn't wait to see what I was going to have.   The conversation went like these -

Travel Companion, \"how many slices are you going to have.\"

Me, \"they are big, just 1.  What about you?\"

TC, \"not sure.\"

I ordered 1 slice of the tomato pesto and 1 slice of the Florentine.

TC, \"I thought you were only getting 1?\"

Me, \"They all looked good, so I couldn't decide.\" 

The ordering system was interesting, 4 orders or so, and then a break for the cooking of the pizza, the 4 more.  I didn't get it at first, but then while I was the first person in group 2 waiting for my food, I appreciated the fact I didn't wait long at all.

Travel companion had a Philly cheese steak and a BBQ bacon chicken.

Sat down at one of the only empty tables and took a big bite.  Mmm, that is crispy crust!    As I was plowing through both slices I couldn't decide which I preferred.  After the fact, I think it was the Florentine.  I liked the bite of the feta with the tasty tomatoes.

I'm not a Badger, but I've had some fun in Madison and this was a great place for a quick tasty and affordable lunch.  4 slices of pizza, 1 can of Diet Mountain Dew and an hour of parking only ran me $16."}
{"text":"I am one of the few who doesn't like the mac & cheese pizza. I appreciate the creativity, but I just think they're better apart. 
   I am a major fan of all the classical pizzas though. Pepperoni, cheese, sausage...I'll try a specialty slice once in awhile, but my go-to is certainly pepperoni. The crust of all the pies tastes the same as the breadsticks, For a side, I would highly recommend the breadsticks, which are huge, well seasoned, and filling. The drink options are plentiful, with drinks in the cooler (Izzes, Sun Drop, Sprite, etc.), and fountain soda
   The space is beautiful. It used to be the Children's Museum, and Ian's kept a lot of the wall gild designs. It reminds me of my childhood."}
{"text":"The experience at Ian's Pizza is largely mediocre. Unless you're a drunk college student looking to satisfy a late night craving with a slice, it's not really worth going there. I went there tonight with my boyfriend and we ordered a 12\" pie with some \"stix\" on the side. We received the stix promptly, and they were alright. But almost 45 minutes after that, we still had not received our pizza. I went over to check if it would be ready soon, but it turned out that they hadn't even started it yet (somehow the cook never got the order). The cashier was very apologetic and offered us a refund on the pizza while they quickly made it, which is why I'm giving them two stars instead of one. The pizza itself is certainly not worthy of any praise and was definitely not worth the wait in the end."}
{"text":"Love the Mac n Cheese Pizza-- all of their food is great!"}
{"text":"Not sure what there is to enjoy with this pizza.   Bland sauce, dry crust, horrible sausage.  Wish I would have had a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"I was a reluctant convert to Ian's.  Cirazy pizzas are not my thing- give me hot, fresh, and yummy any day. Their feta, spinach and tomato pizza is very good, and the rest of my family has their favorites. However, it's their Chicken Caesar salad that puts them above the rest in my book.  I've eaten this salad at dozens of places, and Ian's is among the best. Try it, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I always try something different each time I stop in. My favorites are the Buffalo Chicken, Smokey and the Bandit, and Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo Pizza."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place, and you know what? It's easy to see why. I've had four different slices, and they've all been amazing. I'm not even going to name all of them cause I'm pretty sure you can't miss here! Super fluffy crust and a huge variety of toppings"}
{"text":"I really like this place! They have salad, pizza & breadsticks. I was not disappointed! I ordered a speciality pizza with sweet potatoes, chorizo and a spicy sauce. $3.75 a slice. All I can say is mmmmmmmm! Yep I know it sounds weird but it was so good! They must have had over 10 different pizzas to choose from. They have basic pepperoni if you wanna be plain Jane. I also got breadsticks. They were good typical breadsticks. 

After talking with the friendly staff I learned they make up a different kinds of pizzas and see how they turn out. The salads are made fresh. You can buy a special salad ($6)or make ur own starting at $2.50 and you build up from there. If you need a carryout box just grab it they keep it on the counter not hidden in the back!

Wish I would've got a pic. I was hungry & intrigued so I gobbled it up fast! Sorry maybe next time"}

I usually enjoy getting Ian's salads for lunch. It's close to my office and the food quality is pretty decent. However, around lunchtime, the restaurant is mobbed. To navigate that, I have been trying to use their online ordering service. Epic fail.

First, Ian's doesn't know how to handle customers who have already ordered and paid online. There's no separate line for those orders to be fulfilled. Instead, you have to jump to the front of the line at the register that typically wraps all the way around to the door. That creates a very awkward position for the customer to be in. Online customers basically have to give the impression of being rude by cutting in front of the next customer in line. THEN, the system doesn't seem to tell the employee at the register whether or not the customer has paid. It ALSO doesn't tell them where the order originated from -- you are then asked what service you used to make the order (FourSquare, ChowHound,etc). I ordered through your website -- so whatever THAT is, is where it came from. If your system doesn't tell you that, your system sucks.

Even if you want to order a salad and wait in line -- it's a mess. Your salad usually ends up waiting for you as you wait in line for the multitude of pizza customers. This makes no sense. Invest in a register for the salad station and a tablet for the online orders to be picked up. 

Streamline that process. If you don't, you are defeating the purpose of online ordering.

Frustrated....

EDIT (2/22/2017):

Yeah -- this is STILL a mess. Ordered another chicken caesar salad online. Still, there is no separate line for orders that were placed through ChowNow. Again, the cashier had no idea that I had already paid. After explaining to him that I paid online, I asked him why Ian's can't get the online ordering figured out when Subway can. He asked \"why the hell would you go to Subway?\" Ummm....because THEY HAVE THE ONLINE ORDERS FIGURED OUT. Duh. When I got the salad back to my desk, I discovered that there was no chicken in it. 

Thanks for wasting my entire lunch break with your disorganization and complete disregard for the customer experience. This is the last time I will eat here. This is OBVIOUSLY aimed at drunk college kids who don't care. Downgrading to one star."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say this is necessarily the best pizza I've ever had but their originality certainly makes up for any faults it might have.  Mac & cheese pizza, chicken alfredo, barbecue steak and french fries (which I haven't tried) and more crazy stuff, it might sound odd but surprisingly most of it works.  And for the less adventurous they have plenty of standard pepperoni and cheese type fare as well.  Definitely a fun place to go after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Strange and different pizza!

It's really good stuff, and unique crazy pizza ideas, which I LOVE!

The pizza is so-so otherwise. Sometimes it can be a little over cooked (when it's sitting out for a bit, and they take it and toss it in the oven for a minute to warm it up.) But otherwise, cool cool.

I eat there, and have recommended visitors to give it a try. The newer one up by the capital is a better environment all in all."}
{"text":"This is a Madison institution and has been a late night pubbing tradition of ours for a decade. Mac N Cheese and Buffalo Chicken forever!!"}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizzas. Pick your flavor by the slice, many to choose from. 

The clearly famous one is the Mac and cheese pizza, the elbow macaroni noodles somehow stay tender and evenly covered in the white sauce and cheese. 

The spinach pizza had a Alfredo base and came with large portions of Porto 'shrooms drizzled with pesto oil. Not as good as the counterpart but a good option nonetheless. 

There's a discount for a rewards program for bikers, you have to purchase a sticker for $5 but entitles you to a discount each time. Inquire the next time you stop in!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and delivers to the concourse.  Nice clean place to go to as well"}
{"text":"5 stars for having vegan pizza!! it's really good!! The dough is lovely as well as the veggies and the service was wonderful and friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza specialties are diverse and delicious. But don't bother ordering a pizza to go, what a rip off.  Had a slice of the specialty pizza with brisket and tots for $3.75. It was very good. Went back to order a large 2 topping pizza to go.  Granted its hard sometimes to find red peppers offered as a topping, but Dominos does so NOT that hard,  For a large pizza with pretty sparse toppings compared to the specialty slice it was $27 for what amounts to 8 slices. I'd have been better off just ordering 5 separate slices of specialty pizza to go and gotten a variety of tastes and definitely MORE toppings for CHEAPER!"}
{"text":"The state street crew is always polite and happy to be serving even at 2 or 3 am. I know how frustrating drunk people can be but these guys are always cheerful and not to mention fast. I really appreciate the hard work that they are doing! Delicious pizza thanks guys!"}
{"text":"While I wasn't brave enough to try exotic concoctions, like the Mac & Cheese slice, the traditional cheese slices were scrumptious.  Great slices and friendly staff.  Great lunchtime bite."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom. They have delicious pizza here! I really like the BBQ chicken (?) pizza. I think it's BBQ chicken with ranch and whatnot. Whatever it's called it's the BOMB.COM!! Typically, when I go to Ian's pizza, I just point at that delicious slice of heaven and wait anxiously to stuff my face with this ginormous piece of goodness. Definitely a good cheat day food that won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"so we waited since 6:50pm, we just called and you say it will be here in another 20 to 25 minute which is past 9pm. 

i called after an hour and YOU said the delivery guy just left. i call again and you say it is not on the way yet....

Not just deciding not to even get here because you couldnt reach me through phone is not right. you could least email or imessage me. 

the delivery system is just messed up. and seriously, the guy that responded to my call should just stop working at Ian's. 

this totally ruined our girl's night."}
{"text":"Ok, I understand the concept - throw anything you can from a sandwich or pasta dish on a pizza crust and wa la! Ian's pizzas. Honestly, I wouldn't even really call it inventive - it was almost like one of the owners were at their neighborhood Portillo's and thought, \"I can throw all of this stuff on a pizza crust!\" If that's what really happened, we should all be kicking ourselves in the ass for that one.

It's kinda the same as Cici's Pizza Buffet except with more inventive flavors and better quality (for $5 I'd still go with Cici's!). However, it's much closer to drunken pizza than gourmet. Thus, the 2:30am close time. We had a BBQ Chicken pizza, Breaded Chicken Alfredo pizza, Philly Cheesesteak pizza and a Pesto Alfredo pizza. All, from the sound of the flavors, screamed delicious. Unfortunately, all of them lacked flavor except for the the BBQ Chicken pizza. It was pretty decent.

Overall, definitely go after the bars for Ian's and hit up Pizzeria Uno's down the street for dinner instead."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but it took almost an hour and a half for delivery 8 minutes away. I wouldn't have ordered if I'd of known."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff, quick service and they go out of their way to use local and organic ingredients!! Locally owned too!!"}
{"text":"Uniquely flavored pizzas.  You have to try at least once if visiting Madison."}
{"text":"I was at Ian's with my husband and two young sons. It was late for lunch, so not crowded. The pizza flavors and toppings were interesting, but seemed like they had been sitting out for a long time. After re heating, the crust got a little stiff. Overall, friendly atmosphere and unique offerings.  It is probably amazing fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I love this place due to the nostalgia of college life at the UW. I came here tonight after being away from Madison for years, and I have to say it did not disappoint. I arrived at bar time to a line, but no matter. I knew what was at the end of the line, a delicious piece of customized pie the size of your face. And the new location that could accommodate me so I wasn't sitting on the curb like days of yore sweetened the deal. The staff was friendly as always and the food was as amazing as I remembered. If you want a slice of downtown Madison you came to the right place, this is a necessary stop if you're looking for the downtown feel of our wonderful city."}
{"text":"A quick weekend trip to Madison would not have been complete without a late night stop at Ian's. The line was INSANE (or at least it seemed so to me, as an out-of-towner) but no one seemed even remotely perturbed by the idea of waiting 30 minutes while the smell of hot pizza wafted teasingly through the air. Obviously this was a challenge for me...

I had heard from enough people that the macaroni and cheese pizza was \"out of this world,\" and once I saw the greasy, beautiful thing behind the glass on the counter, my mind was made up without thinking twice about my other options. 

Maybe it was the alcohol, the delayed gratification of waiting in line for so long, or the hype. But I swear: that Mac and cheese pizza is the drunkfood of the gods. Somehow, the Mac and cheese remained soft and creamy on top of crispy pizza crust, and the whole thing was basically an ode to the glory of cheese.  I was torn between scarfing down my slice or savoring each bite. I opted for a combination of the two, and my pizza was gone way too fast. 

Bottom line- I would fly back to Madison just to eat this again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an afternoon slice + a salad last weekend. The crust on the pizza was good, and the price was right. The service was great, too, as the guys behind the counter were quick + thorough, but remained polite.

No complaints, really."}
{"text":"Ians is the most quintessential place in Madison.  A must for all visitors.  Its not just pizza, but pizza with a spice.  Big thin crust slices, and you will not find your ordinary flavors here.  Go with the classic mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Ian's mac and cheese pizza was a late night staple of mine at bar time in college. So many different slices to choose from! They have some very original pizza toppings as well as the classics. They also deliver which is great for lazy evenings with friends. Whole pies can get a little pricey when your order with specialty toppings but it is so good that it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great specialty pizza and service even though it was quite busy."}
{"text":"Loved the Wisconsin salad. Great pizza on thin crust. 3 stars bc there is no recycling and they use paper plates for every slice. Good staffers"}
{"text":"I'm always enticed by the wide variety of Ian's specialty pizzas, and I've never been let down.  On top of that, their traditional pizzas (pepperoni, sausage, you know, the standards) are spot on as well.  I've only ever by the slice at Ian's, but you can also order an entire pie.

While the pizza is great, the staff is fantastic.  They're always very friendly and willing to tell you what is on each of the specialty pizzas.

Ian's is great for lunch after the farmer's market, and even better after an evening at a bar on the square or along State St.  I'm reluctant to give Ian's 5 stars only because, based on taste, I prefer Roman Candle.  But for the environment and speed of service, Ian's is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is famous in Madison, and rightfully so, as they sell by the slice pizza with crazy delicious toppings. Mac & Cheese pizza never fails. I also like the Spinach Feta pesto for a savory cheese flavor. They have specialty slices each month to keep things new and exciting. They're open late too, and with two locations downtown, they're never too far from the bar you're at for a late night bite. You won't be disappointed getting a slice of Ians, drunk or not."}
{"text":"Amazing spring salad! The strawberry ginger salad is truly awesome! Pricey but totally worth it! I added grilled chicken as well--makes it plenty of food for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Thank you, Ian's.  Thank you for the slices and the solidarity.  Thank you for providing people from around the world (Antarctica!) with an easy and accessible way to connect with the people in Madison."}
{"text":"I know.... Everyone LOVES Ians.  For me they're little better than OK.  I wait in line with no guarantee of getting a seat and they reheat my slice and the crust gets too hard to cut with their cheap plastic knives.  I just don't see the appeal."}
{"text":"Creative combinations but good old cheese-by-the-slice is top quality, and that is what I am concerned with."}
{"text":"I don't get it. People rave about this place. I go in... They have a couple pies with random veggies and barely any meats. The mac&cheese pizza is supposed to be delicious. I ordered a pizza with sausage and pepperoni and they can't serve that to me? Then in order with some meats. The guy proceeds to tell me about all the slices they have with mushrooms and peppers... It is like they don't listen.  I'm not mad.. I am more confused. Like why do people like this place? What a waste of time. 

Skip"}
{"text":"This is a good as thin crust pizza gets in the Midwest and you know it. Maybe a New Yorker would not be as impressed, but as for us corn-landers, the crisp crust, high quality ingredients and playfulness played out on a pie is all we can ask for. 

Did you know that if you want a particular slice, if you call ahead they'll make a whole pie of it just so there's a piece for you? We do that with the kalamata mozzarella slice.

I do have to note that 3 out of 3 times I have had Ian's delivered, it arrived undercooked and cold. We learned our lesson and just don't do that anymore."}
{"text":"After a terrible wait at a \"high end\" restaurant downtown we finally gave up and had to have some food now.  Enter Ian's.  Fast, clean, convenient, cheap, and pretty tasty.  I'm not going to claim the best pizza, but it's good and they've got a great variety.  I'd do it again."}
{"text":"The slices of pizza are really large and definitely unique! The barbecue chicken and ranch was delicious, and the fettuccine chicken Alfredo was pretty good too. 

Overall the pizza is pretty oily. I was dabbing it (like the dance move) with a napkin constantly. It also is a bit pricy, as each slice is $4 meaning if you get 2 (a reasonable portion) it is $8. I know there's places where you can get an entire pizza for just above that. 

Again, the slices are big and the choices are unlike a lot of other places. Definitely recommend for an occasional meal."}
{"text":"Had a slice of pepperoni and another of some amalgam of mushrooms, feta cheese and some other veggie toppings that was in the viewing area.  They were super greasy, and the crust was tasteless and way too crisp (tasted fried).  They looked better than they tasted, unfortunately.

As others have said, I found the selection impressive, but the quality just wasn't that great.  Personally, I'd rather have 'simple and tasty' over 'zany'.  The price is definitely right though - 2 slices and a can of pop for $8 isn't bad at all.

I'm willing to give it another shot, though, and try out some other combinations."}
{"text":"I went here at 10:30 am and I am extremely glad I did. It is never too early for Ian's pizza. The line wasn't long since it was early and the prices weren't too expensive. The chicken BBQ was the best I've ever had, and the MAC n cheese wasn't too bad either. I also got a side Caesar salad which was good as well. Great atmosphere and amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!  I was visiting from out of town and while I understand this is a college town, I've never been treated with more disrespect. I asked a gentleman in a blue rowing shirt and Oklahoma City Stars hat if I could ask him a quick question to which he replied \"you have exactly four seconds\" not quite sure there could me a more lazy response?! Get it together...I was trying to order a gluten free pizza, which takes 20 minutes, and in trying to expedite process you forget even basic social skills. Good luck after graduation....you'll be lucky to make it out of the enterprise rent-a-car trainee program."}
{"text":"Ian's was recommended by a friend. The Mac and cheese pizza was super. It had a warm and gooey texture and felt like eating an old favorite comfort food. Ian's had 14 different slice options out when we stopped by. $3.50 for a huge slice was really reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Macaroni and cheese pizza? cheeseburger pizza? Yes please!
Ian's is awesome. They do a fabulous job catering to the college students, and serve up some mean slices late at night!

The staff is really accommodating to clearly enumerated students as well, and this is always appreciated. 

Slices are big too, which is great!!!"}
{"text":"I am a pretty spoiled foodie. I'm from two of the most 'foodie' places in the United States. Yet, I haven't had better pizza than Ian's. Maybe it's because that in college, nothing beats going there at 1 am. Regardless of that, Ian's  is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant. I really recommend their sausage penne or their mac and cheese pizza. Whenever I have friends who come to visit, I make sure to take them here and they're always blown away by the quality of this cheap college pizza. I love you, Ian's Pizza."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ian's pizza and I have heard great things, but I am wondering if the rave reviews are for the dine in option only??
Sad face!!! 
I ordered my lunch here today through the yelp app, I placed my order for delivery at 2:30pm from work (less than one mile from the restaurant) and hoped that it would arrive by 3:15ish at the latest. I think this is a realistic window.  It arrived at 4:00pm and was very cold, like so cold I wondered if it had ever been hot. This is a serious bummer by this point I was so hungry I ate some of my pizza anyway and didn't call to complain. I don't feel like I got my money's worth and this is a rare feeling for me $20.55 for delivery of a small cold pizza and a drink. 
It will take a lots of optimism to give this place another chance, one thing I will say is I will certainly dine in if I do."}
{"text":"It's the stuff of college and hipster dreams...uniquely topped pizza by the slice! They're known for the Mac n Cheese pizza, which is in fact delicious. But with other options like Smoked Brisket and Tots, Spinach Feta Pesto, and Quesadilla, how can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"Before I begin to get hate mail I want to stress that this is my opinion!

I get the concept and understand that some people just love Ian's Pizza and the many variety of pizza from Mac & Cheese, to Quesadilla, to BBQ Cheeseburger or whatever that was.  They have found what works for them but it is not for me.

We had Ian's at our monthly office Pizza lunch and honestly it does nothing for me at all.  I sampled almost all of the exotic pizzas as well as the standard sausage and pepperoni pizza and...nope.  No zing or \"this is an amazing pizza\" feeling/taste.  I guess the pizza just lacks the flavor I am looking for in a Pizza."}
{"text":"I don't even know what kind of pizza I had, it was with mozzarella cheese, basil and tomato.  Since I'm lactose intolerant I took the cheese off.  It was still good.  I was jealous, my niece and husband had the Mac and cheese pizza.  Gosh I was ready to throw in my lactose intolerant card out the window and have a piece but I didn't.  I had a bite of my husband's and it was excellent. We will definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for 2 slices and breadsticks w/ sauce.  FYI - The marinara sauce for breadsticks has hot sauce in it.

Great selection of flavor combinations.  Not too much cheese or other condiments on each slice. Perfectly cooked, where even the noodles on a slice were perfectly cooked just past al-dente.

The State Street location also comes with a lot of interior ambiance."}
{"text":"Got our order wrong. Treat everyone as if they're drunk. Small half-black or Asian girl that served me was rude and unhelpful. Avoid this place unless you want to be treated with disrespect. Kid run."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the Mac and Cheese pizza, you really haven't moved to Madison yet. It is not only very good, it is a defining experience. Also, fun fact, the extra large is so big it could be a table. You would need to petrify it or something because it would be a floppy-pizza-table, but it would be the appropriate shape and size."}
{"text":"The salad is superb if you know what to order ;) but the music is soooo old. They need to update their playlist. I swear it's the same shit they've been playing for four years. Neutral milk hotel, peter bjorn and John, band of horses??! are u serious?"}
{"text":"I have loved Ian's Pizza for a very long time.  My favorites are still the Pepperoni, or the Buffalo Chicken.  The crust is so crispy, amazing Wisconsin cheese.  I often still try new combinations even after 10 years.  I love the salads.  The ingredients are very fresh and the salad are awesome."}
{"text":"Mac-n-Cheese is all you need to know. Thanks for all the great slices during the anti Walker recall marches and sleepovers inside OUR house!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't written this review yet...maybe it's because mere words can't describe the magic of Ian's Pizza...

Whether you're drunk or sober (but especially when you're drunk), if you make your way up State Street towards the glowing lights of the Capitol...a slice at Ian's will never disappoint you. Going the safe route with cheese or pepperoni is fine, but I highly suggest that you take a bite out of their pizza of the day or even some of their more fantastic creations -- cheeseburger? buffalo chicken? Or everyone's favorite...Mac n Cheese? The salads are fantastic as well, I usually pig-out and grab a Southwest salad with at MINIMUM 2 slices and a tall Green tea drink (in the fridge under the checkout counter). 

If you're a newbie and not sure what to do after you put in your order, look up and look at all the eager (and sometimes annoyed) faces standing around for their slices to finish heating up. It's quite impressive when they remember which orders belong to who(m?), and it's a fun show watching everyone eagerly grab for a pizza slice that isn't theirs. I have yet to have a slice stolen from me, but maybe there's a better system? Either way, still fun, and still amazing. 

Yay Ian's!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, but delivery was 92 minutes. Please state this on your website & on related delivery sites/apps."}
{"text":"Killer quick cheap pizza slices. Always come here when I am in the city. Never disappoints all the choices for pizza."}
{"text":"This place is different during the day! Came here to get a slice of the famous mac and cheese, and the poutine pizza. Line wasn't bad, even for a lunch time! 

Mac and cheese is always a favorite, the poutine was interesting, not sure how I feel about it. Seems like it was a seasonal one though, so I'm glad I tried it. Always happy that Ians brings in some crazy combos for their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most visited place in State St after closing time. Be prepared on having a hard time choosing between the different kinds of pizza. They have quite a selection, and each one has a unique taste. 

The specialty pizzas cost $3.75 per slice, which you should always choose by the way. Overall, I like what they have, and will be back again if I'm in Madison. Especially great when you're \"drunk-hungry\"."}
{"text":"Hour and a half delivery time was my option.  Offered $100 tip for something faster.   They thought I was joking.  I literally had a hundred ready to go but they wouldn't do it and thought I was joking.  They even hung up on me. I get that since it seems over the top but I was serious.  Sad face :("}
{"text":"Great place for fun pizza. Eating healthy? Have a salad, they are wonderful. Be sure to get a bunch card if you're a regular."}
{"text":"A short review for Ian's. I've been coming here since before they changed locations. It's been consistent, it's been good.

Ian's is one case where I think less is more. Normally, I love to get outside the box and try the weird things on a place's menu. Here, though, their normal slices are painfully underrated in favor of their mac and cheese pizza.

The mac and cheese pizza is overrated, guys, it's tired. It's just not that good. Sorta boring.

Okay, I'm done beating up on Ian's, I swear.

The sausage with cheese is where it's at. Their pepperoni and mushroom is great too. Ham and pineapple is always a classic, too.

Don't get me wrong, their more eclectic offerings are always tasty. I remember a baked potato pizza they did once being one of the most interesting things I've tried, and the reuben pizza is always good too, when they have it (although you could make anything reuben flavored and I'd eat it right up!), the brisket and tots pizza is another fantastic option. but I really recommend not overlooking the less unusual offerings too, because they really can hold their own in Madison's sea of cheap pizza.

The end."}
{"text":"Your standard Ian's. We had one in Wrigleyville in Chicago, but it changed to Dimos (assuming owners changed). Love that there are non-dairy options (had a friend w/ a dairy restriction). We picked up our pizzas with no issues."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Madison. The prices have gone up since I've been a student but the pizza has only gotten more delicious.

They have your mundane cheese, sausage, and pepperoni of course. But for the more adventurous, they have the best Mac and cheese pizza. My personal favorite is the Philly cheese steak pizza. They are always coming up with new ones too, Hamburger pizza, taco, spicy chicken, steak and fries, etc...

Great for lunch, dinner, or bar time!"}
{"text":"mac-n-cheese pizza !? never heard of it , and never had it before going here. and I do not even like mac-n-cheese. I am just a tourist and hey ,why not try!? , a lot of carbs, sure, I will think about that tomorrow...., I am glad I did try. It is actually quite good!! I also had a slice of something called Smoky ?? pizza. ( basically , it is  grilled chicken, bacon, pineapple, and BBQ sauce at the buttom.) I thought it was alregiht, becasue too much BBQ sauce on it.  I bet my HB will love it a lot! Bunch of meat in it.
This is a place that you may have creative pizza!"}
{"text":"Ohh man is this place great or what? 

Their selection of pizza is amazing. Buffalo chicken, Mac N' Cheese, BBQ Chicken Pineapple, Chicken pesto... you name it, they'll have it.  

Also, they're open till 2:30am, which basically labels it as drunk food haven for college students and young people alike. 

And hopefully by that time, you'll be too drunk to worry about all the calories you're consuming."}
{"text":"Writing a review for Ian's is probably pointless, as it is (quite rightfully) a Madison legend at this point. Ian's is great. If somebody tries to tell you otherwise, throw them out of the nearest window. PROTIP: Waiting for the 6 to take you to Target on a cold winter's day? Go get a slice at Ian's! It's the most fun I've ever had waiting for the bus."}
{"text":"Took a day trip to Madison with some friends.  Before heading back home we wanted a late night snack and weren't too far from Ian's.  Big slices of pizza with fun different toppings.  I had a potato, bacon, and ranch slice.  This was delicious and I love pizzas that use barbecue sauce instead tomato.  The sweetness of the sauce brings happiness to my belly.  One of my friends like going here because she has a vegan diet and Ian's will make you a pizza with vegan toppings.  You can't get a big slice of vegan pizza, you have to order a whole one.  This place is great for that late night snack as they're always open late.  I wish the Green Bay pizza equivalent of Ian's would have those same hours."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were visiting Madison and stopped in for a few slices of pizza. Ian's sells pizza by the slice or pie, and they have a very wide range of pizza toppings. We ordered 1. chorizo quesadilla, 2. drunken ravioli, 3. baked potato, and 4. pepperoni and mushroom. The slices are $4 each and well worth it. The ravioli pizza was absolutely incredible and easily the best slice we had - if i were to visit Madison again, I would definitely stop by Ian's for more ravioli pizza. The chorizo and baked potato pizzas were really good, but I think I'd like to try more of their other pizza styles/topping before going back to either. The pepperoni and mushroom was actually my least favorite (though this simple topping combo is my go-to), mostly because I thought the pepperonis were a little flaccid and disappointing.

Also important is that Ian's uses local ingredients and seems to treat their employees better than maybe some other fast food and pizza joints ($10/hr starting wages, bonuses, healthcare options). If these things matter to you as they matter to me, then there's even more reason to support Ian's. These practices earn Ian's an extra star from me resulting in 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. The first time, I was one of the few people in there and ordered two slices (one of the famous mac-and-cheese and one of the pepperoni). Two slices is way more than one person needs but I didn't really know that at the time. Both were really good! 

The second time, it was incredibly busy and I ordered the same two slices, but they must've forgot my pizza in the oven or something because both slices were a little burned. Not enough to say I'd never go again, but it was kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"I love Ian's Pizza, but am not a huge fan of the crazy toppings which I know they are known for but don't overlook the regular \"boring\" pizzas--you can get a great cheese or pepperoni pizza here !"}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is a staple of State St food, and you have to go eat there if you haven't yet.  The pizza reflects a lot on Madison, quirky, interesting, and easily palatable.  They are open super-late night (2 AM), and are a great snack for when you get tired of Parthenon gyros at night.  The pizza itself is not the best in madison, but it is fast, convenient, and has more selections than anywhere in town.  The toppings are always thought out pretty well and all seem to mesh together without too much clash.  The crust is a nice vehicle for the toppings, but it can get a bit dry and can lose some flavor.  This is balanced out by the toppings, which can get a bit greasy. 

It is hard to recommend a specific slice that you have to get besides the mac and cheese since the menu is always changing, but the taco pizza with Fritos is awesome and I am excited whenever they have it.

In summary, the pizza is very good and covers everything you want out of a pizza experience, the only drawbacks being the slices can be a bit dry or greasy. The slices come out hot and tasty, the atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming, and experience is quintessentially Madisonian."}
{"text":"Had this delivered recently while on a trip to Madison.    It was better than expected.  It was simple, good pizza.  None of those wierd gimmicks that a lot of places try to make them different.  You know the ones... special crusts, secret recipe sauces, etc.

Simple, good quality can strike the right note, and this place struck it well.  My only gripe is that the crust was a bit thin.  When crust is thin, it needs to be extra crispy.  This wasnt as crispy as I like it.  Minor isdue though.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Another five stars for being pro-labor. Amazing operation-- they have closed down all business other than making and delivering donation pizzas during the demonstrations in Madison, WI.  Just call 608-257-9248 and hit 3. A super friendly person will answer the phone and take your order. They've made it cheap and easy to help-- a flat rate of $20 per pie that feeds 8 people. Be sure to add a tip for the Ian's workers who are no doubt busting their behinds in support of the WI demonstrators and you've done a small thing to help during this historic time. Listen to some Billy Bragg and thank your lucky stars that unions fought for your right to a daily lunch break in which to enjoy some pizza of your own on a winter day in balmy California."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza- crust is perfect with the right crunch on the bottom and outer crust is yummy chewy. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Search for \"I love Ian's\" in these reviews and you probably can't count on both hands the number of results you find.

If you're only going to eat here once, you obviously need to get the classic mac n' cheese pizza. My friends and I like to add some freshly ground black pepper on top when we get it delivered - it goes great with the bechamel sauce that's on the pizza. They have tons of other interesting combinations, and you can always make your own, but you really can't go wrong with the classic.

We had a funny mix-up here once. We ordered online and wanted a spinach, feta, and tomato pizza, but instead received spinach, feta, and potato. They were apologetic and gave me a credit for a free pizza :)

They take macaroni and cheese, and put it on a pizza. They deliver. Their customer service is excellent. They make slices of pizza that are bigger than your head. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Holy pizza selection.  This place looks like a mad food scientist designed the menu.  I counted at least 26 types of pie.  I couldn't get a good count, it was busy.  
I went the the Mac & Cheese pizza.  You don't see that style often (exactly one time for me) and it's Wisconsin Cheese baby.  Let's just say it wasn't that good.  
The crust was flat, with no real texture, and the mac n cheese lacked flavor.
I want to like this place, I will try again."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Madison, we decided to get a pizza. It was late and Ian's was open! They delivered to his dorm, and they were pretty much faster then any of the cabs we took that night. I was worried when I ordered the medium because there were 3 hungry people to feed, but my fears were displaced. The pizza was huge. We got a classic (half pepperoni, half cheese) and it was great! I can't wait to try different toppings. I don't think you could go wrong with a pizza from Ian's."}
{"text":"A fantastic option for a slice on the main drag of downtown Madison.  I stopped in rather late on a Thursday night with a group of co-workers and was pleasantly surprised to find many interesting topping options....such as macaroni and cheese pizza?  Who knew?  I wasn't feeling quite adventurous enough to try it this time around, but I am told it makes quite the after-drinking nosh.

I settled for a slice of pepperoni and mushroom and a drink, all for $4.50.  The slice was enormous, plenty for a late dinner (pre-drinking meal) and the crust was perfection.  They don't skimp on the cheese and the sauc is nummy too.  I got to try a couple of bites of the more exotic slices my co-workers got, such as chicken cordon bleu pizza and pesto pizza.  Plenty of options for vegetarians too.

I'd highly recommend this place for a cheap but delicious slice.  You'll have a hard time choosing your toppings....but that just means you'll have to go back again and again to try more!  I know next time I'm in Madison, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what more I can say here. Definitely a Madison classic, and so many mouthwatering choices. Definitely not your traditional pizza place, but always worth a stop for a slice and a few of the capital! They advertised a number of vegan and gluten free options (I didn't try them), and their salads look delish (again, didn't try them, I'm here for the 'ZA) but seems like you could find something to please everyone here."}
{"text":"This place is a kind of must-go place when you come to Madison. Large slices of pizza that were fun to eat, but not mind-blowing. Their main gimmick is mac & cheese pizza and steak & fries pizza. I tried the mac & cheese pizza and it was just what you think it might be. Tasty for what it is, though. It will definitely cure you of your hunger.

I definitely enjoy their vegetarian pizzas, including ones w/ mushrooms and olives on it. It was very tasty, just not the best."}
{"text":"MUST UPGRADE REVIEW TO FIVE STARS FOR IAN'S PIZZA AND THEIR HEROIC SUPPORT OF WISCONSIN PROTESTERS.

Arrived at about 1:30 AM and was pleasantly surprised by the absence of any line. Tried the macaroni and cheese slice, as well as a sausage and pepperoni slice. Both were good, but the macaroni and cheese slice was extra special -- although be prepared for a rich mix of cheeses if your stomach is not in top shape after consuming adult beverages.

The self-service water fountain was a nice feature, as was the plentiful seating. For a busy pizza shop on a college street loaded with bars, the restaurant was nice and clean, too."}
{"text":"A must-hit when I come to Madison. Lived on the mac and cheese pizza in college. So fun after the bars close, long line of drunks having a good time and chowing down. The selection of pizzas are phenomenal and the slices are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best pizza places I have ever eaten at--hands down!!!  Not only good for those late drunk nights downtown, but also great for a quick lunch Ian's serves pizza by the slice as well as pie and whole.  A MUST try is the Philly Cheese Steak.  I always have room for the Mac & Cheese as well as their BBQ chicken and pineapple pizza.  It's great that they deliver now too!"}
{"text":"Madison, Wisconsin is a miniature version of Chicago. It has the biggest party school in the University of Wisconsin system (UW-Madison), and it is a generally liberal community.

Needless to say, it has plenty of fine dining establishments. Many of which are open late to cater to drunken college students looking for something tasty in the witching hour.

Ian's pizza does just that, but it is (almost) equally delicious while completely sober.

With extra-large slices, interesting options (pesto, tomato and mozzarella pizza and mac 'n cheese pizza), and killer service, they are a necessary stop for anyone heading to Madison."}
{"text":"After a night partying in Madison, this place hits the spot.  The pizza is inventive, but as has been noted previously, not earth-shattering in its quality.  However, this is the only place I've ever had a slice of pizza with steak, fries, and BBQ sauce on it.  That's worth something."}
{"text":"Oh Ian's Pizza how I wish you lived near me... oh who am I kidding... how I wish I lived near YOU.  I can only speak for the kalamata mozzarella slice and it was mother frickin' frackin' delicious.  That is a damn 5 star slice o' pizza.  So good.  So amazingly good.  I could eat a slice every day good.  Oh right, I had a bite of a mushroom something or other pizza - deeeeelicious as well.  Health-wise, It's probably best we aren't neighbors."}
{"text":"Being from New York I am very selective about my pizza. This place is up there with quality as I had their mac n' cheese pizza and it was outstanding. The service is fast, friendly and the venue has plenty of room to sit. They were also opened on Easter Sunday which I thought was fantastic and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"$8 gets me 2 slices of amazing pizza and a soda. I'm good with that!

The pizza is incredibly tasty, which means Ian's has succeed in being incredibly good. There are lots of unique pizza toppings to try, but you can, of course, go traditional -- I always get pizza with feta, spinach, and tomatoes. YUM!

If you order a salad: 1) They make it fresh in front of you with whatever you tell them to put in it; and 2) It's huge."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison and some of the best I've ever had. Hard to not love this place."}
{"text":"Something I'd never thought I'd say about this pizza vs. Chicago pizza - it's better.  WAY better.

I had just gotten back from a trip to Chicago, and while I was there, I went on a pizza tour, thus getting to sample many different types of pizza.  And yes, this little place in Madison, WI was BETTER.  Than ALL of them.

Maybe it had to do with the \"unusual\" toppings, the huge selection, the friendly service... but whatever it was, it almost made me wish I lived in Madison so I could eat here more often.  Almost.  I live in San Diego, and Madison is just too damn cold for this SoCal native.

But anyway, the pizza.  After agonizing for several minutes about which slices to try, my friend and I split the mac & cheese pizza (her recommendation, as she lives in Madison and has been here several times) and something delicious with BBQ sauce, pulled pork, corn, and cheddar.  Both were amazing.  I couldn't decide which I liked better because they were so different.

I will definitely come back here when I visit Madison again... but not in April.  TOO COLD!!!  Brrr."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Madison, I at least have to hit up Ian's Pizza once. I sometimes miss the Mac N Cheese Pizza from time to time.

I love that they deliver and stays up until 2am. So when I'm craving some good pizza, I can always count on them.

Though, it is not the best pizza I've ever had... it's pretty damn good and the staff is always available to help you.

So far, I've had the Mac n Cheese, Buffalo, Spicy Hawaiian, and the Meat Lovers one. 
So worth it for the price."}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday and asked if they had vegan pizza knowing that Monday is their vegan day. The guy said they didn't have any prepared but he would prepare a vegan slice of what I wanted if I waited 15 more minutes. 
I thought that was incredibly nice. 
I didn't want to wait or make him do more work so I just got the vegetarian. I've been here 23 years and I wasn't a big fan because friends would always order mac and cheese pizza but I was surprised by how good the portobello pesto was. 
I'll be coming back for the vegan pizzas and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time was awful and today was too.

The way their cattle corral entrance it set up, if you stop to make a goddamn decision about the food you are there to eat, the staff gets pissed abd impatient like you're inconveniencing them.

The pizza is an insult to food. It's undercooked goo for a crust and barely enough topping to cover it.

Oh and don't say any naughty poo poo words after you have been directly treated rudely, disrespected and then ignored for 5 minutes by their piss poor staff while they take orders from 10+ people who order and walk past you while you stand there in the pizza gulag waiting. When someone finally came forward from the ovens and asked what was going on I said a naughty doo doo word  and got further treated like a bitch, being asked to leave the cursing out of it.

Fucking Madison Wisconsin and their incessant poncey bullshit. 

Ian's Pizza... don't bother. Pizza di Roma is right down the street and they know how to make a pie and take an order."}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is the absolute truth. I just moved to Madison from NY, which is the home of the best pizza in the country. And since I got here, I've tried a few places for pizza, but none held up to the pizza I've had my whole life. But Ian's does. Their specialty slices are excellent, but their plain cheese slice is NY quality, which no place else in the Madison area I've found so far can truthfully boast. This is the only place I'm going to be ordering pizza from. Anyplace else will be a letdown after trying their slice. That's coming from a NY pizza aficionado of 30+ years. Ian's runs Madison as far as pizza goes."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars simply because of the mac and cheese pizza.

The rest of the pizzas are good, but the reason why this place deserves a line out the door is the mac and cheese pizza.

At first it really weirded me out.  In fact I didn't even order one and simply bummed bites from other people.  Now that I have actually experienced the magic first hand, I will be making a return visit at some point in the future and will be sure to order the infamous mac and cheese pizza.

I hear this guy Ian, or someone he knows runs a pizza place in Minneapolis.  Hopefully they have the mac and cheese pizza as well.  But for some reason, I don't expect it to taste quite as good as it did in Madison.  Wisconsin is the dairy state after all."}
{"text":"Best place in town that will deliver.  Excellent drunk food.  Smokey and the bandit, amen."}
{"text":"Some people claim this isn't pizza.....and while i have to agree that Mac and cheese as a topping doesn't constitute a normal pizza, if it were a thing...Ian's pizza got it right. I am SOLD on their Mac and cheese pizza. I mean who doesn't like carbs on carbs? Now, for all you out there that want to say this isn't pizza, fine....it's not deep dish, its not pan, its a mixture of their own findings, but think about this situationally:

It's 2am you're hungry and don't want to pay for the surcharge that uber and lyft has placed for the night. Where are you going to go? IANS. yasss. and if this place doesn't hit the spot at that time, i know you're a dang liar. Granted I will critque the service as I do believe they need to work on a better process of getting the pizza heated up, but once that delicious piece of bread and cheese come out...you can not lie that it hits the spot. 

Also, if you're not into pizza's they do have salad, although i have yet to try it. BUT what i have tried is their breadsticks and those pieces of heaven mixed with their homemade ranch...WOW. so whether you're looking for drunk food on a Saturday night or some slices of pizza for your GNI, Ian's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Pizza offers unique creations and is okay, but cleanliness is another thing completely!!  When you step in, you will find practically none of their employees wear hats or anything to prevent their hair from falling into your food that they prepare right in front of you. Also, gloves should be worn when they handle peoples food.  I have given Ian's a few tries and every time, I find a finger print right in the middle of my crust from where they grab it (no spatulas being used behind the counter at this place).  GROSS!!  Health inspector should have shut this place down months ago!"}
{"text":"I mean, come on people! Mac & Cheese PIZZA! 

I've never met a slice at Ian's that didn't do the trick. De-lish!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best. Always get a slice of Mac and cheese! Staff is friendly but don't be surprised to see a slew of drunk college kids.  It's the too go pizza place to grab a slice if you're having a late night or just really really hungry."}
{"text":"I brought my fiancee here when she first moved to Wisconsin a couple of years ago and we've been loyal Mac and Cheese pizza lovers ever since. So far, family and friends we've brought here have also enjoyed the different (unique) selections."}
{"text":"Whenever my friends are in town, we always swing by here.  It's a pretty unique place (where else can you get macaroni and cheese on pizza??).  The only reason they only get 4 stars is because they took away their honey dipping sauce which used to be my favorite thing about this place.  BRING BACK THE HONEY!!  please."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth!!!  It's like the coolest best pizza in town type of place! 

So we randomly stopped a guy on the street and asked where we should go and eat as we are visiting and wanted something different. He told us that Ian's is where we should go and we took his word and found Ian's and thank God we did!

Amazingly different pizzas with the perfect topping that should be on a pizza. I mean, who can go wrong with Mac and cheese pizza, taco pizza or steak fries with ranch dressing pizza. Really... The best pizza ever! The place is nice and clean. They make fresh pizzas all day long so they have something different a few times a day. The staff is super friendly and they take the time out to explain what types of pizzas they have and so on. All the pizza are tasty and done just right.

I can't wait to go back and try their other pizzas.
A side note - so they have different special pizzas ever week so there is always something off the wall different to try!"}
{"text":"Ian's opened in Madison when I was in college. I'm kind of old. ;)  Anyway, many of my meals there (okay, who am I kidding - ALL of them) were consumed while I was feeling quite happy-go-lucky thanks to Wisconsin's awesome beers.  

I recently moved back to the Madison area, and a friend and I decided to try the Mac and Cheese pizza. I was skeptical that it would live up to my memories - would it really taste as good sober?  

I was pleasantly surprised that YES it IS still fantastic - without an ounce of alcohol in me!! The Mac and Cheese pizza was pretty much perfect.  Excellent flavor - good texture - cheesy, but not overwhelming. If you're going to put mac and cheese pizza, you better do it right - and they do."}
{"text":"If you compare the pizza in Madison with the pizza from Chicago or New York, Ian's would receive 3 stars max. But for a Madison-based pizzeria, I'll generously give it 4 stars (seriously though, isn't Wisconsin the state of cheese?). 

I appreciate Ian's multitude of specialty selections. My favorites are the bbq steak and fries and the philly cheese steak pizza. I'm not a fan of their macaroni and cheese pizza, but a lot my friends apparently love it. Give it a shot if you're curious.

Ian's is usually open pretty late, so after most people are done with their alcohol intake, this place becomes quite packed. But even so, the lines move pretty quickly.

If you want good pizza in Madison, Ian's is where it's at."}
{"text":"Granted we were just visiting a few days but learned Ian's has the best pizza in town!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in a long time! They have standard favorites plus speciality items like the Mac and cheese pizza and chicken quesadilla pizza.

The prices are low $3-4 a slice, the staff is friendly and helpful, but most importantly the pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"My sisters and I stayed at a hotel right next to this place. We are starved after we checked in and surprised to find this place open until 230am. Ordered a pizza and it was some of the best pizza we have eaten. Everyone working there was so nice and willing to help and answer any questions we had."}
{"text":"Ian's needs Madison and Madison needs Ian's.  This place is a must-stop near the capitol square.

The Mac & Cheese pizza will make you wake up in the middle of the night singing.  It's just too wonderful to not do at least a bit of a dance and song for.  The Gyro pizza was phenomenal, but sadly a \"month of June\" option only.

The salad options were very poor.  I built my own, and was horribly disappointed by the old mushy spinach I used as my base and some of the oldest and nastiest chicken I'd ever had.  They really don't sell enough of them to keep the salad line fresh.  The balsamic dressing was unforgettable... in a bad way.  Stay away.

The folks working are nice and helpful, considering half of the time you have NO idea what the slice is supposed to be (because it seems to be covered in chocolate covered skittles or something).

Come by, grab two slices and a Sprecher's Root Beer, and you've got yourself a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good salads. Amazing choices. I loved it and I am a NY pizza snob. The only negative was that there was not a lot of seating. Get there early!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into Ian's Pizza after midnight, and after going out to a bar. I imagine Ian's, a pizza by the slice joint with creative vegetarian options, makes most of its money that way. The line moves quickly, and the patrons are as noisy as they come, but the pizza is worth it.

I had a slice of pesto pizza and a slice of macaroni and cheese pizza. The crust was nice and thin, and the majority of the pizza was comprised of the toppings, which worked out well for these pasta pizzas. The pesto pizza was great: it lacked a strong pesto sauce, but it had this excellent combination of noodles, cheese, and seasoning. The mac and cheese pizza was also tasty. The mac and cheese actually sits on top of a white sauce. Each bite was better than the previous. A part of me thinks that Ian's offers better mac and cheese on its pizza than some Madison restaurants offer in their dinner entrees.

The service here was fine. It's the kind of place where you tell one dude what slices you want , who tells another dude what pizza to put where, who tells another dude what to yell out. It was a bit hectic, and there was plenty of miscommunication at the pizza pick up counter, but it ended up alright.

I'd definitely return if I was in the area craving pizza, or looking for food after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Good quality, creative pizzas.  Know what you want, though. I had the mac-n-cheese because of all the hype.  It was the best mac-n-cheese pizza I've ever had (and the only).  But halfway through I found myself wanting the steak-n-fries pizza or something with greens and more contrasting flavors. 

Next time, I'll know--order the pizza with the ingredients I want."}
{"text":"I first experienced Ian's at the Chicago location.  Now granted the alcohol may have created a biased opinion, but after realizing there was an Ian's in Madison, I was immediately enthused.  The idea of putting delicious dishes onto pizza which is almost always delicious in and of itself is mind boggling for sure.

Upon our arrival, we ordered 4 differnt slices to share and sample.  We took our treasures nearby lakeside to watch the sunset over bbq chicken, pesto alfredo, philly cheesesteak, and some other flavor I can't recall.  If it weren't for the scenery, the whole experience was wholly disappointing.  All four flavors were lacking in well, flavor.  The bbq chicken was the only decent of the four and the pesto was a far second.  Overall, it was quite the disappointment.

I don't recommend eating at Ian's unless you've had a few, but I do encourage you to stray half a mile near the school's campus to partake in the live music and summer scene."}
{"text":"excellent drunk food. mediocre sober food. 

smokey the bandit is the best! (when drunk)"}
{"text":"So, we popped into this place based on the reviews.  We are here for a college visit, and I'm trying to show my daughter the Madison I know and love from previous visits.  We ordered salads and waited in the long pizza line, sweating because no one believes in AC up here, only to be skipped when it was our turn to order.  When we finally got someone to ask what we wanted, I told the guy the other girl ignored us, and he didn't even bother to apologize. The cashier comped my salad after I remarked that we still didn't get an apology, and this is not how we do things in Texas. That was appreciated, but it came with very little actual contrition. The salads are okay, and the pizza good, but customer service was lacking.  Hopefully, that's an unusual occurrence."}
{"text":"\"Rly yum such good pizza\" says my 11-year-old, and we all agreed. Kids loved the Mac n Cheese slices, husband killed his pepperoni, and I recommend the tomato/spinach/feta. Great place to warm up after the Badger game, and truly appreciate the commitment to local farmers. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza has always been hyped up in Wisconsin, and I can see why. Their amazing pizza is cheap and really filling. The people serving it up are helpful with the different pizza toppings because their pizza trays don't have labels so you kinda pick and hope it's ok. And their pizzas are great! Their sweet potato and goat cheese one is probably what Whole Foods wants their pizza to be like, and their mac and cheese pizza is every stoner's dream. Their Spinach Portobello pizza is great as well. I definitely want to return and eat everything."}
{"text":"Call me a crazy man, but I just can't get enough of their plain cheese pizza and bread sticks with marinara. They nail the basics. The pizza is nice and thin, with a great savory crust. The bread sticks have just the right oil to bread ratio. It's a good time, for sure. One of the few lunch places near my work that I crave when I'm not at work :)"}
{"text":"My family and I are VERY impressed with Ian's pizza. We had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant but we were interested in trying it out for ourselves. This restaurant was everything we expected. I ordered the Mac and Cheese Pizza and it was very tasty. One of my family members was unsure of what they wanted to order so they asked the very hard working waiter at the counter and he gladly named off all of their many delicious pizza combinations. Another member of my party ordered an Asian salad and they were very impressed. The line was long to order pizza, but it moved fast and we ordered in less than 2 minutes, then received our food in another 3 minutes. The price is worth it. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I like eating here even when I'm sober. The bacon chicken ranch is my favorite non-Mac and cheese pizza. I like to think I am limiting my caloric intake by just eating one slice. It's cheaper that way too, and I achieve some self-deception! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Tried Ian's a few weeks back while up on the square finding out what democracy looks like . . . WOW, I am a big fan. They had a bunch of interesting and creative flavors to choose from. I tried the mac n' cheese pizza and a sausage pizza slice - my wife got a pesto chicken slice. We shared and all three were SO good. I have to say the freshness and the crust made all the difference. Perfectly cooked with just a little oven char for flavor. Thin crust but enough strength to hold up. So yummy, I've been hoping to go back again soon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't love it like most.

Kind of like NY style pizza, they make ahead and bake the pizzas, then toss them in the oven to heat and crisp up when you order, generally by the slice.  Big slices.

Good quality pizza and toppings, but I think they try to do to much - Gyros are great.  Gyro pizza?  Meh.  Having said that, the smoked brisket and hash brown pizza rocked.  

They have some salad options, which most people don't try, but the one I had was really good

No beer or wine (so sad).

Overall, I like it, but I have had better pizza.  Very convenient.  It's kind of a 3.5 star place.  The Pizza is 3 star, but the salads and the ease of getting fed bring it higher.   Perhaps I will go to 4 after I try it again"}
{"text":"I finally understand what all the hype is about this place! Probably the best pizza in town. I was pretty buzzed so I didn't wait in line to order. The line was long but not too bad. The pizza was fresh and just perfect! Not too thick with just the right amount of toppings. I don't usually like eating the crust but it was delish here! Will be hitting this place up again. Kudos to all the employees who work late here. Yikes!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to stop by and get a slice of pizza for a cheap price. The pizza has an authentic New York pizza style taste to it and is a decent sized slice."}
{"text":"I have dreams about this pizza...seriously... 

Some of my favorites include: mac n' cheese, quesadilla/mexican/not sure what it is called but it is AMAZING, steak and fries, chicken pesto, and so much more I just can't think of it right now...mmmmhhmmmmmm 

Ian's, if there was no such thing as obesity and heart disease, I would be exclusively yours ;)"}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to trying the \"best pizza\" in Madison. Played a show downtown last night & placed an order for 6 people online @ 8pm to be delivered a couple of blocks from the location as we would be leaving to drive back to Nashville @ 9:30. An hr later, no pizza. Called to inquire, & the employee assured me that our pizzas were in the oven cooking right now & would be delivered shortly. 10:15, now 2 hrs later, still no pizza. Our driver agreed to wait until it came, as he had not had dinner either. I'm still sure it's delicious like many had told me, but I wanted to find out for myself. I called again & the employee went to find my order. After being on hold for 10 minutes, he told me that couldn't locate it & it would be another 45 minutes to get it ready if we wanted to come pick it up since we were close by. I placed a delivery order at 8-8:15 buddy! I have traveled all over the world and have never waited 2 plus hours for any pizza. In the future, you should do everything in your power to admit you made a mistake not once, but twice, & get the order together as fast as possible to correct the issue. Ian's, I'm sure your pizza is tasty, but as patient as I am, I never got the chance to find out."}
{"text":"So many options! Love their pizza. Thin and very tasty. Obviously the mac and cheese pizza is a game changer. YUM"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their big, delicious, cheesy slices of pizza! My fave is the veggie alfredo, which has big juicy mushrooms and a killer white sauce. But they do rotate out a fun special every month and always have the staples (like mac and cheese pizza).

It can get pretty crowded in the wee hours of the morning at this location, but there's a lot of tables and pretty quick turnover (except when there are drunkies that can't walk out very fast because they really can't walk at all)."}
{"text":"A great place to go with kids young and old. We had unique pizza combinations including Mac and cheese, taco and quesadilla. As a pizza lover, this was the best crust I've had and loved the breadsticks as well. You can balance all the carbs with their great salads."}
{"text":"Scene: 1am, stumbling from who knows where, 2 cousins find themselves on the steps of Ian's.  What ensues?

Mac 'n Cheese pizza slice
Penne pasta pizza slice

oh.my.gawd."}
{"text":"Never disappointed in the crazy pizza concoctions here. I once stood in line for 10 minutes to get a slice. The service is spotty as there are so many different people here all the time, but I have only had two rude servers, mostly it does take a minute to order as you don't know which neato thing you want and they wanted to rush me, but usually it's a pretty nice person and it goes well (with over 50 trips to a place there are bound to be some off visits right?)."}
{"text":"Not that this place really needs another stellar review but what the heck ... LOVE IT!  So many options and everyone is outstanding. The Mac & Cheese za is stupid good!!! Whoda thunk it ...

Also tried the chorizo quesadilla pizza (their pizza with a tortilla she'll on top ... also amazing! 

And you cannot miss with a pepperoni slice ... top notch pizza and a cool location! We actually live in Minneapolis and drive back to Chicago to see family quite often ... we stop there every chance we can!  Sooo worth a few minutes out of our way!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in all of Madison!
Everyone can get exactly what they want on their pizza or try a new combination they hadn't thought of before.
The salads at Ian's are so delicious!  
Our family recently relocated to Tucson, AZ.  We would be elated to see an Ian's open here."}
{"text":"Although this pizza is fabulous any time of day, it could not taste any better at bar time, nor could the employees be any more forgiving of drunken antics. They know what they signed up for when they decided to stay open past bar time in downtown Madison, and so they are always friendly, and the place is always clean - even the single bathrooms!

I like the constant changing of pizza varieties, but also that certain kinds are always available for those who don't do well with change.

The $3 you pay for a slice definitely is worth the generous sized slices, and they do not skimp on toppings.

Super good pizza to grab on the go or to stay and chillax."}
{"text":"We stopped into Ian's for a quick bite before heading to the Children's Museum. My brother is a  local and mentioned it was a Madison staple, so we figured it was worth checking out. A quick walk from the Capitol, Ian's sort of reminded me of a New York City pizza joint in the sense that you order at the counter/by the slice, and seemed to dish 'me out pretty quickly. They have a unique variety of specialty pizzas (macaroni and cheese, BBQ, buffalo chicken, among many others) and the slices are very generous. As a feta cheese connoisseur, I, of course, selected the Greek which was topped with red sauce, tomatoes, spinach and feta - which hit the spot. Other table favorites included the buffalo chicken, ham and penne, and macaroni and cheese. Overall a great option for a fast (and local) meal."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick slice if the line isn't too long. Buffalo chicken and Mac and cheese pizza are both pretty good. Not special in any way but fast and reliable. With a restaurant that is actually better."}
{"text":"My best friends are from Wisconsin and fly back to visit their family several times a year. I live in Virginia. One common story I always would hear from them is how amazing the pizza is at Ian's. Well I finally got the chance to find out when I flew into Madison for my best friends wedding. I didn't get cheese curds first like I should've but instead I went for Ian's pizza. I got the mac and cheese slice, the brisket with tots slice, and a slice of pepperoni to be safe. Ian's held up to every word from all the stories I've heard about the place. The mac and cheese pizza was the best one to me. I'll be back again once Badger football starts."}
{"text":"It's good pizza, but not great.  It's good pricing for state street, but not great considering other pizza places in Madison that use real plates. They are good at supporting local causes, but not great, since it's very self promoting as they do it. Three out of five seems perfect. 

The weird variety is great, but the parking situation sucks. I go there for novelty, but not out of regular food enjoyment. Try Glass Nickle Pizza if you haven't yet. Better."}
{"text":"Ok - so I did it.  I tried Ian's Pizza.  You know what?  It was great.  I was not drunk but definitely tipsy.  Therefore, you can believe that I actually liked the pizza.  I really wanted something meaty and cheese so I went with the  pepperoni and sausage.  It was a bit greasy but nothing terrible.  Definitely late night food.  

I wanted an order or breadstick but apparently because they burned all of them, there were none for sale.  Sad.  Very sad.  I really wanted to try them, but c'est la vie.  I will be back again!  

My husband got their famous Mac and Cheese pizza.  I did not think it looked that great.  He convinced me to try a bite.  And...WOW!  WHAT?  YES!  It is really good.  I could not believe.  I am a non-believing naysayer.  I ate my words and wish I could eat more of that pizza.  

I will go again but there better be breadsticks this time.  Oh-boo, what am I saying?  I will go either way!"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Madison without going to Ian's.  Between the Mac 'n' Cheese pizza and the BBQ Chicken Pineapple slice, my day is made when I eat dinner here.  The staff is pleasant and efficient, and there's lots of seating for big or small groups.  Nice soda options available, including Sprecher -- which is always great to show off to visiting out-of-staters."}
{"text":"I just ordered a plain slice, and thought it was pretty good. Great size for the price. Reminds me of NJ boardwalk pizza"}
{"text":"First time having pizza in Madison and WOW. Slices were gigantic and so delicious. Tried plain cheese as well as feta + spinach + pesto combo. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm Ian's pizza!
Crisp crusty crust (yes that's a thing) and a great variety of slices to choose from make this a place of nirvana for pizza by the slice lovers everywhere!

Ian's is a must taste in Madison, especially if you never have been to a place with \"unique pizza's\" like Mac n' cheese or steak and fries. (yes fries on pizza that is also a thing.)

Oh and don't go straight laced and order cheese or pepperoni, you are at Ians, go bold or go home!"}
{"text":"I mean, like seriously, Ian's. If you haven't been here, you're missing an institution. Everyone in Madison loves this place.

It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but here's the deal... It's the place to be at 2-3am in Madison, Wisconsin. People watching was invented here. The employees are super chill and very inviting. Their pizza variety is second to none - they of course have some of the most unique varieties known to man. Their weekly special flavors are awesome - I wish they didn't stop serving them at 8pm."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese pizza is great and the price is very fair. $3 per slice for cheese and $4 per slice for a specialty pizza. Overall it is an amazing place for a quick and memorable meal."}
{"text":"This was awesome.  I fed my family of 10 with great pizza and it didn't cost much.  Love the mac and cheese pizza."}
{"text":"As a college kid living in downtown Madison-- this is obviously my go-to place for a quick slice of za and a cheap one, I might add. ALWAYS get 2 slices (big pieces but nothing wrong with leftovers). Be careful of late night weekend trips here due to HIGH traffic from all of us students leaving the bars and needing that sweet Mac n cheese goodness we're all obsessed with.
Atmosphere is upbeat & friendly and everyone working there is helpful and will walk you through every kind they've got on the line if need be. Salad options too, if you like that kind of stuff! 
Easy, convenient, and quick!

Happy eats
Aloha"}
{"text":"It's come to the point where we can't walk past Ian's without grabbing a hot slice of Smokey the Bandit pizza. The absolute best pizza on the menu with sweet bbq sauce, ranch, cheese, bacon, and chicken. I typically hate eating the crust on my pizzas, but even the crust on Ian's pizza is yummy."}
{"text":"Ian's pizza was my late night food after the bars for many years in college. Now that I moved, I realize what an amazing place this was! I miss the steak fry pizza and the Hawaiian pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza. I think this is what has contributed to many too drunk nights in the city that I live in now, all due to the lack of Ian's pizza to lure me into eating something. I think Ian's should go nationwide and that everyone will benefit from it's amazing pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place, both as a pizza place on it's own and compared to the Frances Street Ians. It isn't even close to the chaos of the other Ians, even at bartime, yet somehow supports a pizza selection that is just as big PLUS salads and more to drink. Also, the separate seating area with large booths make this a great place to eat for lunch, dinner, or bartime- cheap, fast, and easy environment that is very consistent."}
{"text":"Mac'n'cheese PIZZA and biodegradable takeout boxes. 'Nuf said."}
{"text":"It was okay, many choices, conveniently located downtown, and not expensive. The venue wasn't clean but they weren't unsanitary"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  It's by-the-slice (or options to order whole pizzas) with the classic topping choices or with more unique flavor combinations.  Yesterday, my wife and I stopped by for a slice.  She had the wildly famous mac and cheese pizza as I had a slice of chipotle sweet potato with portobello mushrooms, topped with fresh salsa.  I was halfway through my slice before I realized it was a meatless option, but it was by no means short on flavor.  The salsa was a nice touch with cilantro.  The mac and cheese pizza was on-point, as usual.  

You can't visit the downtown area without stopping in for a slice.  If you are hungry and looking for a quick bite, this is your place.  If you live in the Madison-area and have never had Ian's pizza, put it on your list of things to do."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza!! 2nd worse pizza I had and the service was rude.  Me and my girlfriend each took one bite and threw it out.  If you eat it then you must be starving!"}
{"text":"One of the beat restaurants for late night food near UW campus. You can never go wrong with the classic mac and cheese pizza, but all of Ian's slices are incredible. Perfect for people-watching and making random friends at midnight. Good vibes, good music, a great way to end your night."}
{"text":"What a cluster. If there is any other way to make a pizza joint more inefficient this place will quickly adopt it. Wow. What a bunch of slack jaws. How it takes 20 minutes to order and receive pizza that is sitting in front of you I have no idea. The mouth breathers behind the counter were useless. I'm mad. And the pizza wasn't very good. I should have been drunk."}
{"text":"So I went up to Madison this weekend, and was hurrying from one friend meetup to the next, without a chance to really stop somewhere for dinner. Despite my dislike of Ian's, the State St. location was open and convenient and I was hungry. While I liked it better than the Francis location, I was pretty dismayed to find out that they were out of plain cheese and pepperoni. I know that Ian's is known and loved (though I can't imagine why) for their \"specialty\" pizzas, but come on. I work in a coffee shop. A pizza place being out of cheese pizza is like us running out of coffee."}
{"text":"They had me at mac n cheese pizza! The mac n cheese pizza was just what I imagined, cheesy mac goodness with more cheese added. I also tried the brisket pizza, which had the perfect smoked taste. My tummy is starting to grumble, this place is where it's at for pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"$3+ for a slice of pizza is a bit much for me but the quality and variety is excellent at Ian's. I don't normally go out to eat for Pizza but it certainly makes for great late night food!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison, hands down. I have fond memories of eating all my angsty \"Woe is me\" college feelings at this place (freshman 15? try junior 32). 

I know a lot of college kids stumble in here drunk and/or high at 1 in the morning (I certainly did on more than one occasion). Late-night noshes are strangely hard to come by in Madison and this place puts the other ones to shame (Casa Bianca: I'm talking to you!).

I have tried many a time to recreate the magic of an Ian's pizza with semi-disastrous results. All my fave foods atop another of my favorite foods?!! How hard can it be? Mac n' cheese, lasagna, steak and fries...they all ended up looking (and kinda tasting) like a pool of vomit. 

I usually prefer mom & pop type operations like this to stay small and local. But I'm totally not-so-secretly hoping Ian's venture takes off and a franchise pops up in the Bay Area. That way I can stop pestering my Madison friends to bring Ian's pizza when they come to visit. It just doesn't travel well."}
{"text":"Ever since my early visits in Madison I wanted to try Ian's.  Somehow we always ran out of time doing family stuff, but this time we got to pick up some pizzas... 
Mac and Cheese, Florentine and Steak with barbecue sauce were really great!
I was not hugely in on the crust, although it is ok, but I very much like the flavors on the toppings and the staff were great!!
I look forward to trying more pizza as my grandson is going to be born this week and if he has our family taste for pizza, we must continue the tradition...."}
{"text":"Good pizza, interesting concept, but poor for delivery.

Their pesto pizza is solid, and their kalamata mozzarella is an inspired idea. When we first moved to Madison we could get two of their cleverly composed pizzas delivered for about $15, which was a bit cheaper than Glass Nickel, and due to novelty a better deal. 

The past couple years prices have literally skyrocketed, and last time we ordered two pizzas and a 2-liter we spent about $32 for the exact same meal (ok...add $2 for the soda). I realize they're popular and all but this seems like a callous money-grab to me. Quality hasn't improved or anything, the prices have simply doubled.

All that said, definitely worth stopping in for a slice. They're not the best slices ever, but a $2.50 pepperoni will keep you going on the run and the mac and cheese slice has become a deservedly legendary post-drink starchathon. The bread is way better than Glass Nickel but as far as Madison pizza goes Ian's is still middling compared to Brutta, Porta Alba, Greenbush, or Lombardino's."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overhyped. Average quality, good decor, good hours, some creative pies. There are better pizza spots in town for less money, but with more limited hours."}
{"text":"This reminds me of a place back home... I just wasn't as impressed.  However, I went with the top seller and got the mac-n-cheese, and it was pretty tasty, despite the sound of it.  I added a little hot sauce, and enjoyed that as well.  Long line, but moved quickly.  Decently priced too."}

{"text":"First stop every time I fly in to Madison. They make amazing pizzas you can't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't appreciate Ian's as much as the next person does and I highly recommend you try anything else in town, especially if you're sober and it's not even remotely close to bar close.

Better pizza options around town include: Grampas, Glass Knickel, and Echo Tap. None of these are same style pizza/expereince, but I like them all more."}
{"text":"Excellent. It's probably the best pizza I've ever had, better than what I tried in NY and even Italy. Pepperoni pizza is to die for... Yum!
Ps. I also ordered ice cream (hot peanut butter).. It was pretty bad; the strong spices with the heavy peanut butter did not make sense and it was downright inedible."}
{"text":"I love love love Ian's Pizza! I didn't go there much when I was in college however, I went there with one of my friends, who is a true Wisconsinite, and had the Macaroni and Cheese slice with Pepperoni and was sold! Apparently Ian's also makes breakfast pizza Saturday mornings during Farmer's Market. I've had that once and am in love! I just don't wake up early enough for it most Saturdays. I would highly recommend Ian's Pizza to everyone who comes through Madison to experience part of the Madisonian culture. Especially if you're on a late night adventure with drinks and friends."}
{"text":"The pizza is a bit pricey - but the variety is worth a look. For two slices you are looking around $7. The slices are big, but it sure seems like a lot! I enjoy their pizza, and given the opportunity would get it again. I just wish my pocket book were not so empty after eating here.

It might not be so bad if you are only feeding yourself, though. Give the BBQ chicken ranch a try - that's what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison, grew up on Ian's. Upon moving back from Florida after a year, the service has drastically fallen down. 1.5 hrs for a mac&chz add pep......I'm a chef so I know cooking time is 20 min tops. Overall my first experience with Ian's since I've moved back has a terrible failure. Perhaps in store is the only way to go"}
{"text":"I love Ian's! This is a great place to stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I usually go before the farmers market to get a breakfast slice or before a game. Even with the long lines they go fast and the staff really knows what they are talking about. I get recommendations on the pizza slice I should get every time and I am never disappointed. I have even ordered a whole vegan pizza and it was the most delicious concoction the staff came up with. Speedy, knowledgeable people with great customer service. The three best things!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese Pizza was freaking amazing!  The delivery took a while but the wait was worth it."}
{"text":"Yes, a teen with tattoos up the wazoo and piercing in places that you didn't think could be can be shockingly nice and welcoming.

They will gladly run through all the slice. They have monthly and weekly features. You can find them also on their website along with their salad special among other thing going on. 

I usually get a huge salad with a slice of pizza to make me feel healthy. For your salad you can choose one that is listed or you can make your own. Small or large with a set base price with additional cost for each topping.


On your way out or at the end of meal don't forget to pick up a pint of Calliope Ice Cream. You can't go wrong with any flavor but Sweet Old Fashioned is my favorite. Plus you only had one slice. You deserve it. Right?!"}
{"text":"Several boots and half-remembered shots later, we decided to head over to State Street for a bit, and ultimately found ourselves at Ian's Pizza for some late-night pie. We got in line, which actually moved fairly quickly through the modern space, and observed the other patrons enjoying amazing slices of pizza. When we made it to the front, I had a momentary panic trying to choose the perfect slice while not holding up the line. Instead of trying to decide, I finally just ordered all three I was torn between when two would have been sufficient: the Mac 'n Cheese, the Steak and Fries, and the Buffalo Chicken. But even then, at $3.50 a pop for the specialty slices, you're not exactly breaking the bank.

The Mac 'n Cheese is justly famous, and the cheesy, carby overload was the perfect grub after a night on the town. The BBQ Steak and Fries was like Sunday dinner on a slice, and the Buffalo Chicken was an eye-opener with that kick from the Buffalo sauce and the tart bleu cheese on top. And regardless what pizza you get, the crust is fantastic, crispy on the outside yet soft inside the ring.

Late-night on State Street can get a bit hazy, but just look for that iconic Ian's logo - the one with the headphones."}
{"text":"Was in town for one night to see a comedian. Was at a bar up the street and they recommended this pizza place. 
I was hesitate at first but it was only a block away. I'm glad I went! 

As soon as you walk in your overwhelmed with the smell of fresh made pizza. 

There was a short line and it moved quickly. It gave us enough time to decide on which types of pizza we wanted. 

We ordered breadsticks, a slice of Mac n cheese, Papa the Bandit and Penne Alfredo. Not sure if they serve alcohol but my girlfriend and I just split a pop. 

Once you make your choices and pay, they take a slice and heat them up. Then you wait until your food is ready. It took about 10 minutes. 

There is a lot of tables to sit at but they were filling quickly. 

Once we got our food. It was time to dig in. I have never had Mac n Cheese pizza before and wasn't sure what to expect. It was the right amount of everything! Thin crust, light layer of noodles, and a thin layer of cheese. I ate it quickly. 

The \"Papa the Bandit\" was just as good. Thin crust, light amount of BBQ sauce and meat and it all blended together well when you took that bite out of it. 

Lastly was the Penne Alfredo. This one had more of a veggie taste and side of meat to it. It was good but I should have ate it first because it couldn't follow the other 2 in taste. 

I would come here again, and highly recommend anyone to try their pizza! You will get addicted after the first bite!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time here, lots of different pizzas that are fun to try! All the employees are very nice. Most recently I went for pre-prom dinner (which was a great idea), and the food was delicious, everyone was very nice, AND we got two slices of free pizza! It was so nice of them! I plan on visiting more frequently."}
{"text":"Takeout was a miserable experience here. We were told 20-25 minutes for our pizza and it took an hour and a half. We were charged a service and delivery fee online and it was not refunded when we picked our pizza up."}
{"text":"I have been to Ian's many times since my son started at UW Madison and yet to be disappointed!  Great selections of pizza to chose from. The salads are also great!  Definitely a hit spot in Madison (there are two locations in Madison).  Staff are lively and engaging.  Fun affordable stop for a tasty lunch!   My Badger grad is moving to Seattle and we discovered there is an Ian's there too!! So I'll take on a secret shopper role and check out that location sometime too to see about consistency! :)"}
{"text":"This place is consistent.  Which for most pizza places is sign of a somewhat successful business.  The pizza has good flavors, but nothing I've had jumps out at being wildly outstanding.  There are a lot of specialty pies, but each one I've had leaves something to be desired.  The plain and pepperoni slices are actually pretty decent.  One thing that I will say was real solid was the beet salad.  I had that twice and it was on the money.

One major issue is just how slow it is.  Working downtown, at lunch I've waited 20+ minutes to get my slices.  I'm not sure how to fix it, but someone should look at some sort of process improvement.  Also, it would be helpful to put the names of the pies next to them.  Half the time I feel like I need to ask what is on each pie to help me make up my mind.  Overall, a decent place, but could use a few tweaks."}
{"text":"There pizza is awesome, just beware of the buffalo chicken! That son of a buck is hot! I love hot wings, green chilli, yada, yada..... But I couldn't even eat that buffalo chicken it was so hot, thank god we also ordered Mac and cheese my first having it and it was actually really good, I can't wait to have this place every time I come to Madison"}
{"text":"Best salad of my life!  Wisco Salad...$8 but it is a meal and a dessert all in one. Mixed greens, spicy candied pecans(so good!), craisins, apples, bacon, bleu cheese with maple balsamic vinaigrette...to die for! Oh and they have ever kind of pizza you could ever want.  Crust is crispy and super flavorful."}
{"text":"The pizza was better than my mood.

OK, I'll start by saying I was pissed off about getting to this place.  I live in St. Paul and don't know Madison at all.  Here I am trying to find Ian's while attempting to park and avoiding people holding signs.  The whole experience was entirely irritating.  However I tried to not let it impact my enjoyment of the pizza.

We walk in after lunch time and it's still kind of busy, so I'm irritated with that.  I don't know the order system and I see the guy taking orders doing everything but.  Again irritated.

Now that I'm over that to the pizza.  I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak pizza and a BBQ Chicken Ranch.  When it came it was super hot; too hot to eat.  The Philly had a good mix of cheese and green peppers that made it taste like a cheese steak.  I liked that one.  The BBQ chicken was good, but not remarkable.  It tasted like most other  BBQ chicken pizzas I've had.  Both pizzas had a nice crispy crust on the bottom, I like that.  The ends were a little too much.  I normally eat the whole piece of pizza, this time I skipped the ends.

I think this place would be great after being at the bar and needing to have something in your stomach the next day."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I found myself in Madison for the first time not to check out UW-Madison's grad school or to go on a tour of the state capitol building. I went to Madison to protest Scott Walker and my collective bargaining rights as a future educator. After several hours, I got hungry. We all got hungry. Word on the street was that there was a place called \"Ian's Pizza\" that was ready to help us in our time of need. 

I walked down the street and saw a long line that was moving fast. Ian's was doling out pizzas FOR FREE only for people who had been protesting. Firefighters, teachers, UW-Madison students, you name it. Ian's was happy to nourish us! 

As far as I was concerned, this is the best possible customer service you can get. The pizza was oily and a little floppy. I opted for plain cheese. At the time, they were probably in a crazy frenzy trying to feed all these people for free as fast as possible, so I feel like I can't pass official judgment on the place based on this one experience. 

5 stars for supporting hungry protesters, 3 stars for the actual pizza. Ian's has a warm place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza by the slice at a great price. I've never been disappointed and love the rotating flavors. Can also get great salads made to order and Sprecher root beer in the fountain."}
{"text":"I have now had two poor interactions with the state street location. First, I ordered 2 slices of pizza and an order of three breadsticks on Saturday evening. I ordered through ChowNow and was emailed saying the pizza would be delivered by 11:13pm. At 11:15pm I called on the store to check on the status of the order and was told it was out the door. I was fine with the delay because 1) it was a Saturday night and 2) it was a packers game. At 11:50 I called the store again because my pizza was still not delivered. The person i spoke to told me it was delivered by the delivery driver however I never received the pizza.

This evening (1/20) I ordered again. I was given a promise time of 8:13 and I called at 8:15 to see where the pizza was. I was told by the person i spoke with that the delivery driver was let into my building and called multiple times but no one answered. We discovered that my number was incorrect in ChowNow- this was understandably by fault. However- the person on the phone said the driver was let INTO my building but wouldn't walk to my apartment door? I live on the first floor and right next to the entrance where the apartments are clearly labeled. The store redelivered my pizza and this time the driver was again let into my building and walked straight to my door to deliver the pizza. I was VERY polite with the driver because I understand its a pain to redeliver when you were already at the location once. However the driver was rude and sarcastic back with me and suggested that \"yeah maybe next time you should me, you know, enter your number right\". It was so disrespectful that another resident commented on it. I was NEVER rude with the driver and did not deserve to be talked to in such a manner. I also never signed my receipt copy or was I able to tip the driver (i did not tip on ChowNow).

If the driver was let into the building on the first delivery he should have walked to my door because he was clearly able to walk there the second time. I am severely disgusted with the way I was treated and believe it to be extremely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I love Ian's pizza. I love that they're open until 2:30am on the weekdays and 3am on the weekends. 

Ian's has been my favorite late night post bar food for years. They have tons of specialty slices with interesting topping combinations like philly cheesesteak or eggplant parmesan or taco. The mac n' cheese pizza is my favorite along with the pepperoni. Even though their specialty slices are interesting, the best thing about Ian's pizza is not the toppings - it's the crust. Their crust is definitely the best crust of any pizza place I've ever had in Madison. It's thin crust, but it's not a soggy crust that doesn't bear up to the weight of the toppings nor is it a crispy cracker crust. It's a crust that's been kneaded and risen just enough that it has a chew and all the delicious yeasty-ness of what good bread should be."}
{"text":"Overpriced and doesn't taste that good unless you're drunk. I will say their breadstick upgrade is great. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the travel worn interior or the college crowd! If you like pizza, TRY THIS PLACE!! The set up is unique in that you start at the salad end and tell the salad staff, across the glass, what you want from the multitudes of greens and toppings on display. Then, saunter down the line and tell the pizza staff which slice/slices you want from the MANY pizza varieties!! I never thought I'd say this, but, I LOVE THE MAC 'N CHEESE pizza!!! Man oh man, is this one tasty pie!!! And THIS is why I'm giving Ian's five stars...that mac 'n cheese number is AMAZEBALLS!!!"}
{"text":"Was told they had Mac-n-Cheese pizza and frankly what else do you need to know? The place was busy, but the line moved quickly. 5 bucks for a slice of pizza and a drink wasn't bad at all. Not the best pizza I have had, but it is the only Mac-n-Cheese pizza I have had. 

If I lived here I would come back for a bite if nearby."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Ian's? Seriously. So many great choices at reasonable prices. I've tried do many different flavors and have never been disappointed. The staff is always friendly and willing to tell you what some of the creations are."}
{"text":"My standards are against Chicago Pizza and restaurants. This place rocks. Very casual but their creativity, taste and attitude are great.

This is the only place that I have enjoyed the pre-done supersized pies that then get reheated in the pizza oven for a couple minutes. Most places the reheating just does not 'work'-they end up tasting like bad frozen pizzas. Here the combinations are very unique with variations on the sauces (BBQ, Alfredo are often the favorite). 

We tried 4 different slices tonight, we still have not repeated but every slice seems better then the last. The Southwest salad is tasty, but the best part is they mix it up (fresh of course) with the dressing, so I end up with about 1/3 as much dressing and twice the taste as usual. 

The soda cups are a little small, but free refills are easy. They have Pepsi, Coke, Sprecher's Root Beer and a few others

The vibe is fun and the staff attitude is contagiously cool. I have taken a bunch of people there and all have enjoyed it.

Looking forward to trying some of the Saturday Breakfast Pizza's after doing the Farmer's Market loop a 1/2 block away from the Capital Square."}
{"text":"I love their new location on State! It's clean and the decor is bright and welcoming."}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is located next to Michelangelo's, and I stumbled upon it late this Sunday evening when other Madison venues were closed. 

They're staffed with three workers: one making pizza, one taking orders, and one ringing people up at the counter. What should be an easy in and out becomes a grueling ten minute wait to orders pizza by the slice. This issue could be resolved by labeling the pizzas, since the vast majority of patrons this Sunday evening were indecisive and kept asking the same question of the single pizza server: What kind of pizza is this? Even a billboard with the listed pizza combinations would be helpful with decision-making and wait time. 

The pizza itself comes in a creative assortment of topping combinations. The pasta on pizza combos-Chicken Alfredo and Mac n cheese are winners. Great place for a pre-run carb load or post-night out early morning chowdown. 

A single slice will run you $3-4, inclusive of tax. Bottomless soda is $1.75. Overall, this is carbs on the cheap."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some pizza, and thought it destiny that my cab driver recommended this place to me on my way into town without my having to admit that. Ian's is quite yummy even though it is thin crust and I'm more of a thick crust girl. But its really the creativity that won me over. 

Mac and cheese pizza? check.
Buffalo chicken pizza? check.
My standard tomato spinach and feta pizza? check.
Philly cheese steak pizza? with FRIES ON TOP? oh yes. check. 

I love my hips way too much to have tried all of these (tomato and spinach not withstanding), but the sheer sight of all those pizzas, so original, so hard to decide on, was simply breathtaking. 

Really, you should walk in just to see it. And if  you're not in to pizza, there is a create your own salad station (absolutely not your every day salad bar, my friend) that made me think twice about pizza. And that never happens : )"}
{"text":"It is Ian's Pizza!!!!! If your any where near downtown Madison and hungry the decision to eat here should be simple. 

So many unique pizza choices, so little time. 

I think once you have that first taste, and the perfect little crispy crunch of the dough, you will be hooked. I feel like the numerous times I ate here, I have never been let down. 

And who knew? Pizza is great sober for lunch from Ian's as well!!!!! I confess, Ian's is a go to late night joint, but I have recently found out that it is awesome for lunch as well. 

I'm pretty sure by now their Mac n' cheese is world famous. There is just nothing like it. Pure awesomeness. 

Take a walk on the wild side and hit up some Pork and Beans pizza or some Fritos pie! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 

Ahhhh Ian's, you had me at hello!"}
{"text":"All of the slices here are delicious, from the Philly Cheese Steak to the Guacamole Burrito.

Definitely the best pizza in Mad-Town.

If you ever have an opportunity to try the Gyro Pizza here, do it.  It is pretty much the greatest slice of pizza on Earth."}
{"text":"Though every slice I had here has been awesome, the cheese slice was the worst possible. The finest dusting of a non tasteful cheese. Do yourself a favor and order something else (everything is good). Or if you want a true cheese pizza, choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Ians late on Saturday night.  There was something for every taste.  We ordered 3 slices (feta and spinach, loaded potato, mushroom/cheese/spinach).  Everyone enjoyed their late night slice.  The place was well lit, fun environment, and service was fast.  

We left and when I got home I realized my coin purse which had nothing but cash in it was gone.  I called, was able to speak to a live human in less then 40 second.  They found my coin purse and held it at the font desk for me.  When I arrive EVERY DOLLAR was still in there.  

THANK YOU to the very honest staff at Ians who was working at midnight last Saturday!"}
{"text":"I'm giving ians 5 stars for being the best pizza place for late night pizza. I appreciate that they use fresh and local ingredients when they are able to. I also give them props for all the drunk people they have to deal with. I love their pesto, spinach and feta pizza. Another fav of mine is the chipotle sweet potato."}
{"text":"Can't say i'm a huge fan but it's ok.  Crust was a bit tough and bland for my taste."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice in Madison? Oh Yes! And it is very very good! Creative toppings which I love.

To explain how much we loved it; in the 6 full days we were there we went there 3 times! Crust was thin, chewy and a tad crispy and a nice crust to handle. I loved it!

My FAVORITE was the mac n cheese pizza! Each of the 3 times we went one of the two slices was a mac n cheese slice. :)

The toppings are fresh and creative. Not too much but not sparse. They are skilled in assembling pizza!

When you walk in you face a cafeteria style line. Where you tell them what you want and they prep it and meet your food at the cash register where you order your drinks and pay for everything. You start at the salad area...I smiled at the person standing as I ran to the pizza area. Sorry I can't review the salad. but everything look VERY fresh and customer rep was smiling and waiting to serve.

Move on down to the pizza line to see what slices are available. You can order a whole pizza with toppings you want, if you can wait.

Bottled/canned drinks in the fridge below the register counter, but they have fountain soda as well.

I am not a huge fan of pizza, but this place...WOW! A must try if you are in the area and like pizza and mac n cheese. I am sure tons of people posted photos of it. I put up a couple :)

Thanks IAN STAFF FOR the warm welcome and delicious slices!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever been disappointed in here was (and you're gonna hate me for this) the mac n' cheese pizza.  Now I LOVE mac. And I LOOOOOOVE pizza. But maybe the two of them together are a lot like me and my ex--better when they can be enjoyed away from each other.

I've come here for lunch, dinner, and late-night eating. I'm thrilled to bits with the selection at any given time. I usually go for something Southwestern-looking, or with BBQ and ranch (yes, both! You can go hard or you can go home, am I right? lol). When I'm feelin' frisky, I get the brisket and tots.

There are not many places you're gonna get it exactly how you want it, and straight outta the oven besides (I'm not docking any points for the reheating--I'm sure it's just as tasty either way).

The bathrooms are quite clean for a late-night establishment, and though there's always something colorful to read on the stall doors, they've never run out of soap, and that, my friends, is paramount.

I've heard they do brunch pizza. That will happen one of these days.  In the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy Ian's as it was meant to be enjoyed: late-night, ever-so-slightly inebriated, and in the company of some great strangers I've met along State St. that evening.

Just kidding about one of those points. ...Maybe."}
{"text":"Their pizza is good. It's nice that they sell decent pizza by the slice. They'd have a shot at the pizza part of my heart if Salvatore's hadn't stolen it all. 

Their salads are fantastic. A pizza place does not have the right to make salads this good. Probably better than most salads you'll get on state street- from a pizza place. Go figure."}
{"text":"There are tons of great pizza options here! I ordered the macaroni and cheese which apparently is a crowd favorite, but I've come to realize that I just don't love mac and cheese on pizza, so I can't vouch for it personally, but I would definitely go back and give the salad bar and other pizza options a chance.

Service was good, wait was not long, and atmosphere was fine. They also have a nice space outside for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Ian's Mac and cheese pizza is a staple EVERY time I visit Madison. It is so delicious. Their recipe is consistent, and it is a fantastic piece of pizza. I could scream from the rooftops with my love for their pizza."}
{"text":"Not much more to add than what's already been said. Ian's offers made to order specialty pizza that satisfies almost anyone's late night cravings. Whether you're in the mood for tacos, bbq, mac n cheese, etc., chances are you will find some variation of pizza that fits your bill here. My biggest gripe is the inefficient way they deliver the food after you wait, where someone behind you in line could easily be getting your order."}
{"text":"A cab driver recommended Ian's Pizza to us while visiting Madison, WI for the CrossFit Games. We went one night, and the next night when discussing dinner options, we decided we had to go again. YES, that good.

The salads are truly where its at. Ian's Pizza had a special salad curated for the CrossFit Games that had the best dressing on it. The soba noodles were a nice surprise as well, and the feta cheese was some of the best I've ever tasted.

Gluten Free crust was a hit. The only miss on the pizzas was the chicken (which we added every time). It had a little bit too much buffalo sauce on it for me and was just a little too spicy. I'd watch the seasoning on the chicken, or if you're really torn and don't like spicy things, don't add it! Atmosphere was crazy both nights we went, but the staff was organized, calm, and handled the crowds no problem."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here in Madison on business. We popped in after looking around at several other places for lunch. We were very satisfied with the speed of service especially during the lunch hour rush. Pizza was super good and the salad with homemade ranch dressing was great as well. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The business info is misleading in that the noise level is not average.  I was in there for lunch 7/20 and the music was blasting.  For me, this was not a relaxing place to have lunch.  I complained to the salad maker but she did nothing to correct the problem.  The customer's comfort should take priority over the amusement of the staff.  About two-thirds through my slice and salad (excellent, by the way), the volume appeared to get lowered, but by that time my ears could have been desensitized.  What good is fine food if the environment causes indigestion?  Will definitely rethink good old Ian's."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC & really miss good NYC pizza. I've lived in Madison for 3 years now & haven't come close to finding it. I've heard a lot about Ian's from many different people, & my husband finally took me to Ian's on Friday. We ordered a large pie w red sauce, fresh mozzarella & fresh basil. The girl taking our order said \"like vegan?\" and we said \"no like a plain cheese pie w fresh basil\" then she said \"fresh basil? uh..we have a spice rack?\" So we just looked at eachother and said \"one large cheese pie.\" What we got, 20mins later, was a pie covered in red sauce with an unmelted ball of cheese on the middle of each slice. I'm still in awe. So many people let this happen...no one stopped and said \"hey? maybe this isn't right?\" that I truly can't believe it. So not only were the employees clueless and rude but they couldn't even make a plain cheese pizza. Disappointing at best."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday when farmers market and maxwell street days were in full swing. Even with the steady stream of customers, they kept the line moving. We got four slices and split among four of us along with a salad and it was plenty!! 
Best slices were pesto spinach, and Mac and cheese. Chorizo sweet potato was a close second. We devoured the melon salad. Couldn't taste the dressing on it but still tasty. We'd come again just for the Mac and cheese pizza though, a whole pie please!!"}
{"text":"The two times I've come here were after long nights on the town. What better way to close off an evening downtown than with pizza? The thin crust pizzas are exactly like how they do it in New York City, so extra points to them for doing it the East Coast way. It tastes not bad - at least I don't have a bad impression of them. But most importantly, it's conveniently located to all the major bars in the area."}
{"text":"They are feeding and supporting protesters. Please donate. Watch You tube view. 
Great job, Ian's pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Yum. Good pizza and lots of interesting choices. Relaxed vibe, plenty of seating and live music."}
{"text":"Ian's can make some incredibly good pizza! Perfect fluffy crust on the edges and crunchy beneath. Primo toppings and a wide variety to choose from. I had the fan-favorite macaroni and personally think the BBQ chicken was much better. But I see the draw, it being Wisconsin and an ample cheesy option. Also, the Florentine did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by Ian's!!  How can you be unhappy with ALL the pizza choices that are not \"run of the mill.\"  Who needs pepperoni pizza when you can have mac and cheese pizza, or Philly cheese steak pizza...and the list goes on??  The newer location is awesome on State Street and of course Frances St. is a handy pop-in location as well.  Ian's is not just for bar time anymore.  Lunch time is a great time to visit Ian's for a break from the work day.  The lunch line is much faster than the bar time line.  Dine in or one for the road.  Bring friends, they'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"They listened to my suggestion! The insides now match the outsides-the bathrooms are now fit for humans! Still 2 stalls and 1 hand dryer but I'm going to presume that's what zoning says is enough. Lightning is nice, stuff appears to work, there's an extra mirror, and there are lockers!

Breadsticks are now more than glorified air! Dense, crispy outside with chewy insides, and a touch of seasoning on the golden outsides to make them appealing.

Best pizza place ever."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison for FAR too long to have never been to Ian's. I've been hearing about the mac and cheese pizza and felt like I was missing out.

I should have listened to all the reviews here on Yelp(...duh). 

The carby concoction is basically a local icon, and I HAD to try it--despite the lackluster response from other Yelpers.  But, everyone is right. It's lacking flavor, and isn't really...well, good. The crust is great, though. Chewy, and just the right thickness. I also tried the slice with tomato, feta, and spinach. Good, but not amazing. 

I wouldn't say no if I was on State and someone wanted to stop, but next time it's a salad(which all looked yummy), and a classic slice."}
{"text":"Defines Madison's A-bar quick eats.  Unique food that tastes good for a cheap price!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! The salad bar is amazing! Pizza options could be better, but it's great pizza!"}
{"text":"Ian's offers a wide array of pizza by the slice. They are located in a former bank building at the upper end of state street just off the capital square.

We stopped in at 1:30  on a busy football Saturday (night game) for a late lunch and tried several of the varieties including BBQ chicken (very good), caprese (just ok), pepperoni (fine) and Mac and cheese (quite bland).

The very slow moving line forms on the right. We spent maybe 15 min in line in part as every customer needed an orientation about the slices available along the counter. Once selections are made, they pop them back into the ovens for a minute or two to warm them (slightly) back up. By the time we reached one of the two cashiers, the pizza was ready.

Want a salad? They have some nice looking salad fixings but to order one you have to know that's a slightly separate line and totally confusing to the uninitiated dining.

Bottom line: confusing and tedious experience for average tasting pizza that comes in a wide variety of flavors.

Most endearing quality: at least it's cheap - 6 slices and 4 sodas were under $30.  

Best for: after bar when taste isn't a critical factor in decision making and you just want something filing."}
{"text":"The best after concert food. What a cool selection! I had the chicken taco pizza and it was exactly what you'd ever want in a taco pizza. Good food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"When they first opened, my mind was blown over the idea of a mac and cheese pizza.  Now, I wouldn't be surprised if Domino's isn't slinging it.  Don't get be wrong, still a solid slice (along with the others) and when intoxicated, a great slice but there is much much better pizza to be had in the Madison area.  I would also agree that the staff, at this location, seem to be more hostile/rude/indifferent that there first location."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Ian's. I use to love it, too, but it gets old. 

I prefer the State Street location to Francis Street. At bar time, the Francis location can have a line out the door and down the block. Some people think it's worth the wait. I'm not one of them.

I'll only eat at State Street because of the salad. They make it right in front of you and they have fresh, local ingredients. My mom loves the mac'n'cheese pizza, but I could live without it. I use to really like the spicy chicken taco, but then I ate it too much. 

Everyone loves Ian's pizza and if you're visiting, I guess it's a place to try, but it's not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who don't care for Ian's--but I'm not one of them and I'll explain why.

Ian's can do pizza the way most people are used to: marinara sauce, shredded mozzarella, traditional toppings like pepperoni, sausage, black olives--you know how it goes.

Or it can do pizza the way pizza was meant to be done: excitingly, exotic, and experimentally. My personal favorite pizza is the Smokey and the Bandit which has BBQ sauce, potatoes, chicken, and ranch dressing. Most of my friends hate this idea, but it is honest to god the best and only pizza I get when I have pizza cravings during finals. But there's also other gems that make Ian's worth a shot: Steak and Fries is solid, and while you're in Madison, the Mac and Cheese is a MUST!

The crust has been criticized by people I know for being too plain, and maybe that is true--but I have no problem with it. The real star of the pizza is the topping and the flavorings, the crust is just a vehicle as far as I'm concerned.

But Ian's has other things than pizza that I love: a friendly staff and delectable, melt-in-your-mouth brownies. And for that, Ian's is one of my Madison favorites."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss most about my old college town, Ian's Pizza.  The cool bars, the good sandwiches and the good vibe of the city are others, but their mac n cheese pizza is right in this list.  Other favorites include the philly cheesteak or the black bean, feta & avacado.

Young and hip staff and typical college pizza place decor.  At bar time, the lines can build up, but the waits usually are not too long.  They always have a ton of pies made and just need to heat up your slice and charge you before you stumble back onto state street with your slice in hand.  I think slices are like $3.50 which is just a killer deal!

A must stop for me every time I am back in town."}
{"text":"Located on State Street, this is an undergrad favorite after a long night out. The pizzas are beautifully shiny and there are a bunch of new specials each day. For $3/4 a slice, I would say it's a little pricey considering the style and quality (in New York you can get the same thing for half the price), but for the area, it's not bad. Service is fast and convenient and I tried the Chorizo and sweet potato pizza (after eyeing the Mac n' Cheese one for awhile). It was pleasant and went well with the barbecue sauce I generously slathered on. Overall it was a good place to go to. Will definitely return after a late night out. P.S. they have punch cards for a free slice every 10!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best pizza in Madison.  They are so creative...who would think of a Mongolian beef pizza or an Italian Meat pizza...???   Amazing creativity and the execution is spot on."}
{"text":"I never met a buffet I didn't like, and I like everything about Ian's. Just having a pizza slice joint is great. One with all these choices is even better.  Queueing up and viewing all of the salad and pizza choices in front of me, I felt like the little kid years ago in the penny candy store, staring, drooling, and unable to make up my mind. The choices are many, and the prices are great, too. That said, instead of choosing a creative pizza slice, I went with a classic pepperoni/mushroom combo. And a coke. Five bucks! Can't beat that for lunch, or a late night snack. Perfect college town vibe, of course, but still a mixed crowd. Fast, friendly and efficient service, by a group of enthusiastic youngsters. Bound to be on my quick and easy lunch list. I think of a Costa Rican buddy would always ask: \"Jew want a piss of pitza?\" Jess, I do!"}
{"text":"Ode to Ian's
A slice of Ian's pizza is huge and delicious
But all the cheese and toppings make it less nutritious
But that's okay, because I'm not a doctor
you wouldn't what to change the methods of the pizza concocter 
From Smoky and the Bandit to Mac and cheese
There is something for everyone that is sure to please
So get in line and try to choose
for which type of pizza are you in the mood

That last rhyme was a little on the slant side, but I think you get the point. Ian's is really good pizza!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, their service is fast, friendly, efficient and affordable. They have so many different flavors that sometimes it is really hard to choose. My personal favorite is the tomato, basil but also the build-your-own is great when in mood for something unique.

I love Ian's long opening hours and affordable prices, this is my go to place when out and about in town late and you are hungry.
I also really like this location as it offers more room than the other location in Madison - on Francis str."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza at a great price! I just wish they had more options like they used to. The Chicken Parmesan pizza was amazing!!  Bring it back!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety and even a vegan friendly pizza where they will make it for you if they don't have any made. 

I had a slo e of the chicken cordon bleu pizza. It had the perfect amount of toppings and tasted delicious. 

Great for groups and they even have an open mic night!"}
{"text":"Service was great. I enjoyed the margarita pizza. That was insanely good.  Great music and good company. The crust was crispy, not burned or super  crunchy. Just right.  The sauce was pretty good and they had an assortment of beverages. The pizza is good for something fast but it wasn't the best.  Huge slices and you pay by the slice."}
{"text":"I love pizza, and there are a lot of great places to get it in Milwaukee, but somebody PLEASE tell Ian to open a store in Brew City!!!  It is bar none the most fantastic pizza I have ever had (including when I at the original thing in Florence and in Naples, Italy, and of course, going 90 miles south to Chicago).  It's a shame I have to go all the way to Madison to get it.  Forget the crazy stuff, like Ian's Mac and Cheese pizza.  Just go for the classic original pies, which are the best pizzas I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Never have I been let down by their vegan pizza! Just the right amount of vegan cheese (not too much!) always give extra toppings when asked for great selection of vegan sauces"}
{"text":"Famous pizza in town. Love their crispy and thin crust plus full of cheese top no matter which flavor you choose. Taste really good. (But salad just fair). Everything is good expect one thing: in terms of how many flavor and pizza option you have it's really depend on when were you come in to store. Unlucky as my bf and me, we only have three options when we in line. Yet when we finish the meal and about to leave the store, we saw there are 7 pizzas in bar for customer to get.....just want to cry that miss the chance to taste the flavor in my list...."}
{"text":"Walking in, you feel confused and extremely hungry for whatever has people waiting in the long line. You walk up and see the chipotle-style salad bar which looks fresh and delicious, but you're here for the pizza. First con- there is no labels to the 20+ types of pizzas you see. However, there is an attentive server that was happy to describe any of the pies before us. You pick one, they throw it in the oven for you, and it comes out very hot and tasty. Only thing is that where you get your pizza is the same place people are trying to get their pop, which gets dangerous. 
I had the spicy buffalo pizza, and it was better than expected. The taste left me impressed and that they get veggies from local farmers? Too cool. Great experience, they just need to have it flow a little better. 4 and 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I love Ian's. Since that first magical slice of mac & cheese pizza at some freshman event in Union South nearly ten years ago, it's been a solid go-to for both dinners and late-night stops. Fresh, local ingredients make for tasty pizzas and awesome salads.

My personal favorite slice is the Steak & Fry, and if you're a meat-eater I recommend opting for the chicken if you do a build-your-own salad  - it's simply seasoned but done perfectly. Also note that the salads are massive - I opted for the large (I was hungry to the point of headache and wasn't sure the $4 small would cut it) and had enough for three meals.

I like the layout of this Ian's location - it lacks the claustrophobia of the Frances location, even on the busiest nights. I used to get a little skeeved out while dining in, as the building formerly housed the adults-only State Street Arcade (hint: you didn't go there to play video games, and the toys were not for children), but now that a few years have passed I no longer fear what may be lurking on the room's surfaces."}
{"text":"I'm sort of a junk food connoisseur, and Ians has long been one of my three favorite pizzerias in the whole US. (Sharing the dais with Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder and Two Boots.) I used to live down the street back in summer '03, and I probably ate here twice a week. I tried everything, and it was almost always amazing. PROTIP: Save your crust for the end, then apply equal parts honey and Frank's Hot Sauce. If it wasn't for the bite marks, you could probably turn around sell this at a fancy Mediterranean bakery for $$$."}
{"text":"I like the specialty pizzas here.  Mac and cheese on a pizza?  Yes, please!  

This is a good place for a quick, cheap bite during a downtown bar crawl although you may wait in line awhile to order.  And finding a table may be tough. 

They have random selections but always a little bit of everything, veggies, brats, pastas...all on pizza.  They have salads and sandwiches too I think but I always ignore those and go straight for the pizza."}
{"text":"Casual spot for creative and delicious pizza.  This is great for pre- and post-bar eating, offering up completely unique pizza flavors for a great price.  The night i was there, we got slices of mac and cheese, shepherds pie, lasagna, Philly cheese steak, and avocado/tomato/feta pizza.  You read correctly, those were all in pizza form, even the lasagna, and they tasted great. Don't expect any frills, as the pizza comes out on paper plates and the whole atmosphere is one of relaxed eating.  But honestly, if you're looking to grab some great pizza and have a beer at the same time, why worry about anything else?"}
{"text":"Such good pizza! Strolled in here for a very late dinner and was very happy with all of the choices available to us. I tried the gyro pizza and it was super delicious. I also appreciated that they had a featured dog of the month at that a portion their proceeds from the Puppy Chow they make goes to the Humane Society."}
{"text":"Ian's is okay.  I mean, I like the crust, and the toppings are good, but it just doesn't knock you out delicious-wise.  I can see it would be great fun for a post-bar stop if you're quasi-drunk, but that's not about tasty food.  I haven't tried the local ice cream they carry.  I want to, but just haven't (quite) justified spending so much for an entire pint, which is more than I'd want to eat.  Soon."}
{"text":"I want to eat a salad at Ian's everyday. I am hooked on the maple vinaigrette. The veggies are always fresh and there is such a wonderful variety. I usually do something along the lines of mixed greens, roasted beets, walnuts, Brussels sprouts, and kalamata olives. Ian's employs a very attractive staff. The restaurant strives to be eco friendly. The women's bathroom really must be visited for the decor. Try to go at off times. Farmer's market Saturday lunches the place is just packed- like can't get in the door packed. I enjoy going on Sundays and mid-afternoon or mid-evening when they aren't as busy."}
{"text":"In town for a conference, super hungry, looking for quick maddy bite. 

I yelped this place and apparently mac n cheese pizza is their creation so I had to try! They had soooo many interesting/yummy looking pies it was super hard to choose from. Two guys behind the counter tried to help quell my indecisiveness- they were basically like if you have never tried the mac n cheese- then get that. 

So I did and I dipped it in their homemade ranch and it was delish. If I were a maddy resident, I would def stop in for a slice on the reg. 

Thanks Ian's! Open a store in SF :)"}
{"text":"I've had pizza all over the country but the mac n' cheese pizza here is the only one I dream about still, I can't even try the other stuff they have cause I love it so much. I have to sleep on a pillow of tissues just to absorb the tears at night since I'm no longer in Madison. They definitely have a secret ingredient in there that makes it so good - I think it's love."}
{"text":"Four stars on Pizza and even the salad.  Great Greek/Med salad with the Mustard Champagne. But man oh man the service is consistently a pain....lately. 

Initially, corporate exceeded expectations about one visit that went far left. No worries. I'm loyal....I like Ian's. The most recent manager....doesn't like it if you order through Campus Foods and made sure to come out and explain this to me. Really! AS he tried to chastise me that I'd save money by ordering directly through Ian's....I had to help him see - \"I'm using a campusfood credit that I won. So I'm saving through CF\" Anywhoo, other incidents lead to the 1 star service rating. Including forgetting my slice, lol. I can laugh now but I didn't then. Omitting simple things but it's good pizza and I'm thrilled about the Vegan option each Monday starting this Dec. 2011. I hope it can stay for a while as I'm pretty shocked I like this Vegan pizza. As I am a carnivore - I won't just eat vegan pizza any ole' place and time. 

1star on service + 4star on pizza = 2.5 avg/mean but cost helps it get 2stars even. Frances just has better service. Yet, State is closer. I love the just cheese slice/the beef with fries & BBQ sauce. The crust and sauce are available for take home purchases. And I will make a special trip just to get the salad here. OMG ... it's great."}
{"text":"It's a true Madison classic for good reason. Unique pizzas by the slice with premium Wisconsin ingredients....the mac n cheese pizza is a MUST. Their salads are also underrated - try the Southwest. Ian's is a \"quick bite\" type of place and the legendary Madison drunk food...so don't expect anything gourmet...just decadent, cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the food, service, atmosphere, everything is done well.  They've such carefully crafted and complex tasting pizzas.  They've high quality ingredients, the pizzas served hot, and even their salads are good.  Their staff is always friendly, greets you at the door, and certainly knows their pizza.  I love their wall art, too.

I'm a well known carnivore and I crave these guys' salad pizza with artichokes, olives, tomatoes, and salad (don't get me wrong, I still get a smokey bandit or BBQ tot...but I rave about a salad pizza to my friends and they're stunned to hear me endorse something vegetarian).  

Definitely one of the places I'll miss the most moving away :("}
{"text":"Ian's was a sight for sore eyes for me after a LONG day in Madison visiting my brother at UW that stated with tailgating, then Badger football, more post-tailgating, and then a mini pub crawl.

It was obviously crowded when our posse rolled in during the wee hours of the morning, but the line moved quick, as the staff is probably used to this type of crowd every weekend. I *believe* I had the BBQ Chicken Pineapple slice, which was huge and rivaled the personal sized deep dish I had in Chicago two days earlier. Like all food I eat early on a weekend morning, it was mind blowing delicious!

The next time I am visiting Madison, Ian's will be on my food agenda, and this time it will be during the daylight (as well as going in the wee morning hours - obviously). A true Madison institution."}
{"text":"Ian's is a staple at bar time but it tastes good ANYTIME!  Most people go right for the Mac n cheese (which is always good) but if you want to venture out the chicken cordon blue and buffalo chicken are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is bland.  The crust is bland.  The cheese is bland.  The ingredients are bland.  Even the macaroni and cheese is bland.  You'd think they'd mix it up when it comes to the toppings, but no-- always the same old pizzas.

Oh, they also have an incredibly annoying sign: \"Our napkins are made from recycled materials.  Please take only as many as you need.\"

Oh really?  I was really considering taking three or four hundred napkins before  I saw that.  Thanks for the helpful reminder, Ian's.  Now why don't you throw out another buffalo chicken pizza that tastes exactly like the spinach pesto which tastes exactly like the portobello which tastes exactly like..."}
{"text":"Late last I wandered into Ian's hoping to find a vegan slice. I had grabbed one there on Monday (spinach, tomatoes, roasted red pepper, penne, & cheeze on top-- deelish) but unfortunately they didn't have any available on Wednesday. I opted for a salad 'cuz I'd seen a couple good reviews and, well, why the hell not. Damn, they know how to build a salad bar. I felt a little like \"that person\" sitting by myself eating salad in a pizza place but it was hearty and hit the spot so whatevahhh!

Ian's does salads like this: choose small (2.50) or large (3.50) with a base of romaine, spring mix, or spinach. Add mix-ins for $.50 or 1.00 including (but not limited to): artichokes, bell peppers, candied pecans, broccoli, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives,  roasted red pepper, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, walnuts, a whole bunch of different cheeses, bacon... I got a nice lookin' pile of greens and proteins for $4.50. Pas mal.

Sometimes you're just in the mood for some good greens and, for a pizza place, Ian's really delivers (pun intended)."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've loved Ian's Pizza since my first Mac and Cheese Slice. They have specialty toppings every month that I try as often as I possibly can and I've never tried one that I didn't love. But, thats the thing, I only ever visited Ian's if I wanted an interesting specialty pizza. Well, recently my love for Ian's went next level when I tried a traditional
Pepperoni slice. I've been scouring Madison for the perfect New York style pizza and always came up empty handed except for two places who were close, but not quite where I wanted them to be. Ian's hits it head on, I never even expected to try a traditional slice here and have it be anything close to NY style, but here I am, salivating while writing this review. Whether you want a traditional New York Style slice or something fun and interesting, you'll find it at Ian's. Get you a pizza place that can do both."}
{"text":"Pizza is just alright but they have a nice setup and some interesting toppings."}
{"text":"After seeing Ian's Pizza featured on Bizarre Foods, we opted to stop in during our stay in Madison to see what all the hype was about. What we learned is that the key to eating here is to go in without any expectations regarding ingredient quality. However, the price and variety are great - they even offer little bags of puppy chow (yum) and organic drinks. Highly recommend to any college student or pizza lover!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing customer service. Needed a pizza delivered for a friends engagement. The pizza was made in the shape of a heart. Congrats was written in pineapple and the masterpiece was finished off with pepperonis to highlight the heart shape. A custom note was written on the inside of the box and the man who helped us could not have been nicer and or more accommodating. Thank you Ian's for an incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Ian's on a balmy winter day while strolling down State Street. 
Highlights & Tips:
-Buffalo Cauliflower (January special) - recommend if you want to try something new. The spicy buffalo sauce balances well against the cauliflower with  blue cheese as the background. Wish there was more cauliflower. 
-Southwest salad - good flavor. Tip: the entree portion is a good size - serves as a side salad for 3. 
-Drinks are well priced. Tip: Fountain soda =  unlimited refills of Sprechers root beer (better deal than Sprechers restaurant! =P
PS. Restrooms are video game-themed and not scary. Make a pit stop during your meal break around the Capital."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a slice after a concert and I have to admit that I wish that all late night spots were as good as this one.  You have a very fairly priced slice of New York stlye pizza with a super crispy crust.  What makes this place unique is the topping options.  I ended up going for the thanksgiving slice.  It was as tasty as it was interesting.  Turkey, stuffing, green beans, crispy onions, gravy and cranberries.  You think all of that suff wouldn't work together but it works so well that it should probably be considered permantely on the menu.

The other slice I went for was the BBQ Chicken Bacon Ranch.  It sounds like too much but it's one of those things that definitely works.  Whenever you go out drinking I start craving things like this and it was an awesome bite."}
{"text":"Gawd. Best morning ever. Waking up and realizing you went to Ian's, and there's still some in the fridge.

I never go to Madison without stopping at Ian's at least once. Unlike others, I've never been a huge fan of the mac 'n' cheese slices. I'd never turn down a bite, but I rarely order a whole slice of it for myself because I find it less interesting than the other flavors. 

I do, however, enjoy anything with roasted red peppers, pesto or olive tapenade, plus all the Mexican ones, steak and fries (with BBQ) and the buffalo chicken. There's always a bunch of sauces and sprinkles (cheese and red pepper) to add to your 'za after you get it, so I spend some time there before finding a seat in the restaurant or on the curb outside.

It's hard to choose, and my college roomie and I were both into sharing, so we I had a system. We would order three slices between the two of us and then have them cut all of them in half. It was legendary, always getting to try three kinds for the price of one and a half. Highly recommended.

This bigger location on State St. seems to run smoothly every time I've been there, and I always get a kick out of the fact that they have Yelp stickers everywhere.

For late-night food, Ian's is as good as it gets... anywhere."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is a creative masterpiece for your palate. They have such interesting and innovative pizza combinations here; I could spend a week trying and falling in love with them all.

As an out-of-towner, my friends brought me here for a lunch break during our jaunt around the Farmer's Market. Was happy to have a nice break in the A/C with unlimited Coca-Cola and tasty pizza. After a lot of decision-making, I opted for the buffalo chicken pizza, which was just as yummy as it sounds. It was a huge slice of heaven.

This place apparently became popular after the protests in the Capitol. Story is that anonymous people donated slices of pizza to protesters, which I think is so neat, and what a way to support your community when they are working hard for a cause! 

Even though it's super popular, it wasn't hard to find a seat (assuming you're okay with sitting on stools). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and would love to come back next time I am in Madison!"}
{"text":"Loved the variety of pizza and variety of beverages, and the prices were just right. Staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great pizza and breadsticks after a night out drinking! Puppy chow was delicious the next day. Fun place to people watch too"}
{"text":"The infamous Ian's Pizza of downtown Madison. They have been filling the bellies of students and party people up late for a very long time. The mac and cheese slice is a popular one, but yhey everything from Philly Cheese steak, eggplant parmesan, steak fajitas, Buffalo chicken with blue cheese, and the classics too. Get here for some unique pizza and they are always open late."}
{"text":"Ian's is a great pizza joint. Its like a cheap version of California Pizza Kitchen, only with good pizza. The place is famous for its mac n' cheese pizza, but the best pizza is the steak and fries pizza. Don't be fooled into thinking that this place is just drunk guy food... this place is great all the time."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place and I admire their creativity.....but(you knew a but was coming) they are really inefficient for large crowds..you have no idea what the special slices of the day are while you are waiting in line..if you did you could decide then..since you dont you wait 434 minutes for a mom to describe all the kinds to her 18 kids...then if it isnt ready after you payed the line to get the pizza coincides with the drink dispense(which by the way has pepsi and coke which is awesome)...pizza was really good..breadsticks were great...all in all if you arent in a lunch time rush I would definitely suggest you check it out."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Mac and cheese pizza is awesome, as is the buffalo chicken.  I just wish it was fresher and actually hot when you got it.  They pop the piece into the oven to reheat each slice, but I swear my pizza has NEVER actually been \"hot.\"  The creativity and taste of the pies make up for it, but by the slice it's just not rave-worthy.  Get a whole pie, however, and it's a whole different story....salads look pretty good too."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Madison in my opinion . They have really unique styles of pizza.

While most people love their Mac-n-cheese pizza my favorite is their steak nacho pizza."}
{"text":"I've only had one pizza here.  I ordered the Margherita for delivery on a Friday night...I wished and I do mean REALLY WISHED I didn't that night.  I was famished and was looking forward to a slice of heaven based on the \"wonderful\" reviews Ian's Pizza has on Yelp, but holy f*uck was it a disaster it turned out to be!!!  Sauce clumsily spread on, mozzarella not even melted, and whole leaves of basil just tossed on without a damn care on the pizza.  There is no way for me to soften the blow to write this review... the pizza I had was an embarrassment to all pizzas ever made."}
{"text":"Awesome late night pizza! Friendly staff, and quick service.

Lots of creative toppings, and nothing is skimped.
I had the gyro pizza and I think some sortof salad pizza. Both were great!
I opted out of the mac and cheese, I need to leave that for next time.

I just wish I stopped by Moes across the street before eating the slices to try duff beer."}
{"text":"Phenomenalllllllllll
I mean to get that mouth-watering piece of pie at 2 am right off the Capitol is bliss!
This is a Madison landmark....even if u r usually not out drinking until the wee hours of morning....u have to visit this place if u live in madison....i would stand by their Barbecue steak and fries or the Philly cheese steak....try the Mac'n'Cheese if u feel especially adventurous!"}
{"text":"There pizza is awesome, and their staff are excellent. Very friendly and great staff, here at this Madison Wisconsin location."}
{"text":"Is everybody crazy?? This may be some of the worst pizza I've ever had. I've seriously had frozen pizza that was better than this. I'm only giving it two stars because a nice guy made us a pretty good salad, but, seriously, the crust was burned, the sauce was flavorless, and the pizza wasn't hot. We tried four different kinds and they were all awful."}
{"text":"Ordered the hamburger and fries pizza by mistake --it wasn't bad!!!  Great place to just grab a quick bite and hang out on the street."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Ian's Pizza a few times, different days, nights etc..... Of all the places Ive eaten pizza and Ive had pizza all over the world...the Pizza I had today at Ian's, BBQ Chicken Pizza was the best pizza I've ever had by far! The lines can be long but worth the wait. Seating can be difficult during busy periods but people rotate in and out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"This Mac n Cheese pizza is insane! The slices are huge and tangy and the crust is even better dipped in the homemade ranch. Came late night with some friends and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for business and have had pizza from the east coast and Chicago. I know my pizza. Stopped in today for a late lunch and was greeted by a very helpful and friendly guy behind the counter. He recommended the new cheeseburger slice. One of the BEST slices of pizza I've ever had. It's on my MUST TRY list! This review can not explain how awesome the food and service was here. If you're hungry for some great pizza, definitely come here!!! These guys do it right and on point!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I've been here in Madison for two weeks now and have had it a few times, both in restaurant and delivery. They heat the pizza up for you and it takes about 10 minutes to get everything. There is a lot of seating but I can see this place getting pretty busy once the bars close down! A lot of drunk people enjoying some pizza I'm sure. :)

I also tried one of their Greek Salads and it was really good! I don't think people usually order salad here, but you know... health.

I know people will suggest the Mac n Cheese Pizza.... But the Mac n Cheese Pizza however was actually my least favourite of the kinds I've tried. It's cheese pizza with macaroni on it. I need more spice in my life than that. I've never really been a fan of plain cheese.

If you're going to try a pizza here I would say try the Papa the Bandit Pizza. It's my fave thus far!

Delivery was fast and easy with the online option."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese pizza please! I always get a slice of this and a new one to try. 2 slices is my max though. If you like them crusty and crispy, just let them know. They'll leave the slice(s) in a little longer for you."}
{"text":"Wow, Ian's ranks with the best pizza I've had in Florence, Rome, Boston, and San Francisco. The crust is perfectly chewy, thin, with a hint of sourdough. I'm fairly picky about pizza crust, and Ian's crust is amazing. 

Toppings range from the fairly traditional to the quirky. Open late. Atmosphere is very much a college hangout--fun in a very casual kind of way. Definitely on my list to come back on my next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"\"Oh my god, I can't believe we walked all the way down here. There was an Ian's right across the street from Wando's. WAHWAHWAH.\"

\"Would you like some whine with that cheese?\" 

\"Actually.. just some MAC and cheese...on my pizza please!\"

Nothing can beat the Cheeseboard pizza from back at home (if you've never heard of the Cheeseboard Co-op in Berkeley California, go look it up, right now!)...but after knocking back a few drinks down the street, Ian's pizza tastes pretty damn good. 
 
I love the crust, but I am not particularly fond of the toppings...I think it mostly has to do with the fact that I'm limited to the vegetarian-friendly options, which basically consists of the pasta pizzas. Seriously, CARB GALORE. 

Ian's is one of those places that you HAVE to try at least once in Madison. I mean, where else are you going to find fritos baked into your pizza?! Once you try it though, the novelty wears off... Still, that doesn't mean that you won't find me there at midnight on a Friday stuffing my face..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison and some of the best I've ever had. You guys nail it every time we order."}
{"text":"Don't order this pizza if you want cheese and toppings! See photo! So disappointed. We spent over 100.00 on 3 large pizzas. They came cold and burnt and no toppings. Never again! Too many other good places to chose from
In Madison."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I usually love Ian's pizza and am frequently a fan after a night out...but today my experience was beyond unacceptable. After waiting in line for 15 minutes the staff informed me that they were out of several of the ingredients needed for the salad I had been eyeing the entire wait. Okay, no problem. I quickly decided on another option and was subsequently told that they were also out of that dressing. Fine. A staff member helped me pick an alternative and I continued on to the register to wait. 

After receiving my salad ten minutes later, we took our food outside to eat. When I opened up the box, I found several partially-live BLACK BEETLES in my meal. When I took the salad inside to complain, the staff member working at the register did not seem phased. While he immediately issued me a refund and offered to remake the salad, I was so unsettled with the overall experience that I left and ate elsewhere. 

I have never questioned the quality of ingredients at Ian's, but this experience has definitely made me rethink eating there. I can handle the lengthy wait and limited menu, but not the live bugs crawling in my food."}
{"text":"Ian's is fun, they make all sorts of crazy pizzas. The mac and cheese pizza is a good one to eat after drinking a few beers on state street. When in Wisconsin right?

My colleagues all enjoyed eating Ians frequently and I found myself gravitating towards their pepperoni pizza, which is delicious. I've also heard the salads are really good, I wanted to try one when I lived in Madison but it was to hard to resist the pizza temptations. :P"}
{"text":"Really good pizza! They had a lot interesting pizzas. I didn't try the mac-n-cheese pizza, but a few friends did and were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"can i admit something to you?

i was more impressed with their build-your-own salad than their famous mac-n-cheese pizza.

do you still love me?




but i am still definitely eager to try their other weird specialty slices."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison.  Not your traditional style pizza but don't worry they always have plenty of plain cheese slices available.  Ian and his entire staff are the nicest people in the world.  They always use really fresh and local ingredients for the pizza too.  Service is quick, delivery is reliable and the pizza is awesome.  Favorites are chicken penne alfredo, mac and cheese (their top seller) and steak & fries.  Don't be afraid that the slices don't sound appealing.  I promise if you try it you will like it.  The prices are reasonable and they're open late too.  Best thing to happen to Madison along with the Kohl Center."}
{"text":"They have great Mac & Cheese pizza and that toatlly got me hooked! This is a must go place anytime you are in Madison and they are open late. Plus there is plenty of seating indoor and out. Go there and have a great plizza slice experience!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ian's Pizza -- perfectly thin, crispy, chewy crust and always-amazing toppings. Their salads are fantastic, too!  MY ONLY complaint other than that they don't deliver to the west side, (*disclaimer -- I haven't been to Ian's new State St. location, so this may have changed) is that they don't post what's on the pizzas.  It's always a bit of a harried situation ordering: everything looks SO good! But I want to know what's on each pizza.  I don't see why it would be so difficult to type up and laminate the ingredients of each pizza and post them at the counter.  Seems to me it would save the servers the hassle of explaining each pizza over. and over. and over again.  Just my two cents.  Love the 'za, great work!"}
{"text":"Really good and an exceptional price! Large salads are huge."}
{"text":"Ok, I went to college at UW, and since graduating I have lived in Chicago for 5 years. In that time, I have had a lot of great pizza. However, Ian's has the most special place in my heart. 

Ian's is amazing at all hours of the day - after several long islands at the Plaza, for a quick dinner on a weeknight, or reheated the next day for breakfast. Their crust is perfect. It's crunchy, chewy, and soft all at the same time. Their toppings are extraordinary. Obviously, their are the favorites like mac n' cheese, but other creative options like sweet potato chorizo should not be overlooked. 

Ian's cannot disappoint me. I will wait in the line. I will wait to pay. I even waited in line behind 50 high school students visiting Madison on a field trip. I don't care. Just give me the pizza. Oh, and they have salad."}
{"text":"I feel a 4-star review is fair for this pizza place. They put a sweet twist on your usual NY slice and they do a great job with it. The flavors are definitely there, and the atmosphere is great besides the lack of beer. I will definitely be back to this spot the next time I am in town. There are so many different pizza combinations, and they all leave you dying to try the next one. Plus, the pricing isn't anything crazy. I think it was only $4 a slice and you'll be stuffed after just two slices. Give this place a go if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is a local favorite for many Madisonians. Their pizza options range from classic pepperoni & sausage to odd slices such as macaroni & cheese, chicken fajita, or buffalo chicken. The macaroni and cheese pizza is a personal favorite, but there is likely a type of slice for anyone who comes to visit (they even offer vegan options!!) Pizzas can be bought by the pie, but most people get one or two slices at a time since one slice is HUGE. 

If you're not a fan of pizza, Ian's also offers a great salad bar. Their lunch special with their salad bar is awesome and offers a large range of options. 

Visiting Ian's on the late weekend nights, lunch hours, or dinner times will cost you some time. They have an online ordering service if you do not feel like waiting in line, but it only delivers to specific areas (if you're visiting from downtown you should be fine!)."}
{"text":"I have an emotional and nostalgic fondness for this pizza.  It reminds me of being freezing cold but full of hope, buoyed by the feelings of solidarity in the Madison protests.  Supporters of public education and union rights from around the world ordered pizzas for us, from here.  Maybe this enables me to overlook that the place is actually kind of dumpy, not very convenient unless you're walking, and generally full of young drunken idiots late weekend nights.  The pizza is pretty good though, there's a wide selection of toppings (some are pretty ridiculous) on pizza slices, displayed behind the counter.  You can see how fresh each pizza is, fresher is better than the exact ingredient combination you may have had in mind.  I think you're better off ordering ahead and picking up, there's nothing special about sitting down and eating here, unless you want to be surrounded by  intoxicated college students.  Being a college professor, this is how I envision Purgatory.  Of course it's more pleasant afternoons and weekday evenings.  It's a New York style flat, chewy thin crust pizza you can (well you have to) fold to eat."}
{"text":"$3 for a slice of amazing, thin crust pizza! I loved this place! As soon as we walked in the employee greeted us and told us about the different kinds of pizzas. Some are very normal (cheese and pepperoni, for example) while others are much more exotic (i.e. the mac and cheese pizza). I ordered the tomato, basil, mozzarella, which was fantastic!!!  I enjoyed every bite. Will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PIZZA PLACE! Absolutely delicious pizza. My favorite so far is the \"Smokey the Bandit\" pizza: BBQ sauce, chicken, mozzarella, bacon, cheddar, and ranch. Thin crust with a crispy \"wall.\" SO AMAZING!!!! Bravo, Ian's! Will definitely keep visiting and trying more of your pizzas!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't normally give 2 stars but given all the hype, I was disappointed.Being new to Madison, people kept telling me that Ian's makes some of the best pizza in town. I tried Glass Nickel and thought it was decent, so I expected Ian's to be amazing.

If you're looking for novelty pizzas, then this is a place to check out. Mac and cheese pizza, chicken alfredo pizza, barbeque pizza. I tried the portabella pizza and it was ok. It didn't have a ton of flavor, pretty greasy, the sauce was almost nonexistent, and the crust was meh. My roommate seemed to like her mac and cheese pizza. I tried a bite and it was ok. 

Next time I have a craving for pizza, I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ian's is my second favorite place in downtown Madison to get a giant piece of Mac & Cheese pizza. Which isn't saying much since there are only 2 places.

However, they do have decent pizza and it's not totally overpriced. Just a bit. I will only order Ian's delivered, because going into the restaurant on State Street is a complete nightmare. I have done it at 2 am and and 3 pm and lots of times in between and it is always hot, crowded, and completely unorganized. They aren't very fast either.

The Mac & Cheese pizza is good. Not the best, but it's good. I will say that the little bags of Puppy Chow are the only reason that I ever go here instead of the #1 giant slice of pizza place - Pizza di Roma.

I've never had an excellent experience here and their delivery also takes FOREVER.

But hey, it's convenient and it's good so if you're desperate for pizza and you can't walk a little ways down State for a REALLY good slice, go to Ian's."}
{"text":"I've had good and meh experiences here.

The service is always friendly, but often seem kind of frazzled.

I don't get the mac and cheese pizza at ALL. I think it's super bland. Their vegetarian options are also usually a little one note -- some sort of blend of tomato/pesto/cheese flavor. I'd love more veggie-heavy but interesting dishes.

The main thing I've come to like is the Southwest Salad. I started an internship on the square so on Tuesdays I head in .. and nearly every week they've been out of something for the salad! I got it as a whole ONCE in the past 5 weeks or so. I told my co-worker how yummy it was, she went to try it out, they were out of everything, and she got another salad ... and hated it. Haha. Come on!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Mac n' Cheese
Pork Sausage with Marinara with Mozzarella

As much an icon as any other dining establishment in Madison it was directly from Graze that I walked to 100 State Street and although already plenty saturated with cheese the legend of Ian's Pizza quickly drew me in, only a few college kids filling the lively space at an off-hour while the service team bustled behind a long counter of pies and salads set before a kitchen where gas ovens gleamed.  Large in size with pop-art styling provided by local artists and a promise to source locally as best as they can it was to a wide variety of pizzas-by-the-slice that my eyes immediately widened on approach and having heard rumors of their mac n' cheese I quickly ordered a slice alongside one topped with marinara and mozzarella plus spicy sausage so that I might, too, try the red sauce.  Reheated to order and served on paper plates much like any number of pizzerias back east it was perhaps ten minutes after paying the $8 tab that my order was up and taking a seat at one of the low, wooden tables I began with the signature, each cheddar-laden elbow noodle rendered just a touch chewy by the oven providing an excellent textural contrast to the crispy, charred crust.  A bit less inspired by marinara that trended just a touch to sweet yet impressed by both the locally sourced sausage and mild, creamy mozz it was after only a few bites that I turned back to the macaroni and finishing the slice while leaving the rest of the other behind in order to save stomach space my curiosity was satisfied - were Ian's in any number of US Cities it would undoubtedly be equally well praised as the best \"New York Slice\" in town."}
{"text":"Unique pizza places with pizza by the slice! Had a good mac and cheese pizza, very different than your usual, def worth trying! Very good deal, not expensive! My husband had the bbq chicken which he loved! Also had the breadsticks which were okay, but good pablano ranch sauce! Would come again for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you would expect if Pizza and crack had a baby.  Oh man was it good... especially late at night.  The taco pizza was amazing.  Buffalo and mac n Cheese was solid too.  Location is nice and convenient and they are open late.  Totally will go back."}
{"text":"Nothing like craving pizza at midnight and coming here. Great service and delicious pizza! Love the variety and good prices."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select=jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw

I could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. 

So glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus."}
{"text":"I'm pretty excited about this place since I live in Milwaukee now. It's much larger than the two I know of in Milwaukee. How much larger you ask?
Well for starters this place has a full salad bar! Not DIY situation but a pick or build kind of deal. Very cool.
The salad was good!
The pizza is of course awesome and this time around I had a spicy chorizo, potato, cheese, onion situation. It was like a taco. 
The hot sauce isn't my favorite as it's more like wing sauce or something but nice when you need that little extra hiccup in your giddyup. 
The seating area is pretty huge too and that's a nice change. If you know and love the smaller locations then this is the place to stop to get a taste of the extra huge pizza place. 
In short, Ian's' good."}
{"text":"It's pretty good! I think it's $3 for one slice. So much pizza to choose from and you can have a salad with your pizza too which is very good! Staff are friendly. Love the hours"}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is just fabulous.  It is not fine dining but who needs that when the slices taste THIS GREAT!  The flavors of the pizza slices are inventive, fresh, and always tasty.  There is always something new to try if you are adventurous.  But they keep the classic Ian choices available, too.  Anyone who hasn't tried the Mac and Cheese or the Steak & Fry pizzas does not know what they are missing!

The State Street location is a big comfortable space.  Ian's staff have nailed customer service every time I have walked in.  I had brought some out of towners to Ian's on State this summer and the staff took their time describing all the pies to my pals.  My pals were extremely pleased with their experience.   One friend is from the Seattle area.  She is hopeful that the Seattle Ian's opens very soon!

Ian's continues to be one of my favorite places in Madison for a quick and affordable meal before a sports event or concert downtown.  Yay Ian's!"}
{"text":"I agree with one of the reviewers that they are recognized for their unusual pizza rather than the quality. I've been here only a couple times - and just did this past month.  With a line almost out the door during lunch hour, I thought I'd be pleased with my pizza.  However, the opposite occurred.

The mac and cheese wasn't anything spectacular, pretty bland and not cheesy (I mean, no stringy cheese falling down my face with the bite).  I can't remember the name of the pizza I ordered, it had buffalo chicken on it...yikes, it was not good, I think it was sitting around for the whole morning after being made. 

I would love to give Ian's a good review - but it's all talk and no taste."}
{"text":"A staple of Dairyland's Capitol and a can't-miss for pizza lovers. Don't expect cheese and pepperoni, and they are not known for their fluffy crust. Think more of a carb-heavy creation like mac & cheese topped pizza. Yum!

Grab a slice to go and take a stroll around the Capitol. It's a Mad City must!"}
{"text":"I was amazed at this place. I love mac and cheese and I love pizza. They combined the two and won me over. BBQ chicken was amaze balls too. THE BEST pizza I've had in awhile. Thanks Ian's! Also try their fresh salads!"}
{"text":"I get it. Ordered a pizza and bread at close to bar close. Ian's is the worst experience I've ever had. I wish I had a 2.99 Geno's pizza. Couldn't even cut the pie. I didn't expect much from Ian's this late. But I did laugh when you were way worse then what I expected."}
{"text":"I don't know if there is any Madison staple I will miss as much as Ian's when I move to Illinois. I have been countless times. I always get two slices - it is a hearty amount of food for $8. My absolute favorite is the Cheesy Potato with Ranch. It is addictive! I think my other favorite is called Smokey the Bandit (BBQ chicken and cheese). Obviously the Mac n' Cheese is a classic, but I usually don't choose it because I have so many other favorites with a bit more flavor. They always have a good one on special - most recently I tried a seafood alfredo slice. Although most people don't go for the salads, they have a surprisingly delicious build-your-own salad that tastes fresh. I always top it with the White Balsamic and Herb Vinaigrette. Finally, they sell Calliope's pints there, and who doesn't love Calliope's? I LOVE Ian's."}
{"text":"This place offers some to of the craziest pizza ideas that you won't see anywhere else.  They offer a great selection of choices, plus a few that you wouldn't have created your self.  Kids and wife love their Mac&Cheese version.  The ambience is more on the hipster side.  Lot of the college students are here.  Seating is inside and out.  If they don't have it, they will make it."}
{"text":"They have so many choices every day! The Mac and cheese is their most famous, but I personally like others more! The traditional ones also taste very good."}
{"text":"Fast, fun, cheap, and tasty! I tried the mac n cheese and the brisket slices, both were great and the mac n cheese was especially delicious. Great for a low key dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Dropped by to get some pizza to-go for a lunch by the lake. The service was great. The girl at the counter was helpful and friendly. She provided 2 huge takeout pizza boxes and heated up our slices in their oven before putting them in the takeout boxes, so the pizza was warm and luscious. 

We got 17 slices of basically all the types of pizza they had available, of which I ended up eating one: the mac and cheese pizza. Delicious. The pasta was so soft and nicely baked into the cheese that I barely noticed it. Surprisingly, one slice was enough for me to be totally full by the end! Great pizza. Everyone else in the party enjoyed theirs as well. I heard their corned beef is especially good."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is definitely one of the most tastiest local pizza restaurant with lots of amazing combinations. My to-go-favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza which I almost get every single time. 

The long line can be daunting but it definitely moves quickly and before you know it, you're biting into delicious pizza (or make your own salad). There's a hidden cooler underneath the cash register and Ian has IZZE's in stock here. 

The pizza is definitely better tasting when it's fresh and toasty, right out of the oven. So eat the pizza while it's still warm!"}
{"text":"3 stars when sober and 5 at bar time. Their selection of crazy pizzas is great and the new salad bar looked amazing. I prefer the lasagna pizza from Pizza De Roma but Ian's is a close second and always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise! Ian's has lots of vegan options, just ask! This location is specifically by the slice. I didn't see anything in the lineup that looked vegan, so I asked and they said they would get one going right away, and even gave me first dibs on the slices. It was portobello, spinach, and roasted red pepper on red (awesome) sauce with daiya vegan cheese. I saw they also have vegan pesto as a sauce option, so I asked and they were able to give me a side cup of it which I smeared all over my slices."}
{"text":"Do I think $4 is too much for a slice of pizza? Yes. But is it really tasty? Also yes.

Ian's is the go-to late night pizza place in Madison and always has a line out the door starting around midnight. Their signature is mac and cheese pizza and WOW, is that good. Another bonus? They have homemade ranch. And that's also pretty GD good.

They do offer rotating specials that they advertise on the sandwich board outside. That's cool! They also always have a vegan option, although last time I was in they didn't have any slices left and it was only available to buy a whole pie. 

Don't forget your punch card if you go!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I thought the pizza was totally weak compared to what I'm used to. But I think it is awesome that they supported the protesters and that they delivered late at night right to my hotel room."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Mesa Pizza out in Iowa City. It is very similar in taste, size, and variety. Total drunk people food but it's solid. Got a couple of pepperoni slices (pretty damn good size for $3 a piece) last night on my way back to my friend's place and I'd definitely stop back at Ian's when I'm in Madison again."}
{"text":"The pizza is reasonably priced, the service fast, and even the salads can be worth the trip.

This location tends to have a bit more upscale clientele than the one on Frances St. They do a good lunchtime business, and I have been in here a few times for that purpose. Sometimes I get a slice or two, but their salads made to order are also a good bet. You can get a wide variety of items in your salad, and a large selection of different dressings are available as well.

The standard pizza slices, like a pepperoni and sausage are excellent, but I sometimes go for the philly steak, which is delicious. My friends swear by the mac and cheese pizza, but that really is not my bag."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Ian's! One of my favorite places to grab dinner on campus. You can't go wrong with a slice of their famous mac n cheese pizza, although, there are many other delicious flavors to choose from as well. They don't label all the flavors in the restaurant, so instead of holding up the line asking what every single kind it (it will take forever to go through!) look online and plan ahead if you're a newcomer. 
Specialty slices are $4 a piece and regular (cheese, pepperoni and sausage) are $3. I am more than okay with the prices. They used to be $3 and $2 respectively but they decided to increase their workers pay to $10 an hour and they did that by increasing the slices price by $1. I'm more than okay with that idea and I applaud that they value they're workers but also let the community know of the change. 
It can get busy during the night on weekends but most times the line goes quick and it's an easy in and out. 
The salads are also very tasty and fresh. I frequently grab one on the side but I wouldn't go out of my way just to come for only getting a  salad."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza for breakfast is now a thing and it's amazing.

I love oatmeal and I love Ian's Pizza, but I never thought I'd be eating oatmeal at Ian's Pizza. Indeed, this is what went down this weekend as Ian's opened shop bright and early to introduce to the world their take on breakfast. With a steel-cut oatmeal and yogurt parfait bar, along with nine breakfast pizza options, late night destination Ian's Pizza crosses into new territory as a new destination for the early birds among us.

Given Ian's Pizza's affinity for concocting wacky flavor combinations, the intrigue was high for what ingredient pairings would make up their nine breakfast pies. On the day of the breakfast launch, workers were spinning out Denver Omelets, Huevos Rancheros, and Chorizo or Roasted Vegetable Hash, all manifested onto a pizza. With such a loyal adherence to classic breakfast fare, a trip to Ian's in the morning will be just as tasty as or even better than the typical Saturday brunch. And Ian's hasn't forgotten the folks who crave an injection of something sugary for their morning fix. One slice of the sweet Apple Cobbler pizza later and you will forget your usual syrup soaked pancake or French toast needs. 

The Sweet Potato & Kale pie that I indulged in in my visit to this momentous occasion, left me already declaring Ian's breakfast my new Saturday morning ritual. From the trusty crispness of Ian's crust to the generous layer of cheese, and flavorful additions of sweet potato and seasoned kale, this was a smashing pie. While they're only serving breakfast on Saturdays from 7am-11am, I decided that yes, I will wake up for this.

On top of the hearty handful of creative pizza varieties, Ian's is also looking out for those with the more traditional breakfast options on the mind. They've transformed their salad bar into the oatmeal and yogurt station of your dreams. With over 15 topping options, the likes of granola, dried and fresh fruit, and a handful of different nuts, the flavor combos are endless. If you're like me and lacking the creativity this early in the a.m., Ian's will set you up with one of their signature favorites. With a base of Sugar River Dairy yogurt and house-made oats, you really can't go wrong. 

And however delicious the pizzas are, 'The Mifflin' Oatmeal that I feasted on was what really had me swooning. In this signature flavor, Ian's steel-cut oats are topped off with honey, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, dried cherries, a splash of almond milk and, wait for it, chocolate chips. The heartiness of the oats acted as the perfect base for this delicious party of ingredients. The almond milk and honey added a delicate sweetness, the strawberries contributed a refreshing taste, and the crunch of the coconut and chewy bite of cherries were both just right. Add a sprinkling of melty, rich chocolate chips to this already beautiful (and ginormous) bowl and you are sitting in oatmeal heaven. 

Thank goodness Ian's has decided to team up with Just Coffee Cooperative for their breakfast days. This is coffee so great that even sugary latte addicts will prefer to drink it black. Though I am far from a dedicated coffee drinker, I'm able to fall in love with and easily drink a black cup of Just Coffee Cooperative's brews time and time again. There is no bitterness to these roasts and it is amazing. 

The coffee, the oats, the yogurt, and the pies, Ian's you've done good."}
{"text":"I drove across town on a hot tip from my brother.  He said I had to at least get a slice of mac-n-cheese pizza, but that I should also try others.  On my first trip, I had the mac-n-cheese and the specialty BBQ pulled pork.  Both of these slices were just down right delicious!  The thin crust was crispy and the toppings were abundant.  The second time I went, I had the Chicken cordon blue and a chicken penne pasta... both delightful slices.  When I had to opportunity to go with my brother, he said that he chooses his pizza by picking the most colorful pie.  I found that to be unique and helpful advice.  They have 10oz plastic cups and a water dispenser for free beverage.  They also offer other drinks from the cooler.  I enjoyed seeing the sign that bragged about the biodegradable pizza boxes.  Truly a unique pizza joint."}
{"text":"Their Macaroni Pizza is legendary for a reason. With unique pizza flavors Ian's is sure to soothe you pizza cravings. If you come to Madison make sure to hit up this restaurant, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not a fan of the regular old pizza joint slice, but I'll bite on the gimmicky ones to try it once. Huge slice of mac and cheese pizza fed my fiance and I both for lunch, and another one to go for later. I might also try the BBQ chicken ranch or the other specialties if I were looking for something fast and relatively inexpensive (~$4/slice/special)."}
{"text":"A great place for a cheap lunch or late night snake.  Fun environment and is packed at bar close.  They have unique selections of pizza.  I would recommend the Philly cheesesteak or the chicken bacon barbecue ranch.  Make sure to try their homemade ranch and get a punch card!"}
{"text":"This pizza is phenomenal. Crust is thin but substantial. Sauce is tangy and delicious. Cheese is melted to perfection, and the variety of toppings is impressive. Smokey and the Bandit is a favorite, as is the Chicken Bacon Ranch. The macaroni and cheese pizza is also classic, so get it while you have the chance! It has a subtle white sauce that complements but does not overwhelm the macaroni. Great pizza place!"}
{"text":"The waiter/server is always nice. As I can't have some pork or pepperoni, they will nicely suggest some chicken only pizza. So far, I've always had good experience with this place."}
{"text":"I'd say Ian's is recognized more for their unconventional pizza ideas than the actual quality of the pizza. I got the mac and cheese pizza which was pretty much, um.. mac and cheese.. on pizza (try not to envy my way with words). I actually expected it to be a little cheesier though, but it was pretty flat. There was a burrito pizza that I was almost tempted to try, had I not glanced a tiny hair on one of the slices.

In my opinion, definitely worth a try but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Interesting pizza place extremely similar to other pizza places i've been two in the Illinois and Iowa campuses. I ask for my pizza to be extra crispy so I get the hot, crunchy texture. Always a great meal for quick/cheap purposes."}
{"text":"I adore Ian's Pizza. This causal pizzeria is fast, efficient, affordable and delicious. They have \"wild and crazy\" favors for the adventuresome foodie (e.g. Smoked Brisket and Tots pizza, Mac & Cheese, Chipotle Sweet Potato, Veggie Curry) and their classics are simply delicious (tomato pesto and cheese). If the toppings weren't a good enough a reason to stop here, their \"twice baked crust\" (i.e. they toast up your slice after you order it) is wonderful. Their salad bar is a great option and many of their ingredients are local and organic. A few notes for those who have not eaten here before-its by the slice unless you order a full pizza ahead of time. It's possible your favorite favor maybe gone by the time it's your turn at the counter but ask them about a slice of you don't see it, they have fresh pizzas cooking in the back, which maybe what you're looking for! Also the line moves quickly, so don't be discouraged if the line is out the door when you arrive. On average (could vary) it's about a 10-15 min wait to order if the line is out the door."}
{"text":"We decided on Ian's after the Homecoming parade. The line was quite long, but they keep things moving right along and we were choosing our slices in no time. We bypassed the salad bar, but I will definitely give it a try next time. All ingredients looked fresh and they had some interesting seasonal salads. We each had a piece of the southwestern and my dining partner also had a piece with BBQ brisket and tater tots. It is a huge slice, so one is enough for me. I love the crust! Crispy but chewy at the same time, and so many fun combinations to try. All of the people that work there are friendly and very helpful in explaining different slices. Maybe I missed this, but I wish they would label slices so you can get an idea of what they are. Also, if they could keep up on wiping off tables before the next people sit down, that would make it darn near perfect. $13 for 3 slices and a soft drink. Not bad, thanks Ian's!"}
{"text":"Best specialty pizza in Madison. Hands down. Their Mac and cheese pizza is perfect for any mood or craving and their delivery is quick and prompt as well."}
{"text":"I ate here while on a tour because every damn person we met said we had to come here. Eventually we did and it was good. There were some gutter punks eating a slice on the sidewalk and they fell off their skateboard as they rode away. There was also some weird guy riding a segway and talking on a bluetooth. Both of these things happened while we ate our pizza and they didn't take away from the fact that we enjoyed our pizza."}
{"text":"Occassion: Dinner with friends, touring Madison
Food: bbq chicken pizza, mac and cheese pizza
Thoughts: Love the unique selection of pizza. Taste of pizza was ok. Namely, the mac and cheese was bland - not enough cheese. Portion was solid; however, I felt $4/slice did not justify the quality of the pizza slices I had."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Ian's for years. I love, love, love the selection! 

The staff has always been friendly. The pizza has always been high quality. There's really nothing to complain about! Even on the busiest of occasions the wait time has been minimal. I love the new restaurant space, too. Great upgrade! 

Brisket and tots is crazy delish, probably my favorite. 

Slices are big and worth the charge, which isn't high at all to begin with. Overall, everything about this place is and always has been a big WIN in my book."}
{"text":"This place had my teenage son, aka \"garbage disposal\" drooling in envy over the fact I didn't take him here.  When you walk into Eans you weave through your line like you are at Disneyland, and it feels almost as magical. 

You then arrive at the magical pizza line, giant slices of different toppings.  Mac and Cheese, BBQ chicken, French fries, artichoke and spinach, sausage and pepperoni, and any other topping you can imagine on a pizza in fun combinations.  The staff is very friendly and identifies those pizza slices that look amazing, but you aren't entirely sure what is on them.  There is enough choices to make sure everyone in your party could choose one.

Best off is the price.  Seriously, it is tough to find a fun and affordable place to eat.  A giant slice of pizza and a soda was $5 and change.  It was delicious too!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing salad with fresh local ingredients. My husband had the pizza and thought it was great!  The unique toppings like mac n cheese or potato and cheddar make this an interesting place to visit.  We thought the line could be managed more efficiently.  The pizzas are not labeled, so you have to ask what everything is.  The pizza pick up clogged the drink station and vice versa.  Good food, great concept!"}
