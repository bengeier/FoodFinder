{"text":"Shoubu Sushi has now been sold to new owners who have unfortunately cheapened the experience.  Most of the dishes that made Shoubu a standout restaurant are now gone.  The individual sushi pieces have been made significantly smaller while the prices have remained the same.  There is also a new chef whose skills leave a lot to be desired (some sushi pieces are mis-formed, others are missing key ingredients (like salmon in the spicy salmon roll).  I would not recommend returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"A great local sushi place, used to be Tokyo Sushi which was also excellent. I have only been here once so far and ordered take-out, Dynamite Roll & Edamame. I was led to a seat to wait for my order which was prepared surprisingly quickly. The staff are all very friendly, and the sushi was delicious. Will definitely be going back.  As mentioned, this restaurant was previously Tokyo Sushi, with had private booths. Shoubu has renovated and gotten rid of the booths, opening up the small restaurant quite a bit. Decor is modern, and restaurant is clean. Food is very fresh."}
{"text":"2.5 star   Shoubu Japanese Restaurant is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant that serves both Japanese and Korean cuisine.   They do have lunch specials till 3 pm for $10 and up which includes a salad and a miso soup.   Sushi Platter ($11) - Mixed Spring Salad was nicely presented and with a light dressing, which I found it was a step up from other places I been +0.5  - The sushi was a little disappointing. Since the fish was thinly cut and there was no wasabi inside the sushi itself!!  - I just so not used to having sushi that does not have wasabi inside, personally for good sushi, the amount of wasabi should be decide by the sushi chef depends on what kind of fish and to the proportion of rice  - Fish selection is a little boring mostly Salmon...  - The California Roll was nicely done   Shoubu Japanese Restaurant though small but nicely decorated. But I don't think i will be back for their sushi... maybe for other Korean dishes?   They accept Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
