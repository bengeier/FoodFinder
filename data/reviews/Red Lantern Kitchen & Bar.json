{"text":"Quietly the best spot to eat in Kamms corner. Great food Great service the presentation is awesome .. You have to check it out !!"}
{"text":"This place is medicore at best. Garbage food, garbage service and exspensive beer. You are better off getting a frozen pizza and a six pack of PBR, at least you will be satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"Great place to be, eat, and drink. Atmosphere is fantastic. Definitely a place to visit in the Kamms Corner area. Don't judge the strip mall location."}
{"text":"We had awful service no one checked back to make sure everything was ok we waited an hour and a half for our food 20 mins for a drink"}
{"text":"We are never disappointed when we stop in at the Red Latern.  Their lunch and dinner menus are both exceptional.  Their spirits line up is very imaginative and yummy.  Always a great choice."}
{"text":"Relaxed and classy atmosphere.  Fresh look and great eats.  Lunch orders were quickly taken and service was very attentive.  Pear salad was a perfect pair of sweet and savory.  Interesting and delicious take on fish dishes, as well.  A great addition to Kamms.  Happy to enjoy a meal with my father and have such a pleasant place to visit."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in the kammz area.  I tried this place out when it first opened and wasn't a huge fan, however I did give it a second chance and boy am I glad I did! The decor is very modern and I really like the pictures of West Park all over the walls- it feels like home.  Their Sunday brunch and bloody Mary bar was very refreshing.  Steak and eggs delicious as were the potato pancakes!  I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Went on the spur of the moment on Friday; they happened to be showing the quarter finals of the high school state football championship, two local high schools with a LONG history of rivalry. Place was PACKED.  Because of that, the dinner service was slower than normal, but we were informed of that before we chose to sit down which was extremely nice.  Dinner was PHENOMENAL.  Grilled pork chop with peach sauce, mashed potatoes, green beans.  Wait staff were extremely pleasant and apologetic for the wait, but as I said, they informed us at walk in, so it was our choice.  I've been before for brunch and was pleased, but this dinner was  truly tasty.  I'd rather wait and let them get it right than have the kitchen rush and get it wrong."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I came here and was never served so the rating is for the service only. Maybe the food is good but I will never know because I won't be back. They have no host so you seat yourself and hope that someone remembers what order you arrived in. We sat and waited and the server skipped us numerous times. We wanted to stop somewhere for a quick lunch near the hospital so if that is your goal As well I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite after work stop! The staff is always friendly and the food is always amazing! The bartenders are very creative and have fresh fruit and herbs to handcraft the most delicious cocktails!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  The management there is terrible and was charged for food the server put in by mistake.  Management refused to remove from bill.  The item that was brought out by mistake was never touched and was left on table."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, really strong drinks and a Bloody Mary bar. Add in great prices and nice presentation and super clean, neat restaurant - and we will definitely be back! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try their new menu, unfortunately the service and the food was not so exciting. Dined on a Thursday night after leaving the gym, was happy to see that we must have missed the dinner rush because the restaurant was practically empty. Took quite a while for our server to great us, I actually was considering leaving the restaurant and picking someplace else, but my son talked me into staying because the Cavs game was on. We quickly made our dinner selections and ordered. I picked the salmon burger and he picked a pepperoni kids pizza. The food took 34 minutes to make it to the table once ordered, we both were underwhelmed. The best thing about the salmon burger was the bun, the actual burger was cold and the lemon sauce that it came with tasted like sour mayo. The kids pizza was doughy in the middle and cheese hardly melted. I remember going to the original Red Lantern when I was a kid with my parents and it was the perfect neighborhood dive spot. Seems like the new Red Lantern is trying too hard in a neighborhood that is much more laid back. I would suggest sticking to the basics and doing them well."}
{"text":"Just finished brunch, and we were a little disappointed with it. The food has great flavor and the atmosphere is pleasant. As for the quality it's in need of some improvement. Our eggs in the hash were over cooked and the corned beef was chopped lunchmeat, even though I asked if the corned beef hash was homemade. Also ordered the potato pancakes, which were bland. It was a fair experience, will try dinner another time to see if any better."}
{"text":"I went here for a monthly dinner with my friend, and I really liked it. I had been there for a happy hour before after work (I work right down the road). The restaurant does not really stick out since it is in the shopping plaza, so it is easy to miss. But you definitely do not want to miss out on this place.   The service was a little slow, but the waitress was also the bartender and there was a rush of people all at once, so it was easy to see how she could be overwhelmed easily. We did not get drinks, even though I have had delicious drinks there before. I got the seasonal ravioli, which was some sort of veggie puree inside of the ravioli with a soy-sauce like sauce on it. It was delicious. We also split the eggplant dip as an appetizer - which it did not look the best, but was tasted way better (first impressions are not everything)."}
{"text":"Two Words- HAPPY HOUR!  I would highly suggest coming here for Happy Hour! $5 for any Flatbread, Burger and Appetizers!! They also have select $5 martini's, $3 craft beers, $2.50 imports and $2 domestics. You cannot get a better deal anywhere else!  I have come to this place for both Lunch and Dinner. The service was much much better during dinner because there is more than one person working. I have ordered the Black and Bleu burger- it came out medium well instead of medium. I have also ordered the BLT with a side of brussel sprouts and both were very good. Friends of mine that I recently dined with talked very highly of the Lake Erie Perch.  I love that they now change their menu seasonally!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a strip mall. Great service from Amy. Atmosphere was great. Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar. Huge portions at a great price for brunch. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Great Happy Hour with $3 drafts, $6 glasses of wine,  $4 you call it liquor every day 2pm-6pm. Great Brunch every Saturday and Sunday 10am-2pm with live music. Even have Trivia Night and Paint Night. Absolutely love this place! Irish Midnight sandwich is a must."}
{"text":"So I decided to try red lantern out since I heard they revamped the place. Once a dive bar, now a polished modern establishment! Our waitress was named Tiffani and she was absolutely wonderful, always checking on us and super prompt! I ordered the Reuben tater tots and the buffalo chicken sandwich, yum to both of them! The prices are like everyone says pretty high and the menu could be a little bigger which is why I have this place four stars. I can't wait to see what they do in a year or so!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went in for brunch this morning (on a Sunday) the service was horrible.  Our server served us one round of drinks.  Came back to the table a half hour later to take our food order.  Our food took over an hour to come out, meanwhile our server never came to the table to offer refills or more drinks.  We expected to have a couple drinks and a nice brunch, but it was the opposite.  My friends and I all work in the service industry so we are always understanding in these situations but this was outrageous.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"Visiting in town for a hockey tournament and read reviews about the wonderful lobster Mac and Cheese. Decided to try this place. Only found out that lobster Mac and Cheese is not on the menu any longer. I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich. It wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome. I'd eat here again probably wouldn't have the Buffalo chicken sandwich.   The dishes used for presenting the food were interesting oval bowls with one side being higher than the other. Service was pleasant and reasonably attentive and prices were reasonable and the bathrooms were spotless."}
{"text":"Although the ambiance is great and customer service awesome, I have to give two stars. We went for brunch and the food was terrible. First the brunch menu is very limited, I asked if I could just have a simple omelette and our server said they don't do that, I was then going to order the chicken and waffle but first asked if they had sugar free syrup (I'm diabetic) she said no, then I asked for the simple \"breakfast\" option (2 eggs, toast and hash browns) I said I'll have wheat toast, she said they only have sourdough or rye, then I asked for egg whites or beaters she said they also don't do that. Anything I asked for she said they didn't have but I just brushed it off. Then the food came... I took one bite of the hash browns and my face instantly felt on fire. I don't think I've ever had a bite of something so shockingly overseasoned from a restaurant in my life. It tasted like they poured a whole can of pepper on my plate and that is no exaggeration. My fianc√© also had hash browns with his meal and felt the same way. I feel bad because again, it is a great atmosphere and very nice servers, maybe the lunch/dinner is better but not so good brunch."}
{"text":"Don't be taken back by the strip mall location,  this place has pleasantly sophisticated ambience,  deliciously balanced menu,  and terrific bar!"}
{"text":"Recently made my second trip to the Red Lantern. Both visits were for brunch and I'm excited to go back soon. This visit was for Saturday brunch. We had the place mostly to ourselves, which puzzled me because this place is great and deserves to be packed. I had the chicken and waffles, which is like my culinary holy grail. I try it practically everywhere I go. Red Lantern's version is towards the top of the list. It's a crispy fried breast filet atop the biggest Belgian waffle I've seen. They didn't try to get too fancy with he waffle - it's their standard Belgian - and I appreciate that because doctoring up the waffle for this dish doesn't always pan out. And I have to note that while I appreciate the fluff factor of the Belgian, I still want the crunchy outside, so this was prepared perfectly for me. You get a choice of regular or spicy maple. I went spicy, which just added a touch of heat and interest. Add hot sauce to really get your mouth buzzing. The dish is also served with mild red peppers/ chiles, which were a nice twist that really rounded it out.  I added bacon, because...well, bacon. KWIM? Nothing special there but it was good. On my first visit, I got the Boxty and took full advantage of the mimosa bar (there's also a Bloody Mary bar available), which I loved. Love the opportunity to play amateur mixologist. The Boxty was good but needed a lot more of that yummy corned beef. It will be a tough choice next time, but those are the kind of challenges I like. Our waitress both times was so sweet and definitely added to our enjoyment. Sunday brunch is accompanied by great live music. Hope you give the Red Lantern a try next time your in the West Park area. It's a gem!"}
{"text":"Good place, close to my house with good specials.  The Black Garlic Honey Mustard & House-Smoked Bacon Aioli with the rosemary fries is awesome. Overall it's very good, I'd like to see a few more sandwich options as the entrees get a little pricey."}
{"text":"So, I ate here with a group of friends of my Wife and I, and I didn't know what to expect.   The OLD Red Lantern had some divey charm and I'd only sampled the food before the place went under, but this place that took over the space and the name looked a bit too trendy and upscale for the likes of me. (I'm willing to admit that I'm about as upscale and trendy as a tiny fedora on a yak, so...yeah.)   Anyway, I found out the place is an offshoot of the Two-Bucks chain, or so I was told, and it's food, atmosphere and libations were pretty much what I'm come to expect from visiting those eateries. Not bad, just nothing I hadn't already seen at first, but I did notice that some of the foods, like the salads, were bigger and better than anything I'd seen at Two Bucks, which was a plus. The beverage selection was about the same as well, so no surprises.There was no problems with parking (big lot out front in the plaza,) and our seating wasn't a problem.   The only negative thing? They need more servers. There was one young lady taking care of about 8 tables, including our table of about 10 people, She was, needless to say, harried and running her crocs off.   The prices were moderate, and again, not a bad place, but it just seemed like another Two Bucks with a different name to me. I really hope they do something to give the place a little more of its own identity, as it seems that this is another chain restaurant in everything but name only. I'd go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. In my humble opinion, the new Red Lantern did not shine out as much as I'd hoped..."}
{"text":"We rarely get to Kamm's Corners but after hearing some good things about Red Lantern (including Yelp reviews of course) we decided to try it last Saturday. The dining room is a wide open space with high top tables spread out from each other and the one wall of booths and the other wall with the bar and several massive flat-screens. I couldn't  get a sense of the ambiance since we were there early -- 5:30 -- as the first stop of a busy night, and the place was less than half-filled at the time. As for the food, when you hear \"gastropub\" you expect a notch above a \"bar\" (Wait, wait! There's a joke about \"clearing the bar\" here somewhere. Nevermind, it's too late now) and at the Red Lantern the food is definitely better than the typical bar food. As an appetizer, we got the White Garlic Flatbread ($8.50) and I thought it was very decent, not up to Bar Cento standards, but very good. The crust was thin but still nice and chewy and while I thought there was a tad too much cheese, I think most others will think its perfect, especially late at night to go with beers. The garlic taste was spot on, not too overpowering. After the larger appetizer, we each settled on tacos for the main course. I got the Fish Fry Tacos ($10) and Jeannene had the Grilled Steak Tacos ($10.50). Each order came with three soft-shell tacos. The fish tacos were perfectly cooked and the fresh slaw on top added some crunch. At other restaurants, the tartar sauce would be overwhelming but here just enough was put on to accent the fish. While the fish tacos were light and citrusy, the steak ones were quite hearty. The thick strips of meat had the correct pinkness for medium and the avocado and sour cream paired well with it. I'm not a beer drinker so I can't comment on that but I will say they made a very proper old-fashioned. I gave it 3 stars but it really is more than \"A-OK\" and I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This morning my daughter and son-in law invited me to Waffles with Santa at the Red Lantern. Seemed like a fun idea and off we went -- with my 11 month grandson. Event started at 10 a.m. And we arrived at 10:30. The place was very well attended and felt festive. Soon after we were seated, a young couple with a toddler was seated next to us. We waited for a waitperson to come and take our drink order or bring us water. Noticed the couple next to us was being served their drinks before our waitress came with water and to take our order. We decided to take the baby to take his picture with Santa while we waited for our chicken with waffles and steak and eggs order. To make a long, irritating story shorter we waited an hour before our waitress came back to ask us what we had ordered so she could check its progress. Really?  In the meantime the couple next to us was served their meal. Waitress said it'd be a few minutes more and apologized for long wait. I asked her if our order had been started because I would rather cancel it and leave. She said it had and it'd be 10 minutes. Seemed earnest and sincere. By this time our toddler was tired and irritated, but the thought of leaving and starting the process anew in a different place seemed like not a good choice. Ok. 10 mins came and went and it was painfully clear that our order had not been placed when we arrived. Patrons who had clearly come in at least 30 minutes after we came in were being served. My daughter had enough and we left. We had consumed water and one glass of orange juice. I guess we skipped on that bill. No one approached us to apologize or anything. I appreciate that they were trying to promote their business and create a family event, but were ill prepared to respond to demand. There's no excuse for the careless way they treated us. This place is in our neighborhood and sadly, won't be patronizing it in future."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I visit a place and something feels just a little off, I hold my review until I have a chance to come back and try it again.  I first visited about a year ago for happy hour with two friends and we were the only people in the place.  The food and the drinks were delicious and at great prices.  However, the bar tender sat at the other end of the bar rolling silverware and completely ignored us.  We walked down to get her attention, twice.    Since the food was so good I didn't mind coming back when a friend wanted to have her birthday brunch here.  This time the place was still empty besides the 9 of us but the service was awesome and the build your own mimosa tray was fantastic.  The food was the issue for this visit. The waffles are the most dense and dry that I've ever had and the waffle grilled cheese sandwich is not a sandwich.     I gave it two tries. Sorry but I'm just not feeling it."}
{"text":"First time in the new Red Lantern. Great service, good food and great cocktails. Good happy hour specials. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great beer/wine/ cocktail selection. The atmosphere of this place is on point. Everything is clean, new and contemporary. We came here for a few drinks and appetizers before heading out to meet some friends down the street at west park station. I'm surprised this place wasn't packed! The bar is huge and can totally accommodate a big late night crowd. It has so much potential. Defiantly draws in an older crowd, lots of 80s music playing (which I love). I wish they were open later so we could come here to drink and dance! :)"}
{"text":"I would love to eat here again and soon! Stopped in because I was sick of hospital food and it was within walking distance. First, the bartender was incredibly nice and made me feel welcome. Second, the food was amazing. The Calamari could use a little seasoning but the portion was generous and the lemon aioli was out of this world. The burger was the best I've had in a long time but I was too full for the fries so I can't comment on those. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We're always looking for out-of-the-way places to try and Red Lantern Kitchen & Bar fit the bill.  It might not be out of the way for those on the west side but for us East Siders, crossing the bridge on a Saturday night is quite the commitment!  A friend heard about Red Lantern and I'm glad she did.  We weren't too impressed when we pulled into a strip center with a Marcs and a Dollar Tree but once we got inside Red Lantern we were happy.  The place is fairly no frills but it is comfortable with a nice crowd and we were greeted as soon as we sat down.  We ordered a round of drinks which were quickly brought back to the table.  I had the Cinnamon Apple Moscow Mule and it was very good.  We ordered the Reuben Tater Tots for the table and each ordered our entrees.  The appetizer took a very long time to get to the table but I'm happy we ordered it -- it was delish!  I'm glad we enjoyed the appetizer because we had another long wait before our entrees came out. I had the Irish Midnight, a corned beef and pulled pork sandwich with a tasty sauce on baguette.  It was very good and I took home half of it, as well as half of the crispy fries.  I'm not sure if we'll make the half hour drive to go back to the Red Lantern but, if you're in the area, be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We were promptly greeted and sat. The staff was friendly and prompt. Our food was actually quite tasty. The 2 stars comes from how they handled an error, which occurred as a result of the server keying in the wrong item.   We had ordered a Pear Salad with Tenderloin and were brought it with Chicken. While the server had the kitchen correct the error, it took so long that we had finished our food without the request protein. At that point, we were full and weren't going to eat the (very small) piece of meat. We politely asked if it could be taken off for reasons stated above. The response we were given by the server was that the item's cost was too high and the manager wouldn't allow her. (It was a $6 add on item). The server asked her manager and came back with the same response that they wouldn't remove it due to expense and told us that it took too long because of the doneness we requested (making it seem like our fault). We were asked for our email to give us a gift card for next visit. When we explained we were out of town and that wouldn't work, we were basically met with 'oh well, too bad for you' (not the exact words but that was the vibe) with no alternative given. We ended up paying the bill as it stood.   I've worked in the restaurant industry before and have never once told a customer no because the item cost was too high (because that's not the customer's problem) nor have I refused to remove an item due to my input error.   My complaint isn't about that I had to pay an extra $6, its about the principle of the situation and how it was handled."}
{"text":"While the service was great, the meal was very unsatisfying. I love all things pork, I know how to make it and I enjoy eating it. It is a very easy meat to work with. As a result, I ordered the pork shank. What I received was a very tough piece of meat with some kind of a sour tasting gravy. The meat took effort to cut into (not something I should be struggling with in a pork shank) and the gravy with its lack of any other flavor besides a sourness, made it seem like it had been left out a bit too long.  The server was wonderful and agreed to exchange it for something else, so asked for the lobster mac & cheese, a similarly priced item. That was also a disappointment, the cheese was too salty and heavy in flavor, completely overpowering the delicate taste of the lobster (also it was quite greasy). The lobster, in turn, was still cold.   I am normally not a picky eater, in fact I love trying new things and have a great deal of leaway on what I consider good, this did not pass."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Sometimes strip malls can be dicey, but the interior was surprisingly nice and modern. Service was quick and friendly. Had the French onion soup, wedge salad, Brussels sprouts with bacon and, most importantly, the pesto grilled cheese. So flavorful and perfectly cooked. Will definitely return to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The menu mixes it up well. The calamari is phenomenal. And the drinks are even better."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night around 10:30 hoping they were serving dinner. People were at tables, the bar area was packed, the booths were set up for service so we sat. And sat. And sat. We finally got up and left. When we were in the car, I decided to call & see if they were still serving food. No one answered. Love the food, but it was more of a noisy Kamms bar that night & not the restaurant I'm used to."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after seeing the review in Scene Magazine.  Realizing it was a West Park staple before I figured I would give it a try.    The same friend and I who I talk about in most of my reviews are wine lovers and Wednesday it is half off wine, so we said why not?  We got there and it is clean and new looking, I loved the feel.  Neither of us were dress to impress and after looking at pictures online we were worried we were going to look a little sloppy but it was definitely a casual feel once you arrive.    We opted to sit at the bar, but there were tables and booths as an option.  We each ordered water and wine, then asked the server for a suggestion on an appetizer.  He recommended the Spinach dip, my friend is lactose and tolerant so instead we opted to try the calamari disregarding what Scene had written.   It was actually good, obviously not what you would order in a seafood place but I was pleasantly surprised and the lemon aoli they give you to accompany it has a remarkable fresh flavor which really adds to it.   For entrees I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (a staple in my diet) and my friend ordered the portabello flat bread.  I was impressed with the timing of everything.  She knew were were there to chat and catch up so the appetizer came out, then she gave us some time before the meals came out which gave me confidence as well that what I was eating didn't pop out of a freezer.   My sandwich was delicious, juicy chicken with a fresh breading and wasn't greasy and a delicious buffalo sauce.  I asked for a side of ranch and it was a homemade peppercorn ranch which was delicious.  My friends flat bread was bigger than expected and wasn't one a thin extra crispy bread it had a little more dough to it which we both enjoyed.    I really enjoyed my meal and my wine.  There were definitely a few other things I wanted to try on the menu, so I will be back to give them all a try.  I would suggest stopping by soon, it was pretty dead in there and they deserve much more business with the re-opening.    Also, they have happy hour 7 DAYS A WEEK!  So I will be back on a weekend to check that out!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim, after being told about this by a coworker. That was a good tip. The menu is small but has nice variety.   We had the reuben tater tots- very tasty and very worth trying. We decided to share an entree, and selected the smoked meatloaf. There was plenty for both of us, and DAMN it was tasty.   If you're in the mood for beer, ask for recommendations. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the experience here. The food and drinks were great and the atmosphere was in point!"}
{"text":"Pretty kickass brunch.  I had the breakfast burger and my mom had the lobster Benedict.  Austin Walkin Cane was here singing workin man blues.  Pretty amazing Sunday and thank you to staff and Austin...cheers!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. Overall I'd probably rate 3.5 stars. The space itself is nicely decorated, clean and open. The service has been friendly and timely with taking orders and with drink refills (5/5 stars there!) Unfortunately the food has been somewhat inconsistent. I tried a salmon burger which was dry... would not order again. I had chicken and waffles off the brunch menu which was really tasty. This last time I tried the smoked salmon off the brunch menu. They doused a lemony sauce all over it which overpowered the salmon. I will continue to come back here and try other menu items because the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion."}
{"text":"My review is a little biased because I only dine here during Happy Hour. I got the black and blue burger with fries, and for $6 dollars I can't complain. It feels like a $10 dollar plate. It's really good and creative but simple burger. Amazing staff, the bartenders there out of the 3 times I came by were amazing. Thank you guys for doing a good job. My only complaint is there are some occasion they might over cook or under-cook a burger."}
{"text":"It has been years since i had been here.  The renovations are fantastic.  New menu friendly staff.   Went for brunch.  Shrimp and grits was great. Also tried the mouth watering eggs Benedict with lobster.    Plan on returning many many times"}
{"text":"I never went to the old Red Lantern but was excited for this new place under new management. Everything about it is good, but not yet great. I think they can certainly get there though. The interior is clean & modern. Service was friendly & quick although we didn't see our server nearly as much as I'd prefer. The menu is creative & not something you'll find anywhere else in Kamm's Corners. I love that they have a kids menu with all in-house made foods (no Kraft Mac & cheese here!)  We got the rosemary fries with dips to start. I didn't taste much rosemary but the fries were cooked to perfection & the sauces were so yummy! My husband got one of the strip steaks which was also cooked to order. He said it was good but was missing some flavor. I ordered the Hawaiian burger. It was cooked perfectly, however, under seasoned. It included a grilled pineapple slice and applewood bacon. I was most disappointed by the bacon. It was thinly sliced & was half a piece of bacon. Seriously, you can't even slap a full piece of bacon on the burger? My son loved his chicken fingers & chips. Pricing is on point for Cleveland & the food. I'll go back as I didn't have a bad experience & it just opened. Hoping that they will only improve from here. And I'm glad for something other than regular bar food in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always get nervous when I walk into a place and I'm literally the only guest in there. But despite being a completely empty restaurant, I really enjoyed everything.   Very modern, bright decor.   Decent drink selection. I'm intrigued to try the alcoholic milkshakes, although I opted for wine this time.  I started with the tenderloin Crustini. Huge portions of chilled sliced tenderloin served on crusitni crackers with a horseradish aioli. Beautiful presentation but could have used a little more flavor. I don't know what it was missing, but it was missing something to really make it stand out.  I then moved onto the pancetta gnocchi. Now this was phenomenal. So many wonderful flavors. It was everything my tastebuds hoped and dreamed it would be.   Salty pancetta, mixed with creamed corn and wilted spinach over top light and fluffy Ohio city pasta gnocchi (I left the mushrooms out). Again, a decent sized portion.   The bartender, Robin, was professional and polite. Seeing as how I was the only diner, she wasn't over the top in my face, but also gave me enough attention to make sure my experience ran smoothly.  I stopped in for lunch and will definitely be back to try other menu items. Also seems to have good happy hour reviews so would love to check that out, as well as the brunch"}
{"text":"been there a couple/three times now again, don't be fooled it is in a strip mall  don't be fooled when you walk in and there is almost no one there  the asian type nachos are awsome and enough for a meal itself  the selection is nice (entree's) the beer list is good as well  going back soon...  definitely give it a go, you'll be hooked"}
{"text":"Bae and I went here for brunch for the first time and it was excellent.   I loved the lighting, and cozy atmosphere. We did not have to wait, sat at the bar, and the service was great.   To drink we went with the mimosa kit, which came with a bottle of champagne, 3 juice options (we chose pineapple, strawberry spritzer, and orange juice) and fruit.   I ordered the chicken and waffles, they were excellent.   Overall very pleased and would say this is a go to place near rocky river."}
{"text":"What a difference a month makes....  I was here last in early December and it remained my favorite place in the Kamm's / River area, as it had been for a long time.   That all changed today. I came in for a beer and to order carryout. I was blind sided by the horrible decor remodel. It just a bit ago friendly, warm and inviting. Came in today to find a sterile coldly lit off putting shell.   It took a full 12 minutes for anyone to approach me, though I sat right at the bar. The beer I finally got was fine.  I ordered the braised pork belly, a grilled cheese with bacon, and the rosemary fries.  The pork belly was no longer pork belly. This was 2 tiny chunks of cheap pork roast. The \"bacon Brussels sprouts\" did not have any bacon in it, and the sprouts tasted like they were boiled in dish water. The fried shallots were obviously Durkee fried onions.   The bacon grilled cheese also had zero bacon, and for some reason they added a charred dry sinewy chicken breast.  The rosemary fries were still good.   This is so heartbreaking. I used too love this place so much. Was amazing, especially considering it's strip mall location, they'd managed a warm, friendly, inviting place you never wanted too leave. Now it's a soulless sad, quality vacuum, where I'll not return till I see an \"new management\" sign."}
{"text":"I've been there since the reopen and the food is great.  People behind the bar are always so personable and nice.  I love the drink selections and daily drink specials.  The Martinis are outstanding.  I am almost through the  martini list and I haven't had a bad one yet!"}
{"text":"Red Lantern Kitchen is not what you would expect.   From the outside it seems that the inside would look like a lot what it used to look like for years prior: A shabby little strip mall diner with cracking vinyl booths, old carpet, water-stained drop ceilings, sticky menus, fish fries and dated fare.   But these days, Red Lantern Kitchen is anything BUT what it used to be. The space has been updated to a modern gastropub vibe and so has the menu.   My guy and I stopped in here for dinner a few months back. We were looking for a restaurant/bar to hang at and grab dinner while we (our chairs) waited in line for Free Comic Book Day preview night at Carol & John's Comics--located a few store fronts down. I wasn't expected much, but was pleased right off the bat with the interior updates. There is no sign of the old diner it used to be.  We decided to sit at the bar, which is typical for us. We prefer bar service. We ordered two tequilas on the rocks and I was pleasantly surprised when the bartender offered us ice balls. Yep! No wimpy ice chips to water down my beverage. This was a treat! We then ordered some fries and two bacon cheeseburgers. The fries were tasty, but rather unmemorable. That's not a bad thing. The burgers came out in a bowl-like dish, which was strange. The patties themselves were thick, juicy and properly cooked. I wish they would have had American cheese, but I know that's not a knock on them according to the rest of the human population who isn't a Garbage Pail Kid, like me.   Overall, the items I had were tasty and made with quality ingredients. I just wish everything had a bit more umph to it, as far as the taste went. However, my opinion is limited to the two measly items I ordered from their vast menu. I also agree with some Yelpers who thought the prices were a little high. Regardless, I'll certainly be back to try more--especially since Carol & John's and their midnight release parties are a normal occurrence for us."}
{"text":"Some friends invited us to check this place out with them for brunch this past Sunday. They had been there before and really enjoyed it, especially the Bloody Mary/Mimosa self-serve bar.   It was nice that we didn't have to be up super early to get in and grab a seat. Live music starts at noon and we didn't have to wait for a table.   The bar idea is great. For $6, they pour your liquor and you get to put whatever condiments you'd like in/on your drink. There's a ton of items to choose from; everything is really fresh.   For brunch I ordered the smoked salmon lox. It was tasty but nothing out-of-this-world. I'm sure I could have created the dish with smoked salmon that I have in my fridge presently. The only advantage was that it was nice that I didn't have to do the legwork. The portion was just perfect for me - I actually took home leftovers. Others may have scoffed though - it's two thin slices of a bruschetta bread topped with rolled up salmon. A salad of greens and tomatoes is placed in the middle of the plate.  However, other portions were undesirable. Our friend had the Corned Beef Boxty before and really enjoyed it; a huge slab of corned beef came on the side - the way most breakfasts serve sides of bacon. So, he got it again and my boyfriend followed suit. Unfortunately, it seems that the establishment changed their recipe and presentation of this dish because the corned beef wasn't on the side anymore! It was practically non-existent. Very skimpy pieces were hidden in the potato pancakes. It's very deceiving when the menu description reads as follows:  Corned Beef Boxty | 10  Potato Onion Pancakes | Corned Beef | Roasted Red Pepper | Caramelized Onions | Two Over-Easy Eggs  This review goes to show you what a shame it is when word-of-mouth advertising gets out there. A clear lack of consistency definitely doesn't go unnoticed when new clientele check it out for the first time to find that the exciting dish on the menu has now been completely altered! My boyfriend was really discouraged. The meal definitely wasn't substantial enough to sell for $10. This was extremely disappointing and deserved to be mentioned, here, on Yelp.   I really struggle with giving this place three stars. However, to me, three stars mean that it's at least worth coming back and giving it another chance. Sadly, I don't think that's the case. I live on the east side and this place should have really wowed us to get us to drive back over to Lakewood again."}
{"text":"I am giving Red Lantern 4 stars but it is very close to 5.  The old Red Lantern was a dark neighborhood joint that locals would come to for perch and a beer on Fridays.  It has been totally transformed into a very cool bar with upscale pub food, prepared from scratch with a good selection of craft beers.  Enough TV's to watch a game but not intrusive to the dining experience.  My wife loves the perch tacos and I love the Hawaiian burger.  Happy hour specials are probably the best buy in C-town with a specialty burger and hand cut fries on Tuesday for...$5.50!  Also has Salmon Piccata and crawfish Mac and cheese so it is certainly not just a burger joint.  Wines on tap and Jackie O's beer from Athens. It's in a strip center by Kamm's Corners with plenty of parking.  Absolutely coolest new upscale bar in town.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Alright, I keep coming back to this place so I need to update my review. Again I will say that this place really tries, they keep adding new dishes to the menu and these are some alluring sounding creations - I think this is why I keep going back.   *Blueberry Waffle Grilled Goat Cheese $9 - Good but would have been great if they added some lemon/zest to the waffle batter and crisped up the waffle some more so it wasn't so soft.   *Corned Beef Boxty $10 (w/ side of thousand island)- The potato pancakes were delicious, the corned beef was like an ounce though so they definitely skimped on the meat.  *Bacon $2 - Regular bacon, I think you get 4 strips? *Broccolini $4 - Nice to have a veggie available so you don't feel as fat eating bread and potatoes.  *Lamb Meatballs $10.50 - Good, liked the dipping sauce it came with.  *Beet Salad $7.50 - Enjoyed this as well, minus the store bought croutons.  *Lobster and Crab Dip $11.50 - Smelled fishy in a bad way.  *Pancetta Brussel Sprouts $4.00 - Good.   So yeah rating is between 3 and 4 stars... the food is not bad by any means, and there are great ideas coming out of the kitchen, just not exactly executed the best way it could be. I keep hoping they kick things up a notch and meet their potential to serve some spectacular tasting food. Give 'em a try."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch unless you have a few hours to spend. We waited over 90 minutes for our food and the restaurant was at most 75% capacity. The manager was not apologetic and made it seem as if this was the norm. The food was just average. Several members of the party got chicken and waffles and it was no more than a tiny piece of chicken in the middle of a large waffle. Will never return."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend!!  First time trying since the remodel. The place was maybe half full on a Wednesday evening, service was awful, food was so-so. Truthfully, could've gotten a better burger & better service at 5 Guys! It took 45 minutes to get our food!! I could see if they were slammed but they weren't.... Too bad because I prefer to support local businesses... :("}
{"text":"I went here for one of my monthly dinners with a friend. She recommended it after going to happy hours here before. The restaurant is located in a shopping complex and you could easily miss it driving by. It does not stick out as a must-try restaurant.   Neither of us ordered drinks this time, but it looked like they had a great drink menu. We split the smokey eggplant dip as an appetizer. It did not look appetizing at all, but am happy to report it tasted a lot better than it looked. I have been wanting to try a salmon burger so I tried that and opted to get a asparagus instead of fries. My meal was very good. The only downside was the slow service, but it looked like there was only one waitress/ bartender working and she had quite a few tables so i understand how that happens."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little taken back when I saw the rating on this place. It doesn't reflect what I experienced at all. Great service, great beer and I hear they are teaming with Working Class Brewery next door in the near future. Being from Denver and Traveling a lot for work I get to experience some pretty great food scenes. I would put this right up there with most I've experienced. Great food selections and obviously fresh ingredients. Hats off to this place. Nice job"}
{"text":"The brunch is always very good and was a great choice for Easter. Busy, but not overcrowded, Comfortable table and excellent service. Omelette with wild mushrooms, caramelized onion, tomato and Monterrey jack was rich and delectable. Flavorful light as air hash browns.  Companion's Eggs Benedict was beautiful and the hollandaise was light with a citrus finish.  No rush to get up from table as at noon the crowd was already dispersing. An overall great Easter experience and so much more sensible than a traditional $65+ buffet."}
{"text":"The service is great but the food is horrible!!!  Our fish fry came out burnt. The cheeseburger we ordered medium. First it came out burnt. The second time it came out bloody. Don't recommend this cook"}
{"text":"A welcome establishment with a focus on food.  I remember this place in the old days.  One little window was the portal to this once old school establishment.  The place has kept the name but has been totally overhauled.  It is a trendy, hip gastropub type place that isn't annoying or pretentious.  It embraces it's neighborhood (WP Baby!) while offering great food.  Great beer selection as well!  I had the wings and burger as a litmus.  They both passed with flying colors.  The wings were some of the best cooked I have had anywhere.  Super crisp outside with a super tender and juicy inside.  Haven't had wings cooked to perfection like this anywhere.  The burger had a that lovely char that is so missed in burger cooking.  I can't wait to go back and try the other items that look so creative.  It's a W25th/Tremont type place with a true neighborhood feel.  This place is so welcome in West Park!  I love that mural too!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night during lent for the fish fry. My husband and I sat at the bar. We shared muscles, pierogies and the larger order of perch.  Bartenders were on point and friendly. The muscles were fresh and light with a sweet pomodoro sauce. Not a heavy butter/olive oil. The pierogie's are made in-house and stuffed with potatoes and cheese. The perch was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly.  With fair prices and not the crazy crowd at other establishments in the Kamms area, I highly recommend this place.  It has definitely changed from the old Red Lantern with early bird specials and outdated decor."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch  on a Friday afternoon. Rather empty when I walked in which made me wonder if it would be any good.   A lot of seating and bigger inside then I thought when I walked up.  Nice modern style.   We sat at a booth, I think our server might have also been the bartender.  She was nice, but slowwwwwww.  Was quick to take our drink order, but slow to take our order.   At 1 point when we had our food, someone in our group of 4 asked for more sauce... she forgot about it, and didn't even check in us for drinks or anything for at least another 20 minutes, so my friend waited since she wanted more tarter for her fish...which made her food get colder.    I ordered an Irish coffee.  At other places I could taste the liquor in it, not in this one.  I don't know if she hardly put any in or if it was watered down or so cheap or something.  It was not worthy.  I also forgot to tell her no whip cream since usually servers ask that while you order, so mine had a heaping amount .   I had the mascarpone chicken, and it was very good!   I felt the quality of food was definitely above average.  The chicken was very moist and seemed freshly breaded, I was impressed, and the sauce with it was perfect.   My friends seemed to like their dishes, except the chicken paprikash soup was very watery.     I would consider coming back to try other dishes.  If service was a little more attentive and I could taste the alcohol in my drinks, I'll add stars next time."}
{"text":"I love the red lantern.  great beer selection and awesome food.  I did like the old red lantern too, but the remodel had been good too.  it feels kind of like a \"bar rescue\" but has consistently had really good food.  the weekend brunch is fantastic!  We held a baby shower here too and they were very accommodating.  great atmosphere, great service, great food."}
{"text":"A bit fancy for a quick bite and certainly not the dive it was in the past.  I probably should I go back, but a little overpriced for the neighborhood.  Decent beer specials on draft night, but pretty underwhelming overall."}
{"text":"Red Lantern has been in Kamm's Corner for years and has had the reputation of being somewhat divey and a place for the locals to hang.  Never had the desire to go there when it was like this, but my curiosity was piqued when I heard that it was under new ownership. The new Red Lantern has been completely redone/remodeled with a gastropub type menu. Their menu was small, but I didn't have any problems picking a few things out.  I settled on the mussels and frites, because I am obsessed with dipping things, especially fries in what Jennifer W calls \"death juice\" (which is basically just the broth from the mussels mixed with wine)  The mussels seemed fresh (for Ohio), the broth went perfectly with the fries and I loved the bits of sausage. Presentation was simple and tasteful. My friend ordered some chicken wings with the Jameson BBQ sauce and he couldn't stop raving about it.  Of course, being a dipper from waaaay back....I HAD to order a side of this Jameson BBQ sauce so that I could dip my fries in it. My friend was right...it was magical!  Can't really describe something that is magical....you'll have to try it yourself. Overrall, I had a pleasant experience and I see myself coming back in the near future....Heard they had a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Their burgers were one of the best in the land at one point.  Now there are thee selections and very meh choices.  They had a burger night special and everything.  Menu changes in the wrong direction too often.  I like about 50% of the menu these days, and I'm pretty easy to please. I will say the filet was one of the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Great brunch and awesome Bloody Mary bar. But beware look at your bill. Make sure you know how much your drink is because they will add an extra $1 to your drink. It's happen to me numerous times at the red lantern. When I point it out to them they always blame the machine for the mistake.  At brunch today we did the Bloody Mary, they gave us Tito's vodka without asking us if we wanted Tito's and then charged us $2 for it on our bill without saying a word to us. All ways pay attention too your bill!!"}
{"text":"They are trying hard and very nice but the food simply was not that good. We tried the scallop appetizer, very odd vanilla flavor and small portion, and then the shrimp tacos again only 2 small shrimp per taco and lacking flavor. I would have liked to give a better review and would try again if I see reviews where the food has improved but until then staying away."}
{"text":"Ambitious menu poorly executed. My mussels came with 3 dead (unopened) ones. The shrimp on my skewers were overcooked to the point of being shrimp jerky. They offered  a $10 gift card - really?"}
{"text":"I went to Red Lantern twice over the past week. I went to Star Wars trivia there and it was a good time. They have plenty if seating, which includes booths, high tables, tables and seats at the bar. The had a special Star Wars menu for the trivia night. The food was good and reasonably priced. I plan on going back for more trivia nights. I had my bachelor party weekend this past weekend and some of my guys and I went to the waffle bar this Saturday. The waffles are really good and they have plenty of toppings to choose from. They also have a Bloody Mary bar as well where you can make you own Bloody Mary. They have a huge brunch selection as well."}
{"text":"First time visit but not our last. Had Pot stickers? to start very tasty. Onion soup next really good. Flat bread Brisket next, also good. A little to much cheese. But yet very tasty. Service was top notch. Very nice clean place."}
{"text":"The last time I entered this place was 2010.  It was outdated and the food was crap.  I stopped in last night to check it out. Since I haven't been here in so long I figured why not. I was shocked at the transformation. All new decor. A brand new bar. All the outdated tables gone. The menu completely updated. Amanda was behind the bar. Very friendly I asked questions about it when was it last updated. She was very attentive and help me realize that I've been missing out. I will definitely be back.  I did not eat anything.  So. I will do a review when I eat here."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple times since my original review...this place has a great brunch. Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar and live music. Love it. The guy they had playing guitar today was really good and while we waited a long time for our food, the music and drinks kept us entertained. My husband got the steak and eggs but my mom and I went for sandwiches. She had a BLT and I had a grilled cheese. My sandwich was delicious- lots of arugala and tomato kept it fresh and not overly heavy...and it was served w perfect french fries :-*"}
{"text":"Going back home to visit my family and friends after 2 1/2 years we decided to meet for brunch on Sunday the day before Memorial Day at the Lantern! When I walked In I was mesmerized by the remodel. The place looked amazing!  I was greeted by one of the girls who remembered me when I used to frequent the Lantern before I moved to Savannah!  She asked me how I liked the place and all I could say was incredible, amazing! Wait a Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar? Oh yes! I absolutely enjoyed the Mimosa bar and all the trimmings and choice of juices! I could not decide what to order everything looked so good! Well how about a drunken shake? Sold!!!! Lets just say I had 3!!!! Time to order some food!!! I ordered the Rueben tater tots! To die for!!! I also ordered an awesome blue hamburger made perfectly! It was a perfect Sunday brunch. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I hate when I fall in love with a place then have to accept the reality of what's served. I understand everyone has different tastes and it's hard to please everyone, but why overcomplicate food? I ordered the pork chop plate. I asked for the peach ragu to go on the side, but alas the chop was smothered in it. I scraped it off as best I could, but I guess they were insisting on ruining the taste of a perfectly good chop with their self created concoction. The green beans didn't far any better. Advertised as green beans and bacon they had a sauce on them (my guess was a bad garlic concoction) that was neither green bean based or bacon based that overpowered the beans. I guess I have to start learning to eat \"creative\" food. In my view, this place would be a lot better if they kept the food basic then built off it to the customers taste. At least the place is clean.  Update. I've been coming in here pretty regularly since my initial review. It's a short walk. The place is clean and the barmaids/waitresses are attentive. Nevertheless, I'm still frustrated that the French Underground is holding the kitchen hostage. I'm sure Lebeau from Hogan's Heroes is back there telling the cooks to \"sauce everything up\". Too bad. The food would actually be good and draw more folks from the working class neighborhood that is West Park if they weren't trying to be a Parisian bistro. I've tried to mess with the kitchen staff by ordering everything plain, but they can't help themselves. Thankfully, the PH is a short walk away."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of 8 of us. On a Saturday morning, and we were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was very friendly. They also had an exciting mimosa package with the bottle of champagne and several different flavors of juice and fruit. Although I ordered a different drink, that option was by far the best part of the brunch. They were also able to split it amongst 6 of the girls, which I absolutely appreciate since it seems harder and harder for places to split checks for some reason. My drink was also tasty, I ordered a hot toddy, which was made very well since they had a decent tea selection. The atmosphere of the bar does have a sexy vibe to it, and my girlfriend says their lunch is very good and typically busier. I was not at all impressed with my food. The description was totally more impressive than it actually turned out. A blueberry waffle grilled cheese with goat cheese and arugula, Woah, that sounds delicious. Unfortunately, it came out stacked with four pieces on a skewer, it was also cold, which I wasn't certain was intentional or due to sitting around, either way, I couldn't enjoy the dish totally not knowing this and because I was expecting a grilled cheese not what it was. The flavors were absolutely there and had potential if they modify it a bit and turn it into an actual grilled cheese sandwich between two waffles. Everyone was else was just okay with their meals, no one really made mention of anything really standing out. They are also owned by Two Bucks who are more known for their inexpensive drinks rather than their menu which also is less than impressive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, odd crowd, cold inside, lack of knowing if it is a seat yourself or wait to be seated when you come in.  Not knowing what to expect as far as menu selection, I was excited to try this place.  Ok selection, not the normal things I expected(my assumption lead me wrong).  Prices were a tad high for something on the menu.  Had the white garlic flat bread, it was ok, too much cheese and there were leafy like things on it. Apparently to give it a nice presentation. Just the right amount of garlic. I would get it again (if I go back) as an appetizer, not a meal. Fries were good, but fries are fries.  My partner had fish and chips, he loved it. But I felt it was a bit overpriced.  Service, ya'll need help! Hire more people! It was a it slow, but our server was great nonetheless.  Not really sure if I'd be dying to go back, if I go, it will be an impulse decision."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday and only 1 person works the bar and restaurant on Sundays (I asked). She did the best she could but the service was slow and I didn't get any refills. I felt really bad asking her for anything because she was running like crazy. The server also couldn't answer any questions about the steaks on the menu even though she ran to the kitchen to ask the cook. We ordered sandwiches which were just ok. He got a burger and I got the portobello sandwich. Not much taste and mine was lukewarm. We ordered dessert as well. The lava cake ala mode. It was delicious but soooo tiny! The ice cream was literally 2 bites. I was sad. I definitely won't go back with all the other wonderful choices in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat in Westpark! We moved here only 2 months ago and have already eaten here 4 times! The food and menu are absolutely awesome! The chef is amazing! I would highly recommend their lobster mac and cheese, the reuben tater tots, their mussels and their scallops!! My husband loves their shrimp tacos! They have a GREAT bar selection as well! All the servers are extremely nice and the service is great! It is for sure our favorite place!"}
{"text":"Came in here for my birthday with my girlfriend. Right away I really liked the atmosphere, very open and spacious, the decor is very modern. The beer list caught my eye because not only does it have a great selection, the prices are great! Average $5 for a bottle of craft beer, I got Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster on tap which was only $6 and was served at perfect temperature. YOU MUST GET THE REUBEN TATER TOTS. Great appetizer, tasted amazing. Got the crawfish po boy for an entree and it exceeded my expectations. Will definitely be going here again and again. The prices are great and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"This place has a special place in my heart. When I was a little girl I came here with my dad a lot on Sundays. Although, it is now owned by different people, they kept the name and the original sign is still there.  However, it is completely different from food to ambiance. I give the place a 4 stars for their Sunday bruches and mimosa/ bloody mary bar but 3 for their everyday menu. I have eaten here a few times and really only love them on Sundays. I like sitting at the bar and the tvs are great to watch sports. If I lived closer I may frequent the establishment for happy hour but in the end it is just a fancier Two Bucks          ( same owners)."}
{"text":"Was driving to work and needed lunch on the go so I stopped in for a quick bite. Don't give me wrong the place looks great. Awesome bar, huge tv's, I was telling myself \"man I gotta hit this place up with the buds, it seems like the spot\"  However, I ordered their \"lantern burger\" and being a burger freak I was highly disappointed. First, I ordered it medium well and it came well done. And it just didn't taste good. The quality of the beef was just awful it seemed like. Fries weren't that great either. Only thing they had going was their jameson BBQ sauce. I most likely will hit up their happy hour just to taste other foods they got, but so far not a fan of this place. Also based on looking at the menu a lot seems overpriced. Night Life seems like it has potential but doubt anyone goes there since it's in a plaza."}
{"text":"Went last night have been going there for a couple of years. The menu has changed and a couple of favorites are disappointingly gone.  The wedge salad with the black garlic dressing is no longer on the menu. The waitress over compensated for the excruciatingly long wait for food.  I was also placing a to go order to take home we told the server not to wait to put in the order.  We ate, paid for our food and still waited another 20 minutes for the to go order.  Took home chicken parm.  My husband was pleased with the chicken but extremely disappointed with the over cooked pasta.  I had gotten a BLT the bacon was over cooked.  This use to be one of my favorite places.  Hoping it was a bad night."}
{"text":"This is a great modern hipster little restaurant. Came here with friends for brunch. Food, drinks and service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Breath of fresh air in Westpark.. Nice, modern decor with open feeling. Menu and handmade cocktails is diverse, a little eclectic and fun; nothing like you will find at the other restaurants nearby. The food we ordered (calamari, steak & pierogies) wasn't to die for, but was pretty good. The pierogies were the best part! I actually think the menu might be a little overpriced, but I'm willing to pay for the atmosphere. Will definitely go back again-lots of things Id like to try!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and stopped in one day expecting a little plaza bar with typical bar food. Boy was I wrong! And I'm usually not happy to be wrong!  The menu was really great. Lots of variety and dishes that were not typical. The atmosphere was very friendly and our server was lovely!  I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad which was a very generous portion. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back again! My friend also ordered a salad and was very happy with it. Delicious food at a good price, with attentive servers. What more would you look for?  UPDATE: I recently returned for the Bloody Mary bar and a grilled cheese sandwich. Once again I was not disappointed. Excellent Mary bar with lots of toppings and juice selection. My grilled cheese featured frizzled onions, arugula and cherry tomatoes. I am drooling just thinking of it. I skipped the fries and thoroughly enjoyed my grilled zucchini. YUM"}
{"text":"A nice modern, clean place. Went there on a thursday night. $2 mexican beers and half price taco plate.  3 grilled steak tacos with sour cream and mixed greens.   Soft grilled taco with real grilled taste.  Not just grilled markings on the taco shell. Nice presentation.  Good quality slice of steak.  Some nice taps but, would be nice if they had a cheap low end tap like Labatt's or Budweiser - for the pocket book.  Great TV watching for sports. Good placement.  Service was pretty decent. She noticed every time someone was low on beer.  One bad thing - the music is horrible.  We could not even make out the songs - weird stuff. And the sound is not good.  They need better speakers and something to absorb the sound - so it doesn't sound like an auditorium PA system.  Really guys, if your reading, this fix the music!!"}
{"text":"I end up here way too often for how just okay it is. Granted, I've only been to brunch -- but I've been to a lot of brunch here.   Any entree I've ordered has been very underseasoned and giving off a just-recently-thawed vibe. Don't make the mistake of ordering steak and eggs! The food has been disappointingly inconsistent, so even if it was your favorite dish last week, you may return to find an entirely different recipe.   The only redeeming factors are the jazz on Sunday -- who doesn't want a little jazz to cure their hangover?! And the build your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. Bloody Mary bars are super popular right now, but I really love the mimosa bar -- several different juices and fruits!"}
{"text":"Let start off with telling you that my mother is a very picky eater and even she liked this place. They are decorated in a classy yet relaxed way which is kinda unexpected if you look at the rest of the stores and restaurants in the area. Our waitress was friendly and answered all the questions we had about the food. My mom ordered the perch sandwich and I ordered the mushrooms Swiss burger. I was kind of jealous of hers because it looked amazing. Not to discredit mine however because it was very good too. It's hard to find a place that actually cooks your burger the way you want it but this place nailed it.  I'm excited to try all the other things on the menu as they had a very wide variety."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in on a quiet Monday night. We ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was great, when we finally got it. We ordered some blue cheese olives with our martinis. Apparently, these require a PhD to make. We waited an additional 30 minutes for these, because of the lack of staffing. OK. Sure. It takes 30 minutes to jam blue cheese into olives, that are already on your menu. I might believe that on a Friday, but not on a dead Monday night. You can do better. I suggest someplace that is more concerned with customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I only gave it 4 stars because the fillet I ordered was kind of small."}
{"text":"Good for a snack or happy hour specials. Always friendly and service is good. The menu had few items i would come back for though."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, the servers have always been good, friendly, and knowledgeable. The food has been fantastic on every vist, although a bit over priced for some dishes.  They have a great Sunday brunch with a mimosa bar. Try the calamari and the rosemary fries."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it did not disappoint!!! Immediately upon walking my group was greeted and told we were welcome to sit wherever we would like. :)  They had an amazing build your own Bloody Mary OR mimosa bar with fresh fruits for mimosas and a selection of topping for our bloody Mary's from bleu cheese stuffed olives to a variety of cheeses, meats, and veggies. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a spicy maple syrup it was delicious!!! The menu is well thought and affordable. Our group actually considered hanging out until the dinner menu rolled out because everything sounded so good! On top of that they have an amazing cocktail selection! We definitely found our new spot!   Amazing service! Delicious food! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":".     !!  LAKE ERIE PERCH is back at the Lantern  !!                        Yay!  And it's offered DAILY !  Plus...                      As of Lent 2014                     Friday ONLY Special during Lent            All-you-can-eat Lake Erie Perch 4-6pm, $20         (with their own kettle chips, coleslaw, and tartar)  We're so glad that the Red Lantern is back in business.  Same location at Kamm's Plaza, but with new owners, new decor, and new trendier menu.   Previous owner's menu offered more familiar homey-type offerings---this one features a variety of dishes going in the direction newer spots head, such as \"specialty\" beef burgers, salmon and meatless portobello styles, too, Crawfish & Sausage Po'Boys, Crab Cakes, Steamed Mussels, Fried Calamari, Crawfish Mac & Cheese, Fish Tacos, and even PORK BELLY tacos.  You'll still find Black Angus Strip Steaks, BLT's, and Grilled Cheese---but with newer approaches in preparation, saucing, and accompanying ingredients.    See more at:   redlantern.us  The only dish we've tried so far: ~ LAKE PERCH N' CHIPS       lightly-breaded Lake Erie (woman on the phone       called it \"fried\", but when tasted, it might be baked       ---that's okay---maybe healthier), with their Irish        Crisps (Kettle-style chips), tartar (wa-a-ay better        than most others), fresh slaw (vinegar & honey)         ...EVERYTHING was very good !         Not 5 stars only because I prefer an even lighter,        unseasoned breading.  (Just a little salt on the       raw fillets.)  These WERE lightly breaded with a        mild touch of possibly parsley.         Still very good, and highly recommended.    Before our visit---and really looking forward to trying the NEW Lantern's yellow perch preparation---I HAD to think ahead.   Couldn't help myself.  The OLD Lantern's were 5 star, and maybe impossible fish hooks to fill.  I take Lake Erie's perch very seriously---it's THAT wonderful.  (Actually saw it on a restaurant menu in London---England!...not Ontario---several years ago, for like a hundred pounds.  Slight exaggeration, but not cheap. $$$ !)   What if I didn't like the new untried preparation from the new owner?\"  (Like recent disappointments from Bonnie's (1 star) and Stamper's (3 star) in Fairview Park.)   I could only hope.  Don't mind frying them myself---but would love to find a spot who'll do it with better results than others.    Then---the NEXT hurdle was their TARTAR SAUCE.   The only time I like a touch is with breaded or battered  fish.  And for me, a sweet---or worse---horseradishy ??? (yech!) tartar is---for others---like a wine with a pucker-inducing note of white vinegar.  That would ruin it for me.  Easily solved---I'd sneak in my own homemade.   Happily, never touched mine---theirs was just fine.             Matt was our smiling, friendly, eager-to-please server.  Hope this NEW Lantern with it's stark gray-toned industrial-modern interior---but welcoming and comfortable---does really well.  Will DEFINITELY be back for more PERCH---and then we'll try that PORK BELLY, too---for sure.   ~ Something they should seriously consider, however:  shades, blinds, panels, or other day-time-hours covering, to cut down on glare coming through their east-facing windows.  Oddly enough, but even at 4:30pm, too bright for someone facing that direction.  Until they do, remember to bring your sunglasses...may be wise to apply a little sun-screen, too (hehe)---just to be safe. ."}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place.  Live so close and had never come here before. The interior is open and I like the decor. There are plenty of TVs. They have good beer AND drinks AND good food. That's a triple win! We had the spinach artichoke dip for an app, and the portion size was HUGE! Very good, not too much spinach actually in there, more like a cheese artichoke dip, but good nonetheless. Also had a salad and the french onion soup for dinner. All the portions are very generous... and I ate every bite. And left feeling stuffed.  I'm so excited to have found this place, nice neighborhood hangout! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When walking into the Red Lantern, you are immediately aware this isn't the Red Lantern of years gone by. It is visually pleasing and looks so much cleaner and hip.   The menu is varied and lots of tempting selections. I had met my daughter for a glass of wine so we sat at the bar and planned on having appetizers only.   She ordered the chicken paprikash soup for a starter and then we thought we would go from there.  Well, what a huge disappointment. It tasted like salty water. There was no real paprika taste nor was there any flavor in the chicken. The spaetzle were not homemade and were mushy and overdone. After this, we decided to be satisfied with our wine and not tempt fate with more appetizers. This may be a bit unfair, but the soup was that bad. Also, you are charged for the crostini served with it, but at least that was done right.   Our bill for happy hour for the soup, crostini and carafe of wine was over $40 which I thought was a bit steep for happy hour pricing.   No, I will not return as there are plenty of great happy hour places with good food where I can spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times.  Let's start with the pluses. While the folksy old Red Lantern of years ago had its charm and decent comfort food, it was quite low on ambience. The new owners have turned the space into something modern and inviting. The staff was hustling, whether it was for the two times we dined in or the one we carried out.  So what's the problem? It's the food.  The first and third times the food was just awful.  The middle time, it was okay, so we thought we'd give it another try. Dry fish. Over-cooked chicken parm that was completely inedible. A \"medium\" cheeseburger that was making a crunching sound.  The long and short of is, we're rooting for this place, and hoping they succeed.  It just hasn't worked out for us."}
