{"text":"Great server. Very small liquor quantity in drinks. Food excellent, however we were told they were out of peanut sauce for the Pad Thai. Problem was they told us after the dishes where delivered!  Again, the server was awesome."}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of Chinese buffet (a prestigious title to be sure) and I have the say I was pretty impressed with this one. Food was fresh not soggy as is the case in many buffets. The variety of the foods offered was really pretty good. Normally I find one or two entrees that I am interested in, but this place easily had four or five. The hot and sour soup (which is one of my gauges for how much I like a Chinese place, buffet or otherwise) was very good. My server was also very attentive. I would definitely recommend this place as a good place to grab some grub on the quick."}
{"text":"Clean, good variety in buffet: from sushi to Chinese and more. Excellent price too. $11.50 for lunch buffet every day! Good family restaurant."}
{"text":"Buffet chinois classique, mais avec beaucoup de choix de qualité à un très bon prix. Parfait pour un dîner ou un souper rapide avant de sortir en ville."}
{"text":"Good service and nice room, but disgusting food.  I tried pretty much a little bit of everything they had except the soups.  At first I tried all the classic Chinese dishes. Those that were supposed to be sweet were just too sweet and a lot of them had a weird taste which for some reason reminded me of the smell of Toronto's Chinatown streets (don't ask why...) The fried ones tasted funny (I guess because of the oil they use)  Then I though I should try the sushi. They were freshly made, but still gross and chewy.  Then I decided I was done with Asian food and went to try their onion rings and fried chicken. They were both very unimpressive and had this funny taste too (again, maybe the oil?).  Then I went for the salad that you could compose yourself and it was meh.  Finally I had the \"mille feuilles\", which was obviously nothing like the real thing but also surprisingly less disgusting than the rest.   Admittedly 11.5 is not expensive for a diner, but at the same price you can find many options that will not upset your stomach. I'm still trying to digest their food.  Too bad because the location and space has some potential. It still was a quite relaxing place."}
{"text":"Personne ne parlait le français :( pour une ville francophone, c'est raté!!  Pas de sushi alors que c'est un buffet chinois.  Personnel non sympathique et en plus, nourriture très moyenne pour le prix!  Même pas la présence de soupe miso!!!  Bref Surtout NE PAS Y ALLER...."}
{"text":"Food not so good. Not authentic Chinese food. Probably the only good is the spare ribs. Price is not bad. You get what you paid for. Will not recommended"}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant, I have different expectations depending on each place. For this spot, I expected a cheap price, good food and my tummy being filled at the end. And this place managed to achieved all above standards.  If you go there at noon, you can expect to eat a pretty nice variety of chinese food. They got chatsu, general tao, fried shrimps, even sushi and many more. Obviously, the food is not top notch then again I didn't go there for a royal diner. I went there a few times now and every time I was happy with the food, price and my tummy is definitly happy."}
{"text":"My expectations were low but this place managed not to reach them. It was low because it's a buffet so I was not expecting authentic food. It did not reach it because I was sick after going there not once but twice. Some could say that I did not learn my lesson but we were going there for a work lunch and I did not pick the place. I don't advise going there."}
{"text":"Sounded like a great idea. The pictures of the buffet items on the board outside looked pretty good. So, we went in.  The restaurant was dimly lit, but was much larger inside than it seemed from outside. The buffet area, however, was very small.  There was one two sided counter and one one-sided counter.  There was also a sushi making station. The one sided section contained some dinner items, salad items, fruit and dessert. The two sided section contained about 14 items plus 3 soups. The hot and sour soup actually didn't taste bad, but it was unlike any hot and sour I've had before. It contained the base, Chinese tree fungi and tofu - and that's it. It didn't get much better. Genl Tso's chicken was made as I've never had it before. The chicken fried rice was dry and tasteless - not to mention about 98% rice. The dumplings in peanut sauce seemed to be just that - Flour dumplings with some peanut sauce. Beef bourguignon contained tough beef in an insipid sauce . . . and so on and so forth. In all fairness the sushi wasn't too bad and the service was okay. All in all, at $16.50 per person - not including tea - it was pricey for an Oriental buffet with so few offerings and with such inferior food. And, by the way, none of the items pictured on the board outside were on the buffet."}
{"text":"Hands down, that was the worst Chinese food ever. We couldn't even finish two bites of anything. The food tastes like they just slapped everything between their butt cheeks for flavor. Weird taste, dirty place. If you decide to eat there , make sure your health insurance is up to date."}
{"text":"It's not so obvious to find a place for a proper meal in less than an hour downtown montreal before a concert at night! We did some walking on the weekend to identify which places could fit the bill and double-checked on Yelp to confirm and eliminate some options. This place did came as our selected choice being less than two blocks from the Bell Centre (where The Who were playing) and being a buffet, we can time our service ourselves. There were 4 of us and we arrived gradually over a 20 minutes period but the buffet concept did enable us all to eat at our pace.  With a good selection of soup, appetizers (including some sushi), entrees and desert, it was exactly what we wanted. All in all a good choice for those kind of situations!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Overcooked reheated buffet items in sticky congealed sauces, pedestrian offerings, flat and exploitative of the lunchtime crowd.   The attempt at a sushi bar was miserable. The kitchen should tick to stir fry.  Go elsewhere, avoid this dive at all costs. Not even worth an attempt to make this review funny."}
{"text":"Was really not what we were expecting.. in a good way!  The best managed Chinese buffet I have ever been to. I really applaud the owner of this place, please keep it up!  The Good: -Great selection of soups, main plates, sushi, AND dessert (definitely changed from one of the past reviews of this place) -Fresh sushi is consistently being prepared in front of your eyes -Had unique options like a red bean soufflé and coffee mousse for dessert -The restaurant is very clean- the carpet is updated, the walls are neatly painted- the atmosphere is still quaint but definitely does not look like the typical rundown Chinese buffet restaurant setting  -Staff is VERY attentive, every empty plate was picked up by the server respectfully within 5 minutes of being finished -Family friendly, it was very easy to see that a lot of regulars go here and that this place has built up quite a loyal costumer base -The staff is knowledgable about their food options, my mother asked about a certain seafood dish and her question was answered very thoroughly by the staff member  The Bad: -Weird hot and sour soup, it doesn't taste like other hot and sour soups my party has had in many places  -The salmon fish used for sushi here is smoked instead of raw, which is understandable due to the price of the meal  Overall, this place is a great for a quaint, quiet family meal- we will be back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! The food was pretty decent the sushi was ok. Obviously the quality will not be amazing at a buffet but it fulfills the purpose of being full for cheap! Good service too!"}
{"text":"Over priced for no reason. Basically like every other Chinese buffet . Would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Chinese buffet a few times and thought that for a Chinese buffet place, it was pretty good. I've been to 2 other Chinese buffet places in Montreal and I would say that this one is in the middle (i.e. it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either). The type of food served here would be akin to what you can get at the Tiki Ming places in food courts. At lunch, for a few dollars more ($12.95+tax+tip) than what you would pay at Tiki Ming, you would get an all you can eat buffet of the same type of food. Soft drinks aren't included in the buffet price.  I generally will start off with their hot & sour soup. Although it isn't the best hot & sour soup that I've had, it is decent for a buffet. I generally get some onion rings, some Singapore noodles, some General Tao chicken, some pineapple chicken, egg rolls, some dumplings, and fried chicken. They do have some sushi/California rolls here but I don't go for it.  To end off my meal, I will generally have some fruit and some ice cream."}
{"text":"I was here last week because I had a craving for Chinese food and I was passing by...never again, or only in case of dire need. All of the chicken dishes had a suspicious soapy taste (due to decomposing proteins, according to culinary website), the ribs were over-cooked, the spring rolls were OK and the fried rice too, but there were very few meat or poultry dishes that were edible. The customer service was good and the servers were cordial and polite, but the quality of the food was rather crappy"}
{"text":"On allait au concert rock du groupe THE WHO au centre Bell et nous cherchions un resto pas trop cher, rapide et qui plaît à tous (nous étions quatre à table). Ka lo hin répondait exactement à nos besoins.   C'est un buffet chinois, avec quelques plats thai et du sushi. Rien d'extraordinaire, mais il y a de tout: des soupes, des salades, des plats chauds avec viandes, des légumes sautés, des fruits et des desserts (tartes, gâteaux, crème glacée, biscuits au amande). J'ai goûté à un peu de tout et c'était bon. Comme nous étions mardi soir, il y avait peu de clients et c'était tranquille. Notre serveur était gentil et professionnel.  Un bon endroit pour manger quand on va au centre Bell ou que l'on fait des courses au centre-ville..."}
{"text":"Standard Issue Chinese Buffet. But it's perfect for when you are jonesing for your Standard Issue Chinese Buffet. They also have Sushi (looks very utilitarian) It's all very tasty but has no finesse what so ever. But then, at lunch time we mostly look for some good stomach stuffing chow and this fits the bill. The Gen. Tao is pretty crunchy and the tiny spring rolls I could eat till I puke. There's nothing more to say. Quick feeding station, decent food. Place is PACKED at lunch hour on weekdays."}
{"text":"Super bon rapport qualité prix ,assortiment de maki toujours frais un de mes coup de coeur est leur poulet , peau super croustillante . Super endroit pour le weekend lorsque t'as pas dejeuner"}
{"text":"Enfin un buffet asiatique qui reflète ce qu'on attend d'un buffet asiatique. J'y suis régulièrement seul ou entre amis selon le temps et les horaires. On y mange à sa faim, on y trouve tout ce dont on a envie, soirs et midis. Tout est bon. L'endroit est petit mais le buffet est très grand. On doit y retourner pour tout essayer !  Finally an asian buffet that corresponds to what you need to find in an asian buffet. I'm there regularly alone or with friends depending on time schedules. You eat 'til you're full, everything your heart desires, evening and lunch. Everything is good. The place is small but the buffet is wide. You need to return a second time to try everything !"}
{"text":"Convenient location, reasonable variety of food choice, affordable price, good for lunch, dinner not recommend"}
