{"text":"I stopped in Lviv on a whim this evening and ordered some takeout.  I'm glad I did.  I ordered a #1 (haluski, stuffed cabbage, and pierogies), a #6 (haluski, pierogie, and kielbasa), a side of sauerkraut, and a meat chebureki.  Everything was delicious and full of flavor. Best haluski and stuffed cabbage I've had. Don't tell my family. Huge portions. My gf and i ate as much as we could and we have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.   We will be going back, and I will be telling whoever will listen about it (including strangers on yelp) I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Just take out from here and we couldn't be happier! We tasted a few things, hoagies, dinners (pierogi, stuffed cabbage and haluski), and chebureki (fried meat pie). Everything was delicious! we will be going back and taking friends and family there!"}
{"text":"The weather was not nice out, so it did take some time in getting delivered. The food was not great but not horrible. I would give it another shot, but I think I will pick it up this time."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food and service definitely need to be improved. They gave me the wrong flavor of pierogies. The stuffed cabbage was filled with rice and fat and very little meat. The borsch must have been made a week earlier because it tasted bland. I will not return."}
{"text":"Great for authentic Eastern European food. You can tell that pierogies and pelmeni are homemade! I can't wait to try some of their large selection of sandwiches and hoagies."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard Scott Zolak on Boston sports radio talk about Haluski back in Western PA, I've had a jones to get some. Finally I got the call from work to pitch in in the Pittsburgh area. I googled Haluski near the airport and found Lviv. So me and Big Al roll in yesterday around 230pm. Coraopolis is certainly the land that time forgot with a lonely main street and too many empty storefronts. My antenna were buzzing as I knew some serious home cooking was in store. We walk into Lviv and it's plum empty, except for the two Nonnies sitting in the corner of the dining room. Wearing babushkies and coats (hey, it was 70 degrees outside). Big Al is giving me the stinkeye, but I'm all in. I hit the trifecta with the #1 combo: Haluski, pierogi and stuffed cabbage. The plate was loaded for only $7.99. Now I'm a grazer, but I made quick work of all this wonderful home cooking. The cheese and potato pierogi were little pillows of goodness. The haluski had a faint red pepper kick and was worth the wait. And the stuffed cabbage was both enormous and delicious. It took me back to those bygone days in the 1960's when me dear ole mum would cook up a pan of homemade stuffed cabbage. What a find! Meanwhile, Big Al celebrated his Polish and Italian roots by having an Italian hoagie, then washing it down with 6 pierogi. Our planes had some trouble getting off the tarmac. True LOVE! Thanks nice lady!"}
{"text":"Worst, and I mean worst gyro and cold fries of my life. Cucumber sauce was so sour it rendered my gyro inedible. Should have known better, the place was vacant at 5:45pm and the phone never rang while we were there. My complaint was met with a shoulder shrug and no apology or offer to correct. The Heinz ketchup bottles have been refilled so often that the caps are filthy and the product is multi colored. Avoid this disgusting hog wallow."}
{"text":"Worst tasting sub in the burg.  I threw it away and will hit Micky D's. Stale bread, dry meat, and an empty restaurant.  Stay far away."}
