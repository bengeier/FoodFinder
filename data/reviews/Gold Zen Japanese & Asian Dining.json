{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend last Saturday night.  We ordered gold zen roll,  rainbow roll , salmon tartar and beef tataki and bento box E.   The gold zen roll and the salmon tartar were exceptionally good.  I like the gold zen roll sauce so much that I asked for more and dipped my sashimi and sushi with it.   The atmosphere is great and the waitress was very friendly.  The overall experience was excellent, I would definitely recommend it to my friends and will go back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it was our worst japanese experience ever. Smelly salmon, lukewarm soup and watery salad. We demanded to cancel our order but the manager or owner (whoever he is) refused, IMO, it's a crime to serve such food to customers.  I already told all of my friends not to go there. I wonder how this restaurant can manage to get the GREEN PASS from Health Dept.!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to pretend to know anything about traditional Japanese food, or how sushi is supposed to be prepared, but I love this place for what it is. The portions are perfect, and all the rolls are perfectly bite-sized - no more awkward chewing a huge mouthful! And the best part is all the tempura and fried dumplings are so amazingly crunchy! The coating of the tempura is so crisp that it is water-tight, holding the dipping sauce in between the coating and the vegetables - delicious! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Too bad the owner is douche and won't let his waitresses keep their tips."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my kids and parents.  We were extremely disappointed with the food and service.  The salad dressing was so watery and tasteless that my mother and I both asked for extra.   I had a veggie sushi pizza that had no sauce or anything with flavour.  I asked for unagi sauce on the side which is usually sweet but theirs wasn't.  My parents both ordered the blackened salmon and it was so disgusting my mom wouldn't take a second bite.  The hot entrees took so long to come out.  And the waitress barely spoke English, an issue that was even more evident when she brought out (and charged us for) two salmon teriyakis in addition to the blackened salmon when we only ordered the blackened version.  I would not recommend this restaurant under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday and I was surprised by the friendly service and decor. It was modern but very casual. We decided to try this place after purchasing a voucher from DealFind.com.  I went here for lunch with my friend. We ordered the lunch special mines consisted of chicken terriyaki, spring rolls, rice and california rolls. My friend ordered the sushi and sashimi combo. We also ordered on the side, spicy salmon rolls and eel and cucumber rolls.   The presentation was very nice compared to AYCE restaurants. It was freshly made upon ordering and I thought the authenticity was 100%. The bill came up to 34$ so we had to pay 4$ plus tips since our voucher covered 30$.  I would definitely come here again. The portions is worth the price and quality of the food."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it was very disappointing. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was full but they only had one waitress and one chef serving the entire restaurant. I think we waited about 45 minutes for her to clear all the dirty dishes off our table and then another 20 minutes to get our drink orders.   The noise level was deafening! My friend and I moved tables so we could hear each other, but it made little difference. It's a good thing I wasn't starving when I arrived because I might have lost it. By the time our orders arrived we had been waiting for over an hour and the food wasn't a consistent quality. The sushi was pretty good but the scallops were seriously overcooked and drowning in a sugary soy sauce concoction.  The menu is miles long but it seems like they are trying to do too much. This area is very high demand and they are going to sink unless they hire more staff. The stairs to the bathroom should win an award for most likely to cause a fall and a broken neck."}
