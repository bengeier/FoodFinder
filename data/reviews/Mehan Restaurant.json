{"text":"How sad am I that Mehran closed!!!!!! ----------------------------------------  I'm new to the Toronto area and living in College Park. Living in the California Bay Area turned me into a true snob when it comes to desi food. I have a particular inclination towards north indian/pakistani cuisine as the flavors are just so rich. Its been a challenge finding places that match up to my expectations, but Mehran has met the mark. The flavor is spot on. The spice is perfect. The texture and ratio of ingredients is fantastic. Their naan is great. Plus, they rotate their selection often and I am always impressed that when I get a particular craving somehow they know and the item is there.  The other day I had a hankering for chana dal kadu. I bought a kadu at Loblaws and figured I'd go to Mehran and buy some chana dal curry and simmer some kadu into it. Low and behold - - they had chana dal kadu that day. Hello happiness.  Now, buyer beware, this is not a romantic restaurant spot. In fact, I think the average diner would be turned off just to see this place from the outside. It looks like a desi diner -- and I guess in some ways it is. The food is on display and you choose what you want and they heat it and pack it up. You can eat in, but don't expect a fine dining experience. Its ok by me, but I figure full disclosure is important."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant last night near Ryerson, open late from my friend They have the best deal for really good Chicken Wrap combo for only 4.99 with a pop. To see the food pics you can go here: http://phenu.com/mehranrestaurant.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"It looks like a diner and the choices are pretty simple but it's really good food, reasonable priced. The nan bread is warm and crispy, the food is well spiced but not too hot. I will definitely be going back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Surprising good food. Initially bought one samosa and walked out thinking it could not compare to a homemade version of the pastry I had previously enjoyed. Done with my samosa after walking a couple of hundred meters from the restaurant, I just had to come back from more. I was greeted with the same kindness and additional enthusiasm from the owner, and he recommended a the tikka masala. The naan was crispy, soft and warm. And the main course was delicious"}
{"text":"Get your combos while you can?   I was recently here and saw a bunch of businessmen walk through the place, measuring things, taking notes and looking in the kitchen.   Hopefully this place will stick around! Stay strong Mehran!"}
{"text":"The food is good, really. Great home-cooked meals. There is something to choose for vegetarians as well.  Price is good, as well. So is location if you feel like having original Indian food around Church area, please step in there. Quiet and clean place. Water jug comes with your order, so knock yourself out.   Service was good, as they took time and answered to our silly questions.   Not a fancy date restaurant, but for killing lunch hunger, I think it is the best.   After one time, we feel like not going back there...and not sure why, maybe there are other new places like that to discover?"}
{"text":"The naan was pretty good, but that's about all. When I ordered my food, the server started to spoon all the excess oil off the top of the chicken curry. This should've been a hint for me to not order anything.  I got the chicken kabob with rice, vegetables, naan, and a samosa.  The naan was good - different to other Indian restaurants that I've tried as there were sesame seeds in the bread.  The chicken and rice were ok, but really nothing special, and only 3 tiny pieces of chicken!  The ocra was way too oily  The samosa was also much too oily and too deep fried  What really put me off this place though is that the server put all of my food into a styrofoam container and put it in the microwave to warm up my food! Styrofoam can't be microwaved!!!   I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for 3 years now. The food is great, customer service is great. The owner himself is a very humble man. I just heard that he's closing stop at the end of febuary. I will be more frequent in visiting before I the shope closes."}
{"text":"Had the chicken biryani today. Full of flavour, hot, and tasted great! Will be back to try their chicken tikka masala (my personal favourite)."}
{"text":"Awesome Indo-pak food, that's really cheap.  This place is my spot for cheap eats after a night on Church Street.  It's on Church closer to Adelaide.  Not really hard to find. And parking is usually okay around that area.   There is not much as in decor for this place.  A decent amount of seating, which gets pretty busy at times when the bars close.  The food is already prepared, you pick out what you want up at the front counter and they bring it to the table for you.  The quality of the food is not the best that I have ever had.  But it's pretty damn good, especially when you had a lot to drink.    The staff is really friendly and the food is really cheap, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"After giving up on the wait at Guu ended up at this spot as right next to this busy Izakaya.  Initial idea was to just get a snack to and then go some place else but the consistent flow of people made me try this spot. I ordered a veggie samosa and Chicken Tikka Masala with a naan.  The service was prompt and my food was served nice and warm within a few minutes (not surprising as they seem to cater to a lot of cabbies)  The main course was greasy and was spiced OK. I was expecting a lot more spice at this spot. Meat was tender. Overall an average dish to fill up on. The veggie samosa was nuked at my request. Had a OK filling not spiced well again (surprised me as their clientele is not western) at buck a piece can;t complain much.  I didn't touch the salad.  Total damage a tad over 10$ so quick way to fill up in wee hours of the morning.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been going to this resturant ever since it opened somoetime in the 90s. There is nothing great about this place, but the food and that is all that matters. Mehran is as close as it gets to authentic Pakistani cousine.   Another benefit besides tasty food is it is open late, very late 4-5 AM 7 days a week. Naan and Roti is made fresh no matter the time.   Draw backs, washroom are dirty and in winter place is freezing and roasting in summer, but if you ask the owner he will adjust temprature for you.  With all these flaws the food is still work it."}
{"text":"Why have I not reviewed this place yet????  I've probably been here over a hundred times. It's one of our favourite spots to hit around 2am, because   a) It is right next to the barn (now called the marquis) and zippers, super close to walk from the village  b) its the perfect place to stumble too when you're incredibly intoxicated  c) Its the only indian place i know in the DT core that's open super late  how british of us right?  The food here is pretty standard fare indian/pakistani food.  Don't expect bells and whistles. Food's served on paper plates and cups.  The tandoori rolls are what we usually get, but I have drunkenly tried other items (which I totally remember...)  Filled with cabbies everywhere too.   Notes:  I've seen people throwing up outside this restaurant a number of times  You may get approached by the ...ladies of the night here (I have been multiple times)  Just have fun!"}
{"text":"Good:  1. Timing - Open late night 2. Food - specially Naan  Not so Good: 1. Variety - Hardly any variety"}
{"text":"Try some tasty homemade samosas as an appetizer while waiting to get into Guu. Mehran is home cooking, all the cabbies eat here - pretty tasty and very affordable. Might even just come here for dinner instead of Guu some day!"}
{"text":"You know this place is solid by the amount of circling cabbies. Open from dinner until around 5 am, Mehran has been around for a long time, and has survived a couple neighbours in this tiny two-store plaza (Mr. Tasty, anyone?). Interestingly enough, its newest neighbour is Guu, and I'm always amused to see groups of young Asians hungrily dining in here as they wait out Guu's painfully long lines.  I don't bother with the combos on the menu board, and a typical order is: one order of tandoori chicken (which consists of a breast and a leg); channa masala (chickpeas); and some naan or rice. Depending on how many others I'm dining with, there are plenty of options in the window, and these can change daily. The meatballs are a treat when offered. Meat curries and other veggies are all solid.  Tip: you can call ahead to order take-out. For some reason, it takes them 10 minutes longer to prepare your take-out order than it should, especially since the food is already prepared. The waiting sucks if you don't call ahead, but you can always people-watch the hungry crowds at Guu."}
{"text":"While waiting for Guu, we came here for an appetizer.  Unfortunately, the inside was pretty dirty...  Mehran was also a little pricey for $10/combo which comes with the entree and naan. The Butter Chicken was tasty (tender chicken, savory sauce), but it didn't even come with rice!  I probably would go elsewhere for that Indian food fix!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  I'm from Chicago, and found this great gem while visiting Toronto.  Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"LOVE their food!!!!  Super tasty, chef is from Pakistan and his wife makes such delis Items!!!  This Restaurant is a Dhaba. Mostly Taxi drivers come here as its open 24-7.  Location is shady bc its on church st and lots of prostitutes and hobos around the area.  Definitely not a family restaurant unless you go in the morning lol  Make sure you get their Chana masala and Butter Chicken Yumm"}
