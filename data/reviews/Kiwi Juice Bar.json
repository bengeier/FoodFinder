{"text":"The best smoothies I have ever tasted!  I work out just so I can get a healthy treat... I have had 4 different smoothies and my favorite is the PB Light. Yum!!!  Very friendly staff who cater to your nutrional needs and taste. The Kiwi Juice Bar is a must on your bucket list!"}
{"text":"If you're pre or post workout and you're looking to get educated on what your body needs to reach its goals, then you definitely need to check out Kiwi Juice bar. The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgable. They make you feel like old friends.   Not only do I frequently enjoy my post workout recovery smoothie; (Java Jolt with chocolate almond milk, Glutamine, and a scoop of espresso beans) but the staff actually showed me the benefits of adding a pre-workout drink to my workout. I was able to buy everything there!   Saddens me that 5 stars is the max, because Kiwi Juice Bar deserves a 10 diamond rating.   - Leo"}

You get the thirteenth free? That's up to another 7 bucks.  I am just someone who recognizes a good deal and Regina the owner was really nice too.

{"text":"Everything they make is delicious, and they can back up each \"smoothie\" with an extensive amount of knowledge toward each goal a customer would have. The owners are very personable, and approachable, I've used each one of them to better my knowledge of pre and post workout nutrition. Whether you get a smoothie, or not, they will help anyone, beginner, or advanced, with necessary information; as you can see, I couldn't be more impressed by a local business, well done!"}

{"text":"If you are looking for a smoothie that will fuel your body as you strive for fitness, you will find it here. Not only are their post-workout smoothies great for refueling, but they also have imported Italian coffee and healthy supplements to drink while you workout.   Atif and his sister really run a class smoothie bar. They also have various healthy fitness foods. They don't load their drinks up with sugar and yet they are really tasty. My favorite is the PBCup Lite. They use a low fat peanut butter powder and almond milk. Chocolate, of course, for me! Ask for the nutrition facts and any advice. They have the knowledge to go with their drinks."}
{"text":"Love this juice bar. The quality of the smoothies, supplements, etc. definitely outdoes the competition. Thank you Atif and Regina for adding a personal touch to every visit! So far all of the smoothies I've tasted has been delicious and would reccomend Carrot C for something light, Java Joe for coffee lovers, and Mango Crush."}
{"text":"This location being right inside the gym makes it super convenient for me to grab pre or post-workout fuel. There are several flavors to choose from depending on what I'm in the mood for and different options to add things like energy or protein depending on what I need. Regina is super helpful and nice, I found out she is a certified personal trainer as well so you can get some solid advice when you need it. Good to see someone that knows what they are doing also providing great products instead of just selling anything to save money."}
