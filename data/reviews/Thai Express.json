{"text":"Pad thai (beef)
- The beef used was tough and chewy. The pad thai was too saucy. Lunch special for pad thai is 6.59."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there's been a change in ownership or management but the quality has diminished. 

Example the pad thai is now watery and very limey. And no longer do they have packets of peanuts.

Disappointing."}
{"text":"It was a disappointing experience when I patronized the Thai Express at Bayview Village. I ordered a Noodle Soup and a Stir Fry. The noodle soup was so-so but the Stir Fry was a disappointment. This happened on Oct 25th afternoon - please refer to the attached picture of receipt. First, the chef thought it was just stir fry with no rice, and later on someone came over and put the rice back and gave the dish back to me with no apology. The Cashier was not interested in saying hello or trying to promote what's good in the restaurant. She didn't want to look at us in the eye - it's a bit rude honestly. Well, the owner smiled but that's the person who cared. 

Back to the Stir fry, take a look at what we got vs. what's up there on the menu board. The menu board stir fry looks a lot better - nice pieces of beef with broccoli and fresh veggie. Look at what I got! Lots of bean sprouts, which were not cooked very well. I was told it's the way they make it - it's Thai. Yes, it's true, but the bean sprouts reeks because it's not cooked well. Why? It's not fresh!!!!

Anyway, I was about to complain but when I checked out the Pad Thai another customer got across from my stable. It's merely two pieces of shrimp mixed with noodles. It didn't look too good either. I was like, well, I might as well save my breath. 

I mean, I have been a Thai Express fan since the day it was born. I like your Mini Soups and your Noodle Soups. Once in a while I visit your restaurants, but this time, it's the huge disappointment. Your menus aren't cheap. It's comparable to a fine dining Thai restaurant and I expect something better. 

If you wish to keep us as frequent customers, you have to do a better job."}
{"text":"Decided to give Thai Express a try after walking by many times during my lunch breaks @ Suncor Centre. 

Jason is right about the lineups - be prepare to wait for about 10 minutes or so during the 'lunch rush', but it is totally worth it. Been there two times, had the yellow curry shrimp and the cashew nut beef stirfry - in both times they were delicious and tasted really fresh. Prices are fair: portions are HUGE - reason why I always get the take away box, I'm never able to finish the whole thing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad red curry, until today. The flavour was gross, the appearance was blah and the vegetable selection was limited. The peanut sauce for the (bland) cold roll was too thick and lacked flavour."}
{"text":"I ordered pad Thai the taste was bad and the shrimps were not well cooked I didn't enjoy my meal couldn't eat it"}
{"text":"Better than other Thai Express in Montreal in my opinion. Not as insanely greasy, and tofu looked like tofu and not sludge from toilet like other Thai Express in MTL.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"We ate Pad Thai, Fried Rice and Yellow Curry.  Everything was delicious and people were very friendly."}
{"text":"I just went to this restaurant on Boulevard Taschereau, Longueuil, QC. I entered at 1:15PM nobody is on the counter and there is noise coming from the kitchen, after waiting a few minutes and as I was preparing to leave an employee (the cook) detects me and calls the girl from the cashier. I ask for \"A Tum yum soup with fish\" I repeated 3 times but she doesn't want to serve me in English so I had to say \"Une soupe Tum Yum poisson\"...I don't get what is the difference. The soup was served in a hurry, the noodles where hard, almost no soya sprouts and the fish...has no fish inside, just batter. I got 4 chunks of dough and a really poorly prepared soup. As I tried to complain to the cook I realize he doesn't speak French or English. I don't like to argue so I left and went to another restaurant.

This was the worse Thai Express experience ever. I know this is Montreal but the region of Greenfield Park is still half English speaking. Not only I was poorly served because I addressed the cashier in English but the quality of the food preparation was terrible. I will make sure I post this on yelp and other social media so that English speaking Quebequers will be advised to avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a pad thai but the cook forgot to put the sauce and there was no tofu. so just basically got oily noodles with no flavour. by far the worst thai express I have ever been to.

plus I ordered in French, so its not that they have a problem with language, they are just incompetent."}
{"text":"Wow I have to say I am impressed. Waking in to a fast food restaurant, I wasn't expecting much. But I have to say their service was very good. The cashier was super helpful and when the meal was cooked one of them even offered me to have a seat and that they would bring the food to me. I ordered a chicken pad Thai spicy. The fast was just write and it was not too saucy or slimy. There was plenty of taste and there was not too spice making me sweat. I would definitely come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"my chicken pad thai was terribly sour. Couldn't eat it at all. last two times i got the same items were much better. I don't know whats happened to this place. But i won't come again.may be u should train your staff  better. Saturday November 1st at 18-00"}
{"text":"When Thai Express opened in the food court in the Suncor Energy Centre just over a year ago, you could tell that everyone was excited at the prospect of something new to choose from for lunch. The first week it was open, the lineups were nearly an hour long! You'd think that after the first year the wait time would diminish as people's interest faded, but still every day at lunch, the line extends down the hall. Each dish is cooked to order, which is why it takes a little longer, but trust me - it's worth it! To speed things up, they always have someone come down the line with a printed menu, and they write your order selection on a piece of paper for you to just hand the cashier. Smart. 
I order Pad Thai every time I go. I'm totally hooked on the slightly spicy, slightly sweet mix of noodles, chicken, bean sprouts and egg stir-fried with sauce - it is exactly as I remember it from my Thailand vacation. Everyone else I know seem to choose one of the \"stoplight\" curries - red, green, or yellow curry with a variety of vegetables and your choice of meat. For each dish, you can control the amount of heat. I always ask for \"a little spicy\", and if you find it's not enough, they have a selection of sauces at the end of the line so you can doctor it up yourself. If you order your meal to go, it comes in a little Chinese take out container, and at first you think \"I paid $7.50 for this little amount of food?\". Trust me - if you dump the contents of the box onto a plate, you will be astounded at the amount of food they manage to fit in there!"}
{"text":"Had to wait in line two extra times while they attempted to fix my order. I have been a Thai Express fan in the past but lately when I make my order it's like people zone out and say yes when they really mean, 'I'll just make what I always make'

It was a total bummer considering everyone else in the food court that I was grabbing a bite with had finished their food by the time I got back to the table to sit down."}
{"text":"Worst pad thai I have had from a Thai Express.  There was no sauce no flavour, my pad thai was the same colour as eggshells!  I went after the lunch rush, but still that is no excuse for the horrible quality of your food."}
{"text":"Tom yum tasted off. Wasnt really spicy but had a hoooooorible stong taste of cilantro.  On top of that the cilantro was wilted and looked gross. Not fresh.

On the other note. WHO THE HELL PUTS CILANTRO IN TOM YUM IT DOESNT COMPLIMENT THE DISH. 
 
Not coming here again sorry but no. Worst tom yum ever."}
{"text":"A permanent lineup at York lanes; one of the few choices at York that is halal.  Food wise it's hot and tasty, from a fast food standard of course. I had mild green curry and was still sweating a lot. Under $10 (if you drink tap water) and your belly is stuffed.  Good place to grab a bite before class."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, AWFUL FOOD. I took my kids to Quebec for the first time for the long weekend, and we decided to go in. I ordered the Tom Yum soup which TASTED LIKE  THEY  SQUEEZED LAUNDRY WATER into the bowl and threw in some noodles. When we went to the counter to get our food, our server did not give us napkins, and I had to walk to the counter after we sat down to ask for them specifically. I swallowed something that looked like an imitation of shrimp, and tasted like RUBBER BREWED IN TOILET WATER. The server even dropped half of the veggies on the counter and then threw them into the soup before serving. My kids ordered the  general thai and general thairacha. Ok, you can't really mess up BOILED RICE. The chicken was passable for a fast food chain, but my kids complained of stomach aches for the rest of the day. The soup gave me diarrhea (I hadn't eaten anything before this) which got me acquainted with every other bathroom toilet in the Quebec old city. Heed my warning and stay away! or enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"The food is over price and served cold. Not impressed with staff that didnt try to recovered at all."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them one star is because I have no choice. 

Came here for lunch today, I got the stir-fry with noodles, started eating it was ok, not the best but just ok.  look down at my fork.... there is a hair mixed with my noodles, now I just wasted $9.50, still hungry cause I wasn't even close to half way.  I'm pissed, I waste my money, gas and time"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a high star rating because they have a gluten-free sauce you can request. While all Thai Express' should offer this - they don't (Queen and Bathurst location didn't even know what I was talking about!). 

There is one woman that works there that seems very educated about gluten free as well. 

This isn't a super authentic pad thai/thai place - - but the fact they have this gluten free sauce - creates a better option during your Eaton Centre shopping break."}
{"text":"I try to make healthy choices, so Thai food is a good decision. I sometimes go to Thai express and went to the ones downtown Toronto. They were ok. Today, I chose to go to Thai Express when in the mall in Sherway Gardens, Etobicoke. I noticed right away the meal was made in less than two seconds and it looked sloppy and pale. I asked the fellow ... 'it's done already\" ?... he just replied \"yes\". I looked down at the sloppy mess and decided I would try it. Well it tasted worse than it looked. I mean how hard is it to swish around some veg and some chicken, spray some sauce on it in a wok and make a reasonable product ? Anyway, my advice is to stay away from this place, the staff really have contempt for the customers. YUCK FOOD."}
{"text":"Gotta downgrade my rating since I found a hair in my food two visits in a row. Get some hairnets!"}
{"text":"Very quick, to the point where I almost feel rushed. I usually get their Pad Thai with chicken and it's usually delicious! It's sometimes a miss depending on the chef.. but generally it's really good.

I've also had their Pad Sew and Udon, I don't think that it's nearly as good as the Pad Thai but I always still hear other people order it so it might be just me. 

I also have to note that I'd had the Green Curry once, and that was HORRIBLE!!! Lol DO NOT try that. I usually love curry but that was just weird! It's frightened me to try the red or yellow curry.... I'm just going to stick to Pad Thai for now."}
{"text":"In a food category where most vendors pre-cook their wares and display it in heated bins, I love the idea of Thai Express:  being able to order, and have your meal prepared fresh in front of you.  

This is not the norm in a food court.  

Given the typical lunch hour line-ups at this location (routinely the longest by far in the area), I'm not the only one appreciating the concept.   But despite the onerous-looking wait times, Thai Express has a pretty slick operation in place to pull everything off.

The cooks manning the stir fry bowls are continuously turning over meals at a rapid pace, while additional prep staff staging fresh ingredients for the meals next up.  

As well, a second wait area exists for soups...  so those \"waiting\" are spread out along the counter.

In reality, the volume Thai Express deals with is pretty impressive.  

I've tried this location a couple of times now, and my take away experience is this:

First up was Pad Thai.  I sat down, and my initial impression was it was missing a few things.  No peanuts, no hint of lime, or even egg.  It was pretty bland.

That was mostly my mistake:  as a rookie, I failed to realize that there is a station off to the side that provides (yes) fresh limes, and ground peanuts, as well as hot sauces, etc. that you can add to your meal as desired.

My second visit led to the \"General Thai\" meal.   As the name hints, it was coated chicken and veggies on a bed of rice.  

Tasty, but I noticed the rice seemed like it had been \"drying out\" a little around the edges.  Not surprising, as they do have a lot of ingredients \"queue up\" for the massive lunch rush.

The verdict?  Well, I know I'll be coming back.  A lot.  Bottom line is there is enough on the menu to keep me interested, and returning repeatedly.  

When your choices ARE food fare, Thai Express is definitely one of the better options.

{"text":"My partner and I had an unfortunate experience here. We ordered the Thai red curry and chicken Pad Thai. When the red curry was served, the piece of the styrofoam plate that my partner was holding broke off, causing the plate to crash (food down) onto the very dirty cafeteria tray. The cook motioned for us to hand the tray to him, so we did - but he scraped the tray off into a new plate. We were not offered a replacement. Neither of us are much for confrontation, so we didn't say anything, but both of us felt that the response was uncouth, especially as it was their plate that was flawed. I did not eat the scraped off red curry - as a microbiologist, I am wary of filthy cafeteria trays. I did try a piece of the chicken, but it was very undercooked, so I had to spit it out. 

My partner wasn't a fan of his Pad Thai - he described it as \"not bad, but basically the same as a frozen meal\". I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We ate at the Carlingwood Mall franchise Aug 17th about 3pm. I've eaten here periodically when in a hurry.  Their facilities always seem clean and the service is what you expect from a fast food restaurant.  My son and I each had Pad Thai.  Generous portions is where my compliments stop.  At the restaurant, the photo of this dish includes a generous amount of green onion and peanut pieces.  However, neither of these key ingredients was anywhere to be found and I dug around! When I spoke with the man who served me, he assured me \"it's in there\".   Near the end of my meal I found one tiny piece of green onion about the size of a pepper corn, but never any indication that a peanut had ventured anywhere near the place.  If it had been a mistake, fine, we've all made them. But this guy was just bold-faced lying to me.  If my teenage son hadn't begged me not to embarrass him, I would have insisted on getting my money back. Steer clear of the place.  If they're lying about ingredients, what else are they lying about?"}
{"text":"Good food. I love their soups but I wish they put more veggies in it though. The pad Thai is also really good. They have Really big portions and fair prices. Every thing is fresh made right be for  your eyes."}
{"text":"This place doesn't honour it's posted hours, supposed to be open until 9pm seven days a week. Arrived around 8:45, the doors were locked, two men were cleaning up and they completely ignored me when I knocked on the glass. When I called the number, the voice message was full.
The food is ok, we go because the place is convenient just out of the transit, however Mr Thai a short walk up Yonge Street is just as good and open and friendly!"}
{"text":"OMG! they are opening a Thai Express near Beaver Creek in the plaza with Cora's and Tim Horton's. I love this chain! 

For those of you not familiar with the concept, Thai Express is not your typical fast food fare. Everything is made-to-order, where the food is freshly prepared after you order it and cooked in a wok in front of your eyes. Made to order Means you have the freedom to personalize your dish. 

The menu is simple and has a good offering of Thai dishes. There are 2 noodle soups (Regular and Tom Yum), 2 fried noodle dishes (Pad Thai and Pad Sew), 2 fried rice dishes (Thai and Basil), 3 curry dishes (Red, Green and Yellow), 7 stir-frys and a signature dish called General Thai. With each of these you can choose chicken, beef, shrimp (yum), vegetable, tofu or fish (double yum). There are also appetizers like fried spring rolls, fresh spring rolls and my favourite mango salad. 

Ordering is simple choose your dish (eg. Pad Thai), add your choice of meat (eg. shrimp, or you can ask for vegetarian if meat is not your thing), and specify the level of spiciness. That's it just wait for it to be cooked and you are in for a treat! 

I will post my impressions when it opens. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"You won't get good value for your money at this location.  The rice is bland and often not cooked properly.  They go light on the meats and there wasn't much basil in the dish that I got.  I also saw food handling practices that weren't the greatest.  The last time I went the shrimp I received tasted off.  I'll never go back - and my experiences at this location are putting me off visiting any Thai Express location."}
{"text":"Terribly stale food.  The chicken was inedible.  Informed manager as an FYI, even told him we didn't want money back or to get anything else but he still became defensive and flat out denied it was stale.  Terrible food and service."}
{"text":"I had pad Thai with tofu...very yummy!!  It was fresh and hot.  I didn't realize it has egg and nut  so if you prefer not to have these items you can just ask.  Also,  it was 6pm on a Monday and it was not busy."}
{"text":"Asked for pad Thai with very little sauce on it and it came out drenched    They say it is light suace and basically were rude.  Will never come here again

Also mentioned I wanted a certain dish and they say the price is higher than advertised.

Also with regards to the pad Thai we only asked for broccoli And noodle and light suace.   4 little pieces of broc only."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite fast food places. Great food, decent prices and great layout. I especially love their pad Thai. They can also moderate the spice level, I love spicy food!!"}
{"text":"I'd have given \"zero\" stars if I could... We hated the food here. All we ate was WAY too sugary! The sauces are premade, so we couldn't even ask for less sugar. Chicken, veggies & rice should NOT be as sweet as creme brûlée! Don't bother with any of the Thai Express chain restaurants. The 2 we tried were horrible. And the staff was curt, rude and discourteous. (btw, we eat Thai food frequently in California. None of it has ever tasted this sickenly sweet)"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Pad Thai was a heap of tasteless, gooey slop. Promised tofu was AWOL. Literally inedible. Straight to the trash can."}
{"text":"My  boyfriend  and I decided to go here for lunch.... Bad idea.  First off, we ordered in English and the cashier refused to speak English. Maybe she couldn't speak English or maybe she had something to prove. Either way, it was extremely rude. We each ordered a pad Thai beef (to go) It was  horrible. Super oily (the bottom was just oil it was really disgusting. They gave Him one tiny little piece of tofu. And as for me nadda... Without surprise, we  both got sick after eating it.(vomiting). What a waste of money. My advice -- Do not go there!!!!  If I could rate this a 0 then I would. How is it possible to keep selling food that is actually making people sick. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Here is another one of my regular lunch locations.  I always have the same thing.  I always have the stir fry ginger chicken spicy.  I always get it with no rice and just vegetables with hot sauce and hoisin sauce.  It's great lunch food. 

the food is always fresh.  They have these big flame woks and make it to order so its always hot and fresh.   They are very Thai and sometimes its hard to understand them but they know spicy so it always comes out with a little bit of a kick!

They are way in the back corner but there always seems to be a line up.  that usually tells me the food is good.  At least it is here!"}
{"text":"tl;dr: Don't go here.

You may think that you know how blah Thai Express usually is, but this particular location is worse than usual.

The staff makes sure you know that they are completely indifferent to you. When they mess up your order it should come as no surprise.  Food is mediocre quality and is very pricey for a fast-food place.  There are many Thai places around here that are better in every way, for a comparable price or less.

The only good thing that can be said about this place is that you will get your food fast because nobody is ever in there."}
{"text":"I always go here and every single time the food is amazing here!! 
The owner who is always surving us when we come
Knows exactly what we want! He is so nice and friendly. The food is made right in front of you and is so fun to see how they make it, everything is fresh and all the tables are super clean. Very cozy place and I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered steamed dumplings for my 2 year old daughter. Thought it was weird when she said she didn't like the inside and tried one myself. When I bit into it the meat inside was still raw. I went to tell the chef and he just brushes it off and tells me they are precooked. The meat was still pink and fleshy!!!! Absolutely no ownership of wrongdoing. Would not trust the food safety here."}
{"text":"Nourriture correcte pour le prix. Il s'agit plutot d'un fast food."}
{"text":"Villa Madina and Thai Express are decent for fast food.  Quick service.

From time to time I've gotten the wrong order from Thai Express, and the service at Villa Madina varies.  Sometimes I'm asked which salads I want, and other times they just pick random ones and don't even ask me.  Next time they do this I'll speak up and make them redo the plate.  Otherwise, I've been happy with the food."}
{"text":"Even though they apparently make the food fresh in front of you, it is still a bland brown mush.  Sitting here a couple of days later, I can't even remember what I had. I remember what it looked like - monochrome.  Checking my receipt, I see that it was veggie Pad Thai.

I could not identify any veg, they were cut so small.  Except onions, which were plentiful.  So, for. $8, I left still hungry, not satisfied in any way.  Except that the tea, which is free, was quite good.

Staff either didn't understand English at all or spoke English but just gave any old incorrect information to answer questions about the food.  Like another reviewer here, the tofu I ordered never materialized, but I didn't care to try to communicate with them again.

While eating, I watched the guy who made my food go out for a smoke (where he was visible just outside the window, yuck), and return to the restaurant without washing his hands and start to cook again.

Too expensive, not good, dubious cleanliness, won't go back."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap. Only good thing about this place.
Bland food. If I am consuming 900 calories I want it to taste good and/or be healthy. This food here is neither so I will not come back ever."}
{"text":"This is not just a bad review, its a warning to hopefully avoid people from getting sick. 

Note I have eaten at other Thai Express locations in the past. 

In 29 years, this is single handledly the worst food experience I have ever had. Not just eating out, food in general. 

I ordered golden curry (which was served with frozen vegetables, imagine a bag of green giant mixed frozen vegetables). About 5 bites into the meal I almost ended up putting a huge 3 inch piece of chicken fat in my mouth. I was so turned off I returned the dish to the franchise owner. This is the first time in my life I've sent something back. 

The dish was replaced with Pad Thai. The beef in the Pad Thai was the lowest quality beef I have ever eaten. It tasted like it had been soaked in 3 day old cooking oil. My friend tried a piece and immediately gagged. 30 minutes after eating this piece of beef and we both feel like throwing up still. 

In 15 minutes 3 other customers each returned their dishes as well... each time because the food wasn't edible. 

THIS IS A WARNING, NOT ONLY IS THE FOOD DISGUSTING, I BELIEVE THIS PLACE COULD GET SOMEONE SICK."}
{"text":"The food is over priced, the quality is sub par almost inedible. I ordered chicken and rice 
And half the plate is rice and the other have is heavily breaded chicken.. I can barely detect any chicken.. And it cost 10 bucks. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this location today and let me say, AMAZING.

It was not busy when I ordered so the cashier put in the time and effort to help me choose what I wanted. When I said that I'd come back she did not make a fuss about it like some stores do.

I ordered the Thai Chicken Fried Rice and it was mouth watering. It only took about 1-2 minutes to make but it was worth the nine dollars. I appreciate the positive attitude that the cook had. When he was done packing the rice, with the biggest smile he said, \"Chicken Fried Rice, I hope you enjoy it!!\" it was so cute. 

Please keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I'd be cautious about eating here if you're at all concerned with sanitation and health codes. While the place itself is new and in a beautiful building, the employees were clearly not following any form of sanitary procedure. I asked for tap water and they said they were all out. I asked how they washed their hands, and they said they didn't and laughed. I also saw them playing with their phones and then putting food back in the pot with their hands. Disgusting.  

I ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Had the General Thai and Pad Sew. It doesn't stand out in my mind, but for fast food, I really can't complain. Decent amount of meat, veggies were crisp and fresh. 
I may come here again, but I may also consider what else I could get for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Thai Express is one of the places that I would not mind going when I need food quickly or when I simply do not want to cook for the night. I tried this one and ordered for a to-go. Now I do not plan to go back at all because of two reasons.

First, it's dirty. The place is really dirty that I could see flies on limes (yes, they were sitting on them) and the ceiling.. It looked like they do not clean until the store closes. It was a bit.. disgusting.

Second, it's salty. VERY salty. Food was very oily too. The to-go box looked like a garbage can after it dried... I actually couldn't finish eating because it was too salty. I had to drink at least 1L of water after to remove that salty feeling on my tongue..."}
{"text":"Horrendous service!

I was there before 8:30pm - well before the 9pm closing time.  However, judging by the attitudes of person at the cash, it was as though I had committed a crime for making him and his staff work extra while they were cleaning up to close the store.  The man at the counter was more concerned about his packing/cleaning duties than taking the order.  After I placed my order (Fried Rice - Chicken with extra vegetables on the side), I asked him to change the order to Fried Rice - Vegetables with extra chicken on the side.  My assumption was that the extra side order (for which I was charged $2.50) would come in a separate container.  However, instead of explaining how the dish would be prepared, I was asked point-blank \"what's the difference?\".  I don't know what the difference is but I would definitely know if I worked at a Thai Express restaurant.  And even if I didn't, I would not be asking the customer that question!  I would have still taken the incident kindheartedly but the attitude of the person was deplorable to say the least.  But I was with my family so I decided to let it slide.

 

After the food was prepared (we took it to go since we could tell the people we overly anxious to close the store as they had already stared sweeping the floors and putting the chairs away), I asked the cook if he already included the chicken.  He didn't bother to reply.  So I asked him again.  Still no reply as though I didn't exist.  Finally on my way out, I asked the man who had initially \"served\" me and he replied in an annoyed tone that it's already included with the plate. 

 

That's when I told him about the shitty service they just provided.  His excuse was that the cook does not speak English.  I am perfectly bilingual.  So if the cook replied to me in French, I would have responded in kind.  However, it was one horrible customer service after another.  To top it off, I came home to discover that quantity of food is nowhere near what I have come to expect from Thai Express.  In fact, my food was not packed in a regular Thai Express box for take out.  It was served in circular plastic boxes even though there were plenty of regular branded boxes in sight behind the counter.  Even the ingredients in each plate were minimal at best. 

 

There are a number of other restaurant is one the same strip of road where the Thai Express is.  Every one of them were full of customers on a Friday night.  Except for this Thai Express which was completely empty.  If this is the level of service your franchisee regularly provides, I have no doubt in my mind why most people decide to stay away from the store.

 

Obviously I am never going back there again."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the service! The woman behind the cash is bitter and rude! Please do NOT WORK IN FOOD SERVICE if you hate people! Maybe smile once in a while? I felt that she resented any customer coming in and daring to order! The soup spoons are so ridiculously small that it took me an hour to get half way through my soup. I left the rest. Also, why oh why do they only give a customer ONE napkin? Is it coming out of their paycheque?"}
{"text":"The food here was fine, but the service is abysmal! The nasty man behind the counter took my money and GRUNTED at me when I dared to ask for a napkin! He hates his job and should probably work where he does not have to speak to anyone. RUDE RUDE RUDE!"}
{"text":"The food here is soooo tasty! Fresh and wonderful! The owner and staff are as nice and helpful as can be!!"}
{"text":"Thai express has been consistently busy since it opened with regular line ups.  I have only eaten a fresh spring roll... Which was really tasty although I received a thick peanut spread to eat with it which was a bit odd.  My friends really enjoyed their food from here."}
{"text":"This spot is basically nothing special, particularly for the noodle and rice dishes.

However! I think I've come upon a little gem since discovering the small-sized soups. It's not on the menu, but they definitely do them. They are the perfect size for lunch. The normal soup is about $3.75 and the tom yum is about $4.07 or so and the flavours are great. The tom yum is usually fine as-is but I like to jazz up the normal soup with a squeeze of hoisin, hot sauce, lime, peanuts and the like from the other end of the counter. And because it's the small size, you don't end up feeling bloated from over-eating noodles and fried rice.

Just a tip!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai express ever. 

The workers were too busy socializing with the other employees to notice people in line. Also the food was terrible. The meal was so over cooked. Ended up throwing it away. To add to that all, the place also was very dirty. 

Will never be back to this location. Take the walk to the location at the urban eatery if you want good Thai express."}
{"text":"Not worth it unless you want to overpay for a serving of mostly noodles.  Skimpy chicken in my Pad Thai and the bits that were there tasted tough.  Disappointing since the Thai Express at King east of Yonge is superb."}
{"text":"Pricey, the cooking area is kinda clean. There is a hand washing issue here! 

I'm sure the wok kills most of the germs but there is defiantly a sanitary issue here. 

Won't be back to chance fate. 

Be warned."}
{"text":"Wooohoo! Pad Thai! My favourite!
The Pad Thai here is probably the best I have ever had ranging from Yorkdale Mall to other random restaurants that does delivery (we all have those lazy days, right? lol) And I got to say, I can never ever go to another thai restaurant.  I love the Shrimp Pad Thai with Medium Spice and Peanuts! Delicioussss! :)

I would say the sauce is perfect, and the flavour is absolutely to die for! I highly recommend this place! The best Pad Thai ever!"}
{"text":"This Thai Express is a newer branch, and probably the closest one to where I live.  The food here is average however the cashier is exceptionally rude and I felt very rushed when I was ordering.  I ended up ordering just the usual Beef Pad Thai, it lacked sauce so it tasted rather plain but what can you expect from a branch.  IMO, the one at Square One is a lot better in terms of taste, and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and the food was decent. A little pricy for the portion size but not bad as far as taste: The staff are lovely however the last two occasions I've visited this establishment it has been closed early. On my most recent visit it was only around 8:30 and they were closed which contradicts the website."}
{"text":"This is the chicken Pad Thai with medium spiciness level.

Generous portion for $9.68 +tax. I like the flavour too. Being able to customize the spiciness level is also a plus. Note that their \"spicy\" level has a decent level of spice already, so try not to go overboard if you're unsure if you can handle it.  I usually prefer to get the \"spicy\", but decided to tone it down a notch just for today. I wouldn't recommend the chicken though, since it was over cooked and dry.

Most orders can be customizable by following these three simple steps:
1 Choose your protein: shrimp, beef chicken, veggie, tofu, fish, battered chicken, sautéed beef
2 Choose your main entree: noodle soup, pad Thai, etc.
3 Choose your spiciness level: mild, medium, spicy, very spicy

Definitely a good option if you're looking for something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Ce petit resto franchisé est l'endroit parfait  pour manger rapidement et à prix plus que modiques. Je n'ai que rarement mangé un pad thaï au tofu aussi gros pour moins de 8$... Normalement on me sert ce genre de plat avec 4 ou 5 decevants morceaux de tofu, mais cet etablissement a très bien compris mon grand besoin de protéines!

L'endroit est propre avec un décor design et aseptisé de franchise. 

Dans ce genre, on ne fait pas mieux."}
{"text":"It's the worst Thai Express. Very bad customer service. I told the girl I wanted my meal to be spicy (she is supposed to ask me but she didn't so I said it myself). After I didn't see her put it on the bill, I asked her: it will be spicy right? She said yes. And guess what? Not only it wasn't spicy at all, but the pad sew was so dry. I took a take out so I couldn't waste more time to go back. She charged extra when I asked for a bowl instead of the usual tight box when the other Thai Express don't do that. Not only I didn't get something worthy of the money I was paying, the cashier was just busy chattering with her colleagues and didn't pay attention to giving the right service."}
{"text":"This use to be a good place to eat. Now though either staff were changed and they dont know how to cook because the chicken that is used tastes awful and the meal is a sloppy mess. They need to get back to good ingredients and take more time with their cooking methods."}
{"text":"Well cooked food and good service is an afterthought at this restaurant. 

The General Thai I had was very dry and overcooked and felt like the same amount of care went into making them as chicken mcnuggets do at McDonalds, they might even be worse.

Service was poor, attitude and a lack of communication for the employees up front.

I do not recommend, not going back, very good and much better authentic Asian restaurants nearby, save your money for them instead."}
{"text":"I had to wait in line for a long time before I could order but the pad Thai was okay but also wasn't made fresh. I could tell because in like 2 minutes I got ny pad Thai which wasn't really good"}
{"text":"This is a takeout place as well as you can sit in for your lunch and dinner.  I like it because the chef is standing behind the counter and when he cooked, you can see the fire burning high while he is cooking step by step first the oil, then the sauces, and the egg and then the pad Thai.  The dish is very hot when it is delivered.  Sure do have to watch for your lips and tongue!

I am always wondering how the plastic container can sustain such a high temperature."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick dinner so we drove into the mall at Dufferin and Steeles.  We settled on Thai Express.

When I looked at the menu above the counter, I found them a bit pricy when compared to the downtown food courts.  We ordered a Pad Thai and a curry chicken rice.  The Pad Thai noodle is not really Pad Thai.  I had so many Pad Thai in different Thai restaurants.  The Pad Thai was stir fried too long like braised noodle.  The taste was weird.  The curry was better as least it was hot from the frying pan. 

Overall it is pricy and if you want any Thai food, don't even think of this fast food restaurant.  It is just not Thai"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is multiplying all around the city. The food is really poor. Noodle dishes are mostly noodles and oil. Rice dishes have the same sauce. pad Thai has very little but noodles. Save your money."}
{"text":"I get that this is airport food...I get that there aren't a lot of options... but this is bad bad bad. 

Here's how the experience goes: you place your order at the cashier. You stand and wait 20 to 40 mins for them to get to your food (while listening to everyone around you complain). Periodically the preppers will cough on whatever they are making. Some people will leave to catch their flight when they run out of time.

When you get you food it is limp, overcooked, and oddly seasoned. Make sure you don't deviate from the menu (e.g. ask for no broccolli) because you'll get a giant huff and a glare.

In the end, I'm not sure my beef was even beef and after eating my stomach hurt worse than when I was hungry. Honestly, you're better off leaving and eating nothing."}
{"text":"Had the the Thai Beef Soup.  (Extra Spicy).  The place was pretty dead but that just may have been the time that I went there.  It was my first time trying this soup.  It was not bad but I still prefer the Tom Yum.  Staff are friendly and the place was clean.  This place also has halal beef and chicken."}
{"text":"I always go for the tom yum soup with chicken when I go here. Just over $10 by the time you're cashed out. They put tons of chicken in there and more soup than you could ever drink. The broth is well balanced and better than you would expect from food court Thai food. It's made by Chinese people, but authenticity doesn't bother me (and what do you expect anyway, you're not in Thailand)."}
{"text":"I picked a vegetarian dish and lettuce had that musty mildewy not washed properly taste 
never again"}
{"text":"I just tried to eat here now at 8:25pm...and they're closed!! The door is locked and the two employees are cleaning up. The one employee looked at me and quickly looked away. I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I came to this place twice in four days, its that good.  I had the general thai and really enjoyed the fresh taste of the food. It had onions, peppers, and pineapples, with chicken.  They make it right in front of you and it takes about 3-4 minutes.  Only issue is when it gets really busy you might have to wait up to 10 minutes, which is frustrating if you are looking for fast food.  Loved the food!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Loved  the prompt service. Food is prepared fresh to order.  Spice level was exactly what I asked for. The coconut flavoring was not overbearing.  There was a great overall balance of spices/flavors.  Lunch Portion was just enough to get full and share if your in that mood."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai Express. I've been eating here regularly and it's always clean and the staff is courteous.
Also newly made so its a pretty fancy setup"}
{"text":"Ignorant ppl who work here and yes it's the rude guy during the week, he is rude stay away they don't even cook your food cause they don't care and they don't seem to like ppl at atll"}
{"text":"Delicious. Thai Red Curry vegetable is pictured. The restaurant was clean. The staff was courteous and helpful.  I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Worst Thai Express.

I've been here at least 3 times before to get some food, only to find no one here. came today at 7:45pm (they close at 9:00pm on a Thursday) sign on, door opened, but no a single employee to be found.

so annoying, I wonder if the owner knows that the employees are MIA and they are losing potential sales? 

done with this place, the few times ppl we're actually here working and I managed to get food, it tasted good, but the service too unreliable.

Fail"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! I have ever had an issue with the wait time - food always comes out within about 5 minutes. I like that they make it in front of you, and they have no problem with special requests. Staff is friendly, and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I was turned onto Thai Express 10 years ago, however most food court Thai Expresses are not that great, and this Thai Express in Northland Mall is another reason this franchise is going downhill.  Average customer service, however the quality of the food is very poor on the Thai Chicken Fried Rice I ordered for $9.68.  It was all fried rice and barely any chicken, and limited vegetables, 10 bucks for this?!?  I will not eat at this Thai Express in the future, I am sure the workers don't care, however the owner of this store should start making corrections if they expect to stay afloat in the future!"}
{"text":"Can't understand the cashier, don't provide chop sticks or napkins- you have to ask for it. No hoisin sauce. Good food though."}

You should try them blc there are Bomb the cream tea is also great to try

{"text":"I was so excited about eating here, so when I went in I ordered my meal, Pad See Eww, I told the girl at the register,  just noodles and broccoli. We went over this a few times, asking me if I wanted this, or that? No, just noodles and broccoli. I am watching the cook make it up and I asked her, is that my order? She says yes. It had everything but the kitchen sink in it. I tell her no, thats not right, so she goes to make it again. The owner or manager comes out and I tell him what is going on. The cashiers comes out and says of your ordered the vegetarian meal. NO, I ordered Pad See Eww, you asked me if I wanted that one. It was so frustrating. So I say, just give me my money back. The owner says, would you like me to make it for you? I said sure give it a go.... Holy crap, no on in there could get it right, he starts telling me, you want this and this, and I said, No! Just give me my money back. It was a charge card, but he could not figure out how to refund it, so he tells me, I will just do it later and you can look and see on your bank account that I did. I said, what? No, I don't think so, just credit my card back. He apparently wasn't trained to do returns, so he just gives me the cash back. I would have loved to try it, but I was too upset to, so I guess it will be some time before I decide to even go back. The cashier had no idea what she was doing either. Just a hot mess."}

{"text":"You may not think that Mediterranean and Thai cuisine are a match made in heaven but their franchises in one building is! The pair, Villa Madina and Thai Express, have come together in a harmonious marriage on Yonge Street. 

4 Stars for some fast food? Yes. I came in fully expecting to get some cheap, fast Thai food but was hustled in the most endearing way to go for the Mediterranean. The close competition betweens them actually breeds amazing service. When Villa Madina, saw where I was leaning but saw me spying on them too the man made a promise of \"the best shwarma ever\" and I was smitten enough to try it out. I felt like I was in the middle of a love triangle, for the Thai Express man was very nice as well. But I was intrigued by all the fresh-looking salads that were at Villa Madina, so I went for a chicken shwarma plate. 

The man had an uncanny way of knowing what I wanted. I got to pick three (!) salads with my chicken shwarma, as well as receiving hummus, garlic sauce, pickles, turnips, tomato and pita bread. All for under $10 and it was enough for two meals. Each salad (tabouli, Greek and a cabbage one) was crisp and delicious, exactly what I always want to stuff in my shwarama but there always seems to be an extra charge with it. The chicken was also very tender (could have been a touch warmer) and came with spicy sauce and tahina upon my request. Even while paying, you really got the sense that they were taking care of you. 

This is a grand location, two floors with plenty of seating. It's new, quick and full of people that are eager to please. For fast food, this is top shelf."}

Felt like staying in one day and decided to do pick up from Thai Express with my sister. They only have 5-7 main dishes avail so we didn't get much choice. We went with Shrimp Pad Thai and Chicken Green Curry + 2 Spring Rolls. The bill came to around $21.00 and tip was not necessary because it was a pick up. Pad Thai was alright with 4-5 medium sized shrimp but a little too ketchupy tasting. Green curry was creamy with the coconut milk base but because of the way take out box is made, rice was all mushy on the bottom. However, it is located just across from my house and if I wanted a quick meal, I wouldn't mind trying something else again."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is unpredictable -- in the sense that it's either slow or incredibly broken. I've ordered food and then stood in line for over 20 minutes to collect it as the staff wrestled with the volume of orders and their own cluttered indifference. The location  under 4 King W is far more reliable."}
{"text":"Will not return! Service was extremely slow. They also did not give me my complete to go order. The food was mediocre and the staff is odd. Everyone was hovering over the cashier every time an order was taken. I was looking forward to thai express opening."}
{"text":"First time coming to Thai express, the food was really good. I ordered chicken pad Thai while my husband had the Tom yum soup. Both of us really enjoyed what we ordered, my husband requested a side of rice but they didn't have it on the menu so the manager was nice enough to let us have some for free. We will definitely be coming back.

Pros- yummy food and quick service, also the staff was very nice.

Cons- attention to the manager, it was very slow when came in, and three tables had dirty dishes on them while all of the staff was behind the counter talking. 

( they've only been open a week so I'm sure they are still working out the kinks)"}
{"text":"Another win in the Davisville neighborhood. Yes it's fast food, but it's good fast food. Prepared in front of you, with the fire rising up from the Wok; damn that would make a nice picture. Ordering is easy, and your meal is prepared hot, delicious and ready to go in no time flat. Check it out, you'll become a fan too. Oh yeah, there's also a Mr. Sub in the same restaurant, how kick ass is that!"}
{"text":"Its the McDonalds of Thai food, its fast, its eazy, except its not that cheap.   I over the padthai with with beef chicken & shrimp, all the proteins were pre cooked and had no seasoning, the sauce they used was rather blan."}
{"text":"My new go to thai food! I haven't had anything else around here that is even half as good. For real. So good. I had cashew stir fry with chicken.

 I just finished lunch and kind of want to order some to go for dinner. But I wont. Ill just come back again for lunch tomorrow. 

My veggies tasted nice and fresh. The chicken was cooked just right. My food came up pretty quick. Not 1000 degrees to where I had to wait a long time to eat it.
I got spicy. It had some kick. Next time I am going extra spicy.

It was dead a little after lunch time but I doubt this place will stay dead very much longer. Its to good. 

Its pretty casual. Order at the counter then take a seat. 

There is a few options for food in this plaza but I seriously doubt ill go to any of them again now that Ive eaten here. 

This place hit the spot for me and I obviously recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Boring night, not wanting to go far, I decided to go back. Ordered the General Curry with green curry and I have lots of regrets. The battered chicken was just so dense, obviously preprepared and stored in the fridge, or worse the freezer. Really? I can just buy a TV dinner instead, people. If you don't care about the food, why do you think I'm going to be back? I should have had a hot dog!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed them. I was able to basically create my own curry!!! It was perfect!! The flavors are great and the service as amazing! I had yellow curry with the general chicken I had them put onions, pineapples, and basil in my curry! It was so good! Next time (which will be today, I just ate there last night.) I will have it with shrimp because the general chicken was good but was in the way of the curry to me. I also had the Thai chicken wings and they weren't too bad, I've had better though. All in all I would highly recommend this place and I will be a regular! Hey also have a rewards program and I love a rewards program!"}
{"text":"Got the pad Thai, looks like most people complaining are used to American thai/fake Thai food. The pad thai tastes like pad Thai, not exactly like pad Thai but good. No ketchup taste like other places! 

Good portion for the price, most people are thinking it's less due to the shape of the box. If you weight the food on a scale or pour it out it's pretty much the same amount of food in a regular Chinese takeout box (rectangular styrofoam). A bit less but it's not a huge difference. Maybe 15-20-% less and thai express charges  20% less than other Chinese takeout places for pad Thai so it ends up being around the same. (Thai express charges $8.98 and other Chinese restaurants charge $11.00+) 

be sure to order one spice level below what you think you want. I got spicy and I would say it's similar to flaming hot Cheetos spicy. More spicy than jalapeño chips."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Thai and it wasn't that great. Nothing really jumped out at you on of the only things that kind of drew my attention was the chicken dumplings, but that's just cause I love dumplings. Other than that it was okay at best. The pad soup was pretty bland, and the pad Thai(beat) was kinda just brown salted mush. The yellow general curry (breaded chicken) was good, if you like cooked pineapple."}
{"text":"Bubble tea was good, but watery.
Villa Madina - absolutely horrible :( falafel tasted like flour with baking soda and I'm not sure about humus, I think it had gone bad. Had to dump it."}
{"text":"Extremely bad value.  My meal seemed like 90% rice, no substance.  I've been to many other locations, this was shockingly bad."}
{"text":"I only give this place 4 stars because it has a very modern and upbeat look to it but some of the trash cans were overflowing and I did feel bad about throwing away my trash. I loved everything else about it.
Great yellow general curry along with some different spice level choices. Basically between levels 1-5 with 5 being the highest. I would go here again for sure. Very quick service as well if you are looking for a good take out place."}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai noodle here is fantastic.

Always tasty, hot, affordable, and quick!!

My favorite!

But their shrimp tomyum soup is not that great."}
{"text":"Doesn't even taste like Thai food. Abysmal. If anything it tastes more Chinese. Pad sew noodles needed way more fish sauce."}
{"text":"I had the tom yum soup and the pad sew ew. The tom yum soup was weak in flavor, was salty, and the chicken was bland. Some of the cilantro pieces in the dish could have been fresher. I probably shouldn't have high expectations for a thai place in a mall. However, their pad sew ew was acceptable with a strong soy sauce flavor."}
{"text":"I'd give the place zero stars if possible. It smelled like dog when we walked in! I had to step outside while my bf ordered his food. He got the pad see ew to go and when we got home he took one mouthful and threw it away. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife and her sister... the total was $32 for three main dishes, two spring rolls and one drink. Firstly, not a good value at all - a sit-down Thai place would have similar prices and you wouldn't have to get up to get the food yourself.

Second, they served everything in styrofoam and plastic. No, hot soup in a plastic bowl is not good for your health. Hot noodles and rice over styorofoam is not good, either. It seems that this location used generic throw-away cutlery and dinnerware; the only thing labeled Thai Express was the cup and napkins. It was hard to drink my soup with the tiny plastic spoon or to eat the noodles with the tiny plastic fork...

The taste of the food was pretty decent, however. The fried rice was good. The chicken rice noodle soup was pretty good, with Tom Yum soup. The Pad Thai, however, was really below average. Not very flavourful at all. The spring rolls tasted kind of disgusting as well, with the insides all mushy and undercooked.

And how about the service? Well, it was neither here-nor-there. The chef was friendly, but the cashier did not smile at all and was not friendly.

If it was about 30% cheaper, I might consider coming back."}
{"text":"I occasionally visit this Thai Express when I can't be bothered venturing outside for lunch, and it's pretty ok. The lineup can be long but it moves fast. I always enjoy the red chicken curry but I'm always extremely thirsty afterwards as it's very salty.

A solid three stars and a reliable bet for lunch when you just want something fast and reasonably cheap."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty! Served hot and spiced to your taste. I took the tom yum shrimp soup this time. It's fresh, it's hot and spicy, and price is fair too. 

If you are very hungry, add an extra tofu, chicken of beef for a little bit more than $2.00

Try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst deal of all in recent memory.
It's clear, this place is trying to sell itself as a healthy, urbane lifestyle alternative for the yuppie on the go. 
IT'S F*#^%NG THAI FOOD!

First of all, I am almost certain the Thai people do not live on the stuff offered on the menu here.  Let's consider this, one of the most hard working people on the planet, a Nation that invented one of the most hardcore, bone-crushing, scary-ass martial arts, and you are telling me they live on noodles, green onions, and underdeveloped shrimp?!

Sixteen dollars, that's the cost of my food.  A main dish, plus a side and a drink. 
The soup always taste funny.  what is that sour taste that goes into every bowl of noodle soup? I don't think mint tastes like that. maybe it's the lime...I got a whole thing on lime..but that's another story for when somebody stupid enough decides to open a business using that superfluous fruit. 

This place is the décor replicate of the sandwich box.  
There is semblance of service, it's a kitchen line.  I had more hospitality at the Socialist canteen.  Actually...that's a cheap shot...Socialist kitchens in Communist industrial Countries are pretty friendly.  You know what I mean!

I heard about Thai Express first from my friend Lucia.  
\"Omg, Thai express it's sooo good.\"  She always wants to go to Thai Express, and having no idea what it is, I never relented having fear of restaurants that name themselves anything 'express'. 
Finally, I had no choice.  I didn't to feel like a fatty, so I avoided the Pusateri's cooked food section.  Where is the meat? The food wasn't good!
THAI PEOPLE EAT MEAT!!!!!
This is Manchu Wok for Thai people!

SIXTEEN DOLLARS FOR FOOD COURT FOOD!
That's not Thai Express, that's American Express!!"}
{"text":"Even if Thai Express is mall food per se, it's probably some of the freshest I've had in a long time, prepared right in front of my eyes. For our lunch, my friend had some spicy fried rice, while I had the veggie pad sew on the spicy side. I always have been a fan of the wide noodles. The serving portion was just right on for me for lunch last weekend, as I was pretty hungry. So should I make another visit to Chinook Centre, I'll be sure to consider Thai Express as a quick meal."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible fast food. I get that it's Thai Express but the pad thai was greasy, way too sweet... just gross. GROSS.

I also took the General Tso's chicken (WHY?!).. and found it equally disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. I ordered the Thai rice noodles with vegetables and chicken and what ended up on my plate was plenty of noodles without a lot of chicken and veggies. My meal did not taste good either and had no flavor. Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"The place itself is a little too small, and the chairs and tables are placed very closed to each other (perhaps too close, making movements almost impossible).

I ordered the beef fried rice and my girlfriend had the general thai. I ordered mine extra spicy and oh boy those chilis were HOT. So hot that I can barely taste anything else (coming from a guy who feeds on spicy Sichuanese cuisine almost daily). I still managed to finish the plate but my suggestion is to never ask for extra spicy in this place because their peppers are much, much hotter than any other Thai Express.

The rice I had was not properly separated, meaning that I had many \"clots\" of rice grains that were tasteless. In addition, the chicken from the general thai was over-fried, such that it was a bit too hard to bite.

Final verdict: given it is fast-food place, it is really not that bad."}
{"text":"Cashier has really bad attitude, general Tao is way too sweet and portion is way too small."}
{"text":"grabbed a quick bite after tennis workout... fast service, decent food, GREAT proportions!!

I'm pretty sure the cook is Laos so the flavor palette was a little off for me then what i'm used to for Thai food. But at the same time this place is a quick stop and go food pick up situation. 

Beef Pad-See-Ew, Chicken Pad Thai and Basil Fried Rice were ordered.. all were good, the Bail FR was amazing."}
{"text":"Really great food and prices!! The staff is nice and fast. I got veggie pad Thai and it wasn't greasy at all"}
{"text":"If it wasn't accessible from within my work building, and if the windchill wasn't -33 degrees Celsius, I would never return. I actually much prefer the country style in the same room, the sandwiches are better, the service is slightly better. 
It's overpriced noodles/rice with ketchup or watery sauce and way too much onion/green pepper. Not very good at all. Take your money to the New Thai restaurant down the street next to sobeys instead. Better prices, better food, better service all round."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas de la grande gastronomie, mais c'est idéal pour les dîners ou soupers express comme le nom l'indique. C'est une bonne alternative pour des repas sur le pouce ou tout simplement des repas plus longs, mais à prix plutôt modiques."}
{"text":"Best dish is pad Thai! It's always been one of my favourites even compared to actual sit in restaurants. Tip: their soups come in small sizes (still a hefty portion) for half the cost!"}
{"text":"oh my god, worst Pad Thai I've ever had in my life. Tastes like nothing, just greasy noodles (not even glass noodles like Pad Thai should have?), tough overcooked tofu. I  guess you get what you pay for but wow. I think the other reviews are fake, there's no way anything good came from this place."}
{"text":"Had their pad see ew with chicken and shrimp. Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The workers here are exceptionally friendly. The cook creates a lot of smoke when he cooks which makes me cough. The smoke smell stays in my hair and clothes, but the food tastes good."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the Villa Madina half of this dual establishment. I've only eaten at Thai Express.

This is the same Thai Express found in food courts. They have the usual pad thai, curry and tom yum soup. The pad thai is very good and the portions are big.

The seating area is huge, with two levels. The walls are glass which allows an entertaining view of Yonge St.

While waiting for Salad King to reopen, this is a decent alternative.

The last time I was there, incongruously, trance-techno music was playing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Delicious! My new favorite restaurant. I tried it first using Postmates. It was so incredible that I had to go in later that week for more. The soups are so delicious and give me this cozy feeling. The pad thai is beautifully seasoned and excellent every single time. My favorite Thai place in Vegas for sure! You will not be disappointed."}

Service: 4/5 Fast and friendly. 
Environment: 4/5 Okay.
Washrooms: N/A
Worth it?: 4/5 Not fats but fast enough for lunch. 

I come here for lunch occasionally. The lady at cash seems to be yelling at your but I feel like she's just trying to be clear and fast. Thats what I pretend to feel better anyways. The rest of the staff is very friendly and prepares your meal in front of you. 

The line up is long at lunch time but does move quickly. Items are made to order so that part does take time. 

The noodle and rice dishes come in boxes which may be hard to eat out of but it's worth it if it's what you are looking for. I would pass on the soup dishes as they are quite bland and boring. 

Not a place I will be a regular at even tho I work in the building. I do know some people that go once a week so it's worth a try if you are around for lunch often."}
{"text":"Decent thai fast food, never had any problems. They will make things veg if you ask. They run specials on new dishes pretty frequently. There is a large clean dinning area. There's also a Villa Madina Mediterranean food inside. Nothing spectacular but better than burgers."}
{"text":"Great staff and clean. Food is always fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend for a quick lunch or supper."}
{"text":"The takeout is basically 90% rice and 10% actual ingredients.  There was like 3 carrots, 2 slices of onion, and a few pieces of chicken sitting on a tonne of rice.  Not a very appetizing or healthy meal - and extra for broccoli?  

Definitely avoid as there are a tonne of great place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Two days ago we needed some fast food before jumping on the plane to Calgary, the plane was leaving in 15 minutes so I gave my son my credit card to order us two plates of pad Thai noodles because we were in a rush and starving hadn't eaten in six hours. And who wants to eat airplane food. Usually when you order noodles from Thai express their food is already cooked and they to scoop it out for you and that way it's quick. However here, they charge my sons credit card handed it back to him and then said come back in 20 minutes. How many people wait 20 minutes for fast food Thai noodles? Especially at an airport where people are about to jump on a plane. I had to wait by our luggage to make sure all our stuff wasn't stolen so that's why I had given my 14-year-old my credit card. So after this snafu I needed to leave my luggage, go back to the Thai place, ask for a refund, and they treat us like we are complete idiots and chastise my son and said she told him it would take 20 minutes. However she didn't tell him that until after he had paid. What a pain in the ass. Make your food faster!!!!!!"}
{"text":"New Thai place in Henderson! Super impressed and so excited to tell everyone about this new fast casual Thai restaurant! Everything is made to order right in front of you!

.::DIY GOES LIKE THIS
1. Pick ENTREE (Various Soups, Curries, Rice,Noodles,or Salads)
2. Pick PROTEIN (Shrimp,Beef,Chicken,Vegetable,Tofu,Fish)
3. Pick SPICE LEVEL (Mild, Medium, Spicy, Very Spicy)

--they price it by what protein you pick.. and if you want to make it a combo it's additional $ according to what side you want.(see menu pic here...::..https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thai-express-henderson?select=Yx1c5lNbkH_fo4NOn3F2NQ

Bet you guys know what I got... my go-to... Yellow Curry.. for protein, I chose Tofu of course!  Their curry ranks up there with my favorite Thai places... I LOVE how there is PINEAPPLE mixed in, the chunks of potatoes are soft, just a bit too much rice than curry for me though. I might see if they could put in on the side next time. (Curry w/Tofu protein 7.98)

Got Mango Salad for the side. Mango was in season sweet, tossed with cilantro made this refreshing. (+3.50 for salad and fountain soda)

Spice level: Mild \Medium\Spicy\Very Spicy ....if you know me you know my flavor profile is on the milder side...Im not fond of burn your tongue spicy....sooo mild spice was PERFECT...not much heat...

.::AMBIANCE
-Modern interior, natural (greens, brown) color scheme with pops of my favorite color pink! The dining area consists of a variety of tables,  banquette seating, communal hi-tops tables with stools.

Fast Casual style = no table service ..stand in line, order & pay first..food is a step-up from fast food.

..::LOCATION
-corner of Sunset/Stephanie Thai Express faces Stephanie St. in shopping plaza shared with Cafe Zupa.

.::MORE DEETS
-Thai Express is a franchise based in Canada, as Troi Y. put it, \"Thai's response to Panda Express\"..lol .. You'll notice the pretty takeout containers are in French language. The manager, Pho, who lives here, says Henderson is the first in the Vegas valley to open this popular restaurant.

-Brand new just opened first day of 2018!! The Thai Express team is pretty green too (so give them a little slack), but eager and excited as all the customers that kept coming into

I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the quality, authenticity and overall beautiful presentation of Thai Express. I'm very likely to come back REAL SOON!

#500 Yelp review
#001 for 2018"}
{"text":"I'm usually fair when it comes to reviewing spots but in this case I just can't be. The older asian guy that was cooking the food was constantly coughing into the food!

Will never ever return and gonna report him to the head office. Sadly I can't leave 0 stars. Disgusting don't come here!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: they now have a rewards program and I am so extremely excited!!

Thai Express is quick and easy! Their menu is very simple and pricing only varies based on the type of meat you put in your food. Serving sizes are decent but I've definitely been to places where they are larger. The place is always clean and the staff are always friendly. If you are a first timer don't be alarmed if the door looks dark, you may be entering through their back door. 

A few suggestions I would have for them,
1. Start a rewards program. Many people live for those and it's a good way to keep your customers coming and keep them happy too. (they have one now!!!!)
2. When buying the spring rolls separate maybe have two spring rolls for that price. I found it way too over priced for one roll. 

On a positive note, I've been here about 4 times now and the food has always been good. I was absolutely thrilled that they opened this location since it is so close to where I live! If you love Thai food and live in Henderson go and check them out!"}
{"text":"Sup homies and Asians (you Asian and you readin this and you know it) 

Well lemme hold it down for ya and go easy on me cuzz. And shout out P.I.M.P squad. Momma I luhhh u. 

Normally a brotha like me don't goto these kinds of places but homeboy called us out and we respectfully accepted. Now listen when a group of your Asian friends brings you some place suspect they know and all of them order something you've never heard of before..  Trust them more than your choice 

I was the odd one out that didn't get the pad Thai. I decided to go with the Curry rice with chicken.. 

Here's where da horror begun bruh. I open up this little box that cost 10 bucks and was like lol wut.. The pad Thai filled up the box to the top but with my Curry rice the chicken took up half the box and half with rice. 

Soo I unno bout y'all but I know what Curry is and all but I seen some liquidy ass milky rice that tasted sweet..  I ain't even know what I ate. On a suss note the chicken was good lol. 

Now I gave this an extra star because we came during closing and he offered me free rice which I gladly accepted because I wasn't close to full. So daps to the homeboy there. 

Now next time ima go wit the Asians brothas and roll with pad Thai but if you brown and you think this is some Indian typa Curry rice..  Bruhhhh; you ain't know the feel. This ain't a feel you wanna feel."}
{"text":"C'est de la nourriture \"thai\" américanisé disons. Le riz frit végé (ce que je prends toujours) est super bon, mais ils ne le cuisinent pas de la même façon à chaque fois. Les cuisiniers plus expérimentés connaissent mieux les quantités à respecter et le temps de préparation, les plus nouveaux ou ceux qui sont plus stressés, vont faire un riz souvent trop huileux, ou avec pas assez de sauce ou se tromper dans ta commande. Genre te donner un basilic au lieu d'un thai. Le service est souvent mauvais car à la caisse ils parlent rarement français. Pour la rapidité, c'est super, ils servent les gens très rapidement !"}
{"text":"Farce. Ordered tofu pad Thai which was then given to another customer. When I told them they'd done so, they made another one in less than a minute. The noddles were undercooked and there was chicken in it. I told the girl who blankly stared at me and attempted to tell me it was egg. I don't know which came first but I know the difference between a chicken and an egg"}
{"text":"This Thai Express just opened a few months ago so I figured I would try it out. 

First impressions were positive with a clean and current atmosphere. Very nice place I would have to say.

Food was fast and tasted awesome...with cute little take out boxes. Keeps the food nice and hot till we got home. 

My one head scratcher was that they had a Consumers Choice award for 2016 on their door... Makes you wonder how they won an award for 2016 when they just opened. I guess you just buy those awards to make ppl think your awesome.  The good thing is that they backed it up with my first experience so hopefully they keep up the good work"}
{"text":"The customer service is very bad! We bought food and sat down to eat, I realized we didn't get water. I sent my 16 yr old to get cups of water. The person gave my daughter a hard time questioning her if she bought food from there, what was her order and acted like she didn't believe her. Gave her the water with an attitude. When asked her name she gave a fake name \"Jane\". 
The rudest people I encountered ever!! I will never give business to this place again! 

Management- you should send your employees to learn what customer service is."}
{"text":"Typical for food court food. Service is really lacking at this location. Ordered soup which was piping hot however the taste was just meh. I have had better at other locations.

The lady at the counter looked like she would rather be any where but there. When I ordered my soup and drink, she couldn't get rid of me fast enough. Not sure why since I was the only person in line?

If I ever return to this mall, I will skip the Thai food and go for something more fresh and yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for food court Thai food. Quick ordering and lots of selection. I like that it's made \"some what\" fresh and in front of you. Everything was good but my entree could of used less sauce since it was a bit much and over powering. Besides that, it's your basic food court Thai food and is pretty good."}
{"text":"Fast food thaïlandais comme on aimerait en voir en France.
Service rapide, plats proposés très copieux et pas mal.
J'ai prix un pad Thaï aux crevettes qui m'a couté 9$ et c'est facilement mangeable par deux  personnes.
On peut prendre à emporter dans des sortes de petits cartons à la chinoise comme on en voit chez les traiteurs chinois."}
{"text":"Thai Basil (spicy) with Fish. Luv it! Wish there were more of these locations. A bit inconvenient finding parking at Chandler Mall Fri - Mon, but worth the search. Need more stand alone locations."}
{"text":"Very poor food quality.
The chef often seems like he doesn't care and is going through the motions.
Sometimes undercooked veggies and I have had a diagreeable stomach after eating here.
Too bad because I like the chain, but this location needs improvement."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place at all! Food is was a nightmare! My husband ordered chicken noodle soup, it's more like a pickled noodles! They put tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, and shrimp! Taste like vomit!!! And the chicken wings is more of a \"pepper\" chicken wings! No flavour what so ever! And the fried rice was just fried with tons of soy sauce! Spring rolls were just the wrapper! No meat! So disappointed for $35 meal!!! Will never ever go back here!"}
{"text":"A great and modern space in this strip mall. I like it!   When I arrived it wasnt busy and it was right before lunch. I noticed as soon as I walked in that everything was clean and the atmosphere was not your average fast food kind of place. Maybe because the building is fairly new and all the furnishings too?

Same concept as all fast food places, order at the counter, pay, watch your item being made and take it to go or to a table.Quick and easy.

We ordered the pad sew entree, fried rice and some veggie rolls. All were very good.  The portions are pretty hardy for the entrees. All reasonably priced items for lunch and freshly made.

A great place to come for lunch or dinner. As well as a great place to order and take to go. Will be back."}
{"text":"Super cute spot! Very clean and colorful inside. The staff was very friendly. Although service was a little slow, I'm sure its due to them just opening and still getting into the swing of things. Pad thai and pad see ew were very good. The steamed chicken dumplings were my favorite, I would pass on them next time! Can't wait to explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Pad Thai is my favorite and is the only Pad Thai I like (and have tried a lot now). I also find the STC branch to be my favorite branch :) I can't really speak for the other items on their menu but the Chicken Pad Thai is the best!"}
{"text":"This review is for this Thai Express at Yorkdale specifically. 

It's the WORST Thai Express ever! Thai Express has my favourite pad thai, and it's usually pretty consistent across the locations (considering it's a chain). But this location left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. 

First of all the customer service was horrible. The man that cooked my meal did not crack a smile and after I said thank you he responded with a mean stink eye. Second of all the food was really really bad. Noodles were overcooked and it was as if he forgot to put in the pad thai sauce as my pad thai looked overall watery and didn't have the normal colour to it. Obviously he didn't want to be there. 

I was really disappointed because I've had Thai Express a lot and it's never this bad. If you're at Yorkdale, pick something else! Anything is better!!"}
{"text":"-Ordered 2 chicken padthai, stingy portion sizes
-was charged for 4 padthais; instead of offering to correct the error, staff suggested we return on another day despite there being no other customers in the store. 
-staff said he wasn't aware of how to process a refund, so we asked for cash refund instead, we were told there was not enough cash in the til for a $20 refund; we ended up leaving with $20 cash refund."}
{"text":"they did not take my visa which is a culture shock for me. most businesses in the u.s. do if they take credit card. food's pretty good but i feel like i paid $7 for more rice than red tofu curry. if my bike were here i wouldn't care but a little annoyed especially since i just discovered it's a franchise. still the service was fast and the cashier made sure i was ok."}
{"text":"Usually pretty quick with your order but lines can get crazy at lunch and after work from the work towers above. The food is usually very oily, very heavy and once a while the bean sprouts don't taste so fresh and crispy. The flavours are there but it's a little under what I would expect from a good food court spot. There is not much seating inside but a beautiful open patio and food court seating indoors just down the hall. Not a bad place to grab thai if you're craving it."}
{"text":"Great place to come and eat with your family our by yourself.  Wonderful staff, great customer service and delicious food . Must try there thai tea, stir fry with peanut..tom yum with coconut milk. I believe they have a 10%locals discount, might have to mention it, but why not.."}
{"text":"Really nice place! Food was really good, I got the stir fry with chicken and it was super good. It was a lot of food too I could barely finish it. The staff was also amazing and really attentive. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"They just opened.Ate there today very yummy,me and my kids loved it.My son is very picky and he had the chicken pad thai so that's a good thing  we had the chicken wings,general thai chicken and pineapple fried rice.All delicious.Cool soda machine,the setup is modern and nice.Keep making yummy food"}
{"text":"The good - the food does taste fresh and delicious. 

The bad - Despite the name - Thai express - this place is very slow. If you're in a rush for a super quick meal, this place is not for you.  Ordered lunch here several time and every single time it took me about 20 minutes to get my food. Very slow service."}
{"text":"I wish I had looked this place up before going there to eat. Absolutely horrible food. The soup was just hot water with noodle in it. It had no flavor or salt. Complete waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Watch out, and maybe avoid. The cashier lady *will* yell or raise her voice at you if you so much as make a misstep ordering. By that I mean that you need to know you want \"Stir Fry, w/x-flavoring\", speak really clearly or else she'll snap at you. I almost walked out.

(Doesn't matter if you're speaking French or English, this will happen. Wonder what Concordia students think...)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Pad Thai! Big plate and I enjoyed it!

The staff were friendly and prepared my food quickly!

There was a guy/customer who was yelling at the employees. When I asked them what happened, they told me that he came back with his plate saying that he didn't enjoy his meal, so they made him a different meal but he returned again so they made him a 3rd meal (all without charging him extra) so then they refused to make him another one. (I completely agreed with them and told them that!)

I enjoyed my meal and despite this annoying \"customer\", it was good experience."}
{"text":"Wow, definitely the worst \"Thai\" food I've ever tried to choke down. Completely flavorless, mushy and definitely not worth the $8.95.  You'd be better off gnawing on your sweaty sock...."}
{"text":"I get that it's fast food and all, but the curry I ordered was lacking any kind of flavour. You can't call something like that a curry and charge about $10..."}
{"text":"Walked by around 530 pm and decided on a whim to do pick up of pad thai (one of my all time life favourite dishes).  I got a veggie pad thai.  While they were cooking it, I made myself a little take out container (really little...sample size) of peanuts, hot sauce, and hoison sauce.  I like their take out area with self-serve chopsticks, spoons, etc.

Dish temperature was really good, and the container it came in was soooo cute.  Like a stereotypical \"classic\" Chinese food take out box.  The sheer amount of noodles they rammed in there was impressive, but I still don't know if it was worth over $9.  It was...meh.  I wanted it to be...fishier?  It was missing SOMETHING.  I also didn't like the tofu consistency.  Can't say I'll never be back, because it was convenient."}
{"text":"Food was ok. But here's an easy fix....dont make me struggle with the flimsiest cheapest forks. Already you use cheapest plates which look cheap but if I have to struggle with fork that bends when I pick up rice there's a problem.  Small portions and not cheap."}
{"text":"So my girl and I stopped by Thai Express on a Sunday. As we were the only ones there I suppose it had just opened for the day. The gentlemen who took our order did everything you would want someone to do. He welcomed us, made eye contact and smiled, we were in for a treat. Our order was an egg roll, a spring roll and two entrees. Here's where it all went wrong. We take our seats which were 4 tables away from the counter. The first item ready was one of the entrees, a lady puts it up on the counter and calls to us. Between us and the counter are two employees. One was a tall silver haired bespectacled guy and and the other an asian guy. They are literally 3 feet from the counter. The asian guy looked at the food, glances at my girl, and then turns back to the food. If he thought about bringing it to us he dismissed it immediately . I am guessing he is a chef as he had that holier than thou air about him. As my girl approached the counter to pick up one entree she had to walk between the two Thai Express employees. My girl returns and a few minutes later the second entree was put on the counter and I went to fetch it and again, had to walk between the two guys wearing Thai Express shirts. I get back to the table, minutes later the spring roll comes up, I go get it and for the egg roll the guy who took our order brought it to us. I will not applaud the system for how the food comes out as it is all over the place. I will just say it is not how I dine. I have nothing bad to say about the food but it was not amazing nor was the visit. How do I put this, what were you thinking? Taking care of the guest is everyone's job, you actually stood there and refused even the simplist of tasks. In closing, there are many Thai choices in Henderson,I will not make mine Thai Express, good day."}
{"text":"i dont usually write reviews but this was one of the worst experiences Ive had with thai food . ever.
the picture on the wall looked fairly good - pad see ew (the call it pad sew) with noodles, chinese broccoli tofu and egg. What we received was essentially a bowl of noodles swimming in soy sauce. it was virtually inedible. After picking out the 5 or 6 pieces of broccoli and 5 pieces of tofu, i had to dump the remaining bowl of oversalted noodles and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best meal
Iv had in a long time!!!! It was my first time to this new food court and to thai express. I went around 12.  Ppl helped me choose a yummy meal and made it spicier for me.  They prep the food on the spot, it's not sitting in one of those buffet hot pots. I had the green coconut curry. I finished my plate !!! Can't wait to have it again!!"}
{"text":"I eat at Thai express often but this location is by far the worst, both in terms of food and service. Should have yelped before ordering.... 
Rice was dry and stale, stir fry also dry lacking sauce. I had to add soya sauce just to get it down. Try something else in the area...."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was standard. Not really spicy. I had a 4 out of 5 in regards to the spice. The portion of the Yellow Curry Chicken dish was small. The taste was good but they should add more curry sauce as the plate was dry. They had a good vegetable soup. They did have a bad smell almost like wet dog. Maybe because they had the front door and back for wide open. Overall I think the place needs time before it's a 5 Star experience. The staff was very friendly and provide 10 Star hospitality!"}
{"text":"3 times I've ordered from this location because it's close to work. 3 times they've managed to screw up the order. Since when does General Thai Beef consist of chicken? Seriously; it's not that hard. I even asked the guy behind the counter which one was the General Thai Beef to make sure it was right. Got it home; wife opens it up... chicken.

I'll stick to the location closer to home, this one is a dud."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the Villa Madina half of this restaurant.  Shame on Yelp for not distinguishing the two for the search process.  Because of this, it looks like I'm giving Thai Express a bad review. 

Half an hour before class (again) and I needed something to feed my belly close to campus.  Last time, I went into this restaurant and walked right back out because I realized I had eaten Thai Express for the last 3 weeks and could not get enough of it, but didn't really pay much attention to Madina. 

So this time I thought I'd give them a whirl.  Since I like Mediterranean food, it took me a while to decide what plate to try out.  I went for the oddest one I could see, which was the Sujuk plate.  Sounds weird right?

It's basically a mix of your choice of rice, salad, potato wedges and some all-beef sausages with some garlic and hummus.  Mmmm this makes me hungry just typing it.  

Anyway the lady behind the counter seems to be in a rush and I caught a hint of a mild language barrier between us, but what can I say, it's Toronto.  I chose the vegetable rice and the coleslaw salad.  She dishes up said items along with the potato wedges and dips and sits the plate on her side of the counter while the sausages heat up.  My plate gets to me after about a 10 minute wait, which I find rather long.  

I grab my plastic utensils and head upstairs where I can get a more private seat for my meal.  I chose a seat where I can overlook the Evergreen Mission and the people outside who have clearly seen better days. They are constantly looking around suspiciously with their hands rummaging in their pockets.  Quite an interesting vantage spot, because when I look straight forward and see a sign for a Full Body Massage.  I casually gaze into the window and someone catches my eye and abruptly draws the curtain.  Heheh. Maybe I should check that place someday when I have a kink in my uh...neck.

Back to the food.  I bite into one of the sausages and am pleasantly surprised as to the unique flavour of the spice and a tough texture that is clearly from overcooking.  This tastes awesome nonetheless!  I dip it in the hummus and have another bite....it's so good.  Thinking I'm going to enjoy the rest of the plate, I wield my fork in the direction of the potato wedges and notice that they are all shriveled up and tired looking...not a good sign.  I stick the fork in one and realize it's very hard to do so.  Inside my mouth, the potato wedge is cold, undercooked, and not even close to crispy.  Inside my mind there are visions of Gordon Ramsay reaming out one of his stooge-like pupils, slamming dishes on the floor and calling them a donkey.  I'm really that disappointed.  How do you screw up potato wedges?

On to the rice.  I figure that potato wedges are hard to mess up, but rice should be next to impossible.  Wrong!  The rice is underdone and hard.  The grains cling to each other and taste more bland than sock lint.  On top of everything else, I decide that this is instant rice.  This causes me to cuss out loud.  I really have half a mind to take this rancid plate back and demand a fresh one.  If I had the time, I may have. 

The coleslaw was thankfully edible and good as far as coleslaw goes.  I soldiered on because I was damn hungry, and damn sure I wasn't letting my $8.00+ go to waste. Fully aware that I was likely to regret my decision later that day, I cleaned it all up anyway except for the most shrunken and despicable potato wedges left on the plate.  

Overall, not impressed with the meal.  Especially for the premium I was charged for it.  I'm happy to report that despite the sloppy cooking job that a 12 year old could have pulled of successfully, I was not food poisoned.  Having spent over $8 on a plate of food I would at least expect to be full, but I was still craving a Big Mac after that.  The only thing saving this joint from a 0/5 is the sausages.  Admittedly they were good, but they won't bring me back to this place.  If I do come back, it will be for the Thai Express half."}
{"text":"Its a convenient spot, being very close to St Clair Station. Its also attached to a cafe in case you want a coffee with your curry. I had a Thai soup with veggies , beef and some lemon grass. I ended up adding a lot of hoi sin sauce and hot sauce because the broth was not that strong. 

This place is decent in a pinch but there is a family owned Thai place near the St Clair Sobeys that is much better."}
{"text":"Great service and food quality! I'm officially a lifer for Chandler's Thai Express. What made my fried rice meal? Fresh amazing basil! Yummmmm! And I was served enough food to have seconds for dinner."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Northern Virginia to the Toronto area.  This was my third meal of my trip.  On my first day, a coworker of mine took me to the food court, and we passed Thai Express, which had a line around the block.  I figured that such a long line would indicate good food.  To give some reference, I was looking for vegetarian food, and I don't like Chinese style food.  

The line was so long that an employee was walking through the line, asking each of us for our orders so that he could put it on a piece of paper to hand to the counter that would prepare the order.  I asked him what he would recommend, since I wanted vegetarian.  Somehow we chose the yellow curry.  He told me that Red curry was spicy, Yellow was medium, and Green was mild.  I'm a south indian that has grown up in the U.S., so I can handle some spice, but I don't want my mouth on fire.  I figured that they could substitute tofu instead of meat.  This in my opinion should have been cheaper than meat.  Instead it appeared to be more difficult for them, and they charged me extra for the tofu.  

I also ordered some water.  This seemed to be a simple order.  Instead it required two employees how to figure out how to ring up my order, somehow I was charged 1.99 for the flavored water, although I just wanted plain water.  We waited a few minutes for the food, and then I wasn't even 100% sure it was my order, but he seemed to confirm that it was my order. 

I tried the food in the seating area, which was surrounded by a line around the corner.  This food was mediocre at best, which was disappointing consider this lunch was over $11.  Additionally, the tofu seemed to just be thrown on the side, I would hope they would have cooked it into the meal.  Overall, I couldn't understand why there was such a long line.  Toronto has been surprising me all week."}
{"text":"Look - it's Yonge and Gerrard. This place is dirty. You'll want to not eat your food here. But I've got a soft spot for veggie pad Thai from Thai express.  I know it's not Thai food. And I like real Thai food too. But I mean sometimes junk food versions of excellent food can be yummy ... I enjoy that it's a mess of random flavours. I like dipping it in a ton of their fish sauce . For me, don't think of this as Thai food or a clean restaurant, and you might have a good experience"}
{"text":"Quick service counter, with a clean and spacious dining room, offering a variety of popular Thai dishes you can customize with your choice of protein and spice level. Appreciate that they have \"healthy\" soup and salad options rather than just a bunch of high-carb noodle dishes.

Tom Yum soup with coconut milk and shrimp was decent- huge portion if you dine in, not so much if you opt for takeout. Broth wasn't as complex as I'd expect. The pad salad with vermicelli and chicken was okay- noodles were overcooked, had to add sriracha to perk up the sauce, but there were plenty of veggies. 

Attention to detail is a bit lacking: appetizer dumpling order was clearly overcooked and falling apart. I was the only customer, not sure why these weren't remade because they weren't up to a minimum standard. I make them better myself at home from Trader Joes. 

Pricing is generally good for entrees- under $10, large portions. Add ons add up though, and apps are overpriced, like $1.88 for a pinkie-sized egg roll and nearly $4 for a single spring roll. Order wisely."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken Pad Thai! I got medium spicy and it is the perfect amount of spice for me. My boyfriend got the very spicy Thai soup and it has a real kick! The vegan and gluten free options are a great bonus! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The fact that this franchise keeps popping up all over the place is a testament to the fact that people have no freaking clue.

How desperate are you for Thai food that you have to suffer through the  globulous mess that is their Pad Thai? What is that brown sauce they put on it? It tastes like warm, brown dessert syrup.

The curries are not much better.

The Tom Yum Soup is marginally do-able if you put enough lime and chili oil in it, but it's not winning any awards.

Just say 'NO'."}
{"text":"I really hope this place stays! It's very very very good! I got the Mild Chicken Pad Thai it is Amazing! I also got the Tom Yum Soup it is phenomenal! You've gotta try this place! Bring the all your friend (people usually have one lol) and the whole fambam!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot to grab a quick bite to eat. I ordered their Thai chicken and it was pretty good! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of their stuff"}
{"text":"I love Thai Express it's a great chain of restaurant! I love the fact that unlike many of its competitors everything is made fresh to serve. Clear windows allows you to see what the chefs are cooking and how they are cooking it. 

They have both rice/noodle dishes and soup noodle dishes which opens up a variety of menu items that you can choose from. You can also choose the amount of spice you'd like in your food as well which is a plus.

I usually always get the General Thai which consists of battered pork, green peppers, red peppers, onions, tomatoes and pineapples (I usually ask without) and get the medium spice as the next level up I find too bolstering for my taste buds.

COME EARLY.

I feel bad for people who have lunch right at 12:00PM because the line up is crazy there. I was there quarter to noon and the line up was already crazy and I was joyfully munching down my food I couldn't help but feel bad for the people waiting in line.

This place never lets me down and I doubt it will let you down too. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food to eat! Our new favorite place! We will be a frequent customer indeed! The owner Pho was there to greet customers and it's so wonderful to see the care and detail into making our food. 

I ordered the shrimp  & chicken  fried rice  with pineapple  and my husband ordered the mild shrimp  curry  YUM YUM YUM ! 
I also ordered the vegetable egg rolls! Terrific!

We have to eat gluten free and was happy to know that we could get gluten free from their menu as it's super easy to read and again tastes AMAZING . 
Beautiful location and atmosphere and you can tell they put some serious thought into building this location . 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food, don't expect gourmet. As long as the food is fast, tastes okay and there's no bugs in it, AND service don't piss me off, I think it's pretty good. 

I only go to Thai express for their beef pad sew. Just for a quick bite, the service is pretty fast. They make it right there for you, you can watch and it comes piping hot. I like to eat it here because I don't like the take out containers cause it's hard to eat from them and the noodles get soggy and the container soaks up all the sauce. I really like the pad sew noodles here, it has a chewy texture that I can't get enough of. It's also loaded with soya sauce... Hmmm sodium chloride! The beef is okay and I like how they throw in some veggies in the dish! 

I always come here for a quick sodium-carbattack!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how chain restaurants can screw up so badly at providing services. 

The counter staff that work here are rude, even by Quebec standards. Not just rude, but kinda clued out and Spacey in a way only millennial work staff can pull off. Certainly no shortage of showing me how the tip thing works on the interac machine, then all of a sudden she had Oscar Wilde like vocabulary and diction, with expert powers of instruction and direction. 

The service at this place out weighs any food quantity or quality problems or compliments I might have had.  The order was however taken improperly and executed improperly. 

I have a difficult time understanding why franchise owners don't try harder. I can just drive down the street and get the exact same thing from another location. It's what I suggest for this review"}
{"text":"First, I adore the vibe inside! The space is so modern and fun with its green, pink, and black color scheme. Be sure to take a minute to check out the mural inside as well. Together, it definitely offers an inviting dine in feeling versus the temptation to order take out. Second, each time I've dined in, the staff have been friendly, willing to explain the menu, and the dining area has been very clean. Today, it was neat to have dropped by during the grand opening celebration! I was given a Thai Express swag bag, observed the ribbon cutting, and got to try a free sample of the mango salad. It was so tasty, guys! I love it when businesses offer samples; it allows you to try things you may not have ordered/ get out of an ordering routine. I know I'll be ordering the mango salad now in the near future! Last but not least , I suggest trying their imperial rolls. Pure deliciousness! They are not oily or too salty, which I appreciate. I did notice, though, that the sauce served with the imperial roll was different across two of my visits (see pictures). Regardless, both of the sauces along side the rolls were great. Overall, I'd say if you're in the North Scottsdale area, give this new place a try!"}
{"text":"For something quick, easy, healthy and on the go, also inexpensive! In the mall food court, so easy quick and easy. Quicker than anything else I've had at the food court and made right there in front of me. Ordered the green tofu curry. Very tasty and flavorful, had a good green curry flavor with a bit of a kick. 

Ordered the mango juice, we don't have these in the States and it's my new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is a quick thai take out.  They have about 10 different options, and each option has a sub-option of meat/sauce.  For example, they have Pad Sew, Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Stir Fry, General's chicken, etc.  You can compliment your meal with a spring roll, and a soda.  

Average price out the door with meal, drink and spring roll is approximately $11, and a good value for food quantity.

The problem is that this establishment is only open for lunch, and is in a food court.  You have 2 option for eating: take out or eat in the food court.  If you eat in, don't expect free refills on your soda (this applies to every restaurant in the food court)."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hampton Inn and did not want to drive. Walked over to Thai Express and it was really happening!  We ordered General Thai and the spicy General Curry. Both were great. Plenty of chicken.  I also had the shrimp roll from the fridge. Yummy and crunchy. Eat there often as it is good, clean, healthy and we want them to stay in business."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times at different locations and had different experiences. When I tried this place the first time I thought it was not too bad until I tried their food at other locations.
I personally find their curry way too thin and not creamy at all = like water. 

Luckily I found a much better Thai place so I won't go back to Thai Express."}
{"text":"I had a great first impression as I walked in, as this has to be one of the most nicely decorated fast food places I've been to. It could easily pass for a mid-range restaurant in that respect. I ordered the shrimp green curry over white rice to go. When I returned to my office, it was clear that though the decor was punching above its weight, the food was not.

The curry had a decent taste, but was too watery and off with its texture. There was virtually no variety with the veggies, so it was effectively: shrimp, basil and too much (soggy) eggplant. The simplicity was somewhat of a saving grace too however, since the shrimp, rice and taste of the curry were still passable.

Fairly mediocre overall, and the $13 bill (no drink or sides) weighs a bit on the review as well."}
{"text":"The women who work here are very nice and helpful. I ordered a veggie spring roll with pad Thai. The spring roll was good and the peanut dipping sauce was great. The pad Thai sauce and noodles were tasty. The fried tofu was crispy. I'm not a fan of a ton a veggies in pad Thai- I could have done without the broccoli, baby corn, and peppers. I ordered medium spice--it was completely mild. My real objection is the mild case of food poisoning I got later that day. It's impossible to say for sure what did it, but I have a one strike rule with these things."}
{"text":"Food tasted good enough. But the after effect is not worth it. Haven't had heart burn this bad in a while. Also, the Thai iced tea sucked."}
{"text":"For fast food, I find Thai Express usually hits the spot. The server who took my order seemed relatively disinterested but the man who gave me my food was much more invested and friendlier. When on the move and you don't have time for \"proper\" Thai, this will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"The place is really nice, love the decor...  but can't say the same for the food.  Menu is very limited, food is bland and I wanted really spicy, but got very little spicy.  Won't return.  I was really hoping I'd love it since it's on my way home from work.  Bummed."}
{"text":"I decided to try it.  Just because the lines at this place are INCREDIBLY wrong so it makes me think they must be doing SOMETHING right.  I hate foodcourt food, I truly do.  But in a bit of a food (that is fast) desert (not a fast-food desert- because there is lots of that)- I needed something quick and the line had yet to form.

I got the pad thai because that's just what you do when you come to a standard place like thai express.

The food was so bleh, the veggies didn't look fresh- especially since they just fry them up, and i'm fairly sure a lunch to-go- portion comes up to my daily caloric intake- which isn't necessarily a terrible thing if the TASTE was commensurate with how BAD it is for you.  it wasn't.

Don't let the long lines trick you- they are NOT good.  It merely has a long line because desk-job office workers who didn't bring their lunch also happen to be people with no taste buds."}
{"text":"My friend ordered a spicy tofu pad thai and it ended up being way to spicy like burn your lips off spice. The tofu is also different at this location which begs the question are they even using the supplier that is required of them? The workers are a little intimidating here, they could use some customer service training. Restaurant was also dirty. My friend instantly regretted not getting hotstar instead."}
{"text":"my first 1 star rating. 

I love thai food. I love when the take out is packed in cute chinese take out boxes. I love when the food is made fast so I can save time.

so I run in here to get some quick lunch before my class.

they had two veg options for almost everything: 1.Vegetables 2. Tofu
So I choose stir fry. that's the dialog that happens:
me: I'll have vegetarian stir fry with tofu
girl at the counter: vegetable stir fry (and starts typing it in and shouts the order in I suppose mandarin to the cook)
me: it's the tofu version right?
girl at the counter: tofu?
me: yes. it has tofu right?
girl at the counter: yes yes it has tofu (no smiles offered at any time)

I wait for 2min and get my order and run to the streetcar stop. I get onto the streetcar and start eating.

for $8 I got mini mini portion of food. but it gets worse.
40% of my meal was onion. 55% - rice and the rest 5% mix of 2 slices of broccoli and 4 slices of carrot.... where was the tofu I don't know but I guess it stayed at the kitchen.

result: I was hungry in an hour. and unsatisfied with my food and money spent.

am I coming back again? no. not to this location neither to any other of thai express. thank you."}
{"text":"Pretty meh overall if you ask me. I got the chicken Pad Sew, which came with a ton of noodles (no complaints there), minimal egg, and minimal broccoli. I would approximate the ratio as 75% noodle, 18% chicken, and 3.5% each for egg and broccoli, which for me, is way too skewed. I know that Asian food is pretty greasy (I'm Asian myself), nor do I usually care, but the entree was sitting in a puddle of sauce. If I had only paid $5 for it, that would have been par for the course, but I paid over $9 for it, which is ridiculous, if not expected considering the mall that it's in. I don't normally write reviews for places in food courts because I don't expect much, but this was pretty well below par for the course. It's got 3 stars because honestly it's pretty hard to butcher a simple noodle dish like this to the point of being inedible, but it can't be taken for granted what is needed to make a good dish either."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed. I got the Chicken Pad See Eew, which is very hard to mess up. That being said, they messed it up. The first mistake was giving me only five pieces of 1-inch chicken. Chicken is not expensive, and that made the typical overpriced airport food seem even worse. The second mistake was a weak sauce - it needed more oyster and dark soy sauce, and generally speaking, the sauce was more prominent for its oiliness than for any taste. The Chinese broccoli (gai lan) was fine, but that's also because you can't really preserve / freeze it like you could with something like carrots or peas, and it's pretty hard to overcook it as long as you pay attention. Spice level was fine, but I would have gone a step up from the medium (level 2 of 4) as well. Lastly, the stuff at the bottom kind of sat in the pooling sauce and acquired not only a soggy texture that needed to be spooned up but also a peculiar infusion taste.  With tax, it was over $10. I could have made this dish three times over for that amount of money at home (and have). 

Kinda confusing how to order. You can go up to the register on the right hand side, which is often blocked from view by people waiting for their orders, or go to either of the registers farther back that service all three of the places in that alcove. Service is not bad. It just gets rather congested with everyone waiting around in that space for their orders."}
{"text":"With little choices in this building, this is one of the best places to get lunch. This opened  maybe in 2015, compared to most of the places around, this has one of the best Asian food to choose from.

 It is your standard thai express in a food court and it's quite quick when they cook your food. I usually order the basil fried rice with chicken or beef, the pad thai which contains peanuts and is quite spicy, or the general Tao chicken on steamed rice. You can choose the meat, seafood, or veggies that you put on, with beef and chicken being the most economical and popular. They pack up your food in a box for take out and you can grab your own utensils on the way out. Expect to pay around $10 for just the food, if you want a combo it goes up to around 12 to $13 which includes a spring roll and a drink from the fountain.

 What's good is that service is quick and food is mediocre. You can choose your level of spiciness between none, mild, medium, and spicy. I usually go for the medium and it adds a nice kick to my lunch.  Overall, 4 stars when you compare with its competition in the building (which ain't much, there after a few sandwich places, a freshii, booster juice, pizza joint, Starbucks, and a Timothy's coffee shop)."}
{"text":"pretty terrible
Pad thai is just noodles and some meat, and tiny flecks of green onion
Wrong kind of noodles, no peanuts, fish sauce, lime, peanuts, tamarind
sweet thai-ish sauce gives it a reddish colour
but you're better off getting a burger or shawarma here than Thai"}
{"text":"It really only deserves 2.5 stars, but something makes me go back.  It's... it's not that bad.  Look, it's not thai food, and I am the first to admit that.  But sometimes I am at St. Clair station with an empty stomach and 25 minutes to kill, and I'm not proud of this, but I will go to Thai Express to get their chicken pad thai (skip the floppy oily tofu).

Why?  Because it is a hot mess of saucy sweet noodles, and I cover it with lime and fish sauce and peanuts and I eat it.  Because there's always a table at the weird times I go.  Because the staff are nice.  Because, and this is the big reason, because they make it to order, so you don't get those dreadful tasteless pink \"pad thai\" noodles, but a huge hot saucy plate.  It ain't great, but some days it'll do."}
{"text":"The Thai Express at Eaton centre's foodcourt is overpriced. Why would you want to pay $8 for fast food that lacks authenticity and flavor. I ordered the red curry chicken and the food was watery and bland. It lacked any flavor whatsoever. I went back and informed the manager who said \"oh we can re-cook it for you.\" I wasn't sure what that meant but I understood that they would add some flavor to their food. All I got back was the same curry chicken only hotter (warmer). Big waste of $8."}
{"text":"Pad Thai soup very spicy was delicious! Food came out quick and was hot! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Combination platter was delicious. Miso soup also superb. Friendly efficient service. Would like to dine here often!"}
{"text":"For only ten dollars, I walked away with a ginormous bowl of soup. Is there anything better than cheap, hot food in a mall food court?

If you want quality Thai food, not sure why you are looking in a mall. If you just want a quick bite to eat while youre shopping, here's a good spot."}
{"text":"I had lunch at many different fastfood thai locations but this one is the worst for sure. Had a Pad Thai but it tasted just like nothing. Even the chicke had a strange taste - couldn't eat it at all."}
{"text":"After a very long and tiring trip on a Thursday evening, I wound up at the Islington station parking lot waiting to pick someone up and starving.  It was nearly 8:30, and even though I lived about 5 minutes away for four months last summer, I never ate in the area.  But I found the sign for Thai Express at the Sunlife Financial Centre - score!  I'd never eaten at one before, but I was so hungry that anything with the word \"Express\" in the title sounded like a good idea at that point.  

I was a little nervous walking into the building, due to the time and the fact that everyone else was headed towards the doors.  I found the food court, where some counters were already closed.  There were people in the back at Thai Express, but the ingredients seemed to be put away so I called back and asked if they were open.  The woman who came out to answer me had the biggest smile of any person who has ever served me fast food.  She assured me that they were open and ready to serve me, and with my order of Shrimp Pad Thai (medium spicy), she was off.  She chatted to me while she was preparing the meal, and was generally so happy that she made me happy - that's saying a lot after I'd been driving/taking transit for the past 4 hours (don't ask, long story).  

I think what made me happiest was the takeout container.  I've watched so many American movies and television shows where they order Chinese or Thai food and get these cute little cardboard boxes - but I've never been served one.  Of all the Asian take out I've ever eaten, this is the first time.  I was so happy that I'd ordered my meal to go.

As for the food itself?  Well c'mon, it's fast food Thai.  If you're looking for a really authentic experience (like I usually am), this is not the place to go.  For what it is, it was pretty darn good.

All in all, if you're hungry and really want something tasty and pretty cheap, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Review on the Run:

Not a lot of choices for fast food in the area which explains the long lineups here for lunch.  I find the food ok.  It's an alternative to burgers.

Conclusion: Eat Here?  Yes."}
{"text":"I got on yelp because the Thai here was not so good. It's unfortunately the worst Thai I've ever had. Sorry."}
{"text":"Meh. They have a daily $7 special that's fine for what you're paying. 
I love green curry chicken and theirs doesn't have enough of the good stuff: lemongrass, coconut milk and spice. It's edible but doesn't wow me - but that's to expect from a fast food chain."}
{"text":"resto faisant partie d'une chaîne
bonne bouffe, et bon choix de plats
pas le meilleur thai en ville mais ok
bien situé"}
{"text":"Meh!! Double Meh!! I hoped for better. The beef Pad See Ew was dry and all noodles. No Flavor. Tasted like out of a box. Not worth the price it was $8.88. You get better food at Panda and I don't like Panda."}
{"text":"This is my favourite fast food place, food it always soo good and fresh and it's ready pretty quick. You have to try it out!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the place was empty bc they have only been open for 2 weeks. Ordered pad see ew with tofu and one with beef. Food was ready in about 5 min. I would best describe it as a Thai fast food. definitely not the best Thai food I have had but for the price and the convenience it was good. A bit too much fish sauce and the tofu didn't have a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Worst so-called Thai food we have ever experienced. Sloppy, greasy wide noodles with some gunk on them and called Pad See Ew. Pad Thai was unpalatable and swimming in grease. Meh."}
{"text":"First off I have no idea how this place could ever get a bad review. This was my first time experiencing this place and it was amazing!! The lady at the register was patient kind and very helpful. She really cared that I was looking for a vegan option and broke everything down for me. I was excited because this is one of the only places in the mall that offers vegan options that are tasty. My food was amazing nice and hot. I ordered the medium heat and it was just the right amount of spicy!! I will be returning and sending other vegan and none vegan friends their way!!"}
{"text":"The basil fried rice was good. The shrimp spring roll was my favorite it was really fresh.  The noodles were good and I like that you can pick your spice level."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Thai Express with my sisters and dad, we all met up at the Berri Metro stop and ran across the street to eat.
 
  The inside is modern Green , and Grey colours throughout. 3 employees were there to help serve you and make sure the meals are quickly made to order and affordable prices.
 
   They offer soups with your choice of meats, egg/spring rolls, veggie options like fried Tofu and Curries. Red curry: Pepper, onion, bamboo shoots and Thai basil
                     Green curry: Pepper, onion, eggplant and Thai basil
                     Yellow curry: Pepper, onion, carrot, potato and pineapple
And Choice of: A) Shrimps B) Beef C) Chicken D) Vegetable E) Tofu F) Fish
 
   Amazing Made to order choices.

Stir-Frys, Fried Rice,  Pad Thai, Pad Sew, are more of the choices you can make to eat here.
    
   My sister got the Chicken Pad Thai .  Its Thin rice noodles stir-fried with sweet and sour sauce, eggs, bean sprouts, green onion, tofu and salted radish with thin sliced chicken, soo good.  My sister ordered it in a to-go box and ate with chop sticks, she ordered it medium (hot) and wow it was spicy!  She shared half the dinner with me, the order comes with plenty of food.

  My other sis ordered the Yellow Curry Dish with Shrimp. Its a silky, creamy and spicy dish made with coconut milk, served on steamed rice.  The rice was good I think basmati, and the curry was good. I did enjoy the Pad Thai more though.
  
 Great speedy fast, I can't believe how fast they cook food on the Burning Hot Wok.
They really know what they're doing here, and it seems convenient and a go-to food for lots of locals.  I see lots ordering take- out and back on the Metro, pretty convenient.

I'de come back to Thai Express they make your food made to order quickly..Pad Thai"}
{"text":"We went here to grab a quick bite to go. I read some reviews and figured why not. Wow people of yelp are nuts (or just being paid) because the food was horrible. The price point is like $1.00 cheaper than a normal Thai restaurant.  I really wonder if the people who tried this have had real Thai food, I get it that it's fast food and all. The pad see ew was bland and I don't know what was going on with the sweet and sour stir fry haha."}
{"text":"Its delicious, but the tofu was overcooked. If they wouldn't of overcooked the tofu it would of been perfect."}
{"text":"This place is super close to school so that's a plus :) They don't ask you how spicy you want your food, but the shrimp pad Thai is always yummy and I recently tried the Thai style shrimp fried rice which was also good. The chef guys who make your food know what they are doing but the ladies who take your order could definitely use some social skills... Overall the taste is good and you get a good amount of food on your plate for not that pricey and there's a wide variety of choices. The place is always clean and there's a lot of seating available, I also like being able to watch my food being made in front of me :)"}
{"text":"Headline: Made to order fast food Thai

Before I joined Yelp, I use to go to Thai Express all the time when I didn't cook.  How my taste buds have grown.  It sounded better than going to A&W or Manchu Wok right??? Right?

Likes: fast, large portions and quite tasty

Dislikes: lots of calories and sodium.  Also, while they constantly wash their woks, they use the same one for meat and vegetarian meals. So if you are one of those people are particular about this, then I suggest going somewhere else.

Verdict: does the job for fast food in Square One but not special by any means and many other options have opened up such as Shanghai 360, Su & Shi and Szechuan Express if you feel the need for Msg infused Asian food. More like 2.5 stars here."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating the opening of Thai Express for quite sometime now. Like many others, I was thrilled when I saw that there was going to be a Thai joint opening up on this side of town. I'm a huge fan of Thai food and I had high expectations for this place, however, I was a bit let down after my visit.

The menu is very simple. You start by choosing your dish- Soup, curry, fried rice, stir-fry, salad, Pad Thai, etc. Next, you choose your protein- Shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetable, tofu, fish, or battered chicken. The price of your dish is based on the protein you choose. You then choose the spiciness level of your dish. If desired, you can make your dish a combo with a side and fountain drink. 

I chose the General Curry as my dish, battered chicken in yellow curry, served on a massive bed of white rice. The curry was not as I expected. The base was thick and more like a paste or sauce instead of the traditional creamy broth-like base that I am used to. Potatoes were still undercooked and there were too many bell peppers for my liking. There were also pineapples in the mix, which was a first for me and interesting at that, but it's a sweet touch. Overall, the dish was just OK. I most likely wouldn't order it again. I enjoyed the Imperial Roll and the dipping sauce it came with.

I appreciate the fact that your food is made to order and the portions are quite large. I had a lot of leftovers to take home in the cutest to-go container. The interior of the restaurant is very clean and decorated nicely. I love the pink barstools and the tile floor in the very center of the dining area. Customer service was great. The employees were very friendly!

Given that Thai Express has only been open for about three weeks, I'm going to give it a while before I return to try other things on the menu. Hoping to add more stars to my updated review in the future after they work out the kinks and get settled!"}
{"text":"Yuck. 
The only thing good about my meal was the tap water in a big cup she gave me. 

Thought I would do the less fatty route during the shopping break at Sherway, but now, I highly recommend the rest of the food court than this (and New York Fries has Butter Chicken Poutine)

but I digress

This one is owned by some Mandarin/cantonese speaking people. But I wouldn't think this affected the food. I got a Pad Sew Vegetarian (description says large rice noodle, broccoli and something that's crossed out)
I also asked for this in medium spicy. 

What I got was this soy sauce (too much) covered noodles with little bits of broccoli, old cabbage and carrots, and some weird things that looked like tofu. And on a plate no less. (tip: do not say you will eat there. the box is much cooler \"to go\" and you don't see the awful presentation)

It tasted salty and nasty. I could have done better at home."}
{"text":"We have been many times here. The place is not busy most of the times as there are two other QSRs in the food court and one of them has been empty for a long time. 

The service is good and handles our special request of less oil while cooking and veggie sauces (no fish sauce)

Ordered a Tofu Basil Fried Rice, a Tofu Veggie Stir Fry with cashews and a Green Curry for a non vegetarian member. 

The Fried Rice well cooked and flavoured and the quantity just enough. There were two sizes of tofu in rice signalling one was older. The stir fry was perfect, but the rice less quantity and very minimal sauce (or the stir fry too dry) thus making the difficult to eat with rice. 

The green curry was OK but looked dry and the comment was similar- less green gravy"}
{"text":"I got a coupon by mail so I decided to check them out. I looked at the menu and there are plenty of vegan options available. I ordered the pad see ew with tofu. It was very delicious! I honestly wasn't expecting it to taste that good. I was expecting fast food quality. Food is served on proper plates. Quick and friendly service. Restaurant is spacious and clean. Overall I'm quite happy with my experience and I'm surely coming back to try out other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"This location opened last year and the food was really good. Lineups were huge and it was always really fresh. Lately (last few months) the place has definitely gone down hill. I typical get #8 with either chicken or beef and they noodles have been extremely dry and unappetizing. Wont be going there for lunch again."}
{"text":"With so few options in EMTC food court, this is one of the favourites when we are here.  The cashier changes now and then, but the \"chef\" is almost a constant at this location. 

One can now order to vegan a meal. Earlier, all you had to do was tell them to use a veggie sauce and not to add eggs. Glad Thai Express is acknowledging vegans. 

Ordered a Tofu Pad Thai with vegan options and with no or little oil. This no oil option cuts the fat content of your choice significantly and I believe does not compromise on the taste as much. 

The noodles cooked perfectly and the sauce plenty. The Tofu pieces are not consistent as with other locations, some offer pan fried, this location gives deep fried which I don't prefer, but it's OK. The taste was amazing, although I would prefer to be a bit less sweet and perhaps a little sodium in it. The noodles came piping hot which is perfect for me."}
{"text":"Hastily made fast food Thai food that is specifically made for mall food courts.  Not much to write here as the food lacks flavor traditionally found in genuine Thai food and the oil and grease in their food could block the mighty Mississippi.  Prices tend to be a bit high, especially for the three item offer."}
{"text":"The name says it all... This place is easy and fast. My favorite part of my experience was the 'easy.' Some places have so many rules you cannot keep up, but at Thai Express you just tell them what you want, and not a biggie. They build it all pretty much in front of you on a jiffy. If you're wondering if it is tasty, the answer is yes. It is also hearty. I ordered the Thai soup and it was great size. The peanut sauce was my favorite... You can actually feel the peanut chunks, so for that reason the dumplings and egg rolls are a must. During my visit, the attendants were on point... No complaints. This is off course not traditional Thai, so if you're looking for the hardcore traditional Thai flavors then this is not the place. It's not fair to come to a place that has the word 'Express' on the name and expect it to be full Thai, but it's rare to have any kind of Ethnic choices around in the neighborhood, so just for that alone they get the extra points."}
{"text":"Should've trusted the other reviews. This location is just ugh. The food is just off compared to other locations. 

Avoid unless desperate."}
{"text":"This place is clean delicious mango salad, great pad Thai , great Tom yum soup great customer service, friendly environment, family friendly"}
{"text":"Horrible

my girlfriend was at Scarborough Town Centre and asked if I wanted her to bring me something home to eat. 
I was craving pad thai and knew this place had recently opened, so I asked her to go.
The pad thai was nasty, the sauce used had no taste, (I actually needed to add ketchup just to taste anything) and there were so many bean sprouts in it (I guess they are cheaper than noodles?)

She got Ginger Beef, and it was just as bad, no flavor, we ended up throwing both away. 

I wont be back."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly but the food is not good. 
I tried a couple different items but quality is all the same. 
They use a great deal of oil to prepare the meals. So greasy that the other sauces run off the noodles. The amount of salt used in all meals is overwhelming. The soup just tastes like really salty water. No flavour. 
I understand it's fast food, but they are not even trying. 
I have been to other franchises of the same name with very different results."}
{"text":"It's your standard Thai express.  It's fast and quick and satisfies a \"junk food\" Thai craving if you have it. It's definitely not authentic but does the job for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Gross food and the tables were messy. I could elaborate, but I've already put more effort into writing this review then they do on food and presentation."}
{"text":"The cuisine is pretty simple and plain, despite of the fact that I added some extra vegetable and shrimps into my dinner and it looks abundant.
The food this restaurant serves is definitely everyone-can-make type.

Personally speaking, the price offered is a little high."}
{"text":"Usually love thai express. This place was kind of dirty. They were out of many key ingredients. Took a while to take our order, and then didn't quite get it right. The chicken was pretty fatty and low quality. The noodles were bland and under-seasoned. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Can't say much about this place. This place is one of the few choices available around my office without walking far. Food is just alright, can get a bit oily at times. I gave them a 3 cause they are just close to me."}
{"text":"This is the basil fried rice with shrimp. $12.00 . It had so salt (which is OK) & 6 pieces of shrimp. Rice was ok but a little greasy and dry. What I don't appreciate is the laziness of using frozen diced carrots. Really?"}
{"text":"For this review I am breaking two person cardinal rules: I'm reviewing what I believe is a chain, and Food Court Food (the latter I break a bit more than the former).

I can't go on and on about the service, or the ambiance. It's a mall, and a food court. The people who take your orders are ok I guess.

An famous American Author once said \"The simplest things are often the truest.\" This chain of Thai food restaurants really takes this statement to heart.

The time I went here they asked me how spicy I wanted it, hot, medium or mild. Which is pretty much good enough to get the point across. The food is cooked quickly and well. It doesn't have that odd ketchup taste that you get when you go to other fast food thai places, They have peanuts and you can take as much as you want, and you can take lemon wedges.

At this chain they understand the beauty of pad thai. They do it simple, fast and cheap. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, and it's not a high scale restaurant. However, the pad thai I have had here has always been very good. The elegance through simplicity is almost Tao like here.

Whenever I am in the Pickering Town Center, I like eating here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested this place saying it was quote ''really good.\" I wonder if she was trolling me because I wouldn't feed this to a dog if I had one. Have never tried Thai food and don't think I will ever again. Was expecting a big plate, instead she brought over a green coloured folded up box half the size of the Happy Meal boxes from McDonald's. Gee the Happy Meal would've given me more enjoyment. 

Noodles were gross, chicken was tasteless, little box of $9 steamed food that was worth throwing away. My girlfriend's older brother finished it though (don't ask me how) Myabe we should've ordered another box just for him."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place twice and I have to say that the food is good and the portion size is ok."}
{"text":"Honestly, I know this place is a franchise and all but it's probably one of the worse ones of its kind. It seems like the cooks don't want to be there and makes the food without any care. (C'mon we can watch you over the counter..put some effort into it). This one time, they forgot to season my chicken pad thai and it tasted very ugly."}
{"text":"Eaton Center - Urban Eatery - I ordered ginger chicken stir fry with steamed rice for lunch as a take out.  In retrospect, I don't think the stir fry option is the best choice for a take out because the rice is on the bottom of the take out container and gets soggy quickly sitting under the stir fry sauce.  The dish has good flavors with fresh vegetables and would be better eaten as a dine in option.  Along the same line, it doesn't make good leftovers either because of the soggy rice issue.

They also offer noodle dishes, which I would want to try the next time around.  You can pick and choose the type of meat for any of the dishes and also the spicy level.  The service is relatively fast and the cost is comparable to the other food court offered, e.g. Liberty Noodles.  There's also another Thai restaurant in the same food court that I plan on trying.  It's nice to have options, especially where food is involved."}
{"text":"Scotia Plaza Food Court - I came here during prime time lunch hour (12:30pm) and Thai Express had the longest line out of all the other restaurants in this food court.  Unfortunately, the length of the line is not proportionate to the quality of the food being served.  Did I order the wrong thing?  

I went with the basic Thai fried rice with chicken (has pineapple and tomatoes) for about $8.  You can specify the spicy level, so I went with medium.  The portion was large (came in a large sized Chinese takeout box), but it contained bland food.  The rice was kinda gross (not your high end jasmine rice) and it was seriously lacking in flavor, even though it had a mild spicy hotness to it.  The onion and carrots were hard, which would have been ok if the dish itself had some flavor to go with the vegetables.  I could have drowned it with soy sauce to save it, but I didn't' have any when I was eating.  I will not be ordering this again.  My friend had the pad thai, and it looked good and he said it tasted good, so I would try this instead of the fried rice next time.

The service was fast and they take credit card (both master and visa)."}
{"text":"This is my go to location for soup in the mall.  

I either get the small 'snack sized' soups for $5 when I am shopping and need something to tide me over. They are a decent size and have enough  to fill me for a couple hours. 

My most common order is either the vegetable Tom Yum or vegetable Thai soup- both extra spicy. The spice they use is a green chili, which tastes good with the soup.

 Tom Yum has more flavour than the other broths and it is a little more spicy than the rest. If you choose to add the coconut milk to Tom Yum it makes it really thick and creamy, but you lose ALL flavour and ALL spice, plus it gets cold a lot quicker because the milk they use is straight from a can. Thai broth is quite bland and so are the ingredients. But that is why I get the spicy chilies added. 

I get the vegetable soups, because I have tried the shrimp and chicken soups and I have to say I was disappointed. The chicken is really tuff and dry; as if was dehydrated. The shrimp when I had it was too rubbery and it made the soup taste completely different with an aroma I didn't find appetizing. So I stick to the veggies.

The service there is fine, nothing spectacular just mundane. Depending on who is taking your order they get annoyed with customers asking questions about the menu and what the ingredients are (the menu doesn't specify much about every course). Once you go there often they come to recognize your face and the order, but that is about all the outstanding service they provide."}
{"text":"I haven't had Thai Express in 2 years and I finally decided to give it a shot, remembering the Eaton Centre location being fairly decent. 

I order Mild Chicken Pad Thai and get in line to wait for my food. There's a bit of a mix up, someone ordered Spicy Chicken Pad Thai ahead of me but accidentally grabbed my Mild order because the cook told him to spice the Pad Thai himself with the nearby Sriracha sauce. The guy walks off and then they look at me and go \"Spicy Pad Thai?\" And I go \"Oh no I ordered mild.\" And then they try to offer me the box of Spicy Pad Thai to take instead, even though i had specified i wanted mild. I go \"I'm sorry, I can't handle spicy.\" And the chef doesn't seem too bothered and decided to make my mild Pad Thai.

The Pad Thai was really soupy, the noodles were rock hard like they were still dry and tasted like cardboard because of it. So basically I got cardboard noodles covered in watery sugar sauce. Not cool.

Side note I noticed when they prepare the food they put the receipt IN the bowl of raw food before they cook it. Doesn't look sanitary to me.

Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai with tofu, so good! The staff is super nice and the space is very clean and stylish. This is definitely going to be my designated post Costco run dinner spot."}
{"text":"Usually Thai has some healthy options, but not here. Fish - fried. Tofu - fried. Rice - brown not available. Cup of water - not unless you purchase it in a plastic bottle. And their spiciest level is still bland. You look at the menu, then go to the checkout line and pay, then return to cooking area and wait and wait and wait. Why put \"Express\" in your name if you're really more like \"Distress?\""}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai Express.  Usually go to the BP building to get my fix.

Went to Chinook this weekend and was somewhat disgusted when the chef started opening cupboards, moving a ladder, and touching all sorts of other surfaces with his gloves and didn't replace the gloves and kept cooking and serving."}
{"text":"Grand Opening night and they did great! Food was perfect!  Owners around to answer questions! So great I'm going back soon!! 
Day 2. Tom Yum soup. And it was equally delicious!! I'm so glad Ashley didn't let me go to spice level 4! I LOVE spicy, but this medium is SUPER HOT and perfect!!! I'm a def an of this place!!"}
{"text":"Quick service, done right. These days it's really hard to find the right pad sew at a Thai express. Thank you cross iron mills Thai express staff. Good on you!"}
{"text":"Great, delicious food and quick service. The Tom Yum soup was excellent. Wish it closer to where I live. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thai Express is a chain that you can find in most food courts. On weekdays, this location is packed ! 

For under $10, you get a generous portion of food. Whenever I have lunch here, I have the Pad Sew with chicken - the only thing is that it would be nice to have more vegetables in it. When this place first opened a few years back, the Pad Sew had a lot of vegetables in it.

There is a seating area for about 40 people. The turnover rate is pretty quick though so if you have to wait, I reckon it wouldn't be for too long. The gentleman who cleans your table is super friendly and will clean tables/put away dirty dishes right away.

Good for: quick bite"}
{"text":"Just tried for lunch. Ordered a bunch of things. Pad sew soya sauce with chicken. This had very little toppings barely any chicken or egg and maybe 3 pieces of green vegetables. Taste was alright got this flavor for my little one but the lack of toppings makes this a loser. Ordered the pad salad you pick your own flavour and meat and this is stir fried and out on some regular lettuce. Not sure this is a repeat either. The Thai chicken wings were good and Thai ice tea spot on. Overall quick place for carb lunch but seems skimpy on toppings for the stir fry noodles."}
{"text":"I just came home from the Dufferin and Steeles location. I experienced a very dangerous situation along with the worst customer service ever. I ordered a meal and told the lady when I ordered I am very allergic to eggs, so to please make sure my food does not have them in it. As I was eating my food I noticed I was eating egg!!! I went right back to the two staff and asked them if there were eggs in my food and they said yes! I told them both I had just informed them I couldn't eat that due to an allergy and they said \"oh we forgot\" It literally was just minutes after I had ordered my food, this was not acceptable for people like me with allergies. I asked for a managers number and they both tried to tell me there was no manager. I asked them \"when there is an emergency who do you call?\" Both staff said \"the manager?!!?!\" In the end one person called someone in the back room and when they came out they informed me \"the manager said there is no number???\" I was tired of the laughable runaround and couldn't take the risk of having my reaction in the restaurant, I needed to go home. To anyone who has allergies DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I use to come to Thai Express since its close to home. Love their Beef Pad See Ew. Its soft and juicy, and adding some chili makes the whole dish like heaven. I usually add some peanut on top. Would like to add the lime but unfortunately it's always dry, so had to skip it."}
{"text":"Decent food court choice.  Had the General Thai, chicken was way to crispy/tough.   The Vegetable stir fry with sweet and sour is good on steamed rice.  The chicken fried rice with basil was wicked.  Very good flavor for a food court.  Good for on the run."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with a fast Thai place. I'm used to more sit-down style atmosphere. This is like Thai food chipotle-style. You pick a dish, then pick a protein, then pick a side. Simple enough concept. The food however is slightly on the blander side. I had the green curry with chicken and that was decent, but my spring rolls and dumplings lacked flavor. I can appreciate the freshness of the products. I can taste the Thai earthiness. Overall, I do like that we now have a Thai option for the fast casual diner."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place and notice the cute little take out containers. Decided to give it a try this time around, and I was anything but disappointed. Ordered a chicken stir fry with peanut flavor. Delish. The peanut flavor was more subtle than I had expected, but it was still nice. Definantly worth making the trip back. Try new things as well."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in about six years. I remember it being much better. 

Peanut sauce is yummy. Everything else is kinda meh. We had the pad thai, the pad sew, and the yellow curry chicken on rice. I know those Chinese takeout boxes are cute, but they're so impractical to eat from. The put the rice on the bottom, and the curry on the top. It's nearly impossible to get both curry and rice on your spoon if you're starting from the top...unless you're interested in making a mess. Protein portions are also way small. Very few slices of beef or chicken in any of my three dishes."}
{"text":"Got the ginger stir-fry here today ($5.99). It's their current special. It comes with a choice of beef, chicken, veggies, or tofu. It also comes with rice. While I'm pleased that it was a regular portion of food, they seem to have gone light on the beef. I did see some, but my mother said that it was mostly veggie towards the rice portion. Also, and I know this is common with other Thai Express locations, the rice goes in the bottom of the takeout container, and the stir-fry goes at the top. This makes it fairly difficult to get a bite of rice and stir-fry, especially at the beginning when the container is full."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the \"fast food\" scene flamingo & 215 has. 

When you're tired of protein this or that and over tropical smoothie because let's face it, they ALWAYS mess up your order, just swing on by for something different!

I love Thai food, and although this isn't the most authentic experience it's absolutely worth it. User friendly, kid approved. 

There are so many options from food to drinks! 

We went with a stir fry, where you pick your meat/veg and flavor. We chose chicken & peanut. Mild heat. It was perfect for the kids if you're not into feeding them hot dogs & quesadillas every time you go out. 

We also enjoyed the green curry at medium heat. This was my 7 year old daughters favorite, to our surprise. 

Unfortunately the Pad Thai was our least favorite. It was lacking... can't quite put my finger on what it was though.

The mango salad was also a bit of a disappointment considering the size and I was hoping it would have a kick to it. It didn't. 

All in all the staff was pleasant and informative, the restaurant was brightly designed and very clean throughout. The food had both highs and lows but what place doesn't?

I'm eager to come back and try a different dish or three :)"}
{"text":"Do you like Thai food? This place has one of the best menus in the valley. Their red curry has such a depth of flavor that I can't seem to get enough of it. But the curry isn't the only star, the dumplings (fried or steamed) are so delicious as well as the egg rolls. The egg rolls have got to be one of the crispiest I've ever had. The staff is always friendly. Make sure you talk with Fo. He's the manager. Oh and the decor has got it's own swag. Bring a good size group cause it is always more fun to share a little bit of everything. I also recommend the Pad See Ew - choose your protien."}
{"text":"I got the soup there and it was terrible!  It had absolutely no flavour. I had to add spices when I got home.  It had hardly any beef or veggies all noodles and broth . I would not recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been eating here weekly for a year now and always get the chicken stir fry with oyster sauce. When I asked a question about the menu today the employee/owner (old Chinese man with glasses) was dismissive and rude. I just wanted to know if I could substitute veggies in place of rice. Needless to say I walked away and won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I should have turned right around and exited right as I saw a dish someone had already been eating off of get dumped back in the pan to get heated up!

The place has a very eye catching design that makes you want to come check it out. I enjoy thai food and have never been dissatisfied. Upon entering the establishment it's very cute and simple. 

There was a party of 3 sitting down eating. The lady complained her soup was cold and if she could get a hot one. The worker took her soup and behind the counter dumped it into a pan for reheating. I didn't see this pan cleaned nor a new pan replaced once the soup was done cooking. Is this sanitary? Especially because she had already been eating out of the soup!

I ordered the soy garlic stir fry with chicken (mild, the least spiciest), tom yum soup, and the pad thai with no added spice. The stir fry tasted as if nothing but peppers were dumped on. I normally can handle spicy, but after one bite I had to set this dish aside. The tom yum soup and pad thai had no flavor.

3 bites in and we just walked out. Waste of money sadly."}
{"text":"The portions of Thai Fried Rice and Pad See Ew aren't bad at all. This is our second visit at this establishment. The staff is always friendly and welcoming! Food is good as well. Also you can get Raspberry Pepsi! So good!"}
{"text":"great for lunch. 

this is the only thai express location i like. other sites just don't make it the same. love LOVE basil chicken fried rice. pad thai, pad sew and soup noodles are nice too. i get it just for the cute take-out box!"}
{"text":"Just gross. Foolishly went in looking for Thai food. This is bargain, anglocized Chinese food. I had the pad sew (what is that even?!) with chicken. I basically ate an ounce of chicken and a scrambled egg. It was food flavored food."}
{"text":"First let me tell you this I have no idea why you call this a thai food is more like Chinese food to me. The food here no way near thai it all. Never ever see a thai place serve a can thai tea. Is like you try to cut corner instead make it fresh. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Asian food, while I normally try to stay away form food courts sometimes they are un-avoidable! 

This place is ok, not where I would come to for an authentic Thai meal but it is palletable (you can still eat it). I normally always get the Pad Thai because I like the taste and with the right amount of spice any Pad Thai can be good! 

As far as food courts go, they are no better than any of the other choices but it a nice alternative to burgers and French fries."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, not all Thai Express are made equal. 

I tried most of the Thai Express in the downtown financial district area, also the one at Eaton Center, and also the one at Markville Mall in Markham uptown. I must say, this one by the Sun Life building is most of the best out there. 

So what makes this one stand out?

it's the chillies! 

Let me explain, I love spicy food and I've been eating spicy food for as long as I remember (perhaps ever since I begin eating solid food as a baby). I normally order the Thai Fried Rice, EXTRA SPICY. In this Thai Express location, they use real chillies, which makes the spicy taste real. In other locations, they cheap out and use hot sauce instead, so it's not actually spicy enough for me. 

Also, when you cook fried rice, you need to make sure that all the rice are colored. This is a pretty basic requirement for a restaurant, isn't this not? Well, this doesn't apply consistently to most of the Thai Express locations I have tried. However, I haven't been disappointed yet at this location. 

I must say, the line is pretty long at this location, and it doesn't move quick. I recommend going either around 11 or around 1 to avoid the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"General Thai Express restaurant, located in an office building.

The good: Food fresh and hot. Service is quick. Cashiers friendly. General Tao is tasty. You can customize your dish (I take mine without pineapples).

The bad: Pieces of chicken not always the same amount per dish (sometimes I have a lot, sometimes less (which is disappointing)).

Generally good service and quick. I usually return."}
{"text":"Ordered food for 10 people and the restaurant completely messed up the order despite calling ahead and ordering well in advance. It's not even an honest mix-up in the order, 3 of the 10 boxes of noodles were given to us without any sauce on them at all. Dry noodles and tofu. Whoever packaged this order could obviously see the noodles were missing sauce but gave it to me anyway. Not cool."}
{"text":"Certainly wish I had read these reviews before I stopped in, but I wanted a quick lunch and this was close to my hotel. The young woman barely looked up from her phone to take my order, then disappeared into a corner as fast as she could get away. My Tom Yum soup was extremely bland, the only discernible taste seemed to come from peanut butter stirred into the water.  There were some bean sprouts, a few shrimp, and noodles. And at over $12 for the bowl. It was definitely not cheap.  Lots of great restaurants in this neighborhood. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when they first opened and used to enjoy the food. The owner used to be very friendly but now it appears things have changed. 

The owners is not so welcoming anymore and quite grumpy. The staff does not speak English very well and you will find yourself constantly repeating your order. 

The quality of the food is average at best. Their Pad Thai is probably the best thing on their menu. I have also tried their Pad Sew which is quite average as well. Their General Tao is awful and drenched in sauce. 

More recently their portion sizes are shrinking. 

Definitely not going back anymore. The Thai Express at Hillcrest Mall (only 5 minutes away) offers better quality food, better portions and better customer service."}
{"text":"Thai fast food. I had the Thai soup with beef, and it was pretty good. If you make it a combo, you can add a roll and soft drink. The roll was also okay, it can with a ginger jelly to dip in. As for condiments, they have hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, fish sauce and chopped peanuts. No other chili sauce, although they gave me a little cup of crushed chili's from their food prep area. No soy sauce either. 

The drink is a Pepsi touch screen that lets you flavor various Pepsi products. 

You can park behind the restaurant and get inside from an unmarked door on the right side.

My combo meal came to be $10.93, and if you're not expecting fancy, you'll think this place is fine. It reminds me of a mall food court."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed but it's alright for fast food.. Plus it's something different than MacDonald's or Tim Horton's...."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great! We ordered the Pad See Ew, chicken pot stickers, yellow curry and got to try the pad thai soup. Everything was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"No! No! Noooo!! This is not thai food. The pad Thai and pad see ew were flavorless and consisted of all noodles. Where are the veggies?? Meat?? The yellow curry was white and had no \"curry\" taste.  The container was filled with steamed rice and covered with \"curry\". 6 pieces of chicken and humongous pieces of carrot,  bell pepper, and onion. Who does this? Restaurants usually serve steamed rice in a separate container!!  You are paying $9 for steamed rice! The fried rice was soaked in soy sauce and had no taste. There were 7 tiny diced carrots, 5 shrimp, 3 basil leaves- no taste!!! 
Ugh!! The competition down the street for Thai takeout is sooo much better!!!!"}
{"text":"Thai express is one of my many guilty pleasures, delicious chicken Pad Thai with medium heat, their new golden pad thai with egg noodles, are actually really good, they have a sweet savory sauce, that goes perfect with the egg noodles.
Their imperial rolls are amazing, so is their soups and the mango salad is refreshingly good, the new fried banana with drizzled chocolate is an acquired taste, some people love it the others (me) hate it.
Interior cosmetics, are lacking, the chairs remind me of school cafeteria chairs, what I'm essentially getting at, is that, the inside is nothing to brag about.
Now, customer service is okay, the cashier does her job, but you can tell she really doesn't want to be there, but who can blame her, on such a beautiful day like today, I wouldn't want to be cooped up either.
I gave them only three stars, because I've been to this Thai express many times before, and a couple of times they messed up my order, in my opinion, their pad thai is only good with the hot sauce, without it, the pad thai is quite bland."}
{"text":"Great vegan options! Customize every part of your meal.  Amazing pad Thai! Check out how big the spring rolls are!!! I thought the staff was very friendly and helpful. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quick & polite service. Great food! Clean facility. Definitely would recommend to anyone! (I got the tofu pad Thai and the veggie spring roll with peanut sauce)"}
{"text":"No idea why people complain about the service. Thai Express is known for their style of service. Order, pay and wait for food. Simple as that. I usually order the chicken thai pad, as it actually tastes differently better than other Thai Express I've been to."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but it's overpriced compared to the selection of Asian Cuisine in the neighbourhood.

I spent 10$ for a pretty small bowl of basically noodles, lots of sprouts and like, 3 pieces of beef.  

If I drove north 50 meters, I can spend 7$ (+ tip =$7.75), get a LOT more noodle, and A LOT more beef, with a much richer soup."}
{"text":"Hopefully, I'm reviewing the correct location: it was the Thai Express with the middle eastern place in the same building to its left, so if that's the one you're at; then, yes! I think this place is okay and you get a decent and huge portion for less than $10 including tax.

I was looking for a quick bite to eat close to the Sony Centre before a concert and had a hankering for Thai or Vietnamese food. I wish I'd found a Banh Mi, but being in Toronto with Verizon data charges meant that my Yelp app wouldn't work without wifi and I had no wifi. Damn.

I somehow stumbled onto this place, ordered the Pad See Ew with beef and had it in my hands, piping hot, less than five minutes later. They fried it up right in front of me; so that's how it done, huh? The gentleman taking my order asked if I wanted it spicy and I said yes and it did have a nice kick to it, although not being overly spicy. 

There are self-serve limes and sriracha, but all in all; it was flavorful. I enjoyed the beef and the vegetables, although the noodles were a little greasy and not the best, but served its purpose for being a quick fast meal before a show."}
{"text":"Dang, I loved Thai Express.
Earlier this year I tried pad thai for the first time and was surprised that I liked it.
When in the Square One food court, my boyfriend informed me that this was the best place for pad thai.
I ordered the beef pad thai and got it 2nd from the hottest, if you've seen the legend.
And OMG it was hot.
It was also delicious.
And humongous.
I had to put plum sauce all over it to cool it down.
I'm very picky with my meat and I loved the beef in this. And the tofu and egg (I think it was egg).
Super yummy.
It was about $10 for a medium pop, egg roll, and pad thai.
I would definitely get it again.
Just not so hot next time.  My nose was running, eyes were watering, and I was probably sweating... but it was so good I had to finish it."}
{"text":"Great spot to have lunch, I always get the general Thai and I like that they have a brown rice option for their food. Fair amount of seating but it gets super busy during lunch it can be a wait at times for ordering food but food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very good Pad Thai but needed a little \"doctoring\" at the condiment station. Probably my own fault for ordering at a 1 spice level. Added some siracha, lime and peanuts. The Thai restaurant I'm used to leans toward super spicy. This one not so much. I'd definitely go back. Would like to try their curries."}
{"text":"Come again delicious,  I tried the red curry and had to get the peanut stir fry..yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered pad thai with chicken and 2 spring rolls, which were all made very quickly and tasted just like, well, what you would expect from a fast-food Thai restaurant. It wasn't distasteful  by any means, but just keep in mind that it won't be authentic. Would definitely recommend when you're craving \"Westernized\" Thai food."}
{"text":"This is pretty decent if you want basic Thai food. However, between Bangkok 9 kiddie corner and the wet dog smell inside, Thai Express doesn't score as high for me. It's a neat concept, pick your dish, your protein and then your spice level and they cook it up there."}
{"text":"Not the best I have had from Thai Express. Lacks flavour and spice. Plus I ordered from the discovery menu and I was charged at regular price."}
{"text":"Ordered pad see ew, and it was so gross. The Spice was like sour yet flavorless. I don't even know how to describe it except the worst Thai I've had. Not authentic at all!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. I ordered the mini Tom Yum soup with chicken. Definitely lots of noodles but very little chicken. The flavour was good though and I did enjoy it. 

They recently moved into the North America Centre and due to the lack of options in the food court the queue at lunchtime has been quite long. 

The service is quick and friendly and the good thing about Thai Express is that all of their nutritional information is easily accessible online. The prices are fair and the food is good. I will definitely be trying more items from their menu. For now, 'A Okay'... we'll have to see if I become a fan."}
{"text":"I've heard great reviews about this place and decided to try it out on my trip last summer. Fast and friendly service coupled with fresh made to order food makes for a perfect dining experience. I wish they had a branch out in Los Angeles. 

If there was list for ten things to do in Toronto, I would say Thai Express would be on there. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Stop by have lunch here ...just want to try out new Thai restaurant near by my house..Henderson of course!! Good food and decent price .fast service and friendly employee and place is cute decorate my sister have soup and I have my favor dish * Pad See Ew * is delicious ...:)..yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I guess we should have known what we were getting into with a name like \"thai express\". The upside is it's fast. The downside is its really, really gross & overpriced for the quality. They put more time & money into the decor than they do the actual food. I guess we're just spoiled food snobs but I can't stand thai food that isn't authentic. We got the tom kha coconut soup which was so bad we couldn't eat it. The spring roll was also terrible with 99% lettuce. And the thai tea tasted so nasty we didn't drink that either. And we normally LOVE thai food & yes we walked in very hungry! I will say the service was great, the woman even came up & asked how it was but the look on my face said it all. I guess once you've had authentic thai food its hard to eat the generic kind. We spent almost $26 and could have went to a real thai place & waited 5 extra minutes. Please, don't waste your time & invest your money into the good stuff. Its so WORTH IT. I know some great places if anyone wants to message me for recommendations"}
{"text":"Have tried Thai Express 3-4 times hoping that the craving I get for it will keep me satisfied and time and time again I wonder why the hell did I choose to come here...I have tried the Chicken Pad See Ew..and the last part of that word explains how I felt about that dish. I have also tried the Chicken Pad Thai with just egg and bean sprouts - I did not like this dish either. They do give you a hefty portion which is great for what you pay for however I feel that the dish lacks a lot in flavour..so much that I actually get a headache after eating 2-3 bites. You can probably share one which can save you money - at least I certainly can considering I always toss mine out at half way point. 

I hope to go back to try maybe one of their rice dishes..however I am slowly coming to terms that no matter how many times I crave those noodles in that cute little green and black thai box with the metal clamp..I simply do...not...like....it."}
{"text":"Usually when I go to a fast food restaurant, I like when I'm able to see the kitchen. I know that, most times, the things that would gross me out the most would be the things I couldn't see anyway, but it's a small comfort. 

'Thai Express' allows me this comfort in the best way possible, by allowing me to almost stick my face over the pan, seeing the entire cooking process right in front of my eyes. How they're able to cook so quickly really brings validation to the \"express\" in their name. There's always a line-up at this location, but it moves quick and orderly.

The food itself is spot on. I may not be the best judge, since I've never had much Thai outside of my own attempts, but the Pad Thai (typically with beef) is fantastic. The flavours dance around in your mouth, jumping back in forth from sweet to sour in the most seductive and sultry way.

And, boy, is it filling. It doesn't look like much, but get it in a take-out box because it's not easy finish off, even though you just might want to! 

It does get a little pricey when compared to the other choices a few short steps away. Though, if you aren't pinching your pennies, as I often am, you can't go wrong with 'Thai Express'."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the finanical district. Though it is not easy to find as it is tucked around the corner.

Thai express has been expanding across Toronto, gaining popularity in its convenient way of offering quick thai food in minutes. Food is decent and cooked on the spot, under the blazing fire on the wok.

I also like the fact that you can add your own hot sauce, hoi sin sauce, peanuts or lime into your dish, located on the other end of the counter.  

I've had my share of food of Thai Express. The pad thai/sew and general tao chicken are decent choices, but it often leaves me feeling bloated as it is completely soaked in sauce. A bit too much for my liking."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for the past year and the service is always straight forward and good. I find that in other locations the food is either too much of this or little of that for our liking so we always just stick to this location when were craving thai express.

And for recommendations, General thai chicken and Beef fried rice are a must! 

I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this place. I love Thai food. I ordered takeout through my Yelp app, which automatically went through GrubHub. Upon my arrival, the gentleman (who I assume is the owner) behind the counter asked me to call the restaurant directly next time I want to order takeout. He said, \"I have to pay GrubHub if you order through them so call us next time.\" I understood his position as a business owner & I will keep this in mind the next time I order delivery or takeout through a third party company. But it made me question why he used that service if he didn't want to pay for it? I'm sure he has his reason, but I didn't expect to be told not to order through them.
I really liked the way the restaurant was decorated & the color scheme of it. But the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night. The most unpleasant thing for me was the smell of wet mop that I noticed as soon as I walked through the door. Also, the fried rice I ordered wasn't that good. It was missing flavor. I had to add some soy sauce from home to give it more flavor. Honestly, I'm quite disappointed with this restaurant. I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Habituellement très bien mais le service est très mauvais. Il a fallu 15 minutes pour mon saute, ce qui prend habituellement 4 minutes. L'organisation est pourrie."}
{"text":"This is was by far the worst Thai express I ever had! So cheap with toppings, I ordered fish pad thai and got a few tiny pieces that barely resembled fish! I don't mind paying for my food but I expect for 10 bucks some decent meal not a plate full of plain noodles! ! Never again at this location!"}
{"text":"Great place, the staff is super nice and the food was great for the money in the area. Generous portions. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Ehh, go somewhere else. Thai express is bland and not what I would call Thai food. The chicken in my Tom Yum was hard and obviously previously frozen. The soup flavors were disjointed, nothing blended well with the other ingredients. The shared seating space is dirty and not well maintained."}
{"text":"Snotty owner gave me shit for accidentally giving the wrong order claiming that it was already in the \"system\" and then made me pay for the difference (which I agreed to do) and then gave me attitude for my method of payment (75 cents on Apple Pay) i had to fake an egg allergy to make them change my order from Pad Thai to general thai. I hope he chokes on his so called system."}
{"text":"I generally like you Thai Express, you provide me a quick and cheap fast food alternative to good Thai Food, but damn you for stating that you're open 9-5:30 everyday and making me walk 20 minutes in the rain to find out you're already closed at 4!!!"}
{"text":"Rubbish, total rubbish. Can't believe they can stay in business.

Pad Thai, a very common dish tasted awful. Worst ever. My partner's meal smelled awful and she couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and boy did I regret it. While I didn't necessarily experience the terrible service other Yelpers have reported I can boldly state that the Pad Thai I got was very disappointing! If you want \"Thai\" food that is extra salty with lots of soya, this is the place to go. How something made to be awesome be taste so bland and generic is beyond me.

It's cheap but you certainly get what you paid for.,"}
{"text":"Fun concept! It's Thai food made quickly--ideal for lunch or a quick bite for dinner. The menu is small compared to most Thai places, but it carries my favs. I ordered the Beef Pad See Ew: beef was very tender but noodles were a bit too firm for my taste. Not inedible, but I just like my noodles softer. It also had a sweetness to it, so I wish they had some soy sauce on the condiment bar so I could add some saltiness to it. Fried dumplings and chicken wings were great!

I saw some reviews saying they don't have fresh Thai Iced Tea on the menu. Well, the restaurant listened and it is now available! Just not on the menu yet.

More than anything, I really enjoyed their service. The lady at the register noticed right away that it was our first time and kindly explained the menu. The chefs interacted with my 2-year-old son while they prepared food. When we tried the soda machine, it wasn't working. The manager sincerely apologized and gave us bottled drinks to replace them. Plus, the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"I have never experienced worse customer service than this location.  We have eaten here many times.  We ordered our usual.  Stir fried rice, pad thai, pad see.  All with medium spice.  Right away we noticed the rice was not cooked.  After a lot of arguing he finally took it back.  The pad Thai and pad see was full of spice!  Too Spicy to even eat.   So I asked for a refund for these and he refuses!  We had literally 2 fork fulls of it.  He says we already ate it and won't give me a refund!  Are you serious? I start to make a stink and notice other people complaining about the same thing.  The rice not being cooked properly.  THEY KEEP SERVING THIS SAME RICE TO OTHER PEOPLE.  Why serve it if so many people are composing.  Avoid this location at every cost!  I was a long time customer here.  Ate many many meals here.  The young Korean dude with the baseball cap that claims to be the manager is the reason I will never ever step foot in here again.  Great job buddy!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. A friend and i ordered the wonton soup and the pad thai. The chicken had a stench and was old and rubbery. The noodles went stale within minutes. We had to leave the food and walk out, it was that horrible. The sauce bottles were smothered, empty and dirty. THe dining room was filthy with garbage on the floor, looks like its never been cleaned. Even the tray we put our food on was sticky. 

Overall: 
Disgusting
Not clean at all
Food is stale and old

Do not go here! 
Cheers"}
{"text":"Nope. Not good. First time in today, we had a coupon so we thought we'd check it out. Ordered the Tom Yum Soup with chicken and Pad See Yew with chicken, two basic Thai dishes they should be able to get right. I wanted this place to be good because I like supporting new businesses In the area. The service was great but the food...not good. Not much flavor, the opposite of what Thai food should be like. I ordered mine spicy and I found myself adding more sriracha just to give it some flavor. Sorry, find a different place for Thai food."}
{"text":"I give 3.5 stars for the food, the great customer service bumped it up to 4. When I parked the car I could see the place was empty, and the staff was talking in the corner. Soon as we walked in, everyone dispersed, was attentive to our presence and greeted us at the door. That was awesome, now that's a warm welcome!

The place was nice and clean, it shows they care even when it's slow. The owner took our order, explained the menu and was patient with our questions. He made the suggestion to try the Pad Thai and make it a combo, which includes the drink and egg roll. We ordered that and the Tom Yum soup with chicken.  Feel free to stand and watch your food being made :)

I like the drink bar with the schnazzy automated Pepsi kiosk. The bar also had the sauces and utensils available.  The food was decent, I say this because it's not authentic Thai food. It seems more Thai inspired. For example, the Tom Yum soup is basically pho with coconut milk and spice added to it. But it was still tasty!  The Pad Thai was good also, a little on the sweet side.

One suggestion: if you can afford nice plates, forks for silverware and wooden chopsticks, please get some nice soup spoons as well. Those plastic flimsy spoons don't cut it.

Come in with an open mind this is more Thai fusion (in my opinion). I'm definitely returning to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"This Thai Express seems like a classier establishment than the usual basement-level food court Thai Express in downtown. You can sit for dinner here. They had some renovations done so it feels like a restaurant.

I ordered the yellow curry with chicken, fried rice with shrimp, and fried chicken. It was actually pretty decent for around $35, and made fresh to order. Would I recommend such dishes on a regular basis? Probably not since it's quite heavy and in the fast-food category. But for a casual dinner when you don't want to cook, it's totally fine.

Although they close at 8 on a Friday, I was there around 8:10 and they were still taking orders."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst combination of terrible tasting food and high prices.  I am Thai and none of the 4 dishes (Pad Thai chicken, Pad See Ew, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Yellow Chicken Curry) that I ordered tasted anything remotely flavorful. 

 If you order the curry, be aware they fill the bottom half/two-thirds of the tiny takeout carton with rice so you are really paying for white rice.  The curry was bland and the incorrect color and not spicy at all. Plus there was giant onion/bell pepper/carrot mix that would be more appropriate for a skewer for a grill than any Thai dish.

The fried rice was sadly terrible and I am unsure how you mess up fried rice but they managed to do so. It was heavy on soy sauce with some minimal effort to 7 pieces of diced carrots and smidgeon of basil and peas.  I can hear my mom rolling in her grave at this assault on Thai food.

The Pad See Ew was serviceable for a person learning to cook Thai food but that is about it.  While there is one piece of chinese broccoli, noodles were soggy and dripping with oil.

The Pad Thai was drenched in some sauce with minced chicken, and I appreciate the effort to include bean sprouts BUT where are the peanuts? Tamarind? Green onion?  I thought this was Thai food.

If you eat here, then prepare for disappointment or lower your expectations to make it tolerable.  Better yet, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"me and wide had a lunch on our trip to erin mills mall.

this is a mall restaurant that is a part of food court, however the food that they are making is exceptionally good.

I had PAD see and my wife had PAD ki mao both of them were excellent.

Next time when I am in Erin Mill Mall i know where to go for lunch."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick thai lunch fix. This is the spot.
Love the spicy chicken pad thai"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a place nearby the office I was working at that had vegan options listed on the menu. I asked for my pad se ew extra spicy and I thought it was pretty good for a fast food Thai joint. I would have preferred some extra veggies in the dish since I skipped the egg so when I return I'll ask for something to sub for the egg."}
{"text":"I think I end up here everytime we eat at the Pickering Town Center food court. It's either this or one other option haha

Their noodles just seem a bit more firm than other locations where I've honestly had noodles that were just... one.. shape.. on my plate. As in they're all mushed into a block and melted into eachother.. Here, they use a nice constant high heat on the noodlles and toss them quickly to get the airy noodles. It doesn't feel too fast food-y which I always appreciate. Staff are fairly friendly.. nothing special really.

It's a food court. You can't expect all that much other than a decent quick bite. This place offers up food that's just not doused in oil, so it's a good choice :)"}
{"text":"Thai food made by chinese people.  Every dish has the same, boring, unoriginal base of chunky cut green peppers and onions which are never cooked enough in the wok.  Questionable meat quality too.  The \"McDonalds of Thai food\" I guess"}
{"text":"Tasteless, overcooked meat, overpriced.  

I should have known better when I decided to come here.  I've had it a few times and each time it was less than good.  I learned my lesson not to get the chicken because it tastes like left over turkey.  So I thought I'd go with beef pad thai.  Asked for less sauce, medium spice.

What I got tasted pretty much the same with regular sauce.  It's too sweet.  Now I know why the chicken always tastes like left over turkey, it is all cooked ahead of time.  Same with the meat, if not entirely cooked through I would say it's mostly cooked.  Therefore when they actually toss your dish together it's really quick.

Technically your food is not cooked fresh in front of your eyes, everything has been partially cooked.  Beef was passable but not even.  

I usually don't throw away my food but I threw half of it away.  

Wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Fast food Thai Food, what do you expect?

Now with many locations in the GTA, this was the first place where Thai Express was introduced. For something that's fast food it's pretty good.

You have the usual pad thai, general tao, fried rice, and soup. Each come with an option of meat or veggie at a different price. As well you get to choose how spicy you would like it. If you're use to spicy food I would go extra spicy b/c it really doesn't kick in unless you ask for extra spicy.

The two servers at the front are very friendly to me and still give me a discount even though it has been years since I've worked at Sherway Gardens.

For fast food don't expect to get the greatest Thai food ever b/c you're not. You're gonna get something that will set you while working or shopping at the mall. The price of the food is decent however you can get better tasting Thai food at about the same price if not more at a way better restaurant.

Items to definetly get

- pad thai 
- tom yum soup
- pad sew"}
{"text":"I'd like to give 5 stars and maybe will be able to on the next visit. Flavor, portions, and the restaurant itself were perfect. The owner was there and was very kind. He is still training his staff and once they get through the opening new business growing pains I'm sure they will earn that five star mark, from me. 
I had the cashew stir fry with chicken, I give it a 4.5 for flavor. The shrimp spring rolls were the largest I've ever had and were perfect. My wife ordered the Thai fried rice, but they made a mistake and gave her the basil fried rice. The flavor was good but not what she wanted. We'll definitely be back to try it again. Pricing is fair."}
{"text":"Awful service and bad food. Took them ages at the counter . When we got the food it had no taste and portions were small. I have been to many other branches this is by far the worst"}
{"text":"Ordered tempura udon, beef ramen, gyoza, and Korean pancake. All tasted good, esp. the noodle and gyoza. Price is good too."}
{"text":"Ended up eating here because Thai is delicious and it's a mall food court, so I thought I would take the safe bet. We ended up being the last people to order which might explain the unsatisfactory experience? but after reading the other reviews I don't think so. I ordered some  chicken, rice, and vegetables with some sweet and sour sauce on the top and a ginger ale to go with it. I guess I can't really complain to much since it is mall food, but the food itself was just very bland and left much to be desired. On top of that paying $23 for anything in the food court (for 2 people) is a reminder as to why you should always go eat at an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Thai express seen it alot and heard about it. The place is nice and very fas service they have over hear. You can watch them cooking which is cool. Most people were getting it to go and eat in dine in as the go to basket is cool and I wanted to try it as well. Over all the place is decent food is good but over priced a bit as I will expect couple of dollars cheaper. I had better thai food so I would not say it is the beat. But I will recommend the place as they have many locations. This location is really good compared to the rest."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some Thai food. I have tried couple of other Thai Express locations but this one beat them all. I have the best Thai Express experience. It just tasted better also make sure you put the nut mix on your food. I ordered combo number 5. I will definitely suggest people to try this location."}
{"text":"Everyone at this Thai express should be fired including the manager. Give the business to someone else. The food is not up to standard (Thai express standards), the wait is longer than the mall, and the staff simply don't give a #@$&!"}
{"text":"Great, quick Pad Sew!  Brand new location, clean and a definite return visit in my future."}
{"text":"Je commence a être pas mal habitué a cette chaine de restauration rapide mais plus santé que plusieurs autres. Celui de l'île Perrot est aussi propre et efficace que les autres. La soupe Yum Yum aux crevettes ainsi que celle au poulet était très bonne avec juste assez de citronnelle.  Avec le combo je commande habituellement un rouleau printanier mais a ce resto il semble qu'ils n'en servent pas. Seulement l'impérial qui est frit. J'en commande donc un et ce fut le point faible du repas. Rien de grave mais c'est du congelé que je me fait a l'occasion en manque d'inspiration et de temps a la maison. Le poulet général Thaï comme il est nommé ici était très correct.  Excellent service au comptoir et très rapide."}
{"text":"Très ordinaire
Soupe tumyum sans goût. Payé un surplus pour le lait de coco. En attendant en ligne depuis plusieurs minutes, un cuisinier qui nettoyait l'équipement au lieu de servir les clients s'est enfin réveiller pour faire ma soupe. Fauteuil très inconfortable et salle de bain malpropre."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor to the area and I've never seen a Thai Express before. I stopped in at this one on a whim and ordered their Pad Sew with chicken.

You know, I'd say it was nothing remarkable but that's sort of expected for a fast food style Thai restaurant. The noodles weren't bad tasting, but they were just sort of... there.  The chicken was no different, and the little egg roll that came with the combo was completely forgettable.

I mean, it's fast food though, right?  What do you expect?  Surely that's worth three stars for food that's not actually BAD.  At least, that's how I usually make the distinction between two and three stars.

Well as I sit here on a work night at 2:05 am, trying to keep my mind off of the pain of the food poisoning symptoms by writing a Yelp review, I can honestly say that the matter of the star rating did not require a whole lot of thought.

It's going to be a long night."}
{"text":"Pour le prix, les portions sont bonnes. Si vous avez le goût de manger du sushi, il y a un Sushi Shop dans le même restaurant."}
{"text":"Just a regular Thai Express BUT the cashier may need a hearing aid - Asked for Shrimp and she was like \"chicken?\" and I was like \"no, shrimp\" and she was like \"so, chicken and shrimp\".. \"sigh.. no\"

Wasn't asked about heat - didn't think to ask because of the whole chicken/shrimp thing.

Spring roll was mediocre, semi undercooked, lukewarm.  Rice underneath also could be fluffier - almost tasted day-old.

NOTE: I'm pretty sure this is the right Thai Express that I checked into - it's on King at Yonge."}
{"text":"For Thai fast food I guess it's reasonable. I lilt that you can choose how spicy you want any dish to be. Im a spicy food whimp but I love Thai so being able to choose is a bonus. Just keep in mind this is a fat food place in the food court and you should be ok with what you get. Try the lemon grass soup but make sure you get the noodles on the side if you take it home. There's one dish that I get when my tummy is upset and I'm pretty sure it's just noodles and soya sauce so as I said pretty simple dishes. Overall you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"After flying in to Toronto, picking up our rental car and preparing to head into the office, I decided to have a quick lunch at Thai Express in the Yorkdale Mall, near the office. BIG MISTAKE. Out of all the choices in the food court, I chose this? Why?
This place is insanely busy. Guess lots of people want to get their Thai on at lunch. We get up to the counter. We order fried rice and pad thai. When I attempt to pay using my credit card, I'm told they only accept debit. I give the clerk my debit card, which clearly says debit and I'm told they don't accept it. I try proving to the clerk that it is, in fact debit, before becoming frustrated. I give her cash and ask sarcastically if they accept cash. We wait for 10 minutes. Our dishes are prepared. We were never given our drinks and had to return to the same server to request our drinks. She'd forgotten if we paid for them at this point and attempted to dispute. Look. Bottom line. Whole lot of drama for very little in return. Avoid the confusion, the hassle and the lack of taste, hit up one of the other vendors at the food court. You'll leave full, satisfied and with lower blood pressure. Also- tip- they only fill fountain drinks half way, so order the bottle. At least you'll know what you're getting. Thai Express- the express train to lunch hell."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh and delicious food is always the best when having a busy schedule. Thai Express at Square One cooks Thai Food that is not truly authentic albeit maintains flavors that will make anyone's taste buds wanting more. 

During my last visit, I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai ($8.58) and my friend ordered the Tom Yum Mini Noodle Soup ($3.38). Both items were cooked fresh when ordered. The Shrimp Pad Thai tasted amazing with the right amount of sauce and noodles. The Mini Noodle Soup was not too spicy but had just enough flavor. Portion sizes for both items are big (just the way I like it!). 

The service is decent and needs improvement. When ordering our food, the lady expected us to know the Thai Express menu and different varieties with each item contained. 

Thai Express at the Square One is amazing. Although the service is poor, the food tasted amazing. I recommend this to everyone who is looking for a quick lunch/dinner after shopping."}
{"text":"The pad sew (thick rice noodles) is so yummy here I have random cravings for it!

Yes, the line-ups are long and the prices are typically overpriced for downtown toronto foodcourts.  Still, this is as good as it gets for a quick fast lunch."}
{"text":"(I'm hoping this is the location in The Core shopping centre!)

Just started going here again in Calgary. I loved Thai Express when I was living in Montreal. Even at lunch, this location is fast, they keep the line moving, and I love all the options. You get TONS of food (I usually eat the chicken/veggies and can't even start on the rice) for the price. My favourite is the chicken stirfry with peanut sauce but it's all good - and you get to pick how spicy it is (beware - they lean on the spicy side... I love spice but I usually get Medium and it's got plenty of heat).

My only laments are that 1) you don't get the food in the little cartons like you do in Montreal (it's normal styrofoam containers here) and 2) they can be a little short with you to try to keep the line moving. It's a bit of a jolt to newcomers, and they speak so fast that sometimes patrons get confused, but overall I always enjoy my experience with this fast food joint."}
{"text":"Love their pad thai! Sadly i can't seem to find any pad thai better than this. Maybe lots of msg is the secret. Thai Express's tom yam noodle soup is pretty good as well.

The service at this location is decent. However, like with many other Thai Express franchise, I wish they take hygiene more seriously. Cooks here touch ingredients barehanded and it always makes me disgusted."}
{"text":"Fast Thai food as the name suggest. No frills, no surprises and decent mall food. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Best location and the are always nice and the food is amazing and fresh and they send by mail coupon for great deals so that's nice too . So high recommend this place 10/10"}
{"text":"This is really a three and a half star place.

Thai Express is a bit hotter, fresher, and more expensive than your standard Asian restaurant. The food here is good, especially if you are a fan of fast food Asian.

You can find parking in the covered lot behind the restaurant. The staff here are friendly and the place is clean (either because it is new or because it is kept clean).

A standard meal here costs 10-13$, a bit more than McDonald's, but perhaps on par with similar fast food."}
{"text":"Fire flames, quick and easy Thai food. 

If you're hungry/ not trying to break the bank / and mess with Thai food.... this is the spot. 

Quality food quality style. Cool vibes and weird color combinations but I love it. 

Eat here and don't be mad about your life. Enjoy yourself, and have a good day."}
{"text":"Clean and modern atmosphere with a hint of fish sauce smell.
Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, but had more noodles than anything. 
The fried pot stickers went well with the peanut sauce. Fried egg rolls (Imperial Roll) was bland.
The manager and staff were courteous and accommodating.
The prices were similar to an Authentic Thai Restaurant for the amount of food that was served at Thai Express."}
{"text":"I typically love Thai Express and have never had a bad experience there until today. We went around 2 and only 1 employee was working, no other customers. Most of the tables hadn't been wiped and the self service station for sauces was very dirty, lots of crusty sauce that had hardened a long time before today. While waiting for our food I visited the washrooms and was appalled by the state of them, I've never seen a truck stop so dirty before, feces on the toilet that hadn't been cleaned in god knows how long, a layer of dust and hair everywhere and their were a couple rolls of toilet paper in the washroom randomly to use, instead of in the dispenser. 

We ordered the Pad Thai and the General Thai with beef, the Pad Thai was okay but my beef on the General Thai was very under cooked (photo attached). Very unimpressed. I'm not one to complain as I've worked in customer service and food service before and understand things happen but this place is horrible. Don't go there if you don't want to get sick!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nicely done as it represents the Thai culture in a contemporary setting. The food I ordered was the General Thai Express. It was lacking flavor. I like the fact they had condiments like fish sauce that can enhance the flavor, but I didn't bother getting any of that as one should try their food first without adding salt. I got mine to go, and they had everything placed inside the traditional take on the Chinese take out box which was fancy, however, it was hard to eat everything in said container. I would recommend using to-go trays for food items that are combined (main dish/rice...etc) It was mushy when I opened it. Customer service was great though."}
{"text":"This place has to be hands down the worst Thai place
I've ever tried. My wife and I called them up for take out. My order consisted of 3 items. They told me to come by in about 20 minutes. After a little over 20 minutes, I drop in just to be told that they haven't even started the order yet. I asked what happened and they said they've been getting some fake orders over the phone that day so they decided to hold off on orders. Had I been told that when I called originally, I would not have tried this place out. The serving sizes were VERY small for the price and the quality and taste was sub-par. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I took delivery on the way home & the guy took all of 15 seconds to make my order- 3D Red - Veggie. There was not enough curry, it wasn't hot enough (if u order in the morning, u can't touch ur food for 10 min & it's tasty too). I was left with just plain white rice & onions, that's it.

The problem with these joints in food court is that they don't give a damn.... well.... not any more.... we'll change their attitude, one review at a time..."}
{"text":"we decided to give this place a try. I order the beef basil with steam rice.  The rice was old so it was hard crunch instead of fluffy.  Rice is the basic and you can't even get that right? 
Also the manager was speaking down to his workers and giving them orders quite rude while he was taking our orders at the same time. We will be going elsewhere as there is way better thai food further down on Stephanie & 215."}
{"text":"Thai food is my second favorite and i had try a lotplace around Asian. In America my favorite Thai restaurant is Thai Style Noodle house. Today i have lunch near by W Flamingo and saw this Thai Express. Let's try it. Go inside i'm the only customer there. The place very clean and look new. I had tom yum soup noodle with beef. It's terrible. Soup was not hot, noodle so dry and all the veggie not cook at all, beef so smelly. It the worst Tom Yum soup i ever have."}
{"text":"Alors pour être express, c'est vraiment express! À chaque fois que j'y vais, je suis servie en à peine 10 minutes! J'ai mon petit plat favoris: le pad sew au poulet! En plus, les quantités sont, selon moi, amplement suffisantes, j'ai souvent du mal à finir mais la gourmandise fait que je le finis toujours! Et le prix? Plus qu'abordable!

Ce que j'apprécie surtout c'est qu'on les voit préparer notre plat, ça permet de surveiller un peu ce qu' il se passe en cuisine! Et c'est toujours impressionnant de voir les grandes flammes qui atteignent presque le visage du cuistot!  


Si vous avez une envie soudaine de manger thaï vite fait, thaï express fera l'affaire!"}
{"text":"Pros:

Good flavor
Quality ingredients

Cons:
Skimpy portion size. I left hungry (or at least not full) compared with Pei Wei where I usually need a to-go box."}
{"text":"Went there only once after work to get take-out and, honestly, not a fan.

First of all, the menu is very limited and quite pricy.  I ordered a pad thai and it was very dry, small portion and didn't have a lot of shrimp in it.  My husband had the Tom Yum (soup) and he said it wasn't anything to write home about.

I'll give it two stars because at least it seemed clean."}
{"text":"Great food and even better staff! Ron V. offered us buy one get one free meals since it was our first time trying it and even gave us a free fountain drink! Excellent customer service all around, would highly recommend trying the food."}
{"text":"Thai Express, is a fast food place. It serves traditional Thai cuisine.  There are more than 200 locations across Canada and worldwide. The food served fast, taste fresh and authentic.  The prices of food are cheaper than many other restaurants. When I have food at the food court, Thai Express is always my first choose because it's fast, clean, healthy and tasty. It provides a great quality of food. The one I have been on last week is located on Crossiron Mills Outlet food court. The same as before, I have ordered General Thai (Chicken) with Medium Spicy combo to go. After took the order, the cook began to cook my order for me in front of me. The food came very fast and warm. The vegetable was fresh and well cooked, but the meat tasted a bit of old and overcooked. They put too much sauce in my food, which made my food having super strong flavors and salty. They gave me more meat and vegetable than rice, which was great. In summary, I really like this Thai cuisine place. Strongly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is all hype. 

During the lunch hour, the line up is insanely long but to try them out, I waited patiently like everyone else to see what the hype was about. After eating their food, I still don't understand why they're so popular. 

Because they're express, you get your food in under two minutes. All of the meat and shrimp are pre-cooked. To prepare for your dish, they heat up your meat either by tossing them in the wok or plopping them into a vat of hot water. Personally, I don't like this process. Cooking raw meat at a high temperature doesn't have to take a long time but anyway...

I ordered my chicken Pad Thai ($6.99) medium spicy. It's a generous portion of noodles, meat and veggies but it tasted OK. Their version of medium spicy is mild. You can also add toppings separately like chopped peanuts and slices of lime. 

Thai Express has a lot of noodle dishes, soups and curries, but frankly, I don't think I'll come back to try them."}
{"text":"Just got home with our food and tasted it and it was awful. Ten minutes later and i feel completely sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I tolerate the service here when Im really hungry but there are instances, like tonight, where the service simply isnt worth the warm food. 
First of all, there never seems to be a standard of where to order food - sometimes it's at the counter, and sometimes at the register. Tonight, it happened to be at the register though, like most times, there was no indication. After having waited to be served for 5 minutes, was directed by the cook to order at the register which, at the time, was unmanned. There was a younger girl stocking shelves and another older woman just talking to her, but taking no real interest in the fact that there was a customer. I walked over to the side she was closest to and waited a few minutes before they decided it was a good time to stop their conversation long enough to tell me to walk over to the other register. This could have stopped here. Instead, as Im walking over, she takes someone else in front of me! Was clearly annoyed and her colleague noticed and offered to take me, but at this point it was too little too late. It should NEVER have taken 11 minutes to take an order at 930 at night, when there are so few people!! When I brought it to her attention, all she can tell me is \"he was here first\" (which, YES, he was at the other register first because he'd heard her tell me so) and then has the BALLS to tell me \"I was just trying to help you\"... WHAT?! HELP ME?! Ive just been waiting ELEVEN MINUTES just to PLACE AN ORDER! I didnt want to give them my business anymore, so I walked away, too tired and annoyed to be hungry. 
If you have the time to waste, and a lot of tolerance for bad customer service - go for it. Otherwise, do yourselves a favor and find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Love their noodle soups! Better than most pho places in durham region with the exception of viet delight!

Almost every time we are in the Pickering Town Center, we end up eating here.  Their noodle soups are fast, packed with vegetable and oh so comforting blend of soup and noodles.  

As far as fast food goes, this is top notch and I don't feel guilty grabbing a quick bite here."}
{"text":"Rude service. Food below average. Was ignored for  5 minutes.  Ordered green curry tofu to go.  It had curry flavor, but was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"This is my mum's fave place to eat.  She always get the mini chicken soup and add noodles for 50 cents.  Total amount of mini soup dish $4.30 + gst.  Satisfying meal with loads of fresh vegetables like bean sprouts, finely julienned carrot, onions & cilantro.  

Good meal, satisfying and yet cheap if you don't want to eat a full meal.  Of course, Thai Express also has the regular sizes and other dishes that are stir-fried like Pad Thai."}
{"text":"The most attitude I've ever received from a cashier. The cook was indifferent, which was fine, but when I ordered my food and literally took 3 seconds to decide on one item, the cashier actually turned around, made rude remarks in Chinese and kicked the kitchen door open and stomped off. The only reason why I didn't complain straight to his face was because I didn't want him to spit in my food (or worse) because clearly he had ZERO sense of professionalism. It was 8:25pm and the restaurant was closing at 9pm but I was only ordering takeout. If this location doesn't want business past a certain time then they should just close early rather than treating their customers like shit. I already have super low expectations for service at fast food places but this was shocker. I will NOT be going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place that has ever existed ! Not kidding one bit. The food is surprisingly unfresh and possibly toxic. I got sick for 2 days after eating from here. The second I took a bite of that food disgust permeated from my stomach and taste buds. I got a vegetable rice stir fry - should be simple enough. The food had a fishy after taste and all the vegetable tasted like they were canned. Not fresh at all - unfortunately I had to learn it the hard way. Take my advice, avoid getting sick and NEVER eat there. Don't say I didn't warn you ...."}
{"text":"Oh Thai Express how I love you! 

This location is located in the Meadowvale town centre plaza and is its own store. It has cute green and clear chairs to match their logo. It's pretty Spacious too, so there's lots of room and plenty of parking. My 2 faves to get here are the Pad Thai w/ basil and Chicken fried rice w/ basil and shrimp. Lime on the shrimp is definitely a must. I just love how the basil just adds a zing to everything! I know it may not be real authentic Thai food but it does taste good. 

You can sit down here and eat it off or you can take It to go with those cute little green boxes they put your food in. You can also see  when they're cooking it so you know what goes on in there in your food. Thai Express gets 4 stars from me. I am Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Amazing food and they really give you a lot! The Thai soup is amazing and so is the general Thai and pad sew! 
My only concern is the rising prices over the past year which is starting to make me not want to eat there as much."}
{"text":"Quick and easy comes with a price. 
Order at the counter and choose your \"base:\" curry, pad thai, pad see ew, fried rice, etc. Choose your spiciness, meat and decide if you want to make it a combo. 
Ordered a shrimp pad thai for $10 and some change. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was done in less than 5 minutes. Portion size was small. One chinese takeout entree container size. If you're looking for a quick meal to go, this might be great, but the portion size and taste wasn't worth the convenience for me. 
The pad thai was heavy on the fish sauce smell and was a little too oily and bland. 
The restaurant has a lot of tables to eat at, but I think it would be better to just take out. The restaurant smelled a little too strong of fish sauce!"}
{"text":"I came here at 1 PM, I got a Tha? soup with vegetables and the combo with the spring roll and a drink. There was a line up on that day and the customers all dazed off in that particular time. Every time a dish is ready, the staffs didn't call out the dish they made and the food just sit there until the staff asked which dish is this for. I wasn't sure who made my food but the cashier seems to do it for me after she takes care of the customers. I think this place either lack organisation or they don't know how to communicate with the customers. 

The food is plenty but I had better... 

Overall experience, meh..."}
{"text":"Thai Express... One word; convenience. 

It is a franchise with okay food. The service is not bad for this location of the town and the servers are doing their best to serve their customers. I would applaud the cleanness of the place except... The washrooms locks don't work. 

Overall, this place is good for a quick bite. I wouldn't stay too long to hang out since there are many awesome cafes around the restaurant to chill at."}
{"text":"This Thai Express just opened a few months ago so I figured I would try it out. 

First impressions were positive with a clean and current atmosphere. Very nice place I would have to say.

Food was fast and tasted awesome...with cute little take out boxes. Keeps the food nice and hot till we got home. 

My one head scratcher was that they had a Consumers Choice award for 2016 on their door... Makes you wonder how they won an award for 2016 when they just opened. I guess you just buy those awards to make ppl think your awesome.  The good thing is that they backed it up with my first experience so hopefully they keep up the good work"}
{"text":"2.5 out of 5.  I'll bump it up to 3 as the eating surroundings are simple and nice!  

Checked this joint out as it is a dual Thai Express and other side is Sushi Shop.  I had sushi as I ate a huge lunch today.  Sushi shop to me is the lesser side of mediocre.  They cut their sushi fish as thin as Tim Horton's cuts their bacon.  You couldn't think fish could be cut so thin!  They must use lasers to do it!  Anyway, I found the rice a bit too sweet and rice texture didn't taste as fresh even though we ordered it ahead!  Also I believe they sell sushi @ \"highway robbery\" prices.  This is Montreal sushi however and as I've mentioned before I'm spoiled as I have Vancouver and Toronto sushi to set the bar for me!

I actually try to avoid eating sushi here in Montreal as I know it's usually way too expensive and quality is questionable!  Call me a sushi snob but I eat it it quite a bit!  Check my other reviews if you don't believe me!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai Express outlet. I've been many times during lunch and I usually get the chicken pad Thai and Thai soup with chicken. They're both decent and help curb the craving. Service is pretty fast here too. For a fast food joint the taste is pretty good and value is there especially with a small bowl of the Thai soup for $5 that comes with rice noodles and one protein"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times now. Love the Pad Kee Mau. The problem is that the veggies used aren't always fresh. A couple weeks ago I had to throw out the baby corns as they were very sour/old. Today, the carrots were sour/old. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Ordered the rice noodle and chicken soup and found hair in half way through. My friend ordered the green curry chicken and we were like where's the chicken??? There was only a few small pieces of chicken drowned in green curry and they filled the plate with green pepper and onions. Will never eat there again! 

Now a year later and I still haven't returned! Rather go to Toss Thai!"}
{"text":"For airport food you honestly can't expect much. Most places are fast food places, and their quality is usually lower than places not in the airport. Looking at the negative reviews for this place, I feel some people's standards might have been too high when they shouldn't really have set their standards such way.

Anyway, I chose Thai Express while waiting for my flight to Winnipeg, as I wanted some pad thai and not burgers/sandwiches. I will say though, service was extremely slow here. The time between me ordering and getting my food was about 25 minutes...that's not fast food.

As for the food...as I said, it's airport food quality. It's certainly not the best Thai Express I've had, but it's edible food that didn't get me sick. That's honestly all I can ask for."}
{"text":"I love thai food so I decided to check this place out today. The interior is very cute and clean. Menu has a decent amount of options and includes every major protein choice. We decided on the basil stir fry with shrimp and red curry with shrimp plus 2 eggrolls. We got our order to go and were pretty disappointed upon opening our cute containers. Both containers are filled about 90% of the way with rice and the other 10% is the actual dish. Flavor is subpar. Very basic non authentic thai with little taste. Each eggroll is $1.88 and although tasty, they're the size of your finger and not worth almost $2 each. I would compare it to a thai version of panda express but with way less flavor and way less food."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this did not have any Thai taste or look. The spicy red curry was not spicy and had an odd color and little flavor. The basil fried rice again had no flavor, the beef was tender but the basil almost tasted like baby spinach. The staff politely refunded the meals. They offered to make us something different, but we are sure we are not a fit. Really liked the concept and hope they do well."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a quick, light lunch here and enjoyed it. The food was pretty good for being quick and inexpensive. I'll definitely keep this spot on my short list when I'm in a hurry.

We ordered Pad Thai with beef, General Thai
Chicken, and made one of those a combination to get a fountain drink and an Imperial Roll. Each meal is ordered by choosing the meal, choosing the protein, and then choosing a spice level. We liked the Pad Thai, but the beef wasn't my favorite. I'd try a different protein next time. The General Thai Chicken was our favorite. We liked the sauce and it had a nice amount of vegetables. The Imperial Roll was good and we liked the dipping sauce. 

The inside of the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The fountain drink and condiment area was clean and well labeled. The employee that helped us was friendly and thanked us for our business as we were leaving. She offered to explain the menu when we arrived too. 

Friendly service and good food at a reasonable cost!"}
{"text":"My bad eating adventure in Montreal took a nose dive on day two of my conference.

The 'group' opted to get something fast and close by.  Biggest mistake.  Why? Why? Why?

I ordered Pad Thai.  

More than generous proportion on my plate of noodles that were not pad thai noodles.  When asked about any veg added - the server pointed at the bean sprouts... meat? dry.  Flavor? Ugh. Peanuts? No where in site.

I ate 1/3 of it and felt sad that the rest ended up a gloopy mess in the restaurant's garbage.  Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, and great service. I think it is No.1 Thai food restaurant. Food is totally different than other Thai Express."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. The owner, David, is so down to earth and services/greets each of his customer with a smile. Highly recommended! One of the best Thai Express locations I've been to!"}
{"text":"Food is homemade... fresh.... delicious ... service is excellent.. reasonably priced... can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is the best very delicious food made to order. I love the thai soup everything on menu you'll love the flavor....."}
{"text":"Hrmm.. well I need to put in my own two cents here. I've never had the curry at Thai Express -- because I am in love with their Pad Thai and will order it everytime - making special care to duck out of work early so I don't get stuck in line. Unlike Thai Island, their Pad Thai is not pre-made and waiting in a warmer, which I find causes the noodles to stick together. The  Thai Express Pad Thai is made to order, which means they stir-fry it AFTER you order it and serve it to you fresh! This is also how they serve it in Thailand. You can choose how spicy you like it, and there are limes and peanuts on the side to add to the Pad Thai. As for the taste -- it's not ketchup-y; it's just GOOD. As for the price, yes, it's about $8 but if you look around the food courts nowadays, that is pretty much in line with all other food stalls. At least this tastes good!"}
{"text":"NOW OPEN. Same location as Sushi Shop -- in a shared cafeteria. Place is very clean. Food is fresh and delicious. Had the tom yum soup. Very large portion; healthy, tasty and well priced. 

This location is new, but not easy to find. It's just off Decarie (Autoroute 15 S) adjacent to the Walmart parking lot. It is a small place, cafeteria style, in the same building as Sushi Shop. Very good choice for a budget-conscious traveler, for lunch or dinner. 

Please note, this place closes early (weeknights at 8 PM)."}
{"text":"You got what you paid for. This one is so much better than other Thai food locations. Normally I wouldn't want to pay over ten bucks on my lunch so I come here and grab a bite."}
{"text":"This is food court food. Located in the plus 15 network. So came here and got yellow chicken curry. I do like the food. I just wish there was more sauce. Lots of chicken that is for sure. Also its not that spicy and this is a plus. 

Food is quick. Seating wise, well I was able to find a seat quickly but the other option is take the food upstairs to the office and eat there."}
{"text":"Walked in here expecting a lot better than what I ended up with. I was looking through the menu and didn't see anything that really would be easily eaten at a hotel. A lot of soup items.. didn't think it would be good so I ended up getting the few things that were just rice and meat type of dish and ended up getting the Thai chicken stirfry. It was absolutely disgusting. I ate a few bites and just tossed the rest away. What a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"It does the job! Had some late green curry and a soup. Not the best out there but no one's expecting that, right? Perfect for a \"healthy\" late night snack."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it!! Very fast and great service. The tom yum soup is delicious"}
{"text":"I rarely try new things... My husband brought me here...ITS FABULOUS!!! The customer service here is superb they did a great job accommodating my pickyness! They are so very friendly I would most definitely return! And the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Expensive and slow. For a chain this location doesn't seem to meet any consistent standards. And there is nothing more frustrating than restaurants that have basics on the menu but then don't offer them. Shrimp or chicken cold rolls are a basic that any self-respecting Thai restaurant carries but not this one. Disappointing and have to stop coming here completely."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of this place. 

I ordered the pad Thai and peanut beef stir fry to go. The flavours were boring and I found the rice and egg noodles made up for at least half of the small box. I wished there was more lime and peanuts in the pad Thai and wanted the peanut stir fry to be more peanut-y and veggie filled. 

I paid just under $20 for both these dishes and regret the money spent. Next time I'll be sure not to stray from my ol' faithful in Newmarket. 

Also, no coconut rice?!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it was just OK. 
My family and I ordered through the phone and got to go because we were given coupons from the mail. Their customer service is super friendly and the place looks super nice.
However let's talk about their food. Their food was okay, but it was very different. I thought this was going to be more of an authentic Thai food restaurant, but it is not. I think it is more of a fusion. 
We ordered yellow curry, pad thai, thai chicken wings, and pad see ew. The curry was not what I was expecting at all. It tasted mostly of pineapples and the potatoes were still pretty hard. It did not have a curry like consistency either, it was kind of chunky. The serving size was super small too. The pad thai was my favorite our of everything, but it was also a very small serving size and a little dry. The chicken wings were just normal wings to me and the pad see ew was alright as well.
I will give this place another try because it is still brand new, so hopefully they take these reviews seriously."}
{"text":"Picked up Thai Chicken Curry here. It is not the real deal, but no one expects that at $9. Then again, why not? We have actual Thai folk here in Canada and in Thailand this food is street food and cheap.
Speaking of which, I am pretty sure no one working there is from Thailand. Oh well.
As for the food it was pretty good. It was freshly made right in front of you and the ingredients seemed fine. The rice was well made.
On the flip side, I am pretty sure this stuff is 1,000 calories and badly fattening. That would be the main reason I would not go back.
All dishes (Pad Thai, Green Curry, Chicken Curry, Fried rice, etc.) come with a choice of tastes/ingredients like red, yellow, etc which means you would have to choose between pine apple, aubergines, etc.

Final word of advice: the cute take-out boxes contain sauce, meat, stew on top and the rice at the bottom. Please mix well before eating or like myself you would end up with two parts to your meal: meat/vegetables/onions and then saucy rice."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered food from here...arghhh! Ordered the Chicken Thai Fried Rice. Didn't know it came loaded with onions. Four, count them four pieces of 1/4 inch wide Chicken shavings, really?... The rice was overcooked and lumpy. I can cook better rice and faster. Waited 20 min for my food. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing this place since I came to Montreal, and decided to give it a try two nights ago. I stopped eating fast food 7 years ago (McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, etc) but this menu seemed a little less bad, so I tried it. 

I ordered a meal sized portion of Tom Yum soup, and the vegetable fried roll. It was pretty bad honestly. I mean, I was expecting it to be kind of crappy, with over bearing flavors hiding the crap ingredients like cheap asian etc, but it wasn't even that.

The spring roll was alright, it was about as good as the frozen ones you chuck in the oven, which I actually like. But this was $3 per one, and kinda small. Anyway, gobbled it and on to soup.

The soup was pretty big, but when I opened it and tried it it was pretty bad. It just tasted and looked like sprouts floating in boiling water. After stirring a bit, I found noodles and two shrimps, but the shrimps were kinda gross tasting, and the soup just tasted like a stock cube. I was starving so I drank about half the soup and then left it. Really unimpressed. And alright Tom Yum is not hard to make.

I won't order from here again or ever go. The whole thing was like $16, and there is a Pho place next to my house that sells great Pho for $10, I will ALWAYS go there over Thai Express. In fact I would even if it was $20.

Remember, I am aware this is a fast food restaurant, and the review reflects that. ie, Harvey's would be 4 stars, McDonald's 3."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by the service and food here! Came here a few weeks ago and ordered 2 imperial rolls. You could tell they were sitting out all day long and were completely soggy and tasteless. Came back today and asked how long the rolls were sitting in the warmer for. He said since the afternoon, so I asked if he could make new ones and he said no because the fryer was already off. Absolutely horrible service"}
{"text":"I adore Thai food!

I tried Thai Express in the Scotia Plaza a couple years ago ... I wasn't impressed.

The St. Clair E location recently opened and I thought I'd give it a try.

I ordered the yellow curry chicken.  They boil the chicken to heat it up!  Ewwww!!! They add it to some fresh peppers, onions and pineapple.  Then they mix in some heated yellow curry sauce.  Finally they dump it on top of a bed of rice.  With the pop, it was almost $11!

I know it was fast food but it was nasty!  There are some good Thai fast food restaurants that blow this one away.  I don't understand the line-ups I see for this chain at other locations ... there are much better places to spend your $$.

Never ever ever again!"}
{"text":"Thai Express great for a fast lunch. I ordered the Chicken Stir Fry. It was fresh hot and ready for takeout in five minutes. I was asked if I would like it medium or hot spiced. I went with medium, thank god I did. Their version of medium had smoke signals coming out of my ears, I broke into a sweat moments after the first bite. Had to turn the air conditioner on in the car Wow! It was spicy hot but awesome!

Only negative there was very little chicken I had to hunt for it deep in the rice.

Lots of parking. Will go back."}
{"text":"Let's cut this to several points.
I love thai express, it's a quick and easy pad thai to eat (I always order pad thai).
It's the first one I try this one.

If you're on a rush, no problem, because service is really really quick !! You order and get your meal within 10 minutes for sure. 5/5 for that.

I asked my plate to be very spicy, and saw that the guy did not put any in my plat so I asked him again and he said ok. Not sure he understood.. he gave me my flat pad thai, and I asked him if it was really spicy he just pointed at the sriracha sauce without looking at me. It irritated me a bit.  2/5 for that.

There was no lemon. I read in another review that were used to be flies on limes but I think this time of the year flies are gone. I asked politely for lime and had to wait 2 minutes to get it.
I must admit, there might be a language barrier, they mostly spoke chinese I believe .. but still !! 3/5 for that.

Food was okay though, once I decorated my pad thai with the peanus, lime and sriracha. Generous portion!
4/5 for it.

No chopsticks to be found, 2/5.

Overall since the quick service and the ok food, i'll give it a 3/5. It'S OK."}
{"text":"I ordered a mini bowl of chicken tom yum soup, but they really skimmed on the chicken. I only got 2 pieces of chicken and a few crumbs lol. The soup didn't have the tom yum kick to it and the tomatoes in the soup also tasted spoilt."}
{"text":"The service was great very polite cashier and order was correct except for I ordered medium and had no flavor at all the pad see ew I recooked it and added spices since it was bland the eggroll good but very expensive for the size would never order again, mango salad is in insult no flavor 7 thin slices of mango Not even half of a mango and a bed of lettuce bland the most bland salad ever had in my life I never take the time to write reviews but this is a disappointment since it's so close to my place and was looking for a new Thai place. Rather then charge 9 dollars for a salad but make it worth eating."}
{"text":"Talk about hitting the spot. This place is pretty good. When they say express they sure mean it. My food was out very fast. I got the pad Thai, spicy, and they spicy it very well. Not too spicy where you can eat the pad Thai and still get a little heat. They also have things with rice. I high recommend."}
{"text":"I bet they aren't here in a year. The food is what we called \"drunk food\", strictly filler after a night of hard drinking and you don't care about quality. I don't see how its gonna make it with at least 2 other AUTHENTIC Thai restaurants within 5 minutes  of this place.  I got spoiled living in Thailand but have found several places better to go to to than here. Pad Thai was mostly chow mein noodles, no egg, almost no meat. You'd be better off buying a cookbook and going to international market and making it right then you'd be really pissed at how simple and cheap it is to do yourself. The price was ridiculous. I paid basically 25$ for a couple small  orders of mostly Chinese noodles    Place is clean slick and yuppified but  I'm feeling major ripped off for trying a new place but you live and learn. One star because I can't give zero stars."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Not a 5 star place though. I think people who are giving it lower rating are not getting their rating counted because they didn't write a long enough review and Yelp is publishing those as 'tip' instead."}
{"text":"Best food court option in the Pickering Mall.  Its a nice change from the greasy fried options of the other choices or the overpriced Subway option.  I stick with the classic Chicken Pad Thai.  Add a little lime and crushed peanuts to enhance it a bit.  They offer the choice of mild or spicy, both are great.  If you are not a huge fan of spicy foods,  go with mild.  At Thai Express spicy does mean spicy.  In terms of a food court experience this place is a 5 star."}
{"text":"Not busy at noon. Seems pretty clean. 9 for a couple spoons of chicken and a ton of rice. Chicken a bit dry too. Menu very limited. Crossing off the list."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time today and the only problem I have with it is that I fear I will want to go every day! Best Tom Yum soup I've ever had...the noodles that came in it were perfectly al dente, lots of lusciously prepared veggies, a huge bowl, slightly delicate flavor - a lovely surprise because much of the Thai food I've had is rather on the rich and overly-flavored side. I didn't realize this until today.   Also (because they suggested) I tried the egg roll that comes with a (refillable) soft drink for a couple of dollars and wow! That unassuming little appetizer was a taste sensation ...usually these are just \"meh\" but the crispy-crunchiness and the freshness of mine were absolutely delish! I will go back in a heart beat. Want to try everything. Also: the decor is gorgeously hip, colorful, immaculate, slick high tech. I felt very comfortable - good feng shui. (Nice, clean environment and pleasant atmosphere is a must for me at any restaurant.) The staff was good-humored, welcoming, helpful, explaining everything easily. (Note to self: must cut back on Netflix snacking, lol.) This is a wonderful addition to the Whitney Ranch/Sunset Station neighborhood. P.S. It's in the same parking lot as Mimi's Cafe. Now that I've given this review, I'm a little worried it's going to be mobbed from now on, but I wanted to give it a boost because we need really good food that's not too pricey. Apparently, it's a chain of three hundred in Canada, but the first in the U.S. So glad it landed here!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to food court place whenever I go to Chinook. Those moments when I don't have much time to think about food but I know that when I go to Thai Express and order Red Curry chicken no bamboo extra sauce I'm in for a warm meal with really strong and good flavors (maybe a little sweat from the heat). I don't expect to get the freshest food from a food court place but most of the ingredients on my plate tasted fresher than your regular food court standard. I can't give it a full 5-star rating because I cannot be forgiving about a Thai place not serving good pad thai. It's the most common Thai dish, how can a Thai place not make it good?"}
{"text":"I have been to several other Thai express locations and  I do like some of their menu options but this location ranks on the bottom for me.

First, the service is very rushed and they will frequently get your order wrong. They also don't give you much meat and vegetables, it is mostly noodles. The broth also tastes watered down. It was convenient to have a location close to work but it is not worth it to order from here. Go to one of the many other food options nearby."}
{"text":"I went here more than once because I am usually in the area. 

I often crave for Thai express but all there times I have been I was not impressed. There self serve sauces are never refilled, also looks empty and the same when I see it, meaning they don't change the bottles? or clean them possibly, I mean this is based of the looks of it. 

The servers and cooks have no personality, I mean there is no customer service at all here, they look tiresome. 

The food is ok for a quick craving, I have had better, but this is also a fast food joint so you can't expect to much. I know for sure after I eat at this particular location my stomach feels the pains :(. 

I wish for high hopes for improvements because this is the quickest way for me to get my pad Thai fix when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My seven year old daughter and I tried out Thai express on Thursday after school. We typically get panang curry or pad kee mou at Thai places. This place had neither and a poor selection of food. We ended up getting the general Thai chicken dish with white rice and I got a soda. Their Pepsi was out, so was the diet, so I got root beer. The chicken was overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. Maybe they use a microwave? It was good sauce, but we could tell the ingredients were definitely not fresh. I tried to find soy sauce and the cashier took me to their side table by the sodas and showed me a bottle in a hole that was labeled \"fish sauce.\" But the bottle was green and said \"seasoning sauce\" or something. I told the guy that I'm allergic to shellfish, and asked what was in it. He said soy sauce. My daughter and I poured a bit on our white rice. It was NOT soy sauce. We ended up eating the tiny breaded chicken pieces, and some vegetables and plain ol white rice... all for $17. They were nice, so they get 2 stars. I'll never be back, nor ever tell someone to go there."}
{"text":"This place has beautiful design. Very nice wall graphics. Variety of food choices. Great ambiance. Food is freshly cook in front of you and it's definitely a gourmet cuisine out in a fast food concept. Friendly service and last but not least, food were delicious. Definitely will come back for more. Must order a Pad Thai Shirmp Medium Spicy, spring roll and chicken wings."}
{"text":"I would give the food 5 stars and the staff! Everyone here is very friendly. The food is really good too. If you like spicy definitely order it very spicy, I've never had it too hot here. Everything I've tried was very flavorful. Their fish option is really good with the pad Thai. We discovered this place only like 2-3 weeks ago and have been there about 5 times! Try it, it's convenient and the prices are very fair too!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for the price, but \"fills you up\" is probably the best way to describe it.  Based on the fact that this is a tiny place situated in a commercial offices building, I guess they're doing their job to feed the office folk during lunchbreak.  But just barely."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, and I live in California...but my mommas favorite food is Thai food- so for this Mother's Day I ordered delivery from here to get dropped off at my moms work. They got it to her in a timely manner and the lady on the phone was so sweet!!!! Also- the to go boxes are the cutest thing in the freakin world  thank you Thai Express, for helping me help my mom have a great Mother's Day surprise all the way from Cali"}
{"text":"We just moved to this area and I am so glad that we have a thai express in our neighbourhood! I love their Tom Yum noodle soup. It is probably the only dish I like at Thai Express but I don't mind ordering the same food every time because it is REALLY GOOD!! At this particular location, for the take out bowl, they also use an additional layer to separate the noodles from the soup which prevents the noodles from overly soaked and soggy when staying too long in the soup. I really like this detail, and think they take their food seriously even if it is just \"fast food\" or \"express food\"."}
{"text":"I love Thai Express but this location is terrible. I have 1 hour for lunch and I spent all of it waiting in line; 15 mins to order and then another 40 mins waiting for the food to cook. Thai \"express\" it is NOT!  Really disappointed with a terrible waste of a lunch. Will not be returning to this location. Go to Hillcrest mall location, way faster and more generous portions too!"}
{"text":"I always get a craving for the red curry chicken...so today, I decided to feed that craving and get some! I can't really comment on the ambiance, since I am in a food court. However, the service is cold and abrupt, which is expected from a mall restaurant, I guess. The food is prepared quickly though, which I appreciate.
As mentioned in a previous check-in, their red curry sauce seems to be a lot spicier than in other thai express places I've been to. I only gave it 4 stars due to the service, but the food was good."}
{"text":"I loved the food. I ordered yellow curry with no vegetables. Very flavorful for an express restaurant. The sitting area was comfortable and the manager was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Quick, fast Thai food. They will even customize the order. 

Did a great job with the custom veggie orders and made it spicy.

The fried rice is kind of plain, but everything else is great and flavorful."}
{"text":"Decent location; super fast and friendly staff. Not much to say...had beef fried rice, pineapple, only found 1pc of tomato, more pls, more green onion too, it needed more colour."}
{"text":"I had a craving for green curry and I live at Yonge and Finch where i knew Thai Express  is at the concourse of the 5650 building. There was a line up which gave me hope that it could be good since there were pp in line and sitting down eating. I ordered the green curry as I envision a saucy green curry with rice noodle. When I ordered I asked for veggies and if it including tofu and it didn't. You had to pay extra for the tofu. I ordered it anyways in hopes the extra cost would fulfill my craving. While waiting, I asked to put the noodles in a separate container and the cashier had to make a comment that the request should be asked at the cashier. Really?. I said I only realized I wanted it separately as I didn't want the noodles to soak up the curry sauce. When eating the curry I did not like it, the curry was bland and starchy tasting and there was no real appeal to the curry infusion. The saucy portion was lacking and the veggies were not how I envision green curry with besides the tofu. Unfortunately I should have known based on the reviews that this place is just below par. I wouldn't suggest foodies to eat there as the standard is comparable to bottled curry."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the chicken Pad Thai! Me and my partner love this place and would recommend it to anyone who comes to the mall! The owner is absolutely wonderful and always a pleasure to talk to! Thank you for having such a great Thai restaurant so close to home!"}
{"text":"I had a pad thai craving and wanted something quick, close and cheap. So of course Thai Express was the only option. It's been a long time since I've been. The food is what it is and as some review said it really is the McDonalds of Thai food. I've had some awesome Thai food in Toronto so this was of course not even close to that quality. Still I got the chicken pad thai and it was not bad. It was a lot of food for 9 dollars and I was able to satisfy my Thai craving. Definitely a good option for a quick, cheap meal but don't expect amazing quality."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch with friends. We had the shrimp spring roll and peanut sauce, pad thai, red curry, and 2 drinks. Altogether, the meal cost $26, which I think is overpriced for what you get. Each dish was just ok in terms of flavor and kind of skimpy on vegetables and protein (i.e. there was no egg in the pad thai and the red curry had 2 pieces of chicken). On the contrary, the interior, to include bathroom of the restaurant was clean. Friendly staff. However, when considering the price point for food quality and quantity, Thailicious is still the best spot in town."}
{"text":"Stay away from the tofu!!! Inedible!!! I ordered the noodles with tofu, and when they asked if I wanted it spicy, I said yes. OMG! I love my food spicy, but it was almost too spicy! The tofu itself was terrible!!! 

So...

The noodles themselves were actually pretty good. So this is why I am giving it 3 stars. 

Noodles good; flavors alright; too spicy; tofu absolute crap; price a bit high ($8), but you got a lot of noodles."}
{"text":"1st the ordering system is weird
There are two fast food spots but ordering is near the tables..very confusing..

2nd they rush the food.
Fried rice is something i always get at other locations and i have had this happen before so it is not only this location but the rice is white when its suppose to be a nice rich brown color.
All the flavour in their fried rice is in the sauce. 

The rice is also mushy ..something seems odd..
Im not super picky so ill still eat it but its def Not great in compassison to how it should be.

Staff are very friendly
Again cant find a fork need to go to the back where the tables are."}
{"text":"Weekday evening at 8PM and it wasn't busy.  I ordered the pad sew with chicken and mild (I do like you can choose the heat level of your food) and my friend had steamed rice with veggies.  Our order came to about $17.  It was cooked and served quickly and hot.

I was disappointed with my meal as there wasn't much chicken but some egg.  It was also a bit greasy.  My friend enjoyed her veggies with rice and oyster sauce.

Ok for food court fare but there's lots of selection so wouldn't be my first choice to eat."}
{"text":"Thai fast food? I like it! A great place to come for lunch.  The pad thai and curry are both very good.  The portions are huge, but so are the lines.  If you come here for lunch, expect the line to wrap around the corner.  But, if you have the time and patience you should not miss out on this!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. I am rounding up. 

I seem to be on a mission to visit every eatery in this plaza. For a while, I have been eyeing visiting Thai Express. 

Last Wednesday, I decided to stay in Mississauga overnight. I needed to catch an early flight the next morning and wanted to sleep in a bit. 

After work, I headed over to Thai Basil. I was promptly greeted by the woman at the counter. She then realized that the other customer had an issue with his payment, so I needed to wait a bit. 

The menu is on crisp TV screens. I went with the basil fried rice. I got chicken with it. I chose medium on the spiciness scale. 

My food was prepared fast. I was impressed! I got back to the hotel and ate it in my room. It was delicious for fast food. The chicken portions were generous, as were the ingredients. 

You can pay by cash, debit, or credit card. 

I'd come back here again to give the other items, such as pad Thai, a try.

{"text":"This place is a Franchise and everyone of them are pretty ok for the price. The whole point with that restaurant is to get something to eat ASAP for your 30 minutes lunch break. 
I like the General Thai (which is a version of General Tao). There is plenty of chicken, rice is well cooked and sticky and the sauce is pretty good too. The way i see it his in 30 minutes, in that joint of the city, you have very few choice and this one will get you filled up for 10$ max! The Spring Roll are ok too. Pretty cheap and massive (maybe a little too massive; tough to eat it properly).

They take interact and credit card.  I'd rather eat there then Mcdonald."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai express i have been to. The staff are very nice and efficient. Food portions are hugeeeeee and the taste is just great!!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you're a busy on the go kinda person. This is the kind of place I would go to for lunch or a quick snack but not fancy dining, that's for sure. It is what it is. Fast food Asian dining."}
{"text":"Not been to too many Thai places but this one I really liked. The staff was effient, though not all that friendly but the food was really good for the price and that is all that really matters."}
{"text":"In the cutthroat world of mall food, Thai Express stands head and shoulders above the competition. There is nothing like seeing and hearing the searing sizzle of a fire pounding the bottom of a wok while noodles, egg, tofu and chicken come together in the symphony that is a spicy pad thai. Garnish with limes and smother with peanuts, and you are set to enjoy a piping hot plate of goodness, enough to sate you as you return to work. I usually have to wear an apron to avoid messy splotches on my white shirts. So good!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, consistent and service with a smile.. what more can u ask for a Thai fast food place."}
{"text":"I'm extremely upset at how I was treated at this location. The cooks inadvertently forgot to make my noodles and after I confronted them about it, the \"head cook\" (the guy with the glasses) LIED and said the food was prepared, but when he called out the order, someone else picked it up! I paid for my food and moved to the right and waited to get my food. I can see what the 2 cooks are making and NOT ONCE did they make my noodles! Just confess and say \"we didn't see your order and we will make it now.\" Don't outright lie and say the food was made and was given to someone else! The guy with the glasses also accused me of \"stepping away from the counter, that's why I didn't hear him call out my plate.\" Because I just wanted my refund now, I told him \"YOU ARE RIGHT! YOU ARE RIGHT! YOU ARE SOOOOOOO RIGHT!\" Just to shut him up! Also, it's very cowardly that none of the staff wear name tags. I wanted to call this guy out. Please tell the workers at this location that when they make a mistake, just own up to it and correct the error! Don't lie to make yourselves feel better! It just makes them look bad and it makes Thai Express look bad ... it makes all Asians look bad. I can't comment on their food because I didn't get a chance to eat there, but with their poor attitude, bad customer service and outright lies to the customers, my guess is that they don't put in that much effort in making good food either."}
{"text":"This place just opened a little while ago. For a new place, they are operating pretty smoothly. I ordered the green chicken curry and it was very well done. Lots of great flavor. My husband ordered the pad Thai with tofu and it was also very tasty. Thai Express is exactly what we needed in this area."}
{"text":"Thai Express has an awesome setup inside. I really like the interior of the restaurant and decor. They also have a wide variety of Thai dishes to choose from. I'm coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Best new secret in the mall. Came here for lunch and loved it. The food is cooked to order, not sitting under a lamp all day like a lot of Asian food places are doing it these days. The staff was friendly and helped me figure out the menu quick."}
{"text":"Colleague found bug in her soup while we were having lunch we picked up from there. Enough said."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Thai Xpress today. The manager was super friendly, and explained the concept. It is truly a normal Thai restaurant menu just pick your protein and your preparation, to serve quick style much like Pei Wei. The pad see ew (Drunken Noodles) with beef was amazing!!!  The stir fried chicken with vegetables, while not exciting, was well-prepared and exactly as we had ordered it. I had to spice it up! We were offered complimentary soft drinks as well, since it was our first visit. I have to admit, I will be adding Thai Express to my lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"I frequently visit the Thai express in this food court.  But the line ups is crazy!!! My favourite item to get is the beef pad sew.  Which is the thick ho fun noodles with oyster sauce and beef with Chinese broccoli.  Sometimes I get the pad Thai but it's too sweet to my liking.  I got the rice bowls with general tao chicken before it not good. Since the chicken are pre-fried.  It tasted a little stale and not fresh.   The noodle soup is also excellent for food court standards.  If you're not that hungry you can get the smaller version of each soup called the snack size for $5!  I like the fact that all the items they make it from scratch in front of you.  You can ask for certain amount of spiciness in your food as well. If you go at lunch be there at 11:30am anytime after that expect a huge long line up close to 30 mins +!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of Thai Express fast food restaurants over the years, and this one stacks up average. I wasn't asked for spice level and in the end, wasn't spicy enough (I ordered beef pad sew). Imperial roll was cold. I usually like Thai Express food, so I kinda expected better than this, especially at such a busy location."}
{"text":"This Thai Express location probably had one of the better cooks out of several locations I've been to. Since I work nearby, the location is pretty convenient and I usually find myself frequenting here a lot when I crave fast takeout. They definitely live up to their EXPRESS name.

My go-to order is the Chicken Pad Thai, ordered spicy or extra spicy. If you really want a kick, get the extra spicy - the regular spicy is either hit or miss. Noodles, meat and veg are consistently cooked well here. 

Other dishes I've had include the Beef Pad Sew, and the General Thai. I don't really stray away from the Pad Thai too often though.

The limes here need to be a bit more on the fresher side however. I always find them to be too dry that when I squeeze them out, only a couple drops come out. 

Also, the price tends to be a bit higher than other locations. Pad Thai here is $11.05, as opposed to $10.75-ish.

---- UPDATE ----

Went last night and opted for the Spicy Beef Pad See Ew, just for a change. Eating there on a somewhat regular basis, you notice a couple nuances between the cooks.

The beef from the Pad See Ew during lunch hour is a bit on the chewier side, perhaps from cooking too long, but tonight's was a lot more tender. I hate using this word, but I can only describe it as being more \"moist\" than its lunch counterpart.

Could be a fluke, could be a new preference in cooks at this Thai Express location.

My rating still stands at 4 stars."}
{"text":"Adequate fast food...
What you see on the menu IS NOT what you get. 
Plates are lacking vegetables and meats, loaded with rice and noodles. 
Brought this to the attention of the staff, cook was rude and only willing to add the vegetables, if I paid more!

When you need a quick fix it will do but it will not be what you see on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is quick and fresh! I love locally owned and it's great to have a quick Thai restaurant with fresh ingredients around the corner. Highly recommend their spring rolls and General Thai Chicken."}
{"text":"I've been watching and waiting for this place to open for some time now so when I saw the \"Now Cooking\" sign up while driving by yesterday, I knew I was going to have dinner there today. Sadly, my anticipation was met with disappointment. 

Quick overview - order a dish, pick the protein you'd like in the dish, spice level, add a combo item and drink, they cook it then call you to the counter to pick it up. The soda fountain is a Pepsi Spire fountain - Pepsi's version of the Coke Freestyle fountain. Next to the soda fountain are the utensils and the condiments which included fresh limes, chopped peanuts, fish sauce, and hot sauces. The dining area was clean and the decor is cute and trendy. 

On to the food. I ordered the shrimp fried rice - Thai style, made it a combo with a mini bowl of tom yum soup + fountain drink, and a spring roll. The shrimp fried rice was the best thing I ordered. It was flavorful and tasted true to Thai fried rice. There was a good amount of shrimp and they were pretty big, too. I did have one bite of crunchy rice, maybe scrapings from the bottom of the rice cooker, but otherwise the rice was nicely cooked. Next was the beef tom yum soup. Tom yum is one of my favorite soups and I always order it when I eat at a Thai restaurant. But their tom yum was not like any tom yum I've had. It looked like a tom yum but definitely didn't taste like it. The broth was almost flavorless, except for a slight sweetness that was off putting. I added a spoonful of fish sauce and that made it a little more palatable, but it still didn't taste like tom yum. No lemongrass flavor, no spice, just a bland broth. Last was the spring roll. The spring rolls are available right up front, next to the register. You just grab and pay for it when you order your food. They're huge but that wasn't a good thing because it was so overstuffed it just fell apart. When I unwrapped it, the rice paper stuck to the cling wrap, tearing the fragile rice paper. After a few bites the whole thing just fell apart, leaving me with spring roll salad. I ate the shrimp and tossed the rest of it. 

The owner/manager came out to ask how the food was and greet the customers, which was nice. I know it's a new restaurant and they're just working out the kinks but they've got a long way to go."}
{"text":"Worst Thai Express I've ever experienced. A fast food place that isn't fast at all. There's always a back up of hungry customers waiting for the slow staff. The kitchen is filthy, disorganized and the staff seem to just be staring off into the distance rather than paying close attention to what they are supposed to be doing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch since it was new and had just recently opened. Had the pad thai with chicken mild. It was just enough spice freshly-prepared really tasty. Would definitely come back to try more stuff"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this location, being situated amongst many great Asian restaurants. I was sadly disappointed in both items I ordered: General Thai Chicken and Red Curry Chicken. 

The General Thai chicken consisted of small flavorless chunks of dark/white meat plus the gizzards (gross) enclosed in huge glops of batter. The outside of the batter is very tasty, but inside it is not fried and tasted like 3 day old dried out muffin.  It had the consistency of dried our wallpaper paste!! 

The Red Curry chicken has a tasty sauce, unfortunately they poured so much of it over the rice that it became Red Curry soup . 

The chicken was dry, flavorless chunks of rubbery mystery meat that had no resemblance to real chicken and tasted like I imagine it would taste to lick a chickens butthole!!  Wtf!!

Pushing all that aside, I held up hope that the rice would be good....right?  Oh hell no - it's plain white rice!!

Ermmm eshcuse me..., where's the JASMINE RICE PEOPLE??  Helllloooooo
I have 2 positive comments:
Fountain Pepsi was fizzy and perfecto 
Staff was friendly (and cute - for any single ladies in their 20s)
Ohh nice Decor with clean tables....that's 4 positive things I can offer - or 5 if u count cute staff 

Never eating from any Thai Express again - no matter which location...it's official - THEY ALL SUCK!
Express to the trash bin"}
{"text":"Meh, food court Thai food. Nothing special a little too greasy and very standard. I guess I'm glad it exists, but I often think hmm I should have just gone to Edo for veggies and rice as it's waaay less greasy and just as tasty."}
{"text":"Despite the weird set up for paying for the food, I found the beef pad thai here to be alrightfor airport food. Conveniently located in the hub of all restaurants, this place is pretty easy to find within Toronto airport.

Before you step up to order and pay, make sure to see which cash register is active and working. I stood there for awhile confused at where to pay since the people around me didn't have any clue. Finally, I found someone who had already paid and she kindly directed me to pay at a different register that was across from the place.

Prices are a bit high, with majority of the items near $10 and the portions are so so. For the beef pad thai, it definitely was a bit saltier than what I'm used to but at the very least, it had flavor.

Would I stop by here again for food? Probably not since there are more food places in the area that seem to have better service and a short waiting time."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest, least customer centric Thai Express I've ever been to. The cashier and the cook clearly didn't want to be there. They seem so depressed. The cashier wasn't exactly friendly either. \"What do you want?... You're paying debit...\". Very unenthusiastically. We waited more than 10 minutes from our food, which was sloppily put into a box and given to us. No \"thank you\", no \"please come again\".... What a depressing hole. I won't be back here anytime soon. Don't bother coming here. Might as well go to McDonalds. At least people are more friendly there."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Thai fried rice but 2 stars for the service. 
The server are kinda rude sometime whenever I came here. I came 10 minutes before the closing time but they wanted to close asap so they yelled \"We closed\" to me. They could have just told me instead of giving me that attitude. And most of the time, the cook guy always stared at me with one eye and kinda threw the takeout box to me when they gave it to me. 
I honestly love the food here among other places in York Lane but their service is very bad. I revisited sometime only night time when I needed a quick dinner. In general, I would not really want to go here, however."}
{"text":"I had a Tom Yum soup with shrimp. There's a significant surcharge for shrimp compared to beef, chick, and tofu. However, I counted exactly 5 shrimps in total!!! 

They use a plastic bowl, which seemed volatile at times and substantially cheapened the experience. Plastic bowls come with plastic spoons. Tiny ones with tiny handles. Due to the exceptionally high food to spoon size ratio, it took a very long time to finish the soup. Much longer than I had allocated for lunch.  

Aside from the technical grievances mentioned above, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular. Seeing how it is located in Hillcrest mall, I'd say it's worth a look."}
{"text":"Recently opened and armed with a coupon I decided to give Thai Express a try. The place is cute, colorful and clean. You can see how clean through the open kitchen.   The food was good and I can see going back for a quick take out. My Pad Thai was good but next time I'll order with more vegetables."}
{"text":"2 hours to get your food delivered! I first called them to complain 1 hour after we didn't receive the food. They proceeded to tell us that it was taking some time because they did not have what we wanted readily available but they're almost done and on their way. 20 minutes later they called to say everything was done and the chauffeur was almost there. As a way to make it to me They gave me free spring rolls... I appreciated the call and proceeded to wait... 25 minutes later still no news... We then called then and... they were not picking up... we called them 3 times, no answer! We then called Just Eat to cancel the order... Just Eat (and this is a process they should amend) tried to call the restaurant with no success and then kept us on a 3-way call while trying to reach the owner on his cell phone. The owner who was not there called the restaurant guys on and after talking to them he said they told him I was okay with the delay, that they said they'd give me 10% off and... the reason for the delay was the roads were blocked!! He didn't even know I live downtown 15 min away from the restaurant by car... I vehemently asked for my money back and hope never to deal with this sort of service again."}
{"text":"My family and I received coupons in the mail to come here, and being avid fans of thai food, we were elated to have a thai place open up so close to us. Upon first entering, the place smells aggressively of fish sauce-- while obviously a good sign for seasoning, it's not the most pleasant aroma to be standing in for 45 minutes. We all ordered, and they were gracious enough to let us make several purchases in order to fully use the coupons. The food itself was mediocre at best. I ordered fried dumplings, which they serve in a plastic container with a closed lid; I'd assume most people know this would create steam and immediately make the dumplings soggy. Their spring roll was not only 99% lettuce, but it sits in a display for so long that by the time you try to eat it, the plastic has molded to the rice paper and it all falls apart. Additionally, despite being the only customers in the restaurant, they forgot to make 2/5 of our orders. The manager had even come to check on us several times and told us \"it's weird that your food isn't ready yet,\" even while the cooks were literally sitting at a table on their phones. It took both my dad and myself going over to ask about the food for them to figure out that it hadn't been prepared yet. The manager herself was charming, the only reason I give this review two stars is mostly for her service, although I would have appreciated some sort of compensation for waiting 25 minutes for my food other than \"oh man I'm so sorry. That sucks.\" The owner was literally sitting 2 tables away from us and seemed unconcerned and unbothered. Lastly-- there's no soy sauce available, or even salt for that matter, which would have made the world of difference between the bland pad thai that was not worth the wait vs a potential 3 star review. 
In short: while this place has plenty of potential, they have a long ways to go before they'll be a top contender for decent and professional Asian food in the Green Valley area-- both in terms of flavor and service. One star goes to the charismatic manager, the other goes to their HD television playing Planet Earth."}
{"text":"If you adopt the franchises' open concept kitchen you better also adopt how they maintain the kitchen's hygiene. The hygiene at this location is really bad that after watching them prepare and cook my food I lost my appetite already. Please! Thai express! Monitor your store!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered pad see ew and received noodles swimming in soy sauce with few shrimps with no taste but salt from the sauce.  Food completely uneatble ended up in the bin just like my $12 paid for that 'thai' meal. Service was rude, cooks were shouting something without any sense and not clear to whom, complete mess and awful food."}
{"text":"Great location, very clean. And that's the end of the compliments. Nearly flavourless General Thai Beef, with dry rice and tinned meatball style beef. Tom Yum soup with shrimp was lacking in flavour as well even though  I ordered spicy. And not good value either."}

I love Thai food but when we were ordering our food, the guy at cashier counter said he can make everything vegetarian which was actually also mentioned on there menu but then we noted he mentioning to the cook to make us the food and the cook denied as the noodles were already cooked in chicken broth. We weren't able to understand their communication as they were speaking in foreign language but I was able to get their cues when the cashier insisted us to pay and the cook was saying he can't do it. We finally asked the cashier that what is happening and he still said nothing but to be honest the cook was being honest."}

{"text":"DO YOU EVER EAT YOUR FEELINGS?  SOMETIMES I NEED TO EAT MY FEELINGS

And when I do, a Pad Thai from Thai Express will typically do the trick.  This location opened up last year and has been on wheels ever since.  Their cashier is quick, efficient and gets you through in no time.  Grab some chop sticks, some peanuts and you're laughin.  They will whip up all this msg goodness right in front of your eyes!

Wait MSG is bad?  Oh, yeah, some of their products MAY have MSG they warn.  So, that's not good I don't think.  Well, don't think about that part.

Their Tom Yum is extremely good as well but will run you about 10 bucks with coconut milk in it, and that's without a drink.  The pad thai will also run you about 8-10 dollhairs.  They offer combos with their menu items such as a medium pop and a spring roll.  Super greasy.  It's Grease LIGHTNIN!  And if you get it to go they come in little take out boxes.  Take out boxes are so hot right now.  No really, it's burning my hand off.

One of my beefs with Thai Express was they never had nutrition information available online.  You know, because when I'm eating my feelings I need to know I'm not adding diabetes to the list.  This new website they have www.thaiexpress.ca mentions they will have some available shortly.  Until then, mystery food.

Make sure you get there before 12:00/12:30 or you're a dead man.  You'll have to call in late to the boss.  Late and chock full of comforty goodness.

{"text":"What an awesome find! Not super authentic Thai food, but it definitely satisfies my Thai food cravings! Thai fast food at its finest. This place has a cool vibe to it too the moment you walk in. Modern, trendy and chic.  The yellow curry with chicken and pad Thai with shrimp was super yummy!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Thai Beef and Chicken, get ready, in the form of securing your shock absorbing jet pack straps as your seat belt, because it will be a roller coaster of flavor. Just a recommendation to include a fair warning, but please do train your body for the G-forces of flavor that you will experience due to the quality of the rice noodles here as well. I hope this place becomes a chain not only in this state."}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike this place because they consistently get my order wrong, the line is extremely long, and it's westernized Thai food. It's one of the 4 food options at the food court in the Southcore Financial Centre. I've had a few different dishes here, but the only one that keeps me coming back on the rare occasion is the fried rice. I usually order it with chicken. Once I ordered it with shrimp (a more expensive protein) and still received chicken. The food is placed in Chinese takeout containers. The rice packs in really well so you get about 2 large dishes worth of food. Overall, it's a pretty good value."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite food court places to eat at. They have decent pho and the pad Thai is tasty as well.

A little pricy for Thai food in a food court but still yummy to eat."}
{"text":"Neither better,  cheaper, nor faster than any of a dozen real Thai places in town. Pad Thai had zero flavor or heat. Overpriced Spring Roll that was 90% lettuce and bean sprouts. 

If you want Thai food, eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awful is what I can say with my pad Thai. If you had authentic pad thai you can definitely tell the difference. Beef was very tough and the taste was bland. 

Sorry to say but this place will eventually close down soon.

Only good thing was the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"First time visit and let me say that I will be back. Staff was friendly and service was amazing. Food was even better! Express says it all, stoped in for lunch and food was at the table as I sitting down from getting my drink. The store General Manager Ron was there to ensure everything was great and to make sure his customers and staff were taken care of.  Bottom line is if you want great food, great price, great service and a spotless place to eat I definitely recommend this place. The only down fall about the visit was the parking but a little walk is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good place for Thai fast food. Nice to have a sushi shop just beside in case the family have different tastes. Nice interior deco."}
{"text":"Let me add to the chorus of bad reviews as I eat my pad thai. Stopped in for late lunch as I was starving and wanted a fast thai fix.

Pad thai was barely passable, lacks any colour or vegetables aside from bean sprouts (menu board pic has peas... no peas given) entire plate of food just drenched in sauce. On the plus side there was an acceptable amount of chicken compared to other reviews.

As another review noted the self serve sauces were a sad sight. Bottles filthy and mostly empty... probably the same way since last reviewer's comments! The fountain pop was out of order.

Lone staff member looks ready to end it all. I get it that this isn't a dream job but at least pretend to be interested in the food you're serving me. Large TV screen mounted on wall, plastic still on it, coldy turned off, no entertainment or news while you eat your food in this depressing, spacious, dead dining room.

Everything about this place screams disappointment."}
{"text":"The express restaurant is a bit noisy. It's a simple menu that is convenient. The food was fast and flavorful. I had the chicken pad see ew. It was ok. The chicken was a bit dry but doust it with siraichi and it was great. It was clean and the seating is somewhat comfortable. I would like to try it again but maybe a different dish."}
{"text":"The owner is very very nice! The staff is very very green!!! The food is fresh and real which is nice. When I went it wasn't busy at all but the staff seemed to be having a super hard time getting it together. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp which came out pretty and it smelled really really good. The first bite was really great and enjoyable and every bite after was good until I got to the shrimp which was cold! Like really really cold and not cooked. I did continue to eat because I just didn't want to bother with complaining their new and they will get it together they just need practice. The owner came around asking how people liked their meals so I decided to tell him about the shrimp and he was shocked and so apologetic. He offered me a salad to make up for the shrimp but I already ate the meal and I was full and mistakes happen. I just appreciated him trying to make it better. I'm going to give them a few more weeks of being open then I will try them again because really the food was really good."}
{"text":"Asked for a spicy soup and it had literally no spice. It was super bland and boring, and in no way worth the $10 just for a bland veg soup. When I got up to get some sauce from the corner, they threw my stuff away. What a garbage experience."}
{"text":"I love that Thai express offers vegan options! They are very accommodating and very friendly. The food is always hot, fresh and made to order. 
It's fairly close to work, so it's a go to when feeling for something warm and filling. It's also nice that there are other restaurants close by (me va me, south st burger, chat time, aroma)"}
{"text":"I try to avoid the food court where possible, but there are some decent options to be had. Thai Express is just what you'd expect - fast (if you get there at 11.30 before the line starts), and, well, Thai... the offering includes noodles, rice, soups and something akin to a spring roll temptingly named the Imperial Roll.

I had the chicken fried basil rice. A good size, it filled me up and kept me happy on a cold day when I needed something that qualifies as a once a week treat only.

If you're in the hood, give it a go - but get their pre or post the lunch rush. Even though they are fast, there are a LOT of people in line for their delicious noodles..."}
{"text":"I frequent LVAC so I decided to try out the new Thia restaurant near by. With its recent opening everything is new and clean. Staff is also trying very hard to accommodate everyone as in this day and age of online posts it can make or break a new restaurant opening. 
The menu needs to be studied a bit if you're new as its a 3 or 4 step proces.  But once you understand how it works its really easy.
Overall it has the same appeal as a Pei Wei in the way you order and partially self serve. 
The price is very reasonable for what you get and I'll be back to sample other dishes."}
{"text":"Good ol' thai express. This food court option has creeped up on us over the years and now quite readily available at number of malls. It even has a joint venture along yonge street with another Mediterranean option, Villa Madina.

My first experience with them was at Yorkdale and I wasn't blown away by them.  I mean it wasn't bad at all. I guess my expectations were wayyy too high as my fellow coworker couldn't stop raving about it and pretty much pushed everyone around his cubic to go.  The conversation went like this:

Him: Do you like thai food?
Me: Yeah of course.
Him: No no, I'm saying do you really like thai food?
Me: ..... wherrreee you going with this?
Him: DUDEEE, Thai Express at Yorkdale.  It's new! Trust me it's awesome.
Me: ..... food court eh??
Him: DONE, we're going there for lunch.


Now I drop by the Eaton Centre locations more often than not and the line-ups at lunch can be horrible, almost not even worth it.  My usually choice whenever I go is the beef pad thai. Now though it's fast food and it's a food court option, they do make your food fresh. Right on the spot. So though the line ups are brutal at lunch and you have to wait for your food, you're getting a pretty fresh meal made right when you order.  The pad thai is my favourite choice when I stop by thai express. It's a little sweeter than most pad thai's I've had but the taste is something I just enjoy. Maybe even grown to enjoy with my number of visits.

Overall, I do like thai express. The only real complaints are that they don't publish the nutritional value of their menu and just how quickly they have increased their price as their popularity soared. So though a little more expensive amongst food court choices for lunch, I still find myself lining up for more."}
{"text":"I go there from time to time and I used to go to thai express in other cities too, and it is not as bad as the dating reviews on here state. I always recieved a decent service and the food always taste good! You do have to ask for most of the options (like spicy etc) even where there isn't a long line and they are not very generous on veggies (but yeah, it is fast food so I am not being too picky on this). Great for a filling meal after a long day of class!"}
{"text":"Great for Thai food on the go, not amazing but in a sea of burger joints and fast food garbage its nice to have a healthy options in this area. Great for a quick bite when coming to the Aviva Centre for the Canada Masters or other events held on York's campus."}
{"text":"This is probably the poorest quality Thai Express that I have experienced. 
I ordered a chicken curry of which when I got home had no chicken. I paid $11 for rice and a few bamboo shoots and sliver of green pepper- when I asked for only a little rice.
By time I got home the resto was closed- I plan to call tomorrow - very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place after my workout at Lvac. Got the red curry and a steamed chicken appetizer. The curry I ordered spicy and to go. I wasn't a fan that they mixed it up with the rice and there was barely any chicken in it and for it being spicy I would say it was maybe a 5 on a 10 scale. The appetizer was ok -- not horrible but nothing memorable. I wouldn't go back but great if you want something quick."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the shrimp PAD Thai and for some reason the shrimp still had the skin on. I've eaten shrimp pad Thai from different palaces and never had the shrimp with skin on. It was weird but the food was good over all. PLS TAKE THE SKIN OFF THE SHRIMP"}
{"text":"The more Yelp reviews I write, the more I am discovering my star-rating system is more methodic than I initially thought.

For example: How could I possibly give a Thai-fast-food place like \"Thai Express\" 5 stars, and only give something like ... say ... FARM, 3 stars??

I am finding that as I rate places, the stars I give them are based on how I feel they satisfy the customer by accomplishing what they are \"setting out to do.\"

And Thai Express does exactly that.

I return time and time again because, for a fair price, Thai Express makes (what seems to be) nearly authentic Thai food right before your eyes.

Yes, it is in a mall food court.

Yes, it is a chain.

And yes ... it is delicious.

I almost always get the Pad Sew, but I have tried many other things as well and it is all very good.

If for nothing else, visit this food court chain to see the skill of a Master as he prepares your food in a fast moving wok over of a small volcano of fire.
This is no teenager flipping burgers."}
{"text":"I don't even remember the last time I ate from Thai Express. During this visit I was just picking up some take-out for my sister. I arrived around 5 pm to order a chicken pad thai to go. I actually didn't get to order for at least 10 minutes because there was only one person working there. The man there was actually the cashier and cook. This is why I gave them a pretty low rating. Other than that I don't really have anything else to say since I didn't eat anything from Thai Express."}
{"text":"For months and months we waited for this place to open and we were so excited to have a Thai option at the food court. What a big disappointment today! They didn't have anymore shrimp spring rolls to begin with. We ordered their pad tai with a hot spice level. We also got the general Thai chicken. The food came out piping hot because it was made fresh to order. The pad Thai did not taste like pad Thai and they used way too much fish sauce. The noodles were even different than the typical pad Thai noodles. The general Thai chicken looked good but it was like a blander version of Panda's orange chicken. Overall I didn't think the food was worth the money and probably won't be back. Also, spicy was not spicy :("}
{"text":"It's okay, I mean they give you a ton of noodles but there isn't much protein to go with it. Also, the dry noodles were quite salty. $10 for a regular bowl seems a bit on the expensive side but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad prik pao. It looked fantastic in the poster; chunks of chicken with a good balance of sauce to go with it. What I got was nothing close to that poster. The chicken was sliced and barely there. I maybe got 5 okay sized pieces. This is a personal preference but I don't like cilantro, parsley or green onions and there was an abundance of it. 

Overall; definitely not worth the almost $9.50 that was spent. Will I go back and try something else? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Service is quick and nothing notable or unnotable. 

However, food was just SO terrible. I ordered the pad see ew with beef, and while the portion was okay, it tasted nothing like anything I've had before. Yes, this is a fast chain, and I've eaten at other locations of the same chain but they were good enough for fast Thai. But this was just plain horrible. It was something like a true fail, something bad between Chinese and Thai food - and I love both cuisines. It didn't taste like anything other than what I assume to be the oil they cook the food in. Okay one star though, because it was piping hot fresh, and the noodles' texture was nice. I mean really.. I'm sure there is a recipe you need to follow for sauces especially right? At a chain?? 

I tried to finish it since I don't like to waste food or money, but this had to go in the trash for me."}
{"text":"Really hard working staff making very sub standard food. Thai express needs to up their game. This food doesn't represent Thai food. It's just a sad waste of time."}
{"text":"Don't expect your meal to look anything like the pictures, VERY skimpy on the vegetables!  I had the General curry on rice, breaded chicken was good, medium spice very flavourful, but few carrot pieces, some onions, green peppers, pineapple pieces, and potatoes?!?  Yeesh...ate in but was given styrofoam dishes and plastic cutlery.  Styrofoam, really?!?"}
{"text":"Thai Express just opened in my work building yesterday.  There was a massive lineup and many co-workers told me it was great.  Grabbed an early lunch today and opted for the Eggplant Chicken on Steamed Rice.... 9.36 with taxes. 
Service was friendly, portion is larger than it looks in the cool little box.  But I want more chicken!!  Veggies were plenty, but I need more protein.  Taste was okay, nothing to blow my socks away.  
Wasn't impressed, wasn't too disappointed either.  Just meh... filled me up.  Did the job.  I probably will not be going back unless I am in a bind with no other choices.  
So.... meh.. not bad."}
{"text":"So I just stopped for dinner at the Thai Express. Looks like the place is only been open for a week or so so they may be getting their legs for whatever it takes to run this place. There seem to be more people behind the counter then there were in the audience outside, that means us customers. There were three walks that were cooking away with flames flying high it was impressive show that's for sure. The menu is quite compact and I had some stir-fried vegetables and I ordered them medium hot. Well for those of you who don't like hot you might want to be careful because they're medium is equal to a medium Plus for most people maybe even a hot for some for me it was okay but just to be where if it's your first pass start with mild and work your way up. There was nothing spectacular about the flavors. Things were flavorful and portions were small, overall the meal was fine. Thank you Thai  express"}
{"text":"As food court restaurants go, this one is my favourite. I don't come here that often, but out of all the options this one is the tastiest and most consistent in terms of food and service. Plus, who doesn't want to watch their food being cooked in a flaming wok?!

I generally get the pad sew, it's pretty great. Flavourful and smells wonderful. I usually end up eating it too quickly and choke because it's so good and because I'm shovelling it into my mouth like an anime character.

I've also had the pad thai in the past. It's pretty great too. I actually think they put msg or whatever Tim Hortons uses to keep you coming back. I think I bought 2-3 orders of it? So I could have some the next day at work and for dinner. It's seriously addictive stuff.

The only negative I have is the beef. It's dry and it's also consistent in dryness. So order chicken or shrimp, those are good. Even tofu or vegetables beats that beef. Haven't had the fish out of allergies.

All in all, it's a great choice in that food court."}
{"text":"Went there today for some soup. It was just blahh! Not much flavor to it. Plus I think the guy should've asked me at least what size I want. He didn't even tell me that there are two sizes. I guess he just wanted to make a sale for higher amount. The quantity was huge. I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"This little place has some of the best Thai food I have ever had. The food is made with all natural and fresh ingredients and their spring rolls are the best I ever had... pretty reasonable prices too! I so recommend this place!"}
