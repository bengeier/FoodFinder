{"text":"Small mom n pop shop who I would like to give 4 stars in order to support their business which serves homemade Colombian and Argentinian food. I tried their Argentenian beef empanadas and chicken empanadas as well as their Colombian tamale. I stumbled upon this place as I was walking to my car. The stores and restaurants in this area are primarily Korean, so I was surprise to see a Latin spot in between them. The woman behind the counter, I assume was the owner, Maria. I did not ask. Even though she spoke primarily Spanish, she was able to communicate in English. It just took her longer to get her point across, the food is outstanding, I am particularly fond of the Argentinian beef empanadas vs the chicken. At 3 bucks each, I would say, that's a good deal! The chicken empanadas was a bit drier, hitch is why I prefer the beef. the tamales are excellent in which, for 8 bucks, wasn't bad, since they're a huge portion! I would like to try their other food if I get a chance to visit them again. Nice customer service and explanation of the dishes that I had questions about. Very friendly owners. Gracias!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and empanadas are very good, Colombian tamales good as well.  They have special food on weekends I did try the ajiaco soup and omg !!!  Small and cozy.  Ohh the Colombian coffee is superb !!!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this cafe when walking along what is known as \"Koreatown\" and we decided to go in to investigate.  The people behind the counter were super friendly, and the cafe was clean and welcoming.

As we hadn't planned to eat, we ordered a cheese arepa and a cubano sandwich to go.  For the Cheese Arepa, there is a choice of sweet corn, or regular;  we chose the sweet corn.  Total order for this take-out was around $15 (think there may have been a small upcharge for the sweet corn).

The food took around 10 minutes to prepare, and during that time, we explored the shelves of latin groceries available.  I think prices may be a tiny bit higher than stores in Kensington market, but understandably, rent is probably higher on Bloor W.

Especially since we didn't eat the food right away, I'm happy to report that everything was delicious.  The servings were generous, and importantly, tasty.  There will be future visits to dine-in, to try the ceviches and their tamales.  This place was a nice surprising find in Koreatown."}
{"text":"A really really nice place. 
The couple owners are friendly and welcoming. They are always smiling and try to serve you in the best way.
Free wifi.
Clean bright environment. Seems like a popular local spot for Columbia people.
Cozy chairs, really comfortable.
Big, clean washrooms.
I ordered ham&cheese sandwich. Way better than I expected. It is crispy outside, but not overcooked. 
Still hot when I got it. 
The only problem is it is kind of cold in winter.
And a little noisy for people like me who want to work."}
{"text":"I love this quaint little cafe in the middle of Korea town. Previously knowing very little about Latino flavours, the friendly owner of this place, Aland and Maria, introduced me to the snacks and food that I would otherwise never know existed.  There is regularly a rotation of some photos and paintings on the wall depicting the life and scenery of Columbia. Never been to Columbia, this place is the proxy that helps me imagine being there.

There is an awesomely exotic collection of grocery items like queso fresca (cheese), traditional fruit paste made of guava, Columbian cacao beverage (Corona). They seem to update their selection frequently. I discover new things to try every time I visit this place.

This is becoming my favorite place for a casual lunch whenever I come to Koreatown for grocery or errand run on the weekend. I love the a la carte way of ordering because each menu item comes in smaller portion and lower unit price so I can order as my appetite sees fit. In other word, this is very similar to the dim sum experience - perfect for me who is a bit ADD when it comes to eating.

The beef empanadas is a must-have on my every visit. If I am very hungry, the tamales, being filling and very delicious in its exotic way,  would be my top choice."}
{"text":"This place just opened right in my neighbourhood a couple of months ago but I didn't go there until this week.  My boyfriend and I stopped by yesterday and he got a fantastic sandwich.  Then today we returned for Colombian coffee (strong, delicious, and great price) and alfajore cookies (very yummy).  Now I definitely want to try their other food, like the Cuban sandwich.  Also, it's really clean and has a beautiful ambiance, with tables to sit down and have your coffee."}
{"text":"Check out this new Latin American cafe and grocery store in Koreatown, one of my favourite evolving strips in our city. Apparently the owner is behind Ceviche 707 (of the Market 707) at the terrific community hub, Scadding Court. 

His new venture is bright and pretty and there are tons of offerings either to take away or to sit and enjoy. I just stopped in for a quick veggie tamale, but I'll be back sometime soon to sample some more substantial savory treats (e.g. arepa, cuban sandwich, ceviche) or sweets (e.g. some fresh Colombian coffee with Argentine style alfajores). 

The juices also sound tempting and include: sour sop, passion fruit, pink guava, bloody blackberry or lull (Guanabana, maracuya, guayaba, mora o lull). Can't wait to sip some sunshine at Ave Maria!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Ave Maria recently since we were in the area to go to Honest Ed's to soak in the nostalgia one last time before they close down for good at the end of the year. Ave Maria is a caf√© and a small Latin grocery/convenience store. These kind of places always have character and always draw me in. 

The place is super cute with paper taped on the walls with words and short phrases in English and how to say them in Spanish. 

They serve arepas, sandwiches and empanadas (they also had samosas, which I thought was a little unusual...). They also had coffee and other beverages.

My husband and I shared 3 empanadas ($3 each). They have a deal where if you buy 3 empanadas you get a free Columbian coffee. We got a beef, chicken and vegetarian (which was spinach and feta cheese). 

I felt that the empanadas were ok, but to me they tasted exactly like the ones I get at The Real Canadian Superstore in Ottawa for $2 each (or $1 when on sale). They were pretty small too. I'm by no means an empanada connoisseur, but my favourite empanadas are from La Chilenita in Montreal. In Toronto, my favourite are from Jumbo Empanada in Kensington Market. And in Ottawa, where there is a paucity of South American restaurants, my favourite empanadas are from the Real Canadian Superstore! So take these comments as you will.

Staff at Ave Maria were super nice and welcoming. The place is cute and cozy. 

I would come back to try other items. Maybe even their Columbian empanadas, which are a different style."}
{"text":"Best Colombian beef and potato empanadas I have ever had! The veggie are good to! The menu looks delicious but I keep getting empanadas! Very friendly and they also have a mini market section of Colombian/ Latin foods!"}
{"text":"Went here because I was craving arepas and they didn't disappoint! The food was delicious though there weren't very big portions for the price, which is why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars. 

There is a small amount of space so definitely can eat in here if you're a smaller group. I wouldn't recommend big groups, though. 

I'll definitely come back if I'm craving Arepas again. There's also Arepa Cafe on queen for Venezuelan Arepas."}
{"text":"That columbian coffee! If this place opens at U of T campus Starbucks coffee would be out of business. Be warned: the hot sauce is HOT"}
{"text":"well I went in to have their tres leches cake.  it was good...sweet but very good.  I've tried a few of these at other places as I was trying to figure out what the fuss was about and every time I didn't find it appealing ...but here...it's good...still a bit sweet for me...but one of the best ones I've  had and it's homemade !  now i have to go back to try the food LOL"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Run by real people. Recommend the arepas and ceviche."}
{"text":"A girl named Maria owns it. I would love to Ave Maria, but she's already married and I stopped having affairs with married people years ago due to death threats.

What to get: The sausage omgzzzzz.
What else: The guava drink is special

There's a bit of a wait here, but my goodness is it worth it. Easily one of the best meals I've ever had in Canada, eh. This is Venezuelan food, and is closer to street food than fancy food. The prices are not bad at all, and one of their heavenly Chorizo sausages with the bits of arepa and amazing sauce slathered all over it will fill you up for under ten Canadian.

Then you just need to order their incredible authentic Jugos on the side, which are blended fruit drinks - I get mine without milk but it's up to you. The Guava is off-the-charts perfect. I can't speak to the others but I bet they are amazing too.

Lovely service, a nice family-owned place with all kinds of Venezuelan delights that will thrill you as much as it will satisfy your hunger. Anyone who lives in or visits Toronto and hasn't been here, has really been missing out.

...

Sorry I had to go and Latin the cat. He was scratching at the door.

Anyway, give this sausage and guava drink a try, and you will be sure to Ave a lovely meal. If that sausage were a girl, I'd Maria. Well assuming she said yes when I proposed to her. And if the sausage were a guy, well... yeah."}
{"text":"The interior is a small little grocery store with a counter where you can place your order for cooked goods. 

2/5 Passionfruit juice (~$4.50) - was claimed to be made fresh. I did hear the blender go off. It didn't have the seeds or pulp in it, and it tasted like the VITA juicebox version. Not worth the money!

4/5 Chicken Tamale - chicken, pork, in potatoes, peas, corn, wrapped in a banana leaf
Get this, aside from the peas being an over-steamed unhealthy green, everything was flavoured with what seemed like a chicken stock. The meat fell of the bone and was tender. The corn flour is really good. It comes with hot sauce on the side which tastes good too :)"}
{"text":"The closest thing to actually being in Medellin in Toronto. The food is good - both to take home as groceries, and to dine-in. The staff is also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe, I am Latin and is the first time I feel so welcome in a place like this, so clean and nice, perfect place to have a nice coffee or a snack. The owners are amazing people, really friendly and kind and they go above and beyond to help. It was my first time there and they were so nice explaining everything. I love it. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"The best iced coffee I've ever had in Toronto! They freeze coffee into iced cubes so it feels like a bottomless cup even if you take it to go. My boyfriend and I stop in a couple times during the week and it's always a pleasure to chat with the owners and try something new. There are also numerous vegetarian options on the menu, from tamales, empanadas and arepas. Ave Maria is one of my favourite spots on bloor for its relaxed, family-oriented vibe to its delicious columbian food.

They also have a small grocery store at the front where you can stalk up on guava candies, various snacks and cooking essentials and more."}
{"text":"I discovered this place walking up on Bloor St during Open Streets TO before meeting up a friend for the Folk Festival on Christie Pitts park.

I ordered the arepas because I love the Venezuelan street food. The Colombian version of the dish is too bland for me. It was a bland corn tortilla barely toasted with cheese inside. 

I was reminded how tamales may taste differently between Nicaraguan, El Salvadorian and Mexican; how bar-b-que can taste differently in Toronto and the South (I don't know enough of this cuisine to describe it more). Just because I didn't like Colombian arepas, doesn't make them less of a dish. It is still a Colombian traditional dish. Just like for some, \"x\" tamales may be tastier and more flavourful than 'y' tamales. 

I don't think I would return to this store, but if you are in the search for yerba mate, flour, coffee, this hospital white, innocuous cafe is your place outside of the usual suspect, Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Cute ma and pa shop with yummy empanadas and even yummier hot sauce. Great hospitality and a good place to catch up with a friend or a good study space alternative to Starbucks.

Caution: do not expect a quiet space, medium background noise and awesome Latin music."}
{"text":"Great place to get some work done with a side of legit Columbian coffee! Smaller place, but I like the atmosphere much better than crowded Starbucks. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the best Latin spot in The Annex. 

Must Try Items:
Their iced coffee is amazing (only place ive ever seen use actual coffee ice cubes!!) 
You can't go wrong with the Empanadas (the Argentinian chicken is fabulous).
As well as the Arepa Chocolo (sweet corn and cheese) and Tamale Salvador?no. 
If you're in the mood for something heavier but equally tasty, try the Cuban Sandwich. 

The owners are very friendly and hospitable and have an interesting story if you want to have a chat with your meal."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Chef Aland and Maria's Latin cooking ever since they were at Market 707. Their cooking is simple and delicious, just like a home cooked meal. Being in their own cafe has let them really expand their Latin fare, including empanadas (which I always have), ceviche and tamales. The arepas with choice filling of queso fresco (fresh cheese), chorizo, and pulled pork (which I had today) are lovingly prepared. Nothing on the menu is more than $10.

The best kept secret might be the Colombian coffee (sourced from a local roaster) and a beef empanada as an afternoon snack, or the homemade alfajores if you want something sweet. You can also buy Colombian groceries there as well.

Be sure to stay and have a nice chat with Aland and Maria - they are both very friendly!"}
{"text":"I read about this place in a blog and I am so happy that I did. I was even more happy that I visited this place!

Service: The owners are very friendly. They welcome you as soon as you enter. Just what you would expect when you visit a cool place like this one.

Food: During this visit, I ordered a juice( that is sour, but also naturally a bit sweet) for $4.50. It was delicious!  

I also purchased two packets of Colombian wafers with coconut ($1 each).  Once you open the package, you can't stop eating it! 

One of the owners, Maria, explained to me all types of juices since some of the names were not familiar to me. I just can't recall the name of the juice that I ordered...!


If you are near Christie station, I highly recommend you to check it out."}
{"text":"Rating is based primarily on the Columbian tamale which was part of the $13 combo that came with an empanada + drink of your choice (from fridge).

Empanada - The beef one with the corn shell was GOOD!  Definitely have it with the salsa that they provide.  If the empanadas are $3ea, as per other reviews, it was on the smaller side.  It's smaller than a beef patty.

Columbian tamale - this one had both beef/chicken in it.  This was pretty bland.  The masa had no distinct corn flavour and the meat lacked seasoning.  I honestly think it boils down to the masa.  I love tamales, so I was a bit disappointed with this one!

At $13, it's shareable between 2 people if both of you aren't hungry.  If 1 person eats this, you'll be satisfied.  

I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but to try other items like the iced coffee!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Only place in the city that actually has ice cubes made of coffee for iced coffee and the coffee is astounding here. I get grounded fresh Colombian beans that are roasted in Canada here and they are astounding. Also try the variety of yummy Latin inspired treats ( veggie arepa is great!) and stuff for the house like tostadas caseras!"}
{"text":"The empanadas are wonderful and are served by a kind and courteous owner. Great coffee too - small, medium or large, all the same price!"}
