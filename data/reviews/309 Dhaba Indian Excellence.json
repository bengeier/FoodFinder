{"text":"Dhaba was probably the only Indian restaurant that was open past 10 pm in the downtown area - so for that we were grateful.  The food was ok but not \"omg! This is so awesome!\".  It was late so I think we got lucky with street parking, but that could be an issue if you came at regular hours."}
{"text":"We went for weekend buffet brunch. DÃ©cor was comfortable, quiet and spacious - calming.  I tried a bit of everything and my favorite items were butter chicken, rosemary potatoes, vegetable pakora, cooked eggplant, green salad with big white shrimp. The tandoori chicken was ok. Goat, ok. Not sure they if they had 70 items as they had many unidentified condiment/sauce containers. Dessert was fresh fruits (strawberries, pineapple, honey dew, cantaloupe, yellow plums) assorted self scoop ice cream, and three traditional indian dessert items (rice pudding, yellow starchy oily balls, and a ground almond flour(?) pudding). Had their mango lassi - good tasting smoothie made of mango and whipped milk. Would have liked pappadums and tandoori cauliflower."}
{"text":"Great location in the Theatre District.  I came here with a large party and had one of the most pleasurable meals I've ever had.  It was only my second time having Indian food out, and I thoroughly enjoyed the the ambiance, food, and cozy atmosphere.  I distinctly remember the service being impeccable.  The Naan was great, and I loved the Spinach Dahl.  I also tried goat here for the first time, and I distinctly remember nudging the person next to me asking them if they \"got their goat\" while cracking myself up with my hilarious and clever play on words.  I'm pretty sure it was the red wine talking.  Don't let my corny attempts of digging into my memory banks dissuade you.  Evidently the restaurant got a face lift and a makeover.  Not necessary in my book, this place was fantastic."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Ordered delivery...took 2.5 hours. Food arrived freezing cold and we each got horrible food poisoning the next morning.  Never again."}
{"text":"Bad service. Poor quality food.  Very slow.  Food was burnt... Horrible staff, very cranky servers..  Even getting a glass of water was a problem for the server.. The kitchen was in such a hurry to close at 10 pm, they actually threw away our 'food to go'.."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get and terrible delivery system... Flavor is just ok but not worth the bucks."}
{"text":"They size you based on the number of people and the tip to expect. I live nearby and walked in for dinner alone. Terrible service. Once I said I want to get a take out, even worse. Didn't fill my water, nothing. Highly unrecommended. If you must, just put a 50 in their face when you enter! :P"}
{"text":"Bad service! Called them twice they said it's a buffet, got there driving for one hour, they say no it's not. This the only restaurant open so you might as well eat here. We left as We didn't appreciate this customer gaining technique. Called them again to assure we went to the right one they lie again and say it's a buffet. On Yelp notes they say they have lunch and dinner buffet. Inconvenience! Liars! Bad service!"}
{"text":"Was there with a friend for a pre-theater dinner on a Wednesday night. Food was average to even below average, we ordered deven dishes and none of them was anything to rave about. If not for the attentive service, I would have given the place 2 stars...Waiters were working hard to make our dinner enjoyable but the place was only at third of the capacity, so they obviously were not busy. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is the third Indian buffet we have tried downtown Toronto, and while it is not the worst (that was Kama), it is certainly far from the best.  For the hot food section, I did not like the fact that I had to lift the clear plastic cover off every dish because it made my hands greasy.  Every item tasted just okay and some were too salty.  The naan was the worst out of the three places we've tried.  Not sure if it's because the turnover wasn't high, but the food definitely tasted like it's been sitting there for a while.    The samosa was nice and spicy.  It's hard to go wrong with deep fried carbs. The mango lassi was room temperature.  The desserts were a let down.  We tried every item and it was average.  Gulab jamun was too dense and too sweet.  The ice cream were mostly cheap and artificial flavours.  Rice pudding had little flavour."}
{"text":"I have not eaten a lot of Indian food, so I didn't know what to order. The chef actually prepared me a couple different dishes to try out.  Not sure what it was called - but was Lamb Chops - the best lamb I have had. Excellent. I also tried the house specialty of Butter Chicken - can't go wrong with that - but very rich!! I also had Chana Masala - not my favourite dish. But 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  The Naan bread was to die for, and the chef took me into the kitchen and showed me how it was made.  Great service. Great Food. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible Service.  We were late so we called and apologized and asked if we should still bother to come.  The person said that we could still come.  When we got there, the guy actually berated us for being late even though we had called before!  Then, he proceeded to be rude to us.  We asked for a particular table but the maitre d was reluctant to give it to us, even though the restaurant was almost empty.  We came close to leaving but decided to stay to avoid making it unpleasant for our children who were with us.  My husband, who had picked this restaurant to celebrate his birthday, asked for a recommendation at one point and the waiter said he could not say.  We shared two appetizers but the prawns and the kebabs were both overdone.  Our entrees were good but the naan was burnt to a crisp... and still served!  Needless to say, we would never go back."}
{"text":"Went there for a buffet lunch. The food was tasty , service was great, clean and friendly atmosphere- will definitely come back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed because we were lied to about ingredients and the service was terrible. My boyfriend and I are both vegan and tried this restaurant for takeout. We asked the servers about the ingredients of their vegetable samosas and naan bread. We were told they contained no egg/dairy.   When we called to order from here a few weeks later and asked again, they told us there was dairy in the naan. Very unprofessional, ethically wrong, and violating. Can't imagine what would happen if this happened to someone with an allergy. Would not recommend at all- there are much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Saag Paneer and Chana Masala within the group.  I tried everything and it tasted great and fresh. The channa was just the right firmness. The naan and the rotis were great too. The lemonade was not the greatest but I was too busy stuffing myself with all the food. Prices are a little bit on the higher end for an Indian restaurant but I guess you have to pay those prices on King Street."}
{"text":"Stepped in for a saturday lunch buffet. Well, for 12.99$ u definitely are eating way more than you have payed for ;)  We went in for the mango lassi as well as that was supposed to be half-priced that day. And wow , it was one of the best lassi's that i've ever had ! PERIOD. Food was good, not great. But definitely one of the better experiences from an indian restaurant so far."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE and BLOODY Shit restaurant I have ever seen.Servers were very rude specially the owner.They have no manners or no respect for customers.They treat them like a dog.Food was worst and below expectation.Spoiling the name of Indian food.  NEVER EVER Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Flavorful North Indian food!  We loved their fish curry, just the right amount of spice.   An extensive salad menu too!  Ask for Joe when you're here, he will take care of you!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery on a Tuesday at 7pm. my simple order (paneer, vindaloo, rice, naan) took an hour and 40 minutes. there was a piece of metal (a staple?) in my vindaloo. those stand out the most for me - other than that, the food was ok (the vindaloo wasn't extremely flavorful, the lamb was overdone). given the choice in indian restaurants in this neighborhood there's no reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"I'm not the most experienced when it comes to Indian, but I like what I've had so far.  I was out of town for work and luckily, my coworker fancies himself an expert.  He got a personal recommendation for Dhaba and I wasn't going to pass up the chance to get a \"real\" Indian experience.  We came for dinner and I didn't find street parking to be difficult, but maybe it was because we went on a random Tuesday night.  As others have suggested, just do that instead of paying an arm and a leg.  The restaurant entrance is kind of small, so you might miss it on the first pass.  Once we got there, I left all the ordering to my expert friend.  He ordered garlic naan (a must), lamb vindaloo (spicy!), butter chicken (my favorite dish of the night), chana masala, some kind of paneer, and some dessert.  Everything was good, but the butter chicken and naan were my favorites.  I could just order those and be set.  I didn't go with 5 stars because the paneer and masala didn't knock my socks off.  I'd definitely go again and experiment with some other dishes."}
{"text":"Aloo kerdchi maar ke, must try once at ......Dhaba restaurent!!!  I went dhaba to relish my choice of indian cousine yesterday.ordered aloo kerdchi maarke  with garlic naan.this dish is one of many specialities of dhaba,it was freshly prepared,gravy was too good and garlic naan were also fresh and soft.  I was served complimentry saffron rice which i tried for first time,were really cooked to taste.  Aloo kerdchi maarke is just beyond comparison.i just loved it,will surely recommend to all."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. I've been there several times, and the service is always excellent. My family uses it as a place to celebrate special events and milestones, so the last time I was there was for my mother's birthday. We let the servers know what time we had to be to a theatre by, and they were prompt with both service and the bill. The food is super-tasty, which is saying something for an Indian restaurant downtown (and I'm Indian, so I don't usually eat out for Indian food), and the location is great.   The restaurant has an extensive menu, the portions are a good size (not too big), and the flavours are AMAZING (almost as good as my mum's cooking). You definitely can't get Indian food anywhere close to this good, near by. There's a section for group seating further into the restaurant, and smaller four-seater tables in the front near the windows.  They also accommodate allergies, and have a corking fee that is reasonable if you have a special occasion and want to bring your own wine. All in all, my first choice for Indian food in Toronto. Other than my parents' house."}
{"text":"I order food regularly from just-eat.ca and decided to try a new Indian place for dinner last night.   Butter chicken, saag paneer, and samosas arrived in a timely manner (approx. 45 minutes) and handoff was quick.   Then the evening turned for the worse:  The (very small piece of) naan was shoved into a foil bag that clearly had been holding this piece of bread for way too long. It was very soggy and it was overloaded with butter. The pappadum, a nice gesture, was broken into small crumbs in a bag that was stapled to the rest of the bags.   Both my friend and I weren't feeling great around a half hour after we finished eating. And then I experienced the most horrific food poisoning of all time, which forced me to 1) leave work 2) work in my bathroom for the rest of the day.   I will never be ordering from here again! Beware if you're ordering take-out as you sometimes are just taking a big gamble."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Toronto. I always start with the full meat appetizer - this is a mini meal so make sure you have 3-4 people if you order it.   For entrees I've had the tikka masala, the okra, saag paneer, and tandoori chicken. All have been top notch.   The garlic naan is a nice touch too. The mango drink at the end of the meal is a nice way to finish depending how spicy your food was.   They do take out as well. Not sure of delivery."}
{"text":"I write this review with a heavy heart.  This restaurant has potential but no clue how to deal with service.  We were a party of eight and we spent about $800/- that night - about $100 a head.  Food was good.  Portions small.   But everything else did not work out and it was not a particularly busy Saturday night either. Service was extremely slow and spotty.  No one came round to check on whether we needed anything more.  I had to get up and seek wine glass changes each time.  We ordered wine, and trust me they could not produce the same wine brand at anytime.  We had to have three different brands of wine and our glasses were not even changed.  Altogether, the management needs to train their service staff better.  They were all very nice but that does not cut it when you are dropping a huge amount.  We were celebrating a bunch of things with our family and it was indeed disappointing.  I would really like to hear back from the Dhaba Toronto management."}
{"text":"My family and I took opportunity to visit Dahba for dinner. The food is very high quality, authentic and delicious. We ordered tandoori chicken, butter chicken and palak paneer. Everything that we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"I am shocked at what Dhaba has become.  This used to be my go to place in Toronto for food, but it isn't the same anymore.  I ate there last week and the service was deplorable. That is the best way to describe it.   The service was exceptionally slow given that only approximately 5 tables were seated the entire evening we were there.  I had to rudely request water as within half an hour of being seated, it wasn't poured.   The food was four stars, but with such horrendous service, I can only justify two stars.  To give you an idea of what it is now - there was a cardboard triangle ad on the table that was tacky.   As always I did the tasting menu, which was delicious. I just am shocked at the poor service.  I would suggest only going for the buffet from now on as you don't really need any sort of service then."}
{"text":"Naan good, service good, and I had someone playing instruments while I was there haha. The service was better than expected as well, proactive water refill, which is hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for noon on a Friday. Was asked for full name, phone number, etc.. Showed up at 12:05pm. Two people from my group were already there. They were waiting because they gave away my table. When I talked to someone he pointed to a table and told us to use it then walked away. There were no chairs at the table. So we grabbed chairs for an adjacent table. The staff came back and told us we could use those chairs. So I asked him which chairs we should use. He walked away. A few minutes later he came back with identical chairs and told us to use them. I pointed out he could just put the replacement chairs at the other table. So he did.  As for the food, it was meh. Most the dishes where sauce but not much in the way of meat chana or aloo. The restaurant opens at 11:30am and they were already running out of some dishes. There was only 3 pieces of naan. The chana masala seemed a little under cooked. The samosas seemed a little over cooked. After eating my first plate I went back for seconds. There was now plenty of naan but 3 of the dishes that came in a sauce were all sauce and only one or two pieces of meat in the entire warming tray.  I didn't realize it until later but there was no dessert section. I had been to this location a while ago and they had some ice cream and other things for dessert. I didn't see any of this anymore.  I don't remember the staff who took our order coming by to refill our water. When we were done and just waiting for the bill we had to get up and ask someone to give us our bill. As he was trying to find out bill in the computer the person who took our order came out and took over.  No one asked us if everything was okay. Getting someone's attention was so difficult and I didn't have time to find someone to complain that I just left. It feels like the place is under new management. I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for late a late night meal. The food blew our minds. It was absolutely amazing. Will definitely come here again. The staff was great too. Very tranquil atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst Indian food ever. I got butter chicken and samosa, the food was first of all late. The butter chicken sauce was not smooth it was lumpy and there was a layer of grease on the top of it and it did not even taste like any butter chicken that I've ever tasted. I was very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a medium-sized group.  I'm don't know authenticity of Indian food, but I've been to a few Indian restaurants.  The naan was great, main dishes were mainly pretty good.  Service was pretty awful though.  Nothing outright offensive, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.  It took half an hour after the first people were seated to get our glasses filled with water, and it wasn't like they were under-staffed.  The ladies' bathroom was not maintained, and the floors were super greasy.  The decor is alright, but it was too dim.  We ate moderately and the bill came to $30/person, after everything."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Every dish we ordered was a knock-out, and the service for our party of four (four adults and a spice-averse 5 year-old) was excellent.  We all agreed that Dhaba served one of the best Indian meals we'd ever had.  I didn't pay the bill that evening, so I can't recall the exact damage, but I think that it was slightly pricier than your average Indian meal out.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian  restaurant in downtown core.  Food is a little fusion. But the staff is very nice and courteous.   Though I must say, they are a bit packed and it is difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I don't often eat Indian food but I decided to try this place out. I ordered the Chicken Korma dish with naan bread. I had tried this dish in the past from a different place, and Dhaba had much more flavour to it. It was a delicious meal and really good for the price. I ordered off of Tasteaway and received 10% off my order because I went over $50.  I was able to make two meals out of the amount of food I got. I will be ordering here again the next time I crave some Indian food."}
{"text":"This was possible the worst Indian Buffet I've ever eaten at.  Firstly, they had more Canadian/American food then Indian Food.  Second, the Indian food they had, had no taste, bland and not even hot.  I'm Indian and I've eaten at many Indian establishments and this is the worst I've ever had.  Even the naan wasn't that good, it was stale.  On top of it the dessert was just pathetic, the ice cream was stale and had that ice cream freezer burn taste.  What was the worse thing is that we went their for a company lunch and more than half of us had stomach issues after eating the food.  Not worth the money, its cheap, but if you want real quality Indian food I would go down the street to Aroma or go to the Host."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience immensely. Greeted at the front door (very welcoming) and had no problems confirming our third party reservation. Were seated within 5 minutes.  Service was top notch. We chose a Valentines Day Special that provided a full course meal for each. Great combination of foods. Excellent value for money.  Although busy, we were not rushed.  Recommended. ***Jeff***"}
{"text":"One of several Indian restaurants within a couple of blocks, I picked it on a whim. I could sum up my experience as: great food, poor service.   They were slow to seat me, slow to take my order, didn't check on me after my food was served, and slow to take my payment. The last was when there were only 2 other occupied tables, one of which also complained about slow service. The decor was basic. Like many in the area they seem to offer dinner and show discounts or specials.   I ordered garlic naan, saffron rice, veg samosa, and chicken xacutti. The rice was a bit dry and looked like it might have been sitting out, but the naan was delicious, and the xacutti was amazing with great heat and flavour. Everything was nicely presented and even the bill came with a (packaged) hot towel, and small mango lassi."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food, lovely ambiance, and impeccable service.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I can't seem to remove my review, so I would like to update it. Dhaba did get back to me regarding the bank fee and actually amended the policy! Not only did they explain, apologize, review and change their policy, they did so with class! I did state from the beginning that their food absolutely delicious and impeccably prepared. Because of the excellent customer service in this case, which to me is as important as the food quality, I give them a full five star rating. I'd also like to add that when the orders have taken longer than an hour to arrive, the orders have been quite large and they've phoned me to keep me updated. Thank you for listening, Dhaba!!!"}
{"text":"Second floor seating only. Excellent food, tastes amazing and service is attentive and appropriate. Neither too heavy nor too distant. Ambiance is average, a little stale looking, but sit by the window and watch the world drive by or stare at the gawkers and pedestrians below. Music is always horrible.!"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet after accidentally discovering Dhaba from a message board about where to purchase transit passes.  Restaurant is upstairs, and I'd say it falls into the \"fine dining\" category with white table cloths on each table, wall paintings, etc.  I eat a lot of Indian food, and have to say that this was the best lunch buffet I have every visited!   First of all, there must have been 10 different kinds of salads, some with seafood.  The chicken tikka masala was bubbling on a huge hot plate garnished all around with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and lemon wedges.  There were at least 20 entrees from which to choose from, and several desserts along the side wall.    Quality of the food was excellent!  Everything tasted so fresh and spiced just right.  There's a sign above the buffet that serves as a reminder not to waste food, and since there's so much to choose from, it helped me avoid overloading my plate.  You can always go back for more if still hungry, just don't waste the food, right?   The only negative was that a lunch special mango shake was offered for half price on a wall poster, but my bill showed it full price.  It turns out that the half price shake is a half-size shake and apparently needs to be requested as \"lunch mango shake.\"  The waiter took the difference off the bill, however and I left a little extra tip since I hadn't asked for the right thing.    Lastly, with such good quality food and large variety to choose from, one might think it would be expensive, but it was the price of an average lunch buffet at most affordable restaurants.  Just call ahead if you want to know for sure, and I'm sure that you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I've come here for the buffet lunch a few times for a quickish meal between work.  At $12.95 per person for all-you-can-eat, this is actually super close to what you're paying for Indian food from the food court on The Path (vs. an average of ~$10).  I like the available array: a table of cold, salad bar stuff including a couple salads with shrimp.  Sometimes there's also a hot tray at the very end of the table, holding a tasty fried fish.  Watch out for the small pickled items and sauces offered at the beginning of this table. I recommend spooning them beside your food rather than right onto it if you've never had them before - some of them can be quite spicy, even if they're green rather than a fire-engine red colour.   If you do happen to eat something super, my-guts-are-on-fire spicy, order the mango lassi which will be poured halfway into your wine glass.  I do wish the lassi was served colder.   My typical dish is loaded with naan bread, spinach paneer, and tons of butter chicken.  Tip: Grab a small bowl from the dessert bar to fill with butter chicken, then put all your other foods on your dish.  It keeps the naan from getting soggy, and you won't lose a single drop!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. We ordered for delivery and it took them 1.5 hours to get it to us even though they're just down the street from us. They also sent the food via taxi and we had to go down to our lobby to pick it up because they didn't want to come up. I ordered delivery for a reason. The food was also not great. The paneer was watery, the butter chicken sauce was also thin and had very few pieces of chicken. I've taken Indian culinary courses so I think i'm a pretty good judge of Indian food and this was not worth the 1.5 hour wait and the annoyance of having it delivered by a cab. I do not support this place and hope this review will encourage you to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Really delicious Indian food. Excellent presentation. Service was really really good too.   Highly recommend as a pre baseball game dinner!!"}
{"text":"I went again to Dhaba and was pleased. They treat everyone like a valuable friend. The food is delicious, yes but the range of goodies and the service makes it one of my favourite places."}
{"text":"Great food - excellent butter chicken, lamb tikka, and spicy prawns. Terrible service - could not provide basic recommendations, sometimes rude. Clearly understaffed; the two waiters on duty were struggling to manage three tables of ~3-4 people each. Still a solid choice, if only for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch buffet.  $12.95 + $1.79 mango lasi.  Food was fresh, good variety, tasty and not too greasy.  They had a great mix of cold (salads) plus hot dishes (rice, curry, naan, etc.).The place was full and is popular with the lunch crowd (which is a good thing).  Would definitely go back for the lunch buffet option."}
{"text":"Again wish had read reviews before ordering, specifically from people who had issues with take out. Ordered online, and driver called an hour later from wrong address. He was about 15 minutes away, and after 30 mins I called the restaurant. Very unhelpful or catering about the situation. When pushed, he said if it was cold he would do another order, which would have added at least another hour. Not keen to refund, directing to the online company. No apology or other suggestion. When the food came, my husband accepted it as it wasn't stone cold and we were hungry after over 90 minutes. Food was actually good, and would have used them again except for the poor customer service. Too many good Indians in Toronto to use a place that has multiple bad reviews about their delivery, and which they haven't bothered to address."}
{"text":"Good Food ! Horrible Service !  This is one of those restaurants which serves pretty good Indian food but don't know how to serve their customers. We had two horrible experiences. We aren't going back ever.  1. Once we visited the restaurant, we were a party of three. We ordered drinks while settling in. Then a few minutes later when it came to ordering food we ordered two mains with rice and naan. The waiter refused to take the order and mentioned that we must order one main per person. We were aghast by the the behavior, paid for the drinks and left.  2. We visited Dhaba again after atleast a year, the food was good as usual. When we were done we had some left overs. Rice, Chicken curry and Parantha. We asked the server Paras to pack our food to go. He packed the rice, naan and the curry all in one box rendering the food inedible. We called the restaurant to complain today, the person plainly said we don't usually pack the food as it is a sit down restaurant and you should have specified to pack everything separately. (the chutzpah !!)  Visit only if you care about good food and not the way you're treated. We'll never go back again."}
{"text":"I tried Dhaba for the first time and actually used their delivery option as it was a late night and didn't feel like going out.  I placed the order through just-eat.ca and the process was very good.  Delivery arrived within the prescribed time, and it was about 45mins from when I placed the order.  And I must say, I was a little concerned the quality of delivery would not be too good.. . but lo and behold it was delicious.  and filling.  I would certainly recommend this place for cuisine."}
{"text":"With my free evening in Toronto I skipped the CN tower trap and went for something looking more local. Having been to Canada before I was overwhelmed with the great Indian cuisine I have encountered, so that was my obvious target.   Let me start with the bad here, service. They were very, very slow on the uptake. I sat for 5 min without water or the question of a beverage. But to the credit of the staff once I pointed this out every thing was great (I wasn't rude I just mentioned I would like some water).   I ordered a smattering of things, Salty Lassi (this one was tasty but a bit to salty for me, they are all different). Softshell crab starter, the crispy batter exterior was delicious and exotic, however the frying oil weighed the whole thing down by the end. If they can fix the oil part this is a 5 star dish!  For main I had the house special Lamb chops, very good however tough. No real note, it was worth what i paid for it, might even eat it again but I would not enter it in a competition.   The Roti was great and fresh, the mixed pickle was also tasty.   Overall good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"Yabba dhaba dude!!  That was the first thing that came to mind when a friend and I decided to place a delivery order and it arrived 35-40minutes later (sooner than the hour we were told) and the food was HOT (like piping hot) and the containers were packed to the brim!  Echoing the initial concern of Sunny G, I too was worried that take-out would be lesser quality, smaller portions and likely arrive cold. Not so... not even a little.   Together we shared a Chicken biryani, Butter chicken, Lamb vindaloo and 2 garlic naan. Totaling about $55, reasonable considering delivery was free because we spent more than $35 AND there was an additional 10% discount for ordering our food via their website!  It's been a long time since I last had \"Good\" Indian cuisine and my friends this is certainly GOOD Indian. I don't know how others are putting Aroma (an Indian restaurant chain) in even the same league as 309 Dhaba, it's not even on the same planet. Dhaba wins... every... single... time.   While I won't go through each dish individually, here are the reasons why collectively, Dhaba is way bheta (get it):  1) Excellently seasoned and cooked - as the advertisement says, Indian food is NOT spicy... it's cooked with a mix of spices BUT they certainly bring the heat.  2) Expertly Cooked! Chicken in the Biryani and Butter Chicken was moist and plump. HOWEVER, the winner was the Lamb Vindaloo, cooked perfectly tender while still maintaining some of its lamb flavour, mixing well with the fiery sauce  3) HUGE portions. I've had Indian cuisine across Toronto and the GTA and never have I seen so much food for a price. There is no skimping on portion size at Dhaba! They dole our huge generous portions of meat with each dish. Excellent bang for your buck!  4) Their Garlic Naan made me pee a little in my pants (just a little) as it tickled my taste-buds in a way garlic and tandoor cooked bread has never tickled me before!  Overall this his all my Indian food hot spots: Price, quality, quantity, flavour, spice and service. This place is just shy of the best I've ever had but it's damn close!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a weeknight as a party of 3. The lamb sampler appetizer was *excellent*; the other dishes ( Aloo Gobi, Chicken vindaloo ) were OK. We'll done but not remarkable. Service pleasant but a tad inattentive on a slow night. Limited dessert selection. Will try again due to the lamb."}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that I absolutely love Indian food, which makes this experience so much worse.  I came here with friends that also work downtown because they wanted Indian food and have been here before... they're not foodies like me, but fun to hang out with so I accepted.  The food was pretty awful, cheap ingredients, veggies looked kind of old, tandoori chicken was dry, well all the meat was pretty dry, and that's saying A LOT for butter chicken!  I would not go here again, even if it was free, which it wasn't - it's $13 for lunch buffet and I was charged $8 for a bottle of sparking water!  Sure, it was a big bottle of VOSS, as it was the only one they had, but come on!  I'm not at a Michelin Star restaurant, I'm at an Indian buffet!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here since my usual Indian place was closed. I know a lot of people complained about delivery times but I had no problem.   I ordered 2 vegetarian dishes,  salad and garlic naan.  The food was lackluster at best. It had no flavour more then stale cumin. I've had better from frozen. It was nasty. Even the rice tasted like it was soaked in butter. I chucked my leftovers despite how much they cost me.   There is so much good Indian food around, I can't imagine a reason to order from here again."}
{"text":"the place looks fancy and sure the prices will make u think, the food is real good but the taste is as mediocre as it can get. the service is slow even though the restaurant was relatively empty. then comes the cheque part. when you check in on yelp you get 10 or 20 $ off of the bill. but the illiterate waiters do not know that we cannot print out the yelp coupons. it just has to be used within 4 hrs and the business can discard the coupon once they use it. but we were denied and so had to pay overpriced bill fully. i would dare go there again."}
{"text":"Pepper. This restaurant really loves pepper. Everything was over-peppered. Even my garlic naan had pepper on it. What gives, man? I didn't see a disclaimer for this.   Ambiance is really great for a romantic night out. Very cozy tables. Unfortunately I came with my boss, so it was not an ideal place for me to bust out my laptop and work on reports. Ha. But that's besides the fact.   I played it safe and got saag paneer.  He got something with prawns, which was alright. My paneer was good, but the saag had an overwhelming amount of pepper in it. I just ate the paneer out of the curry and left the rest. Garlic naan would've been better if I had something to dip it into. Sadness. I drank four waters to wash everything down.   For the price they're charging here, you may as well go someplace where you can finish your meal with a smile."}
{"text":"The Dhaba Indian Excellence, is the restaurant you should aim for if you are looking for traditional Indian food. When me and my family first came to Toronto, we were very confused to where to go for Indian food that would make us feel back to our roots. We then came across The Dhaba, and it seems hard to get to any other restaurant when it comes to taste, freshness, and service; the things the common family or individual seeks when going for a dine. The service was just great, with the staff constantly coming in to check with us and being there whenever we needed an assist. One of the most important factors which make this restaurant a must-visit is the several ways you can use the restaurant, be it for conference, business, or just family time. The food is great, the service is great, and so is the feeling. What else do you ask for? Great food and greatly recommended."}
{"text":"Worst Place.. Avoid this place if you can.. We were in Toronto last weekend and tried this place at lunch.. Food was bad , service was bad.. When we asked for the bill, the waiter gave the receipt and in front of us wrote in hand service charge 5 dollars and added it to the total price.When asked he said it is tip.. They themselves add the tip. We were party of 2... May be they know they will not be tipped for their attitude..   I would never recommend this place neither I would go here again.."}
{"text":"Came here with a gift certificate and got two prix fix dinners. The starters were ok, venison and shrimp. The venison was pretty tender but thought the spices were pretty bland, and the shrimp was also pretty tasteless. We had the eggplant/cod and butter chicken for mains. The cod was very bland and the butter chicken was fairly average. The rice and naan was nice, and the laasi was decent. But it's hard to mess those up.  Not a place I'd recommend, especially for the price, there's plenty of other options in the theatre district and I would choose any of those over this place. Maybe it's better to come for a buffet vs A la carte so you have more options."}
{"text":"They agreed and then apologized to not serve us just dessert. We left after being seated.  Not sure why they were confused. Then he says order at least $35 worth. Hell no!"}
{"text":"Been here many times now and each time it has hit the mark. Now it is an Indian buffet so a 5 star review is going to be pretty hard to come by just due to that fact, so 4 is a solid mark. They have an excellent selection, enough to keep you satisfied, and I cant say that there is much that is of low quality. I have mostly done lunch but sure dinner would be no different, just hungrier and can eat more.  The service is nothing to write home about but then again I dont expect that from a buffet to be honest and its not what I am coming here for. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for some Indian and have a big appetite to fully take advantage."}
{"text":"3.5.  Went for buffet last weekend. I only go to buffets at places that do a lot of business because I like to make sure it's fresh. The a la carte menu at Dhaba is quite pricey butt hey will make your food spicy for you. There's no ignoring the heavy spice level on the buffet delights, either. By this, I don't necessarily mean HOT spice, but full rounded flavours that aren't made milder for North American Palates.  They offerings were actually quite good and remained hot despite the fact that we arrived close to 2 pm. Some of the salads were decidedly not Indian but there was a nice cold shrimp salad with dill. Butter Chicken was a little sweet, but the chicken was tender smoky. Saag Paneer was not bad-- but as usual, most of the paneer was fished out. Veggie Dumplings (Malai Kofta) with a warm yogurt sauce were delish. Eggplant Curry had wonderful flavour but there were pieces of CORN in it. WHY DO PEOPLE PUT CORN IN EVERYTHING?? I like me some corn on the cob, but I hate little bits of it in my food! Samosas were hot an yummy but he Veggie Pakora were a little limp. Not sure why Fish and Chips were there-- maybe for kids who don't like Indian Food?  The service was great and the offerings were plentiful. One of the better Indian buffets in the city and a much more economical option to their pricey a la carte menu."}
{"text":"We've been to Dhaba countless times for late dinner because: 1. Food is awesome! Can't get over their butter chicken, sag with lamb, smoked chicken tikka masala. The garlic naans are super. 2. They open late on weekends 3. They do delivery 4. The waiters there are really nice and give us free shots of mango lassi on the house all the time"}
{"text":"Yabba Dhaba Doo! the garlic Naan was flipping great, and the tiger prawns and sag panneer very very tasty. stay away from the lobster, butter chicken had such a sweet eat with your fingers and lick the sauce off the plate taste to it.  lunch buffet here i come."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian.  I haven't had the dine-in experience, so this review is based solely on the take out.  The speed is excellent. They usually tell you that you'll be waiting about an hour and show up 40 minutes or so later. I ordered on a Friday evening and still received my order within 45 minutes - impressive!  I usually order chicken pakoras (bite sized chicken appetizers with a crispy coating and sweet/spicy dipping sauce), muttar paneer (homemade cottage cheese in a curry sauce), plain rice, and an aloo kulcha naan bread (naan stuffed with potatoes).   The pakoras are wonderful. I love the dipping sauce! They're by far the best pakoras I've had, juicy and crispy. The curry sauce in the muttar paneer is divine, thick and spiced to perfection. The paneer itself is the best I've had, it's pure creamy perfection. The naan breads from 309 are very special, if you watch the video I think it explains why. The oven they use to prepare them make them unique.   On other occasions, I've had butter chicken which was delicious, as well as aloo gobi and samosas. Both were perfect.  This restaurant boats free delivery and HUGE portion sizes, so the value for the price is fantastic.   Definitely give them a try, 309 just might become your favourite spot!"}
{"text":"Food = amazing! Drinks = poor. LOL. I have to laugh about this. I'm honestly not sure what makes a martini a martini but what I do know is that this place doesn't make them. Our martinis were regular cocktails (weak ones at that) with ice and a straw!!!! poured into a martini glass! LOL. Seriously??  Initially I was disappointed that there wasn't outdoor seating like most of the other restaurants on this King Street strip area. But the restaurant was upstairs and we had nice window seating. It looked like a nice place for a dinner date. I wasn't on a date but the food was fabulous and I left full and happy. I ordered lamb vindaloo (that's what I always order!!) and my friend had butter chicken. Both dishes were really well prepared and plentiful. We stuffed ourselves and still had extras. The garlic naan was good and we at first thought it was a small order but once you eat rice and your main dish, the small pieces of naan is all you can handle anyway. It was a nice touch when they gave us mini sized mango sorbet to finish our meal.  This is my second review out of 3 from my weekend trip to Toronto... I wouldn't have eaten here all three days if I had known better! I had to only give it 4 stars because the drinks weren't good. But in general, I noticed during my trip that drinks are measured 1-2oz of liquor per drink (which they list of the menu) so no drink was REALLY good in Toronto anyway unless I made it myself in my hotel room!"}
{"text":"Very tasty fresh authentic late pm dining experience overlooking King St TIFF action. We had all vegetarian options that were all delicious.  Dal, sag paneer, a few others.  I wasn't keen on Indian, but my visiting friend was, and I was soon happily converted.  Very affordable with lots to take home for the next day.  Very competent server.  Lovely location and white table cloth dining.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was pretty horrified by the taste and quality of those good. Butter chicken is the most basic and beloved by Americans/Canadian Indian dish, and this butter chicken was awful. It had this extremely thin, watery sauce that had a milky flavor and none of the distinct tomato/sweet flavors were blended. It was disgusting. Not to mention the chicken was incredibly over cooked, making it super dry and chewy and the sauce did not stick to it and redeem it. The rice was over cooked and dry and the naan was big surprise, DRY! Please improve your food 309, for the Love Of Indian food."}
{"text":"If I wrote this review a few years ago I'd have placed it at five stars. However, they have become so stingy it leaves me baffled.   These guys seem to have gone so far down hill they can't even afford to give you a plain piece of naan on an almost $50 order. Naan is cutlery, no way around it you can't eat butter chicken without rice, or naan. They give you neither of those things.   They should be ashamed to call themselves a restaurant. Restaurants don't force you to pay for cutlery."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place has many gluten-free options, including various salads, plain rice, biriyani, butter chicken, goat curry, fish curry, chenna masala, and others. While the dishes are labelled with the names of the dishes, they aren't labelled with which ones are gluten-free. Fortunately, there was always wait staff around to ask about it.   The foot itself was pretty good. The goat curry was really good but the butter chicken was just ok. the salads were fresh and the rice wasn't over or undercooked. Overall, good experience with friendly staff.   TL;DR lots of options but you have to ask which are gluten-free"}
{"text":"I ordered this for online delivery.  I would have given this 5 stars except the $30 minimum order was really steep.  Also, I requested 8pm delivery and they delivered it at 7:30 to the front desk and I luckily checked my voicemail at 8:10 when I was wondering where my food could be.  Why request a specific time if you're going to be 30 minutes off?    The food however was DELICIOUS.  I ordered the butter chicken that was SO creamy and delicious, the chicken was juicy and it went perfectly with the garlic naan.  I also ordered the vegetable samosas.  They were literally the best samosas I have ever had.  The ingredients were extremely fresh inside and you can tell they do not use anything frozen.  I also ordered the Okra Milchi Pulav.  Unforunately I am so full I couldn't eat but a bite.  It was spicy and seemed good but I couldn't fully appreciate it.  it will be for leftovers!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with this restaurant. I placed a take out order at 5:30pm for a 7:00pm pickup. when I arrived at 7:00pm, they were not ready and I was advised it will take another 15 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes I got my order. We go over to our friends place and after a few hours of socializing, we open our food. To my surprise I get 2 butter chicken and instead of 2 lamb tikka masala, I get 2 chicken tikka masala. So now we have 4 chicken dishes which basically had the same curry. We go through our meal very disappointed and the food was not to our satisfaction to say the least. Black lentils were very watery, fish curry had too much black pepper & both chicken dishes had pretty much the same gravy. The worst part is, I call them next morning to ask only for a refund of the 2 tikka masala dishes and after harassing me for 2 days, they declined a refund of $32. They wanted left overs brought back to the restaurant for a refund, can anyone believe that? Then they go, we will give a no charge dish on our next visit. Do they really think I will come back to their restaurant specially after this kind of ridiculous customer service? It just amazes me that a restaurant business, which totally relies on customer experience and word of mouth references, can actually kill a customer relationship for $32. In light of so many good Indian restaurants in Toronto area, I would completely write this one off. Why bother?"}
{"text":"Overall this is probably one of the best Indian restaurant I have been to and also open after 11pm to the late night crows. I really love their mango Lassi and naan, the taste of food and service is very decent but overall the food are certainly overcharged for the portion and what it is."}
{"text":"Dhaba is definitely one of my go-to Indian spots in Toronto. Heck, I think it's my only go-to Indian spot in Toronto.   I really like the food here. I've had my fair share of Indian food and I can honestly say that the food here is pretty on point. I usually come here with my coworkers and we always end up ordering the Dhaba's platter for an appetizer. Then we have the Madra's chicken curry, lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, and the chicken tikka masala. Of course, you can't eat indian food without a couple of orders of garlic na'an and saffron rice. We always tell them to make it REALLY spicy and it's usually really good.   The service is also excellent. Those guys are always really quick to fill up your glass or grab those dirty plates, or bring you more saffron rice and garlic na'an if you're really feeling it.   I do have to agree that the prices are pretty steep here, especially for Indian food. Luckily, I find myself in Toronto for work so I can write off my escapades at Dhaba as a business expense. If I didn't have that luxury, I think I'd be less inclined to gorge on Indian food once a week."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews before coming so I was prepared for bad service. That's why this gets 3 stars and not 5 stars. Service really depended on your server. It was great when we got here. We ordered drinks and an appetizer and were served right away, but had to get our server to place our dinner order, and to pay our bill. It was an hour and a half for the entire meal. There were 3 servers. Two were very attentive and one not and that's who we got. Food was excellent. One review said greasy and our food definitely was not. One person said salty, and I would say I agree, but not to the extent that it ruined the meal. As far as too much pepper...it's an Indian restaurant, newsflash the food is spicy.  If you come prepared for slow service, it's good."}
{"text":"Dhaba is OK. But with aroma next door, I never really make it back.  The restaurants around Dhaba do everything better.  Host has the best naan bread... Aroma has got the sauces right (except that annoyingly their bathroom is upstairs... Hold it)  Wasn't blown away and prices are all comparable with these lunch buffets...  Happy spooning... Dessert or soup :) whichever is your fancy."}
{"text":"Great selection on the AYCE buffet tables.  A few of the authentic curry dishes were too spicy for me but I was still able to find enough delicious dishes to try.  The naan was soft and puffy and there was an endless supply.  I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what is in their food, but it was outstanding.  China masala (sp) and garbanzo beans and rice most flavorful Indian food I think I've ever had. Service was outstanding.  Server, by my mistake took plate away. The food was so good I said I had \"I think\" one more bite. She without hesitation, with a smile came right back with a bowl of beans and rice saying sorry. Out of control vegan food. Not a lot of options but it does not matter. Just say \"I'm vegan\" do what ever....  I loved it here. Thank you. I always try to give input how to do better but I have no thoughts. Nice job to all here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were thrilled with our entire experience at 309 Dhaba. From the gentleman who took us upstairs from the lower level entryway to every member of the waitstaff, everyone was kind, helpful, and polite. We ordered the Dhaba Platter and an order of Butter chicken with rice and two garlic naan - all to share between two people. Each bite was fabulous. We enjoyed the variety of items in the dhaba platter and with the entree and bread/rice there was enough to be full with extras packed up for leftovers. We came on a Saturday night and enjoyed the live music. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Everything was clean and the restaurant was well-decorated. I would absolutely visit this restaurant again as well as definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"I ordered the food online from Dhaba's website. The mattar paneer and butter chicken were fairly decent. I wouldn't say there's anything particularly special about them. I did expect a higher heat level in terms of spices. This is Indian food, after all, and I expect that  \"fairly spicy\" (as described to me) means that my mouth will burn deeply and my nose will water slightly. No such luck.   But the curries were creamy, very rich,  and not too oily. I could have done with less salt but it was only slightly noticeable. The naan was soft and delivered in foil bags designed to keep them fresh. The service on the phone was impeccable and the restaurant took our order even past 10 pm on a weeknight."}
{"text":"I ordered last night 3 dishes (2 chicken and 1lamb) and was extremely disappointed.  Each dish had only a handful of tiny chicken or lamb pieces. All the rest was just a watery sauce. In total I paid $60. We are two small eaters, but we were both left hungry after finishing this poor meal.  I will never order here again."}
{"text":"One of the only downtown sit-down restaurants open on new year for dinner, Dhaba did not disappoint! The service was overall very caring, but there was a bit of confusion getting us settled (we weren't given menus for a while, so we were left just sitting there), water refills were infrequent, and food came a bit slow. Compared to their next door neighbor, Aroma, Dhaba is a bit more expensive with less efficient service. However, I did enjoy the food! Generous portion sizes compared to Aroma and the presentations of dishes were quite pretty - even the rice, which we received on the house tonight! If you can't handle spice, Dhaba might be better suited than some of the other Indian establishments downtown (especially Aanch - so spicy!), but you could also argue that the food here has lost its authenticity - clearly tailored to suit the taste buds of non-Indian customers.  We had the Dal (ask to have it made dairy-free), Saag Paneer, and Makai Okra. The Dal was pretty hearty - lots of beans, quite viscous, but bland, which some people (like me) might like more than a more seasoned version. The Makai Okra was very pretty, but I wasn't a fan of the corn and overall blandness. At least it wasn't mushy. The biggest disappointment was the family-style shared vegetable platter, which was listed as vegan but turns out that it is usually cross-contaminated with yogurt (dairy) :'( I was really looking forward to trying the soy paneer...  $51 pre-tip for 3 vegetarian mains + roti. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service but have had better. Our order was messed up and in end the bill was messed up as well. But food overall which chicken and mix veg was good."}
{"text":"We called this place the day before my birthday and made a reservation for the night after. The man on the phone confirmed my reservation and confirmed that as mentioned on Yelp, the dinner menu is all you can eat with 3 courses. I had to call the next day to increase the size of my reservation and happened to confirm the menu once again, I was told there is no all you can eat dinner and Yelp along with the staff member who advise me so were wrong. The man on the phone behaved quite rudely and made it sound like I had lost my plot. He said the member who advised me so yesterday was new and probably didn't know what he was saying. How unprofessional is that? Safe to say I will stay away from this place, they ruined bday plans."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm unimpressed by the quality of Indian restaurants in downtown Toronto, and this place is no exception.  Food was OK, but lacked that characteristic punch of flavor.  Prices were too high for the quality.  The staff were very apathetic about their customers, and one of them scowled and then stomped off when we asked to split a check for a business meal.  I will keep looking for a better Indian option.  Also, I would recommend to the restaurant that they improve their cocktail menu.  The list is quite long, but all are fruity/sweet drinks."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Dhaba because a friend recommended the place. We didn't even get the food because 2 hours later we still hadn't received the food. To cancel we were put on hold multiple times and were told an additional 20 minutes each time we called. Very frustrating.  After all that, they charged my credit card after us explicitly saying no. If there was a possibility to give zero stars I would. Terrible!  Please note I was not in a hotel and the order placed was through delivery. In the end the resolution did not come through Dhaba or their third party online system partners orderIndian.com but rather through RBC, my bank, and through their fraud program. Terrible service from Dhaba and extremely frustrating that all of their comments from the owner/manager following bad reviews places blame on the customers. After numerous phone calls and attempts to resolve with Dhaba I had to resort to my banking institution to declare fraud and will have to follow up with the BBB. Dhaba definitely needs to handle customer incidents with better care."}
{"text":"Visited Dhaba recently for a friends birthday. Service was ok, food was good but not great. I've had better Indian food for a lot less. Garlic Naan and Butter Chicken were my favs. I'd recommend this restaurant if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but incredibly slow. 2 entrees took over 30 minutes in a near empty restaurant. Service is also slow. The waitstaff seem to go to the beat of their own drum. I asked for something, they would go and clean tables, fold cloths and 5 minutes later get desired item. This happened on numerous occasions. It was odd service to me. But, who knows. Is it the style in this country?  Also, the entrees did not come with rice. It had to be ordered separately which I'm also not used to. So it made dinner pricer since most meals were $15+ and then the rice about 4."}
{"text":"I ordered the bharta and saag aloo for delivery.   The spices were freshly ground and the vegetables used were also fresh. I prefer the eggplant to be charcoal grilled with a smokey flavour but this one was hilighted with fennel instead. I don't love fennel, but my biggest complaint was the amount of oil used, which seemed like 5 tbsp in just the one dish. Had to put it on paper towel to let it soak off.  Only Â¼ did. So, 2.5/5.   The saag aloo was nice with coriander and cumin. It was far less greasy with a fresh, pleasing flavour (and hot chilies). 3.5/5.   Portions were standard sized.   There was not much else a gluten free vegan could eat on the menu, so that was it. Pretty good, especially if you like fennel!"}
{"text":"Amazing offering at the lunch buffet, over 20 different salads alone! The service was impeccable; friendlier and more prompt than most restaurants. My server brought me garlic naan without me asking (my favorite Indian dish on earth), and brought me a carafe if soda water when I asked for a little bit extra to mix in with my gin.  Phenomenal value for a lunch buffet (under $12)!"}
{"text":"We have come to this restaurant probably 4-5 times. I gave. 4 as sometimes the food can take such a long time to come. We usually get the butter chicken, garlic naan and rice. It is very good and probably one of my fav Indian places. I've tried a couple other dishes there and it was very delicious. The ambience is calm and quiet which I like. The service is good too."}
{"text":"Nice selection... many choices, prices are reasonable.  I think it's great for those new to Indian food, as you can visually choose what you'd like to get and go for seconds on what you'd like.  Great selection of meat and chicken dishes... as well as veggie dishes :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience! We were met with a mix of warmth and professionalism, to provide us with top notch service. Our food was freshly prepared and full of flavor, as well as great texture. Our selective / somewhat picky daughter thoroughly enjoyed trying the butter chicken and fought over the leftovers the next day! We all enjoyed the hospitality and amazing, tasty food."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 4 STAR, for delivering and for having EXCELLENT food - I've had Butter chicken from here several times now - and it just melts away in your mouth. There is just never enough of the food...and sharing is OUT OF THE QUESTION. So why not 4 stars? It's a little pricey.  A bit spicy. IT TAKES 48 MINUTES TO DELIVER. EVERY TIME. WTF? in that time I can waddle over to Christie Street to Banjara, be full and would have started waddling back.  That being said though, this is located in a pricey part of downtown and I would recommend it highly, if you're in the Entertainment district and want to go to a good Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet.  * Dirty * Routinely overcook naan / tandoori chicken / butter chicken * Did I mention they are very dirty  and they don't care? * Very often gives me runs. Spending time in the bathroom instead of working is not fun. * dirty!!! We went through the stack of like 15 plates, and they were all dirty.  We will probably not visit this establishment any more."}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, the service was very slow and our waiter just seemed like he would much rather be somewhere else than serving us our dinner. We had Sag Paneer = excellent.  Garlic Naan = Perfect.  Bombay Prawns = Amazing.  Tiger Prawns Appetizer = YES.  All very good.  One thing - when you order iced tea here it's already sweet so you don't need sweetener.  Oh, and they play live music -- totally cool, not too loud but great ambience."}
{"text":"Food is very salty.  Decor is dated & they seat the people of color at the back of the restaurant!!!  FOR REAL!!!  Lesley E., visiting from NYC"}
{"text":"Well -- I have been to Dhaba a number of times, but went last week and what a disappointment!  Perhaps this was due to the pre-Christmas crowd?  Whatever the reason, even if you have been in the past and enjoyed, I would think carefully about going back here.  The buffet used to be wonderful!  Lots of great choices both hot and cold. This time the choices seemed blah and uninspiring, the tandoori chicken was not great and the sizzling plate of Chicken Tikka and Vegetables was missing chicken!  There was also not the variety to the food that I recall - and I have been here a number of times in the past.  The food was not hot (temperature wise), and it seemed like they had really reduced the flavor in a lot of dishes.  Remember, spicy does not necessarily mean 3-engine fire hot... spicy can be aromatic and flavourful.  Butter chicken with tomato and delicate tones of cardamom.    Anyways -- up to you -- but if you know of someone really good - I would consider it as a dining option first!"}
{"text":"Local indian restaurant woth pretty much only indians there. When we entered there was so much aromatic smells and spices in the air. It was lovely and very pleasant.  You can see the whole king street from the restaurant which is nice and active. Very fun location.  I've had what I believe is the house speciality. I don't remember the name but the waitress strongly recomended it. One spicy and one less spicy. The starter was so tasteful with vegetables and spicy chicken drumstick.  The naan bread was ok but not great and they have badoit as sparkling water which is always nice.   Overall, i did enjoy the place but though it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the top two Indian restaurants in the GTA. Most importantly, the food is DELICIOUS. The ingredients are fresh and innovative (e.g., the addition of porcini mushrooms to a classic paneer dish; garnishing with pineapple; adding avocado to chaat), and the presentation and overall attention to detail are exquisite. Some stand out dishes IMO are the seekh kebab, eggplant, porcini paneer, and grilled platter. Naan is outstanding. Service is quite good at the restaurant itself, but make sure to place delivery orders well in advance as it can take over 2 hours (!!!) to get your food. If they could work out a faster delivery option (30-45 mins max), this place would easily get a mythical sixth star. Chef PK is also a great guy, and he's always happy to work with you on catering parties and events. We've catered a couple parties from Dhaba and it's always a hit. So to summarize, this restaurant does the classics extremely well and remains faithful to traditional Indian cuisine (e.g., they use a charcoal tandoor, not gas) while updating and adding modern, innovative touches. Definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"\"Excuse me waiter, can you bring me another sweet lassi?\"  Thumbs up for the service (and the sweet lassi!)  Really cool that the salad selection is as extensive as the curry selection.  My favorites---the spinach and paneer curry and of course, anything with lamb along with the garbanzo bean salad.  My one complaint---soggy naan!  Overall a nice refined indian place great for large group of out of town guests (like us).  PS- park on the street (not with the shady guy in the lot trying to charge $20!)"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times at least. All 4 times my experience was about the same: the food was good and the service was really bad. don't know why, looks like the chef has his act together but the service is consistently bad at this place. Its the only reason i knocked off 2 stars. Its almost like they are doing you a favour plopping the food in front of you. given them 4 chances, not going back."}
{"text":"Food is standard Indian fare.  Passable.  Very very very slow service.  If you are going in late ( they only have one cook at night) please prepared for a long wait.   Biryani portion very small and had practically boiled chicken pieces thrown in  as an after thought.   Other things we had onion pakoras - very oily and over cooked.     Goat curry good  Garlic Naan - good   If you are downtown and it's late and craving for Indian food  - Dhaba is the place to go.  When drunk the food and the wait are tolerable."}
{"text":"Wow! I spoke with Bala the manager. He set up a tasting menu each 3oz so i measure my calories.  I had an amazing time.  I rarely give 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian places on King St. W. Really soft naan, flavourful curries, and the saag paneer doesn't skimp on the paneer like at other restaurants. But service has been consistently abrupt the last 2 times I've been here. They seem irritated if you don't order wine or a lot of appetizers and just kind of plop the dishes down in front of you without saying anything."}
{"text":"I went there with a party of 5 people, without reservation. We were seated in a timely manner.   The waiters were very courteous, knew the menu well and made good wine pairing suggestions. Two of my friends asked for their dishes to be not too spicy, and the staff made sure it would be as they wished.   We all took the 30$ prix fixe option. 3 courses, served with all you can eat rice and naan.   I had the chicken tandoori for a starter. Good portion, nice presentation and was spicy (5/5). I then had the butter chicken. Delicious sauce but I wish the chicken would have been slightly tender. I give it 3/5.   The waiters brought 2 huge bowls of basmati rice with cumin and herbs (4/5). The bread also came with the mains, and you could tell that it was freshly made. There was both classic and garlic naan served (5/5).   For dessert, we were all served a mango smoothie that was refreshing and not too heavy after such a big meal (4/5).   Overall a good experience. it took them a little too long to bring the bills but at least they broke it down for every guest.   The only thing is that they yell a lot in the kitchen, the staff should try not to do that as it looks a little bit sketchy for the customers."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from 309 from an online delivery service. I was a little wary after some overpriced bad experiences from Indian restaurants in Toronto, but 309 has restored my faith. I wouldn't call it authentic, but I would definitely call them DELICIOUS.   I tried their Mattar Paneer and Chicken Korma, with a side of plain rice. Everything was huge portions. Two people could not finish this over two meals. It arrived fresh and on time. Will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"There aren't too many good choices for Indian near the theatre district and a visit to Dhaba would be playing it safe if you're in a time crunch for making the curtain call.   A few years ago, the restaurant was the subject of the show 'Restaurant Makeover', the interior redesigned by Brenda Bent and her husband, the famous chef Susur Lee. Despite the iconic names attached to the reputation of this eatery, the dim lighting, the white walls and the robotic manners of the waiters and waitresses here make the atmosphere a bit cold and distant.   As for the food, portions are a bit on the smaller side and taste leans towards 'new age' Indian - if you're expecting classics, you won't get it here. We tried the avocado chaat papdi ($9.95), a cold appetizer that was pleasant, but a little too heavy on the tamarind for my liking.  The makai okra ($11.95) here is nice but nothing special; the aloo kadchi - cashew and paneer - will have you licking your lips for more!  A plate of rice is large enough to share, although the price ($3.95) isn't so satisfying. My problem is that the food here is too polished and lacks the kick that most people seek in South Asian cuisine.  The bill, between two people, including one appetizer, two entrees, one rice and order of naan, two glasses of red wine and a complimentary mango dessert, came to $63. Being someone who goes out for Chinese food often, I know that quality is not reflective of the price. Dhaba is nice for a date if you're stuck in the area, but go to Little India if you want the real deal; for the same dollar amount, you could bring a few friends too.  TIP: If you come here for the lunch deal, print a $1 off coupon from the restaurant website."}
{"text":"Horrible food... slow slow service!   We came to the restuarant at around 10 pm.. It was pretty much empty! We were soon seated... but the staff did seem bit lost and confused...  We ordered Avocado Chaat Papdi... there wasn't a tint of avocado in it... I was excited to try it.. it was a mashed samosa with yogurt and topped with some papdi.. for $10.. I didn't find avocado in there... I did find a small piece of stick in it.. For the main meal, we had a cauliflower curry and kadahi paneer, side of rice, and couple of roti... the food  was passable.. it wasn't that great! It was just plated well....  The service was slow and the staff seemed to have no idea.. not going back!"}
{"text":"The food could be pretty tasty except it was way too salty and too oily. I ordered Matar Aloo (green peas with potatoes instead of Paneer) and potatoes were too big and hard. I prefer smaller pieces and softer, cooked longer. I also did not like that they did not serve papadum at the beginning - instead it was a fishy tasting fried \"waffle\" thing - very oily and ... we did not eat that. Other than that the customer service was very good, but I am not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Ordered their lamb korma and garlic naan on UberEATS. The naan was delicious, but the lamb korma was just okay."}
{"text":"Horrible service ever! But good food. Great opening hours.  Indian fine-dine located in core downtown is open until midnight and serves delicious and spicy Indian food. Over the period their service kept shaming themselves. They had 3 chances rebuild their reputation. But, here I am writing this review...  Once they made it mandatory for us to order 3 mains and 3 breads for 3 people, said it's their policy. where as on their menu it was clearly mentioned as 20$ per person minimum order, so that makes it 60$, while trying to order we already had our drinks on the table which were like 45$ in total.. and we were to order 2 mains and 2 breads and 1 rice, but then we just left. \"Well That's okay it happens, must be a new server, a bit confused.\"  Next time we went, we ordered generously for the party of 4. food was good again, now we asked the leftovers to be packed, we as they mentioned earlier 4 of us we ordered our own mains and sides and 2 starters we shared along with drinks. Now first we were told that they are fine-dine and they don't pack, lol I have to many fine-dines, which encourage you to take left overs instead of wasting food. Anyways when we asked, \"what would you do with the leftovers?\" They simply took the food and came back with to a bag. We were just confused that how come 2 different dishes and bread and rice are packed in this one bag. When at home we opened the bag, there was just one box, and when we opened the box, all we could see was a mess of food, bread, rice, chicken curry and veggie curry all together as if they just dumped it. We ended up throwing it.  I don't understand when they expect you to order individually, then how come they packed everything in one box, moreover I am vegetarian and my hubby is a meat eater, and he packed everything in one. God !  Well the final round, we went again in a group of four when one of our friends insisted, as he heard some good reviews and he never visited then earlier; poor guy little did he knew :P ordered some starters, mains and drinks. Well, drinks come, then came the starters and then the bread.. wait a min, bread but what about curries? after 20 mins of breads sitting on the table came the curries.  well we ordered: 1. daal makhani 2. goat curry 3. chicken curry 4. chickpea  we got, 1. dal yellow, 2. fish, 3. chicken and 4. chickpea :P so we had not cold breads and half of our mains and something we did not order. :) It's okay, it happens, and it was already 1:30 hours after we went in. Now we called the waiter to clarify.. and he now took the wrong order and 3 mins later he comes again with fish :P and not sure about the daal :P We just ate and left.. and never returned :)"}
{"text":"Service was below average.. Confusion, heated arguments  from the kitchen due to a misunderstanding on orders.. Food was alright but not a great place to go to anymore.. There are better around.."}
{"text":"We walked upstairs to this dark, romantic, restaurant.  I like a dim ambiance but this was far too dark.  So dark that you couldn't even see what you're eating.  Who knows what they could feed us!  We had to tell them to turn the lights on for us because we couldn't see the food enough to even cut it.    Our samosas appetizer came out and the size was massive.  They should warn you about these things.  Luckily we only ordered 3.  It could of fed like 10 of us!  It didn't taste that great either because the batter was too thick.  The filling was also a little spicy so I didn't enjoy it.  The only thing I like here is the Naan bread, don't think you can go wrong with that.  The butter chicken was actually really good.  It was very tender and the sauce was splendid.    I didn't like this place too much, from the ambience to the food.  Sorry but I would rather much try the Italian restaurant patios on the streets."}
{"text":"We went to 309 Dhaba Indian Excellence restaurant for Friday dinner. Dhaba Indian Excellence was a nicely decorated upstairs restaurant in the Entertainment district. The service was friendly, but slow.  We ordered the Halibut Bengal Curry and the Mountain Goat dish with rice and Garic Naan. The Halibut Bengal Curry and Mountain Goat dish were pretty good. We ran out of rice and asked for another bowl of rice which they charged us again. 4 dollars for a small bowl of rice!  Will we go back? I doubt it. The food was okay, but overpriced. There are a lot of restaurants in the area that we can go to."}
{"text":"Great Service, amazing food.  Good and delicious portions..  Totally surprised about the comments previously done to the place, not fair!! Good surprise!  :)"}
{"text":"We were going for lunch buffet at a near by Indian buffet and was told to go to Dhaba instead (slightly less expensive and better food), props to my co-worker for the recommendation because he was correct. The food a Dhaba was amazing. You can can't go wrong at this buffet. Everything I got was delicious. Maybe the samosas weren't the best I've had but that would be the only slightly negative thing I could say about this place. Friendly staff, excellent food.....and it's a buffet (doesn't get much better for those who have trouble deciding what to get!!)."}
{"text":"The buffet is quite large and has so many options. There are lots of fresh salads, rice, naan, fruit as well as the usual curries and masala sauces. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"the food is pretty fresh and the dishes have excellent depth of flavor. service is okay. it's nice when the chef comes out to chat.   update:   over the last five years, i thought the quality was diminishing a bit, but i recently got catering from dhaba and every dish was top-notch. moreover, the service was outstanding. everybody who ate - including a few picky indian foodies - raved of it.   i will try the restaurant again soon."}
{"text":"Worse food and worse service! Came here for dinner the bill with tax ended up being $77.00 for two people and we ordered 3 items. The waiter had the audacity to pick up the spoon from the floor and put it back on my plate with a smile!!! I was shocked, the butter chicken was bland, shrimp biryani had no salt and naan bread was the size of a baby's toe!!!! Absolutely the most horrendous Indian restaurant on King West!!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I are always bringing out of town guests here (and visiting it ourselves, and frequently ordering delivery when we need some delicious Indian comfort food).   We've been frequenting the restaurant since seeing them featured on a \"Restaurant Makeover\" episode like, 2 years ago, (when the critical chef on that show tasted Chef P.K.'s food and was like \"Wow, everything is amazing I wouldn't change anything\" we *had* to try it!) and this is the only place we go for Indian food now.   This is absolutely *the* best Indian food we have found in the city!  (I can't speak for the buffet as we have never gone for lunch, but for dinner eating-in and delivery it's always fantastic!)   Yes it's a bit pricey, but it's in a pricey area and it is *soooo* worth it! The food is filling, the quality is high, we've never waited for a table, it's clean, the service is always terrific, they are great considering my food sensitivities, and the food is *always* amazing. I can't say this enough. We have never been disappointed.   Every curry dish has a delicious and distinct flavour which is *such* a nice change from Indian restaurants where everything tastes \"the same\" (you know what I'm talking about).   And yes the samosas are huge and puffy and spicy and big enough to share! But they are yummmmy! (Although we prefer the pakoras to start anyway *mmhm* chickpea flour makes it a nice gluten-free alternative!)  Now my fiancÃ© loves really spicy food, I like a little spice but not too much and we find such a happy medium when we come here. If you like spicy, you *must* try the Goan Xacutti - it has such a refreshing spice (but with sweetness)...MMHM! For the not-so-spicy lovers, I recommend the butter chicken which we only recently tried as normally butter chicken is so borrrrrring...OMG not here. TRY THE BUTTER CHICKEN! It's amazing! Totally my new favourite (alongside the British-style Balti which I'm also a huge fan of!)  The saffron-rice is definitely worth the extra dollar or so as a step up from the plain rice. And the garlic naan is just...heavenly. (Sadly I can't have gluten anymore, but I used to enjoy it a lot!)   Also if there is something you're looking for on the menu and they don't have it, ask the server - I've found that they're very accommodating and have created or altered dishes for visiting friends.   And yes it takes about an hour for delivery, but if you know this you can plan in advance! ;) (And then salivate for an hour in anticipation of the deliciousness to come!) It is totally worth the wait.    Yes it's a bit pricey, but it's worth it. The depth and variety of the flavours will ruin all other cheap Indian food for you forever. (Fair warning!)"}
{"text":"I usually like to go more in depth with my reviews, but this is just a standard everyday Indian buffet resto. I know they have sit down meals at other times, but I was here for lunch and thus had the buffet. Nothing was bad, nothing was excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good freakin food. Had a salad there that was unique to Indian spices, all the ingredients paired so well with those spices. Also got the shrimp appetizer that was so tasty.... And everything else that we had. Unique dishes, and opens late! Can't wait to go back. Just wish they gave larger portions :)"}
{"text":"We initially walked past this place because they had a front man trying to lure customers inside. However we made a U-turn and we ended up coming here for dinner.  This was a pretty tasty experience, better than most Indian restaurants I have been to in the United States.   We all got the theater dinner special (no need to actually see a show to get this deal).  The waiter seemed brusque in his menu suggestions, however in hindsight he wanted to ensure we had a nice spread of dishes.   The chicken appetizer was quite smoky and flavorful, and more importantly the chicken was moist and tender.  The best entrÃ©e was the lamb vindaloo. It had a complex mix of flavors and spices, and there was just the right amount of heat.  The garlic naan was actually pretty tasty as well.   For dessert they brought us each a glass of Mango Lassi.  30 bucks per person.  I think this place is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Hardly excellence. The food was OK and the service was awful. The servers were aloof and barely acknowledged our presence.  One guy kept coming to our table to drop off food while talking on a cordless phone! They did not check in once to see how we were doing - but seemed to have plenty of time to do random things. At one point I waved a server down and he asked me what I wanted from across the room. RUDE.  Waited forever for the food even though the place was not busy. The chicken app was a paltry two pieces of bland chicken. The main courses were OK. One star for the service and poor attitude.  Toronto has a ton of great cheap Indian and Pakistani places. Don't bother with this overpriced place with bad service."}
{"text":"Food is ok.. Not so great, but the location and ambience is good.. Fish tawa was well cooked, but goat was like not cooked at all.. butter chicken was too sweet.. veg items were still upto Indian standards"}
{"text":"The food and buffet selection is good and service is acceptable. It is not my favourite but I would go again if I were not the one choosing the venue. There is not much to say about it, either good or bad, but the washrooms could use improvement. On another note, the 309 in front of the name, meaning #309 on King St W, seems to be tacked on for alphabetically sorted (numbers before letters) lists to accord it a higher priority (at the top of the list)."}
{"text":"For about a week after I moved into my new condo, I didn't want to cook anything. Enter the joy of online ordering + delivery! After preening through a number of Yelp reviews, I decided that Dhaba would be alright for takeout, as many of the more negative reviews seem to lean toward the service aspect of the restaurant. Anyway, I actually ended up ordering food from here twice in the same week, because it was so convenient and pretty darn tasty. I'm no expert on Indian eats by any means, but the garlic naan is delicious even when it's not piping hot and fresh, and the chana masala (my staple Indian dish) is great. The samosas are a little bit thicker and denser here than I'm accustomed to, although that could be attributed to the fact that they were a little bit cold when I ate them. My boyfriend loved the butter chicken!   One thing to note about ordering online is that you can only set the delivery time an hour from when you place the order - for instance, if you order at 6PM you can only set the delivery time for 7PM or later - but the food usually comes before the one hour mark. Every order comes with pappadums and chutney. The second time I got delivery, I was quite surprised to find a number of items \"compliments of the chef\" - an entire order of rice and garlic naan! I would definitely recommend Dhaba for takeout whenever a hankering for Indian food strikes, but you're too lazy to get dressed...not like that ever happens to me, or anything."}
{"text":"I have been there for Buffet at lunch and also at night for dinner. The ambiance is good and waiters are courteous too.  It is my favorite Indian Buffet place in downtown.You get a lot for the price you pay for buffet.The best thing is their wide selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian salads.I usually get full trying all the salads. I did not like the main course food in buffet.I have been there a lot and it is always the same.They make most of the food in cream so it is very heavy and not very delicious.If you really want to try something,their goat curry is the best. The desserts choices in buffet is also very limited and always the same.  I think they need to revise their menu and add more variety and up their quality of food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant.  The food is great - very tasty, but not too saucy.  We ordered a bunch of food to share for the table, so I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was all good!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable (our waiter was from Mumbai, so he was able to offer helpful insights into the authenticity and other characteristics of the menu items. The place is clean, not fancy or trying too hard for an Indian vibe but does make you feel you are in an Indian restaurant w/the traditional Indian music (recorded) playing in the background and its wall decorations.  Some window tables looking out on King St."}
{"text":"Some of the greatest Indian food I've ever had - including NYC, London, Paris, etc. Flavorful tender meat, amazing paneer dishes, excellent naan and paratha."}
{"text":"I've been to Dhaba to have their delightful all-you-can eat lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is a great deal and is available seven days a week. The food is quite good, not outstanding, but you really can't beat the price for the quality you get. Plus it gives you an opportunity to sample a number of different dishes. If you are dining there for dinner, the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka achari and the lamb vindaloo are highly recommended dishes."}
{"text":"It's a waste of time...!! 1st of all the server never came to take the order..finally came after 30mns to take the order..then the food came almost an hour late but the chicken tikka was extremely salty..  So basically waiting for something that we never ate...so finally we called the manager who rather than apologizing all he did was take it back and did not bother to compensate it with anything..!! Main course came after 1.5hrs...surprising part was I asked for salt and pepper and they had no pepper... Bottom line..don't waste your time and specially money...!! Rather go to pizza pizza and have a quick bite.."}
{"text":"Worst place. Food is extremely oily.. tempering is done in excess.. no good ambience, it's so dull and gloomy."}
{"text":"I Went for a office lunch buffet. Nice ambience and good food. Many choices , some great options on fish dishes. Goat curry was nice. The chicken was hard though. Naan and chicken tikka was personally most preferred. Also ordered mango lassi which was nice. The dessert selection was not great though. All in all they could do better."}
{"text":"We went for the 12buck all you can eat lunch and we was not that impressed.   All in all, for the both of us with two drinks it was $30 which is very cheap for a lunch downtown, unfortunately the price also resemble the food quality - cheap.   The food wasn't the worst it was just bland and I was put off eating the meat as my chicken was grey and fatty. I ended up playing it safe with rice and veggie dishes and pigging out on pakoras and fritters (bahjis)."}
