{"text":"Nice place to go out for a relaxed night with friends...you know, when you don't want to get all glitzed up or have to deal with strip crowds.  Nothing fancy, but good drinks and decent food.  And mini-bowling of course.  That mini-bowling got Roadrunner two stars off the bat."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger and a drink, but not great either.

To summarize the pros and cons of my experience:

Cons: 1. Sticky tables, 2. Dirty looking silver ware 3. Cool beer, not cold beer.

Pros: 1. Good Food, 2. Nice and attentive staff 3. Sports on TV 4. Free Wifi

I went to the Roadrunner off Buffalo and Washington around 4:10 on Saturday 4/6/13. I walked in and sat myself as a sign instructed and was promptly greeted by the Manager on duty. He brought a water and he took my order. I asked for the 1/3 lb Angus Burger and a draft Sam Adams Boston lager. I prefer draft instead of bottled because draft is colder, usually.

Looking around its what you would expect from a local's oriented sport bar. Dim, sticky and sports on TV. The table I sat at was pretty sticky and the silver ware, though clean, had a lot of water spots on it and looked a little gross. They had Wichita vs Louisiana on, no volume though which was ok with me because I think Charles Barkley's voice is annoying. Also they didn't have the captions on so I had no idea what anyone was saying, but I don't really care that much about it.

About another 3 minutes later I was brought a bottle of Sam Adams Boston lager instead of a draft by a very kind waitress. Even though I ordered a draft I didn't make a stink about it  because hey, beer! Taking another look around, the place was clean and if you like antique-ish looking cowboy stuff and garb this place is your mecca. There are cowboy hats, western style art and nick-nacks on the walls; even rusty looking horse shoe light fixtures. Also they had a sign that said free WiFi, which is all ways cool.

Now to the important stuff; the food and beer. The beer was cold but not cold enough, I'd honestly have to say it was cool. You know a beer is cold when there's condensation on the bottle, a good example is when you bring out a glass of ice water and there is moisture on the outside of the glass, that means its cold on the inside. To say the least it was cool, tasted warmer then my water and therefore like crap. Any savvy beer drinker knows, especially those that prefer Sam Adams, that a good beer temperature is between 39 and 45 degrees; mine tasted more like in the low to mid 50's. Yuck, but I still drank it because I'm a man, and a man never wastes beer. I ordered another hoping for a better one, but I was disappointed again.

The burger was good, very slightly pink even though I asked for well done, and was served on a perfectly toasted bun with too much lettuce and two slices of tomato. With half the lettuce off, the burger tasted excellent; the fries were also good and had just enough seasoning unlike other places that pile on the salt.

The price for a burger and two beers was $18.32 with tax. That's $4.50 a beer and $7.95 for the burger. Not great but not bad for Vegas, I'd say it's the average around here. If you go there Mon-Fri between 11am-3pm you can get the burger for $5.95."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Cowboy Western themed Roadrunner Saloon for about 5 years. This is one of those places that I seem to visit in streaks then stay away for awhile. This location is famous, at least from my observation, for very high employee turnover. When I see this then I know that its actually a management problem. In fact, the issues that send me away from here is usually some new management idea change that in my opinion sucks. The one thing that keeps me coming back despite my frustrations is that I do enjoy most of their food. 

So I stopped by here for lunch today around 2:30pm. I'm guessing that who ever is the current manager might be reading some of the reviews here on Yelp. Over the years the service has varied greatly at this location. However on this day, the service was great. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who took us to our table then went to get our waiter. This is in contrast to some of my past experiences. I've been sat at a table in the past then the hostess took off back to her station without ever informing the server that a party has been seated. I tend to pick off beat hours when things are slow so not informing a server can be an issue. I'm glad she took the time to do this because I was actually in somewhat of a hurry today. The server promptly came over took our drink orders. He quickly came back with the drinks then took our lunch order. I ordered the Texas Dip which is made with sliced top sirlion, jack cheese, creamy horseradish sauce served with a side of Au Jus and french fries. The sandwich was delicious! The Au Jus usually comes very salty to me however their version wasn't as salty so I did dip my sandwich into the au jus a few times. The fries to me were terrible. I had 2-3 then left the rest. They were some kind of terrible fancy cut frozen fries. If management does read this then please take a drive over to Whiskey Dick's and order their french fries. That's how french fries are suppose to be made. Homemade, fresh & delicious! I'd gladly pay a little more to have great fries. 


Just a little warning if you go for late night dinner. This happened about 2 years ago. I'm not sure if this is still the rule here. I won't be going back for late dinners to find out either. However in the past they sent their servers home early no matter how many customers may be seated at the tables. I had gone here many times for late night beers and food. So this change was a little surprising and frustrating. This is one of those changes that sent me away from here for awhile. We went in one night around 11:00pm to have some beers and grab some food at a table in the bar section. After about 10 minutes, the manager getting off duty stopped by to let us know they had just sent home the last server and that we would have to go to the bar to order food. I was like really? Why would you do that? There are a lot people sitting at the tables. I counted over 25 customers sitting at the tables at that moment. I asked the manager why? Can't you make money with this many customers sitting at your tables? Heck, I know our bill typically runs $50-60 alone. They did not seem to care that the place was busy. I told the manager that we would rather take our business that night to another establishment that is focused on keeping customers happy rather than saving $20-30 in employee costs. Heck, if I was managing this place I would have stayed myself and served all these tables until it slowed down."}
{"text":"I'd give it a negative one star, but that would still be too good a review for this dump. Said they could accommodate a party of 9. Gathered our whole family into two cars including my 93 year old Grandma and a 10 and 7 year old, drove all the way there, and rudely stated they couldn't seat us. It smelled like dead rodents, anyway. I've worked in a lot of restaurants and the stink of dead rodents is never a good sign, obv.  the staff LITERALLY cursed at us - why are they renovating? Just demolish it. Gross."}
{"text":"Nothing special. They have quite a few TVs that are great to watch the games. Happy hour is 3p to 6p. Other than that, food and drinks are pricey. Food is okay. They have a pool table which is also nice. Waitress shorted me on my change from my check so she didn't get a tip."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good vodka. Good nachos. Fun atmosphere.  They need a bigger parking lot though. Lots of folks parked in the gravel."}
{"text":"Hostility from various cast members towards my 11 member group. Does not allow Vaping , yet their smoking section is a few feet from the non smoking section and you can smell the smoke from the farthest point of the non smoking section. We were watched the whole time as if we were criminals. Very very unpleasant experience. Last time we come here!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place several times and when my family came in for a visit we went there for dinner. The place has great ambiance, great outdoor patio, two little bowling lanes, pool table and foosball table. Food was great, good music ( no country), service was slow, but the GM introduced himself and we overlooked this. We went back for breakfast the next day. There was two other tables aside from us. Once the waitress took our order we never saw her again. We had to go to the bartender to ask for a refill on coffee, food was delivered and then we had to wait and ask the bartender for silverware. We then had to ask the bartender for the check. Never got another refill on coffee or other drinks, never asked how food was etc and this took over an hour. The rating is based on ambiance and food. It's truly a shame that the staff is so poor because this place could be 5 stars easy. I'm sure if you went to the bar just to drink you would have a good time. Also the menu online is different from menu in restaurant, so don't pick out what you want from online menu because they'll price it item by item."}
{"text":"We have been to the Roadrunner 2 times using a groupons. On the 1st visit Mr. had the Texas dip sandwich and I had the mac n cheese with a salad.. both items were tasty and good. On our 2nd visit Mr. had the carne asada burrito and I had the vaquero steak salad.  Again both lunches were good.  We would have never ordered what we did because of the price and only did so because of the groupons.  Our server was prompt at refilling our ice teas (which to us is very important too).  We will go back again to try the lunch specials..  we love the decor of the place and only the dining room was busy at the lunch hour."}
{"text":"i visit this location often. the staff is helpful and generally very attentive.

my favorite salad has recently changed from a chop salad to a regular cut for the lettuce which is a little disappointing, but nothing a knife doesn't fix.

i enjoy my meal every time"}
{"text":"Quick Review: Good food, good drinks, big TV's, open 24 hours.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, don't forget the corn bread muffins.

No reviews yet?  Well, I'll start.  Road Runner's is actually several different restaurant operating under the same roof.  During the day, it's a casual family restaurant, serving western-themed American fare at moderate prices.  During weekends, it's a sports bar.  After 10 pm, it's a lounge populated primarily by twenty-somethings and the occasional video poker player.  Despite its identity crisis, it does all of these things pretty damn well.  The food is very, very good.  The complimentary corn bread muffins that they serve during dinner are so good they could probably charge for them (but I hope they never do).  The BBQ Tri Tips are my personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

The late night menu is more limited.  It's your typical bar food - burgers, nachos, quesidillas, but it also includes breakfast.  Speaking of late night, the crowd can be very unpredictable at Road Runner's after 10 pm.  You never quite know who's going to show up.  It can be hotel employees, slackers, rockers, punkers, emo's, jocks, frat boys, preppies, losers, winners, Jets, Sharks.  I've pretty much seen them all there.  You can go to Roadrunner's for almost any occasion and come out pretty satisfied.

Update: Downgraded from 4 stars to 3 stars.  Not sure what's going on with Road Runner.  The quality of their food has definitely dipped in the past year or two.  It's definitely not as tasty as before."}
{"text":"New remodel.  Great outdoor patio area. Poor service.  Should invest in people vs building materials.   Currently six tables in place occupied and the two waitresses can find a table.  Sad."}
{"text":"Eh food is not that great for the price you pay...expensive bar food in my opinion. However, the entertainment is so worth it. You can enjoy mini-bowling, golden tee/buck hunter, punching bag game and pool while enjoying the tunes on the jukebox. Always good times watching drunk guys compete against each other and see how hard they can hit the punching bag. If you feel like chilling and enjoying cocktails then sit the near the bar and watch tvs or enjoy their relaxing patio with fire pits."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Chill atmosphere.  Lance is by far the coolest bartender ive met in a very long time. Would recommend for sure"}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Roadrunner for the Denver Broncos game!  The place is so cute and inviting. The service was great!! Everyone is so friendly!  The food was really good!  Everything we ordered was awesome!  We definitely will be going back!"}

The food came out quick was really delicious. The garlic wings are O so savory! Can't wait to come back to this amazing place!"}
{"text":"Why can't you give negative stars for a review?

I came here on a Monday night with my fiancee and two co-workers. The waitress seemed nice enough, although it took forever to get our food. But by the end of the night, and one too many beers later, our tab was suddenly over $200. WAY over. Are you kidding me?!?

We begrudgingly shelled out our money, and even left a sizable tip. 

So imagine how thrilled I was when I woke up two days later to a text from my bank (Thank god for Chase Mobile) informing me of a $64.14 charge that overdrew my account. Due to that charge and the overdraft, my paycheck that I had deposited the previous night did not clear. I went directly to Roadrunner and informed them of their mistake, and the manager had the audacity to tell me \"it was not their fault, and that it was the bank's fault.\"

WHAT?!?

I proceeded to call my bank who, of course, let me know that the charge was in fact from Roadrunner and that they could cancel the still pending charge at any time. My fiancee and I made ANOTHER trip back to Roadrunner, and informed the manager of this, and he still refused, saying that they were in no way at fault.

I'm now having to file through the fraud department at my bank, and god knows when I'll get my money back, not to mention the fact that my account is now in limbo. &%$# this place. Great food, ok beer, horrible prices, even worse service."}
{"text":"I had a small group meeting here mid-afternoon and even though we didn't order much, we had fantastic service!  Of course we left a hefty tip :)
The staff is super awesome, friendly and accommodating!  That counts for a lot in my book."}
{"text":"I was invited to meet my friend here for a short meeting and maybe something to eat. The place is a dump, it serves food and alcohol the local law is they are not allowed to have smoking in doors however if you are a smoker this is your ILLEGAL DREAM HEAVEN.

 Ordered their #1 menu item the BBQ Cheeseburger with bacon. I am up at 4am this morning with cramps and my face is numb due to food poisoning.

 If you are a chain smoker/future cancer patient or love horrible food this is THE PLACE for you!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the last of the Roadrunners in town. There is a restaurant part and this is where we had lunch.  Their food menu is one page and it works has something for everyone.  We had some nachos with fresh salsa , chicken fried steak with corn and mashed potatoes and the club sandwich.  All the food was delicious and hit the spot!  Waitress (Kristen) was super nice/friendly and kept everything topped off and clean; THANK YOU! 12-31-14"}
{"text":"A good place to go for bar food while watching a football game.  Some good specials but since we had a groupon we splurged for dinner.  There were two of us and we got the full rack of ribs and some apps.

They (without us even asking!) split the ribs into two portions and served them to us on two plates, each with fries and slaw!  Very cool.  The ribs were tender, meat slid right off the bone.  Servers refilled our sodas frequently!

I kinda thought the Mac and cheese app was \"meh\" but my gf loved the popcorn shrimp (which comes in a hot wing sauce with bleu cheese crumbles)"}
{"text":"Don't order the ribs!! Awful! They're fatty and tough, without much flavor. I hate for my first review to be a bad one, but oh well..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Roadrunner for a few years now.   I've come to expect good food, big portions and decent service.  
This was one of the best places in town for a good pulled pork sandwich. Sadly, this is changing for the worse...  The experience started out awkward...when we walked in on a Saturday afternoon, there was a big sign in front that advertised half price apps.  The manager who seated us affirmed this special was going on at the moment.  We made our food decisions based on the specials and started to place our order with the waitress.  I told my girlfriend to go ahead and order the nachos since they were half price.  The waitress quickly interjected by telling us only a few of the apps were half price.  The sign in front did not mention that  it only applied to selected items in the appetizers section...this was deceiving.  I told our server to just forget the nachos and just stick to the main courses and she obliged in a less then friendly manor.  
My girl ordered the sliders, which were half price and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. When the dishes were were served, I thought someone was playing a practical joke on me.  My $9.00 pulled pork sandwich was almost the same size as one of the 3 sliders!!  Even the portion of fries were skimpy.  I'd estimate the size of the sandwich at about half of what it use to be.  
We weren't asked how the food was until long after I had finished the whole dish (didn't take long considering it was only about 4-5 bite sizes!!).  I told her I was surprised and disappointed about the portion size and she offered to get a manager...I took her up on it and within 5 min the manager came to our table.  I told him about the portion issue and he actually agreed that the portion was recently reduced, but found it hard to believe it was half the size.  He was polite and did offer us more food on the house.  I got another side order of fries and waited for the bill.  At this point our server became downright cold and it was obvious she just wanted us out.  She even became irritated I wanted change.  I quickly settled up and left ASAP.  I doubt I'll ever come back  and by the looks of some of the other recent reviews, it appears we're not the only ones who won't be back."}
{"text":"So I'm not really a yelp reviewer.... but I just had to. I just love the graveyard guy Chris. He actually knows how to make a decent drink. You definitely have to ask him to make you one their signature raspberry lemon drops!"}
{"text":"Hands down worst service that I have ever experienced. Took about 20 minutes to get soup, not even mediocre soup at that. The order was wrong, our server offered to change it but I was so hungry that I just said it was ok. She looked at me and said, \"it's not a big deal.\" Go back to training and learn what not to say to guests!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean place,  big screen tv's great, nice atmosphere, good prices, the asada taco salad was not good ( beans where too salty and too many ), I will go back to try them again, the place is great!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for a late night snack... carna asada flatbread & a stella~!I love the Western theme...they didsuch a good job! The outside patio w/ fire and a swing is quite romantic too (^^) 

+one lane bowling
+pool table"}
{"text":"I had a bacon, cheese burger.  It was average bar food.   The have decent selection of draft beers.  Outdoors patio is nice, includes TVs, fire pit, even a swing.  Metal tables were kinda wobbly.  Great venue for a big group!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! Bar is fun (wish it was more of a scene but maybe I just don't now the fun nights), food is good - bar food done right!  My fries were cold and under cooked - don't mess with a girls' french fries but burger was awesome (medium rare - yum!). Entrainment, karaoke and games - all fun! Servers were nice and efficent too.

It was an awkward night when my bf and I walked in and out of three different places in the area before finally settling into the comfy, overstuffed, pleather chairs in the bar area at Roadrunner.  We wanted: a few (4 each) wheat beers, to watch some game on TV and to eat something delicious for $50. We were two little pigs and this was the just right spot.  I have an aversion to chains, usually, but I was starting to get why we have them - the local spots could not deliver.    

I had been before just to drink but never had the food - glad we decided to try.  They consider themselves bbq but I wouldn't suggest if you take bbq too seriously - we don't. Large tvs over the bar but more atmosphere then the typical sports bar. Dim, loud (pop that night), and chill without being cheap - no peanuts on the floor, decor is fun, and someone cleans the bathrooms!! 

I saw 3 teenage girls waiting around when we walked in and was sure I was gonna end up having to be a bitch screaming across the place to ask for water for the 20th time (Im sure you know the feeling).  Fortunately, it was not a problem, they were attentive but didn't hoover.  Boyfriend had a brisket and chicken combo. We were famished from are wanderings but I am pretty sure he would have enjoyed it no matter the mashed potatoes especially. Someone in the kitchen makes them from scratch and I appreciate them! I love dressing on everything and there ranch, honey mustard, and vinaigrette were all good.  

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Heavy food! We've been going here on and off for some years, but last night's meal was really disappointing. Their food would be quite good (at the right price), if they weren't so heavy-handed with the fat. My lovely broccoli and carrots were grease sponges, the mashed potatoes had that \"too-much-fat\" mouthfeel. The creamed spinach was basically cream cheese with some spinach stirred in. Really a shame, because the filet mignon I had was really quite tasty, and everything else would have been too, if it hadn't been so heavy. Lighten up, Roadrunner, and maybe your customers will come back!"}
{"text":"I was probably a bit drunk when I bought a Groupon to Roadrunner.  I've driven past this place at least 1,000 times and thought it looked like redneck central.

Turns out, it's a harmless little sports bar with Western flair and enormous t.v. screens.  Very cowboy chic.  Yee haw?

Anyways, the food is okkkaaay.  We ordered the chili, a wedge salad, and a cowboy bbq meal.  The chili was a bit boring.  Not spicy at all.  It did taste homemade, not canned, so they get points for that.  The wedge salad was your typical wedge salad.  They didn't screw it up (which would be difficult).

The bbq was meh.  Our plate came with chicken, beef brisket and ribs ($17.99). The meat was unfortunately dry and not that flavorful.  In fact, it was apparent they just poured bbq sauce on top of everything after plating.  I wouldn't order this again. Bad cowboys!

 I was torn between giving this place 2 and 3 stars but the service was fast and friendly and I kind of enjoyed the atmosphere.  I'm not very country but I'd probably come back for their drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Roadrunner is usually a cool place. Last time I was there the bartender was too busy talking to his buddies to check on us. To top it off a Blue Moon is $6.75. Now I am not a cheap person but when a drink is just about more if not more money than an appetizer then there is a problem. I know it's not a domestic beer but seriously? An off the strip local bar charging $6.75 for a pint of beer is insane. To top it off I asked the bartender if they had any late night (midnight) drink specials and he said they have a Coors Light special, pints are $3.00, however they are out of Coors Light. You'd think he would have been able to substitute or something. I'm just saying, it's a crap economy and they aren't doing shit. Come on! Help a brotha out! Unemployed poor people want to drink too!!"}
{"text":"Great beer and Mac-n-cheese but extremely rude staff...beer and Mac aren't that good and I'll take my business elsewhere next time!"}
{"text":"Rudest  help  and  not  good  food!   Fairly  nice  atmosphere , but  after  a few  visits,  we  would  never  go  there  again."}
{"text":"I have been eating and enjoying a few adult beverages at this saloon since 2001.  It had the best waitresses, and the food was amazing..... And then a corporation purchased the bar a few years ago.  The draft beers shrunk in size, as did the food portions.  The good waitresses all left, and now it is hit or miss with the new staff.  The prices have all inflated, but the taste is not near as good as it was before the corporation came in.  

We used to eat there 2-3 times per week, and I woujld bring every guest from out of town there.  Now I eat there twice a year, only when forced by a friend that is visiting from out of state, and only when I can't convince them that the experience is not the same.  After expensive, smaller drinks and food, less tasty food, and less friendly waitresses, my friends agree and do not want to return either.

As a side note to RoadRunner.... Hire Roxy or Keisha back as a manager, and have them train the staff.  Get away from cheaper food (your salsa tastes like BBQ sauce with tomato sauce, and your ranch is watered down).  Go back to the way it was before the corporation took over."}
{"text":"Love this place. The kitchen is currently down but they are extremely accommodating and the bartenders go above and beyond. Sandy is the best!!! They even called and ordered food for us. It is clean and comfortable. Very impressed on all counts."}

{"text":"As a Broncos fan I watch Football here every Sunday. But I'm not in love with the place service not so good Prices way to high for what you get. Since it is aBronos bar I wish it was better"}
{"text":"Pool, Mini-bowling, Golden Tee, good value, 24 hours, cowboy stuff....


I haven't eaten at this Western-themed tavern, but for all the reasons mentioned above, it's a great spot to enjoy some drinks.  

The bar tender was attentive enough, and the staff was very friendly.  I would absolutely come back, and you should too."}
{"text":"The food is ok, that's what the star is for but the service is really bad.. This waiter we had was so bland and no personality at all. Never smiled, not even cracked or forced one. Wish i got his name. He has dark hair and a lil mustache or something. Never even checked on us if we're ok or if we needed anything else. Just took our orders, gave us the food, then the bill. Never going back to this place. Horrible."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about this place is that at least we had a Groupon. The service was slow & not sure who are server even was. There were 3 of us. I had the nachos & they were the most flavorless nachos I've ever had. My grandfather ordered ribs but they didn't have any. It was lunch time so I have no idea how they could be out. He got the pulled pork instead & our friend got the pulled pork as well. The fries that came with the pulled pork were still hard & not cooked all the way through. They had some flavor & I think they could have been really good had they been properly fried. My grandfather said the pulled pork didn't have a lot of flavor & the buns were so soggy that they couldn't pick them up to eat the sandwich . The BBQ sauce was too sweet & the pork lacked flavor. The cole slaw was flavorless soggy cabbage. Had someone come to check on us soon after the food was delivered we would have sent the food back. Definitely will not go back nor recommend. It's not even worth the 1 star I had to leave."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Which is why I love the Roadrunner Saloon. 

I first started coming here as a Denver Broncos fan. Everyone knows the Broncos have the best fans, and the Roadrunner made Sundays very special. Drink specials, kickoff shots, cheerleading, raffles for prizes, etc. It is loud and crazy and this upcoming season should be better than ever!

Ok, back to the review... I found a Groupon, $15 for $30. Already that's a steal, considering most of it could be spend getting liquored up. The fine print stated that 1 food item needed to be purchased. Perfect, side of fries and shots all around. Well, actually, I was more interested in trying the food. So we spend all 30.00 on grub.

Here's the breakdown:
Menu- it all looked interesting. Keep in mind this is bar food, no matter how they try to sell it. If you can remember that, you'll be fine.

Started off with the Jalapeño bottlecaps, fried pickles, and JD Whiskey Chili.
The jalapeños  were just spicy enough, went great with ranch. Fried pickles were actually great, with a big beer batter and ranch. Real good.
The chili was ok too. Not the 5 alarm of your dreams, but better than Stagg in a can. It was tasty. Would I get it again? Maybe. I think I'm somewhat of a chili snob, but that shouldn't affect my judgement here. Lets just say for bar chili I've had so much worse. you might really enjoy it. Give it a shot, they sell it by the cup, you just have to ask.

Then we tried the turkey melt and the burger with bacon. The turkey met was wicked awesome. Bread perfectly buttered and toasted, nice hot deli turkey with avocado and mayo. It was great. I ate most of it, Sarie being full after the apps. I'd recommend the turkey melt over anything else I've had there. Im getting hungry just thinking about it.
The burger wasn't great. And that sucks, because why go get a beer in a place that can't make a decent burger? What was so bad about it, you may ask? Well, the bacon was, shall we say, less than inspired. Thin and dry; not the best look for bacon. The bun, however, was soaked through. Not the best look for a bun. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium but lacked flavor and wasn't seasoned, as far as I could tell. The fries were limp and a little cold.

BUT for $15 dollars it was a steal. That sandwich was great! The staff and managers are always in a good mood and do a really good job. So for bar food, it's great. Just go in with accurate expectations."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on 3/11/2010.

I took some friends, my parents and my 2 year old.  Everyone was really nice...but they didn't bring us a kids menu and we had to ask twice to get it.
My friends steak was good but quite small for a 9 oz portion.  Mine was cooked perfectly and came with a side of fire roasted corn which was excellent.  

The atmosphere is fun, and loud enough to bring a 2 year old to and not worry about the neighboring diners.  I can have a drink that is good, while in a family atmosphere.  
We really enjoyed it and will be back"}
{"text":"The lay-out of the place is cool. The menu is nice, and good beer selection. However, service was SO slow.  Not any place I'd get too excited about going back to."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the wait staff here is hit or miss. The last time we went, our waitress pretty much ignored us after our food was delivered. It took forever to get a refill or ranch for our fries. I could understand it if there were other diners but we were the only customers in the restaurant. She barely acknowledged us until we asked for the check. I really like the food here but with service like that, it makes you think twice before you come back. I hope our next experience is a better one."}
{"text":"Perfect place to take family or friends.  Full service bar. Everything in on the menu is home made.  Huge portions. Couldn't eat all my food again so big doggie box to go came home.  Dessert is a must. I always eat it first----I can bring my dinner home and eat it later.  Food server told us all about Happy Hour menu. Walking Tacos are $4. Lots of other good stuff. Good place for couples or family."}
{"text":"Love the country vibe this place has.  Have been here twice and the wait staff was helpful and friendly.

Love the fried pickles and had some other good food too.   Plan to come again for the Video Poker and Happy hour when I have time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The manager took our order and then he disappeared... When the cocktail waitress came to deliver our nachos (which took 20 min), my bf asked if he could have another beer and she kinda went.. I guess.. Cause she wasn't taking care of us. She only had one table so it's not like she was busy. After that she would not even walk by us or make eye contact. Both me and my bf are in the service industry and were pretty upset about it. We understand when people are busy, but another thing is to not care. We cancelled our dinner order and asked for the check. The manager apologized and said he only had one cook and he was busy. We didn't care if the food was taking long but we never had a chance to order drinks. $40 for 2 beers, a martini, nachos and a cup of soup... never again."}
{"text":"What a great place!  I'm from Montana AND a Bronco's fan so the decor was right up my alley but its the food that won me over!  Every question I asked got the right answer: fresh, made in house, chipotle ranch!  
Bartenders Rock and they have a \"lottery\" that goes off randomly and gives up to $10,000 to registered players!  I cant wait for the next Broncos game at Roadrunners!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and just relax with a guest.  Kendra is a very attentive hostess and a pleasure to talk to.  I truly love this place and am trying something different each time I come!  The macaroni salad is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I had always thought this was more of a dive bar place, so imagine my surprise when it turns out to be a fairly nice bar/restaurant. The place was set up for Monday Night Football, but we were able to hold a conversation in the booths. The place was fairly empty. The drinks were good, the food was good (and with a good selection of items not deep-fried). I had the fish tacos and they were really good -- not heavily crusted and fried, but a light fried portion of fish on a crisp slaw. That could easily become a go-to menu item for me. Loved it. 

What really takes this down to 3 stars was the service. Our server was nice, but not helpful and she didn't know the beers. I see from another review that they had Crisp Apple -- my friend asked specifically about it and was told they didn't have anything apple. There were only 3 tables in use in the restaurant and we had a bit of trouble getting orders in, getting the check at the end, etc. Good thing we weren't in a rush. Nice enough place that we'll be back though. We liked the menu variety and the neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"Perfect bar to watch the Broncos!! Great fun, good drinks and atmosphere to watch football! BEST Bronco bar in Vegas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Nutty Boba has so many good healthy items, that its hard to name them all. They are the only licensed business to offer some of the products they carry. I will not tell you as its the same surprise I found out. Go in and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Good time here reasonable prices, nice staff they are doing a remodel rite now but still provide a great atmosphere! Had a couple of their different \"Cowboy Cocktails\" all were really good. I think it is a nice change to any other local bar/pub."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and went on a Tuesday evening. First impression when driving up was \"Ehh, I don't know about this...\" But walking inside, it is a really cool looking restaurant/bar. Probably a fun place to drink at, with a really nice outdoor patio area. However, I would never eat here again.
Lets start with the food. I started with a wedge salad, which was decent but I'm assured I cracked a filling on the rock-hard bacon bits. Then I got the grilled chicken club with avocado and crinkle fries. The fries were the highlight of the meal- Reminded me of my childhood, Hah. The top bun was rock hard and the bottom was a wet soggy mess. The chicken was as dry as ever and the avocado was mushy. The bacon, once again was hard and nasty. The club also comes with honey mustard, which I'm thankful I asked them to put it on the side because It tasted like cheap honey icing.
The service was decent. I think our server was fairly new because she seemed overwhelmed with only a couple tables. Refills, food, and the check was brought by another server. Overall, I was glad we didn't have to pay full price for the food."}
{"text":"The food was certainly good and so was the service. Unfortunately they informed us about a menu change by January 2015. 

I had some chicken tenders that had a good amount of driest and sauce to them. Everything went well but it's sad to know they're changing their usual style."}
{"text":"Very charming, western atmosphere and amazing food! Staff is very courteous and work as a team. When we went (Sat night), there was a private party outside as well as a few groups inside; however the service did not suffer! I got the fresh fish tacos and am now so full bc I could not stop eating them, they were so delic. Def one of our new hang outs!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a meat lovers pizza. It looked more like a dough lovers pizza. 4 pieces of pepperoni and some hamburger meat. The manager, Tim, took it back and made a disparaging comment about my team."}
{"text":"I go here alot. I love the bartenders **Jen and Jen** ;) They have had a turn around in employees the last few months so things are really starting to change. If you like a bar that has regulars there all the time this is a place for you. There are very talkative people that come in but then if you don't know anyone and you don't really like to be the one to go up and start talking then you might not like this place. I love the service i get I wish there machines would pay better as for i do gamble a lot there and i don't get anything back most of the time. The food is awesome. they have a area where you don't have to go into the bar part and you can go eat with your family. In the bar they do have a jukebox and 1 (ONE) pool table. they have golfing on the video games and 1 (one) little video game that is not gambling on the side if you want to play that!"}
{"text":"Super Bowl at the best bronco bar in Vegas. We always have the best time here! Thanks Tim and all the staff for creating this space to celebrate Broncos, and create fun memories with friends. Everyone here is a friend! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I must confess that my visit to Roadrunner is a bit of a blur.  I had been out all night with friends and lost my voice and went to Roadrunner with my brother to escape the strip and watch some football.  It was a quality bonding experience.  I remember the salads being good.  I remember that the Cal game wasn't on and I was basically told that it would not be put on for me because no one cared about that game.  Probably true.  I remember that I drank a beer in the hopes of curing my hangover.  I remember that didn't work.

11/05/07 Update:
Breakfast is good enough, but not fantastic.  Interesting menu with biscuit and gravy type things, but the biscuits are marginal, I warned you."}
{"text":"We have been going to Roadrunner for a while now, and decided we wanted to give a review. We had breakfast with the best oatmeal anywhere for a starter. Then we shared an omelet which was cooked perfectly. We were there to watch football and the TV ' s in the bar are huge, like being at the game. The restaurant is very cozy and we will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Yee Haw! I popped into this place with a couple friends when we said \"The basketball games are over, we are full, where to next?\" 

The Roadrunner is pretty cool. From the outside it just looks like a barn. I've driven by several times, and being new to town, I quickly judged this place and thought it looked a little lame.

But once I popped in, I saw they had some great happy hour beer specials, particularly for the late night crowd. 

Since I am on sobriety, I ordered a club soda and upon leaving, found out that it costs almost as much as a cocktail. REALLY? A Club Soda? WTF!? It should be free...or a dollar at most. Lost a star for that.

They have a mini-bowling alley, which is also fun. 

The food looked decent although we didn't partake. 

The booths are a bit creepy because they are lined with cowskin. They tend to poke you in the back, but some of  you guys might be in to that :)

Hmm....what else? Well, one last thing. The bathrooms were clean. This is a major plus.

Ok, that's it. Come here. Yadda Yadda Yadda. It's not bad. Not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"This review is solely on their breakfast.  I felt a solid 3 over the establishment's food until I tried their breakfast for a few weeks.  Woowee!

-  I'm never an oatmeal fan, but it has been good.
-  Biscuits are buttery and tasty
-  The potatoes that come with set breakfasts are addiction - crispy and well seasoned.

Conclusion:  Woo wee for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We were treated very poorly by the server \"\"Lisa\"\" when we went  to Road Runner around 7:00 pm on Thursday Oct. 10th. She took our order and said there was a special on the steak for $10.99 so my fiance ordered 2 of the specials and i ordered the salmon. She then asked if we had a group-on and we said yes then she started treating us very badly and had a terrible attitude! She never refilled our waters and I asked for 2 sides of vegetables instead of rice and my fiance asked for mushrooms instead of potatoes. My food came out 15 mins before my fiance's food and it was covered with rice, when i politely told her for all vegetables she gave me an attitude and took the plate back to the cook. Then my fiances plate came with potatoes which he specifically said he didn't want potatoes but he didn't complain, finally my food comes back out 15 mins after my fiances food then she just threw the bill on the table very rudely! When we got the bill the $10.99 specials she charged us $13.99 for and added an extra fee for the vegetables that was supposed to be included in our meal! Honestly I've never been treated so horribly at a restaurant in my entire life! We still tipped her even with how unprofessional she acted towards us. Oh then 4 days later looking over our bank statements Lisa charged our credit card twice! which we can pursue legally for unauthorized credit card charges.  Horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"Really bad golf Hot and smokey six dollar beers even if gaming place has nothing to offer"}
{"text":"I am glad I ended up here, because I was pleasantly surprised. After a 10 day stint with family on the east coast and practically Indian food everyday...I was ready for easy all-american food.  I wanted a simple steak and salad with ranch dressing, but I didn't want to spend alot like I normally would at a steakhouse.  To top it all off, my husband wanted to watch to watch football, it was Monday night.  Further we wanted to try a new place in our neighborhood, so we ended up at Roadrunner.

We walked in, and at first, I was off put by the smokiness, but there were not that many people given that it was a large place, so at the doorway, I decided it was fine...I was tired and hungry anyway.  Once I started to look around, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the establishment is, and the cozy outdoor space that includes a fire pit and some TVs.  While the country, southwestern? decor is not my preference, it was still cleanly done, so I didn't seem to mind so much.

Anyway, we were greeted by a very polite yet casual hostess and she let us sit where ever we liked since there were only two dining tables occupied at the time.  I was a bit hesitant by how empty it was, doubting the food was any good, if even edible. 

Going through the menu, I was surprised at the expanse of the food menu, given it was a \"saloon\".  They menu items were definitely were inspired by its Southwestern roots, although they had nice twists on regular \"All-American bar food.  The menu had something for everyone... burritos, fish, pasta, steaks, pizzas, salads, soups, burgers, and sandwiches. Prices hitting all sorts of I struck gold with a steak salad! 

So I ordered the steak salad and my husband ordered a burger with bacon and cheese.  We also ordered a couple of drinks.  He ordered a Guinness, but I was not impressed with the limited wine selection . I asked for a Sauv Blanc...they don't serve it.  So I asked for a Pinot Grigio, they usually have it but were all out, I went with merlot.  It was fine, probably should have not bothered since it was just labeled house wine, which tend to be pretty crappy just so they can increase their profit margins.  

My salad was well done, actually taking on a Mediterranean flair with Kalamata olives, feta, red onions, and grape tomatoes,  topped  with crispy fried onions on a bed of romaine with pan seared strip? steak.  The steak was plentiful and perfectly done, given I asked for it medium rare. That was impressive, not to mention tasty, since most steak salads offered by restaurants seem to just use any odds and ends for steak salad.  Whether they were or not, the crinkle cut fries looked like they were bought and just cooked.  However, my husband did eat them all without complaint.

The diverse menu obviously expresses the talent and passion of the chef (staff) in the kitchen, it is a shame that the wine offering does not compliment that.  I think Roadrunner is underrating its own potential.  The Saloon names is a bit offputting, but focusing on the southwestern flair has broader appeal. Roadrunner could expanded its target market, even showing off its menu.  It could appeal more to the nearby Summerlin neighborhood, which are searching for nice casual dining establishments. With a little more marketing Roadrunner could get the justice it deserves, but for now it is my little secret."}
{"text":"I looked up the menu online and it said they had ribs and beef brisket, so I got a BBQ hard-on.  Then I came in and I found that they've discontinued them there at that particular location.  So I ended up just trying the wings.  They were good, the kind that still tastes good even without any sauce on it (smoky flavor), but I'm minusing half a star for lack of imagination.  I'm going to try one of the other locations and see if I can get my BBQ on."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have visited Road Runner, the first was about 5 years ago.  My husband and I decided to give it another chance, as it was very late and we were hungry.  The menu was pretty small and there was only one bartender late night to serve us...And I still looked past it all in order to give them a second chance.  I usually don't take too much of an acount into small menus or slow service when it's late night.  My eggs and bacon were decent, my husband's sandwich was ok, and then....later that night....kaboom food poisoning.  Can't usually blame one place, but it was the only place we had eaten together in days, and the last meal I had was a frozen meal from the microwave, I'd say there's a pretty good chance the culprit was right there at road runner.  As if I needed an excuse not to go back.  Too bad, the location was great."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I initially went to the Henderson location, looking for good BBQ, only to see that they had discontinued that portion of their menu.  So I trekked all the way to this location only to find out why it wasn't very popular in the first place...

I got the cowboy plate with choice of three meats, so I wouldn't have to come back and sample anything:

1) The beef brisket was awful.  Hard and chewy.  Even though it was sliced thin, it somehow managed to resemble rubber.

2) The pork brisket tasted bad.  I don't know whether it was the sauce or the leftover pork they selected to make this.  Yuck.

3) The pork ribs were of the sparerib variety, which means it was full of meat but kind of tough and dry.  Definitely the star of the show, but I wouldn't call it the best by any stretch of the imagination.

So there we go.  Some of the worst BBQ I've tried in Vegas, and believe me, I've tried it all.  Never again.

If you do come here, stick with something simple like the wings...which still kind of taste dry, but at least they have the BBQ flavoring to them."}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new place to watch a game and grab lunch.  It just plain sucked.  Lots of great sports bars in Vegas.  This ain't one of them."}
{"text":"I first tried this place out because it's in the neighborhood and there was a groupon. Nice decorations, very clean and chill. The food is what keeps me going back, the fried pickles and the burgers are awesome. It's never too busy either which is kind of nice, unfortunately the service sucks. As I stated it's not busy so it's hard for me to understand the lack of service. I think almost every time I've been there the same person has helped me and her attitude sucks. Clearly this hasnt kept me from returning :)"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much since it was located near our somewhat out-of-the-way hotel and their vegetarian selections were super limited (no veggie burgers for these cowboys). However, the vibe was very warm and the service extremely prompt and attentive. 

We made a meal of fried pickles and nachos. The nachos, while not a complicated dish, were expertly prepared, meaning there was not a dry chip in the pie tin. They were not miserly with the toppings and there was none of that \"bottom of the chips were neglected by the beans/cheese\" syndrome that you often encounter when an amateur is running the chip station. 

My Long Island Iced Teas were quite strong too. Which is why I probably ate fried pickles and nachos before bed. I will probably do it all over again tonight.

There was also a delightful fire pit with a porch swing that allowed my companion and I a little time to think about the finer things in life."}
{"text":"The food and service was great.. had the fried pickles ! YUM !! Very good, better than Lucilles !  Had 5 reasonable lunch items, but limited choices.. need to add more.  The one thing that I would change is that sappy  country music, if you are going to play country play upbeat country and mix it up w some hot hits or something... 
All I heard the whole time I was eating... was someones dog died, wife left, house burnt down ..lol  DEPRESSING !"}
{"text":"I really used to enjoy coming here for an after work drink, as I like to play a little video poker, cowboy bowl, and the jukebox is quite alright. After last night, I will not be returning. For some reason or another, the graveyard bartender was ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. We've been there at least half a dozen times, so he possibly would slightly know our faces and that we tip well. He never came and offered us another drink, but offered the couple next to us another round. My gf and I are both bartenders, so we know how to tip. Perhaps neighboring Sedona will be our new bar of choice."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else has already stated: the decor is quite nice in a south-west cowboy themed neighborhood bar with a good selection of draft beers and liquors. I was actually impressed that they had Angry Orchard: Crisp Apple on tap. Don't really see it that often. 

Our waitress made a few recommendations but because i just came from work i wanted to try something that didnt sound like the portion size was going to be pathetically small. Ended up grabbing the Grilled Beef Tips with a cup of chili.

The grilled beef tips were decent. There wasnt that much of a bbq marinated beef taste or even a heavy smokey taste associated with the grilling. Overall everything was subtle in taste. The beef i requested medium-rare and what i received was medium which is understandable as i dont expect a practical way to cook such small chunks to perfection without having to pierce a thermometer in there every minute.

The sides were about average. Broccoli and carrots which were steamed or boiled or even microwaved tossed in some butter. The potatoes were REALLY buttery which in turn made them undeniably good if not fattening.

The chili was actually pretty damn good. Nice chunks of tomatoes and beef, had a really nice flavor that wasnt too bland or overpowering but just right. 

Overall i would come here again because it's out of the norm for what i'm used to in a hang out spot or bar. The bar is nicely stocked with a few times i specifically look out for because it's what i drink and there's activities such as darts and bowling for a more interactive dining/drinking experience.

{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 1 star is for the service. The bartender was attentive & the server Antonio was friendly. We went at about 9pm on Friday night, sat in the lounge ready to chow down, starving and ready for a good meal & a couple beers. The beer was great but the food was nearly inedible. The nachos were burned black, the carne asada was like beef jerky & the cheese was so burned we had to pick it off. We ordered an adult grilled cheese with Swiss & cheddar and grilled onions & bacon. It was a single slice of cheddar melted between two pieces of toast, and nothing else. We sent it back to be remade correctly & the \"cook\" opened the same sandwich & shoved in 2 pieces of old cold bacon & raw red onions in it, then sent it back. The server graciously removed that from our bill & comped a couple beers. This is unacceptable, this place used to be great & have great food. I highly recommend if you want a good meal made with care, don't go there. We paid our bill & went up the street to Steiners for a bomb home cooked meal at a great price."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm just having a bad day or something else but this place has the worst service. I walk in seat myself as I should. I have eye contact with at least two employees, no acknowledgement or ask if I need a menu. I should have just went to Carl's Jr. across the street."}
{"text":"Went here tonight cause I was having a hankerin' for fried pickles.  Its really the only reason we go here rather than other similar places. 

So we order our drinks (they were out of iced tea, which is what I drink...hot water + teabags + a few mins + ice = iced tea. Easy peasey folks).  Got out ammended drink order along with fried pickles. 

The pickles were nice and hot and crispy but even though I'm a spice addict drowning pickles (already salty since the literally live their entire pickle life swimming in brine) and then giving them a heavy handed seasoned salt blizzard wakes them almost too salty to be edible, yay for the dippin' sauce. 

Once the pickles were delivered I'm pretty sure the staff was being abducted by aliens cause there was no one to be found.  Almost 45 mins later our food arrived. He had the whiskey chili (pretty sure they have to just warm that up if its not already bubbling away in a chili pot.  

I ordered a turkey melt. It was supposed to be turkey, pepper jack cheese,  bacon, and avocado on GRILLED sourdough bread.  As far as restaurant vittles go a sandwich should be a no brainer.  My grilled/toasted sourdough had absolutely no color on it. The bottom was so soggy and the fried so limp and cold I am almost positive that my plate had spent a long time under the heat lamp (remember thay 45 mins we waited for a sandwich and a bowl of chili?) On top of that there were two small super thin pieces of bacon and two thinly sliced avocado.  The pepper jack had no pep. My fries were sad. 

All in all pickles were ok, he liked his chili, my sandwich was a total let down.  The service was great when she was actually talking to us but my boyfriend literally had to hunt her down outside to ask for our check.  And instead of bringing it right away...ten mins later when she was still not there I was sent to the car because the booth was uncomfortable.  All he had to do was get a box and sign his receipt...20 mins later he walked out. 

I love fried pickles but if you cant get a sandwich right and keep it on the heat lamp when the place isn't busy, we will take our money to a place who deserves it from great food and amazing service. 

Guess we will have to get our pickle fix at Hooters now."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner want to have a steak.  The mash potatoes and salad were good, but the steak was tough and of low quality..  The price of the food didn't match the quality of the food"}
{"text":"The best thing about this bar and restaurant is the location. Anyone that lives on the east side can meet here, its right off the freeway and easy to get to. i will admit, the friday night bar scene is not what I'm reviewing here, its the five am breakfast where nobody is in there!!! I love it that you can get nacho's or eggs all night long. The bartenders are nice and with there being so many gaming bars around, this one has stood the test of time. I wouldn't go durring a sporting event due to the space issue, but great for a junk food dinner or early breakfast."}
{"text":"To start - they allow smoking right where you are eating.  Will not return just for this reason.  When we inquired about this they said \"Nothing we can do about it\"??

The bartenders/servers where all very nice.  We had the chili / not bad, nachos / terrible! 
Not many people there on a friday night...ummm, should have told us something."}
{"text":"One of my \"go-to\" places, especially late night!  The mac and cheese is the best and I also really like the chicken quesadilla-it has corn kernals and beans in it too.  The graveyard bartenders(Mike and Alex) rock my socks off!  There's karaoke on Thursday nights.  In fact, it's Thursday!  Better get over there...haha"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood bar. Relaxed atmosphere with a country kick. Pitcher beer, good food, and reasonable prices. They also serve a pretty decent breakfast as well. Best of all....they're a Denver.Bronco's bar during football season."}
{"text":"This place can be fun...if you make it fun. Mediocre waitstaff, mediocre food. 

I have some good memories here, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  
Again, it's not bad, but there are tons of better options!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this bar before I started playing Kickball, and I had never been on a non-Wednesday night until somewhat recently.  Have gambled and won (hit a royal!) so it's definitely possible to win here :)  I love their gaming promos every week, bartenders are very friendly, and food is delicious.  Haven't had too much of a variety (I find something I like and stick with it!) but the steak nachos are AWESOME and the filet is delicious - it comes with steak fries and an amazing little spinach dip thingy that you have to try.

Good ambiance, great for Broncos fans (this is the place to be when the Broncos have a major game!  Broncos fans are crazy!), and pretty good specials.  Always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Breakfast experience -- 4/5
So, for those that don't know, this is probably one of the best breakfast specials in town.  For $1.99 you get two eggs however you want, two slices of toast (or an English muffin), two slices of bacon (or sausage) and home fries.

And it is ALL delicious.  I've ordered a couple of different combinations and I have some custom requests (eggs fried over hard, bacon extra crispy, home fries extra crispy) and it always comes out correct.

So, why 4 out of 5?  Sometimes the service can be godawful slow in the mornings... and I don't mean the chef.  When you're trying to get in and get out, that can prove to be a challenge.

Lunch experience -- 5/5
5 for $5.95 deal offers a 1/3 lb burger+fries, chicken Caesar salad, a mini pizza and two other things that I can't remember.  I got the burger and honestly, from the other reviews, I didn't really expect too much.

It's really, really tasty.  Beats going to any fast food joint, and it's a good price point.  Also, great service during lunch.  I guess people working in a bar at 8am simply don't want to be there... go figure.  -:P

I've also tried their spinach & artichoke dip here -- absolutely fabulous, and I am SO picky about my spinach & artichoke dip.  My friend raves about the macaroni and cheese but I have yet to try that one out.  -:)"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying- ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE.  It is something you will not ever regret doing.  My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it.

We only go to the Roadrunner Saloon about once a year.  It has been our Christmas dinner tradition for the past 3 years, oddly enough.  I'm not sure why we don't go more often... the service and food are always great.  The cowboy themed decor and menu are intriguing and I especially love the way the ceiling is painted.  My personal favorite is the Grilled Turkey Melt.  It is the perfect combination of crunchy, melty and spicy goodness.  

I think that I will definitely have to return a few more times this year to try out some of their other delicious items!"}
{"text":"Went here to watch the last NBA Finals game and I'm glad I did since I was rooting for the Spurs.  Being that it's a country bar, a lot of other Spurs fans were there so it was a good time cheering on the team.

It got pretty busy so our server, Jamie, was a little slow.  However, she was super friendly and since we were staying until the end of the game, it wasn't a nuisance that she was behind.  Plus, the manager was constantly walking around and checking on the tables which is a change from other places I've been where the manager just stands and does nothing.

I look forward to going there again since I didn't get to try the cowboy bowling they had.  Plus, since the filet mignon was incredibly good, I'll get that as well."}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to watch Bronco's game and Vegas Yelp pointed me to this saloon and I'm glad they did. Definitely a cowboy bar. Decorated with really cool cowboy decor  but not too over whelming. 
It's has a lower bar area with pool tables and table bowling. Really cool bar stools and tables with huge booths. Upper area has nice size booths and tables for families and good views of the TVs above the bar. Ceilings got an outdoor look with clouds and lighting with very decorative with horses all the way around. 

We started with some house chili and mac n cheese. Both were good but we prefer the mac n cheese.  Oana had wedge salad and they forgot the bacon, took about ten minute to finally get the bacon. Alex had huge nachos and Jacob and I shared a huge full portion of ribs. Which were tender and sauce was good. We finished off with the Apple crisp, but was more apple than crisp. Mostly apples heated on a cast iron pan with tiny bit of crumb on top, very tiny bit, still good but not what you expect. 
 
Over all very happy we found this place. They do show every Denver Broncos game on Denver's local channel. I will be back probably in September to see the opener against Pittsburgh (my other favorite team) another win - win for me. Thanks to all the Vegas Yelper's for all the in put not just for this place but also for pizza places. Which we found an awesome place for crispy Italian pizza."}
{"text":"Off the top, my favorite dish here is the potato soup - just amazing. And don't forget sliders while you're at it. 
For the place itself, while it's not the newest bar, I love the grungy western atmospheric vibe it gives. Walking in, you'll see they have a pool table setup, miniature bowling, a jukebox, and sometimes karaoke. One of my favorite locations though, would have to be outside. They have the perfect little patio, complete with bonfires, and my friends and I love to come in and make smores during the cool nights. Did I mention they have a swing??
Roadrunner is also perfect for gambling, and for football season. Place is normally packed then. Wednesday nights, the bar is full of kickball players, so watch out.
Besides all that, Scotty is my favorite bartender, and Travis is my favorite server. Wait, no favorites? That's okay - all the servers are good at what they do. Come on in and check it out!"}
{"text":"I love the decor here.
they even have an antique bowling alley (very cool)

ordered
Spanish dip
whiskey chili
medium rare hamburger
steak salad

everything taste great. will be back again."}
{"text":"I was entirely disappointed in this place. I took a date here for dinner and the service was simply atrocious, food and drinks took forever to come out, and the food was subpar at best. This seems like a great place to watch sports as there are several big screen televisions, nice big bar, but for dinner, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from Roadrunner for about 6 years but had never ventured in until a couple of days ago after having bought a Groupon. We didn't end up using it as we were there during happy hour and our dinner of Cowboy Poppers (Jalapenos stuffed with cheese and pulled pork), Sliders, Chicken Wings, a Bud Light, and a Sprite was well under our $30 Groupon. The food was pretty decent. I liked the filling in the poppers but the breading could use some work. The sliders were cooked past the medium I had requested but still pretty good. The chicken wings were chicken wings.

Next time I think I'll try the Southwest fried pickles and the pulled pork sandwich. And I think I'll bring my parents so the tab exceeds the Groupon."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i come here often, because we like the food and the prices aren't bad at all. the atmosphere is nice and laid back as well. unfortunately, the service is kind of hit or miss.

we had a really amazing waitress the last two times we went there. she was friendly, attentive and just overall gave us pretty much a 5 star experience! (edit: her name is ladonna! ask for her!)

however, there have also been several times we've gone there, or i've been there with friends and we've had bitchy servers who take forever to do something that should take like 2 minutes and like to stand around talking to their friends instead of doing their job. there's no reason for us to wait half an hour for the check or our drinks to not be refilled when we are the only table there."}
{"text":"Great country bar! 

I love the atmosphere , probably more than any other bar in Vegas. It's very authentic and tastefully decorated. 

Unfortunately, the food I've tried hasn't been great, but I'd rather come here to drink anyway. They have reasonable prices and a few good appetizer options to soak up the booze. Everyone that works here is super friendly. 

I wish they played more country music, and I wish they had a mechanical bull! 

I will return many, many times!

ps.

The jalapeno poppers made me cry my eyes out."}
{"text":"So below average.   Drinks were weak and menu was uninspired and the portions small.

There is nothing special about this location and the food was disappointing.  I had their Texas Dip which is your basic french dip.   Small roll that became soggy quickly even before the dip, the roll was issue.  The beef as fine but the fries were not crisp or even that hot.

The service was fine, we had a good waitress who was attentive but she could not make the experience better.  It really bothered me that while the three of us had 8 drinks and none of them had any real kick and that was for 3 long island ice teas and 5 Alabama Slammers, both should have been stronger.

Go just down the block to a Steiners for a better experience."}
{"text":"A generous 2 Stars at that!

Just came back her with a group of friends because of its location.  This was not the first time that they were not that busy but still unable to deliver quality service.  We had almost 2 hours available to us before we needed to leave...It took the entire time.

The food was fine...typical bar items.  There were five of us all eating different things (and ordering soups or salads as well) and while no one had any major complaints about the food everyone agreed that we need to drive a little farther next time to eat something worth remembering.

It doesn't matter if you sit in the bar or in the non-smoking side, if someone is smoking the whole place smells like smoke...in this case to the point that someone else who was not with is commented on it afterwards.

You need an ulterior motive than food to come here."}
{"text":"my girl friend and I stopped in cause its close, we sat in the bar and had drinks and ordered something to eat, I had a chicken club sandwich it came on a bun thought it would be on bread and quartered but no, tasted ok but was not what I had expected my girl friend had turkey club sandwich came on bread but same thing not what she expected, the fry's were like something frozen and heated up! not good, the waitress was friendly and seemed ok, to top it off my girlfriend left her wallet in the booth where we sat , when we got home we called to see if anyone turned it in they said yes, when we went back in to get it we noticed the $34.00's in it was gone, I told the waitress and  she had a very guilty attitude and pretty much could care less !! also there prices are high for what you get which is not very good, all in all I think these people are dishonest , we would not recommend this place at all!! I give it a big zero rating, if a manager there reads this I would be weary of your employee's, some one there is a thief."}
{"text":"If you want a fun, relaxing evening with a few different things to do, the Roadrunner on Eastern and Pebble holds a lot more than it looks like.  First of all, for a bar and grill type atmosphere, their food ain't too bad.  I could seriously eat breakfast there every day.  You know, if I wanted to get ginormously humongo. 

The bar area can get crowded with people lounging in the comfortable seats watching whatever game \"The Game\" happens to be that night.  That's OK, because that leaves the pool tables open.  And if they're occupied?  There's mini bowling.  

Yes.

Mini-bowling.

I'd never seen such a thing, but for something like $2 per person per game, you get to launch mini bowling balls down a mini alley into a bunch of mini pins on strings.  I love - LOVE - mini anything:  travel size toiletries, baby corn, Mini Kiss.  This tiny bowling about put me on adorable adoration overload, but not before I'd had a few cocktails and played a few frames.

If they would serve me breakfast while I sat on the lane, I would probably just expire from glee."}
{"text":"Bar food that's not that bad.  
Roaring fire, overly sweet drinks, huge desserts.  

My Aunt brought a friend of hers and her friend's Grandson here.  

If you're looking for a spacious place with dim lights to play pool, darts, and throw back a few beers in the neighborhood this isn't a bad spot. The waitress was a bit slow, but very nice.  

If you happened to drink too much in this place the food wouldn't be bad if you had no other choice than to eat.  My uncle had the pulled pork sandwich, my Aunt had their potato soup, the youngin' had a full rack of ribs, and I think I saw some sliders on another plate.  The brownie Sunday was warm and delicious!

Date Rating: 3
Pick up Scale: N/A almost empty when we came here at 6 pm.  A party of 13 came in as we were leaving.

Strong Suggestion: Put on your fun hat and come in with a smile!"}
{"text":"Server was wonderful.
 I think there is an identity crisis as the entire decor is rustic western yet the Beatles,, Van Morrison and such are the background music.
 The  turkey melt was so so. Turkey tasted old.. Not a good grill. Bland taste despite the jack cheese. ( which I did not really see much of).  A lot of turkey but it was all bland.
 Fries were run of the mill under cooked frozen crinkle cut.
Salad was plain iceberg with ONE thinly sliced grape tomato and toooooo many fake fried onion rings. Just a disappointment.
 from the looks of the place I was hoping for cowboy fair: fresh, tasty juicy burgers. pulled pork, beans....hearty salads.
 Such a let down.Pricey for the so so food,
 ."}
{"text":"Ok, so looks like this was sold to PT's.

Stopped in for dinner after a movie last night.  There were 5 in our party.  

It has the same PTs menu as all the others so don't expect anything different here.  The food is typical Vegas bar food, but its all good.

Our waitress was great.  She let us know about the Happy Hour specials as soon as we sat down.  She worked something out for all of us as far as drink specials.  She also let us know when she put in our last items that qualified for HH so we didn't get any surprises on our bill.  We also got separate checks and she didn't give us any grief over that either.  In other words, we can be annoying, but she was very accommodating.

We sat inside and there was definately an air of cigarette smoke lofting around so if you're super sensitive to smoke this isn't the place for you.  We did notice outside tables on our way out so maybe they can serve out there if smoke is an issue for you.

All in all, can't complain.  Oh - except for FoxNews on the TV closest to us.  Would have preferred sports of any sort to that ... even golf.  Well, maybe not golf ..."}
{"text":"Food. Good good food. Carne Asada pizza, excellent."}
{"text":"Three words.  Macaroni and cheese.

Gooey, cheesy deliciousness. 

Yeah, the bar area is nice and colorful.  Big screens everywhere and  nice booth seating.   Waitstaff was quick, friendly..and accurate.  Price was nice.  yeah, yeah.

Their Macaroni and cheese is a penne pasta with diabetes-causing cheese glue sauce.  golden brown crispy crumbly goodness sprinkled on top.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Seeing as how yesterday's game between Denver and Pittsburgh may have been Peyton Manning's last game ever, I decided to join my friends at this Broncos bar. Needless to say, it was pretty busy, but not packed. I've been to places where the line at the bar was five deep, but it wasn't like that here. That being said, I was pretty disappointed with the service. My friends and I ordered food, but when it came, there were no napkins or silverware anywhere. It's true you don't need a spoon for spinach dip or a fork for buffalo wings, but no napkins? Seriously? Anyway, halftime rolls around and the manager Tim starts to give out prizes. One of my friends and I decide to check it out and when we get back to the table, my beer was gone. I ask my other friends what had happened to my drink and it turns out one of the servers had cleared it (even though there was still some in the glass)! What the fuck. I knew better than to ask for Tim, but I was pissed. Anyway, I could go on and on about this place but work calls. I may or may not add more later..."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I stumbled upon when I first moved here, and I've been back several times since.  They serve really great fried pickled, and their sliders are really really good. This restaurant is under renovation to soon be a sports bar, and that is just fine with me.  They have many televisions to accommodate the new environment."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and found both the food and service to be inconsistent.  Sometimes the food is very good (southwest style turkey sandwich, tortilla soup, mac and cheese, salads, etc...) and sometimes lacking in quality of incredients, preparation, etc...

Service is also been inconsistent from the hostess stand to the servers.  Sometimes friendly and attentive, sometimes aloof and detached.

Good bar selection, particularly beer (although my last time in they had reduced on-tap options.)

Good seating options as well - nice bar area, nice dining area, good outdoor dining with fire pit, and a private room area.  Did have a bad instance here, though, where child needed a high chair and none were offered - was not happy about this from a family restaurant.

I believe the inconsistency here warrants closer to a 2.5/5 rating, but will give the benefit of the doubt with a 3/5 overall rating."}
{"text":"As compared to my experience of the Roadrunner on Pebble - this one was far worse - food quality and preparation was very poor, service was slow and inattentive, on a fairly slow weekend day nonetheless.

Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Don't come here during graveyard the last two times we came here we got the worse service. Two bartenders and not one will come up to us. One was talking to girls for over a hour and other guy didnt come to West side of the bar. I'm a bartender and I would be ashamed if I gave a customer this kinda service. We will never step foot inside Road Runner on W. Flamingo Rd ever again. Thank you.."}
{"text":"Did you see the BEAUTIFUL BLONDE'S that are Bartenders. OMG. This place is Great. Really good Food. Tip well its worth it."}
{"text":"Been coming to this Roadrunner for year now; located inside the colonnade movie shopping center the Roadrunner delivers a nice slice of adult fun.  Pool tables and a full bar with plenty of seating area both inside and outside.

Outside the have a private bar for banquet events and fire pit for night time fun.  Have scheduled a few events during the summer and they are fantastic when it comes to meeting the needs of any party.  

One point to touch on is the exceptional grill they have.  Classic tri-tip and steak dishes like the Dr. Pepper marinated steak tacos add a nice flare to this country/urban grill/bar."}
{"text":"I do love my kitchy, themed, over the top bars, and boy does Roadrunner fit the bill. From the lamps wearing chaps to the chandeliers made of beer bottles, this place is just amazing. The indoor fire pits looked perfect for an evening of laid back drinking, although I assume they only use these during colder months. The bar tenders were gems, and despite my being itty bitty and trying to keep up with Vegas boy's drinking style, they kept serving me and laughing along with us. 
Didn't try the food, but it did look yummy. Vegas boy did some virtual poker/blackjack and won $220...not bad for sitting around drinking. 
I must have maid quite the impression, as the next night when we went bak for a pre night drink, they all smiled and remembered my name....yay for being  a \"local\" in just two nights.
Definitely not a \"destination\" spot, but for a low key night of drinking, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place so many times over the past year and it has never ceased to catch my eye. It's located by itself off to the side of the freeway and I have been meaning to stop by for a while now. 

I was finally able to come here with my boyfriend one day for lunch when we were in the area. We parked, walked inside, walked down the short hallway, and were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us down at a comfy booth in the middle of the restaurant. The place was pretty empty, but I preferred it that way because it made the ambiance perfect for a nice lunch date with my boyfriend. 

I couldn't help but marve at all the awesome decor. They really went all out on the western theme. There were cow skin chairs, stars, cowboy hats, cowboy boots, leather, dark colors, bold patterns, lanterns, and cactus. To be honest, I don't normally like western themes, but they made it very modern, mellow, and cool here. 

We opted for the smoked bee brisket (house-made barbecue sauce, smashed chipotle potatoes and grilled corn on the cob) with a side of spinach and the blackened salmon fillet (rice pilaf, grilled vegetables and sweet corn-black bean succotash). 

While we were waiting for our food, we were brought a basket of mini cornbread muffins and butter. They were soo good! They had a light, crispy outer layer and a soft, warm inside. It was perfect with the butter!

Our food came and it looked very appetizing. My salmon was presented very nicely atop a bed of rice pilaf with succotash poured on top. Both plates were delicious! I loved my boyfriend's brisket. It was so tender and juicy and the housemade sauce was the perfect compliment.  We ended up trading halfway through our meals so we could both enjoy each dish. 

I'd love to come back here again. Either for another lunch date, to try out the bowling lanes, or just for a drink. It's a very chill environment and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Love the wings and the fries. 
Good atmosphere, friendly staff and the food is usually quick!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Roadrunner since it opened. It used to be the hottest place in the Henderson area. Now it's still a nice place and offers good food but the service and quality level has slid down the scale  A LOT. I'm disappointed to say the least. We went for dinner / drinks the other night and had a cockroach run across my friend's foot. They didn't offer up a credit or even an apology from the manager, until we said something. Some of the bar stools are being held together with duct tape, the female bartender was good but the male bartender was mediocre to bad (had to get his attention several times). Just sad to see it in the spot it's at now."}
{"text":"Limited menu and very poor service in the restaurant area. More atmosphere than anything else. The outdoor patio looks great for hanging in the cool months."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this location in the near or distant future.  In fact, if all the bars in Las Vegas were wiped out except for this one, I'd drink at home.

First: This location is a proud establishment rooting for the Denver Broncos.  I'm a Houston Texans fan and I could even look past that flaw for the fact that I love(D) the atmosphere and food.

Second: Don't order a Vodka/Red Bull.  They keep the can open and going for all orders and if you happen to order when the remaining Red Bull is old and flat...oh well, that's what you're getting.

Third: Some of the WORST customer service I have ever encountered in my life.  Specifically from Jennifer (at the bar) and most recently from Collette (also at the bar).  I assume both women are just miserable people or that Jennifer is unable to comprehend simple tasks like splitting an order up between four people rather than complaining to her patrons about it.  

Today, my manager paid for our lunch and called to place an order.  Unfortunately, she called the wrong location.  When we had already been there for fifteen minutes, waiting, and she began to get frustrated, Collette loudly informed my manager, \"look, this is your fault, not ours.\"  My manager incredulously informed her that she never said it was her fault before she turned and left while I stayed behind and sarcastically thanked her for the superb custmer service.  She turned back around, gave me a condescending smile and replied, \"you're quite welcome, honey.  Anytime.\"

Nope, not anytime princess.  Like I said, I won't be back to this location ever.  I'm ready to ensure that friends, co-workers and family members also steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"came here for a late breakfast today with the parents. the service was really slow for not being crowded. it scared me a little bit to be honest. everyone was friendly though so that did make the slow service a little better. my dad ordered some coffee and it took quite a while to get to the table after our water. hopefully they were making him a fresh pot! i ordered the cowboy benedict and it was alright. nothing i would make a trip for, but something i might order again. the cowboy bacon on it was really salty though so it threw off the taste. luckly it was not smothered in sauce though. extra points there. i hate my egg benedicts smothered. the potatoes that came with is were really good though. i loved the seasoning. the best part of the entire meal though was sharing there homemade donuts. oh my watering mouth. they were donut holes covered in cinnamon sugar with a side of caramel dipping sauce. we ordered some for $4.95 to share and so glad we did. i would def come back just for those.
all in all it was okay. the service was nice when they did actually come around and the food was okay. the dessert was the best part though. yums!"}
{"text":"This was our third time at Roadrunner.Once again, the service was slow and inattentive and the food was sub-par, even for a bar. Coming from a place that touts itself as a quality dining establishment, I was so under whelmed we sent back our food and left. Keep in mind that this is a huge place, and there was only our table and one other, so the 'staffing issues' couldn't really come into play unless the waitress was also cooking the food in the back. Not a bad place for a drink if you're at the bar, but I would stay away if you want to hang out with friends and relax.."}
{"text":"The prices are great, and there's fun stuff to do like play darts or try the mini bowling. But the drinks are often quite strong, and quite inexpensive. As long as you have a designated driver, this is a positive combination. 

Since so much of this place caters to people that work in the food or service industry, their clientele appreciates great food and service more than most. And the barbeque itself is excellent, but there's much more available on the large menu. It seems like most of the food isn't made from scratch, and it isn't the usual fare of stuff dropped in a fryer. 

It's a great place to bring a group to watch a game while kicking back in their super-comfortable booths that face the TV's. Plus they often have karaoke outside, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality of the entertainment. Fortunately you can always just walk inside and listen to the music of professionals with better weather.

Great little locals spot, and very fun if you're looking for things to do late at night that are away from the tourist areas."}
{"text":"Love this place! They are great for breakfast and lunch, have never had dinner here but I am sure its delicious! The prices are reasonable and so is the service. It is also a Denver Bronco bar and shows the games during football season, they have reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back here again. Horrible service...... my table was being watched by the manager and it was awkward. I felt so freaked out I was scared to order anything because the manager and cooks were freaking me out. They could have messed with my food. Not vapor friendly either. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"In a city like Vegas you can go anywhere for food and drinks.  So when it comes down to it....it's the quality and the service.   The staff  here remember your name and always give you a smile.  Been here a few times and every bartender and server have been phenomenal.  I recommend Jenny cuz she has a smile and personality that's infectious.
Food is typical bar food 
Great drinks and prices
Bathrooms clean
Music more country than I prefer but you can play anything you like"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is perfect for this time of year. New food menu and signature drinks definitely bring some new life to the party. If you ever stop by, try the tinga tacos and beef enchiladas. Omg the beef enchiladas!!! Best I've ever had. If you're in the area and in the mood for some grub and/or drinks, I'd definitely give roadrunner a try. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed because this location has decided to switch to tavern style.  It's under construction now and they have removed the restaurant portion, the menu is nothing but an expanded bar menu.  We were very disappointed and the staff wouldn't comment on whether or not the full menu would return or if the restaurant would even return.  They lost two loyal customers tonight."}
{"text":"After the rude and inconsiderate customer service, I decided not only does this guy justin hate his job, but he also gave my a cup that had been cracked on the rim, and I almost slit my lip. The guy didnt believe me which made me even more mad. I'm seriously never coming back, and u shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I had been going to the Roadrunner for the last 16 years to watch the Denver Broncos football game. This week I showed up as usual a hour before the game in order to get a good seat. Just before kickoff the manager, Tim, told me that I would have to give up my seat to a gambler leaving me nowhere to sit in a packed house. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. I remember going to the Roadrunner Saloon up on Buffalo and Washington when I was maybe 10 or 12 years old and it was actually pretty darn good. Then again, there must be something to the fact that one or two of the locations went out of business over the years...maybe a change of owners...there has to be something to explain how awful the food is now.

To start off, Dad I walked into the restaurant and noticed the seat yourself sign, so we filed into the mostly empty dining room and plunked down. There's a lot to draw your eye in this place, tons of TVs playing whatever sports game is on at the time as well as interesting western-inspired decor. In any case, we realized we had spent a good 5-10 minutes looking around without seeing any sign of a waitress.

She finally did show up and took our orders pretty quick. We chose the baked mac and cheese as an appetizer and it was alright. It was a little small and rather tasteless, but it was food and we were THAT hungry.

For our entrees, I had the Dr. Pepper marinated steak tacos and Dad had the Carne Asade Burrito. We couldn't have anticipated how gross both of these dishes would be. I can't necessarily describe how the meat tasted in the tacos. It was sweet and also had a strong char flavor to it...like eating cigarettes with powdered sugar on top. The rice on my platter was also undercooked in some sports, as I noticed several hard chunks of rice while I was chowing down. As for the burrito, we could have done bette with Chipotle! 

Fortunately, like many of the other restaurants I've reviewed, I had a Groupon for $30.  The bill came out to $35 for the two dishes and the appetizer. I thought this was overpriced for what we had.

It's unfortunate that this place has taken such a dive. I used to love coming there as a kid for the chicken fajitas, which are unfortunately no longer on the menu :("}
{"text":"Upset at the bartender, I keep paying for plays on the jukebox but they keep playing only the music they want. Its upsetting that you spend money and they control the music.  Waste of money.  The bartender is too racist."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for this place, so we went in to check it out. Asked for a long island iced tea, got something that tasted like a glass of sweet and sour. They took it back though, so whatever. 
Tomato soup was pretty good, but the \"adult grilled cheese\" was a little too greasy and the cheese had little flavor. Fries were good though.
As far as the building itself, they have a non smoking dining room, and lots of LARGE tv's. If you sportsball, you'll probably enjoy your time here. They have drink specials during the games and lounge chairs where you can sit and watch. They also have a nice pool table."}
{"text":"The food has always been better than average.  
The drinks cold.
The service attentive.

Great place to have a drink & sit out on their patio.

Update:  The past 2 visits I have left less than impressed...
What happened?  It got worse.  We were completely ignored after moving from the bar to the lounge area for a good half an hour.  Then I went to go back another night & the waitress was a complete Bi*^h.  Once I flagged her down as she looked at me & kept walking.  I asked if they were still serving outside & she said at the bar they are.  Even though there were people with food menus right when we walked in on the patio.  It wasn't so much what she said, but how she said it.  I gave her a nasty oh no you didn't look, used the commode & then left."}
{"text":"Not very good food and horrible service! This bar is set up to be a country style bar but won't even play country music! The bartender told us they wouldn't play country music because some of their big gamblers hate country music. The only good thing about this place is their margaritas and the mini bowling."}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese I can remember!  The Whiskey Chili was really good, as was the Sweet Tea Cocktail. Good service made for a really great meal."}
{"text":"It is not so much that the food is bad, it is they don't care.  I guess if you are going to drink or for the entertainment, it might have others give it more stars.  The BBQ totally demonstrates their lack of caring.  The \"manager\" even asked, was told and essentially walked away.  The wife had filet, mashed and broccoli and blew her guts out all night.  Why?

Service was abysmal.  Hit and run.  And, the place was NOT busy when we were there.

I thought it was just our experience, but reading other reviews suggests such food and service is fairly typical of this place.  Would not have written a review had the manger -- or server -- given an ounce of interest.."}
{"text":"We have always been fans of Roadrunner. It was our go-to place for food and drinks. We took out of towners here and sent many friends here. Within the past few months we noticed that the service was getting a little slower, and the staff not as friendly. But, the food was good, so we over looked it. That being said, we went today with out three kids and had a horrible experience!! Because this place is primarily a bar, we always take our kids early. The kids menu is decent and they love the cowboy\"theme\". We went in for dinner around 4:30. Who eats dinner at 4:30 you ask? No one. That's why we do it with the kids, you get in and out of a place in no time!
When we first walked in we noticed that one of the booths was falling apart (the back cushion was hanging off and the lamp above the table was broken). We sat out selves and we were greeted by a very blah waiter. We ordered chocolate milk for the kids and he said they didn't have any. Weird that there was no chocolate syrup in the whole place. It took 50 minutes for our food to come out! There were two other parties in there, certainly not enough to warrant nearly an hour wait for food. The waiter brought out corn muffins, with no apologies or explaination. Just \"these are for while you wait for your food\".  When the food finally came it was pretty bad. My husband's burger was very tiny, dry and over cooked. The same with the children's burger. The children's chicken fingers were different this time also, very soggy, obviously something frozen and quickly heated up. The fries were gross. I could heat up better fries from the Walmart frozen goods aisle. I had the steak tips (my favorite from this place). They were cooked fine, but something was off with the seasoning. The mashed potatoes were ok but you could tell that they were sitting under a heat lamp for some time. Also, the ladies restroom was a mess. Broken locks on the stalls and all of the paper towel dispensers were broken. On the way to the restroom I passed by a man who appeared to be the manager and he didn't say a word. I expect a greeting when I make eye contact with an employee. It's good customer service. 
I don't know if they have come under new management or what, but Road Runner has gone way down hill in every aspect. It was sad a disappointing. We will never return!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst food we have had in quite some time. Ordered the filet and the were cold in the middle (not Med) and you had to saw your way through them. I actually sent it back and orderd a burger. That was just as bad as the whole bun was so soaked in greese it just fell apart when you went to pick it up. Even the Pinot Grigio was lackluster, no flavor what so ever. The good thing, the crinkle cut fries.
Needless to say we will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy hanging out in kitschy, over-the-top, western theme bars with a million and one pieces of flair? Then Roadrunner Saloon is the place for you. As blatant as the motif is, it's a cool space with a large bar area in the back, a dining area with plenty of comfy booths, and a really cool enclosed patio with a fire pit and plenty of seating. The biggest negative of the atmosphere is the foul, backed up sewage drain smell as you walk in.

They had limited happy hour specials when i went -- a couple beers were only a couple bucks and a few items on their bar food list were half off. After placing our order a food runner dropped off some tasty chips and salsa. We thought they were complimentary, but as it turned out they went to the wrong table. Our waitress let us know if was a mistake but let us eat them anyway.

For dinner the wife went with sliders -- two small beef sliders with cheddar cheese, chipotle mayo, and caramelized onions. They came with crinkle cut fries. Not bad, but they won't make you forget about the slider truck any time soon. Our son had a kid's quesadilla with fries which he enjoyed. The carne asada burrito I had was stuffed with grilled New York steak, cilantro pesto rice, pinto beans, cheese and a red chile sauce. It was topped with tomatoes, cilantro and sour cream and accompanied with a side of potato salad. The steak had a smokey flavor to it with a good bit of heat as well.

According to their website, chef Matthew Silverman, a Californian who worked his way up Wolfgang Puck's organization, helped open the Roadrunner franchise along with Agave and Vintner Grill. While Roadrunner is no where near as good as Vintner Grill, it's a respectable tavern with above average bar food. Giddyup."}
{"text":"If your reading this right now, you should be on your way to roadrunner, go see Tracy during the weekdays for lunch, she is the most amazing bartender of all time! You should tip her a ridiculous amount!  Try the turkey wrap, and the Dr. Pepper tacos. Trust a fat kid on this one!"}
{"text":"The food at the roadrunner is exceptional.  The service is decent.  My only issue is the lack of accommodation for smokers.  I know not everybody smokes and I am OK with that....I think, though, that the patio should be opened up (with mist-ers) for those who want a quick smoke.  I haven't been back to this place because it isn't smoker friendly...and I only smoke when I am drinking!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Their quesadillas, and their Mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had. BUT, I swear this is so far the 4th time that I've gone here just to sit down, wait 10+ minutes and then walk out because no one bothered to come over to my table. I'm not kidding! I'm actually typing this from my phone in their parking lot. There was one time-late night-that I was asked what I would like to drink, was brought that drink, drank that drink, then sat there with an empty glass for at least 15 or so minutes before I was asked if I wanted to order any food. I ordered my food (I'm sure you can guess what it was), got it and ate it. And yes, I also got my drink refilled too-I'm sure you're dying to know. Once again, my glass was damn near dry with no one checking to see if I wanted a refill-I really did want one, btw. In fact, no one came by at all! After I don't know how long- but long enough for my glass to be almost dry (I'm not exaggerating)- I finally just got up and paid my check with the bartender.

You're probably thinking \"Then why does this dumb ass keep going back there, then?\" Well the answer is simple-their quesadillas and Mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had.  

For the record though, there are 2 servers in particular that are really good. I forget their names, but they are women and they both have tats on their right arms. They are why I decided to add 1 more star to my review. The quesadillas and mac and cheese are another. Plus that 1 star that we have to give makes my rating 3 stars. If we were allowed to give 0 stars, then my rating would be 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were there around 3pm today. I found it better than I thought it would be.

The restaurant have happy hour from 4-6.30pm & 10.30pm-2.30am half off appetizers, $2 pint, $3.95 premium drinks.

We had Grilled Cheese sandwich, chicken wings, and Beef tips. They all taste great! Long Island and a mix drink (forgot the name) were tasty as well.

The service was good, the waitress checked on us several times.  I like good service because it makes the experience so much more enjoyable.  

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that we think the prices are a bit high for what you are getting. It is not crazy over priced, just a few dollars or so high on most of the food items and the drinks were $2-3 higher than other bar places. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than a 1 star I would. From the time we walked in until the time we left it was the worst dining experience I've ever had. 
Rather than good morning when we walked in it was sit anywhere. Unfortunately there wasn't a clean table to accommodate our party. 
Then the powdered Chia Tea was way overpriced. I had to send my food back because the eggs were spoiled tasting and the steak had more grizzle and fat than meat. 
Sarah our server was either embarassed to work there or just didn't know how do her job. I was even surprised that when I send my horrific meal back she didn't even offer a suggestion or apology.  The  manager didn't even come by the table to see if there was anything that could be done. 
I wouldn't recommend this place even to my ex in-laws."}
{"text":"I discovered this place because of a GroupOn and after reading some of the Yelp reviews was pleasantly surprised. Service was excellent and the food was creative, tasty and reasonably priced. The western ambiance was fun too. I also would give it a 2 $$ rating versus a 3 $$$. Most entrees are between $10-15."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, I seem to remember having *much* better food at their Centennial location (now closed). Jalapeno poppers were really tasty. Ordered the barbecue platter to share, chicken was overcooked sadly, but had good flavor. Brisket was grey in color and tough. Pulled pork was pretty good. Waitress was attentive, food was out pretty quick, but again, the food left much to be desired. Will not be back."}
{"text":"A slice of Southern awesomeness in a desert oasis! This is a big ol' barn style restaurant filled with a sea of comfortable looking chairs in beautiful, vivid colors. We started off at the bar for an early happy hour drink and the bartender was so kind and fun. After ordering a few appetizers we decided to move over to one of the many tables. 

What can I say about the baked Mac & Cheese but Yum! It was crispy on the outside and perfectly cheesy on the inside. We also had the fried pickles, which I just had to try. They were tasty served with a tangy sauce. All in all this is a great spot in Vegas with great food, and the staff was super sweet!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Las Vegas My sister (Nikki H.) took me here for dinner. 

OMG this place is freaking awesome!!! its like old western cowboy themed. They have great decorations large bar, huge sofas a small mini bowling alley and there booths are sooo comfy. 

Service is great at this restaurant and the servers are so friendly and nice! 

Food is amazing! 
I always always always order there Chicken Fried Steak... Its just so mouth watering and extremely delicious. It is buttermilk battered and the steak sauce is very rich and creamy I have to order more sauce on the side because is so good, the steak also comes with mashed potatoes and grilled chipotle corn also delicious. I also order the Baked Potato Soup very good i love it mmm the bacon and cheese is just an extra delicious touch. 

There food is good quality and delicious, and they give huge portions. 

If you like a filling quality meal this is a must try restaurant"}
{"text":"4 stars for decor: cool but not all of it is in very good condition
3 stars for service: friendly but no hostess for several minutes at 6 pm on a Saturday
1 star for food

Here's what we ordered:
Guacamole: watery, seemed like it was from a can... Definitely not fresh and not tasty.

Fried pickles: the only part of them with any flavor is what comes from the pickles themselves- batter is completely tasteless and way too much per pickle

Carne Asada Quesadilla: spicy and flavorless. Only flavor was from the jalapeños. Really gross looking and greasy.

Chicken Club Salad: the only part of the salad with any flavor was the tomatoes- thank God for that contribution. The chicken was so dry and flavorless, I only had a few bites and decided it wasn't worth the calories to eat something so bland.

Kids chicken fingers and French fries: this was BY FAR the best thing we ordered, despite the fries being soggy and seasoned with herbs but still amazingly bland and I'm quite sure the chicken fingers are your run of the mill frozen, boxed variety that the restaurant orders pre-made and they just warm up.

My husband also got a side salad for the shockingly high price of $6.95. I get it if you're eating at a fancy steak house, but where a lot of entrees are priced at 8.95, 6.95 for a side salad is ridiculous. Anyway, that was also completely uninspiring and really over priced. 

I came here one other time and got the nachos and they were fine. Good enough that I thought we should try the place a second time. My advice: if you really must eat here, get nachos."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with the chicken noodle soup! Turkey melt, carne asada quesadillas, and salads are great. My boyfriend and I both don't like their chips, or beans and rice, so the nachos aren't that great. Or anything with rice They are tri colored and taste like cardboard.  I love the huge tvs, large booths, and country vibe. Sometimes the service is poor. 
They have a great patio with a bar and booths, and at night they have fires."}
{"text":"Just left this place and paid $14.01 for a fish &chips meal. 3 small burnt pieces of fish and an old bucket of slaw. I really wish I could upload a picture. To say the least, not worth half of the price."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty comfortable place.  It's a bit hard to get seating in some areas since it's usually packed, but you can usually find seats though.  It has a bit of a nice outside area with the firepit.  It has that mini-bowling also.  The food's not bad.  Service is adequate.  There's usually a lot of people when I go, so I understand if there's a bit of a wait.  It's an ok place to chill and eat.  The crowd's young so I enjoy it."}
{"text":"Was a very bizzy evening with Broncos on Thursday night football, there were some opportunities but overall a great experience.  The kitchen team was amazing, they pumped out so much food at minimal wait time.  Wings were sort of dry, maybe freezer burned.  The only main downside was having to listen to the servers complain about side work, who is going to do what, I have been here since 2, and servers and cooks were eating on the line, I realize the service station is out in open, but I believe the silverware should be polished out of sight and no noise from tossing into bins.  Great teamwork, and plenty of TV's....management was very engaged giving high 5's to patrons, I would go back but maybe not order wings."}
{"text":"I went outside of box and decided to get the Dr Pepper tacos. They were nasty! The meat had the consistency of beef jerky. The rice did not go with the plate. The pinto beans were uncooked little pebbles and also tasted terrible. Out server didn't know any of the questions I asked her and took a long time to do anything. The bathrooms were pitch black! What kind of country bar plays Avril Lavigne, Kesha and Beyonce??"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar is back open!! I have missed the good food and friendly bartenders!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a really bad rap, and it's really not that bad.  See, when I go out, I like to interact with a lot of random people, and this bar just doesn't have that.  Every time I've been there, there have been at most 10 people hanging out having drinks.  I gave it another shot on a Saturday night at midnight, and there were still only 10-12 people there.  But I had some food that was pretty decent, and the bartender was pretty friendly and helpful with my drink selection.  If you don't mind an empty bar, or prefer it, you'll really like this bar.  There's plenty of comfortable couches and chairs, and all the food seems pretty decent.  Oh, and they serve the full menu until 1am, at least on the weekends.  Good late night find!"}
{"text":"i'm updating my review from 3 yrs ago about this place. This use to be my go to for any meal of the day... i loved their food and the service... they ended up having a fire and closed down... they were closed for almost 9 months and re opened in december however the kitchen is still closed. No clue how they can still call themselves Roadrunner Bar and Grill (via facebook page) and not serve food.  I am pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Returned to the Roadrunner after a long time away over the weekend.  If there is a symbolic bar of my late 20's, this one fits the bill...and it's still open which is rare.

Back in the day 4 stars easily, and the experience this past Friday night was great, I just think (like others) that they need to step up their game and update the place.  Get some decent LCDs and update the cowboy decor, nothing wrong with country but after a while even the cows go out to pasture.

Open patio is solid and the bartenders were friendly and entertaining.  And the beer selection still has a nice variety.  It was also nice to have the premium drafts comped after throwing some money at the machines without limiting it to certain taps.

It was pretty dead for a friday night but it worked out great for a nice time with a friend and grabbing a beer, much more relaxed feel than BJs where we hopped from earlier in the night."}
{"text":"The fish and chips and salmon is amazing, the service is good as well,Totally will come back"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to use a Groupon we purchased.  We used to come here periodically but haven't been back in years with the proliferation of new restaurants in the area. 

We were brought iced tea quickly and a basket with some corn muffins and butter.  Our server, Desiree, took our order promptly.  I got a cup of baked potato soup with bacon and chive topping.  It had a lot of cheese mixed in and it was excellent.  It didn't help with my cold much but it was worth the try!

For our mains, we each got the 6 ounce filet served with large potato wedges and a ramekin with creamed spinach and some browned cheese on top.  The seasonings on the potato wedges and the steaks were very tasty and the steaks were good like we ordered.  

We had the smaller steaks so there was room for dessert.  We should have shared.  They were very large.  My wife got the brownie with ice cream and I got the pecan and chocolate pie.  Both were very good.

A few things about the service.  Evidently there's only one person serving at the time we were there and we waited several minutes for someone to come to seat us.  Later, Desiree had to take care of all the tables and our wait for things was longer than need be.  

A very pleasant meal in nice surroundings."}
{"text":"DO NOT waste your time or money going here. The food is average priced but not very good at all. The wings were horrible as well as the fries and a few other dishes. I could get the past the fact that the food is bad (it is a bar after all) but the service is HORRIBLE! A lot of the people who work there are VERY RUDE!  Like it is an inconvenience for them to serve you!  The place is dirty inside as well and a few of the bar stools are broken so be careful when you sit down at the bar! And if you are a Broncos fan, you can still watch the games there but they are no longer considered a Broncos bar."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I have never tried a single food item off of the menu, so this is a review of the bar & saloon side of Roadrunner! I went last night (as I do almost every Wednesday) after kickball - it is the bar everyone goes to after games in my league. They offer a few drink specials for us, like a $5 margarita, a $5 shot, and some beer specials. The drinks are perfectly fine - I've always been satisfied - but they're nothing special. They all come in plastic cups (maybe this is only on Wednesday nights), which adds to the overall frat-party feel of the place.

It's the perfect setup for us on Wednesday nights, because they have a spacious inside where they setup a karaoke machine, and they also have a large outdoor area for playing flipcup and beirut/beer pong. It doesn't seem to have a lot of ambiance, but that could be because of the crowds of kickballers crammed in every time I am there!

Overall, it's a perfectly fine post-kickball bar, but I can't imagine ever wanting to go there on a non-kickball night. (Then again, I'm definitely not in the saloon-going demographic.)"}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times. I think the drinks are too expensive for a neighborhood bar. . . Food is decent nothing special but not bad. . . Service is always really friendly if not always prompt and on point."}
{"text":"I take my family there two or three times a month...it is a nice place to take the kids and get a pitcher of beer and not be in a national chain restaurant.  

The kids like the mac and cheese, I like the Dr. Pepper Steak Tacos."}
{"text":"I only come here to eat!  I usually get the fish and chips or Dr. Pepper steak.  The waitresses are always nice and friendly.  And the food is always good.  The place can get filled up on busy weekends so I'm not the only one that knows its secrets!  They have two tv's mounted up but you can always catch whatever sport is on by the bar.  It's not the best but it's not bad either.  If you're ever in the area, walk in and go to the left then look lost and they'll be happy to help you out!"}
{"text":"I love Roadrunner.  Whenever I am there I always have a good meal."}
{"text":"Sometimes this place rocks, sometimes it rolls.  I think there may be some turnover with the Chefs...maybe.  Not sure, purely speculative.  

My last visit was with friends visiting from SJ, CA after a 3.5 hour trek up and down Turtle Head Peak at Red Rock.  We were very casually dressed, tired, thirsty and hungry.  The UW Huskies were playing on one of the big screens (go DAWGS!!)...the Hostess tolerated my sense of humor, we got a booth with little wait, the Waitress was really helpful with suggestions and handled our group of 6 really well.  

The menu was filled with a lot of new items since my previous visit.  Gone was the cream corn though.  Very sad.  I'm sure my cardiologist is glad it's off the menu.  I had a really good burger with their SW Sauce.  Creamy, spicy and perfect as a Mayo substitute.  Rave reviews from everyone at the tables, the glasses stayed full and everyone was satisfied and happy.

The bar scene looked like a lot of fun.  Pool table, bowling lane, darts, etc...lots of booths, bar stools and loungy couches with coffee tables. Several big screens for sports.  Also, the outside has fire pits, so could be cozy during springtime and fall.

Good chow, clean men's restroom, plenty of parking, nice staff, and manager.  

Chow!"}
{"text":"One of my responsibilities at work was to help plan a small holiday party for some of the employees. I got quotes from a few places, Roadrunner Saloon is who my boss ultimately decided to go with. Since we had to put down a deposit for the party, we decided to eat there for lunch when we dropped off the check. 

Roadrunner Saloon is a western themed cowboy bar.... No big surprise there. I like how divided the space is... there is a nice patio when you walk in, an eating area with both booths and tables, and then a bar area with more seating options and even a couple bowling lanes! We didn't do any bowling on my first visit but perhaps during the party I will?

There was no hostess when we arrived, just a sign that said to seat yourself so we picked a booth in the eating area. Menus were brought out promptly, service slowed down a tad after that but I don't think anyone was working other then our waiter and the manager and it was never an excessive wait. 

When I was looking over the menu the baked potato soup jumped out at me, I wanted to try it but wanted something else as well. Our waiter let me substitute the fries that came with the turkey melt I was ordering for a cup of the soup for a small up-charge... I appreciate his willingness to work with me. 

Our group split the spinach dip to start, it was good but I have had better. The soup was a bit bland and my melt was a little greasier then I'd like but the avocado that came on it was great.

Overall it was a decent lunch experience. Nothing too exceptional, but nothing bothersome either"}
{"text":"This is not a classy joint but it is some good people watching.  I saw a homeless man, two tattooed punk kids making out and a table full of Running Rebels fans all in the same visit.  What this place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in entertainment value. After golf one day, we turned this place into a second living room.  Got comfy at a table.  And periodically ate and drank for several hours.  

Overall, the bar food here is mediocre at best but the beer is ice cold and the photo hunt machine has enough seating for your friends.  My kinda place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for drinks with friends and it was a good choice.  It's a nice, dark, western-themed bar close to my house.  Drinks weren't outrageous and service was good the handful of times I came here for drinks.

However,  I made the mistake of trying to have breakfast here one Sunday morning (I heard they had good breakfast!) and sat at a table for 10 minutes without ever being greeted.  Finally, my friend and I left and went to Denny's.  I'm willing to give breakfast at Roadrunner another chance, but be warned: Don't try breakfast here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The bar is very well decorated and the crowd is very personable and has a cheers feel. Corie is hands down my favorite bartender. There is not a single drink she can't make and she's a human roladex (knows everyone by name!). Very friendly, courteous, and outgoing. Would recommend this place to anyone. A++++ service!

Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this bar, or at least I was. Jenny, the bartender, has lost me as a loyal customer. She charged me for my drinks while betting tonight and when questioned said \"well, you're leaving with more than you came in with so you're fine.\"

Go to Steiner's or Sierra Gold up the road."}
{"text":"This place is SO CUTE! I was a little worried that I wouldn't like it after reading some of the other reviews on here but then again, I only had drinks and no food.  My friend and I decided to meet up for a few ''end-of-the-week' cocktails and it was the perfect atmosphere! The big lounge chairs were cozy and our server was sweet and attentive.  We both got the signature mojitos (without simple syrup) and it was made perfectly.  Our water glasses were always full and splitting up our checks wasn't an issue! They didn't even care when my friends big purse knocked over the empty glass and shattered glass went everywhere (We really are sorry about that!). The servers just laughed and said it happens more than we'd believe.  I will definitely want to come here more often!"}
{"text":"I love love love Roadrunner Saloon!  Here's why:

1. I love bar food, cowboy food, and Tex-Mex food.  Roadrunner Saloon carries all three of these types of food and they all taste great! I have tried a lot of the items and my belly is always happy afterwards.  Tasty food makes me happy.

2. Dr. Pepper Tacos!  Yes, you heard me right!  I love Dr. Pepper just a smidgeon less than my hubby and kid, like a paper thin difference.  So when I heard about these tacos, I had to investigate.  They are super duper fantastic!  The soda makes the meat so tender and flavorful.   They are fun to eat and taste great. I know this goes with #1, but anything regarding Dr. Pepper gets a special spot in my book.

3. Great service.  Every time I have been to this location, I have gotten great service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  I love good service because it makes your meal so much more enjoyable.  

4. It's family friendly.  Many of my favorite bar food joints have switched to a 21 and over only, which means I rarely can go.  Sad.  Roadrunner does allow kids and families, so we can all go out to a good meal.  My daughter loves the place too because she is all about cowboy stuff already.

5. The drinks are stiff!  If you are interested in bar service, the drinks are tasty.  I rarely have alcoholic drinks these days, but if you want one, Roadrunner serves stiff!

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that I think the prices are a bit high for what you get.  It isn't crazy over priced, just a $1 or so too high on most of the food items and $2-3 to high on the drinks.  Maybe I am just cheap in my old age, but that is how I see it.  I still love this place and will continue to go, I just wish it was a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"So/so
Went out to Roadrunner Saloon.

Here's the skinny:
Food was ok
Service was good
Time to wait for food...FAIL!

I ordered the steak salad - medium rare - and hubby ordered the french dip. Both take less then 5 minutes to make. We did this because we were planing on going to the movies. We had 1 hour to make our movie...lets just say it took longer then 35 min for the kitchen to make my salad and throw together my hubby's sandwich! The worst part was, they were not even to half capacity.

Our waiter was very kind and kept checking for us. He ended up confiding in us that the kitchen staff had started a mutant against the servers and were slowing everything down on purpose. We tried to tell the manager but it was like talking to a wall.

Overall, the food was fresh, tasty and well seasoned. My only complaint would be that we were 20 minutes late to our movie as a result, which sucked.

So, if you don't care about waiting 40 minutes for your food to arrive I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Everyday 3-6 PM --Rolling Rock $2, Heineken $4, Dos Equis $3,  1/2 price appetizers.

I always forget how cozy n country chic this place is.  Their patio is very inviting too - with couches and a fireplace, nice strings of lights too, creating the perfect atmosphere.  Lots of great big TVs, large booths and great oversized chairs near the bar for relaxing while you toast.  Just a great place to hang out - pool tables, darts, some sort of a mini-bowling alley (yes, seriously!). 

The food - it's truly hit and miss.  Our server told us they continually change the menu and are working hard to keep the items people love and replace the ones that they don't.  This trip hubby had the 1/2 rack of ribs and the meat was falling off the bones!  He was in heaven, said they were sooo delicious! I wasn't  fan of the sauce, but he was in another place as he ate his ribs and lumpy mashed potatoes.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and that too was delicious!  Recommended by our server who said it was one of their most popular items - so I figured it must be worthy and  ..  .. I love Mexican food too!

So the last star . . . it's not a five star experience for me.  I've had taco, we've had sandwiches that were truly just ok.  I've had a salad here before too and it was just that .  . . . just a salad. Didn't wow at all.  

Absolutely worth the visit - if for nothing else a happy hour beer and a game of bowling!!"}
{"text":"My family and I use to come to this place once every two months. The last visit was a shocker. My mom and wife and I sat down to a empty bar and restaurant, we ignored it and ordered our food and drinks. It took the waitress 20 minutes to get our drinks we ordered waters, tea, and wine and a beer. 

Our food was simple, but we waited patiently and about 45 minutes later came our food and it wasn't even what we ordered, so we sent it back. When we retrieved our food we originally ordered and finished our drinks the waitress sat in the back talking with her manager joking around and never bothered asking if we needed a refill.

Lazy company in my opinion now, maybe under new management, but my friends, family, and myself will not return to this dump."}
{"text":"Always had a good time here!

Great happy hour, and never really too crowded.  Not necessarily a place to meet people, but a place you should definitely choose if you just want to grab a bite and have a few drinks with some friends!  I've tried almost everything on the menu, and never regretted a choice!

Plenty of things to entertain a party, with the mini-bowling in the back, pool table, and the always awesome Golden Tee!

Sometime service can run a little slow on weekday afternoons, but unless you're in a hurry or dying of starvation, its nothing really worth complaining about."}
{"text":"the atmosphere was very cool, western with lots of big screen tv's & 2 bars. the place was kinda dead for halloween night. the server was very nice and fast. the fries were great-crispy & flavorful. the hamburger was juicy and very tasty. the turkey melt was very spicy with loads of turkey. the beef dip was huge with lots of very good roast beef but not alot of au jus for dipping. overall it was very good i would recommend it. next time we will have to dine in when we are not in such a hurry"}
{"text":"Paid a lot of money for bad food, won't go back


Ordered dr pepper steak tacos, meat cloyingly sweet, chewy and tough, only had one bite. Beans undercooked, rice only redeeming quality in meal. Husband ordered hamburger mac and cheese, hamburger helper tastes better.  Waitress completely uninterested in why she was removing full plates of food from our table.  42 dollars and wont be back"}
{"text":"This is the place to be for Denver Bronco fans!  It is definitely the next best thing to sitting in a stadium. The waitstaff is one of the best, the enthusiasm is second to none, BUT... The value opposed to the quality and quantity of food along with minuscule selection is one of the worst!  The owner definitely takes advantage of the die hard fans by serving tiny portions for big $$"}
{"text":"This place has a cowboy/western theme. We sat at a booth with a rough cowhide leather. It was kind of gross, because it was almost like touching the real thing,. We ordered chicken fingers, mac and cheese, and nachos. The nachos were a bit stale and weren't very good. The french dip looked good, the calzone was humongous, with spinach and cheese inside. And the country fried steak was just ok. it came with a side of roasted whole corn. The place has a pool table, poker table, and one of those bowling simulators."}
{"text":"We had a $30 Groupon.  They were located on W Flamingo Rd/215 in Las Vegas.  I loved the southwestern décor.

We ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla, Shrimp Tacos, and the Texas Dip.  Everything was average.  Nothing outstanding.

I would come back for the 1/2 priced appetizers during Happy Hour from 3-6pm."}
{"text":"It looked like a cool place to grab a bite, but the looks of the grunge exterior didn't compensate for the lack in quality in the meal.

For a meal that is on average $8-$11  per plate, you would expect it to be 
fresh, but instead it tastes like it was frozen packaged and then baked. 

For example the french fries were the kind you buy in a big buy and can oven at home... at least that's how it looked and tasted 

Second, the Pulled Pork's BBQ tasted off... 
the bun was cold and the coleslaw on the bun didn't make it taste any better 
The bun should have been slightly toasted with butter or mayo, but instead it was cold and plain 
You can go to Vons and buy a pack of pulled pork for that feeds 4 people  that tastes better then theirs...

Unfortunately I was looking forward to eating here, but was greatly disappointed by their quality of food for the price they were asking per plate. 

If you catch the lunch special (ends at 3) then I suppose it would have been comparable to the quality, but other then that, I would never eat here again. 

The entertainment of TVs was nice, but I rather go somewhere that has better food for that price."}
{"text":"A cowboy style bar/restaurant in every sense of the word. Not that its a bad thing but a lot of western decor and people on horses like a dark rodeo but blasting the rock music videos. (thanks for not playing country music) Drinks seemed expensive ($6 Newcastle/Guinness) since I don't drink a lot but the food and service were nice enough to not draw any complaints. Had a Philly cheese steak which I hope you can't mess up and it was tasty. They also have a neat outdoor patio section which is nice at night and when the weather is cooler."}
{"text":"So they are a Denver Broncos bar and I'm a loyal Denver Broncos fan (40 years now).  Their loyal game time fans are being charged $20 to get in the door for seat.  Now if we got a $20 credit for food or drinks, that would be different.  There's too many places in town to watch the game and with better giveaways!  We were there last week and had a great time, food was good and people were great.  But $20 to get in???  It's not even the money, it's the principle of it."}
{"text":"I had fun here! People are crazy! The customer service was awesome ...Jessica was super nice and comprehended everything fine  and was very attentive (my drink never stayed empty) and the GM was great as well. I didn't try the food but i have at other locations and it was great ...for real go hang out!"}
{"text":"Went here last night.. First time and had zero expectations. I really liked ur atmosphere (we sat in the bar area) . Lots of giant tvs to watch sports and stadium style seating as well.. They also have a lot of fun stuff to do like touch screen games, buck hunter, and a pool table. They have a really neat seating area outside.. But was too cold to hang there on this visit. Ordered drinks .. Large beers on tap.. We had nachos as an appetizer which was excellent. I had the dr. Pepper marinated stead tacos and they were really phenomenal. I will definitly be coming back and can't wait to catch a game here."}
{"text":"I like their atmosphere.  The food is not bad.  It's a good place chill and eat."}

{"text":"Bartender was rude, I ordered food to go and the cook came out to drop it off asking the guy next to me if it was his, he said no and the cook said \"I don't f***ing know\" and slams it down. I paid for my food giving the bartender well over the amount of the check and he assumed all the change was for him, I had to ask for my change. Food was good, service sucked."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch. We live nearby but had never tried it before. First off I thought the place had a nice ambiance and was decorated well. The menu seemed a little limited and pricey but I chalked the lack of variety up to the fact that it was lunchtime. We ordered the jalapeno appetizer and waited for at least 15 minutes for someone to take the rest of our order. In the meantime I did hear the only other tabletop at that time complain that they had been brought the wrong burger. We overlooked what should have been a warning and placed our order anyways. My husband ordered the Texas Dip which was ok but pretty much on par with a dip sandwich at Arby's. I ordered the wedge salad and Dr Pepper steak tacos. The wrong salad was brought out and by the time it was corrected of course our entrees were done as well. I sent the salad back not just because the entree was done but because it was one of the saddest excuses for a wedge salad I had ever seen. The steak tacos were overdone and just strange. The only reason I am giving this place two stars instead of one is because the manager did come out and speak with us and take care of the situation. However I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad locals spot to stop in for video poker and bar food. If you're into video poker, they have a very large bar area with many machines. The menu is pretty standard, with bar food such as burgers, soup and fried items. I did try the grilled cheese with the tomato bisque soup. It was good, on average par with bar food."}
{"text":"I am a Roadrunner fan!  The atmosphere of the bar is a nice mix of classy and comforting with the 8 or so recliners.  This is a great place to belly up to the bar or relax with some friends.  There is an outdoor fire pit for a more cozy, by the camp fire feeling.

Roadrunner has a generous selection of libations and, my favorite, PBR on TAP!!  Drink prices are right about average and a $20 bill can get your head spinning pretty well. The bar staff is great and has very little turn over.

My only knock on Roadrunner is the food... thus far.  Recently I had the Dr. Pepper Taco's.  Now... this sounds amazing, but from a culinary standpoint, a beast to pull off.  I am not quite sure what I was expecting, but I certainly did not get it.  When the plate came out the presentation was much more a fajita style dish than a taco.  In fact, I tried numerous times to make a taco out of my ingredients and failed.  The meat had a very sweet (I know, Dr. Pepper, but even this was a bit strong) glaze to it and was slightly tough.  There was little to no cheese provided, and I am a firm believer in \"when all else fails, drown it in cheese\".  The rest of my plate was drown in beans and rice.  Not that this is an issue, but it was not expected on a taco plate.  The price was a bit steep as well, right around $14.  If rating off the food alone, I would be compelled to give them 2 stars, but the atmosphere definitely helps their case.

Not to accuse all of their food of failing to meet expectations, I have also had a hamburger from Roadrunner.  While it certainly surpassed the Dr. Pepper Taco's, it is not a reason to come back.  

The only other tip would be to avoid this place around 10pm on Wednesday nights.  The kickball league comes in, and while they are all really cool, it turns into a 3-ring circus with very long wait times."}
{"text":"The decor caught my eye right when I got in so cute, old west theme. Everyone was friendly and we were greeted as we walked in with a \"Hi, be right with you\" from the bartender who I later found out was Collete. She was funny and friendly but some people look to make people mad,,We decided to sit in a booth on the lower level so I could watch sports and let me add in their GIGANTIC screens behind the bar are enough to have me there every Saturday and Sunday for football. I must give mention to the food as I am a Chef and that is the reason I ventured in there. Comfort food, large portions and GOOD!! I did not get anything off the happy hour or football special menus but looked at them and since I know I will be back we will see I love this place!"}
{"text":"I always forget how cute & country-ish it looks inside of RR ..They have a mini bowling alley, pool table, darts & a couple other fun games.. We have even seen people play beer pong there. They have a little stage for performances and karaoke. I love their semi covered patio area.. It has lots of comfy seats, a fire pit, its own bar and lots of pretty twinkling lights.. Like other bars they also have a separate dining room away from all the action but we prefer to sit in one of the many booths by the main bar.. Our server was friendly and the food was good.

We tried the:
-Vaquero Steak Salad_ I thought this was just OK.. I don't like ice berg lettuce so next time I would probably ask for Romaine.. The steak slices were not that impressive and the olives were too overpowering.. If you're watching what you eat ask for the salad without the fried onions so you won't pick them out..
-Blackened Salmon Filet _ This was delicious! A nice sized filet that tasted fresh on deliciously grilled veggies.. YUMMM
-Sliders & Wings _ On a previous visit we tried their sliders & wings.. both were tasty and came with some nice crinkle cut fries.. 

My BF put $10 in the machine and left with $50.. One of our other friends came up 1K so the machines here are definitely somewhat loose~ 

HOT TIP: Happy Hour everyday from 3-6!!! Half priced apps, $2 Jose Cuervo shots & Runnerritas, $3 Dos Equis, $4 Heineken & Rolling Rock ;]]]"}
{"text":"The few times I have came to this place I have been taken care of very well. The staff takes your order, refilled my drinks, checked back a few times with us, brought our bill at an appropriate time. Our food is always hot, and we never had to look for a waitress because we always had what we needed when we needed it."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends service was
Good but Slow even with an almost empty restaurant had the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked but seriously over seasoned...tip to chef less is more! Best part of the meal the baked potato soup stupendous that and the Cardinals winning the World Series!!"}
{"text":"The Atmosphere of this place looked very clubby upon arrival , It's cowboy styling  mimicked that of a cheap Crazy horse. They had a big patio area which would make a really cool late late hangout since this place is open 24 Hours.  Later we found out they have Industry nights and club stuff which would make sense how they are staying in business. The dining room was blocked off but we were able to sit there anyway thanks to a nice server. The bar area seemed hip but it was filled with wankers so we were glad to be in the dining room. 

The Food was ok, I thought it would have been better seeing all the cars every time we drove by. We started with a salad which was good although it lacked  in toppings. I ordered the \"DIP\" style sandwich and it was pretty good. My friend got the barbecue chicken which really didn't live up to its expectation being a little dry, and a carrot swap for sweet potatoes was a funny excuse for improper preparation. The Food was just alright and for what it was a tiny bit over priced. Our server was a very nice young girl who was trying very hard, hope we made her night with our more than generous gratuity.

If you want to eat somewhere with really good food, there are a lot better places cheaper in the Vegas area, but If your looking for a cool place to bring a big group of people for drinking playing video poker and just hanging out than this a great spot for you 

Road runner - a good spot to chill out in Henderson"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood. Love our new bar. We came in with some friends and loved the low key vibe. The quesadillas are killer and the TV's are gigantic. I was in football heaven."}
{"text":"Review of the $5.95 lunch special

I always see this place exiting Flamingo off 215 and the banner advertising $5.95 lunch everyday also caught my eye.  So my friend and I decided to check this place out because hey, who doesn't love a lunch special?

The lunch specials include: pulled pork sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, BBQ chicken pizza, burger and chicken salad.

Our waiter seated us and gave us menus - we had to ask him for the special lunch menu.  He takes a few minutes to bring that over and my friend and I decided to share the pizza and pulled pork sandwich.  Our waiter was super slow throughout our whole dining experience here.  Slow enough to the point that you and your friend look at each other like, \"Hey, it's been a while since we ordered. Wow, this is slow!\"  

So we get our food after ~20 minutes and was it really worth the wait? The BBQ chicken pizza was ~6  inches...4 small slices of tasty, but small pizza.  The pulled pork sandwich at least came with a side of wavy fries.  Both meals were okay, nothing to rave about, nothing special. 

Honestly, don't order the pizza for your lunch, you will be so sad, it's like a kid's meal...if even that.  If you are going for the lunch...I guess the pulled pork sandwich would be okay.  Their sandwiches probably at least come with fries. 

I honesly don't think I would come here again on my own will.  Roadrunner, you will be remembered for your slow service!"}
{"text":"New rule: any establishment that has a nice patio automatically gets 3 stars because you can't really mess up beer, and if you can sit outside and enjoy a frosty bev that is noteworthy in Vegas. Apparently, bars want us inside giant, dark boxes feeding video poker machines, so kudos to those that actually let us escape into the sunshine and fresh air. 

Road Runner does just that, and they do it well. Their patio is quality with open fires, lots of space, and a swing. Yes, a swing. The only bad thing is that there isn't really a view, but given the location, this may be a bonus because the only real view to be had would be of cars zooming down the road.

One other odd attraction is a couple of mini-bowling lanes behind the bar. It isn't cheap, but it is a novelty perhaps worth trying.

As for the food, we stuck with the nachos, and they were ok. The ingredients seemed fresh, but I prefer nachos with cheese sauce or at least a solid effort at equal cheese distribution. These had shredded, melted cheese, which never quite delivers the perfect cheesy nacho bite. 

My verdict: Solid place to go for a cold beer on a patio 24-hours a day. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The perfectly golden shrimp nestled in the shrimp tacos were beautiful. Seriously, they were visually stunning, and they were good. The potato soup and chili were too, and it provided a nice perch for watching some football. I couldn't decide if the tastiness was the magic of sodium, but regardless, I chowed down.

The menu is bar food, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, some BBQ and grilled items and salads. Standard fare, and it took us a while to decide what sounded good. 

Even though the majority of the spot is reserved for smokers, there is a smoke-free side room. The spot is clean and has a nice decor just like the other Roadrunners in town. Service was nice, but a bit spotty at times.

For the price, I think the service should be more consistent. For example, my husband originally ordered the half chicken, and the waiter came back and said that the chicken was frozen and would take a little longer to prepare. We asked how long, and he went to ask the chef, returned and said one hour!  On a Saturday night, it strikes me as a point of concern that one of their main entree items is not ready to go. We ended up skipping the chicken.

Given the value, selection and service level, I could only see us returning to nurse a bowl of soup or chili, sip a beverage and watch some football. It wouldn't be a dinner destination for us, but it is an ok bar spot for snacking and watching a game."}
{"text":"Typical bar food type place that is good for large gatherings. They are accommodating, have a fairly large place, and it has never been too busy when we went for an after work get together.

Roadrunner Saloon is nothing special, but it's not bad either."}
{"text":"I wondered in to check this place out, but its outside appearance made me curious as to what was inside.  Inside is kind of an over the top country/cowboy theme.    In my opinion, more space could be devoted to restaurant seating and less to bar seat, but again just my opinion.  Far more important, the food is fabulous.  The Vaquero salad, may be the best salad I've every had.  Great combination of salad and steak.  The Dr. Pepper marinated steak tacos, didn't work out so well, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the rest of the menu.  Good drinks too."}
{"text":"Decent food. Cute atmosphere. Good service."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Broncos game. It is definitely an active Broncos fan bar. The game specials were pretty good. It was really busy, had to sit in the back area. The staff were friendly and the food was good for bar food."}
{"text":"I wish I knew it was a Denver Broncos bar before we walked in... we were betting on the Dolphins this week (and they won!), but it made the game kind of annoying to listen to the Broncos peeps cheering the whole time..

That being said, service was just eh, and I found the atmosphere pretty cheesy. The mini bowling looked pretty fun. The best part about this place? The sirloin sandwich.. WOW. Best rendition of a \"french dip\"/\"steak sandwich\" EVER. Yummy bread, yummy meat (not chewy like most are) and awesome cheese-meat ratio... I will go back just for that sandwich.. just not on a sunday when I'm betting against Denver !"}
{"text":"The pecan pie is to die for and the waitress is amazing. Those two things are the reason we come here!!  If you visit this road runner ask for Kendra. Best waitress in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well I'll be damn. Needed a place by the soccer fields during a tournament and needed it quick. Hungry people in car. Including me. This place scored. We ate at lunch time but ordered off the breakfast menu. Excellent, excellent food. Great vibe for families too. Overall, happy this place was near, easily accessible and above all else, very tasty food and good for the value. We'll hit it up again in the next day or so."}
{"text":"Wanna talk about legit Baked Potato Soup with chunks of potatoes & bacon & great cheap bar food? Road Runner is the place to be! We weren't too sure about this place esp with the reviews, but we wanted a new place to try for happy hour. After 10:30pm the sliders, chicken tenders, and wings all served with crinkled cut fries are 50% off... so it comes down to about $4.50? What a great deal! We added onto our tab the Kettle Baked Potato Soup and a dinner salad with honey mustard dressing. Mmm there arent many restaurants that give you 100% green leaves. I'm so picky with my salads and because of so many bad experiences, I'm always inspecting my salad for any bad lettuce! But anyways, the salad was so fresh and green, it was topped with sun dried tomatoes, onion straws and a few other yummy stuff. The chicken tender was made from real moist chicken breast, not the spongy stuff you get from fast food places. The sliders were also moist and flavorful. I would've given this place 5 stars but their chicken wings just didnt make the cut! Try this place out, I think you'd be just as surprised as me with the quality of food! ~cheers"}
{"text":"Broncos fans...you have found your home away from home!!!! 

The seating is amazing. Comfy upholstered chairs in rows! Get there early! 

The menu is great and the kitchen is flexible and very accommodating. My server, Kristen, was so sweet, attentive, and made the experience seamless! 

They have an area separated for families who might want to away from the bar and gambling area but still with screens! It has a blue sky ceiling like the Forum Shops. That's cool.

They do raffles throughout the games for some really cool stuff! 

Annnnd it's open 24 hours!!!!! 

#gobroncos!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a drink here; really I've only come here to play pool with my boyfriend, and it's been a pretty quiet place in my experience.  I like that a lot, honestly.  Sometimes I just want to chill and play pool, instead of being mobbed by loud noises and crowds, and this is a place that's great for that."}
{"text":"When the husb ventured in after seeing the Broncos flags outside, he called me happily to tell me he had found a Broncos bar! I'm not the biggest football fan, so when he told me this I rolled my eyes and said that's nice. When I went to visit a week later, he took me here for lunch and to watch the tail end of the game.

The menu is typical bar food with a bbq flair. I was pleasantly surprised though, the place was clean. I ordered the cobb salad, it came out split which was an accident, but it was actually fine, because it was big enough that I had the extra split scooped right into a to-go container.

On game days they turn all the lounge chairs toward the projector screens and make it a comfy seating situation. The patio looked like it would be a nice place to hang if it was warmer out too."}
{"text":"Pretty typical neighborhood bar for Las Vegas. The food is okay. The drink prices are okay. Service was a little slow at times plus we ordered Nachos, when they were delivered they ran away without giving us napkins, plates or forks. The Nachos with pulled pork were decent but nothing special. The decor is full on cowboy/southwest themed, it works somehow. A few pool tables and other games available to play for your amusement. The place can get busy on a weekend night, but there's lots of room, and a cool patio to get away from the crowd."}
{"text":"It gets a bit loud, but its also a bar so what do you expect. I love their Dr.Pepper steak tacos! They are amazing and everyone should  try them! Also their french fries are yummy. I will definietly go back and have dinner again. My boyfriend enjoyed the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I'm actually really surprised with this place. You can seat yourself in the bar area, and out of all the times that I've been there, it's taken awhile for the staff to acknowledge you, but the atmosphere makes up for it. Its a really relaxed place whose decor just keeps your eyes wandering. They have cowhide upholstery on some of their seating in the bar area. Haha. It's pretty funny, and definitely ironic. They have billiards, video poker, some video games and even virtual bowling in their bar area. The outside patio seems relaxing as well with seating around some bonfires and wooden swings. Seems like a really great place to spend some summer nights with a cold drink. For appetizers, their macaroni and cheese is REALLY cheesy. Definitely something that needs to be shared. I've tried their steak, which is delicious. You can also add a lobster tail for $10. The lobster tail was a little over cooked, but overall I was pretty satisfied with the main course. For desert, you definitely need to try their mini donuts which are covered in cinnamon and sugar with a caramel dip. I hear that their making new changes to their menu. Which definitely is a reason for us to return to this place."}
{"text":"This place is now PT'S Pub....I've never really had a problem w/other PT'S, actually like them!  This one however was horrible!  The waitress we had was bad from the start.  Took us quite a while to get our food & drinks and there were LOTS of open tables, so it wasn't busy!   One gal ordered a glass of wine and she said it was like the bottle had been open for a week or so.  When we ordered dessert, when it was brought to us we had to ask for spoons and that took about 10 mins to get.  we ended up sending it back because it was raw.  At this point we told her to forget it and we didn't want another one. When we finally got our bill we were charged for the dessert!  I asked her to take it off, she came back with it and said the manager said it was cooked through and we had to pay for it!?  Umm..NO, it wasn't I wasn't going to pay for something I didn't consume.  I was shocked that IF they were going to go that route the manager didn't come over and talk to us BEFORE they were going to try and charge me for it.!  I will NEVER go back to this location.  Not worth my time or $."}
{"text":"This roadrunner, like most others has gone waaay downhill in the past year. This used to be one of my favorite bars, and I hadn't gone in a while.  
We got a happy hour ad in the mail, so we decided to go.  The advertised happy hour $2 drafts applied only to PBR (NOT stated in the ad).  We ended up getting a pitcher for $8. Not a great deal for Pabst.  To add insult to injury, the beer was also completely flat.  
The advertised happy hour \"premium drinks\" for $4...were just domestic beers!  $4 for a pint of bud light, during happy hour, really!? 
We decided to get some food, because their happy hour apps were listed as half off.  Of course this only included half of the appetizers on the menu, even though no restrictions were stated in the ad.  We got sliders, and chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders used to be amazing here, but these were obviously the kind you buy frozen in bulk, and reheat.  Ew.  The fries that came with them were crinkle cut, pale, soggy, and inexcusable.  The sliders were mediocre.  We paid $4.50 (happy hour half off price) for just 3 of them, and they didn't even come with fries.  I can only imagine how ripped off I would have felt if I paid the full price of $9 for each for these crappy appetizers.  It took the server a full hour to remove our empty glasses, and dirty plates from our table.
I've dealt with slow service here before when it was busy, and I was sitting outside.  When I'm sitting inside, 3 feet from the bar, I generally expect a little more.
Roadrunner used to have awesome service, and great bar food.  I never had any issues paying full price here before.  Unfortunately, since they decided to cut back on service, and quality, I won't be coming back.  Not even at half off."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it is not.  Had a bacon burger (can't remember the name) and was delicious, but have had other items and its mediocre.  I think it depends on the cook.

This place is hardly crowded and the drinks are always awesome.  Where else can you do mini-bowling?  Love it!!"}
{"text":"I personally have had no bad experiences here. Their Mac and cheese is the reason I go there and will continue to be for pretty much ever. It's an appetizer, but there is enough there to fill you up and at $6 after tax, you can't go wrong. I could sit here and go into detail on how cheesy and delicious it is, but it's one of those things you have to experience yourself. 

They have super cheap breakfasts. $1.99 I think? that give you a good portion as well. Not only that but $5 lunch specials such as hamburgers and burgers. Their burgers are pretty good but I haven't had a sandwich yet. All and all, I've had at least 7 items on the menu and nothing has been bad. Their happy hour is good too."}
{"text":"went there afterhours after dinner and decided to seat outside by the fireplace for wine and appetizer. It was really cold but the fireplace seemed cozy, and made it all worthwhile. The freezing waitress was friendly and nice enough to check upon us once in awhile in her tanktop, and the wine was decent, with decent appetizer. It was fun and probably will go back again in future with some friends for appetizers and more wine! :)"}
{"text":"The graveyard bartenders are awesome. Becca never let our drinks get warm and they were always full. The Roadrunner will be our go to place for late night."}
{"text":"Well not the first time I have been here, so I though I should finally write a review.  I guess you can say this is your typical Las Vegas Bar and Tavern.  It has a cowboy theme - nothing to orginal here.  It is a broncos bar if there are any Bronco fans left...

I don't like the oversized lounge chairs - thay are totally uncormfartable and clunky.  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  They do have a seperate dining area.

The food here is ok.  We got there during a thursday night football game so they had some game specials.  3 apps for $8.95.  Sounded good but the apps were like mini size.  Jal poppers, guacamole, mini-shrimps.  The shrimps were small - you could probably call them krill... I understand it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.

To save this visit;

They had Pitchers of Kokanne Beer for $8!!!!  Love it!!  I will go to a place that serves Kokanne specifically for the Kokanee.

This is not my favorite place to grab a beer but it is okay in a pinch."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night, and for a Friday night at 10 was dead! In my head, I thought this would be more like Stoney's with room to dance, fun upbeat music, and a cool environment. The atmosphere is neat, very country chic, and I liked the pool tables and bowling in the back. However, I wasn't too impressed with the bartender (blonde girl with black framed glasses). She seemed annoyed any time my friends went up to order a drink. We planned on staying for a couple hours to chill and enjoy our girls night, but the music was so depressing after 30 min we had to go. When they played upbeat tunes, we were having a blast by the pool tables singing and dancing, but for 20 min straight it was slow depressing want to go cry in your car during a rainstorm music. We all started yawning and the night started to drag on. At that point we knew it was time to go. Too bad the music sucked because we would have stayed much longer, invited more friends, and probably would have ordered a couple rounds of shots. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is very unique. Very cozy bar, has 2 pool tables, a few game machines like ping pong, mini bowling alley (which I thought was pretty awesome), and the outside patio had 3 fire pits with swigs, it was very nice. We didn't eat but ordered a few drinks and they were a bit pricey and as much as I loved the atmosphere not sure if this will be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"When my favorite neighborhood bar and grill places. Great food and atmosphere. Reasonable prices.Discount specials available on Groupon or LivingSocial"}
{"text":"Ive been going to this establishment, oops, let me rephrase...DUMP...for awhile now.  Always had pretty good service, and I do like the chicken fingers very much.
Let me explain why i am rating this a 1star
After work I met a friend there for some late night fingers and fries, as soon as we sat down, some crazy drunk dude was falling all over himself and had to be escorted out, and found out that in the parking lot he took a WHIZ right in front of the entrance, GROSS...next after the waitress \"Kristen\" brought my fingers, she immediately said I had to pay the bill cause her \"Manager\" said so! What!!!! YEA! Ok if they wanted to close out for the night, she could have said it a different way, and I told her I was going to order more food later...turns out she never came back for a tip or to collect the money from my second order that I got which was the disgusting jalapeno rings(YUCK!).
AND the bartender was rude when I asked for a pack of matches and wanted the 4.29 for the damn jalapeno things, I asked for the check, which he did not offer and my friend just handed him 7.00
REALLY?????????
UMMMMMM NO, that is all wrong
They lost a loyal patron
I will never go out of my way to drive there again, thanks"}
{"text":"We were there to see the Broncos v. Patriots. The two stars are given for the food, which was delicious! The fried pickles are amazing. Sadly, the service is slow (so slow we had to leave our table to go to the bar to get another drink). The bar charged us a different price for our drinks then the server did! We asked our server to get us a manager. Although we were there for a hour after we asked to see a manager..they never came to the table, nor did the server to offer us another drink. The game even went into over time and we sat there with empty cocktails."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had excellent service and found every single time. This morning around 11 I came in for some food to go, and a quick beer while I wait (cause, hey, why not? It's a Thursday) and the bartender was super sweet and explained that I could have my choice between the breakfast and lunch menu.  Can't beat that! After looking at both menus I went with the cowboy eggs Benedict which was delicious. I can never say no to eggs Benedict anyway. The food here is always great though. Also, as a plus, this place has hot single guys by themselves. Just an FYI."}
{"text":"From the outside the place looks like a Texas road house...which was the reason to check it out in the first place, unfortunately...once you step inside the similarities end right there, 
No don't get me wrong, the place is nice, top notch decor but.....it has an identity crisis, its not what it appears to be, and as one that been to many Texas road houses I was highly disappointed. ,first off, its more of a restaurant then a bar, 2nd, poor draught selection where the most interesting beer is a Newcastle.....A Texas themed bar with no Shiner on tap? sad, very sad.
Moving to the food, Ordered the artichoke dip, surprisingly advertised to contain Texas cheeses, funny....in all my years as a north Texas resident I never heared about such a thing.
Anyway, it was bland and flavorless.
Service: mediocre and needs improvement
Will I be back? no thanks, I rather go to Steiner's 300.feet away.better everything with a real happy hour."}
{"text":"Another place I thought I had reviewed before. Maybe my reviews are disappearing. This is a Bronco bar for you football fans. Its a big space with a long bar full of gaming, comfy chairs and low tables for groups, and a raised dining area. Plenty of TV's for viewing sports, often tuned to 4 different channels on the 2 big TV's and then focused on the big game during prime events.

I like this place because of their food. The Dr. Pepper tacos are always good....sweet marinated tender meat with some nice salsa, rice, and beans. I also love their chicken fried steak, served with mashed potatoes and an ear of grilled corn on the cob. I like chicken fried steak and they do it right here. 

Full bar service available, and the girls behind the bar have always been nice, and attentive."}

About this place."}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars! Went for dinner with my husband, son, and his friend. The food is awesome!! The service was great. Our server was Kathy. She was terrific and friendly. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The cowboy theme works at RoadRunner. Great patio (probably one of the best and only in the area) and lots of space indoors. Gaming at the bar, nice variety on the menu and even (faux) bowling!
I took my family (from out of town) to eat here a while ago and they liked it."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went in yesterday evening to use the Groupon purchased in my first review. Server was friendly, but everything takes an extremely long time at this location. We came in sat ourselves, and it was at least 10-15 min before the server greeted us and brought menus. We made a drink order which took another 10 minutes to come out. We ordered nachos, and they tasted ok but there was barely any cheese on them. Not the worst place I've ever been, but definitely not the best."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and service.  The only thing I  would want  is for them to bring  back the chocolate pecan pie.  Miss that."}
{"text":"Great place for business lunches. Their Cowboy Cobb salad is delicious! Also they have a great patio area to enjoy when the weather is nice."}
