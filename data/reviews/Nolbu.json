{"text":"Not the greatest korean restaurant. Although I say that I do end up coming here twice a month due to its convenient location. However, I try not to come to this location because there are plenty of other great korean restaurants with great quality of food and great service. Nolbu's food is a hit or miss with its big menu. I would not recommend majority of its chinese dishes (especially the noodles). Sushi is okay. and some of the popular korean dishes are good too."}
{"text":"Good spot to satisfy a late night Korean craving! Hot bubbling gam ja tang hits the spot on a cold night. Seating was comfortable, service was a little lacking but courteous. Could do with more sides! All in all a good place if you're looking for straightforward comfort food."}
{"text":"Good food, nice variety, fair price. Ordered from the Japanese menu only. Only disappointed in the whole meal was the side order of \"multigrain rice\". I was hoping for brown rice, but instead I got purple-coloured white rice with a couple of unandentified seeds. Wish they described what it is on the menu. It may be a well known item for some people, but informing other patrons of items and ingredients never hurts."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place makes it easy to hold a conversation, very cozy atmosphere and open until 3am. Friendly staff that speak little english (don't ask too many questions).   Great selection from Chinese, Japanese and Korean foods on the menu. I had the very good and very spicy pork bone soup (Kam ja Tang). My wife liked the sushi, sashimi and california roll dinner (came with a small salad and miso soup).   Must try the tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is my go to. I love the hours and the service is always quick. The korean food is amazing, the sushi rolls are 4/5, but still for a place that does both korean and sushi, they do a good job on both. The sashimi is excellent I have to say. Decent price point."}
{"text":"Their food is tasty I would recommend this place who want to try Korean food.  Good location and nice seating. Service is little meh because server was not nice sometimes but I can see the owner chef is trying his best to customer so that is good thing.  They have live flounder sashimi and seafood which I really enjoyed a lot. At the end of course spicy fish soup is coming I really liked that soup! Taste so nice and well done.  I am not sure about the quality of their japanese sushi or roll  but I am sure They are doing good job on Korean food.  They have nice sapporo beer on tap which is good priced."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and enjoyed their late night menu since they're open until 4am... but since ordering spicy salmon rolls and tempura last night, my fianc√© and I have felt extremely sick. We will not come back as getting food poisoning sucks (100% certain it's from here) and I see that there are other reviews where people have also gotten sick from eating here."}
{"text":"Three stars out of five: just passed  The food is actually good there and the environment as well, but what makes this restaurant weak is the service."}
{"text":"Friend recommended us to try. Food wasnt WOW but the selection was good. We came on mothers day night and surprisingly there were very few tables.  However their food was great. Price was average. We ordered a wakame salad, takoyaki, fresh tofu, beef and seafood hotpot, Toronto roll, and steamed pork belly with vegetables.   Takoyaki, my all time favorite food, was a bit on the smaller side here. It was a bit too crunchy on the outside, and dark. However, it still tasted good.. So I'll let the color slide.   Toronto roll had a BIT too much cream cheese. I love cream cheese but my friends dont. Even I would admit there was a bit too much and it overpowered the rest of the sushi. I still liked it though :)  The hotpot was good. For a two person portion it had a lot of things! Beef was pre seasoned so even without the broth, the beef was tender and seasoned to taste. This was probably my favorite dish there.  Steamed pork belly with vegetables. This was a DIY wrap-like item. They were very generous with the amounts of pork belly given. The vegetables and sauces that came with it were also very good.   Overall, portions were generous and I would definitely come back.. We had a table of five and for JUST under 20$ after tax and tips, we were all very full. Just need to know what to order maybe. Great place, great food.. Service.. I've heard they always have different servers."}
{"text":"Nolbu has a pretty extensive menu, great deals (like cheap oysters on Thursdays) and a nice lunch special where they don't downsize the sushi rolls. The customer service style is laid-back and so just relax and enjoy. The sushi is always fresh and the appetizers are great. I like their miso soup here, too and great choices for sashimi. I order here like twice a week and always try new items. You will always see the regulars--this is a gem in the Yonge/Sheppard neighbourhood! Oh, and the prices are very fair especially considering the generous portions you get!  They are also very child-friendly and catered to me quicker with a little baby. (They have high chairs as well!)."}
{"text":"This is more Korean not Japanese, service is very slow, it took 10 minutes to order and 25 minutes for sashimi to arrive. how long does it really take to cut the fish and make it sashimi ?!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason we are ordering food here is because of being 24hrs. There is a lady that seems like being the owner of the place and she doesnt care about anything but money . I dont like the cali roll in my bento box because its has no nutrition value, so I always change the roll with some other roll of exact price in the menu ,but here she's trying to charge us for it,even if its the same price roll ,also she's not willing to put a six piece roll in the bento box even when she's charging extra ,she's putting a 4 piece roll instead of a six while she already charged me for an extra 2-3 bucks . She's a horrible person to deal with and being very rude all the time ,like when im asking her to serve me my food the way i want it she's like : this is it , want it or not? And sadly i have to get it because as i said earlier this is the only place around that serving sushi until 3AM. If this restaurant is not your only option ,dont even think about it .there are plenty sushi places around that they are pleased to serve you , the way you want your food( moto sushi is my favorite )  I wish I cloud give this place 0 star review."}
{"text":"Just order roll lunch A to pick up, got a great salad and miso soup with 12 huge pieces of fresh california and salmon avo roll! SO FRESH and tasty all that for just 10$ great deal!"}
{"text":"I do not know how this place got 3.5 stars. Well I just finished my dinner here and I can say if you are looking for sushi stay far away from this place. My bill came up to around 85 dollars after taxes and I can tell you its the worst sushi place I have ever eaten.   I ordered 5 oysters to start off my meal and it literally as small as a ginger slice. Then came my salmon sashimi which was warm. Finally the sushi, I'll let the photos explain for itself. In the end if was not worth the money. 3.5 stars average is way to generous, I honestly can make better sushi myself, that this! The rice was ROCK SOLID. I havent tried their korean food, but if you want sushi or oysters stay FAR AWAY from this place."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing with the black bean noodles as on the menu it indicated \"fried\" but as it landed on our table, it was not stir fried and you just mix it with the black bean sauce.   The oysters were $2 Malpeque, quite salty. The pot lights were too bright in the dining room. Too many other better restaurants around the area. Probably won't come back for awhile."}
{"text":"I went to Nolbu as my friends who live in the area really like the food and go there quite frequently. I went for dinner and was definitely disappointed by the food quality. My group ordered a sushi boat, tempura, and a dynamite roll and everything was less than mediocre. The food was edible (did not get us sick) but I've had much better tasting rolls on portion sizes at much cheaper places. Unfortunately, the fish for the sushi was not that fresh (a bit less than ayce level), the rice on the sushi was breaking apart, and the tempura was just not great. On a side note, I went with an Italian and Jamaican friend (I'm Asian) and we were the only group with non-Asians so I definitely expected more.  Service was typical for the area - they have buzzers at every table and someone definitely came once we buzzed."}
{"text":"Came here around 1am with some close friends. My friends and I ordered tteokbokki, kimbap, and spicy Salmon sushi and jjajangmyeon as well some soju. Food was very good and portions were good. Kinda pricey for drinks and sushi but not super expensive. Waitress was also very kind despite it being late at night."}
{"text":"Came for my birthday lunch the other day, on the recommendation of a friend. Plenty of space at lunch, although parking was not fun. Our waitress was quick and efficient, and also very friendly. She spoke both English and Korean, so no problems there. The tables were clean and also fairly private. I liked that as well.   I had come with the intention of either getting their Asian Food Festival special (combo for 2 - side dishes, budae jeongol aka army stew, 2 rices for $24), or their lunch specials. We ended up ordering their lunch specials because we wanted to try something new. Yukhoe!  We ordered the soondae guk lunch special ($7.99), the bulgogi bento lunch special ($8.99), and the yukhoe ($17.99). This was served with three banchan: japchae (sweet potato noodles), kimchi, and sliced, seasoned fish cake. While I'm not impressed by the number of sides served, the quality of each was quite impressive. Much better than other places. Their fish cake tasted of fish, and not of starch like every other Korean restaurant I've had this dish at.   Soondae guk is Korean blood sausage and other assorted internals in a sort of slightly spicy stew. The broth was flavorful and the blood sausage and internals were delicious. This is exactly what I would want if I was feeling sick or sad or cold. It's comfort food.   The bulgogi bento came with miso soup which I'm told was quite tasty, a green salad that looked fresh, 4 pieces of California roll which were also fresh, although there might have been a tad more rice than we like on our maki, 2 fried dumplings, bulgogi which was slightly better than other places, and rice.   Yukhoe is Korean style steak tartare. Instead of diced raw beef, it's more like slivers of raw beef. It was marinated in sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and I'm not sure what else, but it was very fresh beef and it was very tasty. The tartare was topped with a raw egg yolk and was presented very nicely on julienned cucumbers and Korean pears, . The cucumbers were fresh and crisp and the Korean pears were crisp and incredibly sweet. It all went together very well and the yukhoe was very refreshing.   We told our waitress that it was my birthday and we were given a free basket of fried dumplings! I've never received dumplings for my birthday, but I'll take it!  Oh. They have live octopus on their menu. Haven't had that one yet, but I'll get to it eventually.  All in all, a very satisfying meal. I'm glad I came. I'll be back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their Jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup)!!! The soup is so flavourful because it contains sooo much seafood!! They even have lobster in it! A lot of places will have a few calamari pieces in there and call it \"seafood\" soup but this dish contains so many clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari! Woo!! The soup is not oily at all and the noodles are so fresh. Yummm..  I've also tried their Black bean sauce on rice, seafood pancake and chicken kampungki (deep fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce) and they're all also really good!! What's more, their soju isn't too expensive (~$10) and comes in different flavours too! Definitely try the grapefruit one :P"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (free parking)  which is so hard to find on Yonge and Sheppard area. Ordered the lunch special dolsoy bibimbap and dokbukki. Both were good but nothing special. Portions were good and even though we only had 3 banchan (kimchi, japchae and fishcakes). They were tasty. Kimchi was especially good."}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing special. They serve Chinese, Korean and Japanese food. Service is alright. However, I don't think I will ever come back here. Both me and my boyfriend didn't feel well after eating their food. ( We had 2 special rolls and sashimi platter). I guess the kitchen is not very clean. Don't come here if you have a sensitive stomach."}
{"text":"Average food and service, but this place being 24 hours will satisfy your Korean and sushi cravings anytime of the week, day, month."}
{"text":"Bought take away Spicy Salmon Rolls and Tempura Shrimp around midnight last night. Felt sick a few hours later. Definitely have food poisoning as of early this morning. Had to have been the takeout, because my fianc√©e and I are both sick. The only thing we shared all day was the takeout sushi. Will not chance eating here again.  UPDATE: Was contacted by Toronto Public Health - they are currently investigating.  UPDATE 2: This restaurant was given a Yellow rating (conditional pass) by TPH as of February 1, 2016 due to food handling and pest control measures concerns."}
{"text":"Great sushi for great prices! We split a assorted 36 pc party tray and it was enough for 6 of us. This tray includes california, tofu, dynamite and avocado rolls.    Staff members are really friendly and accommodating.  Their service is also pretty fast which was a bonus for not waiting 20+ mins like most sushi restaurants.  This restaurant is appropriate for casual settings as the prices are reasonable with great quality ingredients. I would definitely come back here to try out their Korean dishes.  Keep in mind their portions are also fairly on the large end so your tummy will fill up fast."}
{"text":"Went to Nolbu (love the name!) for my mom's Dae-gu-tang (spicy cod stew) craving and they got a thumbs up from my mom!  My mom has a difficult to please palate when it comes to seafood stews and albeit sparing usage of Miwon (aka MSG), she said it was probably the best tasting spicy cod stew she's had in Toronto.    I had the seafood soon du bu (soft tofu stew) and was not impressed with the quality of frozen mixed seafood used in the stew.  But overall taste was a ok.    My daughter (4 yrs old) enjoyed their miso soup and finished almost the entire bowl of rice with the soup that came with her shrimp tempura bento lunch.    The space is a little oddly laid out as there are two split levels that house banquet seating.  The basement where the washrooms are located is shared with a Karaoke place.  I got the feeling that Nolbu was more a drinking hole than a real restaurant but no matter.  As long as they serve up the spicy cod stew the same way, I'm sure I'll be back here for more meals with my mom when she's in town."}
{"text":"I've been to many different Korean restaurants and tried PBS and I've got to say, this PBS has to be one of the better one. My only issue is when I was in the restaurant, there were so many flies inside that I was shoo-ing them away from my face and my food and the workers must have notice but did nothing :(  I'm torn between the food and the sanitation, so I have to give it only 3 stars. Next time I'll take take-out only."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with two other people. There was no staff near the entrance then suddenly 3 people yelling, asking us how many people. Ordered a sushi combo and pork bone soup and it came pretty quickly (the Korean sides as well). The kimchi tasted a little funky (either really old or too fresh). The sushi didn't taste super fresh. The pork bone soup was good but also average. The food here is a little pricier than other places down the street.   The server never came to check on us. We had to try several times to get her attention. We wanted refills for our other sides and we had asked her 3 times. She came back one time asking what she could get us and we asked for the sides and water as we had already requested it and she never came back with it. In the end we finished our food and just wanted to leave.   The service just isn't worth the trouble. The restaurant wasn't busy by any means when we were there. The food arrived promptly but was just average at best. So many other places around the area that do it better!"}
{"text":"The BEST pork bone soup ever. Good price and huge portion. I probably wouldn't be able to finish it if I had to eat it alone.  We also got oysters. Honestly, oysters for $2 at Yonge and Sheppard, and it's not Nome, I was pretty skeptical about it. If it wasn't good, I would drop by Nome afterwards anyways. When they came, the size was decent. I've seen potato chip thin, peanut size oysters in downtown toronto, so I was pretty happy with how it looked. And don't expect your fancy layout for the condiments..they were all put in those opaque, ketchup for hot dog stand bottles. But the oysters did taste decently fresh and I was pretty happy about that."}
{"text":"Visited here last night with my girlfriend as we were planning to go to Nome but they were closing 2 hours early because it was a quiet night...  Searching on yelp and realizing this place was just around the corner, I decided to give it a try! We had comfortable booth seating, service was good (even though we were asking for all sorts of customization to our plates) they still compromised considering it was 12:30AM...  The sushi here I'd definitely agree is not \"THE best\" however it tastes fine, and with their menu variety, being opened late, can't expect too much. They specialize in a bunch of different sashimi dishes including flake, abalone, octopus, and much more. The oysters were fresh, they have $2 oyster nights advertised but you only get to choose Malpeques of which you'll notice \"Marpeque\" on their menu. It's a nice spot to go to when you want to have a variety of sushi, Korean, and drinks late at night!"}
{"text":"Eh. Average Korean and seafood restaurant.   Tried this place as a recommendation after we got rejected by Nome around the corner. It is a very spacious restaurant with a lot of lighting.  We ordered a dozen oysters, a dynamite roll, and BBQ pork. The oysters were a lot smaller than expected, but tasted nice and fresh nonetheless. For $2 a pop, I wasn't sure if it was worth it to be honest. The oysters only come with Tabasco, cocktail sauce, and a few slivers of lemons.   The dynamite roll was a pleasant surprise. The tempura was cooked nicely and the rice was a good texture.   The BBQ Pork is expensive, but is a hefty amount. The sauce is sweet and spicy, but definitely needs to be spicier. It comes with a little lettuce on the side.   All in all, a pretty average seafood and Korean place."}
{"text":"I wasn't hungry but the company I was with was hungry so I got something small. I asked for rice cakes and an add-on of cheese for $1. When the rice cakes cake, I did not expect to pay $1 for a slice of cheddar cheese. I laughed it off but didn't complain, it was not bad. I'd like them to add shredded cheese next time so it melts faster haha."}
{"text":"Nolbu is the newest Korean & Japanese Restaurant that just opens at near Yonge and Sheppard.  The menu though a little predictable with the usual Sushi/Rolls, KamJaTang, Soon Tofu, BiBim Bap and more. But I found the food here is well prepared with quality ingredients.  They have a Grand Opening Special till end of April if you want to go try some of the dishes alone or as a group for their hot pot!  Soon Tofu with Seafood ($6.99 Grand Opening Pricing) was excellent. The tofu was really silky but the seafood, especially the squid was cooked without being rubbery at all!   There are a few \"free\" parking spots in front of the restaurant but don't count on getting one. There is a municipal parking lot right next door or if you come after 9 pm, street parking is free.  There is going to be Karaoke facilities in a month time or so... sounds like going to be a good night spot for some singing, soju and food!"}
{"text":"Three of us that went there last night had a flounder sashmi combo. We had to return dishes twice because they had disgusting food stains over them. Horrible side dishes. Tempura tasted like they used old oil for extended length of time. White rice we ordered separate were too mushy. Sashimi was not fresh at all. Oysters were too salty and tasted partially rotten, that we spat it out right away. Salmon skin rolls were bad too of course since they can't cook rice right. Slices of raw garlic was cut so thick and dry, that it looked like a 12 year old cut it with a plastic knife. Severs didn't bother checking on us. We had to wave our hands at the servers at least 3 times to order more drinks. Highly Not recommended."}
{"text":"We came here after wandering for a little bit in the area. The place is a little bit hidden but they have a nice big sign to deal with that. I got the salmon teriyaki bento for lunch. At the start, they give you several complimentary side dishes, which were decent. Be forewarned, the kimchi is very spicy. The salmon teriyaki itself was tasty but a bit firm. They did give a few extras that I didn't expect, like the california rolls and the the dumplings. Overall, everything tasted somewhere between okay and good. Nothing special, but it was a pretty filling meal for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them for the first time and the sushi was very good. I also had oysters extremely fresh. I will defiantly order from them again"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and every time service was different.  Some nights the service is quite good, then others just pure failure.  On my last visit, my waiter did not really understand English therefore made the ordering process kinda hard.  We ordered grilled mackerel, wakame salad and octupus/beef hotpot. I proceeded to ask for noodle to eat with the hotpot but waiter said no he didn't think they do that.  I asked if he could just ask, if not then I ll just have the rice. He came back later and said yes. Happy camper.  As our orders came, including the noodle.  everything was good until we waited and waited and waited for the hotpot which never came.  Eventually, we flagged down our waiter and asked about our hotpot.  He was like you want to order the hotpot.  I was like we ordered already.  He went to ask for noodles and forgot to order the hotpot.  So we had to wait another 20 minutes for our food.  By that time we had lost our appetite and ended up packing it to go.  They didn't apologize or offered us anything for the mistake.  I was quite disappointed because I had raved about them to my partner and dragged him there.  He was very unhappy. Hangry to be exact."}
