{"text":"\"You wanna meet for lunch in the foodcourt\" we asked our daughter who works at Southpark.  She instead suggested this place in the basement at Belk, Arthur's, which I had never heard of.  She is moving out of town so we will rarely be in Southpark again, but what a find Arthur's is!

How did we ever let the fast food industry take over our eating habits?  This is like the counters in the downtown drug stores we grew up with -- great burgers, sandwiches, and fries, in a very comfortable setting."}
{"text":"No matter when I eat here, the food is always good.  Great burgers and sandwiches.  And, on a rainy day, their soups are terrific.  They are fast and the food is fresh. It, is a good option for a meal while shopping if you are not a food court fan- and I am not.  I love to meet friends here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The real locals have grown up with Arthur's. I've come here with my family since I was in a stroller. 6-inch Turkey Grinder, every time. Do it. You won't regret it. Oh, get some horseradish sauce on the side. Thank me later!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and have only ever had the turkey grinder with fries. its so good i never want to try anything else. This is one of my favorite restaurants, the sandwiches are amazing, fries are SUPER fresh and it's quick. It's an AWESOME option if you're at southpark and want something in between cheesecake factory/maggianos and the food court."}
{"text":"Not very good.  Our group had a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato, a regular grilled cheese, a Carolina burger, and a Southwest wrap.  Everything kinda tasted like it was cooked on a dirty grill.  Not the worst thing I've ever had but really surprised this place has 4 stars.  Maybe today was an off day..."}
{"text":"Been a customer for years because of convenience.  Most food items are good, but they used to be excellent..  I do wish they would get a toaster oven to heat grinder hoagies....microwaved bread is tough!   Reuben's are skimpy....bits of meat...mostly sauerkraut which makes a soggy sandwich.   Burgers are tasty.  Asian salad is best salad."}
{"text":"I've recently been there twice. I got a burger that was okay, and also a turkey grinder. The turkey grinders are usually better than what I had the last visit. It was pretty bland, which made me reach for the mustard. I go back and get the Gulden's packs. On two separate occasions no one at the table could get a pack open. So then the choice is the mustard containers, which were all very nasty. They had obviously been filled repeatedly, but no one is cleaning them. I don't know if I can go back, as I'm gagging just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Decent place for sandwiches and such. But very disappointed in the coffee. Served lukewarm. Not something I had experienced here before. Should have stuck with their Dilworth's coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a Charlotte institution... it has been around for a long, long time.  Back in the day, Belk Southpark had 2 dining options.  Arthurs was located  downstairs for the younger, hipper crowds and  the Barclay Cafeteria  upstairs was a favorite of the \"blue hairs\"  (like my Grandmother).  

I always loved the atmosphere and food choices at Arthurs.  I definitely recommend giving them a try instead of heading down to all the chains in the food court. 

And if you are not looking to eat, but shopping for wine instead, definitely stop in because these guys know their stuff and have a nice selection."}
{"text":"I  read on their Facebook page that they just celebrated their 37th birthday, cool... happy birthday Arthur's!  Arthur's is a great little wine shop tucked away on the bottom floor of Belk, being southern, I was flabbergasted that you could buy wine at Belk!  

There may be a few folks that would rather be kicked in the head than go to the mall, but you can drive behind Belk and park in the garage, right in front of the door and Arthur's has a few 15 minute  parking spots.  So you can just run in and grab something.  Plenty of knowledgable staff if you get stumped on your decision making!

They also offer classes, it's well worth getting on their email list, it's something fun to do.  Last night they just had their yearly Champagne tasting.  Much fun.  I do find that they have paid tastings and free tastings.  I prefer to go to the paid tastings, they are more generous with the wine when it is paid.

More people know Arthur's has a cafe, there is a reason.  Great soups and sandwiches.  A lot more healthier choices than eating in the food court."}
{"text":"A well kept secret! If you are looking for wine treats, you have to check this out. It is like a little wine store located right inside the department store. They do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff.. I have only just peeked through the glass, but YUM!"}
{"text":"Had a great Cheesesteak with the fries!!! It was excellent!!! The had a line of people waiting when I arrived but the line moved very quickly. My wait was about 10mins. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Arthur's is in the process of improving their Wine Shop.  But walk past the renovation and eat at the deli.  Love their grilled pimento cheese sandwiches and grinders."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesesteaks, burgers, friendly people, and their ranch is top notch.  Shout out to the Balsley family for running an amazing Food & Wine business for nearly 40 years!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't know about this gem for the longest time. 

For your basic deli food, this is all you need! 

I got the Grilled Chicken Panini with fries and it was the bomb diggity. I loved the avocado in it. And the chipotle sauce was delish. I loved the fries. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Definitely add some seasoning salt to bring it up a notch. They also have vinegar which is a nice touch. Great selection of condiments.

Only criticism is that the service wasn't the best. It was merely good. The staff seemed really indifferent and not at all friendly. However, it is a deli so service isn't super important. 

Anyways, I can't wait to come back and try more of the food!"}
{"text":"It has taken me 8 years to discover this place. If you are looking for a casual, old-timey hot deli this is your lunch spot. 

It's in the basement of Belk tucked behind the house appliance section. It is an open cafe where you order while waiting in line, pay at the end of the counter, then grab a seat and your food will be delivered to your table.

It's a great place for a quick lunch. They have hamburgers, Reuben sandwiches, salads, and other cold cut sandwiches. 

I would say this would be ideal to hide away after a long day of shopping instead of the loud and often crowded food court. 

Customers range from newborn to grandparent. They even have a candy section that will bring back memories of when you were a child. Bring the entire family and enjoy a midday meal!"}
{"text":"I finally got the boyfriend to Arthur's!! We wanted to grab something quick and on the cheap in South Park before heading off to a party.  So I suggested Arthur's he wanted to try Sushi guru. However it was raining and we couldn't really find sushi guru (okay so I really didn't want sushi and I was walking in the rain and irritated about it) so he gave in and Arthur's it was.  

He is a convert... said why have we never been here before.  I just stared at him in wonderment because I have suggested it many times and he always says no SMH haha!! Anyways Arthur's has been around since before I was born. My mom and grandmother have been taking me here since I was a little kid and honestly it's kind of a comfort food thing. Yes the menu is just a deli grill kind of menu, no there is nothing special about it except it is always made to order and always tastes amazing!!! Oma (my grandmother) does love to get their quiche but I've never tried it. 

So yes many people will look at this place and think I just don't get it (maybe it's a local thing) but I'm telling you it's good especially when you just want to grab a quick simple lunch.  Plus the fries are always hot and fresh made to order yummy!! 

FYI the BF is rather picky and can be snobby about restaurants but he loved this place too ;-) just saying!!"}
{"text":"Arthur's is my favorite spot to grab lunch when I am at the mall.  The cheesesteaks are good, the meat has great flavor.  I usually order the asian chicken wrap or the salad.  I like the dressing that comes with it and the red peppers and chinese noodles give it a crunch.  The tea is always perfect. The food is always hot. The employees are helpful and always kind. There's lots of room in the seating area and I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"My first but certainly not last time here! Don't know why I waited so long! Damn. But NOW I know what all the fuss is about. It IS a very small shop.....but SIZE is NOT everything! Uh hem. This shop has an extremely good selection, with many \"boutique\" makers available. 

Craig, their Somm, was very helpful and of course knowledgeable, and they have tastings on the weekend. Me and my buddy Paul (the other bald Paul) tasted about 8 wines. I met a super nice couple and they shared a bottle of Belle Glos with us! All while we watched the Belmont race - No Cali Chrome didn't make it....:-(  

So I walked out with ONLY 3 bottles! For those of you who know me, I rarely walk out of a good wine store like this with less than a case. But I've been buying a lot of wine lately and decided to temper my purchase. I did get a 40 year anniversary of Caymus Cab. For some strange reason, this bottle is $12 LESS than their regular bottling......strange, but I'll take it!

If you're looking for that hard to find bottle, or just want a fantastic selection, come check out Arthur's!"}
{"text":"Old school charm, delish sandwiches. Cafeteria style service with custom options and delivery. My fave? Turkey reuben with kraut and thousand island of course, melted Swiss served grilled on rye. 

Everything is ala carte, so if you want fries or chips or another side, you'll have to order it or grab it yourself.

Nice alternative to typical food court offerings without sacrificing quality for price or speed."}
{"text":"Arthur's is my \"go to\" for lunch!   I work in the mall and Arthur's is my first choice.  The people are great.... super-friendly staff!   Clean!  Healthy lunch options!   Great alternative to the food court!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best philly cheesesteak in town. I know you wouldn't expect that from a place at the mall."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat while shopping at Southpark! It's quick, clean, reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Awesome service and staff, nice selection of sandwiches/salads and they serve wine that you can sip while shopping. Definitely recommend, skip the food court next time and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Always reliable. Great cheese steaks and burgers. Their marinated chicken in the sandwich and wraps is also really good. Great service, super clean, and always lots of room to sit at the many table and booths. Great for kids too!"}
{"text":"Somewhat hidden away in the basement of Belk at SouthPark Mall, this local favorite is definitely worth the hunt. It serves up excellent sandwiches, salads and simple lunch fare and has for years. We went with the standard cheeseburger and the turkey and provolone grinder with fries. All were hot and tasty.

The dining area is spacious and clean and reminiscent of simpler times. Service is friendly and fast. A refreshing departure from the opulence and commercialism of the surrounding Southpark area."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going to this place since my wife said it was so good. We ordered two really difficult items, chicken salad on a pita and a reuben.  
Well my reuben had barely had any meat and no 1000 Island dressing. The bread was soggy and you could not even tell it was toasted. 
My wife ordered a chicken salad on pita, minus lettuce and tomatoes. Well you can see where this is geaded, the wrap was delivered with both the requested items present. 
I know these seem like petty issues, but when you specify things when you order, you expect a degree competence when things are delivered."}
{"text":"We're in the Basement!  Basement in Belk!  South Park Mall...  Most of it's HOT!  Skip the Food Court!  

Very Good Sandwiches!!!  Best Place to eat inside the Mall for sure! ! ! 

Grinders!  A Grilled Sandwich is probably their specialty, I have mostly gotten the same one every time I have eaten here!  The first time I ate here was more than 20 years ago and the flavor has stayed consistent!  Trust me, Skip the Food Court and head to the Basement of Belk, turn left as soon as you get off the Escalator or park under the Mall and enter Belk that way!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Charlotte I have gone to this place for as long as I can remember. Located on the bottle floor of Belks it gets pretty busy during lunch time but I know why. The food is awesome!!

One of my favorite lunch spots, all sorts of delicious options some of my favorites are the chicken cheesesteak (if you like spicy definitely add hot peppers), one of the best grilled cheeses I have had, burgers, and the club. They also believe they make their own sauces huge fan of both the Honey Mustard as well as the Ranch.

This time I went with the ham grinder served \"hot\" on a sub roll with tomato, oil, oregano, & provolone cheese with French fries and an Arnold Palmer. A lot of people like the turkey grinder over the ham but not this guy.

A definite go to lunch spot when in the South Park area."}
{"text":"I have been going to Arthur's for years, since I worked at South Park.  The food has always been consistently good.  One of the best grilled cheese around, with bacon and tomato.  I was not disappointed today, with the grilled cheese.  Another good option is the hot turkey grinder."}
{"text":"Fox News Supporters 
Food is great. A bit pricey but fresh and hot. 2 stars for having Fox News on the TV. Bad."}
{"text":"Psst! Hey got a secret to tell ya'll about...

At South Park mall, they have fancy food court with a dozen of choices. If that isn't bag you have the California Pizza, Cheesecake Factory or Maggianos. The kids today growing up in America have it made when it comes to the mall dining experiencea. However, they are missing out on the old school department store diners. 

I am going to drop a little secret on you Charlotte and it is called Arthur's! This gem is hidden in the basement of the Belk Department store. Really,  I am not pulling your leg. If you take the down escalator into the ground floor past the small appliances, wedding registry and fine china you will found yourself starring at Arthur's cafe menu. 

First thing, the serve Cherry Coke and steak fries so they got my taste bud's attention. Arthur's is know for their great cheeseburgers (voted as best in Charlotte) and and check this out CHEESE STEAKS! I knew that would get your attention. For the ligher side, they have pretty tasty salads too!  Plus their ketchup and mustard is in the red and yellow plastic bottles, Old School style! None of those fancy little packets will be found here!

If you need to recharge with a quick meal at South Park drop in on Arthur's. But lets keep this secret between us, ok! ;)"}
{"text":"Arthur's is great! I always get their cheeseburger with fries and it's the best around! I don't usually like onions on my burgers but they dice and grill theirs and it's fantastic! It's a great place to go during your lunch break and read a book. My only issue is the check-out line can get a little backed up and their credit card machine takes a couple minutes to process. Other then that it's good!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Charlotte and on Arthur's.  When I was a child, it was Arthur's or the Cafeteria's in Southpark that were your food options while shopping.  They were also social beehives, where you ran into anyone and everyone on a Saturday or Sunday.

The go-to staples are the burgers, chicken salad grinders (made with turkey breast, btw), and the salads with the buttery homemade croutons and homemade dressings.  The sweet tea is divine, as well.  

I was pleased to see on a recent visit, that not much has changed.  The food is still excellent, many of the same workers are behind the line, and you run into folks you know.  

A nice addition - they now sell the \"perfect\" croutons by the bag for $1.99!"}
{"text":"Arthur's is a pretty good eat. I didn't even know this place existed, but apparently everyone else in Charlotte does, seeing as how busy they were during lunch. This is a sandwich shop, and they do a pretty good job with the sandwiches and fries as well. They are not too shy with the meat or cheese either. The food is quick and tasty and they have a pretty good variety if sandwich and burger choices. They also sell salads as well. The ambience is chill here, and most people come here for lunch in their work clothes, or seem to be retired. 

This place is cute and quiet. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I had the chance to try Arthur's from catering. The Asian Chicken wrap as good.  Loved the sauce and peanut flavor.  The chicken sandwich was okay but too much mayo."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch bite and was not particularly impressed. I had a turkey on rye that was decent enough. My boyfriend got a veggie pita that was served open face so it was basically a warm, wilted salad on top of a piece of pita. 

We also ordered a glass of wine each and must've gotten the final swigs of the bottle because it was kind of gross. I know gross is not the fanciest of words used to describe wine but it's accurate in this case. 

On top of that, it took a long time for our food to come out. All in all, a bad experience. I will say it was a nice change of pace from the crowded mall food court. So I guess there's that...?"}
{"text":"Skip the food court and head to Belk's basement for fresh, cooked to order food! Sandwiches, salads, and soups galore... On our most recent visit, I had the grilled chicken panini with a cup of chili. The sandwich was piping hot and full of great ingredients like an entire grilled chicken breast, avacado, tomato and a tasty chipotle queso sauce. The chili was perfect on a cold, winter day and proved great for dipping my sandwich (and Ted's fries) into. Speaking of Ted, he had the loaded chicken cheese steak. The sandwich was absolutely overflowing with chicken and grilled veggies! I had total order envy. Good thing he shares! 

So, long story short... You can't do better for a mall meal than Arthur's! Oh! And, if you're not looking for food but wouldn't mind a drink, you can grab a glass of wine from Arthur's and take it with you while you shop Belk. Sip and shop!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 20 years and will never stop! One of Charlotte/Southpark's best kept secrets! The cheese steaks or a grilled cheese both with the honey mustard sauce are the best ever! Cesar Salad is too die for! Grinders are very popular as well! Nothing is bad here! I'm serious! I don't even like Rubens but I would eat one with their honey mustard sauce! lol Family owned, Friendly staff, You will continue to eat their after your first time! the food is literally addicting!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I just found out about this place because this is the last place I need to visit on every mall trip. Boyfriend and I were at the mall early to beat the crowds at the Apple Store and didn't know if we wanted breakfast or lunch so we headed to Arthur's. Little did we know it was a huge restaurant! We got a loaded cheesesteak, patty melt and fries. Everything was excellent! Honestly one of the top cheesesteaks I have had in a while. The fries come out pretty bland but they have the best selection of condiments so you can add whatever you want (hello Lawry's and Malt Vinegar). The staff was nice and friendly too!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch here at Arthur's at Belk in the South Park Mall. I agree with the previous reviewer who referred to this place as a \"best kept secret\" - it really is, especially of the places to eat in the mall. 

You may not notice it if you don't know it is there, unless you happen to be shopping for china pieces in Belk. But once you find it, you'd be pleased with the menu - it's casual, and has just about anything you'd want for grabbing a quick lunch. The staff here is very friendly, and the format is pretty self explanatory - order here, pay here, then find a seat and your food will be brought to you. 

I had the asian sesame chicken wrap, and I was very happy with it. It came out nice and hot, and had great flavor. I think I paid about $6, and it was ready very quickly. This is definitely the place to go if you'd like a quiet lunch in the mall, and it without a doubt beats the chaos of the food court."}
{"text":"We grab lunch at Arthur's when we need a quick lunch in the South Park area. The sandwiches are good, but do not come with any side. My only complaint is the prices. A side of fries is $2.49, while sandwiches (grilled cheese) starts at $3.99. Lunch for the two of us: 2 grilled and cheese, side of fries, one fountain drink was $18.47.

We do frequent this place because of convenience and nice atmosphere in the basement of Belk's."}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot whenever I'm craving an egg salad sandwich. The restaurant is family owned and operated and as a result the quality of food and service is consistently high. I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"It took me about a year of living in Charlotte before friends clued me in to this best kept secret.

THE BEST BURGER anyone has served me in Charlotte -- right here, unbelievably, among the wine store casks and the Lenox china displays. It's a lot more low key than the crazy food court upstairs. Killer BLTs that you can address at eye level. Great grilled chicken and salads for light days, plus a selection of hard to find treats like Goldenberg's Peanut Chews."}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in town. The fantastic service and great prices make this a must visit."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here in over a decade. Burgers and grinders are my go-to's. Get a dill pickle half to cap off the meal.  Prices are on the high side but don't eat at south park mall if you're poor. McDonald's is right across the street."}
{"text":"Ok, Arthur's SO deserves and update and better rating.  Since 2013 I have been several times and although I still think the prices are high for lunch, I do love everything I have had. I typically still with the Turkey Grinders, add lettuce. Most recently I had a cheeseburger and fries. One thing to point out, if you say yes to onions they are grilled, not what I expected. Still good but I prefer raw onions on my burgers. As for the fries, I have had them several times and they never disappoint. Cooked fresh to order and perfectly salted."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here due to moving to Raleigh two years ago.  But my trip to Charlotte this weekend has me jotting down a few must-have pit stops and this is one of them.  Absolute BEST grilled cheese with bacon EVER!!  I know what your thinking, I don't really need the heartattack in a sandwich, but trust me, you will not regret it.  Can't wait for mine this weekend!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I was skeptical at first when my coworkers took me here but easily my favorite place to eat in the mall! 

I typically order a grilled cheese with bacon and fries on the side. The meal is great and the sandwich is large that I often get half to go! Even though it might be a day old, the grilled cheese is really good reheated. 

Another plus is they are good with my allergies (peanuts, nuts, & shellfish). I didn't think they would be a place that really cared but they made sure my food didn't come in contact with anything I'm allergic too. (Not that they have shellfish at this place but they do have peanut butter.) 

The place is also hidden away so it isn't super loud and busy like the food court. I would recommend this to any shopper at southpark mall."}
