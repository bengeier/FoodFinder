{"text":"Excellent! Great food all the time. Definitely recommending this place. When we're feeling really hungry and up for some great Japanese food, we do the buffet but on lazy days we do take out---they never miss, food is always great! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Really good tempura, hand rolls and sushi! We've been here for lunch and dinner numerous times and have never been disappointed. Clean, friendly staff and good food. The lunch is cheaper and not very different from the dinner except a few items, can't go wrong for $15 a person and good food! The tempura bananas and mango ice cream is a perfect ending to a great meal!"}
{"text":"Go here every week or so. I get the spicy tuna rolls. Dirt cheap and doesnt make me feel bad for eating out because its not overly bad for you. I do takeout but I would recommend the sit down to anyone who asked. 
Have had one or two times where my order was lack luster but overall for the price, its hard not to recommend."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place overall. The inside is very traditional with separated rooms of paper for each party of guests. There is a bar straight away as you walk in along with chefs dressed in traditional sushi chef attire. I've been here a bunch of times and I've never seen it very busy, even right before New Years. It's a very calm place to eat although not very exciting. It has a Japanese style while they also serve Korean and Chinese food at the same time. The food always comes in fresh and steaming in these black stone bowls. Sushi comes on bamboo. The hot dishes are quite nice as they are fresh but it is not very flavorful. I appreciate the bowls of sprouts and kimchi provided beforehand as we wait. The sushi is alright, its okay. The sashimi is still a little cold and hard sometimes. The sushi itself is not extremely tasty, even the dynamite rolls and california rolls were a little bland and mediocre. The staff are wonderful, the chefs great you loudly as you come in and when you leave. The waitresses are mostly all friendly, I've had one waitress rush us out one time though.  They are all either Korean  or Japanese and all of the waitresses know the food very well and can explain easily what is in the meals and how it is eaten traditionally in the country of origin. Ice cream is free, one scoop only and then its always a bit too frozen. The prices are cheap and awesome for the amount of food served for one dish. It's a very nice and quaint place."}
{"text":"Nauseous, after the 2nd bite of the chicken curry. Something with the chicken just didn't taste right....almost raw but didn't look raw. Neither did any of the sushi. I just wasted my money on all you can eat when you don't want to eat the rest of the food you ordered. Need to rethink eating at an \"all you eat sushi\".. I did like ordering from an ipad."}
{"text":"Poor service. After waiting for nearly 45 minutes, and making it very clear that I am HIGHLY allergic to sesame seeds, I received one of the dishes in my order made with sesame seeds. Needless to say.. it was taken back and remade, however staff should be more attentive, and quick."}
{"text":"They changed the cd finally! It's still pretty bad and repetitive though. Also the food is still great."}
{"text":"Was just there for lunch today.  And I was quite impressed with the service, quality of food and very reasonable price!

When we first got there it was not as busy but by the time 1pm hit there was a steady stream of people.  But the growing crowd of people didn't have any effect on the quick service that we received.  As soon as we were ready to place our order there was someone to pick it up.  If we had an empty plate on the table it was quickly picked up.

Food was fresh and very flavourful.  Really enjoyed the seaweed salad, spicy chicken, tempura and bulgogi.  

Definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"As for an all you can eat sushi place, it is sub-part. The food quality is not excellent, their online menus vs what is offered for all you can eat are not accurate, and the cuts of fish/quality is not great. It is a place you go to indulge in great quantities not quality. Would not recommend. Bathroom was really messy as well and difficult understanding waitress :("}
{"text":"Never have I been more pissed off at a restaurant before.
I will later describe how horrible their service is but first let's get the other stuff out of the way.

Ordering system:
We went for lunch and we got to use the ipad. The price is no longer the same as the menu picture on Yelp. Lunch is now 15.49 I believe.
Food:
The food is okay. It's not amazing but it's tolerable. A good variety of sushi, small variety of rolls. The non-japanese stuff looked pretty bad on the ipad so we avoided it. The fried stuff were all pretty fresh and the food came fast. The edamame was definitely soggy and limp- feels like it's been boiled over a few times (it's just plain mushy)

Service:
Let me get something out of the way first. I always tip. I've been a waiter before and I know it's not easy. A little busy and I get ignored as a customer, or a 16 year old who hasn't learned how to treat a customer properly, I understand. Food came slow or even a bit cold I can also bear with it. What I can't handle is humiliation.
It may very very well be that particular waitress, but here's what we experienced:

We went in the restaurant around 2pm- there was not that many people in the store.
We were shown to the table- no greeting no smiles nothing but whatever I'll take it.
The waitress asked us for anything to drink- \"Anything to drink?\"....\"Water?\" - The only 4 words out of her mouth- during that time giving the most impatient look on her face, then walked off. Sure I can take that.

That day my wife had some allergic reaction with her hands so I was feeding her everything. We ordered the miso soup and got it in a bowl with no spoon. Normally I'd be okay with drinking right from the bowl. That day I asked for a spoon because I didn't want to burn my wife. Me \"May we have a spoon please?\", waitress *pissed* \"You're supposed to drink that with the bowl\" *walks off*. Really?... You can't just give a spoon? Okay forget it. Asked the 2nd waitress but got the same response. However the 2nd one at least said \"if you would like one I'll give you one\". Great thank you.

Going back to waitress 1 - every time she serves, she half throws the plate onto the table. Each plate goes on the table with a *clunk*. Rude but whatever. I'm still okay at this point.
Here comes the worse parts:

My wife and I were having a nice conversation. This waitress comes up to us, interrupts us and in the most negative tone- \"If you're not ordering on the Ipad then turn it off. It wastes its battery\". No \"please\", no \"excuse me\", just \"DO IT\". At this point I'm a little pissed to say the least. But let's keep going.

Lunch hour is almost done. Normally in other restaurants they let you keep ordering if you will stay. This place requires you to order before lunch time is over. So the waitress comes up- \"Are you ordering anything? I have to take away your ipad now\". I said \"yeah just for ice cream\" waitress- \"Do it now and hurry up\". Okay... She's getting on my nerve now.

When it came time for payment- I looked at the bill: 39 dollars?... No matter how you calculate it- 31 dollars for two people + tax is not 39 dollars. So here I saw it- the 10% service charge.
I was fairly upset- I was at one point not considering giving a tip but now I have to pay it since it is probably \"habit\" in this restaurant. I didn't want to challenge because I just don't like to get in arguments so I paid it.

At this point another customer came up to pay with his son- 2 people lunch for 36 dollars, different waitress. I glanced at their receipt and there's no 10% service charge.

I challenged my waitress and she said \"you have to pay the 10% tip. It's what you need to do in Canada.\" I'm Chinese and she probably thinks I'm a foreigner. I've been a Canadian citizen and living in Canada for 13 years. Are you kidding me?
I told her \"Why is it mandatory on my receipt and not on the other customer's\" and she goes \"Well he paid it didn't he?\". I said \"I at least want to have to option of choosing to give you a tip or not\". 
At this point she starts getting really angry with me \"Well you are gonna tip? Okay I'll remove this 10% off your receipt. Insert your card and pay that tip!\" *Shoves the credit machine at me* \"Put in your card\" and shows me the \"Tip amount\" screen on the machine. I said give me my tip back first then I will decide. But this woman is adamant in taking in my tip and kept saying \"You should know better living in Canada. Everyone tips. You not tipping is not right and rude\". I stood there and just waited for my tip. At this point she starts rambling Cantonese to her boss, then finally giving my back my 3 dollars and told us \"Don't go out to eat if you don't tip\".

3 dollars was nothing to me. But this was about principle. I don't care how the other waitress are but I have never hated a dining experience so much in my life."}
{"text":"Some of THE best sushi I have eaten.  I love the little sushi pizzas and the hand rolls are to die for.  Trust me, having lived in NYC and Mississauga, this is pretty damn good for the North American version of sushi.  Their pad thai noodles are alright, not the greatest though.  The place is a little bit sketchy, but that adds to the overall atmosphere of the place.  My friends and I love going there to have a nice lunch and chat.  Can't wait to meet them up there again!!"}
{"text":"The worst Sushi I've ever had! Bad old oil used to fry, bad service, bad taste, and I got sick after. Don't even think about trying it."}
{"text":"It was a decent sushi buffet. The wait for each order was reasonable.
There was nothing special and there wasn't anything particularly amazing (however, the fried bananas were pretty delicious, I'll give them that)

The total of the weekday lunch came to approx. 17 dollars."}
{"text":"It really is a hit or miss with this place. We used to order from this restaurant about 3 times a week for lunch (at work). 

There are times the sushi did NOT taste fresh at all and had a few problems with having our order come in just as we had requested. Since the prices were decent for sushi, we continued to order from Kanda. 

As the previous reviewer mentioned, successfully placing an order over the phone really depends on who answers the phone. If you do place an order, make sure to verify your order (twice at least!) before you hang up the call. 

Unfortunately, two awful experiences has prevented us from ordering from this restaurant. We found a fly in our miso soup and a strand of hair in our salad. 

Please order with caution."}
{"text":"**UPDATE: WHY I WOULD NEVER GO BACK!
Old review:
The buffet for a weekday lunch is around $14. You get a decent selection of rolls, sushi, tempura, terriyaki etc. There are no premium rolls included in the lunch buffet (e.g. Philadelphia roll) and there are no sashimi. The quality is average but ultimately it's worth what you pay for.

**NEW REVIEW:
My old review remains true for all parts. What I didn't talk about was service, which is the reason I would never go back there again. We usually went in groups of 2 or 3 people, and we always wondered if we got all of the orders we wrote or not. In most cases they just got away with it. Last time we went in a group of 6, and I am 100% sure they didn't bring half of what we ordered. We kept bringing this to their attention, and they told us to order again. I NEVER GOT MY RED DRAGON AND SALMON HAND ROLL, among many other orders. 

When I spoke to the supervisor, she said the waitresses had brought all of orders, but we can order more if we want to. If it wasn't for my 1-hour lunch break limit, I would have stayed there until I got everything I had ordered. 

We offered to pay half of the bill, since we received half of the order. Of course my offer was declined. Last time for me. You folks enjoy the nasty service (despite the good-quality-for-money-you-pay)."}
{"text":"Great sushi, service is fast. Lunch is also very cheap but there are not as many options as other places."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is quick and the food is great. It's cheap for AYCE. The iPad is easy to use and great to use since I constantly like to order more food. Love the desserts, especially the mango pudding! This is my favourite sushi place."}
{"text":"OK, this is a good / bad thing.  The food?  Excellent.  I love it.  It is right on my way home from working out.  I stop in and pick up Sushi as a post workout meal, sometimes Sashimi.  Either way, I love the food.  They also do take away and delivery.  This is where it becomes dicey.  Calling in is a bit of a crap shoot.  You never know who will pick up, and sometimes getting the order correct is tough.  I don't think the order has been 100% on a call in for delivery, yet!  I have never eaten in the restaurant, and have always been there after 9PM, so I have no idea what it is like during the busy times of day.

But, the Sushi/Sashimi is fresh, and I have no complaints about that.  Service ...."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes and yes. Please go here. I came today for the first time.  Petite  beautiful girls. Bring you to your table.  They leave you with an iPad tablet from which you order your food. Amazing food. Good food. All you can eat is 24 dollars.  The dessert  is amazing.  I'm back tomorrow.  Probably everyday.  It's a bit to close to my place.  I might get addicted. I better not go back  the service was perfect. ."}
{"text":"Upon a craving smashing itself into my life, I decided it was time I find a local all you can eat sushi place. Luckily, a Facebook post lead me with multiple recommendations here. Among the suggestions was one of my Asian friends, which only confirmed my selection.

Tucked around the back of a small shopping area, with lots of convenient  parking and a hospital AND walk in across the street (for those who are allergic to fish and plan to find out at their first sushi joint)! 

The service was amazing, as soon as I walked in I was greeted and offered a drink as well a menu. (All you can drink soft drinks as well) This place has quite a large menu as well as an alcohol section which is handy for first timers requiring that courage. Very friendly and as soon as I finished a dish, they were on me like white on rice to take it away for me.

The work space and eating rooms were incredibly well kept, and all of the wait staff and chefs were tidy and well kept, groomed and very professional. That being said, the food was top notch and I would definitely recommend this place to sushi lovers.

- funny story. Two older men in their 50's came in shortly after my girlfriend and I. Sure enough, a young Asian girl serves them and immediately fulfilling stereotypes, the white guy asks the waitress if she's been a naughty girl, after seeing she looks uneasy he once again says, \"oh you are a naughty girl\". Did I say funny? I meant creepy."}
{"text":"Kanda is my favourite AYCE joint in Mississauga. Sure, they're not \"super modern\" with their atmosphere but I don't care about atmosphere when there's delicious food being served.
I've been here more times than I can count and they've been pretty consistent all throughout.
Their customer service has even improved over time."}
{"text":"The quality fish for an AYCE place is pretty good. They were very attentive, quick, providing amazing service which can go a long way! They went above and beyond for my little brother's birthday. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was really bad and the food was not even good. First off, when we asked if we could be seated at the booths, the server insisted that my friend and I sit on the small table, when there was no one else there. Many of the food that we ordered never came, and they gave us less than what we ordered. The shrimp tempura was undercooked, and their food taste and look like the person who made it doesn't care. It's not worth going here, especially since there are other ayce Japanese places in Mississauga that provide better service, food, and experience for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible.  

We came for lunch. Made an order using their iPad.

At first we received items that we hadn't ordered like soup or such. And we told the waiter and he simply said \" just eat it\"

We just ignored that and told him we won't eat it and don't want to be charged for leaving it.

Then as we waited a whole bunch of rolls came in but none of which we ordered!!!

They just threw random food on our table and thought we'd eat just about anything they gave us."}
{"text":"This is a very basic/mediocre AYCE sushi. Especially compared to all the other ones in Mississauga. This is the first time I've been in a longgggggg time and it's still just \"ok\". It satisfies my sushi craving just enough! I just happened to be in the area and was craving sushi so thought I'd give it another try!

I meaaaan I would still eat here if I had to....for get togethers or something but would prefer somewhere else. I came for lunch so it's natural that options are more limited compared to dinner but still just ok."}
{"text":"I went here a few times last year, and it was fine. As others have said, the price is very reasonable, the quality of the food is fine, the selection is great, and the dining area is clean (lots of windows, so a lot of natural light and open space during the day). 

The decor is a little dated, but it's an AYCE joint, not a high-end dining experience. Realistic expectations people! lol...I also found the staff to be friendly/polite, and the service was fine, but obviously not quite as quick when the place was full."}
{"text":"My local sushi place - located in the plaza at Hurontario and Queensway. 

I order take out from them quite often - call them directly to order and pay with cash, you get 15% off. 

The food is pretty good - dishes were tasty and fresh. Value for money is pretty great as portion sizes are quite large, but expect your sushi and hand rolls to be majorly padded out with rice. (Keeps you full, I guess.)The bento boxes are a really good deal, as the dinner sets cost about $10 and you get meat, rice, gyoza, sushi, miso soup, and salad! 

The interiors are alright - clean and spacious - I've never seen this place fully packed so there's no worry for wait times. Service is pretty good although some of the staff do not speak English...only Chinese. Apart from some communication issues with a dish we didn't order, they were attentive and dishes arrived quite quickly. The AYCE menu is on ipads."}
{"text":"The menu needs more variety and the new group of severs needs to smile and be more customer friendly. The food tastes good but dose not keep me wanting. It has gone down in its over all quality.

Two of us spent $40 excluding the tip. Cindy is probably the most pleasant server. The others throw the dishes at you rather than place them on the table.

The orders did come quite fast and fresh. However, the place was pretty empty soon as they opened on a Saturday. The Banana Fritters once was a full Banana and today it was just two tiny pieces. Disappointing.

The Restaurant has always been clean. Not noisy and very calm today.

Overall I was quite disappointed and dissatisfied with the visit. I find it difficult to recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I highly doubt that you would be driving down on Hurontario south of Dundas looking for sushi. There is a microscopic chance that you would ever make it as far as the hospital.

If you step into Kanda Sushi, your expectations are immediately lowered to a grave. The decor is comparable to a family-run Vietnamese restaurant. There is natural light (which for some reason is unknown to many other restaurants serving food from the land of the rising sun).

For the most part, you will get yourself seated. The waiters may ask to start you off with drinks, which is included in the all-you-can-eat menu (big A+ for this joint). You will also do most of the ordering on your own. All you have to do is open up the menu, pick some numbers, write down those numbers on the notepad and write how many numbers of those numbers you want beside the first number. Easy.

You can do all of this without ending the conversation you had with your group that started back in the car you drove in with. You can sit there with your completed order form, still gossipping with your peers, and wait for any employee to collect it from you. I literally mean it when I say that any employee of the institution will collect your paper. There are waiters, but even the table cleaners will snatch the form from you as they walk by. There is rarely any talking in this process, and the waiters won't inspire a smile.

The food doesn't take long to come. I have noticed that any serving of shrimp will take longer to prepare. My girlfriend and I usually start with shrimp and sweet potato tempuras. We are also huge fans of the spicy salmon and eel rolls. The salmon pizza is also something worth sacrificing room for. Unfortunately, they do not serve salmon sashimi during lunch, but dinner is a different story (I don't know the reason behind this, but the salmon sushi is decent enough compromise). The rolls are consistently made fresh, and everything else is delicious.

The waiters are usually watching every table like crows waiting for a dead carcass. They circle around the room in a group cycle. Any plate you had killed will be taken away almost immediately. It's a very efficient process. Model T production line efficiency.

Desserts are included with the menu, and (if you're like my girlfriend) you can order as much ice cream as you crave for whatever emotions you are going through. If you are sad, order 5 scoops of every flavour. If you are like me, you may order a single scoop of green tea ice cream in celebration for a great lunch.

For most people, the price for lunch during the week (excluding Fridays) are $13.95. This is much lower than most other places, especially for sushi this good. The value is good for people who just happen to need sushi, but the food is good enough to return at times when there are plenty of other (more elegant) options. I return on a weekly basis, and on every occasion it has been consistently good. If you have not found this place, it is definitely worth a try. You may see me for lunch of Fridays."}
{"text":"Awful. Food comes super quick but each item was a disappointment. Ever wondered how to mess up edimame? Make it limp and grey and don't bother to salt it. Asparagus with grilled pork?make that asparagus wrapped in a circle of gelatinous almost uncooked bacon. Awful! 
I could go on but there were 5 awful items that followed. 
And terrible value, at $28 plus tip for
Dinner including a Sprite. 

I will never ever ever return."}
{"text":"While it's nice to have AYCE Sushi 5 minutes from my parents' place, the sushi (based on a Friday afternoon 50% capacity crowd) is in a word... meh.  

The overall experience is pleasant and clean, and the rest of the Japanese/ AsianFusiony fare is well between good and excellent, but... a place with Sushi in its name needs to do better than stiff lukewarm unagi, teeny tamago wedges, and 40% kappa content of almost all my rolls. 

A couple of highlights are the Unagi, Salmon and Avocado \"Pizzas\" -- a double sushi quantity piled on top of a grilled flattened rice ball. I understand it's a Canadian thing:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi_pizza

Invisible bonus 1/2 star for complimentary soda and tea."}
{"text":"I love Kanda. For the price you pay, you definitely get more for your money and at a pretty decent quality. Don't expect the fish to rice ratio to be giant but the fish is fresh and the rice is good.

They do have a separate menu for lunch and dinner. Dinner is nice because you get more sashimi choices and oysters - a little random but I do love my oysters and they were pretty good.

Stay away from a lot of their deep fried dishes. They did nothing for. The deep fried scallops were fake and more dough than fish. Their noodles are hit and miss but I do enjoy their tom yum soup (dinner only and yes, I know, not Japanese but it's good)... My cousins loves their salmon belly. If you like grilled fatty fish...

The whole fish, is a whole fish. I know it sounds weird when I say it that way but you'd be surprised. The salmon rose is beautiful. Also try their pink lady and artic roll. A little different with the rice paper wrap but it's pretty awesome. Say no to the mango rolls... it's not mango but thick juice which is a bit strange and very sweet!!!

They also have take out and delivery. Every now and then, a single girl needs a fix and it's just a phone call away!"}
{"text":"Such a horrible experience. The place changed their management, and it's all about profit, not about quality. 

The food is crap. They pack on the rice to fill you up and use canned salmon for their spicy salmon sushi. Almost every single item has no taste, other than their fries (how can you screw that up?!) and ice cream (prepackaged). Miso soup is bland, house salad ... Wet lettuce! Fish is not fresh, 2 out of 3 people got sick. 

Oh yea, they automatically give themselves tip by charging your bill - there is no option to opt out.. Even with three people! For the average all-you-can eat sushi buffet price .. I'd highly recommend that you go elsewhere to have your meal."}
{"text":"Meh, it's acceptable.  There's nothing really wrong with this place but it doesn't give off that relaxed Japanese vibe you want when eating sushi.  It gives off more of a Chinese restaurant vibe as everyone is rushing, cramped tables, food flying out of the kitchen onto your table (I had one dish dropped off at my table and the waiter didn't even look), so this vibe kind if ruined the restaurant for me. So service/ambiance: 1.5/5

As for the food: sushi - 3/5.  Not the freshest (salmon wasn't pink enough, unagi seemed like  T&T quality), but rice was nicely seasoned.   The one thing I really did like was the fish egg sushi.

Hot food: we only spicy tofu and deep fried cheese wontons.  The wontons were nicely fried and the spicy tofu had a good kick to it. 4/5

Rolls: had the dynamite and spicy salmon roll.  90% filler, barely any fish.  1/5

Verdict: if you want a quick meal, go, but if you have real sushi cravings, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this place a lot until recently when they got my order wrong twice. The portions are smaller than they used to be and you get more rice with your rolls then fish, also the food especially kitchen food is very oily like the plate oozed with oil. The tempura was too thick,and they used old oil to fry it because it was a darker colour.The waitress would silently judge you and make a face of disgust if you ordered too much. I also didn't like the fact they gave me the additional 10% service charge for one person and claim it's for tip. I only tip if you provide good service and half the time the orders that came were not ours. Takes forever to get tea or another cup of water."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced for the amount of food you can order during the two hour buffet time limit. The food is great & trying new things can be super fun. 
The service can be slow & they will forget things you order from time to time but the quality of the food will makeup for it.
The setting is nice, you can sit near the window or in the middle but the bathrooms are dingy. 
Overall, when we entered the restaurant we were served quickly but as time passed it took a while to get our food & we had to keep reordering dishes since they never showed up the first time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I've been to. I'm not one sided because the price is so damn good, but because of the location and the service.

The employees were helpful and friendly. The selection of rolls, tempura and maki is surprisingly plentiful and it makes me happy to munch on edamame and sip on my miso soup. It's roughly $12.95/person all-u-can-eat Monday-Thursday. And $19.99 other days. 

This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went there at 1130 on rememberence day.  Needless to say, it was dead.  
Got the lunch ayce, which offered items you'd expect for an ayce lunch. 

They run on the traditional pencil and paper ordering system, which they will then punch into the system which will be sent to the kitchen staff. 

Our order was picked up quite promptly (seeing how we were the only customers there at the time, that would hopefully be the case), and the food came within a reasonable amount of time.

The food was subpar; nothing really stuck out.  The salmon quality was poor, it looked slightly old, as if they were taken from yesterday's supply. 

The quirks I look for in every ayce came out negative:

- For the salmon rose, they use one piece instead of two like other ayce restaurants with higher ratings
+  They served cream cheese wontons during lunch. That was probably me and my girlfriend's saving grace
- The music was horrendous.  We were there for little less than 50 minutes, and we heard Christian country music, the Friends theme song, country rap, Rihanna Christmas music, and others of that effect
+  I enjoyed their handrolls. Seaweed was crispy and they had a good filling to rice ratio.
- Service was mediocre/bad.  They were able to keep our drink orders up, but overall looked grumpy. 

All in all, a run of the mill ayce with REALLY BAD MUSIC. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Food quality is one of the poorest for a buffet. 

Been a returning customer for almost 5 years.
At some point in time during the past 1.5 years they have gone under some \"minor\" renovations, since then prices per customer rose. 

A meal for two at this all-you-can-eat used to be around $38 dollars plus tip. (Dinner price)

My last visit, roughly 2 months ago was $54 dollars plus tip. (Dinner price)

I won't be returning die to this skyrocket in price. 
Overall service was never that great since visit number one. 

The nearest competitor is a 15-18 minute drive away called 168 Sushi. That is where I will now from now on.  
It was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"While the sushi was tasty enough the rolls contained more fillers than sushi which ruined it for me and the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"My friend and I love their avocado pizza, give it a try! It  is cooked to perfection and the right amount of spice. We usually go for their ayce lunch, its abouts 18$ tax and tips in.

I don't really care for their cheese wonton, in my opinion they over fill it with cream cheese. I've had better. Also their customer service isn't all that friendly, and there's always one of their employees taking a nap ( no lie)  on a couch to your right when you walk in. I find that kinda odd and unprofessional."}
{"text":"All the sashimi and sushi are fresh!
All the deli tasty good!
The food deserves the price!"}
{"text":"Very... ummm... just okay. Nice inside, ok menu, nice enough staff, taste... ummmm... ok. With better AYCE sushi options nearby, I can't see patronizing this place again."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE. They get orders wrong a lot and are a bit slow but decent place"}
{"text":"Despite some of the negative comments ... I didn't see it.  Food, service and attitude of those working here was great.  Although the portions were smaller than other places, the sushi was very fresh and the ordering process was always quick.  Seating was quick too."}
{"text":"The quality of this AYCE sushi is absolutely horrendous. The rice looked like it was about to fall apart and the ingredients seemed to have been sitting on a counter for a week. Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"It's was my second time I come here with friends for s birthday party and its was amazing, the food was fresh and taste amazing the service was fast and I will visit again!!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer from day 1 and Kanda's done well. You know that the business is fantastic when they increase their prices every other month! (joke)

The finer details:

Ambience: Very spacious and clean for an AYCE sushi place. I always ask them to seat me in the cushy seats near the window. The interiors done up really nice, the servers are great; the music? not so much. They play some weird stuff at times. 

Crowd: Groups of 2, 3 and 4 - colleagues, friends, and maybe a few families. 

Variety: I like going for lunch. Minus sashimi and drinks, they have everything else an AYCE menu should/could have. Seaweed salad? check. Shrimp tempura? check. And good old SALMON on/in everything? CHECK! 

Verdict? Love this place and I keep going back."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes it's just ok, and even  though their sign says they open at 11 am don't bother, they open when they feel like it. So I wouldn't drive there unless you call first."}
{"text":"I ordered the bento box with pork cutlet and because i cant eat raw fish, i substituted all my sushi with the spicy crab tempura roll. The pork cutlet was average, little bit dry. The salad was good, had a nice unique taste and cut through the greasiness. The roll lacked in crab meat and had mostly the fried tempura batter, cant taste the crab at all. The miso soup was average. The gyozas were also average, might have been frozen and tasted storebought. Service was good and fast. Not sure i will come back or not"}
{"text":"Been to this place quite a few time . Some servers are really nice and friendly .But there were times the server was rude too .The food is really great .Love every bite . They are suppose to open at 11 am yet never open on time. Always late .Other than that it's a decent place to have a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Bland and Cold

The portions are what I expect from an all you can eat, small but respectable. All the dishes that should have been served hot were luke warm at best (fried rice, chicken teriyaki,  beef ribs). The white tuna with mango roll was the worst.  Rolls are normally served cold but this was not and the mango was actually a warm sticky mango sauce. 

Nothing was fresh and that is my biggest issue. I expect fresh made food when I go to a sit down restaurant.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE sushi places in mississauga but the service isn't that great. Occasionally they don't bring out something you order, or bring out someone else's dish. Other than that, it's a pretty safe bet if you want AYCE, and I don't think I've ever been disappointed. The Sushi Pizza is one of the best, and their Crab-Cheese Wonton's are served for dinner AND lunch which is rare...and boy are they delicious."}
{"text":"An iPad! The entire sushi menu for ayce is on an iPad. I love the idea and this is just the start of something...average. There isn't a huge selection but it gives you the basics: sashimi, maki rolls, hand rolls..etc. Prices are super reasonable: $26.95 per adult on the weekends and service is SUPER fast. Within 10 mins, everything we ordered was on our table. If you are looking to just binge eat regular sashimi, this place is your go-to. Fish was fresh and service is fast. Just eat and go."}
{"text":"So in some regards this restaurant is a 4 star and some it is three star.

FOOD: 4 star 99% of the time 

ATMOSPHERE: 2-3 star. It's not great, but they are slowly giving it an overhaul one thing at a time. So they are trying. But honestly what's better ...a fancy place with crappy food or a dated boring place with great food?

SERVICE: Great, 99% of the time. However, even though we go here a lot, we literally walked out once as the waiter at that time pissed us off and they ignored us and all our food went to anther table. So sometimes, bad service happens. The ladies on the dinner shift are for the most part nice. Quick and always have smiles and kind words for our two little children. They coo over the baby and help my son to eat or dote over him. 

The cheese wontons are amazing. The fish is very very fresh (again 99% of the time).
I don't think this restaurant smells at all like someone said. The sushi rice is addictive. I go other ones, hoping to try something new, and end up disappointed that it wasn't good as kanda.

We should be here less but we are here every week or two. So I would say the quality is pretty consistent. There will be blips with every restaurant but overall this place is a good solid choice. :)"}
{"text":"Went once based on reviews on a rainy weeknight and it was fairly quiet inside, the service was great and the food was awesome. I plan on being back again next week for my anniversary dinner and both me and my wife are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"This is an ok sushi place. Service.......... is questionable and I will leave it at that. The food is not too bad. The ribs are cooked just right and the sauce is good. Spider roll has way too much cucumbers in it. The shrimp that makes golden dragon roll is too small and too much rice. 

After this, I am still in search for the perfect Japanese Buffet in Mississauga. This was not it."}
{"text":"An awesome place for all you can eat sushi. The price is right, the service is excellent. Some of my favourites are the cheese wontons, Kanda shrimp. For rolls the Arctic roll and Golden Dragon roll are my go to's almost every visit. 
The sashimi portions are absolutely perfect and all (almost all are choices I make every time.)."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place out of desperation for sushi, but now with so many other options this one doesn't make the list! This is my least favorite sushi spot in Mississauga.

I find them to be more pricey than the other AYCE sushi spots and the quality is worst! Obviously there is seafood being served, but often this place smells horribly of smelly or cheap fish. The quality of food is sub par and the rolls tend to fall apart as soon as you pick them up.

Service isn't the greatest, expect long waits for your server.

I've retired from eating here."}
{"text":"OMG the food was amazing, was clean and friendly.
Everything was fresh and yummy. Not to modern but still loved it."}
