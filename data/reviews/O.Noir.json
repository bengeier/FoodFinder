{"text":"For those that don't know, O.Noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark. Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.  Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.  First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.  I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.  Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.  The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.  Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.  Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.  On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.  O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark..."}
{"text":"Went to O.Noir using a Groupon recently.  Restaurant Groupons are something of a scam.  I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.  I was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).  The food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.    That second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.  Too bad given my experience it's unlikely myself or anyone I recommend restaurants to won't get to experience his charm."}
{"text":"\"What you see is what you get\" This is definitely the case with O'Noir because you get absolutely nothing for the high price you pay. The food was bland and cold. Chicken had no flavor, the rice was mushy, and the vegetables tasted like they came straight out of the freezer.  The service was slow and infrequent. I felt like my glass was always empty. The wait for the food to come out was waaay too long for what seemed to be a microwavable dinner. Actually I've had microwavable dinners that tasted better. Save your money and eat in the dark in the comfort of your own home. Anything you eat in life will be better than O'Noir.  p.s. their employees ARE NOT blind as advertised."}
{"text":"Just went tonight and it was a really great experience. The service was also really good! I had the octopus (which kind of tasted like chicken for some reason), filet mignon, and the surprise dessert. The food was relatively good (could be improved therefore 4 stars) but I really just went there for the experience. Would recommended and would go back again!"}
{"text":"What an incredible meal and even more so...what an experience! My partner and I were really forced to communicate without any distractions. It was quite the delight discovering what was on my plate as I chose the exciting \"mystery menu\".  Humbling and delicious, now that's a gem."}
{"text":"Firstly I'd like to start off by saying that this concept is quite unique, and if executed properly (see Opaque in Cali) could be a huge success. However, my first experience at O Noir was not at all what I had expected nor indicative of a successful business with repeat customers.  Let's take a look at why from my experience.  Food quality: Sub par for $35+ per person excluding mandatory tip. The food was heavily salted and COLD. I was astonished to see other yelpers mentioning this which, for the price point, is unacceptable. When ordering seafood and chicken, neither should be cold unless it is served cold or you request it.  As a result of this I had severe stomach issues which I can only attribute to cold poultry and seafood.  Food portions: Again, not worth the money. I got the pesto chicken and there were about 5 strips of chicken on my plate. The green beans were plentiful as I opted out of the potatoes. The bun was, well mundane and could easily be replaced with fresh warm bread if they made the effort.  Mandatory tip required for dissatisfied customers: If customers are legitimately unhappy with their dining experience and have good reason, no tip should ever be required. Instead, the option to pass on tipping should be an opportunity for the business to look at their shortcomings and address/learn from them. This was not the case. In fact, the woman at the cash made no effort to listen to us and immediately went on the defensive, stating that portion sizes were standard and we basically had no idea what we were talking about, in a diplomatic way of course. Unacceptable!  These three issues totally ruined the experience.  However, here are some ways this place can redeem themselves. Here are my suggestions:  -Purchase a dedicated tablet/phone etc to send customers photos of what they were eating. This is both a fun way to show them what they ordered after the experience and to keep the business accountable with portion sizing.   -Heat up the food! Self explanatory. Cook it properly, serve hot. Simple and will save people a day or 2 off work from food poisoning.  -Grow out of the idea that this novelty sells itself and no effort has to go into things like purchasing quality food and taking pride in the overall culinary element of the experience.    Other notes: The visually impaired waiter was amazing and held the experience together. He should be commended. He was attentive and had a sense of humour! I wish him the best.   For those unsure about this place, I'd say wait until they make a push to improve things and make it known.  If they are savvy business people who are looking for longevity rather than a quick buck, they will."}
{"text":"I'd give O.Noir a fair 3.5 but I'll give the benefit of a 4. My first time!  O.Noir was a nice experience, but only slightly underwhelming. I used a Groupon (which can only be used between Mondays and Thursdays) for our meal.  The staff was friendly and very helpful. Each waiter seems to manage their own room, and they have a good system of having you navigate and get used to the surroundings.  The food was fair, but the experience in the dark is unmatched. I did enjoy my filet mignon. For those with lactose intolerance a word of advice: don't go for the surprise dishes and prepare yourself for the lack of dessert selection. Perhaps O.Noir can provide a non-dairy option or two.  Another note, try to keep your eyes closed during your time in the dining room, or else you'll find your eyes getting tired!"}
{"text":"I thought it was great. Went there for my birthday and was impressed. I had the chicken thingy with mashed potatoes. I'm very picky and don't like fancy meals much but my fancy meal was delicious utterly amazing. I loved that because you can't see the meal tastes all the better. And our dessert was great too I had the mousse it was great my parents had the cake but said it was dry"}
{"text":"I've really contemplated whether I should give 3 or 4 stars! Alas, my mind says 4. Here's the dealio...  You want to dine in the dark? Well, that's what you get here. As mentioned in previous posts, you choose your food and drinks in the lit, waiting area. Once your selection has been made, the blind servers lead you in, help you sit down and direct where you should put bags, coats and drinks.   I went with my brother, who is an self-proclaimed olympic eater. So immediately, I knew the food would be smaller portioned and perhaps not the finest of qualities. How did I know this? We were told to grab bread from a basket. It was warm, but it was a general roll of bread one would get from the grocery store or Costco. Those little oval dinner rolls... If they left a few in a basket I'd be more impressed, but we got one each.  We quickly got our appetizers, grilled calamari for each. It was really good. It was warm and saucy/marinated-y and decently portioned. I didn't really understand serving it with lumps of fresh cut tomato, the thought was quickly lost once I put that calamari in my mouth, I understood the benefits of dining in the dark. I could taste everything with extraordinary ability. I don't think I have the greatest palette, but man, this was just a great marinade. My brother and I joked that for people who don't really care for tomatoes, we kinda enjoyed them as well. I will say, it was hard to cut those slippery suckers in the dark!  For our mains, I got the pesto chicken and he got the filet mignon. My chicken was cooked really well. It came precut, as well as the beed, which was a huge savior. However tasty my meal was, I did feel it wasn't anything I couldn't cook on my own. It was with steamed string beans (can't tell if green or yellow or mixed) and oven roasted potatoes. I will say everything was warm (added in response to the few reviews before me) and really well seasoned. I dislike too much salt and was worried I'd be able to taste it after noticing the heightened senses I experienced after the appy. So while I wasn't impressed with the level of creativity regarding our dishes, I did like and eat all of it.  The few minor downsides.... We pretty much ate everything with out fingers, so our one napkin didn't last very long. Also, DON\"T WEAR WHITE/LIGHT COLOURED CLOTHING!  Additional upsides.... the music station was 90's/early 00's pop and hip hop. We were loving the Will Smith, Snoop Dogg, RHCP etc, mix. Another bonus, I could totally dance in my seat and not look a fool. Our server was also SUPER freaking nice. One of the greatest customer service experiences I've ever had.  I don't think I'll rush to go back, mainly because for the price I paid I do expect better food quality, but I did have a really good time!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience and great service.   Highly recommend.  Nasir was our server for a group of 19, and did a great job while having amazing patience."}
{"text":"Was completely dèisappointed...... waiting time was unbelievable long..... arrived 615 sharp. In the dark by 630. First course came 730!!!!! We finished appertizer. Super heavy dressing !!!! Few pieces of green that's not fresh!  my friend and i need to use washroom . By the time it's 755.  we came back WAITED longer. Main course arrived ..... the meat was super tough !!! . Napkins was super thin and rough...... like cafateria quality Napkins. .....I saw onoir replied in comment their napkin is thick and premium quality but that's not true at all.....table were sticky !!!! Cutlery were low quality . Sounds was so loud can't hear my group talking as more people came in ........ finally dessert.....way too much whip cream. .....and that chocolate cake taste dry and old......server took on wayyyyyyyyy too many table. Never came back to check on us !!!! At the end , when we go outside to pay for our bill  the staff that check us out say to us 18% is uaully the tips standard  !!! I am like .......I don't even want to pay 5 % tips with this experience !!!!!can't believe they have the guts to demand 18 % of tips!!!!!. I really think if onoir can improve on food quality (((that's the main thing to start!) I will still go back. I can put up with cheap napkin, sticky table, long waiting time for food. As long as the food is super delicious. Atmosphere I still give 5/5. Food quality 0/5. Our server 3/5. Staff that check us out 0/5. I honeslty would pay $100/person cost if the food is excellent , even with the same quantity of food i am getting. Hope owner and management really considerate our comment."}
{"text":"Booked this as a Groupon as it seemed like it would be a fun date night for my girlfriend and I, and we definitely weren't disappointed, as it turned out to be pretty much everything we expected and more. It would be worth it even at the full price, and we'll almost certainly go back again in the future.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no understating that you're dining in the *dark*. Pitch, black, inky, darkness. They ask you to turn off cellphones and avoid any clothing or jewellery such as watches that may illuminate or glow, and in our experience, everybody was pretty good in that regard. It was dark to the point that your eyes actually play tricks on you for the first little while until you've sort of fully adjusted and your brain has accepted that you're not going to be seeing anything for the next two hours.  The serving staff were polite and professional, and while it was more than a little disconcerting and even a bit spooky when first being led into the dark dining room, once we managed to get seated and the server described where everything was on the table, we got settled in pretty quickly.   One of the great things about the experience is that you don't feel at all rushed... the meal gets started pretty quickly as all of the seatings are generally at the same time, but you've basically got about two hours to get through a three-course meal -- plenty of time to enjoy the meal and the experience, and the food came at a completely appropriate pace -- not too fast, and not too slow.  As a concession to the fact that you're dining in the dark, the table settings are kept basic... You get a napkin, plate, fork and knife when you first sit down. Obviously no need for other ornamentation, and the server brings water and drinks to you at the table, holding them out for you to feel for and grasp yourself and then set on the table on the side away from the server. We had ordered a bottle of wine, and rather than bring the bottle to the table and expect us to pour and handle it in the dark, they basically divide a bottle into four glasses -- the server brought the first two filled and ready, and simply told us we could ask for the second whenever we were ready.  I had the arugula salad, and my girlfriend had the portobello mushroom appetizer. While it was a bit challenging to eat in the dark, that's of course all part of the experience, and you can't be afraid to get your hands a bit messy unless you're really that good aiming a fork and knife without the benefit of your eyes. We both had the filet mignon for the main course, which arrives pre-cut to save the trouble of wielding a steak knife in the dark, and then decided to go for the surprise option for dessert -- we ended up with what seemed like a walnut-mocha cheesecake, although we forgot to ask afterward exactly what it was. Either way, we both felt that the surprise dessert ended up being a better choice than the other standard options on the dessert menu, and it's definitely fun getting food in the dark and having to figure out what you're eating solely by texture and taste. It was definitely worth taking the chance, at least for dessert, but if you're feeling really adventurous, you can select a surprise for each of the three courses, which would make for an interesting dining experience overall.  In terms of ambience, the room was about what one would expect in a standard nice restaurant, with conversations going on around us, but not bothersome or interrupting our own conversation. In fact, the darkness provided a sense of privacy and intimacy that may not have otherwise been present in a standard restaurant setting, and both my girlfriend and I actually enjoyed just sitting there and having some serious conversations about the experience and just life in general which was made more interesting based on the fact that we were just disembodied voices in the dar (she was probably also making faces at me the whole time, mind you :) ).  While this may not be an ideal first date experience, it's definitely a great date night for somebody that you've known for a while, especially if you enjoy trying new things and have a good whimsical sense of what's fun and interesting."}
{"text":"Great ambience (both entering the restaurant and the pitch black), not bad service and the food was not bad.  After coming into the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were given menus but were not guided to a table or anywhere comfortable to sit and so we kind of just awkwardly stood until a group left their table. But the rest of the night went pretty smoothly.  We chose our meals from the menu and if you want to have the whole experience I definitely recommend getting the surprise!  Then, our waiter took us into the darkness and it was slightly dizzying at first to walk into because I've never been in pitch black for that long of a time before. But it was really cool trying to decipher where noises were coming from and what foods we were eating. When we needed anything, we would simply call the waiters name and he would come to our side to wait on us.  It was a really cool experience and I think the darkness actually makes the flavours all the more emphasized making the food seem amazing. Though the price is steep, for the most part, I would say the experience is worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. Presentation is non existent (since you can't see, I assume they don't put much effort into it) so you have to rely solely on your sense of taste, smell and touch.  I ordered the 3 course menu, which were all 'surprises' and when receiving each of my dishes, using my hands I felt around the plates to get a feel of what I was eating. To my assumption, I started with a salad which was totally dry and lacked any form of sauce. The main dish was a chicken entrée that came out luke-warm, didn't taste very fresh and over cooked. As for the dessert, it was a chocolate mousse - good but very very sweet. During the experience, there were huge gaps between courses where we were neglected from our server. From start to finish, with a group of 3, it took us 2hrs to finish up. Things are generally slower when you eat in pitch black apparently Overall, O.noir is an experience like no other. I would recommend trying O.Noir, not for the food, but for the experience. I would definitely not go back for a casual dining."}
{"text":"Expirience alone gets 5 stars. Unfortunately the food part of it was a bit more than disappointing. We brought my step son for his 15th bday, didn't tell him and his sister where we were going or what it was all about, so that part was fun. Service was also quite good except the long wait in between courses, not the servers fault though. This is not a cheap night out, so my expection on good quality was high. I didn't expect 5 star restaurant food, but thought it would be much better than it was. Very disappointing. All our meals were cold, not warm, cold. My husband's filet mignon was tough and full of fat. I wouldn't go back but I'm glad to have had the expirience. I'd recommend only if you are prepared to pay a good chunk of money for below average food but a super neat expirience."}
{"text":"Was at O.Noir yesterday with friends. The waiter never came to our table to replenish the water or check if everything is okay. And it wasn't okay. My friend ordered pasta with vegetables, but had no vegetables on her plate. Because you cannot see, you don't know if the waitress is around, so it is somewhat awkward to call her. I ordered a vegetable stir-fry and received green beans stir-fry with a couple of overcooked pepper and broccoli pieces.  After learning about our experience, we were still charged the above-the-guideline tip which were already included in the bill. It is very unfair to decide for your guest on the amount of tip. Will not come back. Not cool to take advantage when the guests cannot see what they are getting. This restaurant is not interested in providing exceptional service or being fair to guests. You do not get what you are paying for."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon deal so came here with a couple of friends. It was our first time eating in a pitch-black atmosphere so we were definitely nervous when we first walked in, but once we were seated we felt better. The starters came quickly and we were all pretty satisfied with what we ordered. I got the octopus and it was pretty good! But after the starters we starved for about 45 minutes because it took that long for our main courses to arrive.. I ordered a medium rare filet mignon but it was NOT medium rare at all. It tasted like it was well done. Also, even if it was in the dark I could still feel that the plate edges weren't clean. There were juices around the edges.. Even if the food was eaten in the dark the chef should've done a better job. I ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert but it was nothing too special. Overall, the food quality was only okay. Don't come here for the food.   The service was not that great. I understand that the waiters are all blind but our waiter (Gavin) held the plates right above my friend and hit her head EVERY TIME a new food item arrived. That is extremely unprofessional and blindness is not an excuse for hurting your customers especially if you're an experienced waiter there. Also, the waiters aren't in the room while you're eating so it's extremely troublesome if you need water or napkins or new cutlery.  The room was small, and since it was in the dark everyone talked loudly. I could barely hear what my friends were saying so exchanging conversations was definitely difficult. I would recommend coming here ONLY ONCE just for the unique experience."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience ever. I've been to a few restaurants where a few points in some areas of service were missing, but not in all of them at once. So, you'll be eating in a complete dark. And there's nothing fabulous about it, it's definitely less work for the cooks, as they don't have to work on presentation. I ordered pasta with vegetables, and there were no vegetables there at all. And the sauce was kinda spicy, which was not mentioned on the menu. My friends ordered vegetable stir fry, which might as well be called 'bean' stir fry as the only vegetables that were there were green beans. Oh, ok, for the justice sake I'm gonna mention that each friend had one piece of broccoli in their stir fries. So, overall, the food was indifferent. The waitress never bothered to refill our glasses of water, or ask how our food was. Now, when we were paying our bills, the woman asked us about our experience. We did mention all the mishaps that took away from our experience. She sympathized with us, but not only didn't give us a discount, but actually included the tip of almost 20% in the bills! I thought tips were voluntary; and they didn't do anything to deserve such amount. The idea of eating in a dark is bad enough, but at least the workers could make it just a \"different interesting\" experience, not a \"really bad\" one. I'm not coming back, and will never suggest this place to the people I like."}
{"text":"Really fun experience. Staff did an excellent job explaining and guiding us through the restaurant and meal. Our server's name was Nasir and he was very friendly and attentive without being overly assertive. I tried the surprise starter and meal with the chocolate mousse for dessert and all three were great. The surprise starter and meal really played well into the whole experience while your sense of taste is heightened in the dark. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"5 stars for the concept... i have never eaten in complete darkness 1 star for the food.  Everything was salty and tasted like we were eating cafeteria food.  I was not \"surprised\" by the \"surprise\" meal, it was kinda of boring.   1 star for the decor, it was a stuffy basement restaurant (not in the actual dark dinning room, but in the entrance bar area)  We ate late, so when we left we noticed that one of the servers who was leaving at the same time was actually not blind (not that it was advertised that she was but she was wearing dark sunglasses in the restaurant)... again Im not accusing just highlighting."}
{"text":"Our server was nice, but food sucks. I ordered cream pasta, but They gave me the wrong dish.  They didn't apologize and didn't offer me discount. I tried to eat what they gave me wrong instead of cream pasta I ordered,  but I couldn't eat even a bite. Food was terrible. Now I understand why they serve food in the dark. I'll never go again."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience! Our waitress was very nice and clear in her directions.  I got the Octopus salad, Fillet mignon with vegetables and surprise dessert. The filet mignon was so good! Tender, great flavours and a very large portion! Love love loved it. I've had filet mignon at Jacobs & Co and David Duncan house before and I was still impressed with this. Salad was ok, it was interesting to eat this in the dark. Dessert turned out to be chocolate cheesecake. It was rich but nothing extraordinary. Still I think everyone should try this at least once. And the steak alone is enough to win a return visit in my book!"}
{"text":"First...  THE FOOD:  Pre-fixe pay structure:  $32 for 2 courses (main + app, or main + dessert) or  $39 for 3 courses (app + main + dessert)  -add a $6.50 glass of merlot (only option by the glass) and the total, including tax and tip = $50  i had the main+app combo.  for the app, i chose the grilled portobello mushroom with balsamic and shaved parmesan (quite passable) and for the the main, veal described as lightly battered with a lemon glaze, vegetables and roasted potatoes. everything about this entree reminded me of the 'special holiday meal' a workplace cafeteria might offer employees, come christmas or thanksgiving -- except that I'm confident that a cafeteria version would've been better. the veal had been pounded into oblivion so as to be paper-thin, yet was still rawhide-like in texture, completely void of  taste, including any hint of lemon flavouring. the vegetables and potatoes were...string beans and... potatoes, doused with oil and salt (and the potatoes accompanied w/  -- I'd guess -- a  'clubhouse'-type chicken gravy)  THE EATING-IN-DARKNESS EXPERIENCE:  the initial cheaps laughs that came from being in absolute darkness (e.g. trying to connect glasses for 'cheers-ing', constant din of glassware breaking, using ones hands to locate and paw food off the plate after giving up on the fork-stabbing) wore off pretty quickly.  And, sure, it gives pause as to how it would feel to be visually impaired/blind but, of course, only in a fleeting way (having the comfort of knowing sight will be yours again very soon).   Soon enough, my thoughts turned to a) the racket they've got goin' on, since they've a captive audience (no other place offering this experience in TO) and considering the price and how sub-par the quality and quantity is (not to mention the money saved on décor and electricity), this joint's a goldmine b) wishing someone would open up a place with the exact same concept but with decent food -- a little competition would have 'o noir' down and out within 2 weeks.  and that would make me happy -- partly because the food on offer is  COMPLETELY incidental to the gimmick of eating in pitch-darkness but, mostly, because it's insulting to diners everywhere to serve cafeteria-grade slop but merchandise it under the philosophy of 'thoughtful/exotic dishes created to challenge your palate as you use your remaining 4 senses to distinguish flavours perhaps otherwise unappreciated.'  Eesh.  BOTTOM LINE: save the (minimum) $50/pp this'll cost you for patronage at establishments that actually attempt to deliver what they're trying to sell(!)"}
{"text":"Went to O Noir for the novelty effect of eating in the dark.  It's a very non-descript location off Church and I probably walked by it quite a few times not knowing it was there.  You have to walk down stairs to get in as the whole restaurant is underground.  Food - Pretty average overall.  You get to choose a starter and a main with the option to add a desert for an additional price.  Drink selection is pretty generic too.  Grilled Portobello Mushroom on Green Salad - was decent starter dish.  Filet Mignon with Potatoes and Veggies - the filet was of decent quality and was cooked to a good medium rare tenderness.  It had a bit of peppery sauce to it that added some nice flavour.  Fruit Sorbet - pretty standard stuff.  Service - The server was friendly and fairly responsive although you can't really flag them down since you are in darkness!   Environment - Definitely quite the novelty aspect of eating in the dark.  You will probably spill some food on your lap and probably won't get all of the food off your plate either.  It is pitch black and felt like there was about 15-20 people in the room.  The acoustics are very good so you can definitely have a conversation with your dinner date... but unfortunately you can also hear everyone else and their conversations too!  It was something I wanted to try out and now that I have... probably won't repeat.  Probably worth trying once for novelty or if entertaining out of town guests.  Sorry no pics of food this time lol"}
{"text":"SPOILER ALERT - I will be revealing what the Surprise dishes were...  I got there at 8pm for the 8:15pm seating.  I later noticed that people who got there after us, were asked what they wanted from the menu and then were seating before us.  So it seemed to be random on how they brought people into the dark rooms. Strike 1.  When they came around to us, my date and I both ordered the Surprise for each of the 3 courses because I heard that's part of the fun, guessing what you're eating.  When they called for us they brought us to wait outside one door.  About 10 min later, after seating several others before us they then tell us to go to another door for another room. Strike 2.  They seemed extremely disorganized as the way they were seating people at each table in the rooms seemed to be some odd system of writing things down on scrap pieces of paper.  Took a quick glance at my cell and it was 8:40pm already.  We were finally seated and probably waited for may be 15 min before being offered bread when others around us were being offered it. Strike 3!!!   I stopped counting from here.  We then waited for maybe another 20 min (no cell or watches allowed to be used in the dark rooms) before the server brings us dishes and says \"mushroom appetizers?\"  We said, no we ordered the surprises.  Another 30 min passes while everyone else is eating it seems.  Server comes and says \"can I clear your dishes?\"  We're like \"what dishes?  we didn't even get our food yet.\"    He puts in another order, and he brings 1 plate out just for me saying my date's is coming soon.  Not wanting to pass the dish through darkness, I started to eat and was disappointed to find that it was just a normal salad.  When my date's dish came it was also a salad but seemed to have some sort of warm sauce on it.  I would say the kitchen was likely disorganized as well since they seemed to forget our appetizer and before the entrees, the server came around and asked several tables including ours, what we each ordered.  Entree came fairly quickly (compared to the apps at least) and was much more fun.  Had 3 different meats which we had to guess on a pile of couscous.  The couscous was way over done though.  Dessert was just a simple cheesecake which tasted store bought.  When we went to pay I turned on my cell and it was 10:48pm.  Overall, the food was not that great and apparently the MASSIVE gratuity is included in the price.  Fun experience?  If you like sitting in the dark, waiting lengthy periods for your food, unable to flag the server down properly to tell him you're waiting a long time, then sure, it's fun.  Oh yes, and the entire time there was this weird smell in the room the entire time.  No idea what it was but it wasn't all the appetizing.    Would I return?  No."}
{"text":"We went to O.Noir for my wife's birthday last night. I'm not going to lie .... It was a little unnerving at first. My eyes were playing tricks on me.   After about 10 mins it turned into a really unforgettable experience. Our server Tracey was Amazing!! Our food was absolutely Delicious!! The entire restaurant sang Happy Birthday to my wife.   I recommend this to Everyone!!! Great Time!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Onoir last night. I had the arugula salad, and filet mignon as the main. The food was honestly prepared by a lazy chef. No flavour, and just lazy preparation. The salad had no taste to the dressing, and whoever prepared it, though that shards of parmigiano would cover it. Not at all. The steak was ok, but vegetables were just cooked in butter/oil. It honestly wasn't great.   The whole dark concept is fun, but honestly the food is horrendous. This was my 2nd time, and this time I went because a friend wanted to go for his birthday. The first time I went was a disappointment, but it was over a year ago, and i honestly had hoped it would have improved.  Also, yes, i know you're eating in the dark, but you quickly notice you are using cheap tablewear, sitting on fold out tables or crappy tables, and old banquet chairs. I know you're not supposed to care, but i do.   The mere fact that they continue to receive poor reviews, and their owner is aware of this, and yet they still haven't improved the food fascinates me."}
{"text":"Dining at 'O'Noir Toronto' was a surreal experience.  I first saw this concept on Hell's Kitchen and was excited to see we have  a place like this in Toronto!  The way it works is you can check your coat in for free (tips appreciated but not required), and then sit in a small lounge (with a bar) where you're given menus.  A waitress/waiter will come take your order and then take you to a door where a visually impaired waiter will take you into a dark (pitch-black) dining room to your table.   You hold on to him and your friends will all hold on to each other and walk to the table.    You're waited on as per usual, and anytime you need him, you call out to him and he'll come (he's nearby).  And yes, there are other people around at their own tables.  It seems there were about three separate dining areas though, rather than one big one.  When we got back to the lounge to pay after, some people came out of another door saying their area was quiet, while we complained about a large flamboyant group in our dining area.  It is not scary.  Personally, I was very comfortable.    The food was average.   There wasn't a huge selection.  The calamari appetizer is NOT recommended.  I had the chicken breast with scalloped potatoes, beans and grilled eggplant.  The chicken breast was moist.  Chocolate cake dessert was good.    It's a good one time experience, and enhanced if you're trying to be romantic. Price range $32-$40.00, plus drinks.  FYI - It's under an apartment building in a quiet residential area of downtown.  Street parking is free after 9pm so that was great.  I was able to park right infront the restaurant    I would recommend this for an adventurous novelty night out."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this restaurant.  It was an incredible experience to eat an entire meal in complete darkness.  Really highlighted how visual my world is.... from seeing where my food is on the plate to the visual cues I use from facial expressions of my dinner companions.  Unfortunately the taste experience of the meal had a lot to be desired.  I chose a three course meal of which each dish would be a surprise.  All I knew was that I would have a seafood appetizer, a meat main and a dessert.  The appetizer was calamari in French salad dressing with a few pieces of spinach.  Not a flavour combination that was very appealing.  There was way too much dressing.  The main was better.... tender and moist prime rib served with green beans and mashed potatoes.  The meat was flavourful.  The veggies ok.  Dessert as a very plain cheesecake.  Edible nothing more.  While I understand the practical realities of plastic glassware... drinking out of a plastic tumbler took away from the sensory experience of the meal.    Our server was lovely with an upbeat, friendly style.  He handled the unique scenario of serving us in complete darkness very smoothly.  Overall a fun night to try something so different.   Would likely not go again due to the food."}
{"text":"I had so much fun here!!!! I felt a bit of anxiety at first, but after about 5-10 minutes or so when my body realized my eyes couldn't adjust to the room, it was much better.   I ordered the pasta, which was pretty good considering it's plain Jane pasta with tomato sauce and vegetables. My friend ordered the filet mignon and said it was cooked perfectly and delicious.   Our waiter was great and didn't sneak up on us or anything. He explained where everything is and was very pleasant.   Overall, the experience in itself is worth the 5 stars. I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time. At one point, everyone in the entire room was laughing. I really recommend trying it at least once."}
{"text":"This place Is definitely worth experiencing! Ever heard of the term \"once in a life time experience\"? well this is it! The service here was great, it was different from the usual places that you would ever go to eat at. I was not sure what to expect. we ended up following a blind waiter into a pitch black room with other people. I sat across from my girl friend trying to figure out the layout of the room. the food here wasnt amazing or anything but the experience of it was alot of fun. i would recommend this place for people to try. and also recommend this place as a first date if they know the girl is SPONTANEOUS and fun :D"}
{"text":"Ordered roasted red pepper to start. Tasted amazing. Cheese was so delicious.  Mains ordered were steak and pesto chicken.  Everything was wonderful except the potatoes. They were just average.  Dessert was chocolate cake with ice cream. It was super tasty.   Experience was interesting. Prepare to use your fingers. Tracey was our server and she was absolutely delightful and walked us through the whole meal. \"Drink on the left\" ect.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place. Very original. It is very interesting to dine in a place without any light to help you see. Pitch blackness was fun and definitely out of your comfort level. The food was good.  Your other senses will take over!  Have a couple of drinks before entering, it will a lot more fun."}
{"text":"We went  to Onoir for my birthday last year, it was a very cool and interesting experience . The main issue with this place is the food and the price , our salads had salt on them and well basically everything else we had was crap.  I wouldn't go back and I would encourage others not to go but to rather make dinner themselves and eat it in the dark at home."}
{"text":"Hey guys its me again - your food connoisseur from the hood. A lot of you guys might be wondering how the heck is a kid from the hood eating at all these places, well it's simple I have a job - and no I'm not you neighbourhood drug dealer. I'm your average person. Anyways enough of my rap-sheet I mean background lets get on to this review...  So I came here a couple weeks ago with a couple of friends. Got this groupon which was a good price for a three course meal. I'm always looking for a deal so I had to buy it.  Walked in and it looked shady it was like I was going to Dracula's house but I guess that's the ambience they're going for. I didn't mind it I had a couple stains on my shirt that day so it worked out perfectly.  Walked into the dark room and it was a little cold but I guess it's to keep you from falling asleep cause it's pitch dark in there. We had a set menu and they gave us an app main and dessert.  I forgot what I had for the app but for the main I had salmon and rice which was ok not dry but nothing to die over and had ice cream (prob chapmans) as a dessert. That's as much as I'm going to talk about the food cause it's not really for the food its more for the experience.   I found it overall to be pretty cool, but when you really think about it it's just a dark room where you eat, and then I thought to myself I do this often.   This is one of those places where you'll go once and prob won't ever go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made reservations for Valentine's Day, for a 7:30 service (we were given the option between a 5:30 and 7:30 dinner service).  After driving by twice (the sign is quite small), we finally parked in the underground parking of the hotel in which the restaurant is located.  Parking is about $5.00.   Food wise, it's quite pricey, and I say that only because the overall flavor was meh. I wouldn't give the food more than a 3. We chose the surprise starter and surprise main course for $32, as well as a surprise main course and surprise dessert for $32.  The biggest surprise was that every meal was actually an already existing item on the menu. We thought that by going with the surprise option we would have no clue as to what we were eating but with the first bite we knew exactly what it was since we had skimmed through it before settling.   We ended up with , Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Parmigiano and Balsamic Vinegar on a Mixed Green Salad, Five Spice O.Noir Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables , Chicken Breast with Potatoes, Vegetables, and Tomato Sauce, and vanilla ice cream with apple pie.  The flavors were very basic and not as enticing as they sound from their description. Our server was Elias who was really nice, however, i took 20 minutes to bring us waters and he never once explained what it was we were eating after taking away our dishes. Also, my boyfrien went to the bathroom at which point our dessert (ice crema) was brought out. Bad timing to bring out a melting dish!   The experience was hilarious and we had a great time trying to find each other's mouth in the dark. Experience-5!"}
{"text":"I gave three stars merely for the actual experience. The food was only so-so. Dining in the dark was really cool, however.  The waiters are all blind, and they know their way around the place very well. It is amazing to see them do it. That being said there were a few times where we were waiting around for a next course or a new drink or something like that. I believe the server forgot about us. We were very entertained with the whole idea of dining in the dark, so it didn't matter as much as it would've at a regular restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought i scored a deal by paying $30 for a 3 course menu for 2, turned out not so. The concept is cool, execution not so.   The dinning area was tiny, with at least 9 tables in a small area. It was NOISY, all the conversations overlapped and every guest needed to raise their voices so that their partner can hear.  Service was fast for starter and dessert, but the entree was SLOW, we are fast eaters and it took us 90 mins between entering and exiting the dinning area.  The portion of food was TINY, I ordered 3 surprises (green salad, 4 tiny pieces of duck and caramel cheesecake) and my friend ordered grill peppers, 4 pieces of chicken breast and surprise desert (caramel cheesecake). It tasted ok, but we left HUNGRY.  Even with the deal, i find it EXPENSIVE, with the \"included\" 18% tip on the base price. The total for us was $30 + ~$25 = ~$55. Even if i can score this deal again, I wouldnt go again, let alone pay the regular price. Insane..."}
{"text":"What can I say.  Dinner in the dark is a whole different experience. The fillet Minion with potatoes and green beans was absolutely fantastic and  the surprise dessert (which isn't on the menu) was far from a disappointment. I highly recommend ordering it on your visit.  As for the service. It was  amazing. Our waiter Dave was spectacular. The whole concept about this place is phenomenal. Except, having a quiet dinner in this place, is almost impossible sometimes, but I can understand how people would get excited over having dinner in complete darkness."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. I did panic a bit for the first few minutes in the dark but relaxed shortly after. I ordered the surprise entree which allowed the kitchen to send their choice meal to our able. My spouse chose the surprise dessert. I received a delicious steak, mashed potatoes and asparagus for the surprise and wife received a New York style cheesecake for hers. The server was blind, friendly though had a slight odour of b.o. All overlooked as we were empathetic. Who would complain???"}
{"text":"This is very different place.  You go there and experience the darkness.  Food is okay, portion is pretty small, I think this maybe because it will be easier for people eating without seeing the food.   A place I probably won't go second time, unless a group of people are going together.   But if you haven't gone to, definitely need to find out."}
{"text":"This was quite an experience. The place is pitch dark (ie: your eyes never adapt) and one must rely on other senses for the duration of the time spent there.   The food was delicious. My friends and I all ordered something different and even passed spoons/forks around to experience all the different flavours and smells.   This is not just a sensory experience. It is a humbling oppourtunity to experience what it is to be completely blind and to put ones trust in other fellow humans.   The servers are all blind. The man who helped us (Victor) was very helpful, and I will always be grateful for his contribution in this life lesson.   Cautionary - Please take your time and chew your food carefully!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't exceptional but not bad enough for me to complain about it. The experience definitely made it worth the while. The service exceeded my expectations as well. This isn't a place I'd go on a regular basis not because of the price (I just prefer seeing my food and look at people's eyes when I speak haha), but a place I'd take friends visiting the city for sure!"}
{"text":"I seem to have had a pretty standard experience at O Noir - similar to what others have mentioned. Great concept, good fun, decent food, sadly expensive.  It's difficult to emphasise enough just how DARK the dining room is. It's not the darkness you get when you turn off your bedroom light, or the darkness of a nightclub...it's total, complete pitch black. I've never experienced anything like it, and no - your eyes will not adjust.  It was very disconcerting being led into the room - quite creepy, in fact! I'd recommend this restaurant for people looking for a good laugh, and it helps if the people at tables around you are also up for some fun and giggles. We were seated next to a hysterical couple who found the whole experience very funny, which in turn made our experience much better, too!  The food was good, but I definitely would be unhappy paying the same price for the same food in a 'normal' restaurant. The peppers served with my (delicious) goats cheese were soggy, and there was a distinctly salty flavour to my (otherwise delicious) steak and accompanying vegetables.  Our visually-impaired server, Dianna, was hilarious and very efficient. The friendliness of the front-of-house staff however left much to be desired.  I'd come back, but only if I was showing tourists around, or if it was part of a larger group who had never been before, and were up for a fun start to a big night out."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  This restaurant offers a very unique ambiance and creates a truly unique experience. Personally, it really slows me down and gets me to truly appreciate and experience all of the different tastes, smells and textures of my food. I always order the surprise dish and dessert just to add to the mystery :)"}
{"text":"After reading online reviews the four of us didn't have high expectations for the food but went anyway for the experience.... The food was delicious, our server (Chelsea) was kind and had a great sense of humour, and the experience was awesome. Highly recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Everybody should try it once, but maybe just once. Very fun experience, the place is pitch black. So black that after a while, your mind starts playing tricks on you and you start seeing some tiny lights on the ceiling. The servers were nice and attentive, and, as I said, the experience is very fun, I'm happy I've tried it. Now that being said, I don't think I'd repeat just for the food, it was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The experience really pushed this rating up to a 4 for me. The food was delicious, but nothing inspired or out of the ordinary. It was delicious, classic and well-prepared.   As others have said, you go for the experience. Eating in complete darkness was a great way to appreciate the everyday life of those without sight, but to also connect with the food itself. Often times, what's presented on the plate shapes a diner's perception before they take the first bite. Eating in darkness really lets the ingredients speak for themselves.   While the food wasn't particularly memorable, that doesn't mean it wasn't good. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Had dinner this past Saturday with my family of 5. What an awesome experience! Our eyes never adjusted to the darkness. I personally enjoyed not being able to see while my younger sister was a little uncomfortable. But you know (at least you should know) what you are getting into! It's funny what a difference in EVERYTHING dining in the dark makes.   Food: For an appetizer I had the grilled calamari over mixed green salad. Absolutely delicious! The calamari was awesome. As a main course I had the steak which came with green beans and potatoes. Honestly, one of the best steaks I've had in a while.   Service was also great. Would highly recommend this to anyone to try at least once. Was very fun with a small group. An unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"Put yourself in some else's shoes. That's literally the main reason we all try this restaurant. The pricing for the food is fair and even comparable to other restaurants. For a starter, main and dessert, it comes to just under $40 before tax.   The ambiance was great, they dim the lights before you go in to help your eyes adjust. It is underground which is not really ideal, if you are actually blind.. Because the steps down to the entrance, then the multiple doors inside...  The food, I had the octopus for the appetiser, which quite honestly  didn't have the same texture as octopus I usually eat... So it was worrisome.. But the main (surprise meal) and dessert (surprise, again) were great.  Overall experience was good. I would recommend this place for a first date... The darkness (and the fact they make you turn OFF your cell phone) helps you focus more on conversation and the actual company of the person."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and we had so much fun in the PITCH black..couldn't see a thing. Its a cool experience to eat in the dark. The food was good but the experience was more memorable."}
{"text":"An incredible experience! The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"IT WAS TOO LOUD!  And neither the food, nor the service, nor the experience made up for the noise in any way. Beginning with our server, who spoke at an elevated volume, to the lack of sound baffling in the room, to the loud music (rock n' roll) playing, to the large groups trying to be heard over the noise in the room, I couldn't hear my dinner companions who were sitting right next to me.  Much less enjoy the food or the special surroundings. The Montreal O.Noir was a far better experience - quiet servers, live harp music, better wine list.  Food so-so. Leave this to the giggly tourists - no, on second thought, everyone deserves better than this.  Especially at these prices!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was good. Our waiter was amazing. It was a group of 15 people and we all had a wonderful time. Great experience, would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your money. They forgot to serve us our entrée, and rushed us to eat it before the main course. The salad had too much dressing on it. The main course was small in portion size: potatoes bland, steak size was about 3oz with some green beans drenched in butter. Dont expect to get out under 90$ for 2 people (with a nice 18% gratuity tagged on)"}
{"text":"I had heard about these restaurants a few years ago from QI and i am always looking for new experiences. So this year for my birthday i decided to see if there was one around, luck would have it there was. So i made the reservation and waited impatiently for two weeks.   The day before one of my dogs had been acting a bit weird but. Nothing to be concerned about.  The morning of the reservation though i woke up to her crying out in agony. I took her to the vet with her sitting on my lap the whole car ride in pain. Turns out she had sprained her neck somehow.  To keep a long story short my parents sacrificed there place to look after my dogs.   I immediately contacted the restaurant. It's was about ten o'clock in the morning and definitely the earliest i could have contacted them about the incident. Instead of a person answering that i could discuss the situation with, i was welcomed by the lifeless sound of a recording. I left my message telling them my name, about the emergency and my telephone number. But i never did receive a call back. Because of there seemingly weird 'no show' policy i sat there worried as i drove to my sisters place who knew nothing of this...or so i thought. So when i got there we did not waist any time discussing it. We came to the same conclusion i already had, and would have liked to discuss with someone at the restaurant that never called back, to cancel my birthday and attempt to get everyone together again. So it was now 3 in the afternoon, 3 1/2 hours away from the reservations, we sent them a follow up email telling as much.   Still not receiving any kind of communication we went out and tried to salvage my birthday as best we could, then went about our normal lives and thought nothing more of the incident...until almost a week later someone at the restaurant finally deemed it worthy to take a few measely steps and contact me to say that they considered my situation and are ONLY going to charge me one persons 'no show' fee of 25$.  So in conclusion i would stay away from any place that has reservations and does not have or clearly marks an emergency situation clause...i know i will.  Oh....and since a transaction has been made i feel it is well within my rights to write a review based on it."}
{"text":"I was taken here as a treat for my birthday by my boyfriend. Let me start off by saying this place is a trip in itself. Going to the bathroom even gave me a scare. Entering the restaurant, we were greeted by staff and were given a menu where they then told us that we have to order dessert. um....okay. The menu doesn't even have prices which I thought was ridiculous. A legally blind lady then led us into the dinner area and we all had to hold each others shoulders as if we were doing the Cha Cha. I knew this restaurant was dark but I didn't think it would be pitch dark. I mean I couldn't even see the whites of my boyfriend's eyes. The waitress then gave us our complimentary bread which was delicious!!! It took a little while for us to receive our dinner but I would imagine that that was because it was super dark in there. I ordered the grilled shrimp with a tomato risotto and grilled string beans. My boyfriend order the tomato chicken breast with grilled veggies. We LOVED our dish! I don't know if it was the fact that it was super dark in there that made our taste buds happier, but that dish exceeded the heck out of my expectations. I made no use for the fork and made use of my hands because you literally feel handicapped in this environment. For dessert we talked the waitress into letting us share one because I was stuffed! We shared a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. It was nice but nothing you can't buy in a box from No Frills. All in all I would recommend this place as a one time try but I couldn't imagine anyone going there twice. Every second I could feel the presence of someone behind me so I would constantly swing my arm. Dinner should be relaxing but this restaurant made my inner paranoia come out. Leaving the dark dinner area to go back into the main area was blinding because your eyes have to make the transition. Our bill turned out to be $80 excluding tips. Pretty steep considering the portion of my dinner was very small."}
{"text":"Went: 8:15 pm Sat Apr 18 2015 Ordered: do not recall Cost: incl. tax and tip $80 Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies. You go here more for the experience than the food. I felt a lot of anxiety after first entering. I prayed my stress level would lower or I would freak out. Luckily, I did calm down. My date and I ordered different dishes and shared. The food was average and not that memorable.   Bottom line: If you are one that likes unique experiences and do not mind paying a little more for that experience, then you might enjoy dining here. It is a different but I would not do it again. The food is average and the restaurant is expensive for what you get. 3.5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Experience was cool if you enjoy not seeing anything! Food was alright, I expected my taste would be heightened since I couldn't see anything however the food wasn't that great and you're put in a large room with others so it gets quite loud but it's nice since it creates jobs for the legally blind"}
{"text":"Great experience and good food. Just don't order the chocolate cake as things can get messy."}
{"text":"3 girlfriends and i went here one night a few months ago and i still tell people about my experience with \"dining in the dark\". we were all excited after reading about O.Noir and what would seem to be an interesting dining experience. It's a great concept - incorporating sense depravation into dining as an experiment to see if the other senses (taste, sound, etc) would be amplified. I also found it interesting that the servers were all legally blind and offered to explain their day-to-day situation with us.   The restaurant decor is horrible. The waiting room is dimly lit (for a good reason) and it looks like your grandmothers house. Furnished from what seems like 19th century furniture and a fake bookcase (come one, at least have reading material for the wait!). You pre-order your food and drinks and then wait for the servers to take you in.  You enter in a line with one hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you. it's PITCH black and you can't see a thing, but what you hear is incredibly loud dinner guests screaming, laughing and talking. I suppose everyone is seated relatively  close to one another (more on this later) because you can hear everyones conversation and even chewing if you really pay attention. Once you're inside, you will have a hard time getting the attention of the waiter if you wish to use the restroom or get a sense of anxiety and want to step outside. You literally have to SCREAM your waiters name which adds to the already obnoxious atmosphere.   sure it's fun for the first 5 minutes. you're sitting in the dark, you don't know where your water is, whose leg is touching yours and how the hell you are going to eat. but this gets boring fast. you end up waiting a long time for your food & drink and it's less then fabulous. i had ordered the surprise me options for both my courses and drink (they would choose the meal for me and i'd have to guess what i was eating). the drink itself was pretty gross, some watered down mix of rum and orange creamsicle tasting liqueur. my appetizer came and it had turned out to be the calamari. it was squishy and overcooked, nothing special. this took me a very long to eat for i had to feel around on my plate with my fingers. it was rather disgusting, i felt like i was a toddler learning to eat. my main course was a badly done steak that was cut up into pieces and potatoes which tasted stale. definitely not impressed, i could have made a better meal at home. my dessert was chocolate cake that was so thick and sweet i couldn't finish it. it was a chocolate overdose, even my friend who is a self proclaimed chocolate addict decided it was an overload.   while we were \"enjoying\" our food, the people beside us had gotten drunk and spilled water on their table which magically happened to seep into ours (hence the close seating) and then proceeded to order martinis to get furthermore plastered. they really should monitor how much people drink in this place because it's a hazard. the one girl ended up knocking over her martini glass and it shattered on the floor. we didn't know where the broken glass was and the server didn't seem to care for no one bothered to clean it up or ask if we or the people next to us were okay.   when we left the darkness it was a shock to be exposed to the dim light. thank god they opted for that instead of tacky light because my eyes hurt for approximately 10 minutes afterwards. i ended up paying $50 for my food and drink (1) which was a HUGE waste of money for the quality of food i had eaten. i suppose i paid for the experience (ha ha). i don't even want to think of what the place looks like with the lights on, they probably have cheap plastic chairs from the 80s and old tables that fit with the rest of the decor.  as we left we were all disappointed, our excitement had long faded, as did our anxiety but hey at least we get to say we tried it. we also joked about blind dates at o.noir, wouldn't that be fun? i don't recommend it!"}
{"text":"O Noir is a \"dine in the dark\" restaurant experience that has just opened its doors to Torontonians after serving Montreal for over 3 years.  The concept is very simple - dinner in a pitch black dining room where you remove sight from your sense with the hopes of enhancing your ability to taste.   Quick note - you arrive at the restaurant by traversing a maze of doors in staircases at the Town Inn Suites.  This, although frustrating at first, helps give the restaurant a real, underground, gritty feeling which serves the overall ambience well.     Pricing is fairly reasonable at $39 for a three course or $32 for a two course.  I highly recommend the surprise dishes since I felt it enhanced the experience by truly making you embrace using your smell and touch in attempts to figure out what it is you are actually eating.  And it's not all about the experience - the food is actually good!  Overall, a great, highly recommended, dining experience that I believe everyone should try at least once."}
{"text":"Was definitely an experience! From being lead into a dark room by your waiter, to managing to eat food without being able to see. The food we ordered was all very tasty. And we had a great deal with a three course dinner for two found on groupon. The price is appropriate to what you receive and the service was great. Would recommend for people to try it for themselves!"}
{"text":"The food at O Noir is very basic and ordinary, but what really amplifies this place is the novelty and experience of eating in total darkness. We were extremely impressed with our waiter who was on point, charismatic and charming.   If you're looking for something different to do in the city on a Saturday night - do this."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant a week ago and had to try it ASAP. It was awesome! At first, I felt disoriented but it was amazing how after a few minutes you get used to the darkness. It was so much fun and definitely one of the most unique experiences I have ever had. Our server, Dave, was really nice, efficient and made the overall experience very positive."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to come here and I was a bit nervous since I never ate in the dark before.    We had to walk downstairs and there is a hall way before checking in with the hostess.  Then we are at the bar where we place our order.   The restaurant is pretty dim and I didn't really know why but that's makes sense because after eating in the dark for an hour, your eyes are not adjusted so the bright light would be painful.  The food was pretty good.  I felt pretty adjusted to the atmosphere and it was fun.   I also sat next to the wall so that helped.  Like others have said, you don't really come here for the food and the portions. I did like my food though. I had the octopus salad, filet mignon and chocolate mousse.  The filet mignon was precut so that helped.  The chocolate mousse was a bit too sweet though.  I don't know if I would come back though but the experience was good and the food was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Last evening, I attended O'Noir Toronto, (my 4th or 5th visit). I was with my girlfriend, (2nd visit), and her daughter, (1st visit). We were seated, our servers were Gavin and Taylor. About 10 minutes after we were seated a large group (approx 12), of 20 somethings, (from their voices etc), were being led in. The server had to stop part way to their tables to tell them to settle down, as they were being so loud, they couldn't hear his directions.   They finally got seated and were being very loud, beginning to ruin our experience. One of the males kept pulling out his cell phone. He was warned twice, the \"lady\" seated with him, said he was deaf and didn't understand. The server said someone either needed to convey that he couldn't use his phone or take it away, as it was ruining everyone else in the room evening.   Obviously, this person didn't get the message and pulled out his phone yet again. at that point the server, (I believe it was Taylor). Told the group that they had been warned and that they would have to leave. Miraculously, the \"deaf\" person said \"ok ok it is away, I NOW know your serious\".  It made no difference, the server stood his ground and advised the group to get up and he would lead them out of the room. Most of them did so. The now \"cured\" deaf person, took out his phone and used the screen light so he and his \"lady\" friend could make their own way out, (which still took a few minutes as he couldn't even with the light find the door!!  SHAME on this \"lady\" trying to use the excuse that he had a disability, in an establishment that employs people who are sight impaired! That is a REAL class act there.   The servers were VERY apologetic for the remainder of our stay, despite us telling them it was NOT their fault and that they handled it with TRUE PROFESSIONALISM. Kudos to Taylor and Gavin for standing their ground and ensuring the remaining guests had a great experience!!   As usual, the food was fantastic. I had all three \"surprise \" courses. My GF, had the Fillet, which while ordered Medium was a little scorched on the outside. The girl had Vegetarian stir fry, (she needed a to go container as she couldn't finish it all, the server said that is their second largest dish, with the pasta being the largest)..lol  We WILL be back, again."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! I was a bit skeptical because it is in the dark. However, I had a great time! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Experience was great .. but I wasn't happy with the serving size comparing to the cost. As you walk into dinning room you can feel how cheap the furniture was. I would extend my arms and could feel other table around me. At the end when we were to pay our bill they force you to pay 18% tip if you insist on paying less than 18% the woman at reception gave the look and asked \"was there something wrong with the service ?\" I hated the fact she acted like everyone have to give tip that she wants or else you get the looks from her. Definitely won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am only giving O Noir a 4 based on the food (which I would rate a 3), however, I do think that it's an experience that everyone should try! (If you don't know yet, it's pitch black!)  It may seem dark when you walk in- you'll find out why soon! You order drinks outside in the \"lobby\" area, and the waiters bring you into a a pitch black room.  My eyes didn't calm down the whole time I was there, I saw flashes of light and weird optical illusions. It's unbelievably weird not to see anything. I almost panicked at one point, but didn't. You hear more than you normally would- some tables would start to get loud and you'd find that you'd be matching their volume.  The waiters were great. I loved the \"intro\" they did, where they showed you where to find everything and touch to the right and left of your plate, etc. It was very helpful and reassuring for later.    The food was mediocre. I had an appetizer and main, and some members of my party had a main and dessert. There was nothing wrong with the food, but it was relatively bland. You don't go for the food. The experience is worth it. If I ate the food for that price anywhere else, I would be very disappointed, however, do it once, with a group, for the sake of going.   (When you come out, the \"dark\" room is so bright  that it hurts your eyes! (You need to get adjusted before you can exit the restaurant!)  Really awesome waiters, though.   And make reservations!"}
{"text":"The food good, the service was great. Definitely worth experiencing"}
{"text":"Great feeling when you walk in and the décor in the lit area (where you order) was beautiful. Really made it feel like a whole new place you've never been before and going into a whole new experience. The one disappointment is the fact that there was no brail to feel anywhere. I at least expected some brail writing that people could have touched and tried reading while looking at the brail alphabet they have displayed.   I had the filet mignon and it was pre-cut which was good since it would have been hard to but everything in the dark. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't the greatest. It was decent and acceptable for the groupon price that we paid.   Our server was very nice and helped us whenever we needed help. Definitely a great experience and I would definitely come back and encourage others to try O.Noir as well!"}
{"text":"I think the reviews here are pretty spot on:  a really interesting experience, kind/helpful waitstaff ... But the food is pretty basic (and not worth the price), and the ordering process felt very rushed the hostess completely unwelcoming.  I ordered the penne as a main, which I found to be OK but slightly overcooked, and paired with what seemed like frozen veggies.  Then a chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert that I found pretty tasty.   The experience was a cool and confronting one - well worth trying once.  The room is COMPLETELY dark and you quickly get a feel (no pun intended) of what life is like for the visually impaired.  Found it challenging at first but adapted pretty quickly.  Can see how others didn't enjoy the challenge of eating in the dark...but that shouldn't be a surprise as it is very clear what one is signing up for.    Waitstaff were great.  Hostess less so: scolded us for being a bit late and rushed us to order but we then had to chase her down to place the order and get ourselves seated.  Then we waited 30 minutes for our entree.  A bit odd for a place so focused on punctuality.      If you come looking for the experience, you'll be impressed.  If in search of stand out food, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food, AMAZING (best mashed potatoes I've had in my entire life and I grew up in an Irish farmhouse), our server Rhonda, was the best part of the experience, SO friendly, funny, sweet and thoughtful, she really made this experience fun and special. I was nervous going into this, but adjusted quickly once in the room and from there, it was so fun and an amazing experience that I'm happy I tried! Only disappointment, is that when we got in, the person acting as the hostess I guess, was wearing a blue jumper, I think possibly was the manager or owner, had a TERRIBLE attitude at the beginning, seemed REALLY rude and off putting, it started our experience as a terrible one and we thought \"oh no, maybe this was a mistake\". Rhonda fixed that, and then when we went to pay, this person was then SO friendly and fun, it was very confusing and almost caused us to leave."}
{"text":"It was a good experience sitting in the dark while searching for my dinner on my plate.  The service was friendly and the food was good but the portions were tiny."}
{"text":"Went to O Noir for the first time, and most likely the last. All the servers are blind, our server, Dave was a delight, very nice and attentive. As you go into the room, you are told to hold onto the waiters shoulder so he can seat you as the room is very dark. The waiter told us where our plates and cutlery is.   My girlfriend ordered the mushroom salad for appetizer and I the roasted peppers with goat cheese. The roasted peppers were bland and had no seasoning on it. The salad was better. For our main my girlfriend ordered the fillet minion and vegetables and I ordered the shrimp risotto and vegetables. The shrimp and steak were good and seasoned. The vegetables you can clearly tell that they had used frozen mixed vegetables. The centre of our vegetables were still frozen!!! For $33 per person, you would expect fresh food.   Trying to eat with a fork proved to be a difficult task, the experience made me empathize more for people without vision."}
{"text":"Great experience.  More of an a sensory experience rather than focusing on the food. Had a great time."}
{"text":"The food here was okay, but the portions was a good size. However, you don't go in here for really either of them.   The trip to O.Noir is purely for the experience. As soon as you enter, you are greeted, given the menus to decide what you would like to have (2 course or 3 course). Once decided, you are then taken into a very very dark room, literally removing one of the sense you rely upon so much - Sight.  From then on, you are really on a ride to enjoy your other senses, really get to feel/taste/smell your food, be able to differentiate between ingredients based on the 'bite' or the 'taste'. You really start appreciating how your senses are enhanced and also appreciate and respect the folks who are visually impaired.  I would highly recommend for the experience and enjoy the trip there - make sure to have a reservation a bit in Advance (almost 3 days before on average) as it is a popular place and a one of a kind location"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars- for so many reasons.  First, let's discuss the non- food related bonus this restaurant gives. This place employs a blind staff to be the servers - a community with a staggering unemployment rate. This provides an opportunity to employ an underemployed segment of the population as well as let seeing people interact with a portion of the community they don't usually get to meet - it's a wonderful bringing together of people, and letting seeing people rely on the strengths of the blind.   The concept from a dining perspectives is incredible. Eating in the dark allows your other senses to be highlighted and you judge the food on taste alone, and nothing egts in the way of that. When you allow yourself the opportunity to rely on your reflexes and instincts, you will be amazed at how capable you are of eating in the pitch blackjack.  I opted to be surprised, and it is such a delightful experience to have to guess what your food is! It's truly unique and nothing you can experience anywhere else.  Last, I had made a reservation for my birthday last year for a large party of 8- and mistakenly made it for Montreal!! I used OoenTable and Toronto is not on that app  - a stupid mistake that I felt terrible about. They were gracious enough to accommodate the large party and seat us, even though it was my fault and we were a large group. I can't thank them enough.  Dining is done in 2 segments since this does take time and coordination in the small dining room and reservations are required. RUN don't walk, to this truly unique add eye opening experience."}
{"text":"This was definitely an experience and I would recommend everyone to try dining in the dark at least once in their life, unless you're extremely terrified of the dark and closterfobic.  The staff or servers do not have the ability to see and they make the experience much more authentic and personal - they make sure that you are comfortable with every step you take. Before heading into the dark dining room, your group are lined up holding each other's shoulders to be led to your tables. It was so much fun because every time a plate of food came our way, it would be interesting to see how we could locate our utensils and almost forgetting where our mouths were (lol). Every time my partner and I tried to feed each other, I would either shove the food near his eye, nose, basically anywhere but his mouth hahaha. The food was great and I was just in so much awe with how precise our servers were and how much of a great job they did working their way through everything in the restaurant.   Customers; there were two ladies that ruined the whole experience for us because they were being so rowdy and at one point decided to pull out their phones and use the flashlight app. Unfortunately, with that we were able to see where we were seated and how the whole setup of the room was. We were all so mad and frustrated at this point because if they didn't want to dine in the dark, why bother going through it at all."}
{"text":"The experience of eating blind is great fun, albeit  a little messy. It's something I recommend anyone interested try. However, it's probably not worth the return visits.  Most people I talk to complain about the food. I understand that as a restaurant food is most important. But in my opinion, you don't come to. O.Noir for the food, you come for the experience. As far as the food goes, \"Fine\" is the best word I can think of. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. When you can't see, there's a comfortability in predictable food. Especially stuff that's not too gross to eat with your hands  My favourite part of the dinner is being brought in making a chain with all the diners' hands. As well as being oriented to find the cups and cutlery. My friends and I were laughing at each other when we first tried to eat. Everyone went in expecting to use their cutlery, but most of us used our hands. It was funny how loud we would talk even when we knew everyone was at the same table. While we consciously understand that people are there, it's hard for our bodies to figure that out.   However, as a restaurant that specializes in dining without the sense of sight, O.Noir does very little to play with your other senses. With a heightened sense of touch, you can really feel the cheap furniture and place settings. One dollar plastic placemats and old banquet chairs don't feel great to use at a restaurant that charges $50 a person (and probably saves tons of cash on their electric bill). The room was very loud as well. I don't blame the restaurant for people talking loudly (I was guilty), but if there's a way to soundproof better, they should consider it.   Overall, it was a fun experience I'll always remember, but probably not one I'll visit here again."}
{"text":"The overall experience was excellent and really fun. The only reason for a loss of stars is because the food was expensive but very mediocre and not spiced very well."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Dining in the dark definitely heightens the taste buds and makes you listen to your stomach when you are full versus looking at your plate. Also a great way to supporting the visually impaired. They were fantastic with their service and allows us to have a glimpse of what they go through each day. Thanks for serving us Nasir! He kept checking up on us and food was brought out promptly. Would recommend the portabello mushroom salad and octopus for starters!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible,  my steak tasted like meat loaf smothered with salty gravy.  Noise level was way too high not a place where you can enjoy your meal.  Please don't bring your date there if you're trying to impress her.  My salad was cucumber, tomatoe and onions and feta cheese .... puke .. I can make better salad than that. I had a slice of caramel cheese cake to go only because I couldn't stand the nuisance of people talking over one another.  Believe me when I said your local bakery would of been better. 3 course meal and my total damage was $50 :/ Yeappp ... feeling getting wripped off with nasty cafeteria food. By all means give it a shot.   But you might as well throw in a microwave dinner and shut off the kitchen light and pretend you're there.  Ps: Are all the servers really blind ????? Makes me ponder ????  Pss: I wanted to rate them (-) stars, guess that's not possible"}
{"text":"Location: It's located at Church and Wellesley, a few minutes walk from Wellesley station. The front door is under an awning, and you have to go downstairs.  Price: Two courses for $33, three courses for $40.  Food: The food in the Toronto one was pretty average compared to the one in Montreal. The hot buns were really delicious. It might have to do with it being the first positive sensory experience after your sight has been stripped away. Make sure you know what you're getting (unless you ordered surprise), because they got our order wrong TWICE. The guy beside us also got the wrong order, but he kept eating, thinking he'd eventually taste some octopus (he didn't, and couldn't return it because they couldn't verify a wrong order on an empty plate).   Atmosphere: This is probably 80% of what you're paying for. The place is not just dark, it's pitch black. Your eyes do NOT adjust, and it's probably the closest experience to being blind. You're not allowed cellphones or flashlights. It's definitely a nice honeymoon-phase date place because you can get to know them on a deeper level without getting distracted by their looks (and if you don't kept talking, you won't know if your date has secretly slipped away). Also a good excuse to hold hands (\"I'm scared!\" \"I just wanna know how far away you are\", etc.).  Service: I love the concept of this restaurant because they hire visually impaired waitstaff. They're extremely kind and personable, and they become your saving grace once you enter the dark restaurant. They guide you to your seat, feed you, and help you leave. You learn what it's like to be vulnerable and hopefully you're humbled by the experience and become a better person.   Overall: I personally think the food is just am accessory to the experience. Book ahead because it fills up fast. Also if you're going in the winter, wear 3 sweaters because it was freezing in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I would review the experience 3.5, our server was really nice he deserves at least 4.0. But the food was horrible, our appetizers and main were really cold and no good texture or taste (appetizers: grill calamari and the peppers, main: both of us ordered fillet mignon) my fillet was burned even though I ordered rare, my husband's was not that bad, I don't think the cooker knew how to prepare them. I would suggest to this restaurant to offer just cold meals like wraps, even sandwiches, or something else, just cold plates and maybe simple ones, it is better to offer something no that fancy but good than fancy and horrible. My other suggestion would be to offer more desserts that do not involve chocolate."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a unique experience that immersed me into darkness. The decor seemed Irish pub style in the bar area. The dining room is of course pitch dark and requires imagination to picture the surroundings.  We were provided with dulled cutlery and plastic cups for drinking (safety first of course), along with normal plates and casual dining music in the back ground. I would have liked if there were table linens; I mean hey if they get stained or are awful colours no one will know. The important thing would just be that they are clean. The food was very good.  We tried squid and calamari for appetizers and the steak for our main. We couldn't see the presentation of the food but the flavours and textures were good.  Tender steak, crisp green beans and chunky mashed potatoes. Finding all the beans in the dark was hide and seek. I tried to use only my cutlery, but resorted to cheating and used my finger tips to explore the plate and find those last hidden morsels. I found myself feeling a little sad because I ate the last piece of steak without knowing it; I think I would have savoured it longer. Our waiter was patient and gave clear instructions to ensure our escort through the dining room and meal were without knocks, bumps and crashes in the dark. Using my other senses was interesting and the experience highlighted my true reliance for sight during a normal dinner out. I would try it again and perhaps chose the 'surprise me' menu option next time to \"up\" the challenge."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon I believe $68 for 2; 3 course dining experience. It was great! My first time there, but my hubby's third time and he still enjoyed it.  The regular price is 39.95 for 3 course. There is also option to get 2 courses only.  I made reservations for a Thursday evening, the later service for 8:15pm. We arrive at 8:05 and the lobby was already full of guests waiting to be seated. It's best to come a bit earlier than your reservation because it does take at least 10 minutes to decide what to order and ensure you use the restroom beforehand. The menu is great- only a few choices and if you felt spontaneous enough there's a mystery choice for your appetizer, main or dessert.  I opted for the octopus app, shrimp main and a mystery dessert. My hubby ordered the arugula, the filet mignon and the fruit sorbet.  I really enjoyed the personal service here. Once we had our our order in, we were introduced to our server (Dave) and he showed us to our room and seats. There are a few rooms which you can potentially be seated in.  Once you get in there are a series of 2 doors to ensure no light does get in. The first few minutes were probably the best since it's so mysterious and kind of scary!  We were seated and told where the dishes are and what to expect on the table. A hot dinner roll came, it was very very hard to get any butter on the dinner roll lol!  For the apps, the arugula was very sour from the dressing. The octopus was pretty firm. The mains were great. The filet mignon was awesome, flavourful and melts in your mouth. Came with mash potatoes which was great too. The shrimp was very charcoaled and very Smokey! So if you enjoy the smokiness the shrimp is awesome. It also comes with risotto and some vegetables.  My dessert was average - the mystery item was a mousse cake. I heard the mystery items change up quite a lot.  My hubby's fruit sorbet was great tho! I enjoyed that very much.    We finished at around 10:19pm. So it was almost 2 hours for the 3 course. We did have to call our server when we were done with our desserts so that we could leave lol.  Other than that. I enjoyed the experience very much. Not very often that we do not have our phones out during dinner so it was a very nice change for once.   I always thought this place would be a been once done that deal but I truly would come again!  I would definitely order the filet mignon next time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was so excited for this experience and left feeling annoyed and disappointed.   When you are eating in the dark all of your other senses become heightened. So I guess I was expecting something wonderful for my other senses. Maybe nice soft table linens and napkins, textures cutlery, nice music playing in the background and mouth watering food. What we got was very different.   It took an hour for our appetizers to come. We got one cheap thin hotdog stand napkin, in a place where you are eating blindly!!! There was absolutely no music playing, it was like you were eating in a loud cafeteria. The plates and cutlery also felt like they were straight out of a cafeteria.   The salad starter was drenched in so much dressing it was inedible, but I couldn't send it back cause the server never came to check on us...ever.  We finally just had to start yelling out his name cause you can't see anything. My husband got the tuna steak. It was so dry that the only way we could choke it down was to mash it up and mix it in the mashed potatoes. For dessert I had the cheesecake and my husband had the chocolate cake and ice cream. The cheesecake wasn't bad and the cake wasn't terrible but the ice cream was almost totally melted.   Also remember that you have cheap paper napkins while basically eating with your hands, luckily I alway carry wet wipes with me.  And when we were finally done, we again had to yell out for our server to lead us out of the room.   The servers have way to many table to wait on and were not able to give any personalized service. Never once through the meal were we asked if we needed anything like more water or how were we enjoying the meal. I feel that Onoir could be amazing but instead completely missed the mark. It was the only restaurant I've eaten at since moving to Toronto were I left feeling completely disappointed.   If you are looking for an amazing unique experience with great food and service do not come here."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you go once and that's it.  It was fun for the first time but the food really wasn't that good and not really worth the money.  However the experience was what you're paying for.  Our waiter was blind so that was truly unique.  You choose your entrees outside and wait to be seated.  Our waiter comes out and has you place your hand on his shoulder as he leads you into the dining area.  The dining area is in complete darkness.  He seats you and takes your hand and shows you were all the utensils and glasses are by touch.  Everyone talks pretty loud in there without any filters because no one can see who is talking anyways.  It got pretty funny listening to other stranger's conversations.  We did have fun trying to eat and drink in the dark.  It was a challenge.  I ended up just scooping my food into my mouth off the plate....fine dining!   As I said, the food was so so and it's really for the experience.  They say being blind heightens your other senses, but the food was only okay with my heighten senses."}
{"text":"Right. Before the review begins, this is the only restaurant I have been to that does not seem to care about constructive criticism. Heres why: While having a great time due to the darkness and novelty experience, guests including us have more or less been complaining about the mediocre food since 2008, so I will start with that point as well.   Food We were a foursome and all tried different dishes. Steak, Chicken, Shrimp and Pasta. While the steak was cooked fine (get it rare), the vegetables were bland and drenched in fat, shrimp overcooked, the risotto was a joke - you could have stood on it. The deserts were clearly bought in. Your standard high-trans fat for-shelf-life glucose bombs. Thanks for heating the bread to pretend you are a fine-dining place, that ultimately lifted expectations to get disappointed even more. It is difficult to understand, how a restaurant with such short menu fails to deliver any sort of quality on each dish.   Value  And while the servers may be legally blind, the operations management surely is not, but they compensate well with ignorance. Also, they need vision to count the cash before laughing themselves to sleep every night. Really and truly: I dont understand why they seem to have no ambitions to improve.  Ambience Ambi...what? Its pitch dark. Before you go in there is an old-school, dusty foyer with pricey drinks being served. Nuff said.   Rating (2 Stars total) Five stars for novelty effect, friends telling great jokes and the good cause One star for a missed opportunity to wow guests using their only sense left Zero stars for lowest quality-to-price ratio ever experienced in a restaurant   Alternatives Order good take-out food, turn off the lights and donate $5 to your favorite charity  Reviewed March 2012"}
{"text":"For the experience, 5 star. The food was 3-4 star depending on what you ordered. Do the surprise dishes for sure! Would recommend this experience to anyone who visits Toronto"}
{"text":"An Interesting experience. The food was good. Not amazing. I really enjoyed talking with my date in the dark. Only thing I didn't like was that they cut up my steak. I would've like to take on that challenge myself. Fun place. Note: they don't serve drinks in the lounge"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of coming here after reading the reviews.  However, I had a great experience!  Our server was Nasir, and he was great.  We had order the appetizer, meal, drink and dessert as a surprise.  I was in hopes that my date and I were able to each have something different, but we ended up with the same things. Overall, the food was good but this is definitely, a place that you are paying for the experience, which is hard to come by.  From what I could hear, Nasir was the only server attending to everyone and he brought everything in a timely manner.   Coming here is a bit pricey, but I think it's a great experience in general.  I definitely would recommend it for the experience.  Guessing what you are eating makes it more enjoyable.   We had the Filet Mignon served with mash potatoes and green bean. The mashed potatoes were nice and hot.  The steak was not as hot or as big as I expected, but it was seasoned well!  The surprise starter, from my guess was a delicious salad. Overall, the portions were good.   We used a groupon coupon, however you are required to pay 18% tip and I believe there was a issuing fee as well that you do not pay when you get the coupon off the site.  I think if you're the type who is going to fancy restaurants and expecting top notch quality, this is not your cup of tea.  This place is more for people with an open mind."}
{"text":"Long story short, very gimmicky and not worth it.  The food was subpar and extremely overpriced. The foods were very typical and boring, like... Grilled chicken, a Caesar salad, vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake, etc. The most exciting thing on the menu was perhaps the grilled octopus but it wasn't tasty, and I've had plenty of octopus before to compare and know how a properly prepared octopus should taste like.  The section of the restaurant that was lit didn't look too hygienic. Once inside the dark room, I was feeling the table and the chairs and some parts felt sticky.  The server was very friendly but service was incredibly slow. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the server was friendly.  We got a Groupon but taxes and tip were an additional $22. The food and experience were not worth it, even when the Groupon discount. The darkness didn't enhance the taste experience of these poorly prepared dishes.  I hear that there are better dark dining restaurants in other cities."}
{"text":"Dining in the dark was an interesting experience but the food was meh and when I was paying the person at the front pressed the tip bottom for me (20%tip) which I was mad about considering it should be my decision on how much I wanted to tip."}
{"text":"\"Walk a mile in my shoes\"  Ever think that being blind would be easy? Think you will be the next Devil of Hell's Kitchen? Think again.  This restaurant allows you to truly walk the same path as a blind person and I must say, it is not an easy undertaking.  I have been in the dark many times, like before bed etc but the level of darkness and atmosphere is just different.  This place puts you in a social situation in which you need to use fine motor skills to eat, navigate to and from places and something as simple as \"Hey, try this piece of steak girl across from me\" ends up becoming a huge logistical undertaking worthy of it's own episode of Extreme Engineering!  I highly recommend going with a group of four or more since it is actually a very fun place.   I give it 5 stars for the experience since it is a unique concept that had spread all over mainly through word of mouth.  The food however is mediocre but good enough. Like I said, it's all about the experience.  A great place to try but in reality, you will have a one nighter here, it will be an evening to remember, you will never come back but will relive the experience for years to come."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7 other friends a few weeks ago and it'll be the unique circumstances you'll remember and unfortunately not the food: walking to your table all conga line style, realizing how hard it is to use a fork in the dark, the way conversation changes without visual cues, and , hopefully, a FOOD FIGHT like our table had. Haha. Chocolate mousse everywhere...I would not want to see what our table looked like. The food itself just isn't that interesting or unique. I ordered 2 surprises for dessert and appetizer hoping to actually BE surprised and try something unique. Unfortunately, they just ended up being a simple salad and a chocolate mousse. I was hoping to be guessing at what I was putting in my mouth! Sharing it with everybody going \"What IS this?!\" The filet mignon for the main was fine. It's just asparagus, steak and potatoes. Nothing exciting here, or unique in the preparation or flavours. Everything IS cut up into bite size chunks. Steak knives in the dark would be a really bad idea! Did the environment cause me to experience flavour differently? No not really. I was hoping for more risk/experimentation with the dishes. But it was something fun to try. Not really a date place (although if you could arrange to meet inside it would be a pretty cool blind date), so bring a group of people that already know each other."}
{"text":"This place is a gimmick my rating is 1 star because that's the absolute minimum I can give.   My girlfriend surprised me by bringing me here for my birthday. The experience starts out with you being led into a room where you pre-select your meal. I ordered the surprise vegetarian dish with the surprise desserts. My gf ordered Grilled Calamari with Tomato and O.Noir Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables.   You start out with bread and butter.   The grilled calamari was cooked well the sauce was pretty good. It came out within 20 minutes. A ponzu like sauce with tangy nodes.   The surprise vegetarian dish was easily one of the worst meals I HAVE ever HAD. The consistency all around was like eating baby food. The only positive was the vegetables were cooked well(no seasoning). The sauce was a sweet like and the \"noodles\" was some kind of vegetable made into noodles or spaghetti. The sauce did not work well with the dish, it was overly sweet and somewhat boring. This place uses very little seasoning (none on the table as well). You couldn't even pay me to eat that dish again. (absolute zero spice as well)  I tried some of my gf's potatoes and vegetables. Once again, no seasoning on the potatoes or vegetables, they were bland. However, they were cooked properly.   She said her meat was low quality, a lot of cartilage and tendons, we couldn't see if the meat was sliced properly either.   The surprise dessert was 3 SMALL pieces of cheese cake. I love cheese cake, it tasted good but for that price ($15), I would not be happy to pay for that.    Let me first start by saying I wasn't hungry going into the meal. I eat mostly vegetarian because of diet restrictions. Our waiter was friendly however, I think he was given too many tables or the kitchen didn't prioritize orders properly. We were seated pretty early in our dinner service as the tables started filling up and everyone took a seat, dishes started coming to the tables. After we received the calamari dish, we didn't get one for a good amount of time. In fact being in the dark and bored you hear things, we were one of the last people to receive our dish. (After I asked the server where our food was)   Service is bad, Price is laughable, but hey if you want to go sit in the dark and eat bad food be my guest. I would not recommend this place to anybody unless they had money to blow. And no you do not taste better in the dark.   All in all this place left a sour taste in my mouth both literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"Here for the experience not the food. Food is probably sub par, washrooms sloppy, servers are friendly, inspiration awesome. Maybe it wasn't as novel for me anymore, I've been once years ago before the era of yelp.   You walk down into the humid vintage basement of a hotel and walk into the sticky floors of waiting room. Someone takes your order and you meet your blind server who seats you in a pitch black dining room. Anxiety spikes but you soon calm down. Talking to other guests in the same experience helps.   The experience takes about 2 hours or more and if it's a full house (it was when I went) food takes longer to arrive and it can get very difficult to hear the people beside you. Get ready to accidently (or purposely) get your hands on your food.   I can handle spice but the calamari was surprisingly spicy and I didn't know when the next time I'd be able to get water was. The shrimp risotto could have used more than a dollop of risotto. The chocolate cake though, was delicious. I hear the fillet minon is good minus the burned parts and that the mousse is sweeter than probably necessary."}
{"text":"Great fun. The servers were very nice, and it was a neat experience eating in the dark. Actually experiencing the sensation of not knowing what things look like, or where they are, is mind opening. Food was good, service was a bit slow, servers were very nice and personable.  Would highly recommend, and would come back again."}
{"text":"The culinary experience is what you're paying for! And what an experience it was! I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we both loved every minute of it. The novelty of the entire experience and the appreciation of our own senses after it has culminated is a thing of surreal existentialism.   The food is mediocre, but like hundreds have said here... that ain't what you're paying for. You're paying for eating in the dark when you can't even see your own hand in front of you. You're eating in the dark where the only way you can make sure your sweetheart is still there is to hold her hand or play footsie! The romance of it all is quite ecstatic.   Go and experience it! :)"}
{"text":"What an experience it was! Loved this place. Defiantly worth going to for the experience not so much for the food. The surprised vegetarian was delicious but not so much a fan of there penne pasta with cream sauce. The waitress was really nice and she gave us good directions as to where to sit and walk. Also, where our drinks and food is. I couldn't have asked for a better night spending it in the dark with other strangers not knowing what we're going to eat..good laughs and wine spilled at the end of the night lol. A day in the life of a blind person, thankful for having my eye sight!"}
{"text":"I went to Onoir for the experience and not just the food.  I've been to the Montreal location and really had a great experience,  although there were members of my party that had slight panic attacks.   It's an experience that I have never went through and I feel like each time I go it's a bit different.  Eating in the dark not only heightens all your other senses, it also makes you aware of how much you know your surroundings!   The service at the Toronto location was good.  Our actual server (who was blind) was super helpful and got us everything we wanted quickly and guided us well throughout the darkness.  He was great in getting us drinks and brought the food out without ever spilling anything or knocking anything over (unlike us lol).  The hostess and people at the front however, took an extremely long time to get us to our table.  We waited over 30-40 minutes and I had reservations already.  The hostess finally told me she mixed up our table with another because another guest had the same name as I did.  I took off a star for that alone.  The food isn't the best you'll ever taste, but it's fun to eat in the dark, especially when you're trying the unknown mystery dishes.  Most of the food tasted average at best and it's really the experience you're paying for.  Although my friends tell me I can just eat at my own place and turn off all the lights and save myself $100...overall give it a try at least once.  It's a fun experience and I have all the respect in the world for the blind servers that work there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is about the dining in the dark experience, not so much about the food. I came here a while back, so I can't remember what I had, but it was decent, but nothing special (wine was good, though). I would rate the food a 3, and the experience a 4 - 5 (depends on who you are with and how fun you make it). I laughed a lot, and had a great time, and it was overall a cool experience. One of the people I was with interestingly mentioned that the restaurant doesn't have to worry about the presentation of the food.   I would recommend coming here at least once. I think this is a great first, second or third date idea. I also recommend having some drinks to make the experience even more interesting.   It is honestly beyond me how the servers bring the food and walk you to the bathroom when it is pitch black. Now that I think about it actually, the servers are visually impaired.  Overall, it was a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Food: 5/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 4/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 9/10  Would I come back? Probably not. It's more of a one-time experience thing.   O.Noir delivers on the experience. It really was pitch black. I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. And I got a discounted Groupon too, so tax and tip included, it was $40/person for a three-course meal, which I think was a good price considering you're paying for the gimmick.   WHAT I LIKED:  - We got to experience pitch black for a solid two hours.  - The \"surprise option\", which is something not even on the menu (as opposed to a surprise among the menu choices). This added a really fun element to guessing what you were eating since you couldn't see it.  - The food tasted decent. The temperature however...  WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  - The food choices. The food is really uninspired. Yes, the gimmick is darkness, but everyone is expecting to taste food more intensely because they can't see. Give us something exciting in taste or texture. My surprise appetizer was a salad: boring. The surprise main was actually not even a surprise because it was on the menu and I got the same thing as the rest of my table: boring. The surprise dessert was a lemon cheesecake: boring.   - The food was cold. The hottest thing we ate was the bread at the beginning, and even with that, our first piece of bread was room temperature and the second one was piping hot. There are some consistency issues. Other reviews have said the same thing and we told the staff when we paid and they said they'd let the chef know. It's clear they have no intention of fixing it or that they've heard the same thing before. It has nothing to do with the chef. You can't cook food cold. It gets cold when you leave the food sitting.  - The wait. Between our appetizer and main, it must've been an hour wait considering we were there for two hours and left immediately after our dessert. We were really hungry by then and asked the waiter. He replied, \"This isn't fast food; it's an experience,\" which is true and false, but also rude. It's an experience, but the experience is dining in the dark, not waiting forever for your food.   - The staff. It's one thing to know you'll be eating in darkness and another to experience it. One person in our party discovered they weren't comfortable with it once we entered the room and asked to leave. Our waiter replied, \"Well, I wish you would've told me that in the test room,\" which is really insensitive and also unreasonable. We didn't even know what test room he was talking about (I'm assuming it's the little room right before the dining area, but no one ever identified it or told us the purpose) and that is the wrong way to address someone who is having an anxious response to the experience. It would be helpful if in this supposed test room, the waiter would give a little spiel, like \"This is the test room. For the next two hours, you will be eating in pitch darkness, so get a feel for this and if you're okay, we can proceed. If at any time, you would like to leave, just call out and I will escort you outside.\" Furthermore, he made no indication that he was going to escort them outside, so when they had to explicitly say, \"I can't do this. I have to leave,\" the waiter replied, \"No, you're going to have to wait. People are coming in and out,\" which is a reasonable thing that should have been communicated earlier, with different words, and in a different tone.  - While it's mostly pitch black, you can see a sliver of light at the bottom of the door if you're facing that way. When other customers come in and out, that light will appear again, sometimes full door width-height light if they don't time the closing of the doors properly. Maybe adding something on the bottom of the door will minimize that. It was really dark, but it would've been nice if it was pitch black the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here tonight and must say that it was a very interesting experience. I had heard of o noir for a while now and when it came up on groupon I thought why not give it a try. I'm really glad I did.  We went to the 8:15 seating. When we arrived we were given a menu and ordered everything beforehand. My groupon included a three course meal. The menu wasn't extensive but there was at least five different options for the appetizer and main course. Dessert only had three options. There's also a surprise option for each course for those who want to get really adventurous.   I ordered the grilled octopus which was really very good. It was cooked just right and the marinade was delicious. I had the filet mignon as my main. The meat was very juicy and tender and it came with mashed potatoes and string beans. Portion size was also decent. I finished off my meal with a fruit sorbet. Very refreshing end to the meal.  The whole experience was great. You eat in a pitch dark room. Your eyes do not adjust and you can't see a single thing in front of you. I can understand why some people would be uncomfortable. It really takes eating to a whole other level as you have to rely on your other senses. I think you are seated pretty close to the other people around you as others conversations seemed pretty loud. There were times when it was difficult to hear my husband who was sitting right next to me.  We had Dave as our server and thought he did a really amazing job. Whenever he came to check on us or deliver food he would do it just far way enough that we wouldn't get startled. The only thing that could have been better was that I found out later that my sorbet came with a side of fruit. The sorbet was in a bowl that was in a large plate. But no one told me there was anything on the plate so I missed the fruit. No big deal but would have been nice to be given a heads up about.  All in all the quality of the food served was quite good and I was very satisfied with the service. I'm not sure if I would pay full price but if you can get a deal I would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner while we were visiting Toronto.  It was the most amazing experience. The food was amazing as was the staff. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has an adventurous spirit and is willing to try something so out of the norm and that takes you out of your comfort zone.You will leave with memories that will last a lifetime."}
{"text":"We went to the early dinner seating at O. Noir (in downtown Toronto) on 8/18/17.  We hadn't been there previously, and were intrigued by the description / info we saw online.  All in all, it's an experience worth having.  Our server (\"Dave\") was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  My wife and both found the food to be quite good (my wife had filet mignon, I had shrimp risotto) ... contrary to much critical input we'd seen online.  We were initially \"underwhelmed\" by the less-than-warm and not-particularly-friendly demeanor of the greeting staff (who greet you in the arrival area and take your dinner order), but my wife struck up a conversation with the young lady who took our order and identified a common link to a Michigan community.  This seemed to \"break the ice\", and the staff member was then considerably more outgoing and pleasant.  Again, we found this to be a dining experience worth having ... but we grew a bit weary of the unique nature of \"dining in the dark\" by the time dessert was to be served.  So, we invited Dave to bring the check as we'd be leaving as soon as we enjoyed our chocolate cake (which was also pretty tasty!).   O. Noir is worth experiencing ... but once will do it for us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to O.Noir on a Saturday. I ordered the surprise appetizer and the surprise main course while my boyfriend ordered the surprise main course and the surprise dessert. I ended up eating the food with my hands because it kept falling off my fork. The food was good, but it didn't leave us feeling full. It was such a cool experience and our server was fabulous. I would recommend that you go to this place for the experience and not necessarily for the food."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Great experience - Great food - Great service (waitress)  Cons: - Staff at checkout seemed unfriendly and added 18% gratuities without our consent  We went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago. We were a group of four. We found the experience of eating in absolute darkness unique and recommend it to others to try it at least once.  We actually found the food, despite some other reviews, to be really good. Our waitress was friendly and did a great job serving us in absolute darkness.   When we were leaving to pay our bill we were kind of disappointed at the staff working at the checkout. In the menu it was specified that 15% gratuities are added to the bill for a group of 6 or more. However they charged us 18% gratuities. On top of that, despite of us having a groupon they added 18% gratuities to the full amount and not the discounted amount which is against the terms specified by groupon. The staff was rolling their eyes just because we were reviewing the bill. We don't mind giving 18% or more in tip if the service is justified but we should be allowed to choose the amount on our own. It's the principle that matters hence the low rating.   Either way, we recommend the experience to others. Just be aware of the 18% gratuities they automatically add. I'm sure you can refuse to pay that, we didn't want to make a scene and didn't argue with them about it. Maybe that's what they are going for but that means that they are trying to rip you off."}
{"text":"The experience of dining the absolute darkness is a worthy one to collect. I ordered a vegan starter and vegan entree. For me, the portion size was too small. I ate a burrito and veggie hot dog afterwards. The service and idea of the restaurant is definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! Food and staff were an absolute delight! If it's your first time going, it won't be in one of the buildings, it will be more life a subway entrance but with a blue banner that says O.Noir. Go down the stairs, there's metered parking btw so bring change. You can get coat check as well, it's $2.50/jacket, no big deal, and the the attendant that you interact with is super friendly and pleasant. It's a great restaurant, I really encourage you to spend the extra cash on the 3-course meal to gain the most out of your experience. The servers are fantastic! They give clear instructions and are readily available with a quick holler. The food was so good! Perhaps the setting affected my senses a bit but my taste buds will not lie. I had the steak and every bite was flavourful and tender, what a great steak! The desert was definitely the last piece of the puzzle to settle my sweet tooth and certainly did not disappoint. This restaurant is great for a friendly first date or group gathering, I wouldn't recommend babies or children younger than 11-12 to attend. I can't wait to go again! This place would also be great for having your birthday dinner, I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The environment was awesome. Server was the best i could ever ask for. Food was good, especially the penne and the calamari. My boyfriend and i had the most fun here because we couldn't see anything. All we could focus on was each other and the food. Only thing was that the later it got, the more people there were and that meant the room got a lot louder. It was difficult to hear my partner. Prices were a little bit on the costier side but definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"wow! what an experience! i am a foodie and i am a tactile person! i have the nose of a blood hound and my taste buds are pretty wicked in being able to name off what seasonings are in a dish.. so you can imagine how excited i was going there.   there were 10 of us. that is 6 too many! haha! it was sensory overload!! haha!   first you start off in the lounge area where you can have drinks while they prepare your dining space. this is where you go over the menu and decide what you are having. then your server who is visually impaired tells you how things are going to go.. so we all line up single file behind each other.. each of us placing our hand on the shoulder of the person in front of us. we are lead into foyer before the dining area.. so it starts to get dark.. then we enter the dining area and you can't see a thing!!!   once we are all seated, our server took our drink order and asked for our names one by one. i told our server i recognized him from ryerson university and seeing him on the streetcar with his daughter in the mornings. he seemed pleased by this.   upon his return he had already started to remember some of our names. he then asks what app, entree and dessert we are having as each course is about to happen.   so you are sitting there in complete darkness.. you can't see your hand.. one friend sounded like they were at the other end of the table and they were right beside me.. then the person in front of me sounded so far away! when it comes to eating i just used my hands.. why bother with cutlery!!   i had a salad which tasted fresh.. mushrooms.. lettuce.. nuts.. tasty. then my entree was a beef dish with roasted veggies.. well this is where my taste buds and my brain clashed!! the beef tasted like poo to me :0( i would eat a veggie and go back to the beef but it still tasted bad. luckily dessert was delicious!  so if you go.. keep your dinner party small.. no more than 4 people.. and be prepared for an awesome and possibly overwhelming experience! :0)"}
{"text":"You come here for the experience, NOT for the food.  You pick out food ahead of time and then you are lead into the dining room which is LEGIT black.  You see absolutely NOTHING.  I ended up just closing my eyes during dinner because there was no point having them open.  It's really fun to go with a group of friends, steal each others food, eat with your hands, find out what surprise plates are.  But i would not suggest going with people you are not close with because silence is SILENT haha.    I started with the Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Parmigiano and Balsamic Vinegar on a Mixed Green Salad and I actually really enjoyed this. It was nice that I kept finding new mushrooms on my plate when I thought I was already done.  My main was the Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables.  This was really bad. seriously like banquet food or like a TV dinner and it was lukewarm.  The vegetables were frozen veggies and this is kinda sad considering u are paying 40 bucks for your meal. I finished with the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream.  The ice cream was really good  and I ended up scooping the entire ice cream up and putting it all in my mouth because it was too hard to eat in the dark. But the cake was wayyy too rich for my liking.  It was also kinda hard and had a nasty cheap chocolate icing.  didn't finish this.  The restaurant itself is pretty old, smells funny and we kept saying how it had the feel of an old country buffet restaurant or a retirement home.  I'm really curious what the actual eating area even looks like.  Overall it's fun but I will not be returning ever again.  For $40 you can have a great meal elsewhere if u don't care to experience eating in the dark."}
{"text":"Totally worth trying ONCE- and highly recommended for a date or to bring a close friend from out of town.  Keep your party small though- to four people. So y'all know this is dining in the dark but here are a few facts you may not know: -There are four rooms and each room seats about 30 people. -The rooms are long, and you will be seated beside a wall- don't worry, you wil at least have ONE point of reference! -Servers are visually impaired -cleaners/bussers wear night vision -yes.  it is completely dark.  How dark?  completely. -you preorder- the surprise menu is fun/good, but by no means get it if you know EXACTLY what you want.  I ordered the Mushroom, Steak and Chocolate Cake.   Mushroom was VERY flavourful- be careful of the mouthful of cheese! Steak was good (precut)- done perfectly (medium rare) Cake and ice cream were delicious had a house red wine- FULL glass  My dining partner ordered the suprise menu which consisted of: Roasted veg salad Mushroom chicken chocolate mousse (he specified) had a surprise drink (rum and rye).  Now, for the surprise menu I actually expect a challenge- I WANTED it to be super complex flavours and have fun figureing it out- but both of us got it right away.  This is why it's only three stars.  This is DEFINITELY a concept that you MUSt try but the food isn't good enough to actually come back.  at 39$ for 3 courses, VERY healthy portions, good food and a great unique experience DO IT. But there really is no reason to do it more than once."}
{"text":"Tired of just walking in and ordering off a menu?  O Noir puts a spin to dining out.  You have no idea what you're eating.  It was plenty of fun and great experience.   I knocked off 1 star because the food quality didn't reflect the price, but you're not really here to be a foodie but rather to try eating in total darkness."}
{"text":"Some restaurants have a unique niche and generally they should be applauded for it. However it does not matter how great that niche is, if the food is not great, then well, you are just not a great restaurant.  O.Noir has a GREAT niche which boils down to: You dine in pitch darkness. So yes, by all means, come out and give it a try, once. Maybe twice. It makes for an interesting date at some point in your dating life or to invite friends who come from out of town.    For those wondering, you arrive at the restaurant, and spend some time at their bar meanwhile they prepare your \"room\" for the dining experience as you order your meal in advance. The rooms are large and can hold a number of tables, so no, you two (or four) will not dine alone.  You are ushered by the serving staff, who are blind themselves, to your table and there, you wait, you chat, and eventually as the food is served, you eat.   My date and I were seated against the wall, which made the whole experience fairly easy for me as I could use the wall as a 3D point of reference to where everything else was even in total darkness. I would assume the experience would have been a bit different if we sat away from the wall.     One of my friends who had recommend the place had hinted that your senses get used to the darkness and that the meal may taste different because of it.   I had no such experience, the food tasted like it was meant to taste. Was it \"sensual\" as it described on their website? No. It was a bit fun yet still, the old saying that your other senses get  enhanced due to the lack of sight may be true although not something that is going to happen in 1 hour. Unlike the blind servers who for what I could hear were able to easily maneuver the room while carrying everyone's food from sheer memory alone.  How about the food you ask? I found the food, for the price, to be okay. It was just alright and really not all that memorable. I had the Filet Mignon with potatoes and vegetables and the strongest memory I have is of eating the carrots due to their shape. Even when special attention was paid due to the fact I could not see what I was eating, the whole thing was just alright. I was probably more excited about the company than the whole experience.    Definitely worth doing so you can say you have tried it although I would not suggest repeated visits. I mean, why? You could probably replicate the experience at your own home and maybe, even with better food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a humbling experience. The whole room was giggling as everyone tried to butter their dinner rolls (I ended up with butter on my lap... I would recommend wearing clothes you don't mind getting a little food on!). We shared a surprise starter and a surprise dessert and we are so glad we did! Ordering a surprise lets you have a little fun with the experience. Our waiter Nazir was great and helped to increase our comfort level with his guidance and explanations."}
{"text":"Yuck.   I am a huge fan of the  Montreal location and was looking forward to taking some friends to the Toronto O.Noir, that was a bad idea.   Unlike the Montreal location,  there are no lockers to keep your belongings, the bathroom isn't clean and the chairs and table were super uncomfortable.   Our food took forever and it was cold when it arrived and our waiter didn't tell us what we had after each dish, there was no explanation or anything. At the middle of the meal we started rationing our water, because we knew that it would take forever to get more.    I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a once in a lifetime experience in Toronto! It truly is pitch black in there, and I thought it would be scary but it's actually okay. I also want to reiterate what so many people have said before: Dave is awesome! He's attentive and kind and full of good humour! We had the three course meal and everything was pretty good!  For appetizers, we both agreed that the octopus was better than the calamari because the pieces are larger with more flavour My steak was delicious, and the shrimp with rice was so good, even though the rice was a bit undercooked. Desserts we went with a surprise! And it was a delicious berry cheesecake. Empty plates back to the kitchen! It is definitely a unique experience, and the first taste of every part of the meal just bursts with flavour. Would go again  for another special occasion :-)"}
{"text":"I was visiting this from the U.S. for a friend's birthday, and it was a great experience. When other reviewers here wrote that your eyes never adjust, I was like, naah, they'd have to adjust eventually. They DON\"T. You eat in complete pitch black darkness the whole time. I'd recommend ditching the silverware and just eating with your hands; eating with your hands with no sight definitely enhances the experience, because we rarely pay attention to texture.  I know other reviewers didn't especially like the food. I personally loved my (pre-cut steak) the desert was good, not pheonominal but good, and the appetizer was good.   My friend had the surprise option, but most of the items were variants of things on the menu, so she was disappointed on that. The surprise items she said weren't that special either; so you could just do one surprise item and then pick out the rest.   Definitely recommend at least once"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come and experience O Noir.  I first hear about it through a friend and I never got around to going.  For Christmas, I got a Buytopia coupon and used it recently.  We walked in and it was kind of dark and antique looking.  We had to walk all the way to the end of the building to be greeted by a hostess, whom gave us a menu to choose the 3 course dinner we would like.  I decided to go with their grilled calamari with tomato as the appetizer, filet mignon served with potatoes and vegetables my main, and dark chocolate mousse with cocoa powder for my dessert.  The boyfriend decided to go with the grilled octopus with olive oil and lime, marinated shrimp with herbs served with risotto and vegetables, and for dessert went with chocolate cake with rich vanilla ice cream.  After choosing the food items we wanted, we were introduced to Nasir who was our server for the night.  He walked us through, giving us thorough instructions on where everything was as we were walked into the dining area in the dark.  He seated us each individually and explained to us where our plates and cutlery were on the table.  At first, we were confused as to where everything was and how this whole experience would work.  We walked in and the noise level was incredibly loud for a monday night especially with a large group of young teenagers that were very rowdy and obnoxious. They were screaming and yelling at the fact that they couldn't see.  It's hard at first to adjust to such darkness and to have a conversation with the person in front of you.  Nasir came back and served us bread and appetizer and at first we both were very formal, using forks and knives to eat our food, but by the end of it, we both ended up using our hands to eat because there was no way to know whether our plates were finished or where the food was on our plates.  We were even discussing about whether or not the presentation of the food was nice to begin with because no one sees it and if they just put the food on a plate and serve it to you.  Overall, the food was mediocre, some dishes I would recommend over others. But I thought it was a good experience, especially because you get to experience what it is like to be visually impaired.  And what makes it more interesting is that all the servers that work there are visually impaired.  I would definitely recommend coming here at least once just for the experience, but I think the food definitely needs some improvement.  O Noir and good night!"}
{"text":"The eating in the dark experience is a must. I found the food very bland though. The service was very unique and our waitress was awesome. I would recommend going here for the experience but not so much for the taste of the food"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place so much! I was worried, because several reviews mentioned the food being not wonderful, so I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. (nota bene: I had the chicken - great, my partner had the filet - great, but my daughter did have the pasta and it wasn't as great). Our server was Dave, who was just as fabulous as other reviews mentioned. I am hard-of-hearing, and also wasn't sure how it would go as I typically lip-read, but Dave was great about speaking very close to my hear so I could understand. I feel like this is a must-do for everyone once. I found eating in the dark not as difficult as I expected, but it was surreal how I kept expecting my eyes to adjust (spoiler: they didn't). I think if I went back, I would get the main and appetizer, instead of main and dessert. I was worried about the \"surprise\" aspect of the appetizer, but I think I'm ready for that now! It was a little expensive, but with the exchange rate for USD, tax and tip had me about $100 for three people. If you're hesitant, I encourage you to try and open your mind for this unique experience."}
{"text":"This was definately an interesting experience if you are looking for something different.  I get the fact that it's going for something different and the whole other senses heighten when one sense is taken away... but at the at the end of the day, restaurants should still be about food.  The diverse experience: you walk down the stairs to the actual restaurant, which looks like an old stable-esque steak house feel.  Everything is dimly lit as you check in with the hosts and order from the menu.  The menu is broke down into a prix-fixed selection: Appetizer (4 choices), Main (about 5), and Desert (about 4).  You can either choose $32 two-course meal or $39 three-course meal.  Once you are finished with your selection, you are guided into a separate room where your visually-impaired servers lead you to your table.  Note, it's PITCH BLACK.  Your eyes will not adjust to the darkness, it's black in there, can't see nothing, nada, zilch.  I had the GRILLED ONOIR OCTOPUS to start, which was actually quite good, but small.  My dining companion had the GRILLED CALAMARI, which was also quite good.  Both appetizers tasted fresh and it was over spring mix.  This was my favourite part of the meal.    For the main, I tried the FILET MIGNON, which was already cut up for you and it came with veggies and potatoes.  This was alright, nothing too special, nothing extrodinary.    We had the 2 course due to other plans.  I ended up eating with my fingers because I couldn't see a thing.  It was scary, loud and really cold in the room.  It was interesting but it made me feel kind of sick by the end of the meal.  Maybe it was the darkness that confused my senses?  Maybe it was the over air-conditioned room (made my food cold mid-meal)?    I like the concept a lot, but it was not for me.  If I could make one small suggestions, maybe serve a bigger portion, left feeling a touch hungry...  2 stars is harsh, I'd give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a unique dining experience.  At O Noir, you eat in the dark.  There is absolutely no light in the room whatsoever, most people have been in a dark room before, but this was my first completely dark room, no light whatsoever.  That was quite an experience in its own right.    You read the menus and order in a fully lit room, before being escorted to your seat by one of the blind waiters.  Both a fascinating and humbling experience.  The three course meal was delicious.  Salad, steak and cake.  The steak tasted perfect, I wouldn't be able to tell you if it was a little pink in the middle though.  I can say that this was definitely the most interesting dining experience I have had in Toronto.  I would heartily recommend this to any couple or group.  Just not for a first date. You can hear everything that is said by each person in the room, I was privy to something of a disastrous attempt at self conscious courtship."}
{"text":"We went here as a group and it was one of the best experiences we've ever had! The waiting staff were lovely. And being in the dark while eating and chatting was a great experience."}
{"text":"Such a neat idea! I love this place! Came here for my anniversary with my bf and we had a great time. The food was delicious. I think when you are not distracted by everything around you, the food tastes a lot better! I definitely gained a new appreciation for the blind after this experience. Most of us take our eyesight for granted when we shouldn't. I'm so glad to see restaurants like this that provide jobs for the disabled! Will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I wanted wait to write this review as I thought our disappointed dining experience was isolated, however, after additional feedback from our friends, it's time to get down to it. First and foremost, the dining concept, itself, is worth a try but the novelty wears thin if the food does not deliver.   My personal experience was disappointing to say the least. I decided to surprise the boyfriend with a new dining experience for his birthday, yes I am sure that you've read a similar experience in a previous post-yes, it is the same occasion from a different perspective. Long story short, the meal started amazing and went downhill from there. The darkness, although disorienting but tantalizing, once seated we received service fast with drinks and bread. The calamari app soon followed. The dish was promising, the texture and taste were well received, nicely paired with fresh tomatoes bits to provide a nice tart/sweet contrast. Once the server cleared our empty plates, we waited for quite some time in between courses. I ordered a med rare fillet mignon and the boyfriend took the plunge and got the \"surprise me vegetarian dish\".   I will start off with the positive. The vegetables on my plate were cooked well, lack any trace of seasoning, but cooked well. The meat I received was less than par. The meat was cooked rarer than what I requested but that was not my grief as I'm flexible on the rareness level. I had trouble understanding its texture, I've had fillet mignon and I should not have to chew through what I could only describe as connective tissues-though cut thin, the pieces were definitely tough and chewy. Not what you would expect at that price point. For the surprise dish, I was very aware that we were served spaghetti squash (we did not need that to be explained, but that's beside the point). The point we are trying to drive home is that it was not good and did not work on any gastronomic plane. Texture and taste is everything, especially with you cannot see the food or be distracted by presentation. The squash fine strands were completely submerged in the overly sweet sauce that obliterated any defining taste or characteristic of the actual squash. In the dark, it felt like you are eating a plate of mushy sauce entangled by random short strands of corn hair. Nothing about that plate was redeemable or worth its hefty price tag. Why we didn't complain or send it back? Similar to the experience of our friends' - recently, we were never approached by the server to ask how our experience was going throughout the meal, lest we shouted out for service and ruin the experiences for the other patrons, we didn't have many chances. Dessert was good, nothing mind-blowing but the 3 small cubular pieces of cheesecake signaled the end of our time there.   As for our friends' experience, I'll keep it short. I did not be any means influenced their opinion by any means before they dined. Service was not there. Food was not to par, the shrimp dish was over saturated in salt. The other ordered the fillet mignon and was also dissatisfied with what they got-dried and overcooked (also ordered medium rare) .   Overall, overpaid for novelty. Food and service left much to be desired and inconsistent. Our cases might be isolated but we definitely do not think that the price or the mandatory tip were warranted. We wish the restaurant all the best and hopefully others will enjoy what we did not."}
{"text":"Came for my boyfriend's birthday. The seafood was really good. We had the surprise seafood and I had shrimp risotto, they had a reaaaaally nice charred barbecue taste I loved it! The wine recommended was amazing as well. Our waiter was really nice too! It was kinda difficult to eat not knowing where everything is but it was an interesting experience. The only downside was waiting over 30min for the main course, I was starving!"}
{"text":"You legitimately eat in the dark. Might as well close your eyes. Got the filet mignon and it was delicious. The dessert was surprise and got done pumpkin dessert which was really good as well. Great experience. would definitely go again. Did I mention the filet mignon was delicious? It's a bit pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I agree that the novelty factor is a 5 star experience but the food isn't the greatest.  It's not bad but for 32 to 39 per person just for food (no drink), I expected much better I had the octopus and filet mignon.  The octopus was okay, but a tad salty and slightly chewy.  The filet mignon tasted good but it was the equivalent to the Keg, which is much cheaper.  I think if there was a special occasion, or someone out of town visiting, I might take them there, but its not a \"recurring\" everyday place.  Overall, not bad, but not wowed by any means."}
{"text":"My gf invited me to O.Noir for a belated birthday dinner.  Naturally, I turned to Yelp and was less than impressed by the mediocre reviews. Perhaps my experience was shaped by expecting less and then being pleasantly surprised, I don't know. I do know that O.Noir surpassed my expectations.   The waiting area was warm and inviting. Staff was available to answer questions about the menu and procedure. You pre-order your meal and are then led into the pitch black room by a friendly, visually impaired waiter.   At first, I felt a bit claustrophobic, but once I made it to my seat and felt the seating area and table placement with my hands, I relaxed. The room was somewhat noisy, likely because my sense of hearing was heightened. I ordered the fillet mignon, which came precut and was delicious. My gf opted for the suprise dish, which she guessed correctly was chicken and veggies. It was somewhat difficult to manage cutlery and I opted for eating with my hands when necessary - hey nobody's watching you! I found it surprisingly easy to converse about intimate topics, probably because I was under the cover of darkness! I'd recommend this as a place to bring a friend to talk about a sensitive issue or even for the ultimate \"blind date\"! Dessert was a delicious - rich chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream in a little bowl. I appreciated the ice cream on the side to avoid any potential mess from having it on top of the cake.   I recommend O.Noir as a great one-time experience (since it's a little pricey at $38 for a 3-course meal, $32 for 2-courses). Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"What a cool experience! I surprised my boyfriend with this for his birthday and it did not disappoint. The staff was incredibly friendly and our server made us feel very comfortable in a reality that was anything but within a seeing persons normal. Being in the room your other senses increase. As our server would bring the food or beer the first thing I noted was the smell. Usually secondary when food is brought to the table. We both chose to be surprised by our meals and in doing so found we really enjoyed foods neither of us normally would have picked off a restaurant menu. Great experience. Room for improvement would just be the waiting room it's big and has lots of seating but looks very dated. Overall great experience and I've recommended it to many friends and family."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! NOT SAFE! In a complete dark, a creepy stranger(s) kept sliding their hands up and down my legs and both hands every few minutes. Also had my plate of food stolen off the table in front of me.  My date and I felt completely uncomfortable. The servers couldn't help us. So my date and I left feeling violated."}
{"text":"I just went to O.Noir for the first time last night for a surprise birthday. The experience itself was really cool and also confronting. Having absolutely no vision meant we were very engaged as a group (with no one being able to text on their phones etc) and also humorous as people tried to feel their way around their plate to find their food.  I enjoyed the service I received. Our sever was very friendly and a few of our main dishes were late due to a mix up so he offered us an inconvenience discount without us even asking. The food however was completely unremarkable. There were limited vegetarian options for the main so I decided on the portobello mushroom app and tomato penne pasta main. The pasta was so average - I would have expected this of a cheap pub rather than a $$$ restaurant. I also ordered a gin crantini and not only did it not taste like gin it did not taste like cranberry...more like a cherry starburst liqueur.  Things I liked: - the novelty of the experience  - nice service and server - the discount for the wait was a nice touch - the fact that they offer surprise mains and desserts (fun) - the servers themselves are visually impaired and it must be a rewarding experience for them   Things to improve: - change up the food (this is a great opportunity to be different and utilize everyone's enhanced taste buds... So why be totally generic?) - offer more classic cocktails (what kind of full bar restaurant doesn't do mojitos?) - change up the wine list  Would I go back? Maybe if they changed the menu. I don't intend to pay for that pasta again.  * I would have liked to give this place 2 stars but I feel bad because the sever was so nice. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 on the Yelp rating system ;)"}
{"text":"Firstly let me say that I enjoyed my experience eating in the dark I think it's something that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime.  The food was excellent (I had the filet mignon) it was tender soft and just the right amount of flavor to tantalize the senses.  Potatoes and asparagus were amazing (I enjoy a bit of butter on my asparagus) the joy however was attempting to spear my food as the gravy caused the food to move around more than I would have liked   My appetizer was great as well...seasonal veggies with goat cheese...the goat cheese was so liberal, it was a refreshing change from other restaurants that sprinkle a little and charge you an arm and a leg for it  Now for the not so good...I am always blown away when I see more than $2.00 for any regular soft drink anywhere and on this occasion $2.95 for general soft drinks (coke sprite, ginger ale, etc) is not the best way to leave a positive experience in my mind...then to add the fact there are No refills well things weren't looking all that positive. I had the water cause hopefully water will continue to be free.  For you drinkers..wine list highly overpriced and nothing that lines up appropriately with the choices available  Lastly the desert menu is nothing special the chocolate cake tasted like dry McCain Deep and Delicious...with out the delicious part applying.  Our server was excellent (yes he was legally blind) and made for an enjoyable experience which is what I wanted  Ultimately I would go back simply because it's something out of the norm and the main course was certainly worth it.  If you are looking to go I would recommend the following:   1. Reserve your seating (3 choices) online, don't' call as the staff are incredibly busy   2. Look for a Groupon if you are concerned about cost - currently there is a $64 Groupon for two for a 3 course meal that you can purchase now and it expires in October 2014 otherwise it's $90.87 pretax  3. Look at the menu before hand online there are pictures that may help you make your choice of what you want to eat"}
{"text":"All the servers here are legally blind and it impresses me that they can maneuver around the restaurant with our food, lead us to our seats with ease etc. It also makes me happy that there are job opportunities for them here since it is catered to their expertise and I guess their experience."}
{"text":"My first mistake was coming back to O Noir for a second time in quite a short time span (within a few months of each other) as I feel that this is a place that once you experience it, which all of you should, there's not much else to see (no pun intended).  This is not a place I would go to for great food or service as it isn't about that and quite frankly, you won't find either. The waiter hardly visited our table, the food was blah and mediocre (and fairly over priced) and the portions small as my fingers danced around the plate swearing there should be more... I definitely got the wrong app... and I'm sure if I had sent it back, they would have changed it for me no problem, but by the time the waiter came by again, I was thankful I chose to indulge rather than starve as it would have taken far too long to correct this mistake...luckily I'm not a picky eater with no allergies or dietary ristrictions as I can see how messy (again, no pun intended) serving food in the dark can be for an establishment if those involved in plating and serving the food aren't careful.   The concept of dining in the dark is cool, fun and unique which I respect but I do think it takes a certain type of person to enjoy their experience here... it is definitely not for everyone. It was my friend's first time here and although we loved the idea and had a great time experiencing this together, we both agreed that it was a one-time-thing and would likely not return.  A few final thoughts: our reservation name was not on the sheet upon arrival although we called that day and spoke to someone to make it - luckily this wasn't a problem as it was a monday night and they just added it in. 2) My friend ordered a Heineken and we couldn't help but laugh at the hoegarden in his hand once exiting the dark room (shame on him for not being able to tell the difference...) but come on...this has me wondering what else is not what we ordered in that room..... 3) don't come here if you don't want to feel obligated to tip 18% .... groupon doesn't matter as they add the tip to the total of what the bill would have been prior to the discount.. then you are expected to not only tip on that but to tip 18% .... if this is the case, you better make sure your staff deserves it...... they add it to every bill \"at your discretion\" (what is the average person going to do?) And word it in a way so you hardly notice....just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And I'm a server. So I get it. But you're robbing people BLIND (okay, maybe that one was intended). And that is what earned you the 2 star O Noir, auto-grating on a non-existent bill."}
{"text":"Certainly worth checking off the bucket list. It's a unique experience. Mine left me uncomfortable and more sympathetic to those that are severely visually impaired or blind.   Menu is pre selected with limited variety. You pay for the experience not for the food. Portions are good but the quality is mediocre. Spent half of my dinner chasing food around my plate and trying my best to hear my friend that I went with.   Unique experience, glad I did this once. Now onto the next niche."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you've never been here don't get turned off by the bad reviews. If you are someone that's adventurous and like to try new things then you NEED to try this place out. I came here with 5 other friends and 5 of us had so much fun and really tried to relax and enjoy the food. On the other hand one of our friend was just complaining about being scared in the dark whatsoever.  I would say without that friend I would have given the whole experience a 5 star but since it wasn't their fault, I'm giving 5 anyways. Victor was great. It was our first time there and he was very patient with us. I got the main and dessert Filet Mignon (blue rare)- YUM! I was concerned that I might cut myself but turned out they cut it for you. BONUS Surprise dessert- For those of you that haven't tried it before I don't want to spoil it for u but I can say I would rather have the chocolate cake. Prices are reasonable, It's the only dine in the dark restaurant in Toronto! loveitloveitloveit will be back!"}
{"text":"Super fun experience, staff are great but the food (or at least the vegetarian option) was really really bland and not hot enough."}
{"text":"Location: Church and Charles.  I was very excited to visit this place.  It was on my Bucket list.  Staff are friendly and they explained everything to you step by step.  When I was sitting there in the dark, you really appreciate the vision impaired community.   Your other senses are definitely heightened.   I had the Beef surprise (Curry Beef on rice),  Filet Mignon (mashed and green beans) and surprise dessert (Chocolate cake).  They were all delicious and cooked to perfection (I give it a 10).  What caught me off guard was the Filet Mignon was cut for you so you just eat.  Love it.  I strongly recommend this place for a fun and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"The whole point about this restaurant is experience eating in darkness. Dont expect much from food.   Its good for testing your senses while siting in darkness. But even that, vanishes after a while and you would want to leave at your earliest.  Its also expensive: you pay a premium (really) for the experience, not food.  Idea of darkness is good, but only for the first 20-30 mins. No more.  This restaurant is good for experiencing once. But not somewhere you go often."}
{"text":"O'Noir was an awesome dining experience. I have came here twice, both times with a groupon.  After making reservations, we paid for parking for two and a half hours on the streets close by. Two and a half hours were a little tight for both times, I would recommend paying for three hours.  You will be able to choose your meal before hand, appetizer, main and starter. The options were:  Being a little curious of what I was eating, the plating of the food, etc. I was happy to see a waiter carry two plates of food in the dark dining hall before I was seated inside. The dishes are well plated, as well as a restaurant would if you could visually see the meal.  Once we stepped in, it was PITCH BLACK. HOLY MOLEY, I've never seen something as dark as this in my entire life. There was absolutely no sign of light in here. My ears felt extra sharp as I heard other people talking very close to me, my sense of touch was something that was also important, as I had to feel everything in front of me and around me. Approximation was INSANE as you literally had to approximate everything around you. The waiters slash waitresses are amazing at what they do, guiding you through the dark dining room. They carefully explained what I had in front of me based on the direction they were in as I sat down.   I absolutely loved the meals. Feeling a little spontaneous, I decided to go with a surprise main. I was delighted to find out that it was one of their selected items, the shrimp... I literally scraped off my dish to every drop of sauce because I wasn't sure if there was something still inside.  What I phenomenal experience, I would definitely bring some relatives here when they visit."}
{"text":"Went downstairs to restaurant area. You check in and then get a menu to look at and decide what you want to eat. Only one person going around taking orders so it was a bit of a wait until we had ours taken. Then you line up, meet your server then go inside into the dark. Server was Dave and he was really friendly and kind. Inside- tables and chairs seem of somewhat cheaper quality - no tablecloth and you get tissue napkins instead of cloth ones. Big gap between meals as well so our entire meal was 2 hours. We all ordered the three course meal. Mine was surprise vegetarian. Food was cooked well and well seasoned but the quality is average. I'd say for the price it was average but you're paying for the experience here. The experience was worth it. It's hard to eat without seeing what you're eating! Try eating a salad in the dark with a fork! We ended up using one hand and one fork haha anyways it was a neat experience."}
{"text":"I went there almost a year ago.. I think the experience is one of a kind, and anyone should experience it at least once in their lifetime.   Food is definitely only mediocre,and it is overpriced for the quality. Since there are limited choice on food, I think that it should be amazing, but its not. How can you charge people so much, but the food is not at its best quality? I could get better tasting food elsewhere for a cheaper price. If they want customers to come back, they should improve on their food. Or reduce their price. Otherwise, customers will just go there for the experience,and never come back.   The service is good though. Thumbs up for that."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a shot -- eating in the dark seemed really different. They have a cool concept where blind individuals are your servers.. make sure to tell your dates! It was awkward a few times when people didn't know why servers wore sunglasses. When you first walk in, you are greeted by a not so friendly staff who make you wait in a dungeon-like atmosphere until your server is ready. Server was very nice. Food was OK at best. They loaded my plate up with mashed potatoes and there was barely any meat. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I would do this again."}
{"text":"Went to O'Noir for the first time with 8 or my co -workers and their spouses.    What an experience and an amazing time. I did read reviews going into it and was quite skeptical.    There were reviews about the place feeling to dark but guess what people, you're dining in the dark for at least two hours so yeah you'll need your eyes to adjust.    The food was amazing.  I had the Filet Mignon and husband had the shrimp and both were super tasty.  Some of us had the surprise meals and there were no complaints.    The desserts were so lovely and delicious.   I would recommend going as a group as it's a better experience and great for a interactive group social. Keep in mind it is not great for anyone with anxiety, fear of the dark or claustrophobic as it may cause a bit of panic not being able to see.  Other than that it was great.   Loved it and can't wait to go back again.  P.s no one spilled on themselves! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize how expensive this restaurant is! The quality of food wasn't worth the price; it was like something you can get at a food court.  When we got there, we were given menus to order in the lobby before going to the dining area. We were then escorted into the dark by our waiter my holding their shoulder.  I was surprised at the ambiance of the restaurant. The place is underground and the entrance looks like a dungeon lol. The lobby is dark and has a medieval feel. Of course the actual eating area was pitch black so I couldn't comment on the look, but I can feel the tables were wooden and the chairs were the metal banquet chairs.   To begin, we were given bread and butter (the bread was warm and soft with a crispy crust). There was a metal fork and knife (feels cheap) on the right of the table, a polycarbonate plastic cup of cold water on the right, a small ceramic plate with a napkin and a small whipped butter pod on top, in the middle.  The surprise appetizer was calamari! I had four pieces and they were really nice and crispy. It had tartar sauce and some sweet plum-like sauce.  I chose cajun fish as my entree. It was served on a bed of plain rice and boiled beans on the side. The fish was seasoned very generously, crispy crust and soft. Eating in the dark was challenging! I ended up using my hands to eat.  I chose the chocolate mousse as my dessert and it was very decadent and rich. After a few spoons, it was too sweet for me. Lots of layers between mousse and cake.  I felt that we were there for a long time--1.5 hours! There was too much waiting time between each meal. Our seating was 6:30 and was there until 8pm.  The room was also very loud! Most of the time, we had to shout across the table.  The staff was great though, friendly.  Glad we had a Groupon. I was shocked when our bill came to $100 before tax and tip. That entree was not worth $30. Note that even for a table of 2, the minimum tip is 18%.  This is a one-time experience kind of thing; cool to do but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Firstly: Don't go with a Groupon.  Save yourself the surprise of the cost and the hassle when you pay for your meal. It DOES state on the Groupon that you should tip on the actual value of the meal and not the discounted bill, plus you have to pay the tax (but we were so rushed out that I can't tell if it was for the discounted bill or the full price).  In the end, you literally spend 100+ dollars WITH the Groupon, and they show you what your actual bill would have been without the Groupon before tip-- and it's literally the exact same price.  So, literally, all you \"save\" with this deal is what you would have paid for tip on a regular priced meal- so 15 or 20 bucks.  You save 15 or 20 bucks if you go on a Monday-Thursday.  That is the deal. That's what the deal should have been.  Some deals have the \"tax not included\" in their vouchers, but I think they should just do away with it altogether- it's too confusing and it's written so small that so many people miss is and then are blindsided when they arrive at the venue and have to pay the tax.  Some places (like the ROM, concert venues, etc.) don't charge you extra tax when you get there.  What you pay for your Groupon is your ticket in the door. End of story.  ANYWAYS...  Our server, Gavin, was lovely and very accommodating. The food was alright, but definitely not worth 100 dollars for two people.   I had the roasted veggies with goat cheese (yum), filet mignon (cooked perfectly, but too over-peppered by the chef) with veggies and potatoes (meh), and the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream (average). My boyfriend had the mushroom salad (good), filet mignon (too peppery but cooked perfectly) and the fruit sorbet (amazing).  I guess you pay for the experience, but walking in to that dark room hand in hand with your server is a completely individualized experience and everyone deals with it differently.  I'd recommend you test yourself out at home first before paying 100 dollars for this because it could definitely be hard to handle for some!"}
{"text":"I definitely suggest ordering the seafood here. I really enjoyed the O.NOIR Octopus for the starter. Very tender, fresh, and well seasoned. The main of marinated shrimp with herbs and risotto was also very good, there was generous amounts of shrimp, very creamy and flavorful. I didn't order dessert, and got the 2 course package (starter and main dish) for $33. The 3 course package with dessert is $40.  When we first enter the restaurant, there is a waiting area/bar. We were then guided to the actual dining room and to our table by our waiter in the dark. We had to place one hand on each others shoulders so we don't loose each other. When the food was being served, the waiter taped on our shoulder to let us know before putting it on our table. The staff was friendly. However, we had to wait a long time for our food to arrive.   Definitely worthwhile to come here once to experience eating in the dark, and for the seafood!"}
{"text":"I booked to take my daughter here for her birthday for a unique experience. I really did hesitate with the 2 star rating because I think the concept is great and our server, Victor, was amazing too, but at the end of the day they are trying to sell this place as a restaurant.  The appetizers were fine, I had calamari and my wife had the arugula salad.  Unfortunately the main courses were where they really fell flat. My wife had risotto with shrimp and said the risotto was terrible, my daughter and I both had the filet mignon and thought the mashed potatoes were far too runny and overly garlicky too. But the bigger problem was the meat - i took mouth after mouth of fat which when your not able to see what you were eating really made it hard to continue. My son had the penne with red sauce and said it was fine - that might have been the safer choice in hindsight.  As I said, i really didn't want to go 2 stars, but the food quality wound't let me go any higher. Sorry."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a unique concept that I enjoyed up until the middle of eating our mains. But let me back track to the beginning...  We arrived early for our 8:15 pm reservation, there was a washroom for you to use ahead of time so you didn't have to get up during your meal. There were some tables and chairs to let you sit and choose your meal: choice of app + main OR all 3 courses. They also serve alcohol that can be ordered at the bar. After choosing our food, which they are very accommodating when it came to any substitutions which I really like when it comes to trying out new places (\"How accommodating are they to people who request a change in their dishes?\").   Next we then line up and wait in front of the door to lead us in (asked to put any watches that light up/glow away and turn our phones off), we put our hands on each other's shoulders like a train to follow our waiter (Dave) inside. It is completely pitch black, and it was a major adjustment. You have to trust the server to lead you, and it is all part of the experience. After being seated, we are told to feel where our table utensils are and where our water/plates/napkin is. I think the hardest part for me was buttering the bun...I doubt I even put any butter on it. The appetizers we had were the grilled octopus and calamari with tomatoes, and our mains were the steak and the fish with sides. I ditched my fork around the time I was eating my calamari, I would try to get pieces with my fork and try and eat it...only to find nothing. So after ditching my fork I was able to find all the yummy pieces. Besides...not like anyone can see me. I preferred the octopus to my calamari, which just tasted rubbery. My main was the steak- I got it rare. It was so good, and I loved that they cut it up for me already. So eating was a breeze. It was exciting when you feel like you've eaten all your steak then feel around and find more! There was plenty of potato mash left over on all of our plates-good but wish there was more veggies/ green beans (and bigger beans) instead.   There are other people inside this dark room with you...this is where the dining experience started to be uncomfortable for me, as I can only speak for myself not the other people I was with. I think they were a table of maybe 5-6 people(?) who were just absolutely obnoxious, loud and disrespectful to other fellow diners in the room. They felt that they were allowed to swear/use inappropriate language, turning on their phones/turning their watch on and knocking on the walls. It just got super uncomfortable for me, they were goofing off- which is okay because we're all there to have a good time. But the middle of eating our mains I got really fed up when one of us were talking and the room would go silent and it was obvious the other group was listening in on our conversation. Then would make comments on their end that related to what we were talking about. I hate eavesdropping, it's one of my pet peeves. I requested to use the washroom and went outside to speak to the hostess about the other guests. She didn't really care it seemed, she just told one of the girls to make sure they weren't using their phones. I understand it wasn't any of the restaurants fault, and I enjoyed all of the food and experience. It's just a shame that other guests have to be so obnoxious and ruin the experience for others. Our server Dave was awesome, and big ups to him for being so nice and happy. We ended up requesting our dessert to be packed to go, it was just uncomfortable inside due to the room feeling smaller then it probably was.   Good concept, good food, good company and awesome server. Bad fellow dining guests = very uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely a unique experience to try at least once with someone you can talk to and cooperate with!  If you are wondering how dark it is, you can't see your glass when it is at your mouth.  The wait staff get you to hold their shoulder as they lead you to your table. Your food will be passed to you at shoulder height so you can put it down in front of you. I recommend putting your drinks to one side of the table so you know where it is and have less chances of dropping it.  I had the grilled octopus appetizer and it was really good! I was worried after ordering the filet mignon but luckily it was already cut into bite size pieces.  Note, make sure your hands are clean. Touching your food and plate may be necessary to find your food and see if you are done."}
{"text":"Ordered a surprise starter (which seemed to be just a salad), filet mignon (DELICIOUS!) and surprise dessert (seems like my friend got something different from me). A unique and interesting experience that everyone should try at least once. Our waiter Gavin was awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh no it just wasn't good. Our server, Michael, was great. Everything else though... not so much. The quality of the food was my main issue. I got the pasta and it was hot in some places, cold in others. It had no flavour and really needed to be seasoned. The person I was with had the steak and made the same complaint - hot in some spots, cold in others.  Being in the dark was interesting, a completely different experience that you won't get anywhere else, but here I felt like it was used more as a gimmick. The food should be EXTRA good if you can't see it and unfortunately that just wasn't the case. I would have given this place 1 star but bumped it to 2 for the atmosphere and our amazing server."}
{"text":"Food was good; wait was not  We had surprise meat and filet mignon and surprise seafood. Surprise seafood was good. It's okay but the dessert was okay we had the dark chocolate mousse and the fruit sorbet overall it tasted very good the atmosphere was very different and special it felt like it was an adventure and the problem though is that we had to wait too long for the food"}
{"text":"Super cool experience in which I learned it is easier to eat cheesecake than salad when blind. Would highly recommend it! Gavin, my waiter was fabulous - gentle, funny. A truly humbling experience. The seafood starter was not my fav but the filet was delicious. Skip the lemon drop martini - it wasn't very lemony."}
{"text":"It is pricey for what you get.   The quality of the food is just not there for the price you pay. For starters I chosen the surprise seafood, and receieved 3 breaded shrimp. For the main course the filet mignon was not cooked correctly (asked for med rare) lots of potato and broccoli. For dessert the sorbet, tasted like store bought tub of ice cream with canned fruit.   The biggest upset was that we were seated before the couple beside us and they were served way before us and finished their dinner when we were still waiting for our main course. Even our drinks came after theirs..  It is obviously impossible to wave the waiter down to settle these issues and we were also forced to tip 20%."}
{"text":"Surprise menu spoiler alert  To start off, our server was very nice and checked up on us a few times. As well, the experience was very new and interesting. However, we had an issue with the food.   Although I loved my choice of octopus, steak and chocolate cake, the surprise menu was quite disappointing. My boyfriend ended up getting an Asian inspired salad (which was alright, but quite plain), what I assume to be risotto and vegetables as well as a cheesecake. When we asked what the surprise menu was, it turns out that it was supposed to be duck- but there was none on the plate. I guess the downside is that you can't complain about your dish if you don't know what it is. When we asked about the mixup, the dish he received wasn't the vegetarian option either. So at the end of the day, we didn't receive a discount for the disappointing mixup in his main, and was \"highly suggested\" to tip 18% which I wouldn't mind because the waiter was great, but the food was quite lacking on the surprise menu part."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here for dinner.  I ordered the filet mignon that came with vegetables and potatoes.  To my surprise the steak was actually good and moist.  The potatoes were in big chunks.  I thought it would be difficult to eat in the dark but I did fine.  I didn't stab my self or anyone.  It was nice to enjoy each others company with out cell phone distractions.    I would definitely recommend this place to others.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"When deciding where to go to Valentine's Day dinner, we decided to try something a little different and have an \"experience\" , instead of just dinner. So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh.   One recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself.   THE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table.   And it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room.   You are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap.   This is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food.   I would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know!   Finally, it's very expensive!   I found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite. Once is enough for me!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience there, I ordered the vegetarian pasta and it was amazing. The service was very good. I talk about this restaurant all the time with my friends and family telling them they must try it out!   Not only do you get to experience something different but it also makes you realize how important it is to be thankful for your vision."}
{"text":"I just dined here tonight and I was so unimpressed with the experience that I had to write a review - my first.  SERVICE: 1/5 Our server forgot about us after the appetizer. We waited at least 30 minutes before someone overheard me ask my partner where our food was. At that point, the table next to us was already onto dessert. I guess one of the waiters overheard me and tapped my arm asking what I had ordered. We repeated our order to him; my order came correctly, however, my partner's didn't. I asked why the service was so slow and where our original waiter was. Our waiter replies, \"Have you not been to a restaurant before? This is not a fast food joint. It's a full house tonight.\"  1) our server was straight out rude 2) this was slower than any fine dining restaurant i've been to and it was clear that we were forgotten (had i not said anything, we would have been sitting there in the dark for who knows how long, we had to repeat our order and the food was cold) 3) no need to get defensive - poor customer service skills on his part and 4) if you can't handle a full house, don't seat so many people - it looks like it's affected the quality of service.  We didn't even know how to get our server's attention, he was never around.  FOOD: 1/5 There is nothing that shouts fine dining. I ordered the calamari and my partner ordered the octopus for an appetizer. They tasted exactly the same - hard and burnt. Dining in the dark heightens other senses and it definitely did just that. For the main I had the the risotto with shrimp. It was cold. Probably because we were forgotten. I had maybe 2 tablespoons of risotto on my plate which to be fair tasted decent - but I couldn't help but think they scraped whatever was left in the bottom of the pot since the kitchen probably thought they've served everyone their main.The shrimp was terrible. It was salty and 'mushy'. I also had some strange meat in the dish, I couldn't tell what it was. My partner had the surprise and did not even know what he was eating. He asked the waiter after it was served to him and the waiter responded with, \"well then it wouldn't be a surprise.\" What if someone had food allergies, he could have atleast asked if we did. And since we couldn't make out what we were eating in this surprise dish, that just tells you something.   EXPERIENCE: 3/5 It was definitely a different experience dining in the dark and something worth trying but I would not recommend you do it here. Calling themselves a fine dining restaurant is stretching it. You'd think at least the food or the service would be good but unfortunately neither turned out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited O'Noir a few weeks ago. This is an establishment that relies primarily on its gimmick for business. The food, while adequate, was nothing amazing. And the service wasn't particularly great either.  On the plus side, it was a very unique dining experience. The room is completely pitch black, even after my eyes had adjusted I still wasn't able to make out any details whatsoever. It was fun trying to eat food that you couldn't see.  Be aware the restaurant can get very noisy. The beginning of our dining experience was much nicer, with everyone talking in hushed whispers. But it wasn't long before a college crowd came in and everyone was yelling and shouting and it was difficult to carry on a conversation. It made for a rather unpleasant experience, although I suppose it's not something O'Noir's has any control over.  Overall it was an OK experience, but I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Everybody should do this at least once in their life.  They only do two servings a day and they are usually full, definitely reserve your spot before going.  TIPS: - Make sure you go with a person you are comfortable with because you can't see them at all (no body language)  - Contrary to popular belief, you eyes dont get adjusted, it is PITCH BLACK. Cant even make out a shape in the darkness.  Experience(5/5): This should definitely be on everybody's bucket list. I think this is more of an empathy exercise than anything else. You arrive there and check in, the they take your order under the light.  Then you are lead by your server to the room you will be eating in, you would put a hand on his/her shoulder and he will guide you through the the dark room.  Your other senses become more sharp, you would be able to hear a lot more than you usually would. *Guilty Confession* we were able to listen to three different conversations from different tables at the same time, we were just checking how sharp our hearing senses had become.  FOOD (4/5): Filet mignon was good, tender and juicy. However, i didn't quite like the \"Vegetables\" that came with it, it was just one type of veggie, i was expecting more variety.  The steak was already cut which made it easier to eat, it would have been a mission cutting the steak in complete darkness."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly, and it's an exciting experience. It helps you disconnect and engage with who you're with and gives you a great appreciation for someone who isn't able to see.  Food isn't too bad, calamari wasn't bad. The shrimp is a bit spicy, but they are a good size and they give you 5 or 6 for the entree. It comes with risotto which I found a bit bland, but it helps with the spice from the shrimp and veggies.   Overall the food isn't amazing, it's not bad though. It's just the experience that I will remember. Everyone should experience this at least once in their life!"}
{"text":"We made reservations here before and came in on a pretty slow? time. The dining area we were showed in had only me and my hubby and another couple who came in after.  The experience all together was very unique indeed, its nice to eat in the dark and not have to be picky about whats on my plate for once, lol. Our server was really, really nice and she was quick to serve us in whatever we requested. As for the food? it was okay, nothing amazing from what I tasted but I guess it depends on what you order I guess.   I would go back here if I wanted to show a friend/family another kind of dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is all about the experience, not necessarily a culinary one. Where else can you eat in pitch-black darkness?  Located on the southwest corner of Church and Charles, much of O NOir is located underground.  The dim, old fashion decor sets the mood for this place.  As a surprise, the waiters/ waitresses are blind. Price ranges from $32-$38 depending if you want either appetizer or dessert with your meal. You can choose what to eat prior to entering the dark atmosphere, or you can request their \"surprise dishes\". For starters I chose to have their grilled octopus, which was nicely charred, and was not as flavorful, It would have made a difference with a squeeze of lemon to be honest.. 3/5 Entree was a surprise: I ended up having their Veal (already pre-cut) served with potatoes and veggies in a marsala sauce: 3/5  tasted pretty generic, and the meat was bland, would have prefferred to have it more seasoned. Dessert: was a surprise, their chocolate mouse cake, rich, creamy, and huge! that was definitely a great way to end it off 4/5.  Would i come here again, probably not, but I would recommend everyone to try this place once."}
{"text":"This place isn't about the food, it's honestly about the experience. You pick your food items and look at the menu before you enter into the dark rooms. It's completely pitch black inside, so it does feel very claustrophobic and personally, I wouldn't recommend it for young children or seniors either, since it can be quite an adjustment. Your senses definitely heighten inside the darkened room and you pay much more attention to what you eat and who you eat with since those are the two things you know for sure. It's quite fun trying to figure out all the elements on your plate and eat it without making a mess, but otherwise, the food itself isn't that mind-blowing, and quite simple dishes to be honest."}
{"text":"First of all. I have soooo much respect for who ever came up with this idea. This place is all about EXPERIENCE. Dont be picky about the food. Its not WOW but its just fine. Go there for one of the most unbelievable experience in your life time. You will appreciate it."}
{"text":"I had once heard of a restaurant concept where you dine in complete darkness. But I had no idea until a friend told me that such a experience could be had here in Toronto. Hence, O.Noir. It is indeed an interesting and unique concept for the uninitiated. I'd highly recommend making a reservation, since there are two scheduled dinner service hours each night. Don't fess too much about what to wear, because who cares what you're wearing when you're eating in the dark (and you might get food on your shirt).  Upon arrival, you place your order beforehand, and you're also free to have a drink at their dated circa-1970s bar (which thankfully is lit). Then your blind server will call your party, introduce oneself by name, and lead you into the dining hall, seating you each of you individually and giving you clear instructions on what to do and to expect.  Indeed it is pitch-dark inside--like, there's not even a lit EXIT sign in sight. \"Awesome decor,\" indeed. My dining buddy admits to feeling freaked out and claustrophobic at first, but adjusted well to the scenario after a few minutes of chatter and a drink. I kept my cool. Your server will bring your meal and it's up to you to figure out if it is what you ordered and how or if to use utensils in the dark.  Our server was very accommodating. But service within the whole establishment generally is slow. You wait forever between courses. I wonder if they intentionally structure the timing of the meal to make it easier for the servers to do their jobs, since it seems like most other diners got their entrees or whatever at around the same time.  The food overall was quite enjoyable and filling, but not extraordinarily great. My dining partner thought everything in his mouth was wonderful. But I thought the food within our dining context and for the price left a lot to be desired. Notwithstanding other people's comments on the food quality, I'd thought they'd be full of imagination and put a lot of emphasis on being creative with exploring taste. Sure why not, since in the absence of light one cannot \"eat with their eyes\"--for I can care, the dishes could look like fresh dog crap (and of course I wouldn't know it) but taste like heaven (probably a bad example, but the 'Iron Chef' episode of Futurama comes to mind). But nope. The menu, which is prix-fixe, is very small, but also includes the option of a surprise course (I had a surprise desert).  O.Noir is a very fun and novel, unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience worth checking out nonetheless, even in its gimmicky-ness, and may leave you having a bit more respect for the visually impaired (even for someone like myself whose lifelong extreme nearsightedness scares a lot of friends). But as a restaurant concept, O.Noir is certainly a culinary opportunity that hasn't been exploited well.  {Located on SW corner Church and Charles St, below-grade entrance. TTC: a short walk on Church from Wellesley subway station... or an even shorter walk from Bloor/Yonge station.}"}
{"text":"This was a fun experience.. although sitting in the dark gets old pretty quickly.  I expected that the food was going to be amazing but it was just ok, nothing fabulous.   For the price we paid I expected higher end cuisine. They say you eat with your eyes and I now wonder if not having the visual of the food was part of the food tasting a bit bland for me!?! It's an interesting experience to eat in complete darkness wondering what the room looks like or what your food looks like. At some point most people end up eating with their hands. (You can't see where or what's on your plate)."}
{"text":"Experience - 5 Food 3.5 Overall 4  The experience is like no other as you dine in pitch black.  You can't see your hand in front of your face!  So it really gives you an eye opening (pun intended!) sensory overload experience.  If you have bad coordination skills this may not be the best idea for you, but other than that once you get used to where things are on the table you will be fine.  Only one spilled drink at our table!  Went here with a large group - about 50 people and we all did the price-fix menu - 3 dishes for $40.  I had the arugula salad with mushrooms, Parmesan cheese with some oil/lemon dressing.  I appreciated the fact that the dressing was light - nothing more annoying when the salad is swimming in pounds and pounds of dressing.  GROSS.  I chose the shrimp with risotto.  I did this because I thought it would be easy for me to stab the shrimp and get some food into my mouth...and the risotto because I like a challenge!  The risotto was pretty nice but I didn't care much for the shrimp.  I did the surprise dessert and it was a brownie cheesecake (the server told us there are 4 different variations of the cheesecake so everyone might get different ones).  It was funny because I kept saying it tasted like chocolate while the person next to me kept saying it tasted like cherries (because that is the one she got but we didn't know at the time there were varieties...lol).  Overall I do think this is an experience that you should definitely try.  I wouldn't keep going back as the food is decent but nothing to right home about.  But I am glad that I did it and I impressed myself with actually getting food in my mouth :)"}
{"text":"This review is really a 5/5. Only 4/5 for the price, but everything else was more than amazing.  I'm going to be like everybody else and say that the concept is great, it's a lot of fun, and the food tasted good, just a little more on the pricey side (ended up being $90 for both me and my boyfriend (each a starter, entrée, and dessert).  It's completely true though! Although I want to rave on about the food (which I will later), the concept of this place is great. I can't say the hostesses were too friendly... but the servers completely make up for it (maybe the hostesses are intentionally bad so we seem like we get a better experience with our servers...?) Our server Dave was friendly and had a nice charm to him. We had to conga-line it inside the dining area where it is literally PITCH DARK. You literally can't see ANYTHING at all and its weird at first but you get used to it. You can do anything in the dark and no one can see you, including shoving a piece of your meal accidentally into your nose because it was a bigger portion than you expected (not that I did that...).  Anyhoo, the food was also splendid.   Appetizers: My boyfriend got the calamari and I got the Portobello mushroom salad for our appetizers. They were flavorful and did not disappoint.  Mains: For the main course it was filet mignon and the chicken. The filet mignon tasted sooooooooooooo good. The chicken as well was in a larger portion than I expected to be. Every time I thought I was done eating all the chicken, I seemed to always find another piece stabbed on my fork.   Desserts: Cake & icecream and Chocolate mousse. I didn't get a chance to try the cake & icecream, BUT NO REGRETS. I WOULD EAT 10 OF MY CHOCOLATE MOUSSES. Maybe it's because I'm a girl and chocolate is my one true love, but the dark chocolate mousse is one of my favourite desserts, even after eating at Canoe. It was rich and creamy and just oh-so chocolatey.  All in all it was an amazing experience. It's definitely a place to bring someone special. Or someone who loves chocolate."}
{"text":"The overall experience of total darkness is great, as was the server, but the food quality isn't good (my main tasted like Minute Rice and VH Sauce, unfortunately), the bathroom stalls in the women's room have no sanitary disposal, so there were used feminine products strewn on the floor.   When I wrote a professional and respectful email to the management about my concerns, they were completely unapologetic (and didn't articulate that the rice was not parboiled and that it was not VH Sauce), and didn't seem to understand how females need to dispose of used sanitary products while still in the privacy and hygiene of the stalls.    I will not be going back. It's really too bad, because it's otherwise such a smart restaurant idea and has the potential to be an excellent experience overall. If you're just going for the total darkness experience, give it a try and go for it, but buyer beware."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to o'noir however we found a deal on groupon. The first experience was great we loved it which is why we were so thrilled to get a great deal to go there. This trip however was awful. To begin the room was so packed and the people inside were so loud that you could barely hear the person sitting across from you. That was a small detail we got our appetizers after waiting what seemed a while and they were pretty good. So by this point we were on track, the problems started after we waited what seemed forever for our meal. During the waiting period I accidentally knocked over my coke. I called out to our waiter for extra napkins but nobody came. We waited for at least 5 mins with coke everywhere before someone actually came by. When we finally got our food i had ordered a surprise meal. I got duck with mashed potatoes and green beans. The duck had a very unfortunately thick layer of fat around each piece of meat that they had cut for you. It was not a pleasurable eating experience especially as you could not see, but tolerable. My boyfriend had ordered a veggie fried rice and his meal was AWFUL , for starters he went to eat it and his food was so sticky and gooey that it coated his fork. When he put it in his mouth the \"rice\" was like mush as if it was over cooked but the ends were hard like it wasn't cooked enough. We finally decided we were going to send it back when we found out from the waiter that it was risotto because they had run out of rice.... it was nice of them to tell us after we complained.... I loved the dark atmosphere but the wait, the loudness of the other dining guests just did not make a pleasurable experience and as a result I can't say that we will be going back."}
{"text":"food here is pretty awful. the only reason to go is for the experience of eating in complete darkness. If you are on your second or third date with someone it might be fun to go, but I don't see any other reason to come here."}
{"text":"Was a bit apprehensive at first.  Our server Brandon was very friendly and sat us at our table. It was pitch black.  Hearing was the main sense I noticed with smell a close second.  I had the grilled shrimp. It was awesome.  Suzy had the filet mignon and it was so tender it cut with the fork. A must visit whenever in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm terrified of the dark and it took me a long time to adjust, but it was okay after.  This is a very interesting concept and I love that servers are visually impaired.  When I first walked into the place I didn't like how dim it was in the hallways and lounge area, but it really made sense once you left (it was to make it easier for your eyes to adjust).  The food was better than I thought.  Based on the reviews I was expecting it to be garbage.  It wasn't exceptional, but it was pretty tasty.  The portions (from what I could tell) were quite large too.  I had the salad, shrimp with risotto and beans, and the fruit sorbet.  The one complaint about the food was that the risotto wasn't really creamy, it was a bit dry.    The negative things I have to say should come with a DISCLAIMER.  I was attended the restaurant for a charity event, so the comments on service may not apply on a regular night.  I found the service to be incredibly slow.  We were supposed to eat at 7pm, but they didn't even start seating people until after 8pm.  After that you still had to wait for everyone to be seating before they would start serving you.    I thought it was pretty disorganized.  You walk in and have no idea where you're going.  No one was at coat check.  And good thing I looked at the menu online beforehand, because the \"menu\" in the lounge where you pick  your food simply said:  \"beef, shrimp, pasta, chicken\" on a white piece of paper.  You had no idea what they came with or how they were cooked.  You were supposed to tell someone what you were going to be ordering.  That was very unclear, however, and no one was walking around trying to take orders until 7pm when we were supposed to be seated.      If you read the review or get tips from people who have been already, I found that the \"surprise\" dishes are always the same.  So there's no real surprise there.  It was VERY loud in them.    All of those negatives being said, I would absolutely recommend this place to try to try at least once!"}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying I never leave reviews and I am never one to complain BUT this place WOW-SO BAD.  This place is a complete gimmick serving cafeteria food. I cannot believe the price you pay for such sub par food. The calamari was burnt and cold. 1.5 hours later the main comes and it was completely cold. I had the filet and it was maybe 3 ounces?.  Quality of meat was similar to what you find in a subway steak sandwich. The wait time to eat was atrocious, you don't make people wait 2 hours to eat, I was on my 4th beer by the time the main came and that is literally the first time I have ever had so many beers before eating out. Went to the bathroom because I couldn't wait any longer and got to see the food coming out.... WOW, owner and management should be ashamed of themselves, whoever owns this place does not care whatsoever about food and it is extremely evident in the dishes that were coming out of the kitchen. Also the cutlery, napkins, dishes were all REALLY cheap. The bathrooms were old and dirty. If your gonna charge 26 dollars a plate for half a portion of food at least spend a bit of money on your restaurant.    To top it all off we were in a rush because we had other engagements that night so we got our desserts to go(after 2+ hours in the dark). Big line that takes forever to pay and you get some rude young guy as well who could not split our bill properly. Also I was charged for 9 beers when I had 4 ,but because we didn't have time and the incredibly rude child with the blonde hair taking people's payment wouldn't listen we ended up just paying this ridiculous bill with an extra 5 beers and for a cafeteria quality meal .... that was cold. Lol!      The one benefit me and my girlfriend and friends enjoyed about this experience is that we got to have the absolute worst dining experience together and we will never forget it! Thanks o noir     Oh and last thing, the guy responding to negative reviews. You sound exactly like the reason there is a problem with your restaurant, sounds so odd to see someone just disagree with someone's experience every time . You should just listen and improve the problems people are having instead of saying \"most people like our stuff\"- no they don't , it's impossible. Your food is TERRIBLE. The service is atrocious and the price is just laughable ."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon deal and it was about $10 cheaper if we didn't get one. The total cost, with one ice tea was $94 (with the Groupon already) Was it worth it? Yes!   It's worth the experience. Everything inside was pitch black. I've never been in a room that's completely blacked out. I felt like my hearing was heightened and more sensitive to everything else. Eating was a lot harder and I now have a better appreciation on seeing my plate.   We were walked in to our seats. Our server was pleasant, checked in on us maybe once or twice. The entire time, my friend and I were just laughing and cracking jokes, which made it fun for us. I feel without the distraction of the phone (you  have to turn it off) , the meal was more pleasant.   Upon breezing through the bad reviews, I felt sorry for those who got a bad plate. We loved ours. It was prepared so well. I got the shrimp with risotto, with veggies. The risotto had a consistency of rice... Like eating a bowl of good rice... not sure if risottos are supposed to be like that (my first time). The shrimp was seasoned well... One the best I've ever had. The chocolate dessert that I got was also pretty good. It was supposed to have ice cream, but they didn't have any. We like that the portions were generous, we were stuffed by the end of the night.   My friend got \"surprise\" appetizer and dessert. It was fun trying to figure out what it was. I wish they told us at the end of the night.   Would we do it again? No. Towards the end of the night, I was getting tired of putting an empty fork in my mouth. It's the novelty that's fun. But since I got that out of my system, I can now move on to other things.    I highly suggest for every foodie to at least try. It is pricey, but it's pretty much like going to a higher end steak house. It's worth the food and the concept that you pay for."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dining experience I've ever had. The pitch black room, the friendly staff, the delicious food, all of it were amazing. I highly recommend going with friends who like food and can appreciate the logistical nightmare it must be to make this restaurant work.  Waiters ask your name, lead you in by holding onto their shoulder and generally are attentive.  While the food isn't top of the line gourmet, it is fun and delicious and an excuse to eat with your fingers and lick the plates.   Just wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is a place to get the experience. To be completely out in a situation where you have one of your senses taken away, makes us realize how much, we can still do without it.  We ordered in the lobby area, and were led in by the waitress, and she helped us to our seats too.  We had gone with the groupon deal.  We had the three course dinner, and everything came promptly.  I had the octopus appetizer, the fish entree and the chocolate cake. All very delicious and their portion sizes were good too.  It is definitely an experience to try once."}
{"text":"If you want the best meal of your life this isn't the place....and you'd be missing the point if that's what you were looking for.....but....THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  I went on a second date with someone that was by far one of the most scary, hilarious, cool experiences and definitely made for a funny story to tell my friends for days after. Don't let any negative reviews sway you- just go..with friends, with a boyfriend, or on a casual date! It made for a totally cool way to get to know someone. I'll definitely go back with friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Have heard of this place for long time and finally decided to try it with coupon. We ordered grilled octopus and calamari as starters. It was cooked dry and calamari wasn't tasted like calamari at all. It was like the dry liver. Main course were mignon and salmon. Mignon was just ok. My bf said his salmon was quite little. The dessert was the only thing pleased us. Then more problem came up when we tried to pay with coupon. The cashier wrote down many numbers and tried to explained why it was a big number (like a normal meal price in common restaurant) even though we already paid for the coupon. I understood that coupon is excluding tax so we still need to pay tax and tips. My bf and I both work with numbers everyday but we can't understand how they calculated to charge us another big amount besides coupon. The cashier in the end even  told us this was how she was taught to calculate it. Since there were other guests waiting to pay, we just paid whatever the number they showed to us. So in total of coupon and amount charged at the restaurant we paid over hundred bucks (quite similar or maybe even more than the normal price if we went there without coupon?!) and we were still hungry afterwards and had to eat something else. I'm not gonna recommend to my friends this restaurant even though the experience of dining in dark is kinda unique."}
{"text":"Is it better in the dark? Well, no, it isn't. I like to see what I am eating. Sight is part of the eating experience, and I enjoy using all my senses while eating. Regardless, was invited to come here for a dinner, so I decided to join in.  Don't come for the food, at the price, you would expect some better quality food. Here is what I got. App: Was some oversized potatoes, and some salad. Very plain and unappealing. Potatoes weren't cut up either, so I was eating it like a apple basically.  Main: Filet Minion. With the amount of marbling and fat in the meat, this was definitely not a filet. This was most likely a top sirloin. Meat was cut into chunks, so you wouldn't need to use a knife.  Dessert: Random pieces of cheesecake. As I was reading in other posts, the manager was saying the desserts were bought and not made fresh on site. I am not a fan of that. I want to get fresh food when I am paying for it in a restaurant.  Overall, I wasn't impressed. I was hoping for an experience where the food was a bit more mysterious. If I order surprise, I don't want to be able to guess it within seconds. Also, the same experience could be made by wearing a blind fold while you eat. I wouldn't pay a premium to eat at this place over a better restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night; we had made reservations for the 8:30PM sitting.  I was a touch nervous at first about what the experience would be like, but it ended up being quite enjoyable.  Upon arrival, guests are provided with a menu in a lit area and you select what you want to eat then.  When they are ready, they call you to the door of the room in which you will be eating and the server comes out to meet you and introduce him/herself.  We had Elias, who was great.  You are then led into the room, and seated.  The room is completely dark, and your eyes do not adjust at all.  My husband and I both enjoyed the food very much.  I had the grilled portobello mushroom over greens as an appetizer, and my husband has the octopus.  For the main, I had the filet mignon, and my husband had the shrimp over risotto.  And my husband had the chocolate mousse for dessert.  I did find it challenging to eat  my salad greens in the dark, it was hard to tell if I was actually capturing anything with my fork.  But the good  news when it came to the steak is that they do cut it up for you in advance.  (Which is an especially good thing since I lost my knife along with my napkin to the floor part-way through the meal!)  All in all, definitely worth trying once.  Dining in complete darkness wasn't quite as challenging as I thought it would be; it's amazing how intuitive eating a meal is.  An enjoyable experience overall."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5.  Came here on a Groupon deal with a friend of mine who's came before and was nervous from the dark experience, but was willing (sort of :P) to come with me again (thanks!). Totally my first time.  I had an alright time. I felt like my expectations were too high however so I will take some responsibility for what I expected and what I actually experienced. I thought the decor in the \"foyer\" area was interesting and it looked nice. The hostess and the servers were nice. I ordered a beer, the octopus appetizer, the shrimp risotto and a surprise dessert which you order beforehand (obviously). In we went into the darkness.  The dining room area felt small however it could just be that since our sight was out of commission that people normally speak more loudly and our ears are more sensitive but the sound in the room was very loud and people felt quite close to us. Feeling around the table we could find our napkin, small plate, fork/knife and a small butter. I'm not sure what it was but maybe since I was trying so hard to see things it put strain on my eyes and gave me a slight headache. It didn't go away until we left and temporarily went away when our food came which distracted me.  We were served with a glass of water and a small, fresh dinner roll shortly after, then came our beer and then finally our appetizers. Once I picked up my fork I already gave up and started to use my left hand to feel around for my food. My octopus were cut into small pieces and it felt like it was placed over a few leaves of arugula with a balsamic/olive oil vinaigrette. I thought it was quite tasty and had fun trying to find if I had any food left on my plate. After our plates were collected, it felt like forever waiting for our entrees. A bunch of tables surrounding out sounded like they had their entrees already even though we were one of the first tables to be seated that night. We figured it might have been because my friend ordered the fish which was fried very nicely and it was hot however my food was left a bit cold unfortunately. Not only were my shrimp cold but my risotto didn't really have the same creamy texture I was expecting out of it. I was a little disappointed in that but my shrimp were big and would've been tastier if it came out hot. Lastly, I got my surprise dessert where I don't know if I should describe or not to \"keep the surprise\" for people. I mean... shouldn't they change the dessert every once in a while? Or the menu for that matter. My friend went to Onoir last year and the menu hadn't changed since then. Maybe that's something the restaurant should change? Anyways the dessert was alright. My friend had the chocolate cake and ice cream which I liked better (somehow we managed to share a little with each other).   Overall, an ok experience. I think it's overpriced but people say it's for the experience. I guess at least I can say I've tried it."}
{"text":"In the Dark but Seeing Red.  The concept was novel for about 15 minutes.  The food was like soggy cardboard and could only have come from the freezer (Michelina was comparatively high-end!).  And then they had the gall to charge chef's rates.  In summary, the food was terrible, the experience was mediocre, and the prices were criminal.  That said, I appreciate the fact that they hire blind service staff who obviously face greater employment obstacles than others.  But this place is NOT built for repeat customers - O. Noir is a gimmick which I expect will burn out as soon as enough people have been to spread the word."}
{"text":"Save your money! If you want to experience Onoir, warm up a microwaveable dinner and turn off the lights. Voila! The food is disgusting. Our server, Dave was absolutely amazing but the staff in the bar area were awful. They were rude, confrontational, and their overall bitchy attitudes made our group quite uncomfortable.  I left hungry and upset because I felt ripped off. Not to mention the uncomfortable steel chairs, plastic cups and the bathrooms were very dark, dingy and in need of serious renos.  Just awful, awful, awful."}
{"text":"This place was very exciting, something fun and new. I felt an excited suspense all around me. Wondering what the \"surprise dish\" might be, and picturing what the inside might look like.  The food suffered from the artifact of old age that was seeping out from the decor.  Surprise! Sliced, broiled, chicken breast in gravy, served with fully cooked yet firm potato, and green beans.  I wish this place had a better menu, it would have made the whole experience 4 star, easily."}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon with my girlfriend. You place your order before hand in a dimly lit waiting room. Then you are introduced to your waiter and he guides you in through a buffer room closing the door behind before opening the one in front to the actual dining area. So you really have no clue what the dining room looks like. The waiter sits you down, brings water and bread and leaves you to feel out your place mat while you wait for the food.  The experience really is quite interesting. There's very little opportunity in life to just sit there blind trying to eat your food. I tried to copy what I've noticed visually impaired people do while eating; had an imaginary location for all of my things. Fork on this side, knife here, cup right above on the left. The food itself was pretty good. Although I want to say some of it was a little burnt, but I'll never know as I couldnt see to confirm. The meal took much longer than usual, both to eat and for plates to come and go. I really enjoyed the experience, but not sure if I'll need to come again any time soon."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  Went with a group of 9 - thought it was going to be utterly chaotic - it wasn't in the least.  The food was awesome. I had the portobello starter & the filet for my main - both were absolutely delicious. The filet was cooked to perfection!  Our server Dave was astounding - thanks for the fantastic service Dave!!  All in all, it is a must try. Eating in pitch dark - so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face - is an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"O Noir was Okay, that is honestly all I can say. Nothing memorable except I remembered waiting so long for the next course to arrive.   We arrived on time for our reservation but they made us wait for 20 minutes in the lounge area, the host was rather rude. She didn't call me by my name when it was our time to enter the dining area, instead she said \"hey, come here (with her hands waving)\" how rude.  I was a little terrified going in, but once we were seated it was fine.   We got a 3 course meal deal through Groupon and that was great due to the fact that it's over priced. My boyfriend did the surprise dish on all three courses and i did a surprise dish on the appetizer and dessert. the appetizer was a salad and it really tasted plain. I ordered the steak for my main course and my boyfriend had pork. My steak was cooked medium and it was not bad but nothing special and it came with green beans and potatoes. My boyfriend's main entree was pretty good too and the side dishes that came with it was the same as mine.  We both got a chocolate turtle cheesecake which was pretty good.  After we were done, we were escorted out of the dining room and waited to pay, that was it.   In total our dining experience took 2 and a half hours, nothing special, just starving"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews prepared me for a few things - sub-par food, priciness, small portion, slow service, gimmicky experience, loud, grungy. So imagine my surprise when I totally loved my first experience at O'Noir. Sure, it's my first and maybe I'll be a lot more critical during my second - there will be a second! Let's dig into the deets.   Customer Service: The ladies at the main bar are non-smiling but were courteous. We were led in by a gentleman named Nasir. And he was really nice. Spoke clearly, checked in on us, attended to us, and was speedy with the food and water, even though it seemed like he was the only server in the room (we could hear him talking to others). Our server also had a sense of humor, which was nice. My friends were plotting to leave me behind in the dark, and he was like \"You want to leave her behind? Okay!!\" And the people around started laughing. It was cute.  Experience: I didn't find it gimmicky. I didn't find it loud - most likely because we went on a weekday. At first I was nervous, but then I quite enjoyed this pitch dark dining experience. It's definitely something different. Definitely a \"must do\" if you haven't already. And this is a rave place for blind speed dating!!  Food: I don't get all the complaints about the food. Sure it's not The Keg, but it isn't bad by any means (and trust me, I've had both good and bad steak in my life). I ordered an Appetizer and Main Course - Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Parmigiano and Balsamic Vinegar on a Mixed Green Salad, and the O'Noir Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables. Both were well-sized portions, absolutely delcious and I was super full after. I did have to poke around and use my hands, but it was all a part of the dining experience. My friends ordered the Goat Cheese appetizer and the Calamari and they raved about both. The calamari is grilled and mushy, so please do not expect fried rings. They both ordered the chicken dish for their main course and from what I hear, yummilicious. The food isn't piping hot, but I wouldn't say it's cold either. It was warm-ish. Some people like their food hot; I don't, so it didn't bother me much.  Ambience: You don't see anything once you're in the room, so by all means, it could be a hole in the wall. But the outsides aren't grungy; in fact, the place had a nice old, classy feel to it that I enjoyed.   Price: The steak I ordered would cost atleast $30+ at a moderately priced place like Canyon Creek. So, I am not sure why people are deeming O'Noir's price fixe menu pricey. I think it's priced right; if it was any less, this place would be a STEAL! Also, they didn't add an 18% gratuity to our bill; maybe they don't do that anymore? Don't fret, I tipped!!   Verdict? I want to come back here with my boyfriend!! And I'm hoping the novelty won't wear off and I'll still feel the anxiety walking in. It's quite the experience."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review! If they'd improve the food and get rid of the mildew smell, It'd be 4 stars or better.  For $32, the only thing edible was the steak and the starter salad, but you know what? To dine in the dark, to help employ people with a disability, to know that 5% of your dinner profits go to charity? I think its worth it.   Here's my long review:  It's very cool being in 100% darkness. Only twice did I accidentally put my hand into the food. Unlike most others, I used my fork and I did a good job clearing my plate. It was also fun was attempting to \"cheer\" with our wine glasses. Our server, Diana, did a great job. She asked us if we were ready for our mains and gave us extra time when we weren't. Brought us extra napkins and asked the table next to us to try to keep it down a bit. Great server.  Negatives: the lighted bar area is pleasant, but inside the restaurant you are instantly hit with the smell of mildew. But where we sat it didn't smell as strongly and I was able to ignore it.  It's very noisy inside when there's a big group. Also, some people don't turn their cellphones off (despite 3-5 requests). Please do this! It's very annoying to see someone's cellphone flashing across the room.   The food: I recommend the steak and a salad (maybe ask for \"light\" dressing.) I had the Octopus to start and it was so disgusting that I was going to send it back. It was the bartender's recommendation, too! My friend, who is far too polite, traded me for his surprise starter, which wasn't bad. Just some marinated roasted red peppers and cherry tomatoes, arugula and a balsamic vinigrette. For the main, I had the steak, which was really tender and nicely seasoned. It's supposed to come with potatoes and veggies. Since reviewers said they were awful, I asked for the risotto - big mistake! The risotto was so bland and completely overcooked. I got a few side veggies and they were edible. We skipped dessert, but had the pinot prigio, which was drinkable.   I think everyone should come here at least once. It's a fun and novel experience and it helps that they have a charitable angle. Maybe I'll try the one in Montreal next time!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. We had the surprise 3 course meal, and honestly I was really disappointed. Our first course was the most boring, dry, salad. My date didn't even eat it. The food is comparable to crappy wedding/catering food.  Our waiter left us at our table for a long time between our appetizer and dinner, it actually became pretty boring. We ran out of wine, and no one came to check on us for a while. By the time our dessert came we were ready to get out of there.  I guess it was an interesting experience but  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially since you pay so much for crappy food/wine/service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic!  The concept of eating without vision was intriguing. The dinner was filled with laughs and good conversation.   We were lead in a line to our table and each person to their seat. This was not just dark but you could not see something right in front of your face.   The waiters/waitresses were all blind and allowed us to see how aware you need to be without the vision.   Taking away one sense is said to increase your other senses so as taste and hearing which I believed to be true in this experience.   The meal was extremely delicious. I had the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I also had a surprise beer which was a nice surprise.   The whole experience was unlike anything I have ever done and I hope this spreads to other cities.   A must do!"}
{"text":"So I went to Onoir with my boyfriend for valentines day, thinking it would be super romantic.  I took a star off for each major issue. 1 - The dining room was FREEZING. I wore my winter jacket in the dining area the whole time. 2 - It took over an HOUR for us to get our entrees, and believe me, one hour in complete darkness feels more like 3 hours in real time. You can't take out your phone, you have literally nothing to occupy your time with, which would have been totally cool, if our food had taken maybe 40 min less to get to us. After that long you just start going insane from boredom lol. 3 - The place is UNSANITARY. I dropped my knife on the floor, and when I picked it up to give to our server I could feel huge clumps of dirt and dust clinging to it. I get they probably think 'nobody can see, so no one will know', but that can end up being a health concern. I get that the staff are blind, but think maybe you could work around that, for health and safety sake??? Say I don't know, hire a cleaning service at least once a month if anything... GROSS. 4 - The food was B A D. I ordered the risotto with shrimp and herbs. The shrimp was cold, but okay... However my risotto (supposed to be sweet, salty, and very creamy) tasted like oatmeal that had nothing in it. Like a mushy, tasteless hunk of grain, apparently even salting it was too much effort. In other words I think it is safe to say it is the WORST meal I have ever eaten in a sit-in restaurant EVER.   Perhaps some of these problems were simply unfortunate experiences of mine, maybe I just got unlucky. But the impression I got is that, Onoir prides themselves and seems to have built their fame on their unique dining experience of 'dining in darkness', without actually putting any effort into everything else it takes to have a great dining experience, including factors such as food quality, comfort and cleanliness.  At least i know never to go there again :)"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend yes I'm obsessed daddy.  The food was okay.  Definitely a one time experience.  Once my eyes got used to the darkness I could finally see my girlfriend yayyyyyyyyy. But she could see me more because I'm going pasty as hell"}
{"text":"Interesting concept, interesting location.  I entrance was kind of shady, but after u pass the fascade it was a warm and entertaining resturant.  We ate in total darkness, so I'm not too sure what we were eating.  The food is not the best, but eating in the dark was interesting.  I would recommend you bring your most interesting friends along, so they can tell u stories in the dark.  Props to the servers who are visually disabled and work in the dark."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here this past Saturday night with my fiancé and her parents.  We decided to come here as I had eaten here on a previous visit to Toronto while my fiancé and her parents never had.  When you walk in you enter into a common room which is dimly lit where you order your food.  After your food has been ordered you are escorted into the dark dining room by one of the blind servers.  It is so dark in the dining room that you cannot see you own hand in front of your face.  For dinner I decided to have the arugula salad with Parmesan cheese as my appetizer, my entree was the five pepper filet mignon with potatoes and green beans and for dessert am orange sorbet on top of pineapples.  The service started out on a down note for me as our server only brought out three appetizers and mine was the one missing.  After only a short time it was rectified and I was soon eating.  It probably wasn't the best choice to eat in the dark as the salad was tough to get on the fork and I had to help with my hands a lot.  It was good though and i loved the lemon vinegarette with the Parmesan cheese.  My entree was similarly good as the 5 spices on the steak were tasty and it was very tender.  The potatoes and green beans that it came with were good too and it seemed like I had a never ending supply of green beans.  Finally for dessert I had the orange sorbet which was decent and much to my surprise was on top of the pineapple.  Whenever I had asked what the fruit sorbet was, they had said it was orange with some pineapple.  So you can imagine my surprise whenever I stumbled upon chunks of pineapple in the dark at the bottom of the dish.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here again in the future.  While it is not a place I would frequent, it is a cool thing to try every now and again and the food was really good too!"}
{"text":"Edit: Over-charged tax issue is resolved... error due to cashier not knowing how to handle taxes on Groupon - please check your receipts carefully!   The experience itself was not as exciting as other people mentioned. I went on a weekday so there was only one blind server. The table was equipped with only one fork and the server was pretty busy so she did not bring us water until mid meal (even though we requested several times), did not bring us any napkins (also requested) and did not bring us bread until after we finished our appetizer.   The food itself was mediocre - they were luke warm (maybe they can't have the food too hot in case you hurt yourself? but it was not that good). If you choose a two course meal, skip the dessert- the ice cream tasted like cheap no name ice cream and the cake wasn't great either (probably store bought). I'd say the entree was the best course but I've definitely had better.   I know people say to go for the one time experience but IMO, I would not even go there just to try once. I'm not sure if the experience is better on the weekend but the weekday experience was pretty terrible with bad service and the surprise extra tax at the end."}
{"text":"Went here on 'darkness themed mystery date', so that was obviously perfect. And it was impressive how dark they got the dining room. However, the food and service were average at best, and eating in the dark is 100% less enjoyable than eating not in the dark.  Bottom line: interesting idea and sort of fun to do once, but it's not a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This place give you an experience that probably you have never experienced before. Eating in a pure darkness!  -Reservation is easy but make sure that you book this place cause it can get sold out. -No parking, be ready to put sometime to find a parking spot. ( parked in church st. -It takes a while before someone come and bring you in the dining area. -Food quality is normal, nothing fancy about it. -It is true, they serve the food to you when it is not warm any more and I don't now why! -Service is fine. -Environment is a bit noisy, but probably it makes sense cause when you cant see anything, you want to keep talking and making noise to be sure you are not lost there.... -Will try it again for sure...."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Gavin, our waiter, made us feel so comfortable and welcomed! The food was very nice, flavorful. Portions were just the right size. It is so dark, you cannot see a thing. All that's left is to fully experience the smell, texture and tastes. Very interesting, enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"O'Noir, like many people said, is a restaurant that people go for that 'different' experience.   Pros: - Great for a date night - They hire blind people; ironically, they can navigate around this restaurant better than we can! - The location is amazing- it's in the heart of Toronto - Makes you realize how valuable and important your sense of vision is   Cons: - They have timed dinners which means that they serve people specifically at time a, b or c. If you can't make that time, well tough love.  - It is rather pricey when you're limited to a prix fixe three course meal. I'd recommend checking out the menu online PRIOR to your reservation (p.s. you need reservations)   Without a doubt, O'Noir doesn't need to advertise to get the word out there. It's a great novelty place to go on a date. People go for the hype, for that one time experience. If you haven't been, I seriously recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"I checked this place out a while back during a date and I have to say that I've never experienced anything like this before.  You can either select from a handful of meals OR you can opt for the surprise dishes.  We figured we wanted to keep it a mystery so we decided to order three surprise dishes (entree-dinner-dessert).  Of course, they ask if you have any dietary restrictions when you place your order so don't fret.  You'll be greeted by a blind server who will guide you into the dark dining room.  This part is what I find hard to describe and I highly suggest you check it out yourself. It's definitely more dark than you're imagining though is all I'll say.  Eating in the dark definitely gives you an appreciation for what blind people must go through when eating food and talking to others. It's also a pretty neat experience and slightly messy as utensils become super hard to use when you can't see a thing.  I won't go into details about what I ate as they are surprise dishes for a reason and half the fun is figuring out what it is you're eating. I'll say this though, the food was delicious especially the dessert but nothing really stood out to me. You're largely paying for the experience here but I recommend that everyone checks it out at least once!  One last tidbit, it's a bit expensive and I would probably come here mainly for a date or special occasion of some sort. I also don't have any photos as it would just be a photo of darkness ."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences that I have ever had. Both my friend and I decided it was the best thing that we did on our trip to Toronto. We had two courses, the surprise appetizer with steak and then with pasta. The filet ranks in the top five meals that I have eaten. I would definitely go again, and keep telling everyone about what a wonderful time we had. I wish we could redo it now that we're back in NYC. If I ever make it back to Toronto we will certainly be returning. As many times as we can!!"}
{"text":"Followed everyone else's advice to come here for the unique experience. They were right! You should definitely try this restaurant (at least) once.  We arrived a bit past 8pm for the 8:15pm seating. A hostess greeted us, gave us menus to select our food, and brought us to the lounge area. Once we selected our meals, we were introduced to our server, Dave. He led us into the pitch black dining area ever so slowly, with our arms on each other's shoulders to ensure we all sat at the same table and didn't stumble. From the moment we stepped into the dining area, we got a sense of how the rest of the night would be - dark and confusing with lots of struggles. But it was very interesting, and definitely an experience to remember! We were provided instructions for every little thing (e.g. \"you'll find a napkin in front of you, in front of that a plate with butter on it, to the left a fork and to the right a knife\"). Whenever Dave brought out our food, he would instruct us that he either placed it lightly on our shoulder for us to reach, or that he placed it on the table for us.   All of the food was good. I'm not sure why people keep commenting on how bad the food was - it is typical of any restaurant. You get what you pay for in food, and even more so an amazing experience in this case. Initially, we all used our forks in an attempt to be civilized. Perhaps halfway through the appetizer we gave up and started using our hands. Didn't want to leave any food behind! Sharing our dishes was fun, as we would find something with our fork, guide each other's hands to our fork, and state, \"I thiiiink this is a mushroom/steak/etc.\"  I ordered the portobello mushroom salad for my appetizer, and the mushrooms were delicious. A bit too much dressing on the salad for my liking, but still tasty. For my main I got the fish (salmon) with potatoes (substituted for rice) and veggies (mostly green beans?). This was tasty too, however I wish there was a little more fish and veggies, and a little less potatoes. My boyfriend had the steak (medium rare) and it was very good, I kind of with I got that instead..! For dessert we shared the chocolate cake and chocolate mousse - a bit rich, but still good.  My only complaint was with the rowdy group of kids at the table next to us. They used very vulgar language, were loud the entire time (whether talking or banging on the walls), and kept lighting up their watches/phones. When Dave asked them about the phone, they denied it. It ruined our experience, as we could not enjoy our meal in silence or darkness, and at times we could tell that they were eavesdropping on our conversation (perhaps that's part of the \"heightened senses\" experience haha). Unfortunately, when someone spoke to the hostess, she was very passive about responding to the situation. At that point we just requested to take our dessert to go, cutting our experience short.  All in all, this was still a great experience. It really makes you appreciate your sense of sight. I would definitely recommend trying it (there are sometimes groupons!). If you're able to request a server, ask for Dave! He just exudes joyfulness and cheer all time, made the experience so much better."}
{"text":"O'Noir is perhaps the only place in Toronto where you can enjoy unique experience of eating food in the dark! Their surprise dishes could really surprise you.  ENVIRONMENT: You need to reserve tables before you go there. They have fixed time where guests are allowed. Make sure you check their website to see times when guests are allowed.  You will need to look at the menu outside of dining room. After you tell one of their people what you want, a blind waiter or waitress will take you to their dining room where it's pitch-dark. You will need to place your left arm on his/her left shoulder when walking inside their dining room.  You will eat in a room where it is pitch dark, lights are absolutely not allowed in here. This is a really interesting environment because they say when you can't see anything, your other senses will become more sensitive. I will talk about this in Food section below.  The fun part about eating in dark is that you get to find where your food is and find out what kind of flavoring they have. For me finding food was like a game so I really enjoyed the experience.  FOOD: There are two types of prix fixe meal courses. $32 for either appetizer + main or main + dessert. $39 for appetizer + main +dessert. All courses comes with one bread.  Me and my friend ordered 1. Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Parmigiano and Balsamic Vinegar on a Mixed Green Salad 2. Grilled Calamari on a Mixed Green Salad  3. 2 of Five Spice O.Noir Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables   In the darkness, I actually tried to figure out what kind of flavors they put on my dishes. I managed to figure them out and I thought it was very fun to figure them out.  Overall I really enjoyed to eat all of them. Although the portions were small for $32. If you order surprise dishes then don't expect your waiter/waitress to tell you what the dishes are. Total surprise for ya! If would be fun to check out what surprise dishes are.  PRICE: For $32, don't expect this place to make you full. I'd say even $39 meal wouldn't make you full. For app+main dish, if you get it elsewhere it would cost you $16.  However, experience is priceless. If your goal is to add this fantastic experience to your life, then I would definitely recommend you to go try it at least once. I would personally go to this place two times in total. Second time when I go, I would order surprise dishes.  BOTTOM LINE: Try it at least once"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. Not only do you leave with an enlightenment and appreciation of what it is to be sightless; the food and service was outstanding.   This is a must do for anyone wanting to experience something out of the ordinary.   Go with a couple friends and share the experience!!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience. But it was completely ruined by awful food. Seriously, not cooked or even junk food would be much better. We are not that picky, but we couldn't eat anything."}
{"text":"Took 2 hours and 30 minutes to get served a three course meal. I spent $15 on a coke & ice tea because refills are not free..... Im glad, I didn't order more drinks. Calamari was inedible, I spit it back on my plate. My steak was lukewarm and was old, tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave... I ate it all because the hour wait from appetizer to main course was an hour and I was starving.  Surprise dessert tasted like a grocery store bought piece of cake. I headed to Jack Astors afterwards because I was left hungry and dissatisfied.  $110 for two people...not worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely believe the reviews on the food. Expect a banquet hall meal for sure - I got the roasted vegetable appetizer and the filet main course. The beef was cooked to order which was nice - however the remainder of the meal was unremarkable. The green beans were long, awkward to eat, and coated in instant gravy. And the roasted potatoes were cold and slightly over cooked.  The experience however was definitely unforgettable! Our server was patient and courteous and was always around in case we needed anything.  My only gripe on the atmosphere was we were there during a busy time on a Friday night so it did get really loud (drunks) - definitely go for an off-peak dinner hour!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The experience was very eye-opening! Staff was very attentive, courteous, and knowledgable. The room was full of guests but we weren't forgotten even though we weren't seen.   The experience itself made me appreciate what I have and what others are missing. It also added a new dimension to enjoying a meal. Since I couldn't see what was on my fork with each bite, I had no idea what to expect. Try loading up your fork with your eyes closed at your table tonight! Tough, eh? I would highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"Very cool concept, and I had a fun time. It's too bad the food sucked.  My appetizer was calamari and it was very meh.  For my main, I had shrimp and risotto. The shrimp were a nice size and not bad tasting, but the risotto was bland and there seemed to be some sort of sauce on the side of my plate that was pretty bad.  My friends had steak, which they both described as \"ok\". (The steak comes pre-cut by the way. No steak knives in the dark.  That would make for a great CSI episode though.)  The eating in the dark concept was well-executed. You order at the bar before you go in to the dining room. You're then introduced to your server (all servers are blind) and brought in to the dining room (you form a little train with your server in the lead). You will need to turn off your cell phones and any other devices before you go in. Once we were in there, our server (Diana) did a good job of taking care of us, passing us drinks one at a time, gathering all the plates from one course before bringing another, etc.  All the things they have to do so that we can eat in total darkness.   The menu is prix-fixe by the way. $31 for an app and main or $39 for an app, main, and dessert.   Despite my 2* rating, I do believe this is worth checking out, for the experience.  Don't get me wrong - the food is not \"bad\" and it's definitely not inedible. I don't regret my decision to go to O Noir. However, the food needs to be improved, and it definitely doesn't justify the prices they're charging."}
{"text":"Dining in the dark - it sounds novel until you actually do it... Meeting my server, he escorted my wife and I to our table. Going through the first door left us in a reasonably dark space. Only after going through the second door were we immersed in pitch darkness. Our server Nasir was incredibly gracious. Following his direction we were able to sit comfortably at our table and discover our utensils. We had to come to grips with the floodgate of emotions that consumed us. Understand that there will be an initial psychological impact on being in the dark. A sense of helplessness and despair may overwhelm you. It will cease to be fun early on. However, if you are going to endure you must embrace it. After about 15 minutes of conversation and holding my wife's hand, we were able to relax enough to have conversations throughout dinner.   The Experience: Eating without vision for those with sight is mind bending. Although you know what you ordered, where it is placed on the plate and what it looks like is an unknown. There must be a tremendous sense of faith and trust in not only your unseeing server, but also the preparation team. You soon determine placement of what you will need to eat - your utensils, your drink, your plate and eventually each food article - visualizing based upon touch and memory. Your sense of smell is not as keen as you think it is. The sense of touch actually drove much of my engagement with the food. Mouth-feel was very important as I attempted to identify what I was eating based upon how it tasted and felt in my mouth. I felt clumsy often groping in the darkness. Because I could not adequately use my fork, I eventually put it to the side to use my hands. Yet, a deep sense of appreciation for those whose lives are enveloped in blackness soon made its way into my heart. The experience was eye-opening.  The Food: For a starter I had the arugula salad and roasted peppers. It is difficult to go wrong with a salad and they did not disappoint. I would have preferred it without the mushrooms. I'm not a fan and don't like the mouth feel. The peppers were delicious, boasting a decent blend of sweet and bitter. The goat cheese was a tad overwhelming. Yet, all-in-all it was quite tasty. For a main dish I had the filet with potatoes and vegetables. The meat was prepared perfectly, with a pepper rub that gave it a nice pop. The potatoes and vegetables (green beans) were standard course. For dessert, you can't go wrong with a fruit sorbet.  Overall: It was an eye-opening experience. The food was good. The environment \"uncomfortable\". It often felt that the meal was prolonged in order for me to fully experience the impact of eating in darkness. A typical three course meal takes my wife and I about 1 hour. This took 1.5 hours. We spent a lot of time waiting between courses. It was great for conversation. However, it does lend itself to obsessing on the environment. The lit lounge was dimly lit which was not that inviting. It appeared well lit after being in a veil of darkness for the meal. A balance would have been appreciated. All-in-all, good food, unique experience; I recommend everyone eat there at least once."}
{"text":"Terrible atmosphere. Not only do you have to eat your food with your hands it's an extremely uncomfortable environment in pitch black the food is sub par with very fishy fish and low-end beef. You can't complain or say anything since your dining in the dark but the food tastes horrendous. The prices are extremely high for the quality of food and service you are receiving. Would never recommend this place"}
{"text":"The experience was a once in a lifetime experience. You are plunged into absolute darkness when you enter the dining room, and you really have to rely on your other senses for the rest of the meal. The service was good too. The downfall was the food. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the \"surprise menu\", and it was very underwhelming. I would advise others to order from the actual menu instead of just getting the \"surprise\" menu, as the rest of my family's food was better than mine, but probably still not worth the price paid."}
{"text":"I was actually there for my birthday.  The experience of dining there was without a doubt unforgettable.  Can't say the service was the greatest, but was not horrible either we pre ordered our dinner before entering the dining area.  We were lead in by our server who then explained where we could find our silverware napkin bread and butter.  It was completely dark in there. Took a while to adjust after I did you start hearing bits and pieces of other conversation I remember hearing someone curse because she had just spilled her drink I thought sucks to be her! lol  Now our food was very yummy. Started with a salad was average. Our steak was cut up for us, it had great taste cooked just right.  Didn't need anything no salt or sauce.  The veggies were cooked just right. Desert was incredible. Chocolate cake with ice cream i couldn't even finish my desert it was just too much.  After dinner we were lead out and asked for our check I was prepared to leave 25% tip but when they rang us up they included the tip with out asking, 15% for a party of 3 don't know if that is the way things are but I thought it was rude. Prices are reasonable our tab was a few bucks from 200usd for 3 with drinks.  I will try one of these places again. Encourage others to go, I don't however believe that because you dine in the dark your taste buds are somehow more sensitive or that you will love your meal any more or less. :)"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving this place a four stars is because of the experience. O Noir executed dining in the dark perfectly. The restaurant lobby was dimly lit but the actual seating area was pitch black.   I am happy that I went to this restaurant because the experience was like no other. I was quiet uncomfortable because the experience was true to what a blind person feels. Our server was very good and made it easy to get to our seats and  grab our food from his hands.   I had the calamari which was grilled and chicken and vegetables for my main. The calamari dish was good and easy to eat in the dark because I could feel my fork stabbing the squid. My friend had the salad and she struggled a bit more because it was  harder to get the lettuce. The chicken with cream sauce was excellent ! The chicken was tender and the sauce was delicious.  The hardest part of the night was spreading butter on my bread. The place was cold due to the darkness. The only area of improvement would be serving food at hotter temperature."}
{"text":"An excellent experience but mediocre food at a hefty price. You're definitely paying for the experience here and not the food. I came here on date night with the $64 coupon for two (Keep in mind you will still have to pay taxes (around $25).   Excellent service, our server Dave was memorable, kind and just awesome overall.  I won't be going into the details of the experience as I really think you just need to experience for yourself!   I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot for the experience but I personally probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"5 star for experience, 3 star for food. I've never done anything like this, when you think of a pitch black room it's usually one you're familiar with, this dining room however, holds 40 people and you can't even see your hand an inch in front of your face, but can over hear the chatter of all the other guests. Unique dining and friendly staff, which I would highly recommend to try at least once. I doubt if it would be enough to bring me back a second time, the octopus to start was great, but my 'surprise' main (which came recommended by the host) was mediocre at best; BLAND basic over cooked rice, del dante plain broccoli and chicken, no added flavors. My BF on the other hand ordered the filet minot with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli and it trumped the 'surprise' by a long shot! It was the saving grace of the night. Although hard to feed one another in the dark it was a fun experience feeling around for all of your utensils, glasses etc. The sorbet for dessert was yummy as well. I will confess after arriving for their 8:15 time slot we didn't get out of there until after 10, and we both were still hungry when we got home."}
{"text":"COME HERE IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK! or If your date is butt ugly and you think she/he might have some amazing personality that you might overlook the sore sight on his/her face (just not on this date).  I'm extremely afraid of the dark. In fact I sleep with night lights. Due to the hype, I wanted to try this place for the longest time, forgetting my aforesaid phobia. When I finally stood in front of this restaurant, I suddenly remembered my fear and started pacing around like manic. I mean, who wouldn't be? This place looked like a hidden gateway to hell, a forgotten haunted house and a psychopath hideaway - this restaurant is actually below ground with entrance at the end of long set of staircase that's emerged at a street corner. After two sets of sturdy doors and very dimmed foyer, you will find bump into other patrons who are just as nervous as you are. Then you will notice the sunglasses wearing waiters. And yes, you will find the atmosphere spooky as if you stepped into the mansion of Adam's family. And then, you will find the bar / intake area, still gloomy with dimmed lighting. Now, you will start to wonder if you really went to the wrong place. Worry not, this is the right place. You will be picking your 3 course meal here. Although you are somewhat inwardly sacredly, you will display full enthusiasm as you make your way through the short and not so impressive menu. Might if I suggest, pick everything off their \"SURPRISE\" menu. Then someone wearing sunglasses will lead you into the pitch black dining room. You will make a choochoo train with him/her and your date. And of course, you will giggle at first, then panic as you walk into the non-lit room. Let's pray to god your table isn't beside a pole or a wall. Because you will likely hurt yourself by walking into them. The dining experience is purely dependent on the quality of conversation you have with your date. If you have a irritating, dull and obnoxious date, this hour long dining experience in dark will surely suck. However, if the conversation is smooth and interesting, you will like it as much as I did. See how I didn't mention anything about the food? Well, if I did, that'd ruin the surprise!"}
{"text":"O Noir is an incredibly unforgettable dining experience. Partly because of the company that I came with and the dining in the dark concept. I have heard from friends that went about their experiences prior, but I was not prepared for how it would feel to be in total darkness. The first 5 minutes that I was in the dark was really scary. I felt completely out of control and I was telling the server that I needed to leave. The server, Dave was reassuring and said that he would bring me out if I felt uncomfortable after a few minutes. I found that closing my eyes helped a lot, because it was the feeling of having my eyes open and not being able to see that was really scary.   I went with a big group and we had 8 at the table. I didn't know many of the people as it was with a social group. I thought that it was fine, I could hear everyone at the table and getting to know people in the dark is also a unique experience.   The food was good and they cut the meat up to make things easier. I recommend getting the surprise dishes because it was fun to guess what I was eating. The best part of the experience was when the entire restaurant sang happy birthday together. I'm not sure how common this is as the social group that I was with really made that happen when we joined in with the waiters that were singing. I would definitely go back and I think it would be a good date restaurant too."}
{"text":"I came here for my bf's birthday as a party of 7. They were very accommodating even though we initially booked for 10. I was at first skeptical since so many reviews commented so negatively about the food. We were waited in the guest area where orders are taken before you head into the pitch black rooms. The vibe of the restaurant is quite different than what I expected, the decor and design reminds you of an English pub with dim lighting, accented poles and moulding. Looking at their menu offerings, I was expecting something dressier. After our orders were taken, we were lead inside the pitch black room by a blind server...boy did she walk fast...almost lost a couple of us. After we were seated, we received bread, which was piping hot and soft. For apps, I got surprise meat which was a chicken dish...(not gonna spoil it). It was delicious but a lil too fun to figure out how much food you had left - it wasn't a lot, but definitely more than 8 bites. It was flavourful and not an excessive amount of spice. For mains, I got the steak and it was perfectly done and well seasoned. The mash and beans were also delicious, nice and buttery. I tried a bit of the mystery main, which was a pork. It was also very nice, tender, juicy and flavourful. Dessert wasn't too special, but not bad. Overall, it was a really fun experience, our group pranked each other, food was great, decent portions, nothing came cold. I couldn't say it was hard to guess what the food was, or that it was gourmet food but I was very happy with the experience. Our whole group liked it a lot. For those complaining how it was horrible & so underwhelming...I think they need to factor in the value of all of this. For under $40+tips & tax, you get 3 delicious courses, a unique experience and wonderful service. That's not even the price of the highest Winterlicious for god's sake!"}
{"text":"I came to O.Noir for my birthday dinner. It was a surprise dinner for me and I was looking forward to coming here for ages. When you arrive it's on a corner and it looks like you're entering a haunted basement lol. It seems like you can only do two reservations, one at 545 and one at 8 or so. We did the 545 because that was all that was left on a Wednesday evening.  When we arrived, they asked us to order around the bar area. I found the meal a bit pricey overall. I decided on the grilled octopus, filet mignon and chocolate cake with icecream. The food was okay to be honest. I like being able to see my food (which defeats the purpose of coming here) but it just seemed okay to me. The octopus had good flavour, so did the steak (which I thought said on the menu roasted, but end up being mashed) and green beans. The chocolate cake was a little dry but having ice cream helped a little. Ps. my friend told me that their \"surprise dish\" is just one of the dishes that are listed. They just choose for you. I had some malbec wine with my meal which was okay as well.   Honestly it was just a very average experience. I'm giving it 3 stars since the server was super nice, the experience was interesting and I got to spend my birthday doing something different :) I'm not sure if I'll come back for awhile, maybe once every 2 years or so since I don't always like eating with my hands!"}
{"text":"This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  My dentist, of all people, recommended this place to me. Eating food in the dark?  What a concept!  I'm down.   My friend and I made our reservation, and off we went into a dim basement restaurant. We went to the bar area and placed our order with the bartender: goat cheese and roasted vegetables to start, filet mignon with potatoes and vegetables, and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Then we are escorted by our waiter by holding on to his shoulders. My friend and I giggled as we adjusted to the darkness, sure that we were using poor table manners as we attempted to use our utensils to retrieve the food. Yes, I resorted to using my fingers at some point. For all I know, someone at another table could have been picking their nose. :-P  Not only was this an interesting experience, it was a learning experience as well. The room is completely pitch-black, not even Exit signs are illuminated. There were times when my I thought that I saw some light, but I realized that I couldn't when I closed my eyes, put my hands in front of them, and still saw the light. It also helped me appreciate what I have that some people don't: my vision. Having to use my other senses to do another thing we take for granted, eating, was a humbling experience.   I enjoyed it here very much, and I would recommend it to anyone that visits."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant after finding it on Groupon. Hubby had gone out of town and I wanted to have a nice dinner with one of my best friends while he was away.  Groupon is one of the best places to find great eats. This one did not disappoint. Upon arrival, you pick your dinner items from the menu in a well-lit space. When you go inside to eat, however, the lights are off!  Yes, that's right; you eat in complete darkness and your server is blind. This experience opens up all the senses in a way I didn't expect. The food was phenomenal The steak was cut up for me and seasoned/cooked to perfection. The potatoes were unbelievably tasty. The only disappointment was the dessert. They accommodate gluten free beautifully excepting this option. The only choice I had was a fruit sorbet which had a sour touch I didn't enjoy. Otherwise, everything was delicious.   At first, I kind of freaked out and thought it would be far too difficult to eat in complete darkness, but you get used to it faster than you'd think. And you gain a new sense of empathy for those left without sight. Our blind waiter was far more capable in this element than us. He performed perfectly and helped us find our utensils and was careful to show us where our cups and plates were by taking our hands He did a phenomenal job. The conversation took on a new element as well without being able to see my friend.   No one can see you, so it's okay to touch your plate to see if anything remains or to guide your fork.   Great food, perfect service and one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Highly recommended and wish to visit again!"}
{"text":"Very interesting experience.  The food not so much.  I ordered the shrimp and risotto dish, the shrimp was burnt and risotto was bland. The veggies on the side were plain green beans. Definitely not worth the price.    Dave was a friendly waiter."}
{"text":"Novelty wise, the experience gets 5 stars.  It's really interesting to experience the pitch black darkness and to interact with your dinner mates without being able to see them.  Our waitress Chelsea also deserves 5 stars.  She was pleasant and efficient and did a great job of ensuring everyone received their food/drinks with no spillage or mishaps.  She is a real find!  The food though is just what others have said, overpriced, bland, just nothing that would wow your taste buds.  The food didn't even have the smell of food to excite you, certainly not fresh made or quality ingredients.   But the clincher?  The horrendous bar/checkout staff.  I wont even go into details as any business that would employ such ignorant staff, clearly doesn't care about customer service.  Nothing but a money grab.  Take the advice of others and create your own dining in the dark experience with better food and ambiance."}
{"text":"If someone asked me the worst dining experience ever, I wouldn't be able to think of a place. I've had a few bad ones but wouldn't say it was the worst. NOW I HAVE THE WORST ONE. O.Noir in Toronto, the worst dining experience ever in my entire life.  Service 0/5 Food 0/5  I still can't believe and so upset that I paid 40 bucks for eating rubbish and being offended. I'm definitely not happy at all and I actually had a few bites only.  I ordered CREAM pasta and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. My friend had a 3 course meal.  After my friend finished the starter, we waited A LOT, way too much. Our server came to us after a long time. We expected the food coming but he gave us a napkin and told us the food was coming shortly. However it didn't come right away. We waited for a long time, again.  Then we got the main dish. I got TOMATO pasta (I can understand this one. People make mistakes). I was so surprised not that it was tomato pasta, but that it was cold and tasted terrible. My friend tried my pasta although it was completely dark. I told her to try because it was unbelievably bad. I called our server and told him it wasn't the one that I'd ordered. He took it back, I waited and eventually got the cream pasta. Again, it was way too bad. The pasta was cold, the sauce wasn't flavourful at all, just insipid and the penne was overcooked. I had like 5-6 pennes. I mean it was just penne whenever I had a bite. On the menu, they said cream pasta with vegetables but it didn't seem to be served with veggies. I knew I wasn't allowed to do so but I took my phone out, covered the screen with my phone case and clicked a button so that I can have a dim light for a second. My friend and I took a quick look and it was literally cream sauce, pepper and penne only.  I didn't eat anymore. It didn't taste good enough to eat, far below average. I'm not kidding. I had a hectic day so I ate a falafel sandwich and a piece of apple cake at noon and had nothing else the whole day. We got there at 8:30, and I assume I got the pasta around 10pm since we waited too long. I was super hungry so anything okay would've tasted good for me at that moment.  Although I wasn't asked how the food was, I told the server it was the worst pasta I've ever had so I didn't eat that much but you can take it anyways. He said he would let him know. He didn't even say anything like I'm sorry, I'm sorry to hear that you know, those things.  We didn't wait much for the dessert. When the server came back with the dessert, he didn't say anything about the pasta or anything he heard from the kitchen. The dessert wasn't the worst like the main dish but not a decent one, considering the price. Seemed like a scoop of cheap glocery ice cream and so did the chocolate cake.  When we went to the cashier we looked at the time and it was 10:30ish. We must have waited a lot between the first and the second course since we didn't take much time eating the second course, didn't wait much for the dessert, had the dessert pretty quick and called the server that we were set to go.  I asked the cashier if the 15% tip was mandatory (they wrote that sort of thing on the menu) and started telling her how bad the pasta and the service was. She didn't even hear me out. She cut me off by saying 'you don't have to tip if you didn't like the service.'  O.Noir is a ropey place. Don't bother yourself to pay a visit. The darkness was unique. That's it. My Friday night was severely ruined."}
{"text":"Very cool experience. Who knew eating in the dark would be so difficult and fun."}
{"text":"My grandpa's completely blind so my mom and I decided to try this place out and get a sense of what it's like.   I have to start by saying that our server (Gavin I believe) was great--he was friendly, helped us adjust to the dark, and every time he came to bring our plates to our table he would ask us if we needed anything. BUT my experience here was HORRIBLE and this was mainly due to the long wait. I had a 3-course while my mom had a 2-course and it took us TWO AND A HALF HOURS. This wasn't because we took long eating or anything, it was because our server just rarely ever came to our table. He would only come when delivering food, and the wait in between each course was way too long.  I'll go into more detail about why it was a terrible experience though: First, there are only 2 reservation times on their website. I couldn't make the 5:45 so it had to be 8:15, which is already pretty late. When we got there, the hostess was so unclear with the instructions. We weren't sure who would be taking our orders, when we would go in, whether we pay before or after, etc. Then, when it was time to go into the dark dining area, our server led us. The place is PITCH DARK. I can't remember ever being in such darkness so at first I felt pretty anxious and uneasy, but I got used to it after a while. While I was ordering outside, I asked the hostess what the sweetest cocktail was and she said Sweet Tart so that's what I got. It was anything but sweet--terribly blended and tasted like pure alcohol. So that was the first thing I received from the server and already pretty disappointed. Next, we got bread and the server helped us feel where the bread basket was so we thought he would leave it at our table for us to enjoy but NOPE, he was just letting us each grab a piece of bread and then he took it away. Then we waited around 30 minutes in the dark for our starters. I had the calamari and my mom had the octopus--both were so hard to eat. By that I mean they were either overcooked or they were sitting out for too long because I couldn't even stick my fork into it... that's how hard it was. Then we seriously waited for around 40 minutes for our mains. I had the chicken and she had the fish: the serving size was big and it was cut up for us. The chicken was really good, with potatoes and artichokes. But by that time, it must've already been almost 10pm and I had lost my appetite so I couldn't finish mine. Then we waited a long time for our dessert--fruit sorbet. It tasted good in the dark but I'm pretty sure if I saw it with lights on, I would say it wasn't worth the money. At the end, I felt puking. Must have been a combination of the time, the dark, and the food.   On top of that, the washrooms are so dirty. Most of the stalls had no toilet paper, they ran out of paper towels, and the garbage cans were overflowing.   So overall, it was a TERRIBLE experience. If you want to try eating in the dark, cook at home and turn the lights out and close the blinds. I would never ever ever go back."}
{"text":"Finally found time to go here! First of all, I was very surprised to find out there are only 2 sittings per night (for Saturday it was 5:45 and 8:30, may be different on other evenings) and they book up fast, so get your reservations in an advance. Once you see how the whole set up works, it makes sense why they don't have people coming and going throughout the night.  Our food was very good, of course you're going for the experience and not the food, but based on others' reviews I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed our meal. The appetizer came out right away, but the time between apps and mains was quite long - hard to tell how long, being in the dark! Expect to sit for 2+ hours, especially if you order a bottle of wine, as the glasses are filled for you, and you'll need to wait for the waiter to come back around to ask for the fill.  Another tip - food is pre-cut! Don't be afraid to order the steak, it comes in bite sized pieces. Same with the veggie dishes.   The experience - don't want to give away too much but it truly is an experience where you can't see your hand in front of your face. You have no idea how big the room is, how many people are in it, and if your waiter is standing next to you or not. It's cute to hear the people around you - everyone tends to giggle and whisper like a 10 year old's sleepover party after your parents warn you to go to bed. I'd love to go back with a group and see how that dynamic is. You use your hands A LOT. Wash them before you go in - you'll be grasping at your plate quite a bit, especially when they bring the bread rolls. You will get messy - take this opportunity to chew and speak with your mouth full, no one will be the wiser :)   I'll definitely be back with unsuspecting victims, I mean, other friends."}

{"text":"To celebrate my sister's birthday, I wanted to do something fun and different.  I thought O.Noir would be just that. I'd heard from friends that it is an interesting experience.  Already the rage in Europe, Australia, L.A., New York and Montreal - O.NOIR - Canada's first-ever \"Dine in the Dark\" restaurant now invites Torontonians to experience food, drink and conversation like never before - without their sight!  \"It's a sensual dining experience like no other!\" says O.NOIR owner and founder Moe Alameddine. \"When you eat food in the dark, your remaining senses are heightened to savour the smell and taste of food. Even simple, everyday dishes like potatoes and yogurt take on a culinary flare.\"  But O.NOIR does more than just fire the imagination and stimulate the senses. After a few hours in complete darkness (that's right, no flashlights, matches, cell phones, cigarette lighters or luminous watches), customers gain a better understanding of what it's like to be blind - just like the restaurant's entire wait staff.  This socially conscious concept sprang from Jorge Spielmann, a blind pastor in Zurich who used to blindfold his dinner guests at his home so they could share his eating experience. In 1999, Spielmann opened Blindekuh (German for Blind Cow), a project aimed at teaching the sighted about the sightless world, and provide jobs for blind people.  When you enter, you wait in the lounge where you can have a drink.  Maria, the bartender, took our food order in the lounge. Gord and Sister Sarah ordered Grilled Portobello Mushroom with Parmigiano shavings and balsamic vinegar for their starters. Gord and I both ordered Five Spice Filet mignon served with Potatoes and Vegetables (we passed on the veggies, though) as our main. Sister Sarah ordered Pasta with light Tomato Sauce and Vegetables. For dessert, Gord and I ordered Dark Chocolate Mousse with Rasberry. Sister Sarah opted for the \"Surprise Dessert\". They have a \"surprise\" starter, main and dessert on the menu ... you have no idea what it is until they bring it to you and you have to figure it out when you eat it.  Gord and I knew we'd be eating in the dark. We had told Sister Sarah that there was something special about the restaurant but we wouldn't tell her what.  Tracy, our server, came to lead us into the restaurant ... we had to put our left hand on the shoulder of the person ahead of us. No doubt that confused Sister Sarah!  The restaurant is pitch dark ... serious, it's DARK. You can't see a thing ... nothing! I must admit that it is freaky at first and takes a while to get used to. Tracy was great and told us where everything was ... our knife, fork, butter, etc.  The potatoes were thickly sliced and the steak was cut up. I tried eating with my utensils but gave up and ate with my hands. I did eat my dessert with the my spoon ... which was guided by my fingers.   Because it wasn't very crowded, they let us stay longer than usual (we were there about three hours) to continue to enjoy the experience.  The next time I have visitors from out of town, I'd definitely take them there. The food was good and the service was excellent!  You should check it out! Go during the week, though, because Tracy said it gets loud during the weekends (it's sold out) and not as enjoyable."}
{"text":"O.Noir is a novelty restaurant located in Church Wellesley village with another location in Montreal where customers eat in complete darkness. Yes, absolute darkness as in absolutely nothing in the room is discernible apart from the pitch black darkness surrounding you.  I came on a Friday night with my boyfriend for the first serving (5:45). The way it works is that you first go to the waiting area to claim your reservation, then look at the menu. There's a choice of a 2 course meal, (appetizer OR main, dessert) or 3 course meal (all three). We both ordered the filet mignon which had a mashed potato and veggie side for our main, and chocolate mousse for dessert.  The staff took our order, and our blind server took us conga-style to our table. It was unsettling at first to have my sight taken away - I was scared I would hit my head on something or trip. Our server was understanding and guided us slowly to our table, then gave us a description of the chairs + tabletop arrangement.  The bread they gave was good; it was really warm and fresh. Our steak was tender, juicy, and flavourful (it was also cut for us!) and the mashed potatoes were great as well. I grew tired of trying to get a forkful of green beans but coming up with an empty fork so I ended up eating them with my fingers. The chocolate mousse was good for the first few bites, but it became excessively sweet for me. You're also unable to even see what the food looks like, so your opinion of the food is only affected by taste and not the plating or visual factor.  Our server was awesome - he gave us enough time to finish our food and was super patient.  All in all, it was an enjoyable dinner and I would definitely recommend this experience."}
{"text":"This is quite the experience. A great place to dine with friends or on date (just not a first date though). It's literally a three course meal in the dark. The food is ok. Nothing too fancy or brag about. The selling point is the dining in the dark wxpwinx"}
{"text":"interesting experience. good service. good portion. 18%tip(pre groupon value) will be added to the bill"}
{"text":"For a real different experience, the latest addition in Toronto is a 'blind' restaurant. It's called 'O Noir'. Basically, you eat in COMPLETE DARKNESS and you get served by blind ppl. It's something your friends will think is really different. It's about $38 per head for a three course meal. The food Is pretty good (though I wish the portions were a little bigger). Bascially, it's really good if you order the filet mignon for your main course (as usually filets are $30 or so in other restaurants). You can even choose to have a 'surprise' appetizer, or desert. You will have no idea what it is, nor can you actually see it. Make a reservation before hand.   I had tonnes of fun as I went two days in a row. The first time, i was getting used to the experience. The second time, I was stealing food of my friends plates and pulling little pranks. Was tonnes of fun.  Though i've been told by a few restauranteurs that it's become a very common place for some public necking and mischief. Not sure if i want to go back with that knowledge.  But lets still face the facts here - as different as it is, it is still eating in the dark, in some random basement, on cheap furniture, with terrible service and banquetish food. It's jsut unique - thats all."}
{"text":"I reccently decided to try o noir because of its unique dining experience and Groupon deal which was going on. I'll get back to the Groupon deal in a second but first the dining experience.  The dining experience is very unique and intersting  having to rely much heavily on your other senses other than sight. It can get quite loud in the rooms because people assume they cannot be heard or something when the light is off and that the room isn't very large. Another nucence is that although the staff advise diners no phones, people still check their phones which ruin the experience and is blinding.  The appetizers came out very quickly and I had the calamari while my of had the salad. The food was better than expected considering what I have heard from other reviews I've read prior to eating there.  We waited I'm assuming 30 mins at least for the main entre to arrive assuming its due to the fact that we were seated first and the other partons were just starting their apps. When the main course finally arrived it didn't disappoint I had the stake and my gf had the chicken dish. Both were on point and the portion size was good.  Finally the deserts came out a lot quicker than the wait for the main entree. I had the surprise desert and my gf had the sorbet. Nothing special but I did enjoy the surprise which I believe is a fruit based cake.  Finally when paying for the dinner with my Groupon I was shocked that it didn't not have taxes paid on the vouch which I was expecting. The gratitude were auto charged to my balance which ended up being $13 based off of 15%, which I did expect. Overall savings of the Groupon deal was nil due to this fact and I was a little disappointed that this was not more explicitly stated on the voucher I purchased.  Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to O.Noir on 3 separate occasions - recent visit was for a birthday celebration in September 2013! Finally writing a review for this extraordinary restaurant where you can dine in the dark! Thank you for bringing this concept to Toronto :D A lot of people say that this is a once in a life time thing, but I would say, as long as I have great companies with me, I don't mind going back there again for the 4th time!  Food is alright (can't expect too much) but it is more for the experience :) You will also realized that things you normally feel like you can do with your eyes closed, can make you seem extremely incapable when dining in the dark. For example, buttering my bread, feeding someone dessert, or play rock, paper, scissors lol.  5 important things you should know.... ;)  1) Servers are legally blind, but the kitchen staff ARE NOT!! It would make sense right? lol. Funny thing is I still hear people asking this question hahaha...  2) Oddly, they only offer 2 dinner services - 5:45pm and 8:30pm, so be there on time!  3) Go as a small group (4-6 people)... easier to talk because you will constantly be TALKING. So, maybe NOT so good for first dates/blind dates unless you talk A LOT and if you don't mind awkward silence. Nor is it good idea for crazy large parties (how DO you even talk??!)  4) You should know what you're eating on your 1st visit (according to me!), although some might be tempted to go for the \"surprise menu\". Hey, at the end of the day, you still want to pay for something you would enjoy and not something you would eat on Fear Factor lol. The 3 course meal include tax and tips would roughly be around $50... no change in price over the many years (+1)!  5) You pretty much WILL end up eating with your hands at some point lol."}
{"text":"it is a good experience. the food is good, not  unforgettable. The food need to include ingredients with strong smells. In that way, you can live the olfactory and gustatory experience. Of course, it's a unique dining experience in the dark. However, I consider that they lack to  deliver a paper with the surprised dish that you eat or that you server tells you in the end.Beside, if you want to do a excelent service, the restaurant need other host with best attitude. Because, she speak as bitter and hurry  you to choose  your menu.  She doesn't give suggestions. In this kind of restaurants is important a good service"}
{"text":"The concept is interesting, and the experience of eating in absolute pitch darkness was worth trying, but I'd never go back. The seating was very cramped and tables are very close together, which makes the acoustics even more unbearable. The noise was literally so loud at times we had to shout across the table to hear one another.  I had the portobello mushroom salad with parmesan as an appetizer, which was outstanding. The Argentinian malbec wine was served warm, which was not ideal. My filet mignon steak was served medium rare instead of medium well (which of course you don't realize until you've started eating it), and the waitress never returned to check on us. Dessert was supposed to be a chocolate mousse but instead I was given strawberry cheesecake, and again there was no way to find the waitress to inform her of this.   After being led back out of the dining room, you have to line up single file to pay your bill at one cash register, which is ridiculous. After taking two hours to complete our meal, waiting another fifteen minutes to pay for it was annoying.  The food was tasty, but the slow service, food errors, and loud atmosphere mean that I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!! (Even with the ignorant jerk sitting beside us with his phone light on and off multiple times) the waiter was so friendly and the food was good. Totally worth it if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!!! Highly recommended. Food was good, a three course meal costs $40, so you get what you pay for. I enjoyed everything and we had the \"Surprise menu\" Go for it! Was fun to try and figure out what you're eating!!  Great to experience what it must be like for the blind or visually impaired."}
{"text":"I was quite scared to try this place as i am afraid of the dark; but nonetheless it was a unique experience.   We got a groupon deal and paid approx 64 for the groupon deal without tax and tips. Tips and tax is extra.  The waitress is so sweet! she came to check up on us constantly and asked us if we have any questions.   The food isnt as bad as i thought. It is kind of true that the food isnt warm as my appetizer octopus came cold. The octopus was full of spice and is juicy. the steak was pretty good - It was flavourful, hot and pre-cut for you. Obviously i cant see the portion size but i felt like theres a lot of steak.   We got ice cream so it was quite messy but fun to eat.   Overall, it was an experience thats different - an experience without using your phone!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different, fun, and with delicious fold, then ONOIR is the place to go. Me and a friend had dinner here and had a lot of fun eating, talking, and joking around in the dark. From trying to figure out what our surprise dishes were to making sure that we actually finished we had a fun time! Definitely recommended n definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend and this is definitely a unique experience. The servers were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very relaxed. I thought we'd be escorted into private rooms but it seemed to be multiple rooms with at least 40 seats in each room. My boyfriend and I both got the 2-course meal. He ordered a surprise starter and got the filet mignon served with potatoes and veggies. I ordered the grilled octopus and risotto with shrimp.   The room we were in was very noisy (or at least it seemed that way to me) and it seemed that there was a lot of people dining as well.  I'm not sure if it was because of the lack of vision, but the flavours of every food I had was enhanced. I could taste the saltiness of the mignon, the acidity of the octopus, the rich creamy taste of the risotto in more detail than I thought I could have. There was only slight difficulty in eating the food since you can't really see your plate at all (believe me, it was complete darkness) but it's not too difficult if you just move your hands around slowly to feel for the utensils. I have to admit I did accidentally stick my finger in the butter once or twice and I almost knocked over my glass of water.   Overall, a great experience and I would recommend to couples or friends who want a change of pace in their usual dining dates."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars! I came here mainly for the experience, and what a great experience it was. My friend got a Groupon for dinner here (apparently they always have one going on) and we went on a weeknight.   Once we were in the waiting area, we were handed menus and had our orders taken. We then were brought over to the entrance of the seating area and introduced to Nasir, our server. He is visually impaired, and led us to our table in the pitch black dining area. It was funny, I kept waiting for my eyes to adjust and to be able to see maybe a little bit, but it was so dark in that room that it never happened! I ordered the surprise meat appetizer (gotta love the name...), the shrimp and mushroom risotto, and the surprise dessert. From what I could tell, the app was a curry dish and was quite good! The risotto was also very nice and was a good thing that it didn't need any salt or pepper - I have no idea how I would have accomplished that. I tried my friend's filet mignon and it was tender and tasty. Dessert was chocolate cheesecake...yummy! I got the hang of eating without seeing pretty fast, using a 'guide thumb' and taking my time. Just make sure you wash your hands before you eat. ;) Many people have commented on the long wait times between courses, but we were in and out in less than 90mins, and that included us sitting and chatting for a bit after our meals. I guess it depends on how busy it is. It was such a unique experience to eat in complete darkness. You really don't appreciate what you have until an experience like this. I was very impressed with Nasir the server, he navigated the room like a pro and was superb.  I would definitely get another groupon and return!"}
{"text":"A really cool experience, and the food was not nearly as bad as some reviewers said.  Food is not scalding hot, but that is for safety reasons, I am sure.  Its interesting to *see* what you notice without your sight.  And having a blind waiter, in itself, was a fascinating experience!  He knew exactly where the table was... where I had to reach out with my hands to find the table and my chair.    My friend and I both went for the roasted red peppers for the appetizer, filet mignon for  the main, and chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert.    All the food was tasty, and the steak was a perfect medium rare as ordered.  Again, the food is not able to be kept warm on hot plates, so it cools down quickly, but it arrived at our table warm, not cold.  The piece of cake was tasty - but huge... it was only when I ran out of ice cream and could still feel cake on my plate that I realized how big a piece it was... couldn't finish it!  If you are up for a fun and fascinating experience, give it a try.   But if you expect a gourmet dinner, and can't appreciate the fun, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Cool concept and a great waiter but the food for money was just NOT worth it. Could do better eating some pho at midnight in the dark."}
{"text":"I wanted to experience O'Noir due to the high media coverage and unique experience.  Here are my pros and cons:  Pros: Seductive yet haunting setting when you enter the restaurant premise.   Eating in the dark enhances your other senses and gives you a dining experience which will make you thankful for your sight. Helpful and friendly blind waiter/waitress.  You will be impressed with their sense of directions in serving you the food. The food is ok in comparison to other restaurants It forces you to gain   Cons: There is no advertisement on the front of the building.  The restaurant is located inside an apartment building. The front end staff is not very helpful and didn't give us the feeling that we were about to experience something unique.  She pretty much rushed us without directions to the menu. The portion sizes are very small - take note of the size because you can't see.  I would not go back on a regular basis but maybe in another 2 years to see if anything has changed."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting and fun experience! Makes for a great date. I had the filet mignon and my partner had the shrimp, and both were delicious. The chocolate cake was a bit dry but not bad. Worth checking out at least once. I'll be going back and bringing new people! As others have said, you're paying more for the experience than the food, but I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Just to reiterate what the other reviews said... The steak was fantastic. Because you are forced to visualize what your food looks like you find that it stays with you longer. Even though I didn't 'see' my steak, I have an extremely defined image of what I thought it looked like.  One course and you drop your utensils and start exploring the food by hand. It definitely adds to the experience.  I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but our server was visually impaired which added a level of appreciation to the experience."}
{"text":"I went to N. Noir restaurant on Church Street in Toronto last night, and it was an amazing experience. You start by pre-ordering your meal off the menu (appetizer, main course and desert), or you can have the option of ordering a 'surprise meal' which can be anything off the main menu (they will also accommodate you even if you need a gluten free meal)   Once this is done, you are advised to shut off your cell phone and remove your watch or any items that hold or reflect light. You are then escorted in a dining room that is completely dark. It is so dark you can't even see your hand in front of your face. Suddenly your senses completely go into over drive. You can hear conversations from other people in the dining room loud and clear and you can smell every dish in that passes by you in the completely dark dining room.  It gets even more interesting when you try and guess what you are eating. There were eight of us in our group and only person was able to guess the starter, main course and desert. The food is very good (not for gourmet pallets) but still very tasty and reasonably priced for a Toronto restaurant down town.  Eating in the dark with nothing but your knife and fork (ok I cheated a couple of times and used my fingers) and drinking from a glass you can't even see is also a bit of a challenge,but it is the experience you are going to remember.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a birthday party celebration or even if you just want to a restaurant experience that is fun and unique!  The 4 stars are for the service and experience but I would give the food and menu selection 3.5."}
{"text":"Eating in the dark....what an experience!!! I booked for a friend's birthday & we both loved it! At first I was very nervous as I had to use all my other senses. Our server Dave was great, he explained everything and made us very comfortable.Moving onto food... I ordered Calamari for starters which was quite flavorful and tasty. For mains...I had steak (medium well), garlic mash potatoes and green beans. The steak was cooked to perfection and everything else on my plate was to die for.  As a whole, I would 100% do this again."}
{"text":"As far as the experience goes, it was amazing. I took my significant other for a surprise anniversary dinner, which turned out to be a great surprise for both of us. It's incredible how much we normally pay attention to around us, but when you are placed in the complete darkness the rest of your senses heighten, which leads to great conversations and great taste sensations.  I also love the fact that it contributes to the independence of the visually impaired people who work there, and makes you realize how much we take for granted.  We both got meat surprise appetizers and meat for the main course, which were streaks and they were great. One thing I would recommend to change, is to improve the quality of their food, however I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great experience, average food. As mentioned the place can be loud but this is because of the other people around you and not the restaurant itself. People tend to talk a lot and very loud because they don't see anyone. It seems like they are afraid they will cease to exist if they cannot be heard. Despite this I enjoyed myself it was a fun experienced eating a meal in that manner. The food was OK without being amazing. Nothing was cold and the service was great. This is a place that I would definitely recommend that you try once, but beyond being a novelty dinner for friends who have never been there, I cannot see myself dining there again."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of o noir I set my expectations low. Surprisingly, I was quite content with my visit.   Customer service: all the staff was friendly and informative. Our server (who was blind) did a great job at making us feel at ease in the dark and navigating us through the dining room. I think peoples expectations of customer service level are a little ridiculous in this establishment. It's one server assigned to a fairly large section. She did her best to check up on us but she was always assisting someone with something. Wether it be serving someone, clearing dishes, escorting them to the washroom or refilling drinks. So your server won't check on you as often as they would in a lot establishment because in general all the customer require more attention. She didn't a great job of spreading herself evenly amongst us all.  Food: my food was delicious. I had the goat cheese and roaster peppers for a starter. And the filet mignon for my main. My starter was perfect I love goat cheese and I love vegetables so they couldn't really go wrong. Everything was seasoned well and there was a generous portion of goat cheese. It was actually creamier than usual so I wondered if they blended it. Regardless I would order it again and again. My steak and potatoes were cooked and seasoned to perfection. I liked that they cut my meal up in bite size portions which made it easier to eat in the dark. Again the serving size was more than generous and i didn't have and green beans on my plate i was served a side of asparagus. I had a surprise dessert which I didn't like very much it tasted like a cold fruit cake I didn't finish it.  Atmosphere: sorry but this place in dingy and even the bathrooms look sketchy. I honestly think they need to reconsider the grungy decor and maybe they could reel in more returning customers.  Reading reviews in advance prepared me for the 18% gratuity automatically added ( regardless if you are a group or a couple) and the food temperature. Had I not known that would have been a bit off putting as I like my food served hot. But I understand that it is a safety precaution. A lot of the reviewers referred to it as banquet food and I guess I agree it isn't a 5 star meal with elaborate flavour profiles but it was delicious.  It's a good experience that I recommend everyone tries. Blind people are so underestimated and is amazing to see them overcome obstacles and show the world that they are just a abled.   P.s I really struggled to butter my bread in the dark it was hilarious"}
{"text":"Y'know the saying, \"You eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth.\"? Well, that doesn't apply here. At O'Noir, you are literally eating in pitch black DARKNESS. (Yes, I'll repeat it once more. Darkness.) Sounds crazy, eh? Well, it is. I been here two times and the experience just never seems to get old. Look at it this way. 6892 days was me eating in plain sight, while on the other hand, 2 days in complete darkness.   Their philosophy is basically if you lose one of your senses, the others are heightened. Meaning, the taste of the food will be more distinct as well as the smell of it. Although I didn't find the food to \"taste\" better, what I did find was that I ate faster than I normally would. Also, utensils were only used for about 2 minutes before I resorted to caveman style (Using my hands). Oh yeah, I wore a white shirt.... and came out looking like a brown cow. The cost was on the pricey side with an appetizer or dessert + main for $32 or all three for $39, but damn, the whole crazy eating in the dark fiasco definately makes it worth while. I mean c'mon WHEN on earth are you ever going to eat in complete darkness? Not to mention, WHERE in Toronto?   Answer: Just one night at O'Noir.  I tried:  2 appetizers: Grilled portabello (Flavourful) + Calamari (Underseasoned)  3 mains: Filet mignon (Juicy + Tender), Chicken breast (Underseasoned and too much tomato sauce), and Veal (I've had better)."}
{"text":"First of all, it's truly is PITCH BLACK, which is part of the experience, but it can be intimidating at first. I wouldn't go back, but I'm happy I experienced it. The food was mediocre, and service was above average. The only thing, the atmosphere in the main lobby before entering one of 4 dark rooms was terrible. You enter a lounge area, check out a menu and order your meal and beverage. The lounge hasn't been updated since the 70's! It was smelly, old and uncomfortable. The dark rooms where you eat obviously you couldn't tell what it looked like, but you could tell it was cheap, the cutlery, the tables, the chairs, everything was old and cheap. I don't think they should look good, but the feeling of the cheapness stood out. I would recommend going, but don't expect anything other than an experience."}
{"text":"I have a lot of mixed feelings and emotions on how to rate this review.   If you judge by the experience of dining in the dark - 5 stars isn't enough. If you are basing it off of our waiter - Dave is the cats meow!! He was very attentive, informative,  and also just the kind of guy that you're happy to have come around to your table. But the food - the food was just not good. I would have given it 2 stars, but the chocolate mousse, chocolate cake and \"surprise dessert\", which I'm pretty sure was cheesecake (but this was not confirmed) bumped it back up to 3.   We went to O.Noir on Thanksgiving (American thanksgiving). Let me just say that it's been my dream for a few years to go to a dining in the dark restaurant. We purchased a groupon for the 3 course tasting menu. I think they have it offered quite often, so save yourself about 30 dollars and check that out first!   We were not sure what to expect. We kept saying \"oh there has to be SOME kind of light..\" - if you're wondering, there isn't. It is pitch black. I want you to go into a dark room and then close your eyes.... now you know what it's like to sit in the dining room with your eyes open at O.noir. It was pretty overwhelming at first. But once you take a few breaths, it was actually really amazing!!! You could hear sounds that normally you don't even pay attention to. I remember a couple of times that my cousin mentioned she could hear other people in our dining party eating. It was crazy, just a simple fork clink on the plate was super amplified.   Dave was fabulous! He did a really good job of explaining how everything was going to work. He was really happy and upbeat and when I heard his voice nearby, it made the initial anxiety lower.   I would highly recommend this experience!!! The food here was pretty bad, I would stay far far away from the \"surprise seafood\" appetizer. The main course (we all chose the filet) - was fine but not amazing... the overall experience just got me super pumped and ready to try my dream restaurant, the blindekuh, in Switzerland!!!!"}
{"text":"It was truly an amazing experience. To be able to only use 4 of our senses - touch, smell, hear, and taste. After our meal, the moment we stepped back out I actually felt thankful that I can see.   I felt adventurous so I ordered surprise everything (appetizer, main dish, and dessert). It was quite interesting trying to figure out where my food was. I fumbled around and probably dropped food on the table without realizing. I had to feel for my cup of water and napkin. Which wasn't too too bad. The food was only decent, but hey.. I didn't come here for the food. I came here for the experience. Instead of \"eating\" my food, I was \"tasting\" it.   The service was marvellous and the place was very nicely decorated (can't say for the inside though lol).  I would definitely recommend O.Noir."}
{"text":"My now boyfriend booked O.Noir for our first actual date so this place is very special to me.  I read a lot of mixed reviews as well as watched some YouTube videos as to what to expect since I'm not good with the unknown.  We got to the restaurant which was downstairs and it was dim inside. When you get in there's a bar area where you can have drinks to wait to be brought to the rooms.  We also ordered our meals at the bar area before we went into the dark.  The cost was $39.95 for a 3 course meal or $32.95 for a 2 course.  We both had the 3 course surprise meal. At first I wanted to order the items but then I thought to myself why not get the surprise meats it's not everyday that I come to this place.  You do have the option of not picking  the surprise meal if you're not adventurous.  The servers were all fully or partially visually impaired in the dark rooms.  There are 2 area one side for large groups and one side is more intimate I guess for couples.  We went to the couples side and basically have our hands on the shoulder of the server and followed him into a pitch dark room. All camera and flashlight had to be turned off before you entered the room. The server will guide your hands the entire meal as to where the table, chairs, cutlery and drinks are. At the beginning it was hard to adjust but after awhile your eyes are more adjusted but you still can't see.   It's pretty cool since your smell and taste senses heighten and the food was amazing.  I had wine with my meal which was an adventure trying to not spill each time I reached for my glass. Our first surprise course was grilled octopus it was delicious.  Our surprise mains was steak.  It was cut for us so that we can just eat it.  I had to use my other hands to guide me to the food and to my mouth. Third surprise course was chocolate cake. So good. Not sure if it was a good idea for the first date since you can potentially have food all over your face and clothes by the time you were done. My boyfriend tried to be sweet and fed me in the dark but the food went into my cheek! Lol when you're done the server guide you back out and you're pretty much blinded by the bright light.  It was an amazing experience, service was great and the food was fantastic!  I highly recommend everyone to come experience O.Noir!"}
{"text":"OK ... let's get to the jist of this review ... people were absolutely up to some freaky-deaky shinanigans in that pitch black restaurant.  Ha ha ha ... good stuff. I actually asked the bartender before going in if they had night cameras or if any of the wait staff had vision with night vision goggles and she said no.  in fact, she told us that initially at the Montreal location they had cameras and upon reviewing the tapes they were shocked at what they saw (i.e. people going to town), removed the cameras and decided they didn't need them.  I'm still not sure if i believe them ... but it did seem like a bit of an invitation.  Oh the Montrealers.  Such a passionate bunch ;) Now, onto the experience and the food .... when they say pitch darkness, they mean it.  your eyes don't adjust over time, nothing ... blackness.  it was a little odd at first, but remaining calm and taking in the whole experience and you actually get into it.  it was thoroughly enjoyable. i had the pepper filet (which WAS already cut ... which was the only possible reason you would consider not ordering this dish being unsure about the complications of chopping up your steak), along with a glass of merlot ... and the taste sensations, which of course were heightened, was devine.   the octopus and calamari apps were interesting ... the salad that came with them was the hardest to eat for sure.  again tho, already cut up chunks, so all cool in the gang there. dessert - i went for the 'surprise' which turned out to be some sort of chocolate mousse ... yummy :). this is kinda like skydiving ... it isn't something you really need to do more than once, unless you've got a screw loose ... but everyone should experience this at least once.  maybe twice if there were a few things you wanted to do and missed on that first visit! ha... At $39 3 course meal, it really isn't too expensive.  The experience is worth it alone. Go blind already.  Go."}
{"text":"It's one of those \"must try\" places in Toronto, but in the \"must try just once\" way.   When we walk in, we check in the the girl at the front desk, and grab some menus. Supposedly, someone will come around the waiting area and take our orders. This was not clear to us though, so we lined up for the checkout line without knowing. Also, because my date has a common name, they missed his name for almost half an hour past our reservation time, and finally realized we were waiting.  Food was mediocre. My date ordered grilled octopus, steak and fruit sorbet. I tried each dish and they were all.......mediocre! None were terrible, but none were amazing either. I ordered the surprise for each course, and my starter was a salad. From my taste identification skills, the salad had spinach, arugula, apricot, cranberries and some other things, but quite basic! The main was chicken and asparagus. Hm, very basic. Dessert was a bit better, tasted like a cheesecake parfait, or a pudding version of cheesecake.   The experience itself was interesting. My date and I went full-out and ordered wine as well. It's amazing how aware I become as to where everything is based on touch and memory, but managed to drink (and enjoy!) my wine with no mishaps. Can't say the same for the table next to us, smashed glass and all. Our server was very good, and made sure we were comfortable the whole time.  If this was just a restaurant, I'd give it a 3 star only, food was mediocre and service ok. But given the type of experience, I'd say definintely try it out if you have no problems with the dark. Very interesting place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming to onoir with my friend for her bachelorette dinner. Although we weren't highly impressed with our starter but loved our filet and our surprise dessert! The room was crazy black and we couldn't even try to make out shapes or anything. Nasir was an amazing waiter!!! Definatly going back"}
{"text":"My experience seems to have differed from that of many people here.  Our waiter, Elias, was extremely efficient and friendly (ok, he did get a little snappy when he realized we'd finished eating a while earlier and hadn't called for him for the next course, but we were dining, not just experiencing the dark, and enjoying each other's company), never mixed up orders, projected his voice expertly so we always knew when he was coming to us and not to the next group at the long table (a gap of one seat on either side was left between us and their party).  My fish and veggies was quite good. I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that \"fish and veggie,\" no \"s\", but that's just a quibble.   As previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.  The desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face.   I know some people find the \"atmosphere\" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.  The room is *dark*. They have double-layer black-out curtains to keep all light from the door or kitchen window out of the room; I'm *extremely* photosensitive so could just make out a bit of movement when my friend waved his hands at me, but that was it.   The one warning I'd give, other than the ones given by others here (and I definitely disagree with some of them - we enjoyed our food and the service, though it wasn't the best meal either of us had ever had), is:   If you are photosensitive, BE CAREFUL.  The moment I walked out of the dining room, I had *stabbing* pains in my eyes. So bad strangers were offering me sunglasses, and one of the sighted servers saw me in obvious pain and brought me to a very dark corner to give my eyes more time (she mentioned that they do, occasionally, get a customer like me, whose eyes don't adjust back quickly, and recommended I keep sunglasses on until I went to bed). I was in pain the rest of the night. :("}
{"text":"I can't say much beyond what others have already said. Go once for the experience, not the food. It's pretty standard wedding-style prix-fixe food that is executed adequately (it's not bad food; everything tastes fine). I've been to both Toronto and Montreal locations and can report that the quality levels are essentially equal.  The experience itself is fun though! The wait staff are good at making sure service happens with a limited amount of fumbling and tumbling, and it's very cool to give your optic nerve the night off and see how that affects not only your experience with food but with your companions as well. I recommend the surprise options for the courses to maximize the experience.  I have to say that it's a shame that O. Noir doesn't fancy itself a purveyor of truly good quality, interesting food, because think of how cool it would be to get surprising flavors and textures and process all of that using only your sense of taste? It is as if the owners think to themselves \"but we're already putting them in the dark--why risk alienating people further with unfamiliar food?\"   I understand that perspective, including the many logistical factors a place like this must have to consider that no other restaurant has to, but the last time I checked, not every really interesting menu was full of jarring items like offal or horse meat.  I actually think people would flock to a place like this--more than just once--if there were a creative chef at the helm who could provide seasonal menus that would really make use of the in-the-dark concept."}
{"text":"Overall it was a fun experience but the food was average at best. It was also really loud so at times it was hard to hear my partner over our meal. Definitely worth trying out once for the experience but I probably wouldn't ever go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and an amazing experience.  Everyone should at least try it once. It's about $40 a person tax and tip not included.  It was well worth it and I highly recommend taking a date.   You MUST order starter, main, and dessert as all surprises for the full experience!!"}
{"text":"wow wow what a great experience! .At first I was a little hesitant and kind of nervous. Because not being able to see what I am eating is a little nerve racking to me. apon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly hostess in the lighted bar area where we were shown menu's. we made our selections and then it was explained that we would be guided in and helped to our table. Our wine was promptly brought to our table and we were introduced to our server who was super friendly . She explained were our wine was placed on the table and the position of our silverware .Let me tell you I couldn't even see my hand in front of me. It sure heightened your sense of hearing and smell. Our steak arrived cut into little bite size pieces and melted in your mouth cooked to perfection. I was amazed we never dropped any food. What an amazing experience! . Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful and cool experience! Loved the entire concept of the restaurant, the entire staff was extremely friendly, and the food was amazing! I'm a vegetarian, and they were super accommodating with my mean (as I told them that when I arrived). As others have said - if you're not used to eating in the dark, I'd recommend wearing something you don't mind spilling on!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say this place is AMAZING!!!! I for sure thought this would have turned out to be a disaster of a night but it turned out better than I expected. When this restaurant first opened I told myself I would NEVER go because I have to be able to see what I am eating. Out of nowhere I decided to post an event of facebook to see how many of my friends would be down to try this amazing concept. I was surprised after minutes of posting I had people confirming. In total 8 of us attend and I think that is what made this tones more fun.  I was originally worried about the meal because people told me the food wasn't the greatest, I had the Roasted Red Peppers and Seasonal Vegetables with Goat Cheese for the starter and the O.Noir Filet Mignon Served with Potatoes and Vegetables for the main. I was extremely pleased with how everything tasted. Actually both dishes were delicious and I would recommend either one of them in a heartbeat.   The experience, overall the service was incredible. From the start when out waitress Tracy brought us into the room to the the end. I have to admit i started to freak out for the first 30 mins then I got comfortable with my surroundings. Enjoyed laughs, drinks, and a great meal..   Would I return.. Yes.. with just one other person.. not sure.."}
{"text":"Gavin was awesome! Really down to earth and friendly. He made the experience enjoyable and relaxing. His instructions were clear and he genuinely seemed happy while working. The overall dinning was pretty good. It is something I recommend trying for sure. The food was not very good nor we the wine; but I feel no one is really going for just the food. I suggest going with an open mind and embracing the experience. It really helps to show you where you may be lacking in your communication skills.  Tip: you get to pick your menu options before being led to the dark dinning room."}
{"text":"A novelty experience worth doing once and then perhaps again years later.    There is definitely something to be said for eating in total darkness.  It is incredible how difficult it is and it makes you realize how reliant on sight you are for the most basic of tasks.  I was pretty much useless with a fork let alone finding my wine.  Conversation is somehow more intense as  you lose all visual cues. There is a collage of noise and, in the darkens, you really have to focus on who is speaking to follow the conversation.   It makes for a very unique experience.   Unfortunately the food is mediocre at best and that is what downgrades this to a novelty.  If more attention was spent on the menu, it could be much more and would be likely something I would do more often or recommend with greater gusto."}
{"text":"Hosted my Fiance's surprise birthday here on a Sat night.   We were a large group (12) and the restaurant was very accommodating. Several birthday groups that night.   DECOR: yes it is dark. Chairs are cheap banquet style chairs. Tables are small and narrow. As we were leaving ( our party was the last out), some one in our group turned on their phone in the dark and I caught a glimpse of the room. It kinda looks like a 70's era rec room basement. Brick walls and no personality (who will see it!?). The \"bar\" area is old and dingy- very 70's porn star. I expected a more modern and sleek interior. The restaurant is in the basement of an apartment building with a steep flight of stairs to get down. The entry feels unfinished and the coat check was \"out of order\" the night we went. The bathrooms were filthy by the end of the night- it doesn't feel like the hostess staff check on them.  FOOD: overall the ppl in the group loved their food. I brought cupcakes as the Birthday cake and the restaurant was happy to serve this at the end for me instead of their dessert.  APPS:  At the start of the meal you get a bread basket- (watch out (!) butter is on your plate when you first sit down!) I had the Red pepper and Goat cheese it was very flavourful and filling. My Fiance had the Octopus- he liked the texture and portion size. 2 guests did not like their salad (too plain/ next to no dressing on it). The calamari portion was also very small according to our friends. MAIN: I had the shrimp and Risotto- shrimp was over cooked and tough but the risotto was buttery and smooth. My Fiance had the steak and LOVED it. He even ate the veggies! (maybe cuz he couldn't see them! but rare none the less).  The only negative was a member of our group DID NOT get her food and the waiter took a long time to come back to check on us- this meant she waited even longer till she could eat. Everyone else at the table was finished their main by the time she was served. DRINKS: you place your order before going inside and the waiter then grabs more through your dining experience. Be aware- the pop is from the \"bar tap\" and on our night is was more soda water then Coke or Sprite. We had to ask our waiter several times to replace it. The only negative I would say as well is that the server doesn't bring water unless you ask for it (repeatedly). In dining establishments this should be an automatic thing.   NOISE: it is very noisy. (I had a headache by the time we finished) There is no background music (perhaps this would have helped calm down the masses?) In the dark people feel the need to talk louder because they can not see how far away some one is from them. The waiter had to shout over the noise to announce the dishes. Our group had a few \"screaming girls\" who got frightened by every slight thing. THIS IS NOT A ROMANTIC FIRST DATE PLACE. Its easy to slip into silence and think the other person has left.   Overall we enjoyed the experience and would go back again on a week night."}
{"text":"Picked our menu choices in a greeting room. We were then lead hand on shoulder to our table in the dark.   We used to the walls as walking guides.  Everyone was served water. No straws for beverages.  We picked our beverages.  I received a ginger ale instead of Diet Coke so there are mix ups.  Warm Bread served.  Interesting to butter bread without getting your fingers in the butter.  fun to eat the salad and entrees in the dark.  Even more fun switching plates and moving drinks on kids.  I had the fried catfish with rice and green beans.  Others in the party had filet mignon and shrimp.  Tip in was mandatory 18 percent.  Don't expect 5 star service and food.  Just go for the experience of eating in the dark with friends and family.  A must do."}
{"text":"5/5 for the experience - very unique and I surprisingly enjoyed eating in the dark even though I was really nervous beforehand.   2/5 for the food - it's not terrible... you definitely wouldn't come here just for the food though."}
{"text":"You don't come for the food. A simple but fair statement, Onoir is a dining experience and definitely worth a try. I feel like it is all well done with the choice of food made before with a simple but broad menu featuring surprise options for each course.  I have been twice as its close to my home and a great option to bring visitors too. The first visit was so disconcerting I had to take a toilet break to see something - freaked ha. You just don't adapt to it. Our food experiences were good but to elaborate on my opening comment it is never going to be about the food. Logic would dicate an experience orientated restaurant like this needs to keep it simple and appeal to a broad range. I read one reviewer complain about having to eat with their hands. . . You are provided with a knife and fork so you don't \"have\" to do anything. But yes I tucked in with my hands to make sure I got every last bite and worth giving a try :)"}
{"text":"After dining here multiple times, I can confidently say that this restaurant is only good for the gimmick of eating in the dark.   The service is great and usually timed very well to allow you to have enough time to chat with your date or friend without letting you go hungry. You must also keep in mind that the style of service is very different from typical restaurants. The servers will not be checking up if you need more water because they can't even see if you're finished! It is a bit ridiculous to expect this restaurant to have the same service as a lit one. The servers are very responsive so call out to them if you need anything.   The food is average at best. The experience of O.Noir is supposed to \"enhance your other senses\", but if your food is overcooked or too cold, having \"enhanced senses\" are not going to help you overlook this.   Make sure to wash your hands before you eat. You will most likely be relying on them to eat your meal and to check if there's anything left on your plate.  It's nice to try this place once. Other than that, you can find better food elsewhere for a better price."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. Valid for a one time experience but that's about it. The whole experience took over 2,5 hours. We were most of the time thirsty (wine and water are not served as often), hungry (there was a break of 40 min between appetizer and entree) or annoyed. The food was okay but the dessert was gross: it tasted like frozen dessert and a bad quality tasteless ice cream.  I expected way more paying a total bill of +150 for 2 people (we had wine)."}
{"text":"What an experience eating in the dark feeling for everything not knowing what's left on your plate cannot see even an inch in front of you if you're in Toronto it's a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend recently for the first time after wanting to try it for years!  The setup of the place is cool. It's underground and once you get inside the environment is kind of dark and gloomy. A hostess greets you and hands you the menu because you need to order before you go inside. There are few options under each category- appetizer, main and dessert. There is an option to get a 3 course meal, or just 2. We both got 2, just appetizer and main because we have been trying to eat well. There is also an option under each category to get the 'surprise.'  For my appetizer I got the portobello mushroom salad and for my main I got a pesto chicken.  We were then lead into the dining room by our server. It felt so weird having to be seriously assisted sitting down and finding our plates and feeling out our surroundings. The experience definitely made me empathize what the blind have to deal with everyday.   The waiter brought us bread, shortly followed by the appetizer. I tried to use cutlery but found it pretty difficult and ended up saying screw it an mostly ate with my hands. Same with during the main course. The food was very good, but apparently when you can't see your other senses are heightened, so maybe had I been able to see it wouldn't have been as good, who knows!  Eating in the pitch black was definitely an experience. You literally can't see a thing. I was constantly worried about knocking something over or making a mess.  When we were finished eating we tried to converse but found it difficult to due to the loudness of the place as well as the fact that we were so distracted by the dark. We got out of there as soon as we could and realized we had only been in for an hour. I guess you eat faster when you can't see!  Overall a cool and different experience and I definitely learned a lot from it! Would recommend it to friends.  On a funny side note, my boyfriend ordered the surprise main and thought he was eating chicken and cous cous but it turns out it was pork and quinoa :P"}
{"text":"One of the best experience we ever had. Especially Dave was amazing, his enthusiasm makes the experience even better. The food was also tasteful. Highly recommended!"}
