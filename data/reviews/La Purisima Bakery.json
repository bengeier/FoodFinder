{"text":"Went in at 7am this morning to buy a bunch of goodies for my coworkers and the staff was very helpful. They explained what items were and helped me pick out the best they had to offer. Needless to say, everyone at work enjoyed their delicious treats! Will haven't income back soon!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bakery in the valley. I was not born or raised around Mexican food at all (first time I had a burrito was at 19). Regardless, this bakery has made me fall in love with Mexican food and culture! The ladies at the cashier stand are so nice!"}
{"text":"The  owners are incredibly sweet. The prices are beyond reasonable. Great small business! @Frankie S. : They go to church on Sunday, that's what's up with that."}
{"text":"Burritos are extremely good and the pastries are awsome.......especially with a cup of a hot beverage.  I especially like the flauta with cheese or flauta with cajeta.   Nothing like grabbing a green burrito, mexican pepsi, and then a flauta to for a business lunch.  I've taking a few of my collegues here and they have loved it as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding fresh baked goods!!  We had a nice friendly lady who helped us out at this bakery around 4pm.  My mom and I stopped in to check it out.  All the cookies were light and crisp, not greasy at all.  The snowball was like 2 cake donuts squished together with frosting and then covered in coconut!!!!!! (Insert heart eyes emoji here.)"}
{"text":"For years I have been missing the true taste of baked goods from Mexico- La Purisima is a gem! Best prices in town and the most friendly staff - no Spanish required you will feel welcomed here! **This is a Central Phoenix must** CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"THE BEST place for fresh tortillas.  The red and green chili is amazing!  The sweet treat are tasty but the tortillas are worth the journey."}
{"text":"I had my first visit here on the way home from work off of the 51 & Indian school as I was desperately searching for a bakery. Since this place is in a predominantly Hispanic area, I was a little apprehensive to visit as sometimes people can treat you a little differently if you don't speak Spanish (I am Mexican & Japanese but all gringa on the inside).    When I entered, I was greeted in English by a very nice lady struggling with replacing the paper in the cash register. She finished up and proceeded to help explain all of the goodies and different types of Conchas behind the counter. I ended up getting a dozen fresh tortillas, 4 sweet breads and 2 Empanadas for only $7.75.    I managed to devour one of the sweet breads on the way home and  was NOT disappointed. It was light and airy with notes of vanilla and by far the freshest I ever had. I will absolutely be back to this bakery and am eager to also try their tamales one day. If you don't mind the neighborhood, be sure to stop by, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I am a Phoenix/Glendale native and have grown up on many of the different mexican bakeries over the past 50 years or so here in the valley. Our family has always kept the bakery items as a special occasional treat and we have not found any that are as good as La Purisima...we used to go to the one in Glendale...but then moved to the east valley and only got these little treats on the rare occasion we would be in Glendale...then we found the one in Phoenix!  Still far, but we will sometimes make a trip just for the pastries (pan de huevo). I am hispanic and love their tamales---(very good masa) and they have good tortillas as well.  I could continue to rave on this place forever....well worth the trip!!  Only downfall is CASH ONLY---but it's understandable during these tough times.  Update  July 2012--the bakery is now called La Promesa--still as good--and they take credit cards now!  Update--Name has been changed back to La Purisima and they are on a cash only system again.  Still same great quality.  Just bought my masa for our annual tamales from them again."}
{"text":"bottom line: Mexican bakery with a huge selection of mexican 'pan dulce' (sweet breads)... things run around .70 and up, depending on complexity.  Their cochinitos are what I get... and their conchas are super fluffy inside and beat any Pro's Ranch Market conchas!"}
{"text":"First time here and it'll definitely not be my last. I got so excited to see so many of my favorite pan dulces that I bought WAY too much. Which turned out to be a good thing because I passed some out to my neighbors and employer for Christmas. The few varieties I had were extremely yummy. What would have made this an even better experience  would have been if they had coffee or hot chocolate, so we could have indulged as soon as we got into the car. Because a warm drink is the best way to enjoy these sweet treats. Next time I come in I will be trying the tortillas and tamales for sure."}
{"text":"Sorry, my review is only going to discuss the tres leche cake I ate from here.  It sucks. It is really dry. All the condensed milk is at the bottom and none of it is in the actual cake. There is an obscene amount of frosting. The weird jelly-on-a-graham-cracker that is used to decorate the top of the cake is really gross too. It looks like it would taste good... but it just totally does not.  I'm certain this bakery excels at other kinds of pastries or baked goods. I mean, it is highly rated on Yelp, so they must do well. And one day, I would love to try their other pastries, and write them another review.  However, AVOID THE TRES LECHE. It tastes like disappointment. Dry disappointment."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to La Purisima for over 30 years now. We  used to frequent their flagship store in Glendale at least once a week back during my childhood.   Now that I am in the East Valley,  I was very happy to find they have a second location in central Phoenix. Closer to me than driving down to Glendale.  Their baked good are all delicious. I tend to always order their conchas with the different colored sugar toppings. So soft and chewy! Bolillos are the best that I have found.   The flour tortillas are truly the best ones out there for me. They are a little on the thicker side, which I happen to like. For some, they may be too thick. I seriously have tried to buy other grocery store flour tortillas to hold me over until I make it to La Purisima. It's always a mistake to do so. No other mass produced tortillas comes close to theirs in taste and texture.  The main reason I drive to La Purisima is for their masa.  Seriously the best thing that they make. My family has been making tamales exclusively with their masa for over three decades.   I hope that La Purisima stays around for many more decades to come!I hope  that one day my son can take his kids there for a tasty Mexican pastry.  Reason for four stars- they really should consider accepting plastic. It's always a pain in the ass to head that way from far away only to remember that they only take cash. Then have to stop at the circle k to buy something random to get cash back. But I should really know better by now!"}
{"text":"Just went today after reading the reviews.  The place is really clean and neat.  When I went in, a guy came out form the back ready to help me.  The pastries and baked goods were labeled all in Spanish so I had no idea what was what.  Most of them were on average $0.60 each.  I guess it was obvious since he started explaining to me what each one was.  I bought 5 pastries = $4.50 and 1 dozen homemade tortillas = $2.50.....AMAZING price right?  I ate the cream filled round bread with powdered sugar on top (Sorry, I don't remember the name) right after I got home and it was yummy!  The pie crust with pineapple filling is really good too.  The sugar coated bread was a little dry.  *Price = REALLY CHEAP *Food = yummy so far *Ambiance = comfortable, nice, friendly"}
{"text":"This bakery is very charming and has amazing pastries. I usually get the Empanada de queso and the Empanada de mango (only .60 each!). They have the best, best, best empanadas I've ever had!  I've only had pastries but I can't wait to try the burritos and tamales because I've heard nothing but good things about them."}
{"text":"La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Three pastries, a bolillo and a tamale for $4.55. The red tamale had amazing flavor and just the right proportions of meat to masa. The masa was a bit sweeter than I am used to but very authentic. Heavenly! I will be back. It is CASH ONLY though."}
{"text":"So many goodies here and for about .70 cents each. Staff was super nice and very helpful explaining what each dessert was. Will go there again yum"}
{"text":"I walked in and right back out. There was a small selection of pan dulce. They place was empty and the shelves didn't have much on them. I was definitely expecting more because of all the reviews I read."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving is approaching and to celebrate, my office had a holiday potluck today. I wanted my contribution to be something out of the ordinary. Empanadas came to mind. Now, I just needed to find someplace closer than Tucson that makes great empanadas.  Yelp! pointed me towards La Purisima Bakery on Indian School Road. I should probably warn you now, in case you don't read to the bottom of this review. Bring cash. They do not accept plastic. Bring lots of cash! You're going to want one of everything!  Actually, the prices are very reasonable here. The dozen assorted empanadas I purchased cost $10 and change. Comparable to the price of a dozen donuts. But that's not a fair comparison. Donuts don't offer the flavors you can find hiding inside the empanadas at La Purisima!  There was strawberry, cherry, apple, guava, pineapple, pumpkin, peach and cheese. I don't even think I named them all... They were perfect! And they were still warm! Regardless of the filling, the pastry crust was amazing.  The cases at La Purisima were stocked full of familiar items. There were also a few things that I have never seen in a Mexican bakery. That's all the reason I need to go back! Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.    The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!  I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to."}
{"text":"Great tamales and customer service. The place is not a eat-in place so we took our food to go. Tamales are near authentic but require more salsa."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   Love their homemade fresh warm tortillas. There is no other place in Az that have delicious homemade tortillas and this is the place to get them.  pan dulce is the best. Although the Az  food regulation made places like this change their ingredients in their baking so make sure to eat pan dulce bread right away or it will dry out. Useful tip, store pan dulce bread in a plastic bag and it will keep bread moisturized and soft so it can last a few days. Great customer service. What I also love about this place, it's super clean. Always."}
{"text":"CASH OR EBT CARD ONLY...!! So, the pastries are moderately sized but not too big and most are reasonably priced at .75 cents or so. Went for the first time today and the cute little lady behind the counter named Rocio was very kind and helpful. The pastries are also very delicious and crisp and there's a varied selection so it's hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Customer service always great, I love the fresh tortillas and their burritos,  red and green! They use New Mexico chili, a little spicy, but good.   I go in the mornings,  always a great fresh selection of pastries!  They take cash only."}
{"text":"They are open now. May be closed for further construction soon - but I got lucky. The tortillas are the best and there is something magical about the green chili burrito - I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Great Pan Dulce......Delicious Tamales......great food......Its their first anniversary and the had free food n bread, everything was splendid and bombay!!! Would give them a 5 but they only accept cash........oh yea forgot their cake was DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is in a predominantly Hispanic area. I went with my husband who is Mexican, but would have felt comfortable going in on my own without him, too. This place is extremely clean- like, not a single spot on the floor, smelling great, organized, well lit and scrubbed down clean. You would never know about this place by just driving by- it is very unassuming but in actuality, LARGE, well run bakery with fresh goodness. They have a very big selection- basically any and every Mexican bread and pastry you could ever imagine. The yelp photos currently up don't reflect that- I wish I took some pics to post up on here. A sign on the wall reminds customers to refrigerate their goods as they use NO PRESERVATIVES. Cash only. The staff are helpful and will let you know what pastry is what since nothing is labeled with name or price. We got about 5 pastries, 1 fresh flan, 1 fresh rice pudding and 2 packages of just made HOT tortillas for $17. Wow!  Everything we got was fresh and delicious. Very homemade type taste. I'll be back. This is probably the best Mexican bakery in the valley- what a hidden gem! I'll definitely be back and will make this my go-to place for all Mexican pastry."}
{"text":"This location is a bit smaller than the West Side store but just as clean and offering the same variety of sweets. The ladies who work the counter are always in the best of moods and on this visit even remembered my usual order.  I was exceptionally famished as I was post hike and really needed to fill my tank so I tore right into that red chili burrito right there in the parking lot. If you want fresh off the belt (hot to the touch) tortillas, you'll have to go to the WS location. Bring your own butter!  No Cards- Cash Only"}
{"text":"Love this place, clean and great service  and of course everything there is amazingly good"}
{"text":"Many years later, still the best tamales I've eaten.  Slight increase in prices over the years (6 for $9) but not by much....still a great value.  I arrived right when it opened on a Saturday morning just to make sure I could buy all three flavor options (cheese & corn, red chili, & green chili). The lady who worked there was very nice, packing my tamales well and giving me plastic forks so I could pig out on my 6 tamales.  I was so bummed that the bakery is not open on Sunday or Monday so I couldn't get more tamales to bring home with me on the flight home."}
{"text":"You know me and my spontaneous pullovers when I see a bakery sign.  Today I was pleasantly surprised, I have never been to an authentic Mexican Bakery.  I felt a little intimidated not knowing what things were even though everything looked amazing.The names were in Spanish but not the prices. I'm telling you, what a steal they were! I have never seen such delicacies at prices that even a child could afford.  I Mean look at this Gorgeous not to mention Scrumptious \"Encocado\" (see pics)........brace your self...... it was .75 cents!!!!!!!   Layers of flaky pastry topped with toasted coconut and sugar, finished of with a dollop of Bavarian cream. DO you even know what Heaven tastes like, I do now.   I also got and equally scrumptious \"Riel de Queso\" only $1.25 and OMG insanely good, crispy and tender pastry filled with cream cheese has got to be one of my favorites and this was out of this world! (see pics)  Miguel the owner has been in the family business since he was 10 years old, this location, open for 7 months, is a branch off from the original location in Glendale that has been opened for 25 years.  Miguel was extremely friendly and explained what all the  tempting treats were, they do custom orders, platters and cakes along with homemade tortillas and red and green chile.   Stop in help support a true local gem. You will be hooked I guarantee it!  Located in the same strip mall as The French Bee ** Hours are Tuesday -Saturday 7am to 7pm     Sunday 7am to 1pm      CLOSED on Mondays"}
{"text":"The BEST of the BEST!!!!! If your looking for pan ducle, look no more! A bit more expensive than other panaderias BUT worth it!"}
{"text":"definitely try the vanilla and caramel flautas  SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Been a fan for while.  Their breads are so soft and chewy and their toppings are generous.  The best green chile I've had.  Spicy and flavorful and used in their tamales and burritos.  The flour tortillas are a little thick but so delicious warmed with butter!  (drooling)  This location has improved it's parking so that is a dramatic change but the lines are just as long.  They did card for a while but I think they're back to cash only."}
{"text":"Great Green Chile Burros and Tamales and awesome Pastries!"}
{"text":"OMG.  The baked goods were delicious. Fresh and not too sweet.  The service was fast and interesting, with old cash registers ( they only take cash) cute hats and aprons put you back in the 50's. The cheese cake was my favorite. Best sweet bread around."}
{"text":"My parents have been taking me here since I was little. Still come here for my mexican bread fix."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My favorite Conchas  Nice lady always there and the bread is so soft, me and my best friend come at all hours no difference always amazing."}
{"text":"Every time we come there is no \"conchas\" the bread that is most bought. Its 5pm, a big line, everyone is coming to buy bread.  Purisima should make more of the bread that us sold the most, especially at this time where most of us buy bread. Supply and demand!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area due to the Chinese New Year festival at the cofco center. After falling in love with all the Mexican pastries at Phoenix Ranch Market I did some research on other various valley Panaderia. This one poped up on Yelp and I had been looking for a good excuse to make it here for a long time. Today was that day! I figured at least if I had a melt down it was on a day I was supposed to cheat :P  Walked in and there were a few families sitting at the tables inside the small space enjoying their weekend special of menudo. First thing I noticed was not only were they a bakery but they also made some Mexican lunch/dinner items as well. That was going to have to wait for another day. I was here to collect sweets for after dinner.  The gentlemen behind the counter was extremely nice and patient as I looked everything over 10 or 20 times. You'll have to excuse my gringoness as I explain the items I wasn't familiar with.  Square, Baked Coconut, Custard Pastry: A type of phyllo dough that had a hole cut in the center which was filled with a custard. The top of the pastry was sprinkled with shredded sweetened coconut and baked golden brown. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA?select=_laOfCHYOXa9CuUJRabhFg  Coconut Sweet Bread: Usually when you see these dome shaped breads they have a pretty dense texture. When we tore into this is was super surprised to find that it was more of a croissant texture. It had been dipped in a sugar glaze then into sweetened coconut flakes. *drool* man I love coconut. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA?select=ZZiHJoOBXRJedGpydREX8g  Empanadas De Calabazas(Pumpkin): Classic cinnamon spiced pumpkin empanada. It was less skimpy on the filling them I'm used to. It was very nice and even more amazing when we dipped it in some honey we had on the table at dinner. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FxEJjLZj6UdsOCGcgEufeA?select=lxtBwRYlOKChEhH4zXze9Q   I have come to appreciate Mexican pastries because they tend to be less sugar laden then American sweets. This means I can eat and enjoy them without feeling as sugar comma'ed as I normally would. I would have to say this bakery has veered a bit towards the American pallet and gone a little heavier on the sugar but still very mild compared to an American pastry/doughnut.  Its local, the people are nice, the prices affordable, everything fresh. I can't think of a single reason not to come and show some support every now and again. You will pay a little more here then you would at food city or pros ranch but the quality is there."}
{"text":"Pros: The women working here were very sweet (it does help to know some Spanish). There was a large selection of sweets, and the pastries/tortillas were delicious and cheap.  Cons: I came here specifically because I'd read good things about their tres leches cake, and honestly, the tres leches cake was terrible. The frosting had a fake, chemical aftertaste, and the milk ran out of the cake, as if they'd just poured a lot of regular milk on it. I don't know if I'd just arrived on an off day or what, but I was extremely disappointed because I was hoping to serve their tres leches cake at my wedding."}
{"text":"I grew up on these pasteries. Every Mothers day, Easter, Christmas, you name it, dad would get up at 4:30 to wait in line with every hispanic family in Phoenix to get a big pink box full of pasteries. I still get them some 20 years later every chance I get, they just do an incredible job. The Pina Empanadas with the extra flaky crust are quite possibly the best baked good I have ever eaten in my life. Yes, better than Tammie Coe, better than Sprinkles, etc. If you come in on the weekend past say 7:30 you're going to have slim pickins as all the good stuff gets gobbled up early."}
{"text":"A single sampling of the Almond Concha proved to be light and airy on the interior with eggy notes and a bit of butter beneath a crackling sugar topping.  Definitely something different and definitely delicious despite not tasting much like almond I have to say this item gave me hope for Mexican pastry in general - definitely a place to consider the next time I head down Indian School Road."}
{"text":"Was searching yelp for some baked goods while waiting for the hubby at QT and came across this lovely little gem! Prices are crazy cheap! And they sell homemade tortillas! Say whaaaaaat!? Bought a dozen for $2.50! And got an array for pastries all for under $8! I can't believe it! Lol definitely the place to go for dessert and sweet tooth fix on a budget! Can't wait to try the tortillas for dinner tonight! We will be coming back to this shop! Yay! :-)"}
{"text":"We found this gem in our travels today. My husband said it was one of the best gelatinas he's every had ( I tried it, it is!) and the pan de dulce was incredible... especially my rebanada. It's the best I've ever had in the states or in Mexico. It was perfection!"}
{"text":"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!   They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.    So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.    I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).    Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.  That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."}
{"text":"Okay, I just stopped in for my first time last Friday morning. Boy, are they nice! I just wanted a cochito, but I decided to try a couple of my other favorites as well.  Here we go. The crust on the empanadas was incredibly flaky and tender. The cream cheese filling is to die for! Here are the bummers. 1. I tasted no molasses at all in my Cochito-although the texture and freshness was awesome. 2. The pumpkin empanada was horrible. The filling was bland, and the crust was- I don't know- bread?!? YUK. Gross.  Sadly, it is one of my favorite empanadas, but never again here¡ I will go again, but I'm not raving. Edit: Later on, I had a funny taste in my mouth.  i realized that the reason the crust was so tender and flaky was that they used a LOT of shortning!! I think I prefer the harder crusts of the Food City and La Tolteca type of empanadas.  I can't fault the flavor of that filling though!!! I will still go back."}
{"text":"Was told about this place by a friend and decided to stop by.  The lady that helped me was really nice and helpful with my questions. The tamales were excellent and some of the best I've ever had. Made some bean burritos with the tortillas and they were excellent as well.  The prices were great, but they only take cash, so beware of that. Highly rommended!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a traditional bakery in Mexico  The Tamales are amazing.  Flour tortillas made right in front of you! Hot and fresh.  Conchas are great, will definitely be back many times"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be a repeat customer.  Everything is fresh & tasty.  They open at 7AM and there was a line waiting at 6:50AM.  I purchased cookies for our firm meeting and everyone loved them, huge hit.  They do not take credit cards, or debit cards, just cash."}
