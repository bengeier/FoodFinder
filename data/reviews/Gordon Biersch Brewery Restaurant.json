{"text":"These people know how its done. I have been there a few times now and I can say with good heart and full stomach, its good. Whats even better, is they treat you with respect. Now I know that may not play out to many people, but to me, the vibe you get from the staff, sets the tone, right off that bat, and its a good vibe here. I even take others there, when i want to be nice and have some class ;)"}
{"text":"Not my favourite Gordon Biersch Restaurant (for example, I prefer the one in San Francisco - but that might be since I prefer San Francisco to Las Vegas in general) but definitely worth considering. It's the same good beer and great burgers & garlic fries."}
{"text":"Yes, a chain.  But great food, and the service is fantastic.  Kenny, the manager, was so great.  He not only made sure we had everything we needed, but also made the evening such a great experience.  I'm not big on chains, but the beer and the vibe here - totally worth the stop!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite happy hour spot, especially when it's cooler outside and you can sit on the patio with the heaters and fire going.  Happy Hour is 3-7PM and 9-CLOSE, in the bar and outside patio areas.  $1 off beer, $5 cocktails, and some appetizer deals.  Last night we ordered my go-to favorite GB beer- Marzen.  Always delicious.  We also got the Homemade Chips ($5; with bacon, blue cheese, some blue cheese sauce (we assumed), and green onions).  They were good, not great, but we ordered a side of blue cheese dressing and that bumped them up a notch.  Also ordered the pork sliders ($5 for 3 total with some onion straws/rings).  They were tasty, but again, not fabulous.  The onion straws were good, though a touch on the greasy side.  I LOVE the crispy artichoke hearts that they have, though they are not on the new happy hour menu, which is sad for me. :-(  Still enjoy our HH though.  Service was good.  Started out strong and then fizzled.  At 530PM on a thursday, the seats were pretty plentiful and it never got packed, but did fill in nicely as the night progressed.  Total came in around $34 (tip included)."}
{"text":"worst place on mill ave better off goin to Burger king for better service and food"}
{"text":"Food is always good. BUT SERVICE????? Arrived last night a 9:45pm, about 20 patrons in the entire place. Wanted to show the place to my brother who recently moved nearby. Waitress took order at 9:55 and was helpful. We ordered from the late nite happy hour menu, sliders, pizza, beers, and one fish stew. Beers then arrived on time, still waiting till 10:30 for food and asked waitress to check; she offered us bread because of the delay. Checked on food again at 10:45. Food arrived at 10:55. We saw the kitchen doing their food rotation and saw no sign of a manager all night. Waitress miscalculated the bill for the last nite happy hour, corrected it, and apologized. Embarrassing!"}
{"text":"OK so it's a chain.  I like it. Not all that terribly different from RAM brewery and the like, but the food is good and the beers are good...that's pretty much all I demand out of a brewpub.  The outdoor balcony seating offers a nice view of the main strip.  Service is generally good. I'd definitely come back here if I was back in town."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite beer!! The hefeweizen is the best!! Good thing you can get it too go or buy it at total wine and more."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for lunch while I was on vacation in Las Vegas and both times it was definitely worth every penny. Last time I ordered the iceberg wedge and the blue cheese dressing was generous and delicious. The bacon was perfectly crisp and had a nice smoked flavor to it. Really good. This time I ordered the goat cheese bruchetta and it was really good too. I'm not sure if the honey drizzle was real honey or not, but the taste was spot on. Both items were on their Small Plate menu and cost $4 and $5 respectively. The portions were perfect for a light lunch and it was    probably under priced given the quality of food you get. I would recommend this place to anyone. It's really great!"}
{"text":"We came here after a (very) long day trip to the Grand Canyon... didn't walk in until close to 10 PM. The bar was fairly dead due to the U2 concert being held down the block, which was A-OK for me. Obviously with a name like Gordon Biersch, German-style beers are the mainstay, including Hefes, Schwarzbiers, and others.  For beer, I started off with the Golden Export (which went surprisingly well with my very large pulled pork sandwich) and later had a Schwarzbier. Both were pretty darn good.  The food was made pretty quickly, though I don't know how much of that had to do with the U2 concert and/or the time of night. Our server was friendly and even asked if my dad wanted only half a slice of double-fudge cake since it was so big. The pork sandwich was very flavorful and the coleslaw lining the lower bun contrasted perfectly with the tangier barbecue sauce. I wasn't sold on the chips, though. They were hot, but they were bland, even with the bit of seasoning they came with.  I'd go back, sure, but I think I prefer Four Peaks more. I'm willing to give GB the benefit of the doubt on the chips, as maybe it was an off-night or just with being so late or whatever. But even though I like the styles of beer they have, I like the wider variety the Peaks locations have."}
{"text":"Awesome service every time we have been here.  The beers are awesome and the food is phenomenal!  Love coming here after a rough day!"}
{"text":"Went to this location with friends Saturday night. Had reservations for 7pm for a table of 7. We arrived about 15 minutes early and we were told that they would not seat until 7. No problem!  At 7:10 we inquired about our table & told it would be a few more minutes. Again ok. There was an event at the mall and the entire area was very busy.  Finally after checking again, we were told there was a party of 3 that had been occupying one of the tables needed for our party since 4 pm. They had paid their bill, but continued to sit at the table. We asked to be seated in another area & were told there were too many other reservations to make that possible.  At 7:45, after talking with the manager, we walked out, and went down the block to another establishment & we were seated within 15 minutes.  We watched several parties without reservations be seated at Gordon Biersch while we waited. It will be a long time before we go back or recommend Gordon Biersch to anyone. I should add that the manager offered a $25 gift card to a party of seven! Not even $5 a person! We spent much more than that down the street!"}
{"text":"I was told this was a great place so I wanted to try it out. Went there for lunch, sat at the bar tables. Pros: TV's, Food, Helpful & friendly staff. Cons: place was a lil $$, Garlic Fries were not at all how I have had them at other locations, small portion, and just a lil Garlic... Hello Garlic Fries. This is still a very nice place, I could as easily give it 4 Stars, but I went for Garlic Fries and was heavily disapointed, I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price.  I have no quarrels with the food it's service that needs immediate attention. I've dined at this place 3 times and I've never had an issue with the food but the service is just dismal. The staff needs to be more attentive to the diners I can't express how bad the service is in this particular location."}
{"text":"I am very generous when it comes to reviewing restaurants but Gordon Biersch lets you down at every opportunity. Friendly service but the wait for the food is out of this world. 30 minutes for a simple salad in which the order turned out to be wrong. Once the right dish actually arrived only lack luster can describe the food. Choose another spot in vegas to get a trendy brewery feel, Gordon isn't worth the trouble!"}
{"text":"A must have is the lobster and shrimp mac & cheese!! It is amazingly delicious. Warm and perfectly mouth watery"}
{"text":"Good place to start off if in Tempe.  The look outside and inside remind me of a Pearl Street Bar and Brewery in Buffalo, NY.  Good food, good drinks.  Has Home brew beer.  The waitress was nice and friendly.  Made you feel special.  Prices were reasonable.  Its about a 7 of 10 in my view."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food was because I waited over an hour for my food and decided to leave.  I can tell you that the service was terrible.  The restaurant was busy so if you see a lot people leave!!!  After about 45 minutes I asked my server how much longer and she never returned. After 15 more minutes I left and went to the hostess stand. Waited for a manager and no apology was given after we told him we waited for over an hour. We left and won't be back. I work in customer service and understand busy times but customer service goes a long way.  I will share my story to. many and choose to spend my money else where."}
{"text":"We were disappointed that they were so inconsistant. Then after writing them and letting them know that we were not happy campers they chose to ignore us and not answer back to explain why their pasta is so inconsistant. good one time and bad the next and then overpriced for what they served the next time. I personally do not understand why a place this expensive can be so totally inconsistant in quality. The pasta they served was old and close to dried out. Panda express is more consistant. This pasta was like it had been sitting till 3 pm after being made for lunch. We will not waste our time or money on these people who cant even answer their email from dissatisfied customers."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a family dinner celebration for my sons 21st birthday.  Our server Allien was just the best.  She made our dinning experience the best time.  She knew when to come by and when to let us enjoy our food. She made perfect recommendations on what to eat as this was our first time here. She was a pleasure to have as a server.  Now the food was also great and we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Kobe cheeseburger or sliders are always a win. Holy hell the garlic fries aren't joking about the garlic, but they ARE delicious."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday, the place was relatively quiet with maybe 7 tables filled. Took 10 minutes to get menu's, another 15 for the waitress to come so we could order drinks, was there for almost 30 min before we got to order food. They never cleared our table and we sat waiting for 30 min with empty glasses and no bill. The food was decent but considering the wait time for an empty restaurant it was definitely not worth it. The waitress was rude, extremely slow and not helpful at all. Over horrible experience."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Rude, disrespectful, and way too much attitude. Our server wouldn't take our order without rolling her eyes. Slammed our waters down on the table. Gave sassy one word answers to questions and refused to be helpful. Manager appologized but never offered to make it better. We left after 10 minutes. Never go here if you want to be treated with respect"}
{"text":"This time I tried the Kobe Sliders and House Salad with the Marzen Vinaigrette. The sliders were just alright. Maybe I can't grok the supposed Kobe, but I couldn't see anything special about these. The House Salad was also just blah, most probably due to the completely tasteless vinaigrette. I thought they hadn't even put it on the top since I couldn't taste any dressing at all!  The atmosphere and service are still pretty good, and the raspberry iced tea wasn't bad either. Again, meh."}
{"text":"Chewy calamari, stone cold fries (made them Redo fries). Our server was very nice, but after just seating two tables on the patio, some other sever comes out and starts shutting down TVs.  Said he was getting prepped for closing. One table hadn't even ordered yet.  Had to ask them to turn them back on.  Here's a novel idea. Don't sit people on the patio if you want to shut it down...or turn tvs off after last guest is gone. Got two stars cuz our server did the right and took off the fries from our bill."}
{"text":"I had lunch at noon and there was no wait. The restaurant had clients but the service was prompt and with good quality.  The waiter continuously replaced the my drinks (coffee and club soda), she did it so much and w/o asking if I wanted another one that I left two full drink.  Advice, warn your server once your thirsts is quenched!  Overall a good experience, great service, and a decent food selection."}
{"text":"Service was good which is important. The crab spinach dip was good. The lobster tacos which are $18 were not edible. They were so salty. The server noticed we did not eat them and we told him the issue and he said he would take care of it. The bill came and there was no compensation. We paid for a meal we did not eat. If the lobster is bad and not fresh then say u don't have it available but don't try to scam your customers into buying it"}
{"text":"Goes down in history as one of me and my guy's favorite places with the best memories. What I appreciate most about this place, is how they maintain a somewhat peaceful ambiance compared to the rest of mill ave, even in the midst of the chaos!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for after dinner drinks with wifey. They have a good selection of brews and an overall cool place to hang out.  Didn't have a chance to check out the food menu. Place is worth a visit for drinks or just hanging out."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch ist eine Restaurant-Kette mit eigener Brauerei. Die Auswahl an unterschiedlichen Biersorten ist dementsprechend hoch.  Die Speisekarte führt viele Fleischgerichte, aber auch Salate, Pasta und Fisch. Dazu gibt es auch Ausgefallenes wie Curry.  Der Service ist schnell und freundlich  auch wenn die Frage nach schwarzem Tee verneint und daraufhin Earl Grey angeboten wurde."}
{"text":"I really like this place and have been there often.  I have always had good service, but have always sat in the bar area.  The food is good, needs a little more flavor....and is a bit over priced.  The happy hour is really good and has great prices."}
{"text":"My first visit to GB was at a happy hour (good value). I saw all the raves about the garlic fries here, so I tried the tapas and the garlic fries. The tapas was ok. The garlic fries were ok, if a bit soggy. Really, ravers about the garlic fries? Hmm. They were ok at best. That's just at the time of eating, never mind the aftermath. I totally love garlic, but these must've somehow had a powerful chemical reaction in me that caused really gross burps all night (the zombies and clowns weren't the only scary things at FrightDome that night!). Then when the garlicky farts started...ay carumba! Talk about gagsville! The next day, my husband called me Garlic Girl!  Maybe it was the combo of garlic fries with all the roasted garlic in the tapas.   I'll give GB another go, especially at happy hour prices but will avoid all things garlicky. Or maybe I'll just go to Kona Grill or Cheesecake Factory instead.   Summary: The service was good, the happy hour value was good. The food was meh."}
{"text":"Salmon and garlic mashed potatoes - sooooo good! This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Just giving an updated review cause they have their Winterbock menu now!!   Winterbock beer- great carmel chocolate flavor but ours were a little flat & not cold enough for me.  Chili- Impressive. very tasty & hearty.. a cup wasn't so small. shared it with my husband.  basic side salad- ordered this as my app & it's not so basic..lol. spiced pecans, tom, cucumber, cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese & jalepeno ranch!!! YuM yUm!  California Cobb flatbread- the fresh greens they tossed in balsamic vinegrette dressing then put on top, is what completes the taste of this flatbread.. must try. loved that they didn't use blue cheese!  We will be back to try some other items before they take their winter menu away :)"}
{"text":"Before this week I had never heard of Gordon Biersch.  My colleagues and I were in town for a convention all week and decided to stop by last Sunday night due to this restaurant being the closest place to eat. The food was pretty good the first night  but what made us come 3 of the.next 4 nights was extrodianary  service and pleasant conversation by a new server to Gordon Biersch, his name was Matt. When you go to this place ask for him he is the best server we have ever had in any state we have visited.  He told us he had just started there this month and we didn't believe him. His personality, knowledge of the menu and keen observance (remembered my order from the night before to the T even asked me if I wanted no tomatoes like the night before)made us feel he had been there for years. In the 7 nights we were in town we came to Gordon 4 of those nights and I had a Ribeye, French Dip Sliders, Grilled Steak Salad and a burger and they were all great.  I will definitely come back to this place next time I am in town. Thank you Gordon Biersch and Matt for the excellent dinners out in Arizona. See you soon."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and both times received excellent service and delicious food.  Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't received higher ratings on yelp!  My kids love it here and get the chicken fingers with fries and Oreo pie for dessert. My husband got a stir fry the first time we went and a bruschetta chicken dish (I think it was called Mediterranean Chicken) this time and LOVED both.  I got the California burger the first time...hands down the juiciest and best burger I've ever had!  The burger bun is delicious, too...very soft and fresh tasting.  This time I got the avocado chicken sandwich....soooo yummy!  Oh and I can't forget the GARLIC FRIES!  AWESOME!  Please give this place a try...great for families!!"}
{"text":"I think this chain is highly over rated.  The menu is high priced, service is fair and food is ok.  However the garlic fries are a great choice and the beer on taps are plentiful."}
{"text":"This is absolutely wonderful!!! The beer is great the food is wonderful!!! This is the best eating experience i have had in a long time! Absolutely fabulous!"}
{"text":"If you've lived in Vegas for any length of time you have probably been invited to join a group of coworkers for Happy Hour at Gordon Biersch at some point. I've been there countless times in the 9+ years I've lived here for going away parties, or just random group gatherings, but never gave much thought to the quality of the food. So when I was recently sent over there during the day for another work related item, the suggestion arose for me to take the opportunity and check out the burger. I can't say anyone has mentioned their burger to me throughout my time as 'burger blogger', so I was a bit skeptical by this idea but gladly took on the challenge as I always do.  There are two Biersch locations in town, the long standing one on Paradise near the airport, and a newer location in Summerlin. I actually haven't been to the one in Summerlin because there are far better selections in the area if I'm going to bother eating around there. The same could be said for the Paradise location, but it's probably the cheaper of the touristy selections around there. The exterior of the restaurant is still pretty cool, but the interior's 'brewery' look is starting to seem a bit dated. Whether you're there for lunch or dinner the place is always fairly populated between the close proximity to convention halls and hotels as well as the adjacent office parks. There are plenty of seats around the bar/lounge, as well as booths and tables both inside and out. The menu is all over the place with appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, desserts, you name it. While they may not offer the healthiest options, they do have a decent Happy Hour with a few good snacks.  While pondering which of their Knife & Fork Burgers to try the waitress suggested an off-the-menu but highly popular Swiss and mushroom burger, which also happens to be one of my favorites so I jumped on it. Served with a large knife skewered through it, the massive burger looked great upon arrival. The flaky, gooey bun was quite good and very well-proportioned to the meat. The patty seemed to be pre-formed, but of good quality; the char flavor was present upon the first few bites but got a little lost with everything else once I really got into it. The mushrooms had great flavor, and the Swiss was melted well but not incredibly present. Overall it was very juicy, flavorful, and a huge surprise.  Their 'legendary' fries are good, but actually a bit too garlicky for me. Also the whole batch was a bit undercooked and soggy so they weren't the best example that day. You get a huge portion, easily enough for two people if you're looking to share. $11.50 for this burger is a great deal considering its size, quality, large portion of fries, and proximity to convention-oriented hotels. While I hate spending $2.95 for an iced tea, $15.62 is still not a bad deal for everything you get. Swap that with a beer and you've got yourself a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 10 times. It is one of a few gastro pubs in the Scottsdale area and the food is consistently good.  Though their beer is actually brewed on the other side of town they have the usual GB beers and they are very well brewed representations of their respective styles. My favorite are the crisp Czech pils to start and then the roasty schwartzbier toward the end of the meal and desert. Some time after Thanksgiving they have a Seasonal Boch that is a wonderful malt bomb.  Some of my fellow beer nerds pan them for not having a hop bomb on the menu, but they are missing that Gordon Biersch does traditional German styles and they do them very well--all of them are lagers except the hefe and an altbier that I may have had seasonally."}
{"text":"Went here for fathers day, waited ten minutes before we were greeted. Had to send back mushroom burger because Roy was cooked at the wrong temperature and had a stale bun. Although the manger was very understanding to the situation and pod for the burger, it was an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Bad service. By bad I mean slow and unconcerned management. We walk in and they take 10 minutes for a server to show up. 35 minutes after placing the order I had to go looking for the manager to enquire about the food.  On being told that the period is beyond the restaurant waiting policy, they still charged us for the dishes.  And when you the food did arrive, the steak was burned and the mussels were not even cooked. This meant sending the food back and waiting for it to be cooked again.  Never coming back to the place for the food, maybe only for a beer. The two star is only for the beer."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch. Be sure to sit in the bar area for happy hour if you are dining between 3pm and 7pm or 9pm to closing. We didn't know this the first few times and could've saved on our appetizers. They have plenty of booths in this area as well, if you are like me and prefer a booth.   The blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich is bomb! If you've never been here or tried it, I definitely recommend ordering this sandwich. I literally order this with a side of garlic fries every single time I come here (and have my boyfriend order a new entree to try out haha). The presentation seems to always change and I have to admit the last one I got was a tad saltier than normal, but nevertheless it was still really good.   The Cajun pasta is flavorful and has a good amount of meat.   The Woodford Reserve bourbon salmon is also tasty. I prefer the sweet glaze on the side, though.   The calamari is lightly breaded and fried, which is nice. I like to dip mine in salt, pepper, and lemon juice.   The blue crab and artichoke dip is a good appetizer. I really like the crostinis they serve along side it. The only negative is that there isn't much crab in the dip.   Also try their sampler flight of beers! You can get six samplers for just over six dollars."}
{"text":"Poor service  Took so long to even get a water No napkins or silverware until I asked   Garlic fries tasted really regular too me Didn't live up to the hype  Gorgonzola pear salad was very splendid I highly suggest it. The pecan crusted chicken on top of it was on point Pears didnt seem fresh but everything else about it was good"}
{"text":"I would give this Gordon Biersch 4 stars. Mind you this is based on the greatest hour of the day. Happy Hour! The drinks are cheap & the so is the food. You can't really go wrong with any of their appetizers. My one complaint would be that their hosting service is not That great. To get a hold of My waiter/waitress can be pretty difficult At times. Why is it so hard for a girl to ask for another round? Other than that, the food is delicious and still worth going! There appetizers are delicious!"}
{"text":"Beer was great. Food was OK. Balcony seating was a bonus. The hostess was hurried and seemed to have better things to do, but the servers were pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Went there to meet several associates for dinner. While waiting for rest of party, 4 of us sat in the bar. Worst service possible. Excuse: \"We are really busy\" (5:30 on Thursday 5/14). Waited 15 minutes past our party being seated to finally get bill for the 4 bar drinks so we could join them. Food server better. Had a great chopped salad and split an undercooked, doughy pizza with spouse so the food was a wash. McCormick & Schmicks or Bahama Breeze next time for sure. Note to manager: Wake up G.B.! Lots of competition within walking distance."}
{"text":"Always have to check out a local brewery. While none of their beers really amazed me, the service and food did. I had a Kobe Burger, and while I still don't buy into the \"Ground\" Kobe hype, it was delicious. Their calamari was very solid!  Service was great start to finish!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was just ok. Maybe an off night? It was pretty empty when we came in and the service was painstakingly slow."}
{"text":"The food and beer is always great and Lori and Nicole are excellent  bartenders with super personalities. My favorite bar and grill in north Phoenix / Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was great to sit down w friends and have a tasty bite to eat. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing. Food and drinks were good but not on the cheap side....so don't expect to skate away for anything less than $60 or so for din din and a drink or two."}
{"text":"I first tried Gordon Biersch in San Diego and fell in love with the salmon caesar salad. Now I'm in Tempe and I have been to that location well over 10 times. I will go there for the salmon caesar, but will never stray from my usual order ever again. Unless it's just to pick up a quick order of garlic fries. Those are just yummy!  My friend who introduced me to the place has finally come up with what should be their slogan.... and after going through the latest experiences with them I might have to agree with her. \"Gordon Biersch. We'll just serve you what we want.\"  Let me explain based on my last dining excursion there. My last 3-4 have been about the same.  I arrive with my favorite carnivore who is also my best friend. We are seated promptly and receive our water with no wait. That's always good and they are good at doing this. She orders a burger as she has done for the last 3-4 times. She tells them she wants it medium. I told her she should have said rare because the last several times it came back well done. I strayed from my usual order of salmon caesar and ordered the crab cake sandwich. I asked her if she could substitute the lemon aioli for the tartar sauce, she said sure. I then asked if my garlic fries could be extra crispy and extra garlic and my friend said she didn't want hers that way. Waitress said no problem....  We get our orders. Burger? Well done again, not even close to medium. Fries for my friend? Extra crispy. Crab Sandwich? I had to ask her what the sauce was because it didn't look like the lemon aioli they serve with the appetizer and it didn't look like tartar sauce either. Her response? \"Oh that's our cajun sauce.\" WTH? No asking if I want it? Luckily, I was ok with it. My fries? I got my extra garlic, but they were a little soggy instead of extra crispy.  My friend and I were swapping fries.  We ordered dessert. Should have known better. They don't make their desserts there. That's apparent. The chocolate cake was really dry and their bread pudding was just disappointing (according to my friend). Thank heavens for the vanilla ice cream.... but I could pay much less at DQ.  I will continue to go there for the garlic fries because addicts need to get their fix too. I've learned not to stray from my usual order. Their salmon is never over salted, and always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This was my first Gorden Biersch experience, which is kinda funny, since the original in Palo Alto, only a few miles away from my home. I went here for lunch as a compromise with a friend who wanted to watch the New Year's Day bowl games.  We both saw the Pulled Pork Sandwich on the menu and decided it was the way to go. The sandwich came with a large serving of cole slaw and a mountain of pork with the top bun off to the side.  Unfortunately, the slaw was completely tasteless. I really don't understand this...how is it possible to have tasteless cole slaw? There was cabbage...there was some white-ish stuff...no taste.   The pulled pork itself was great, but had to eat some with a fork to make the bun usable."}
{"text":"Great for events!  I recently organized a Vegas bachelor party, and we held our big group dinner at Gordon Biersch.  I was able to work with the manager to put together a three course set menu for our group with enough options to make everyone happy (carnivores and vegetarians alike!). Additionally, we had our private dining room (the Marzen room), got to take a private tour of the brewery, and thoroughly enjoyed our two hour open bar!  Best of all, this VIP-style experience was reasonably priced (under $100 pp, including all taxes and tips!). Would highly recommend Gordon Biersch to anyone planning a large group dinner in las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food,was excellent as was the beer..liked the different glass sizes for the beer!..Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered food for take-out a few times (while visiting in Vegas), but I was disappointed every time. The quality and presentation of the food is bad. I have learned my lesson and I will never order food at Gordon Biersch again."}
{"text":"On three occasions I have visited this establishment. The first was good all around food seemed normal, I don't stray far from a hamburger so no surprise there.   The second time there was a little wait to get seated no big deal it seems like a pretty busy place.   The most recent time there was a fifteen minute wait for a table. The bar was empty so we waited there. HOWEVER upon further inspection (I looked around) the place seemed no busier than the first or second time, plenty of tables open, seemed strange to me. Well after a few beers we were seated at one of the open tables. Now by this time the bar was full so I suspect that I was a 'plant' to gather more people at the bar. My only concern had this been the case, is that I was not complimented for doing such a good job.  Oh and if you like wheat beers, their hefeweizen is is not half bad..."}
{"text":"Brought a party of 20 people there last night. Arrangements were made and confirmed on 1/12. We arrived on time and they were completely unprepared for us. Our server did a great job of attempting to keep up but that is an impossible task for one person. Among some of the worst dishes were the rare ahi that looked like an overcooked pork chop, a seafood dish that had salmon from a can and the obligatory missed order of fish tacos for one of my guests. Have been to Gordon Biersch many times around the country and this was pathetic."}
{"text":"I hate writing crappy reviews. I know some people relish it, I don't. Businesses are trying hard. Owners, staff and managers are trying hard.   But the food just wasn't NEAR what the Gordon Biersch quality used to be.   Calamari. Please, don't serve this. Literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading. Zero stars.   The famous garlic fries. Way over done and not nearly enough garlic! One star.   Southwestern rolls were yummy. Spicy and full of flavor. Four stars.   Flat bread pizza. Just a complete miss. Nothing artisan or quality or even ho hum about what came out. It was tiny and completely lacking any touch. Zero stars.   The ONLY reason I'm giving this experience two stars was because the server was doing his best to make up for really, really off food.   This is a complete plea with management. You have to review the food coming out of the kitchen as soon as possible. This is NOT Gordon Biersch quality at all!!!"}
{"text":"I gave Gordon Biersch 3 stars for their location and quality of brewed beer. I read some of the other reviews, and the theme is the same... not a great place, but a good location to view Mill Ave. from the balcony and some very good brewed beer.  Their second floor location is very cool. It's a good place to hang out if you've trolled up and down Mill Ave. and need to relax for a while.  Chrsty L. hit the nail on the head when she said she would never say \"Hey, let's go to Gordon Biersch tonight.\"  I wouldn't say that either.  Food is just o.k."}
{"text":"Got the chef special rib eye. Came with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Patrons were bland and soggy. No flavor. I ordered meat medium and it was med rare. Couldn't finish the potatoes. Green beans were dry and bland no flavor. Ordered a side of garlic fries, those were tasty. Beer was okay not too cold. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Even without comparing this location to the other (and the lesser) in the valley, I have to say that the level of service, quality and timeliness of food (not to mention presentation and attention to detail!) is impeccable. Every time.   The outdoor seating area (often neglected at other restaurants) is always clean, and my wife and I love sitting out by the fire with our dog. The staff (3 times, unprovoked) has asked if we would like a small tray of water for the dog. Above and beyond, each and every time.   The bartenders, Heather in particular, are super friendly, always accommodating, and always willing to chat without being invasive. Never a bad experience here."}
{"text":"After having visited their other location in Las Vegas, I was incredibly disappointed on many levels.   I had come to expect a certain level of service. I don't mean speed alone - I realize I visited on a Friday night and that it would be busy. But the staff was impersonal, uninterested, and acted as if they were getting paid $30/hr. no matter how they treated us.   The food, though I don't know how, didn't even compare to the other location. The signature garlic fries were soggy, rather than crisp, and the fresh parsley that usually tops the lot had apparently wilted under a heat lamp. Fresh chopped garlic was seemingly an afterthought (on GARLIC fries?), as it was unsoftened and spicy.  The turkey burger looked, tasted, and felt like leftover meatloaf. Not leftover from last night, but maybe last week. The fresh avocado was the only saving grace, though the steamed veggies on the side weren't hurting anything.  I don't usually give restaurants too hard of a time on the weekends, but the combined service, flavor (or lack of both) was offensive."}
{"text":"Seriously, the Bacon Cheeseburger with garlic fries is my ultimate meal.  The fries have garlic and Parmesan on them but they are crispy on the outside.  Do yourself a favor and skip the lettuce and tomato.   My wife loves the cedar plank salmon with pecans.."}
{"text":"After a long day if travel, I dragged myself in hoping for just a decent meal. I started with the House Salad with Jalapeno Ranch. Wow, kick and flavor! This \"basic\" salad had candied pecans, bacon and cheeses. Emboldened, I ordered the crab cake entree. Two decent sized crab cakes had so much lump meat that crab claws were poking out from all sides. I substituted asparagus for the garlic broccoli and got a nice amount of thin savory stalks. Jasmine rice was very mediocre but everything else was so great, I let it slide.   By the way, I'm not a huge beer drinker and the fresh lemonade was sweet and light!  Service was great, too. My waiter was upbeat and attentive.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went back a couple days ago and really enjoyed it this time. The beer was cold. The food was tasty and hot. And the waiter was very nice. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and decided to sit at the bar. He ordered a Hefeweizen and I ordered a sangria and then a cranberry and vodka. The drinks were great, and the beer was nice and cold. We ordered calamari from the happy hour menu and it was pretty good. Nice presentation and it came out quick. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to share and it was delish. The bartender was really nice and attentive even though she was busy. Will be back again. :)"}
{"text":"Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a \"signature\" cocktail and it tastes like garbage.   In this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass.   So you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space.   All in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer..    I left after the drink. You got me at \"hello?\" No, not so much."}
{"text":"Service is good,beer is great. We liked the blue crab and artichoke dip. The ribeye was less than great quality. Too thick and not much flavor,other than the gorgonzola on top. The ahi tuna salad was very blend. I remembered better food...."}
{"text":"The service from our waiter was quite good. He is the reason I gave GB more than one star. My wife and I went with my parents after a movie, hoping for a good meal. After spending 70 dollars on four entrees and 20 dollars on drinks, we got out after tax and tip for over 100 dollars. The food was flavorless, expensive, small portions, and boring. It was very disappointing. My dad ordered the lobster crab cakes, which came in a pair, and about two inches in diameter. The price on these were I believe over 20 dollars. I don't think I would go back, maybe just for reverse happy hour. Our server was the highlight of the evening."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little brewery located off of the strip with a better menu than its quality of food. All meals ordered at our table were rather small portions. I had a kobe beef burger with garlic fries it wasn't terrible or amazing, lacked flavor and could have used some seasoning.   I also had a hefeweizen which was pretty good. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to partake in any other alcoholic beverages.   I'd suggest this place to a group looking for a cool place to hang with good beer but not looking to snag an amazing meal."}
{"text":"We we're really looking forward to a great meal out, and craving Gordon Biersch. We have eaten here several times, and the Tempe location also and never been let down, until last week. The beer was great, we should have skipped the $50 dollars we spent on dinner! The fish was not medium it was overcooked and dry, the asparagus was tough we were so disappointed we won't be back for dinner again. The waitress was surly and I guess having a bad night. What a bummer!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 6 times. First 3 visits after opening the food and service was beyond excellent. Last visit was nothing short of ridiculous, we sat around 20 minutes before I had to get up and complain for lack of service. Food portions seemed to be skimmed down."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at Gordon Biersch in Scottsdale tonight.  Our server, Jacob, was great.  He was pleasant and attentive.  He met all our dining needs.  We really enjoyed our meals.  My husband had the BBQ burger and I had the California burger.  Our food arrived quickly and was hot and flavorful.  The garlic fries and regular fries were crispy and not greasy.  The weather was perfect for our patio dining experience.  Thank you, Jacob, for an awesome dining experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not really thrilled with this place.  I expected more of an interesting beer selection.  The food was good but nothing to rave about.  Our salads and entrees arrived back to back which I was not thrilled about.  The inside was nice and the staff friendly.  My husband and I agreed that it was not good enough to go back to."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place many years ago when they would have live reggae...back then the atmosphere was AMAZING & SO diverse.. You would never in a million years imagine the different types of people that were there...cowboys Rastafarians Hispanics African Americans Asian Americans i mean you name it & there was NEVER any bs nobody fighting or fussing it was really cool to see all these different types of people gathering at this place! I moved away for awhile and I moved back to Vegas..i came here the other night and I was very disappointed...everything changed...now i know that things can't stay the same forever but honestly this was a change for the worst...they got rid of Reggae night the bartenders are rude & Condescending it just over all sucked..i had 1 beer & then i left..i won't be coming back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Terrible plain food. Tastes like nothing. Had steak tips with bacon jelly. Was goulash soup, probably out of a can. Just sad. All that rep and no love. Don't waste your hard earned $ here."}
{"text":"I absolute loved the beer. The serviced sux though. I had the farmhouse burger which was really cheap and a large portion. My husband had the Colby burger. It was way more expensive and looked like a plain old back yard BBQ burger."}
{"text":"We live down the street from here and always go to their Happy Hour. Very good prices and great food! I tried the Baja Tacos and my boyfriend always gets the Seared Ahi. Services is always good and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"One of the few (only?) bar/restaurants in Summerlin that doesn't have video poker or smoking indoors. This does wonders for the vibe and atmosphere. GB is a relaxed, casual place that gets a good crowd for happy hour and weekends.  The happy hour crowd comes to take advantage of the great specials (from 5-7 and 9-close, I believe): $3 beers and $5 food. I've never thought GB's beer was the best in the world, but it's definitely respectable and a solid craft brew.   In a town dominated by strip malls, wide streets and parking lots, GB's outdoor patio is about as good as it gets for al fresco dining or drinking. One upside is the generally good people-watching, though."}
{"text":"Met the gf here for a light meal right after work on on Tuesday (last night). We sat in the high tables in the bar area during happy hour.  Staff: Waitress was nice, smiling and polite. She went along with some of the witty banter me and the lady were spewing. She was prompt and checked on us often, refiling the free bevs each pass.   Food: OK so maybe I am an Italian from NY and I have high expectations for pizza, however they did have a Margarita flat bread on the happy hour menu and figured it was worth on try. Turns out I should have held out for elsewhere. The 'flatbread' was more of a crispy communion wafer then actual bread. The ingredients on the top did not do it any justice either. We each got the harvest chicken salad (not be design, i was hoping to critique 2 dishes but it was exactly what I was craving (salad with chicken, pecans, raisins, apples, etc). It was actually a sizable portion and I ended taking some home. It was good, but not great. The dressing was lackluster, but the chicken was really good. Felt like maybe I should have found a chicken dish on its own and tried that  Ambiance: Actually has a good feel to it. Plenty of light and space - doesn't feel like you are in a hole of a bar like some of these places. Wasn't too busy (Tuesday early evening). But the bar was full by the time we left around 730  Happy hours - looks like a pretty decent deal, some cheap food, however I cant comment on quality as I only had the flatbread (see above food). Tuesdays they have $2.50 beers, just not specialty/bottled, so no cider for me ($5)  Overall - I like the feel in there, just wasn't big on the food. But the staff was nice and I feel like I will probably give it another go and try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"The beer at this place is very good. Happy Hour prices are reasonable and all tap beers are part of hh unlike other places. Food is good. Fish and chips is good."}
{"text":"I had the artichoke dip on garlic toast very flavorful! Nice environment for dancing and having a great time!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here and the beer is great.  Happy hour food was pretty good.  At another visit we had a hamburger and fries.  It would have been perfect except for THAT BUN!  OM-Gosh what a horrible bun."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Vegas!  I know it's a chain but it's just so good. My wife and I have eaten here dozens of times in the past year or so and never seem to get sick of it. Their menu is large and diverse enough that there's always something for whatever mood you are in. The food is always fresh and delicious, and the draft beer is out of this world. The Peach Tea is also refreshing on a hot day.  Favorite menu items---Southwest Eggroll Appetizer, Chicken Sandwich with sliced avocados, Flat Iron Steak, TACOS!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here often. The garlic fries and southwest egg rolls are my favorite but the waitstaff is hit or miss in my opinion"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected for a chain brew pub. We had excellent service and it wasn't too busy or too loud either. I had the BBQ pork sandwich and the Marzen BBQ sauce was so delicious. I love BBQ and this was definitely up there. My only complaint was that it came with coleslaw on it and the menu didn't say that it did. Kinda annoying because I had to scrape it off. Overall, very good and I will be checking out the CO location."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner on Friday, arrived around happy hour time. very busy, seated immediately. Waitress came by for a drink order, cosmopolitan's and one of their specialty on tap beers, my husband usually drinks Michelob Ultra Lite, waitress reminded him that it is happy hour on all of their beers so he did order her suggestion. I ordered a sirloin steak with mushroom sauce mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad, my husband had the Cajun pasta and a caesar salad. Salads came quickly, I unwrapped my silverware to notice they where dirty, thank God I had one clean fork in the bunch. when I went to grab the salt and pepper shakers they were almost empty and very sticky. Waitress came by, I pointed out my dirty silverware and sticky salt and pepper shakers. She apologized and took them away, came back with the same empty shakers but had wiped them off obviously not noticing that there was barely anything left in them, also noticed as we were sitting at the table how dirty the light fixture was at our table and the border around all the booths, had a half an inch of dust when the waitress returned with my silverware and salt and pepper shakers, I kind of pointed this out to her she just smiled and walked away with no comment. My husband enjoyed his Cajun  pasta I enjoyed my steak but I always do at most places it was nothing spectacular. bill was $64 with two drinks each two entrees  and salad, we came here based on the fact that it was the least crowded of the restaurants in the area. I am kind of understanding why, there was nothing spectacular about this visit, a lot of people here at this time with their children which I really don't care for, making it extra noisy. This restaurant clearly does not pay attention to details and it is something that is important to me. I hope they can improve this so we can have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"maybe I'm giving a bad review because I ordered stir fry at a place that clearly doesn't specialize in stir fry, however, if you have it on your menu it should be up to the standards of everything else.  The \"spicy\" chicken cashew stir fry was...1. not spicy, at all and 2. it was as good as the chicken terriyaki made by healthy choices that you can buy in the frozen foods section of the grocery store.  I'm ok with that for $5 like the healthy choices steamer, but I'm not ok with that for $15.   I tried the fries from my friends dish and those were ok.  From the rumors, I was expecting a lot of flavor, and didn't get much.  I ate the remainder because they were ok, but mostly because my stir fry was so small.  As far as burgers go, maybe they're good...I don't know.  But I won't be returning because the food I had was mediocre at best.  I've cooked better stir fry at home.  The waiter was great though!"}
{"text":"I joined my coworkers for Happy Hour here yesterday from 3:30 to 6pm.  Because I work a mile away, this is probably the 50th time I've had HH here but this is my first post - mostly because I always have too much fun at HH and always have a good experience, so the need to review slips my mind.  But finally, I am reviewing the place that has probably been able to pay their electric bills from my tabs.  Here's the real deal.  ONLY GO HERE FOR HAPPY HOUR!!  The HH is from 3-6pm (and from 10pm to close) and has great food specials.  Yesterday I had the Baja Tacos with a $7 happy hour price and it was the best $7 I have spent in years.  You get 4 fish tacos for the price and they were delicious!  The brews are $1 off, which isn't the best deal in town, but their HH food specials make up for the low beer discounts.  You can't go wrong with the garlic fries and the southwest egg rolls - ORDER THEM!!  They have space for merging tables for larger groups and have plenty of TV's for all the sports watching.  From a reviewer who has been here about 50 times, the 5th star is missing only because the service has been mediocre most of the time - sometimes because the happy hour is understaffed.  But once the beer and food arrive, it's definitely a 4-star place!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour, the beers were good but nothing to send home as you gotta visit this place.  Got the garlic fries, which were only $5.00 for happy hour. They were good, but again nothing too amazing about them, they were big enough to share though.   I would visit this place again, but only if it were a close option, wouldn't go out of my way to go there though!"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are ridiculous. We've been going for years and this new menu change for happy hour sucks. Never again"}
{"text":"Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.  It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.  I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.  I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).  Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Nice place, it took about 45 min for us to get seated and then another 50 min before our food came out"}
{"text":"I stopped by with some friends for dinner and I ended up having the sliders.  They were great!  I also had something call a Raspberry Ice Pick which was pretty good too, plenty of beer on tap and a very nice atmosphere for a date or just friends going out.  Great Place!"}
{"text":"It used to be great. We came in before the dinner rush for a family dinner for 8. Sat in the very sticky (seriously my shoes are still sticking to everything) bar area and ordered some drinks and apps before moving to our table. Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good, but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint.   One big thing that I couldn't help but notice when I walked up the stairs are all of the bins full of water surrounding the hostess podium, look up and there's major leaks coming from the ceiling...um, okay? We're not talking a waterfall, but definitely a steady stream of water pouring through different areas of the ceiling. No acknowledgment even when it was mentioned.  So we sit down and place our orders. I've been before and do credit the selection. It's 6:30 now on Thursday night and we are the only table. Based on the food, I can see why. Chicken sandwich was inedible. The chicken was stringy and old like the bacon, looked like it was reheated in microwave. The taste? There really wasn't much taste, just salty. The shredded lettuce was subpar to even Applebee's and the roll didn't help either. I filled up on garlic fries and after we paid and I ventured straight over to Silvermine for a real dinner.  The rest of my inlaws were mixed on their reviews of dishes (lobster Mac - okay, fish and chips - pretty good, steak tacos - no).  Overall, this place used to be nice, but food quality and atmosphere have taken a major tumble. I wouldn't be surprised if this spot is called something else next year."}
{"text":"steak frites drizzelled in mushroom sauce, garlic fries, appetizer fish tacos, even the chicken parm  well rounded food. good waiters!   Love eating here when im in town!   oh yeah, if you like beer they have lots or microbrew options for one to explore!"}
{"text":"The new menu and happy hour offerings are not up tp par. The beer is still good.  The pizza was the worst, and I don't mean it as a metaphor, a slab of ok pizza  crust with a ladle full, maybe 6 tbsp of sauce, and a palty amount to cheese, for 12.50! I have actually have had better pizza in cafeterias , for a lot less.I can only hope that they will see a decrease in revenue form their new menu and will revert to the old happy hour menu. Till then, it's for drinks only, if even that."}
{"text":"These guys are a great place for lunch or dinner.  I've gone to the one in Tempe and another one in Honolulu; Aloha Tower.  Where ever they are ... they do a great job!  I'm not a beer drinker .. just like their food.  However, my friends that drink beer seem to like that aspect as well. Lots of healthy choices though as well .. which is my gig .. normally.  They also have some decadent deserts ... if you feel the need to jack up your insulin count.  Love the location at San Tan.  It's close to where I live, work, and play.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise! We were a little hesitant based on the mixed reviews but so glad we gave it a try.  Delicious food, craft beer, and great vibe.  They need to  have a re-dedication to bring back the crowds. Beer infused mussels are amazing..."}
{"text":"I would just like to say the Ahi Tuna Steak I had was as good as it gets.  I have never had better.  I am a little nervous ordering something rare even though I like my steaks medium rare.  I was afraid it the tuna might be too close to raw.  It was perfect.  Not too rare and not over cooked.  Even the vegetables that were served were outstanding.  My wife's fish and chips were outstanding also.  They were very light and had just the right about of breading.  The prices are a bit high but if all the meals are this good, it is worth an extra dollar or two."}
{"text":"Everything is great here!  The beers are a must.  Happy hour proves to be the best time to go- the prices are cheap.  Otherwise, be prepared to spend about $25 per person if you're planning on having dinner with drinks.  I reccommend the pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent 4 p.m. meal with friends before the busy diiner hour on a Monday. We were seated in the dining room and served drinks right away. Wait staff was friendly, attentive, and efficient. The brown ale and homemade potato chips were a great way to start. The steak salad was delicious. The spinach greens were warm and steak cooked like I ordered and had a great flavor though I prefer a bit more tender.   The dressing was just right, good flavor and amount not overwhelming. My husband had the New York steak and said it was perfect. Highly recommend this spot. This is my 3rd visit here. Other times were during the busy dinner and post game times and service and food was just as good."}
{"text":"Outstanding service!!! Very friendly and knowledgable wait staff. Atmosphere was great. Had a poor experience at Kona and took our evening over to Gordon's. Salvaged our night with shots, quality cocktails, and appetizers. Should have started the evening here to begin with. Again, always an great experience here!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband brews his own beer so when we realized this restaurant was just across the street from our hotel we had to try it.  He said the beers were good, the food was excellent, the service was horrible.  The waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering.  Never returned for refills or to check up on us.  It was not crowded.  Only about 20 customers.  When we asked for the manager he seemed not to care about our comments"}
{"text":"Good service.  Lousy and expensive food.  Wife had Ahi salad, which was the size of an appetizer.  Burger was OK, but fries were limp and soggy.  Sent them back for cole slaw.  Two beers.  Bill $38. Should have gone to Yard House!"}
{"text":"I came here after work last week to have dinner with my sister, the food was really good and they have some nice specials.  There is a lot of seating in the bar area, including a few booths and high-top tables.  Our waitress was very helpful and explained the specials including in the happy hour specials.  I had the chicken tacos with mango salsa with strawberries, and rice and black beans on the side and a sommerbrau to wash it all down. The flavors were great and complimented each other.   Perfect!"}
{"text":"For starters, the food is amazing, but the reason I jumped on Yelp to leave a review is the amazing customer service. I just ordered fish and chips through a delivery service and when it arrived there was no tartar sauce. No big deal, the food was still fantastic without it. A few minutes go by and I get another knock on the door, it was the delivery guy again. He relayed the restaurants apologies for the inconvenience and handed me a bag with tartar sauce and a complimentary cheese cake. The cheese cake is greatly appreciated but what blows me away is that I never mentioned the sauce was missing. So someone at the restaurant realized after the fact that the sauce was forgotten and actively corrected the error rather than brush it off and hope I didn't notice. Five star food and five star service!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Have been here multiple times. Food and ambiance are great.   Yesterday we ordered Crispy Artichoke Hearts, Tapas and Taco chips [this is a bar option only]. We also ordered veggie pizza and fresh mozzarella pizza. All tasted yummy and these are the best veggie food I tasted in sometime!!! Their beer and long island iced tea also tasted awesome!  To top it all, our server Mr Nolan was so funny and friendly. It was as if we witnessed some classy stand up performance! Thanks Nolan! You were great!!!"}
{"text":"And that being generous   Food came out cold and the manager could care less just wanted to know if I wanted to order anything else.  ... Yes please bring me some more cold food ... I declined"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Kenny is an AMAZING manager and Natalia is the best server I've had in a long time. The staff and nice and kind and very helpful. They are amazing with their service and their food. I completely recommend this restaurant, it's worth the price. Trust me, go here!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER be going to this location again. Upon arrival for dinner in a dark parking lot I got out of my car and was shocked to see the outline of a person standing outside my door. For a second I was scared I was getting robbed, but she ended up giving some sob story and asking for money. It was embarrassing and disgusting but thankfully that was all she was doing, but I couldn't help but think if she was allowed to hang out here and approach their customers what about people with less reputable actions in mind? If there was more light or security patrolling the lot it would help. It really put horrible a mark on what was otherwise a decent meal here and I will never return. If you want a safe place to take your family or a date pick somewhere else. This location is not safe!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker but others in our party enjoyed the flights (the waitress even brought 2 extras each so they could sample the seasonals as well!)  We ordered a selection of appetizers in the bar early-mid afternoon to share and each one was more delicious than the last.  Great service, great food - no issues at all!  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, but small. Great happy hour specials, so-so service. Get there prior to 4p on Friday for patio seating during nice weather. Beer is great!"}
{"text":"I opened the door to Gordon Biersch on an afternoon recently and was met with about two dozen high school-aged children standing around, looking bored, with low music playing in the background.  I went to the bar and asked for a beer and was rudely told to leave. I stood around confusedly for a few moments, got the attention of another bartender, and was told that they weren't serving alcohol until later in the evening.  I turned around, walked down to Casey Moore's, had lunch, drank several beers, and wondered if I had hallucinated my Gordon Biersch experience."}
{"text":"I went for a happy hour fundraiser.  We really enjoyed the outdoor seating.  The wait staff was fantastic and kept bringing us free apps to try, which was much appreciated!  We didn't order any food but the tastings we had were delicious."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday before going to Lifetime Fitness. The artichoke hearts are delicious and the server, Nolan, was great. Going again in an hour when I get off work! Great selection of drinks. Wine was delicious, served at the perfect temperature. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Food is good, their own beer is good, price is very good, we order from the small plates menu. Ahi Wonton Nachos are excellent and daughter loves the Prosciutto Gorgonzola Chips. Wedge Salad was perfect as well. What stood out was Jason on 11/16/16. Dude was on fire! Super fast service, waters never were less than 1/2 full and everything came quick and no nonsense! Love that kind of service!  The only reason is not great is the daughter dropped her cell phone between the booth seat and the wall and used my phone as flashlight, she said it was \"disgusting down there\"... full booth break down guys.. :)  Thanks, Les"}
{"text":"This place sucks! It's over priced and the food is not fresh. I got the Kobe sliders and they came out burnt. I even ask them to cook them medium and they said they can't, it doesn't come that way? So maybe they are frozen? I don't know. All I know is this place does not have good food or service."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is good, but our waitress didn't seem to want to take our order for over 20 minutes, but the beer selection is great. Unfortunately our waitress doesn't seem to be in the mood to wait on her customers, lots of knats outside too, but that's the nature of the beast when eating outside. Has the bones of a great place, just our wait staff wasn't on point."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It brews it's own beer; which rocks my world! Their pizza is Amazeballs! Also, I really dig the ahi tuna salad is great! Such a fantastically accommodating place too! They host Running For Brews every Tuesday! Great staff! Quick service!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. i order pizza at traditional pizzerias and then wish it was more like the pizza i've gotten from here. bad taste on my part? i don't know, and i don't care because i like it...Unfortunately, i haven't tried most of the menu otherwise.  in terms of the pizza alone i'm happy to give this place at least 4 stars. the crust is good (chewy but crisp and not too thick or thin), there is neither too much nor too little cheese, and the toppings are flavorful. my favorite pizza is the vegetarian. it's topped with a small assortment of  veggies and fresh spinach (raw), with what seems to be a little sprinkle of viniagrette. yum. of course, their beer is good, especially the hefeweizen. i'm not a huge fan of the corporate atmosphere, but the pizza helps me forgive that relative flaw."}
{"text":"In the entry area they display German mugs from the Oktoberfest (standard size is a bit less than 1 Quart) and you can order one upon request. I am weighing 270 pounds and in Germany I drink two to three of them - if filled with light beer with less than 5% alcohol - before reaching the 0.08 legal limit. See BAC calculators online.  Unfortunately the waiter refused to serve the stein, he only offered to serve 1 pint or 12/16 oz. No problem: I ordered two of them and had what I want. Unfortunately the waiter refused to serve two.   I asked for the manager and he supported the waiter. They serve only one single glass and AFTER IT IS EMPTY they check if you appear drunk or not and then they make a decision about serving the second one. They claim they offer german food and german beer and they even have a \"Stein-Club\" where you get points for your order. I was speechless.  I offered to order two beers, one for me, and one for my wife. The manager explained that if they see her NOT drinking the second beer but catching me drinking it myself they would ask me to leave. I had to agree but knew what was coming:  When I was half through my meal, had finished the beer by then and ordered the second one it took them nearly 10 minutes to bring it. My dinner was cold by then.  Similar experiences I made in the former communist occupied part of Germany.  I made the decision to stay away from the joint as far as possible in the future."}
{"text":"We love the food here. That's definitely not the problem. Today we came in at 12:30... smack dab in the middle of the lunch rush. The restaurant has 2 servers and a bartender on for the entire place. There are 5 tables total. We waited 5 minutes in the bar to get greeted. Nobody ever came over. Got frustrated and moved to the dining room and waited 6 more minutes to be greeted. 11 minutes before even being addressed/getting drinks? Ridiculous. This happens all the time here, but we keep coming back because they have the best Crab and Artichoke dip ever. The dip might not save them anymore, though, because we're getting pretty sick of the crappy service."}
{"text":"I recently went to GB on a Tuesday night with some friends for a drink or two around 8 pm. The place was not busy at all. There were only a few patrons here. The place was a ghost town.   We sat down in the cocktail area and waited and waited for someone to come over to take our order. Nobody ever came. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes, we left. The hostess in the stairway was shocked we were leaving so soon.. We told her why.  I can understand a wait when the place is busy, but when there is almost nobody there, this is inexcusable!  I really liked going to GB, but this night GB was subpar."}
{"text":"Went with a small group and most of us ordered the Kobe burger. The consensus was that it was one of the best burgers in town. The garlic fries were tasty, but a little too salty for me. The Czech Pilsner was great and the service was fine."}
{"text":"Good service great food Kobe burger awesome also manager was very professional very good awesome place to go before the game"}
{"text":"The hostess was nice as can be but the wait staff never came to even take a drink order. We sat at a cruddy table for 20 minutes before deciding to leave. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Food: really good although a little too much garlic for my taste. It might have been an off day, but every time we drive by I smell nothing but garlic. Wide selection and prepared well.  Price: good for the quality that comes on the plate.  Service: we went in during down time so we were literally waited on hand and foot."}
{"text":"This mega-chain brewery is nothing to call home about. If you want a cool brewery head to Four Peaks -- that's where it's at! Gordon Biersch is stuffy, over-priced and the servers have attitude. The food is mediocre considering the prices and the bar is ho-hum. The highlight? The second floor balcony, which is fun for people watching."}
{"text":"Sat for well over 45 minutes and was Not waited on. The only thing we received was a table and menus. My date and myself left ND on our way out the door, servers were just standing around talking to each other. There would have been plenty of opportunity for us to be waited on and served. And when asked we were told that someone would be there shortly, well whoever \"someone\" was must have gotten lost on the way to our table.."}
{"text":"if i could give this place less than one star i would.  this place was horrible. i had a habenjero burger - i think they mixed the pepper with garlic. it wasn't spicy at all. the fries are also coated in garlic and ... i ate a good lot of them because they were bareable, but they were pretty damn gross. the house beers are lame.  it was WAY over priced for food that didn't deserve to be on a Chili's menu.  just please. go somewhere else.  also, my girlfriend had a martini and there was a pit in the olive... that was a bit startling.. so, if you DO go, be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Bistro steak is so delicious & juicy.  Lobster & crab cake is amazing.. Love this place. Very nice service! Enjoy the great beer and some Starter dishes! Absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times when I lived in this part of Vegas. It's consistently good and the service is friendly. A few times my order was confused, but the service was quick to fix it. It's a relaxing place to go with some friends to just chat and hang out."}
{"text":"Derek must be off his rocker. Expensive happy hour? A good percentage of the liquor in their specialty cocktails is premium. Most bars I've worked at charge roughly $12 for premium liquor to start, an extra $2 bump for rocks, martinis or doubles. I typically go for their margaritas, which are a double pour, and they're only $5 on happy hour. WINNING. I always have a pleasant head change after ponying up to the bar during happy hour or watching the game. As for the food, I've always been a fan, even before I became more of a happy hour patron. When I do dinner here, tataki salad is awesome, pastas and steaks rock, and the side veggies always get destroyed. Long story short, I've never not left here feeling fat and happy. As for the yelpers who wanna complain the the fried foor doesn't have a prettyu presentation... are you gonna mount it and hang it on your wall, or eat it? Seriously... I can't ever recall the girl bartenders name that's usually working when we come in, all I know is she's a Chargers fan. Anyway, props to her, always above and beyond service. Love GB."}
{"text":"This is the only GB that I have been too so I can't compare it to another one.  My wife and I have gone to this GB many times.  Their food, beer, and service are good.  This place has a nice atmosphere and sometimes hard to get a seat at.  The only downside to this place is the price, it can be a little expensive.   Overall, I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Good jambalaya, beer isn't the best in the world but it's a good atmosphere and good location in Boca Park."}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Tempe, which is typically pretty good. This one was terrible. We ordered the \"pot stickers\"... supposedly precooked and then pan fried. I will tell you that the chicken was raw and the dough was chewy. We made one complaint, and the waitress assured us that they were \"cooked.\" Then after cutting into another, the chicken continued to be under done and pink. We sent those back, and waited at least another 20 minutes for our main meal. That was just mediocre -The Southwest Chicken sandwich.   Will say the beer was good as usual."}
{"text":"My husband had the steak sandwich and said it was good.  I tasted his garlic fries and they did,t have much flavor,but most of all were not real hot and not crispy, Just a kind of hardness.  Nothing to look at or tempt me to eat more. I had the Kobe burger and will never have another. It looked hard and dark and was not juicy at all.  Maybe a burger  really should have some fat or they don't know what they are doing .  I never use ketchup, but had to drown this burger in it for some flavor.  Yuk! I so wish I would have sent it back, but our server was so nice.  This place is over priced and could take a lesson from Cheesecake Factory where everything is consistently GOOD.     Thank God we had a birthday coupon and got a break on the bill.  Free chocolate cake that was not moist except for the frosting.  Will never go back.    We don't care about the beer."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food on a Wednesday evening.   We will probably be back on Friday before we leave town."}
{"text":"Eek, this rating is tough because finding hair in your food just isn't A-OK, however the manager's way of handling it was A-OK! Shelly took time to come out and personally apologize. She also explained their policy in which all the kitchen staff wear hair nets. She also said she talked to the head cook and showed him exhibit A so that he could talk to the rest of them and make them aware. Although my friend and I had only ordered 2 apps, Shelly took care of both so we ended up only paying for our drinks.   A little bummed about the experience because the service was good and worth going back for."}
{"text":"It's by far the worst service I ever had in any restaurant. It took about 15 minutes to get our appetizers and then we sat there, and sat there and sat some more.1 hour past and they supposedly lost our ticket.  I would be happy to tell you the food was good or bad but , we never got it.  We left at an hour and 20 minutes   The manager is spineless ,never came out and said 1 word. The waitress said the appetizers were on the house    Definitely not letting this go and will be all over corporate come Monday morning.   I would suggest closing the doors"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I've always had great or decent service. The garlic fries come with the meals as are very tasty. I normally order a burger (super tasty) but the reason I gave 4 stars is that the menu may be slightly overpriced in my opinion. There is a nice patio area and bar inside. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"From start to end this place was awesome! We stayed at the La Quinta and asked for a pet friendly patio nearby. They suggested this wonderful restaurant and brewery right across the street. Service was a delight. Monet was attentive, professional and friendly. She even gave our dog a dish of water. We got a flight just for fun, there were a couple gems and a couple that were not! We ordered the California Cobb flatbread and Cajun pasta. Both were packed with flavor and prepared with love - so delicious! We also got a bottle of villa Maria sauv blanc, which was refreshing and reasonably priced. Overall, great experience and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for business meetings or when guests are in town. Service is always quick and friendly (and sometimes funny!) and the food is great. I love the salmon and the kobe beef burgers."}
{"text":"It's ok, bit expensive for bar food. Only have house beer which was fine 20 years ago, but today need a better selection i.e. Green Flash IPA  Happy hour is tough to beat, $4.for a quality beer, usual suspects for eats. As an afternoon visitor I'm impressed by the female bartenders, upbeat and remember your favorite beer, especially the longest serving one. Male bartender not so much."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing in-house beers, service has been spot on every time I've been here. I love the patio seating, great perch to people watch. Definitely one of my top three favorite places in Tempe.  The menu is beautiful and has something for everyone no matter their tastes. The bar is well stocked and the bartenders really know their mixology from what I've experienced there.   Ranging from their appetizers to desserts, their house made beers, the service and the casual yet refined atmosphere, I will definitely be returning here many times. Great job guys, you've earned your 5 stars from this customer!"}
{"text":"This place is all hype. The only thing that is well done is their apps. Their food was cold and over priced. I was there for a large party, and the service sucked! They got orders wrong and we ended up waiting for a long period of time for the right order."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. We stopped here for pre dinner drinks and ordered some appetizers and beers. The food was what you expected, hearty pub fare. You have plenty of beers and other drinks to chose from and the staff was friendly and attentaive."}
{"text":"We are weekly customers and I ask myself why. They do have an OK Happy Hour the food is so so and pricey. The beer is tasty and usually on.  If you stick to the hamburgers or BB pork your OK. The service is good or bad. Don't bother complaining to the manager, (the one from Tennessee) it will not matter.  He cant handle any negatively or suggestions so don't waste your time. Yes, its time for a new place."}
{"text":"Came back from finishing my last final wanting to celebrate by ordering a steak from somewhere so I gave this place a try and ordered a well done steak. Upon getting back to my dorm I pull out my order to see it RARE... now me being in a dorm I don't have anything to cook it with so guess who just wasted $25 freaking dollars, THIS GUY. Pretty inconsiderate that this was NO WHERE CLOSE to being well done, sorry I'm not a vampire and don't want food poisoning... I'm aware restaurants usually give you the worst piece of steak when you order well done but this is unacceptable, guess who's never giving this place another dollar"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience and service at this location. This is the 3rd time that I have visited this location and it has not been good. I am a loyal Gordon Biersch customer. The Santan Mall location is where I typically go and the service is amazing! When I compare the two locations I can't believe they are the same company."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?? Still has good beer but DO NOT eat the food! I ordered the chicken skewers and my husband ordered the bratwurst sliders both were nasty. Most of my skewer dish was cold and the areas that were not were luke warm... omg the chicken, not one piece was edible. :(   The bratwurst looked so yummy! Truly nothing to wrong with these but overall just not good, at least they were warm enough though! I'm sorry to be so negative here but one last thing... FLYS EVERYWHERE! Look away from your glass of beer for a couple seconds and 3 or 4 are sitting on the rim, yuck! Will not be back :("}
{"text":"Food's ok, love the drinks though. It's more of a sports bar feel."}
{"text":"Beer is good, chefs favourites not worth anything, service only got good toward the end when they were trying to push me out. One day for the beer"}
{"text":"Very good pepperoni pizza.  Big burger.  Good,friendly server"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere...wasnt crazy about the food...nor was anyone in my party. The area on mill st. was fun."}
{"text":"We frequent GB's 2-3 x a month. We like the beer selection, even better this past year with more rotational selections. The food is always solid and the service is generally very good. Happy hour is generally when we go. They have plenty of email specials if you sign up for the reward program. The Marzen is our favorite but the Hef is very good as well"}
{"text":"We stayed across the street and happened in on this spot. The food was good but what really made the meal was the atmosphere. The menu offers a variety of food too. They had live music and a lively dance floor. Superfun band! There was a big local crowd dressed to the nines which  made for great people watching. On too of it all, it is very affordable!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am a fan of this place.  It is a standard visit for me when in the Phoenix area.  First, it is great to sit out on the deck, and watch the human traffic on Mill.  Come on.. it's ASU!  the beer is great, but they need some more hoppy beers, kind of lacking there.  Had the tuna starter, then some other, non-descript salad.  the tuna was like candy.  Fantastic. Salad and beer was above average, but not 5-star.  Will always stop through here."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here for years.  Over the past year the food has really gone downhill.  Service was friendly but so-so.  Food has turned into a cross between tv dinners and Denny's quality.  Happened the last three times.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Grilled ahi was flavorless, but cooked as requested.  Boring rice and carrots on side.  All for $17.    Service slow.  Attractive, friendly waitress was sweet but rarely seen and seemed to mostly ignore our near-corner table.  For example: 17 minutes between collecting tab and returning credit card.  Had to hunt her down and ask for it.  Homebrew Beer was exellent."}
{"text":"Great menu, great beer. Great place to land while waiting the TWO HOURS for the parking lots to start moving after the game."}
{"text":"This is a good place to sit back and relax. Overlooking mill avenue, you can sit on the 2nd floor patio and enjoy a cold beer and some tasty garlic fries either on a visit to Tempe or after work and class."}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude!  Stay away from this place before any ASU Sporting events!  Waiting time is extreme and there are empty tables all around!  We had to wait 45 minutes for a table in the bar, when people were just walking in and sitting at empty tables!  The manager, Matt B, was no help!  Ordered appetizers and dinner, and only were able to eat the appetizers, quickly because our meals were not ready - after 45 minutes!!  Loved this place last season, not sure why they cannot handle crowds this year!  There are many  choices in Tempe!  This is no longer one of ours!"}
{"text":"I stopped in while I was in town for the CES convention recently.  Good food, good beer and good atmosphere.  They have plenty of parking and it is conveniently located just off Paradise.  It was a good place to regroup and relax after a long day of walking the convention floor."}
{"text":"Great ambiance... Great service... However, the food fell a little short... While the salmon was an excellent dish, the NY Strip fell short... The steak was dry and overcooked, and the shrimp were fishy and undercooked... For the price point, it was a bit disappointing..."}
{"text":"First time here for a party off 2 after passing many times on mill. We were seated outside, given our menus and that was it. We waited 15 minutes and still not even  water. We left, made sure the manager knew. They offered a free meal, but it's not fun eating your food when you know the restaurant knows they messed up."}
{"text":"Service awful, people seem to be deaf here, no smile and unwilling to accommodate sittings when not even half of the space is occupied."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my husband  he had a beer which he said was great and an awful tasteless burger  I had a salad also tasteless  Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"We have been Stein Club members for years and have had really positive experiences in the past with Gordon Biersch.  We have attended Stein Club and Passport parties as well as classes with Brewmaster Lovelady.  We loved all that.  Unfortunately, all good things apparently must come to an end.  We have noticed a decline in the quality of service, food and beer over the past year or so.  We have visited less and less because of it.  Tonight may be the last night we ever go there.  The food was terrible.  We had appetizers which were featured.  The fried onion stack tasted worse than fried onions in a can .. like they were triple dropped in the fryer.  There was no onion in there at all as far as I could tell...  the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.  They were tasteless and smelled like old beef.  The brats were tasteless.  The pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and that's not saying much.  Even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.  We have always loved the beer but this evening, even the beer was bad.  The Maibock was flat and tasted turned.  The Pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.  Happy Hour prices for beer went up and no one informed us of that.  We complained to the manager who pretended to care and do something or another on the register but when it came time to pay the bill... which took forever to get.... nothing had been done to compensate us for the terrible service, terrible beer and terrible food.  It was abysmal in every possible way.  We have always been good customers and good tippers.  They have lost good customers tonight.  If this was the first time, we might have ignored one bad experience but, this has been a long time coming over the past year or so.  Sorry.  No more.  Or No Mas."}
{"text":"My husband read that this was a brewery so we had to try it. Arriving we were told it was happy hour but we could only have happy hour in the bar section. I was a little leery of sitting at the  for fear of noise but I was surprised that we could hold a conversation. We tried the beer sampler (which I recommend anyone who has never been here) and there is not a beer I wouldn't order.  My husband had the cashew chicken and I had the chicken/shrimp combo, the flavors had us debating who got the better meal. More importantly I feel that they did not skimp in meat like so many restaurants do  If there was one slight negative, I would have to say the bar was definitely backed up which didn't make sense since there we not many costumers in the restaurant. However weighing that against the positives of the night we will surely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for lunch. Had to place our order with another server, as ours took so long to return. He got a burger and I got the chicken with bourbon sauce. He ordered a burger medium-rare, it was overcooked. The chicken with a bourbon sauce was almost too salty to eat. The best thing on my plate was the quinoa and  kale salad. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We love Gordon Biersch from our LA digs back in Burbank. We got seated and it took the server over 10 minutes to greet us and 10 minutes to bring waters over. Then we had trouble getting our order placed. Food took awhile and with 3 kids seems even longer. Food wasn't as good as we know it to be back home. Garlic fries barely had garlic and there was the smallest serving ever. I'm sad that this is the location we live by now. Hostess staff seemed on top of it as she was getting concerned we weren't being helped for drinks and she went and told the manager who did nothing. Props to the young lady that was better equipped to see the issues then the actual person paid to do so.  Signed no longer a fan."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel including numerous airport related delays I checked in to my hotel and walked over to GB. I found a great table, ordered an ice tea and some of their Tex-Mex spring rolls. Wow. The day ended much better than it had been to that point. Overall a great experience. Superb atmosphere and a great place to catch a game with well placed TVs."}
{"text":"Had a company dinner here in their side private room.  Justin and Kenny are amazing to work with, servers were friendly and fast, food was yummy!  The private room has direct access to the patio.  The side room is recommended for parties of 40 or less.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"All American food, the beer was great the Moroccan salmon was ok the white Rice was more like an oatmeal really bad! and the service was less than the average  Since I had better past experience in this restaurant I'll be back"}
{"text":"I love the outdoor patio on a beautiful spring day!  The quality of the food was very good.  And the microbrews are also great.  There is a sports bar atmosphere inside with plenty of tvs.  Service was excellent.  I would recommend this as a great walking destination off the strip."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and the food is good... service is pretty good... but nothing is extraordinary. I know they have some fiercely loyal fans... but I just can't figure out how they can charge twice as much as similar places and still seem busy?  I will admit... the fish tacos are really, really good though. they would get another start form me if their prices were more in check with similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Just ok. Fish tacos were wrapped in tortillas too hard to eat. Sent back and not much improvement.  Wouldn't go back to this location. Chopped salad was good. Cole slaw was too spicy. Best dish was the Cajun pasta was stellar. Service was great."}
{"text":"Food was ok, except for the Lobster Bisque which came out cold.   Service was poor, food was delivered to the table we had to get dishes and utensils ourselves.    Manager was obnoxious and acted flip about the problems with service.  Would not recommend this restaurant at all until they get new staff."}
{"text":"Excellent bacon blue burger! Order it! And order a Hefeweizen with it and you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times the food and service was excellent. Their pizzas are very good and I'd agree with everyone on the garlic fires and onion strings. Good stuff!  My only disappointment was on the second visit when our server brought us our change but did not bring us our coins. Instead he pocketed our $.30 - yes it's not much but it's the principal of the thing...give the correct change!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight with the expectation of a good family meal but was highly disappointed. We ordered Mac and cheese for my 3 year old and it was brought out very hot. I randomly tasted it before my daughter and I burned my tongue on the hot spoon! I'm so glad that she didn't eat it first. The spoon was brought out in the hot microwaved bowl, it should be served on the side.   My husband talked to the manager after asking to speak to him a second time and the manager was less than polite basically insinuating that I lied about having my tongue burned! This was terrible customer service. They didn't even try to resolve our issue or offer for us not to pay for her meal. We will never be back. Which is sad, we've had great experiences at the location in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere with plenty of staff for a pleasant lunch.    We started with one of their seasonal appetizers,  the Fish Taquitos were delicious.  Served with a drizzle of sour cream, guacamole and a tomato / pepper dip.  I had the Blackened Mahi mahi sandwich and my date had the Chicken and Avocado sandwich.  Both were delicious served with garlic fries.  In some cases I have found garlic fries to be overpowering but these were lightly seasoned and delicious.  The restaurant is about 3/4 of a mile from the strip, a walk that does well to work up an appetite or work off part of a meal.  As a micro-brew fan, I look forward to trying other Gordon Biersch locations."}
{"text":"I ordered a Kobe beef hamburger, roughly $14.00, and my son had a regular cheeseburger. Both of us ordered our burgers medium...they came to our table well done. I cannot, in good conscience, give a good review of the food, burgers are extremely easy to cook. The waitstaff, on the other hand, was very accomodating. They took the burgers off our bill, after offering to remake them. We did not take our disappointment out on the server, not her fault. But the kitchen staff should understand it was their mistake, and the server had to hear the complaint. Kudos to our waitress, never will I order a burger from this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our trip to Las Vegas and so happy to see Andy's smiling face!!! Andy is the best bartender Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning off a simple Caesar salad. Worst food poisoning I've ever seen. When my boyfriend called to inform the manager he didn't seem to care and told us he would get back to us but didn't. I work on mill and will never be back. If you do go, don't get a salad."}
{"text":"I love this place! We come here a lot. Great food and drinks. They may consider more staff but the people they have are awesome!"}
{"text":"Pasta primavera was drowning in a pool of sauce that actually hurt your mouth to try to eat. Highlighted it to the server who nodded understandingly but didn't do anything about it. Service was also extremely slow. However the beer was good as usual."}
{"text":"Friggin Delicious!   First time me and my sales manager were in the Mill street area and walked through a few places to eat before deciding this place was for us. We walked upstairs and sat down at the bar. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable.   I asked what beer i should drink and he placed a delicious ale in front of me. The decor is a sports bar theme with a view of the town. The patrons were a good mix of young and middle aged people. We got to talking with people at the bar and everyone seemed friendly.   We both ordered the Lobster and Shrimp tacos since they were highly recommended to us by the bartender. And these were the best fish tacos i have ever eaten! Fresh, meaty and cheesy delicious. I will be back as soon as I can. If your in the area, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Gordon B! One of my Top 5 favorite Las Vegas restaurants. Always hot and delicious with great service in a nice atmosphere.  Great for hanging with friends or date night. This place works for all occasions. A+."}
{"text":"We were in Westgate and then decided to try out dinner at this place after checking out the reviews of the neighbouring restaurants. The menu looked appealing and we were not disappointed by the quality and quantity of the food. We started with Asian Chicken bites and calamari. The chicken were popcorn sized bites which sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and had a sweet sauce like thing to dip in. The sauce complimented the bites. But the spicy lemon remoulade which came with calamari was amazing. Our server Mini was kind enough to get me another serving of this tangy dipping when I licked my first bowl clean. Next we ordered our entrée. My husband had the California chicken sandwich which came with a generous serving of GB's famous garlic fries and I had a Greek flat bread. We also ordered a side of chicken BBQ slider. Personally I didn't like the BBQ sauce as it was sweet but the slider bun was soft. The sandwich was big enough for one person after sharing the appetizers and slider so we shared the sandwich and had the flat bread packed. Overall we were quite satisfied with the service and the food provided. We sure will be back to try out some more of their delicious menu."}
{"text":"The food is okay but over-priced.  I was astonished to pay 9 dollars for an appetizer that literally had only 4 bites of food.  My salad was something I could have had for less somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the best brewed beer I have ever had. I love the rooftop atmosphere. It's perfect when your casually dressed. Service was great too."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on Sunday late afternoon after a movie at the AMC.  I've driven by here many times and was always curious.  I love a good brewery.  Usually the food is good in breweries as well...but not here.  I should have paid closer attention to the 3 star rating on Yelp!  Yikes...  It was cool and raining outside so we both ordered the Lobster Bisque...it was really nasty.  It was very slimy and mucusy tasting.  We were served bread, it's a kind of flat bread that is usually served with herbs and oil, but this bread was cold and served with cold hard butter.  It wasn't very tasty.  My companion ordered a chicken sandwich with the garlic fries...I ordered the daily special for a hamburger and garlic fries.  Both sandwiches were mediocre at best. Honestly it's a tastier hamburger at Sonic.  I didn't taste the fries because by this time I was just disgusted at the whole meal.  On the plus side, our server was very good as was the beer. Unfortunately for our server she made the mistake of asking if everything was good.  Now I wouldn't have ever said anything if she hadn't asked, I would have just left and never went back. But she asked and I told her how it just wasn't very good.  She did everything she could to make amends, offering us free dessert etc.    We weren't there to take advantage or to try and get a discounted meal, it truly wasn't good and I truly won't go back."}
{"text":"After being ignored for 10 minutes at Thirsty Lion, we wandered down to Gordon Biersch. Great decision! Excellent service, nice menu, yummie food, nice tap selection. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We had the salmon.  The veggies were decent but the salmon was way too salty, dry, and very little taste, other than salt.  Probably should've gone for the burger or steak, probably better odds at a brewery."}
{"text":"12/28/11 We were staying at the LaQuinta Inn across the street and had a 10% off food coupon. Even without a coupon this place is worth it.  We went early, 4:00ish but not for Happy Hour. Not busy at all, nice and quiet. Our waiter Julio was  adorable, helpful and attentive.  I had the beer tasting sampler. 7 of their beers; all but two were great. My husband did not care for his Schwartzbier, too light in flavor and color. The Czech Pilsener was our favorite.  Now for the food... My husband had the bone-in Ribeye which melted in your mouth. He said it was second only to Joe's Crab Prime Steak and Seafood at Caesar's. I had Calamari appetizer, so-so, but the wasabi sauce was great. Then I had the Lobster and Crab cake appetizer. Flavorful lobster and crab and lots of it, no fancy spices or fillers. I don't know how they managed to hold it together. With that I had the lettuce wedge salad, also huge, and the best blue cheese dressing I have had in a restaurant. Lots of bacon crumbles and blue cheese chunks as well. Finally, we each had a mini dessert. Strawberry cheesecake and warm apple bread pudding. No restaurant has impressed us this much in a looooong time! We may even go back again tomorrow on our way out of town."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Great self brewed beer! Staff is very knowledgeable about the beer and the food. Ahi Tuma was cooked to perfection. You would think it was an East Coast seafood joint. Garlic fries are a must - be sure to ask for ranch dressing to dip them in."}
{"text":"We usually really like this restaurant but DO NOT order the street taco appetizer! For $9.95 you get 4 mini corn tortilla with 1 or 2 matchstick size pieces of steak, in fact one taco only had one matchstick piece. If you go here for lunch stick to the burgers or Pizzas."}
{"text":"Went in shortly after lunch on a Sunday, were pleasantly suprised to find that a live band performs here around 1-2pm on Sunday's.  Unpleasantly suprised to find a bus arrive shortly after we did with a group of 20-30 go into the building.  Hence when we finally got our seats (maybe 20-30 minutes later), it was a LONG wait for the food to arrive.  The food was decent but not spectacular.  Considering the other choices available in the immediate area and the cost involved, I would be hesitant to return unless invited.  The beer is excellent here so come for that, not the food (except for the Garlic Fries!).  Go to Hard Rock, Firefly, Bahama Breeze or Ellis Island...all are within 5 minutes of here and are either better in food or cheaper (such as Ellis Island which has it's own beer, too, and the $7 dinner nightly)."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this location. I had never been here and I tend to be a lil picky. I asked for modifications, the waitress was accommodating and sent the manager over to double check. The manager was also very accommodating, personable, and we had a nice conversation. This place doesn't serve just your typical bar food, although its available, everything was very good. I will definitely be coming back, even if just for the incredible service."}
{"text":"This location is terrible.  Tables empty and we have been waiting over 20 minutes. They said they didn't schedule enough servers.  Really? During lunch tinge the day before Thanksgiving??"}
{"text":"A great spot overlooking Mill Avenue where the beer is fresh and bold.  The garlic fries are not to be missed - like having fries and garlic bread at the same time!  They were the bomb-diggity.  The fish tacos were beautiful and delicious.  The Margherita flatbread was good but had a bit too much cheese.  Service was excellent.  A great hangout for a variety of occasions!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food came to the table warm not hot. If you want a Mico brew go to B.J."}
{"text":"Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well."}
{"text":"Great place with great beers. We were a little disappointed because they totally ignored one of the people in our party. It might not be their fault because he's quite small but we thought they'd at least offer him a kids menu. Overall great place, just keep in mind if someone in your party is under 6inches, this might not be the best place for your group."}
{"text":"In for Lunch. Asian Chicken bites to start followed by Seafood Cobb. Excellent! Enjoying the patio as well."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at GBs in Tempe. Two of us had burgers and two had salads. I was told that the salads were good. My mushroom and swiss burger was good sized  but that's the only thing positive I can say. It was BLAND, no flavor. I had to drown it in pepper and A1 just to choke it down. The garlic fries weren't much better. Just stick to beer."}
{"text":"We had a Happy Hour gathering of 20 friends for my daughter's birthday and it was perfect! We called a week ahead and the manager was most helpful. We pre-ordered appetizers--the awesome garlic fries, chicken fritters, charcuterie board, and cheese flatbread--and it was served in a timely fashion. The service from Justin and Charlene was excellent and efficient! This was the perfect gathering spot for a small celebration. I've been here before and never disappointed. Highly recommend for two or 20!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, the beer is better.  This is a good place for larger groups, a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday brunch. We came early to hear a jazz band - requested for a table near the band but was given one way on the other side. Service was slow. I ordered an omelette which came lukewarm. The English muffins we all had were very cold and hard. Replacement requested and was given the same. Took a while for iced tea and coffee refills. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Although this is one of a chain of similar restaurant/breweries, it's none the worse for that. The beer is fine if a little bland, and the food is great. We also visited on a Sunday afternoon which was jazz time, and felt a little like fresh meat for the older ladies there"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love coming here, but the past few times we've been in the last year have been huge let downs with both the food and service. We ate there for dinner last night with his family and it will probably be our last.   Our server was not very good - extremely slow, not very observant, forgetful, most orders came out incorrect which were addressed with free dessert, ect. It wasn't even very busy for that many mistakes to occur.   However, my real problem was with the guy running most of our food. It was apparent he did not want to be helping anyone, everything he brought to our table was delivered pretty aggressively, and when I got up to go to the restroom he very loudly yelled \"behind!\" and ran right past me. I was a server for a long time, and I would never yell \"behind\" to a guest. You let them go first with a smile...especially if they didn't see you coming. Words like \"behind\" should be saved for when you're in the kitchen or between servers on the floor."}
{"text":"They have the best Garlic Fries, but I was actually impressed with their Cajun Style Pasta, I did not expect it to be so delicious! Nice beer selection and even on a Busy Fri night, not a long wait for a seat. Definitely a Great Happy Hour spot."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, but didn't try a burger until the second time around...  One of the best I have had, not too sure what the name of it was but it had a fried egg on it, with the bacon jam!  AMAZING!  Their Hefeweizen isnt too bad either!"}
{"text":"Love their beer, garlic fries and the service!  never disappointed with my meals at Gordon Biersch...we were there last night and caught the tail end of their happy hour and it was perfect!  Try the tappas plate...their hummus is amazing.  Our servers were great especially for the bar area being packed.  Got out of there with a few drinks each between the 2 of us and 3 items off the hh menu for $36 including tip!  woo hoo... love it!"}
{"text":"Never before have I ever encountered a restaurant themed after mediocrity until dining here tonight at the Gordon Biersch restaurant. Our server, let's call him Manny, was so lifeless and chillingly disillusioned, I feared for his general well-being. The way he shuffled about on this Saturday night left much to be desired from his service skills. But enough about Manny. To the food.  The food was blandness itself. The only way to reassure myself that I was even eating food was through the mechanical motions of my mouth churning up and down and the swallow reflex. Otherwise, I'm not sure I had any experience with what could be called a meal at all. The sandwich I had was dry, like the Arizona desert surrounding this quaint little community. Its only redeeming quality was the avocado and ranch in my sandwich. However, when the taste of a sandwich stems not from the meat but from the sauces, it is a failure in my book. Condiments should be complimentary, not all-encompassing.   Praise must be given to the garlic fries, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole clove of garlic had found its way into my pile of garlic fries, which I promptly scarfed down. That clove of garlic was easily the best bite of the night.  Yes, I would return to this restaurant. It was not at all a negative experience. Just a shame that the server was a zombie and the food I had ordered was a little bland. I'm sure a couple of beers with some comrades would certainly enliven the experience for a 2nd visit. As for first impressions, the restaurant has made its mark on me, and thus, I mark it back with merely 2 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Biersch because of the exceptional service, beer selection, fantastic food, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour for our food to arrive. Our children were getting hungry and tired as well. We didn't get our food until after 9:30pm. The babies were getting fussy and started crying. The restaurant manager approached us telling us that there were complaints about our crying children and asked us to step out. So our husbands did step out with the babies. Our did not come until after 20 more minutes after that. Bad service at that Gordon Biersch. Truly truly disappointing. We know for sure we won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, however the service was horrible. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to bring tomato juice for one of our partymembers as well as charging another one of our partymembers 60 dollars for french fries on their debit card."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is fantastic! I love coming here, the food is always great and the service is spectacular. I have eaten in both the dining area and the bar area and we are always greeted promptly and well taken care of even when it is insanely busy in there. The patio is great and you can't beat it during spring/summer nights. It can get busy in the bar area during happy hour and it is self seating in the bar so be prepared to cheat, lie, steal, or shank someone for a table or booth when one opens up. The happy hours are great too, tons of great apps and drinks for decent prices. I paid $6.75 for a happy hour Blue Moon at Roadrunner Saloon and the beers at GB are stronger, better, and $4 during happy hour. Piss of Roadrunner. I hate you.   If you are in the mood for a nice dining experience they have a nice dining area, the service there is also impeccable. I have never had an issue with the service and the waiters are fun, witty, and good at their jobs.   Okay, I have to get on my soapbox for a minute, I am a waiter in a nice family restaurant so as for these people complaining about the place closing. Gordon Biersch is not a 24 hour bar. It is more so a nicer RESTAURANT. You can't walk into a restaurant at 10pm on a weekday and bitch when you are told that they are closing soon or that it is happy hour food only. There is a last call at a restaurant. If you want to sit at a bar and drink all night go to Three Angry Wives down the road. I am pretty sure the hours at GB during the week are till about 11pm and 1am on weekends. I've been there one time when it was quite late and there were only a few other people in the restaurant we were told they were closing soon and only serving happy hour food. So instead of being a bitch about it and thinking that because it is Vegas that every place should bend to me and stay open 24 hours I went to an actual bar that was open and got some food and suds. Stop whining people, not everyone is here to serve you at 11pm. Would you walk into a BJ's and expect them to stay open past their closing time for you and your two friends only? Besides everyone knows that 30 minutes prior to closing your getting the shit food that has been sitting out waiting for last minute customers to stroll in. Common sense, please."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was great - great food, great service, great selection of beer. We decided to make this our late night date night spot since we both don't get off work until 8pm, and by the time we arrive it's pushing 10:15. They don't close until 1am on weekends...Super convenient for those who work later shifts.   We came here the other night for dinner and probably will not be returning due to the lack of service.   They had 3 servers and a bartender on shift. We sat in the bar, kind of towards the back right next to the computer where they ring up your food/drinks. Literally, right next to it. We waited 10 minutes in the bar to get greeted. Every single waiter/waitress walked by, rang up their food and then walked away. Nobody ever came over. Got frustrated and asked a waitress (I forget her name) if we could get menus, and waters. After ROLLING HER EYES she grabbed us menus, brought us water and then walked away... we understood, it's late & she's probably had some crappy customers, so we were patient.   15 minutes after, she walks by and asks us if we're ready to order our food....we told her what we would like (French Dip) and she replies, \"The kitchen is out of that you'll have to pick someone else.\" Ok, no problem. I asked her if there is anything else that they're out of tonight, and she responded yes, and names off about 3 other dinner items. Ok...I get it, food runs out and there's not much you can do but why wouldn't you say that before asking what we wanted? The eye rolling, walking right past us when both drinks were empty, awful attitude continued. Ridiculous.  Food comes, and it's cold. Waited for 10 minutes before she came back around and acknowledged that we weren't eating.   Food comes back out 10 minutes later, hot and ready to eat. Finally.   I don't know what was wrong with her, but it all starts with your attitude. I definitely wasn't as chipper leaving as I was walking in. I suggest they find better staff members."}
{"text":"I visit Gordon Biersch more than any other restaurant near the strip.  This place is a favorite as I can do anything from a quick informal business lunch to a night out with the family here all while accumulating points on my Stein Club membership and enjoying some good beer.  (The Stein Club is the best bargain in town, it was $20 for the base Passport membership and $20 on top of that.- for that I have a locker and name plate holding my Stein for my next visit.  This is a nice ice breaker when bringing guests in, and they all want one as well.  Gordon also has quarterly events for members that includes free food and beer with some additional events thrown in just for fun.  The rewards program has paid for itself and more!) As far as the menu, the lobster tacos and the Jambalaya are always good. For desert, try the bread pudding, even for those who don't usually like bread pudding this one has made fans."}
{"text":"Chain resturant....not bad, dependable food.  Love the beer and some of the signature cocktails are decadent. Can get a little loud but the ambience has a good vibve.  Service was on par - anything is better than service in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with this restaurant. I came in for what I hoped to be a quick and delicious lunch, and almost two hours later I left very disappointed. The service took way to long and every placed order came to the table incorrect and had to be sent back. I really wanted to like this place but they gave me way too many reasons not to."}
{"text":"What a crappy experience I have been here many times and today was a different story.... It was sad that at 5pm with no one in the place they managed to make it a bad experience. First of all they could not keep my water full first down fall of bad service. Then they did not have the sides that went with my meal.... To end it all off it took forever to get my microwaved overpriced dessert what a disappointment. The manager was on the line making my dessert while the chef walked around in the open restaurant something wrong with all this who knows... Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We dined here this evening and I had such high hopes for this place, mostly because I've been to the location at Boca Park and the service and food is always great.  Being restaurant managers and coming from food service backgrounds ourselves my boyfriend and I tend to take it easy on our fellow comrades, but this was a little crazy. The only reason we are giving one star is because we could tell most of the issues might have been resolved if the poor waitress didn't have so many tables in her section.  To begin our party was a surprise dinner planned by myself and a friend for her husband. Everyone was to arrive by 6:45 and the birthday boy was to arrive promptly at 7pm. At 6:53pm the hostess came over to our table where 95% of us had already arrived and had our drink order taken and told us that there was a miscommunication and that that table was for another party arriving shortly. According to her our table was ready outside. I asked her if we could make the switch RIGHT AWAY that we would go. She assures me it is, walks out to the patio (maybe unaware I was following her) and proceeds to look bewildered at the scattered empty tables and heaters. Long story short, the guys in our party rushed to put this table together, our table had 2 heaters for 15 of us, we did not receive menus/share plates/silverware for quite sometime, and our server took even longer to take our food order.   IMPORTANT NOTE: I was not going to write a YELP about this experienced as I noticed all the tables the server had inside (and, again, I tend to take it easy on industry in situations like this), but the kicker came when I politely pulled the manager aside to give him a friendly heads up about the situation and he took zero blame and made no apologies. According to him it was entirely the servers responsibility to ask for help and as far as he was concerned all the tables he saw of hers were doing good (although he mentioned the only table he didn't know about, conveniently, was ours). Interesting to know given that I walked to the restroom and host stand several times for separate reasons, keeping my eyes peeled for a manager that was never there. In my professional opinion it is NEVER OK to make excuses to your guest and blame your staff. Was this guy serious? My intention was to give him a friendly heads up as a fellow restaurant manager and instead I left feeling more disappointed and a little bit disgusted.  My hope is that this particular manager reads this YELP and realizes the effect of his words and demeanor. Customer service rule #1 : The guest is always right. (even when they're not) and in this case we definitely were. Not sure I care to give this place another try in the near future. Hope this helps GM (I'm assuming this manager was not the GM)."}
{"text":"Garlic garlic garlic fries! Good Mother freaken burgers word to your mom!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch today we had the pretzel and sausage and tuna nachos both were wonderful The the real star was our waitress i cant say enough about  how attentive and kind"}
{"text":".The wine and server were excellent  The food was terrible. Ordered Bruchetta chicken. The cook \"forgot\" the tomatoes. The vegetables were barely eatable. The chicken was paper thin,  thoroughly dried and very bland. The fresh basil was anything but fresh."}
{"text":"This place is business lunch central. It is always crowded in here during lunch time. Every week they have great specials and the prices are not too bad. I tried a lot of things on their menu and the only thing I did not like was the ribeye steak it was like eating steak that was purchased from food 4 less. I was not too impressed. Garlic fries! What else is there to say. Decent prices, good menu and service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Meals with drinks can get pricey. Service is friendly and pretty quick. Pastas are surprisingly good."}
{"text":"This place was great, except for the food.  The food was good, but it wasn't as good as I expected to be.  Maybe it was just what I got, the linguini.  Anyway, I thought the place was overall pretty good.  The service was definitely good and the atmosphere was good too.  We were at the second floor and had a good view of the Tempe, AZ strip with all the bars and clubs along the way.  Overall it was good. I'd go back, but wouldn't get the linguini. Oh yeah, this place has its own brewery too.  I tried their beer and didn't like it.  Id take a Heiniken or a Miller lite any day over what they had.  I rather order a milk than the Gordon Biersch beer they had,  and Im lactose intolerant.  Their beer tasted like rotten Guiness."}
{"text":"Today my husband & I decided to return to Gordon Biersch (in Gilbert) and try it again. The hostess was very friendly and our server was great - but the food was really bad. My husband had the Tempura Shrimp and chicken. The chicken was dry, and the shrimp was small but tasted OK. I had Fish and chips - and was completely shocked that they even served it to me. The fish was burnt, and the fries looked and tasted like they had sat for awhile in grease. Both fish and fries were tasteless, lacked no favor. When I told our server that the fish was overcooked (was trying to be nice). Said sorry and walked away quickly. Will not be returning or recommending the place to numerous family and friends that come to visit."}
{"text":"Good happy hour food and drink options.  The food was well prepared and tasty.  The waiter was overloaded so the service was lacking.  Also, he wasn't up on the menu so I had to send back an order that included ingredients he didn't tell me about."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, and the service was great!  But our food was so-so.  Our waiter kindly treated me to a birthday dessert, but took away our food before we were finished in order to present it, forgetting to ask if we were finished.....guess that's one way to make me save room to eat it!   The atmosphere was great, and the beer selection was amazing. The burger was good, the pizza was average."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself at this place; the beer was great, the food, not so great, but what a selection! I had the Steak Frites, and it just wasnt a great cut--very chewy. But no worries. It was my first time there, and as I looked around, I thought about what a great first date place this could be, or even a nice place to catch a game sometime. When I had eaten all I could, there was still alot left over. My food sat and sat there until Ifinally asked for a to go container. That's what I got--a container. I had to load it myself. ok...again...no worries. Granted, I was now drunk, but in my 40 odd years on Earth, I have never once forgotten to pay a check. I paid my check (cash), got change, and left a generous tip WITH THAT CHANGE. By the time I get to the parking lot, I'm chased down by one of the bar men, saying sir, u have to pay your bill. I assumed they had me confused with someone else. I asked how much \"I owed\". and he said the amount of my bill which I indeed remembered was the amount I had paid. I went back inside, to show my face to the barmaid who had been taking care of me, and asked if she got the tip. She said she had, but not the bill. How does one get the tip I paid with the change I got from breaking the $100...without remembering breaking the $100?! They \"graciously\" checked her drawer to see if there was an overage, there \"was not\". I don't think that if she took the money, she wouldve put it in her drawer! Rather than concern the police, I paid again (no tip the 2nd time! lol) The warning here is, altho it's a decent place, just pay strict attention when you pay, to whom you pay, and get a receipt! Better yet, pay with credit cards. Otherwise, a decent night can become an embarrassing nightmare."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in a long time. Kobe beef burgers, very delicious pizza and detailed salads leave you feeling satisfied. I don't recommend the garlic fries unless you really enjoy garlic. However everything was delicious and the atmosphere was completely wonderful. Worth the high price, and the staff was amazing. This place is at the top of my list of recommendations. If you're looking for a place for drinks this is the place to go, haven't been to a brewery restaurant like this before and it's amazing. Defiantly a long list of alcohol, and extensive menu."}
{"text":"Food here is good.  They have some good Happy Hour dishes.  Their Märzen, Winter Bock and Maibock are awesome!"}
{"text":"After not having Gordon Biersch for years (mainly in Aneheim and Pasadena), I decided to head over to the one in Vegas at Boca Park.  This one seemed a little more low-key than the others, but the food was fantastic.  The garlic fries are always a must have and they made them perfectly well here. I decided to order the Cajun Pasta, which had shrimp, sausage, and chicken and it was one of the best pastas I've ever had. Service was pretty good and overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer (do the comparative beer tasting) and jazzy live music to top it off.  Plus out door seating on the north side!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  They have the best fish tacos in town.  The beer here is great too, if you like the german style beers.  The food is consistently great at lunch and dinner.  My complaint is that the service here is sub-par.  I have eaten/drank at the bar, the out-door area, and inside the restaurant.  The service is so incredibly slow.  You can literally sit and wait with an empty drink for 20 minutes before someone comes by to see if you need/want another drink, and then it might be another 10-20 minutes before they bring it to you.  It might just be me, but this really irritates me.  Especially when you can see the wait staff chatting with each other near the bar for 5-10 minutes while you are waiting.    We decided to go to Grimaldi's instead.  It is the same parking lot, and they have the best Pizza I have ever eaten.  Their wait staff almost always approaches you before your drink is empty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The garlic fries are awesome. Always good service and happy waiters. Never have to wait very long unless there is a football or hockey game that night. Bacon cheese burger extra rare is a huge burger and fries For only 10.50."}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover than this place for you. The Schwartz Bier is superb. We sat at the bar and service was great. Only ordered appetizers but they were a little on the pricey side, otherwise 5 stars. The cheese curds were the best. Even got a growler to go!"}
{"text":"This place is like no other. Ive never been to a restaurant that has a brewery as well. There are multiple levels of things to see, there's the brewery itself, where you eat, and merchandise. We ate outside on the balcony which has a great view. Inside had huge televisions to enjoy watching whatever you wanted while you ate. The location of the place was great as well, its right in Tempe and has lots to do and see around it. The Food and drinks here were great as well!  My family and I tried multiple meals and drinks and loved them all. I will definitely revisit this place when i go back out to AZ!"}
{"text":"We had 12 of us.  I called a few hours before and made a reservation, just so they knew to expect us.  I said we'd be there at 7:15.  The group arrived between 7 and 7:20.  I'd say by 7:30 we were done greeting each other and we sat down with our menus.  After 10 minutes, I went to the hostess and said I think our party of 12 has been forgotten.  She said something that didn't make sense and walked off.  I figured she was getting someone.  10 minutes later she shows up with silverware.  We already have that, we have menus.  We just don't have a server, no water, no greeting.    By now, I'm calling other restaurants around to see if they can take us, because I don't want to go through with a meal that starts this bad.  But the group decides to stay.  Another 5 minutes and a server shows up.  I'm pissed, and I let her know.  She says it's not her fault, they just asked her to come over.  No apology, I told her I'm not blaming her, but when your in the service business and the team messes up, you need to apologize for the team.  From that point on she did very well, and she really hustled.  Though her section was far from us, so I think our food sat for a while before being brought out.  Our food showed up at 9.  Now the help is there, with 5 people bringing our food.    That first half hour, the manager was working near us and had to have seen us.  I should have grabbed him earlier, and I should have insisted on getting something comped, but having to do that ruins my meal even further, especially with a group this size.  Besides getting a few bucks off doesn't do anything for me anyway, especially when I have to ask for it.  So, nothing was comped, no apology, just 2 hours in this place to eat a meal.  (Actually we left at 10, but this family is the slowest at saying goodbyes of any family I've seen, so we'll credit the restaurant with 2 of the 2.5 hours.)  The food:  Chicken schnitzel was overcooked, dry, no sauce to speak of.  Sausage platter (or whatever they call it) was 3 unremarkable brats, it was ok, but nothing special.  One person had Chipotle chicken lettuce tacos (you know, lettuce instead of tortilla) that they really liked.  My daughter liked the lobster mac and cheese.  My other daughter liked the CBLT or something like that.  I didn't hear any other complaints about food.  Bottom line, it was clearly understaffed, and the staff appears conditioned to accept those conditions and not be too concerned if customers expect a bit more.  Too many other choices out there to risk it here."}
{"text":"Shortly after we left the Cheesecake Factory (right next door), we came over to the Gordon Biersch for HH. I had the Carribean Margarita (which has Malibu rum) and some other drinks mixed into one. I can not even remember what was in the recipe but it was good. They added a little too much salt though. One of the girls had a lemon drop martini, one had another martini, and the last gal had a mojito... The waitress had told us that for HH, it was $5 for each of our drinks, $2 off for the wines, and $1 off of the beers. Thanks ladies for a wonderful night! To top the night off, we sat outdoors.. It was nice since the weather was just right and the scenery was nice as well.. Like the water fountain that wasn't too far had lighting in it that glowed."}
{"text":"Great time. 14 for dinner. They took very good care of us. Hostess's were awesome. Server, Anna was great. Beer was spot on. I will go back. Really good energy."}
{"text":"0 stars for these guys...  Im sorry, but the service was horrible and the food had no taste and was overcooked.   Started with the waitress coming to our table and saying,\"my name is ____, have you figured out what you want?  No?  Ok, I'll come back then when you're not trying to decide\" walking away not giving us a chance to ask what was good/bad and generally not caring about serving us.   Waited several minutes for drink refills (more than 5) after the waitress passed our table several times with a water pitcher to fill up neighboring tables with our water.  Did we say something wrong or did we look at the waitress wrong??  Who knows...  Everyone raves about the garlic fries but mine were soggy and had several cloves worth piled on top.  Very disappointing that the a majority of the appetizers are as much as the entrees not to mention steaks well above $20.  I don't want to go back but the manager was gracious enough to comp our entire check (almost like its so common that it doesn't phase them).  For that I will give GB another try, but I'm not expecting anything.  1 star for the view, however sitting by the windows this time of year is freezing even while wearing jackets!  It was like sitting outside.  I was glad to get outta there and to the heat in my car..."}
{"text":"Went to Gordon biersch brewery for my birthday called ahead made reservations for Jason's section I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and we had the most incredible service Jason was awesome!!!

Totally enjoyed I ended up ordering another side of veggie which was fresh green beans and purple onion Jason again was fabulous!! I got the bill and I tipped him very well and he thanked me very much he looked at me like I was crazy!!! The thing is my boyfriend and I love to cook we don't like going out very often and now you will hear why. So as I mentioned I called asked for Jason's section you got 3 Jasons? Surprise me I wanted the service I had before NOPE!!! None of the Jason's were working instead we got dori she's cute a nice personality but her service I'm sorry to say sucked! We waited (the 6 of us) for drinks soda tea wine and non alcoholic beer my parents asked for lemon 3 times being a server myself you need to be on the simplest things I ended up going to the bar to get lemon my steak was ok the gorgzola butter was melted my mash tatters cold and now they had broccoli which I love but needed to be cooked a bit longer and woulda been nice if they were warm so that tells me my food was under the warmer lamp for awhile the others not impressed either she came by once to ask how things were of course we said fine when ready to go I had to ask another server to get ours so we could get some boxes what a difference in customer service! Now the person taking the reservation shoulda told me none of the Jason's working I woulda gone in when he was needless to say once again embarrassing to suggest this place we went early in the day 4:00 place wasn't busy at all and needless to say her tip sucked!!! I wasn't embarrassed about that! I hope she thinks \"oh gee what did I do wrong\" instead she'll probably say \"those assholes\" but you know what dori and all the other servers out there??? TIPS MEAN To Insure Proper Service"}
{"text":"Well that was a disappointment. We used to dine here often when they first opened. Then we ventured off to other options. (Dave's) The service was always great. Well it has changed. We are Passport members and received a coupon for a Cheeseburger & beer for $10 on Tax Tuesday only. The husband called ahead and asked if we could use the coupons for our non-drinking members but still have the beers for us. He was assured they were flexible with coupon. The fine print said: one coupon per person. So after a 20 minute wait to sit, our waitress arrives and tells us no that won't work with the coupons. We order drinks and try not be annoyed. We decide on three cheeseburgers and pizza. Then the waitress returns (without the drinks) and says the manager said the coupon deal will work. Oh well we've decided differently. So we order and wait for our beers.....................................................................and wait..............................................................oh here they are. Warm. No apology just 'here you go'. Then we wait..................................................................................................and get our dinner. The WAITRESS realizes we have no utensils or napkins. So we wait.............................................but I see some on a clean table inside, I walk in and take them off the table. As I'm walking out I run into her she says \"oh, sorry\". So I finally dig in and it's so blah, we ordering the beef medium and it was overcooked very charred on the outside with a slice of cheddar, a bit of shredded lettuce, slice of tomato, on a big bun. I had garlic fries as they used to be so good. These were cold, greasy and mushy. The waitress never came by to ask how the meal was. But she finally showed up and stated \"you are welcome to one more beer would you like it\"? Yes, and then we ............you guessed it! WAIT..........................................................................................................................................................................................Sigh. She finally brought it and it was a least cold this time. Then we were done and yes, we waited and waited and waited for the check. Until we got up and could have left but we went inside and ....waited. The I think the manager went and found it for us. So dear waitress, we are good tippers even for unspecial service but never, never for complete disregard for any customer service.  I can't see us going back any time in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and keep coming back. Great microbrews and decent menu. Check it out for consistent americana"}
{"text":"Great views of mill Ave and good microbrews. Wouldn't suggest going for the food though."}
{"text":"I'm normally try to be pretty patient and understanding at restaurants, but there's no reason my sandwich took well over an hour.  They're not busy, in fact, almost empty, yet I was told the kitchen was too backed up.  The manager dropped off the food and made no mention of it taking over an hour. I don't expect anything other than just a \"sorry\" in passing, but not even a word.  The food alone is maybe a 3 star. Definitely a disappointing meal. Don't fall for the \"legendary garlic fries\" as they're literally just fries with a ridiculous amount of garlic on top of them.  I have to give the server credit for recognizing their screw up. She comped the meal and wouldn't let me pay despite telling her it was not necessary.  Usually I'll give places a second chance, but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"When I visit the Phoenix area, I usually try to stop at this restaurant once during the trip.  It is situated in a great shopping complex, so my wife can shop and we can grab a great dinner on their outside deck.  The beer is always very good and the service is friendly, I was also amazed that they have great crab cakes on their menu.  Hard to believe that you could get a great seafood dinner out in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. We had the garlic fries which were awesome, but also ordered the chicken schnitzel and spaetzle. I'm German, and this wasn't chicken schnitzel nor spaetzle. The sauce was so lemony you couldn't taste anything except lemon, not even the chicken itself. The spaetzle didn't resemble or taste like spaetzle. For the price we paid for the dishes I was expecting better. Perhaps other dishes are nicer, but we probably won't return to find out."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and uncaring server. Yes it was a football game night, did they not know what to expect?  It took 10 minutes for our server to bother to notice us and another 45 to get food. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocrity, thy name is Gordon.   Came here on friend's recommendation to enjoy the outdoor patio and presumably from the name, large amount of fine beers. The patio was OK, but that was about the highlight. I found the beer menu surprisingly limited and uninspired. My friend and I were both disappointed with our ($28!) steaks. Our waiter was moody and uninformed. When we asked for beer and food recommendations his reply was: \"Well, I like it all.\" Thanks, buddy."}

{"text":"I always get the chicken caesar salad and a good plate of garlic fries.  It is fantastic.  The garlic fries is really amazing!  Ample parking with a good view of the Residence Inn by Marriott.  That hotel is magnificent at night.  GB also has two (or more) event spaces available for booking group gatherings."}
{"text":"So, last Friday my honey and I attended a ballet at The Smith Center.  By the time we picked up the car from the valet it was past 9:30PM and we were STARVING!  All dressed up in our theater finery, we didn't much feel like fast food and the thought came to mind that we had never tried Gordon Biersch on Paradise and it always looked inviting from the outside so we thought, why not?  So glad we took a chance.  We got there about quarter to ten and were quickly seated.  Admittedly, they were not busy at that hour but still, it was nice being attended to so politely and with such courtesy.  Our server came over moments after we were seated and introduced himself to us.  Being that it was our first time there, he went over the menu with us and based on our feedback, made some recommendations for beverage and food.  I ordered one of their craft beers and my sweetie had a glass of wine.  Both were very nice.  For dinner, I ordered the Jambalaya and wifey the Chicken Pasta.  OMG!  Both were so good!  Her Chicken Pasta was full of flavor and my Jambalaya had just the right amount of \"bad\" in it to be wonderful.  Oh, and the desserts?  You know how so many places bring you way too much after a full meal?  Well here, they offer Mini Dessert Tasters, giving you just a few bites to finish off your meal, leaving a sweet taste in your mouth.    Satisfied does not even begin to express how great an experience this was for us.  We will definately put this on our list of prefered places to dine.  I have over 100 girls coming to town early next year and may very well arrange to have this as one of our dining options during the week they are here!  Well done, Mr. Biersch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met a couple of our friends here for a business lunch.   Our waitress was super friendly and seem very knowledgable. She was extremely patient even though it took us at least 20 minutes to order.    We started off with beers. Hefewiezen is delicious. (A German-style wheat beer that is crisp and refreshing. This light and sparkling beer is known for its signature aroma that suggests cloves and bananas).   However, if you cannot choose your favorite flavor, I would suggest The Sampler. It gives you a sample of all five beers in the shooter glasses.   As for the actual food (remember we were here for a lunch), we wanted to step outside of our 'comfort zone' so we decided to order something that we usually would not.   I had Lobster and Shrimp Mac 'N Cheese (Our twist on the classic mac 'n cheese. Sautéed lobster and shrimp tossed in a creamy parmesan-havarti cheese sauce with bowtie pasta - $19.95).   All I can say is... WOW!! This dish should not even have words mac 'n cheese in it because they don't do it any justice.  The flavors definately blew my mind! For all those who (heart) cheese, pasta and seafood, this dish should be a must!!  My husband ordered Blackened Mahi Mahi Sandwich (with Cajun remoulade, baby greens, tomatoes and Garlic Fries - $11.95).  Neither of us eat Mahi Mahi often but I must say that if I ever had a craving for some Mahi Mahi Sandwich, this would be a place to go to. Once again, the flavors blended perfectly. The only negative comment I would have about this dish is that it was a tad bit peppery for my taste buds.  All in all GB is great place to go to. We definately will be back, with or without our friends! ;)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation last night before a concert.  Took us 10 minutes waiting in line to get to the receptionist.  We were seated and drink order taken. We were told if we got alcohol it would take quite a while as the bar was backed up.  Brought my ice tea in a paper cup because there were no clean glasses.  They took our order and 1 hour later we were told the food was just now getting prepared. Several tables around us had the same experience and we all left to get to the concert on time.  The waitress was not apologetic, did not keep us updated on our food order and did not seem to care.  The manager came out to tables around us, ignored us and was not helpful either.  They were not prepared for a crowd although they are located in Westgate where there are events all the time.  I will never return to the restaurant again.  Very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour before a game at Jobing.com.  Nice selection of beers and appetizers, all reasonably priced.  Attentive service.  I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"It was super crowded but we went on a Friday night. Garlic fries were amazing! We were there for a party, so we had samplings of a lot of the finger foods. I was pleased with everything I ate. Servers were a little overwhelmed but again, it was a Friday and I wasn't starving so it was perfectly fine. I had the Strawberry Soda (very similar to a Mojito) and it was SUPER. I had more than one...I tried about 4 other drinks on their mixed drink menu, but none of the others can I remember. I would definitely go back next year!"}
{"text":"Dankashane Darling Dankashane!   Great location and good food, Gordon Biersch is a decent spot to grab a micro brew and an appetizer with friends. The GB (Gordon Biersch) beers they have on tap have never disappointed me, but never really blown me away either. They have many other cocktails, but when you order a sweet cocktail at a place like this, expect little liquor and lots of sugar. For some that is just fine, but when I order a cocktail, I want to taste the spirits with every sip.   The decor is nice here. There are many vintage prints on the wall with names like Campari, Bugatti, and some German products being featured. The bar has a few TVs, but this is not a sports bar. There are copper colored accents around the restaurant which ornament the wood trim.   The food - Good stuff in general. The appetizer platter is a nice way to start the meal if you're with a group. I especially love the Asian wings, which have a sticky glaze, crisp breading, and sweet-chili flavor. The garlic fries are GAAAAARRRLIICTASTIC! They are delicious, but stay away from them if you plan on doing some kissing or close talking after dinner. Really nobody should be close talking anyways, its gross and people don't like it.    I like this spot for a casual and relaxed bite, especially when I'm not trying to eat healthy. Yes you can eat healthy here but honestly, that isn't why you came, so just go for it. The gym will be waiting for you when you get up from your nap."}
{"text":"We were greated by friendly staff and escorted to the dining area. Two groups came in after us and the waiter went to the third group first. We counted over 6  of wait staff doing nothing. We got up and walked out with no one ever coming to our table."}
{"text":"I went to Gordon Biersch with my family to get some burgers. My brother and I, who are very allergic to food dyes, ordered the same burger, but requested cheddar cheese instead of American, which has food dye. When our burgers arrived, they had American cheese. When we asked about this, the chef told us it was cheddar after we stated that we were allergic to American. It clearly wasn't, and sent it back to be remade after even the waiter agreed that it was clearly American cheese. When the new burger arrived, I noticed a small amount of cheese on the side of my burger, and decided to check under the new cheddar slice out of curiosity. It turns out, the chef just scraped the cheese off the top of both burgers, leaving a considerable amount of the cheese still on, and covered it with cheddar. Although the waiters and management were respectful during this ordeal, the fact that the chef could be so negligent when allergies are involved shocks me. If anyone special orders any meal at this location, I highly suggest double checking the food yourself."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Summerlin GB.  I have been to the Paradise location many times and never felt compelled to review it.  However, I had a very delicious Mahi-Mahi with pineapple, strawberry, mango salsa along with my favorite of the home brews-Marzen.  It just all came together as a great meal worthy of mention.   I know they are noted for their garlic fries.  Honestly, I'm not a fan.  You get within 50 feet of the Paradise location and your sense of smell is bombarded with garlic.  That was not the case in Summerlin and I found my dinner and beer just tasted better."}
{"text":"Very good food and decent micro beers. The restaurant wasn't busy at all due to the time of the day and of course the service was excellent. Had the Kobe sliders and an order of the garlic fries. Definitely worth a stop to check out."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went on a Tuesday night to celebrate our friend's birthday. It was a disaster from the beginning. The waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink. She also failed to notice that one of our guests had accidentally spilled his soda and commented to the spiller \"wow! you're really sucking those down let me grab you another one\" and left him in a wet mess. Out of all 7 of us, only the birthday girl's entree was messed out [talk about some bad birthday luck!]. The salmon she ordered wasn't fully cooked! And she's not a fan of sushi... The waitress didn't apologize and just said \"oh, i'll take it to the kitchen so they can fix it.\" Our birthday girl had a chat with the manager to let him know that we were a little \"miffed\" by the [lack of] service to say the least. The manager said he would send us a new waitress and comp her uncooked salmon. We never got a new waitress and when she brought us the bill she proclaimed \"wow! for some reason my manager gave ya'll a 25% discount! you guys must be stoked!\" ...On the way out, one of our guests overheard her telling a fellow waitress that \"I heard heroin isn't bad for you so I do it from time to time.\"   Just another example of why drugs are bad for you kids."}
{"text":"I went to the pumpkin patch with my daughter and her family. We stopped in for dinner. They sat us right away and had the two high chairs for my one year old grandsons (twins).  I had the California burger and it was delicious.  The fries I thought I would not like as they were garlic fries. To my surprise they were devilish delicious.  Our waiter Scott was very attentive and brought us two plastic water cups for the boys. That was very nice. He made the visit a memorable one.  On a sad note, October 31 will be their last day open."}
{"text":"First timer here. Food was good but for not being busy it took sometime for the waiter to address us. Also, if you have a roof leak, don't allow people to sit under it!!! Block it off!!!! Really sucks when your eating and water is dripping from the ceiling on to your back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to hang out with a group of friends. Nice, relaxed atmosphere. They have great happy hour with food and drink specials.  The food is pretty good- a little of everything, seafood, burgers, pastas, tacos, etc. Service is good here. It gets busy but we never have to wait long for seats or food.  The garlic fries are to die for!  Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a couple times at this restaurant.  The food is pretty good.  I'd give the food alone a 7 out of 10.  But the service leaves something to be desired.  The servers aren't awful, but they aren't great.  Just little things like not being quick to pick up dirty dishes, asking me to move things on the table (even though I hadn't done anything except take the napkin down off the table) so she can put a plate down, and like putting a beer down in front of me that was ordered by someone else at the table.  She quickly realized it wasn't mine, but had already spilled some in front of me (didn't even set it down on a coaster anyway) and then left the spilled beer sitting in front of me, didn't wipe it up.  So I had to use my lap napkin to clean it up.  All of these things happened on the last visit, and I should add it was a Tuesday evening around 8:00, so they weren't busy at all at the time.  I just would have liked a bit better service.  The previous times I've been here it's been much the same.  Not terrible, not great.  Food is good, beers are good, service is meh."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are regulars at GB and have never been disappointed.    HAPPY HOUR: Often we just order off of the HH menu.  Some of our favorites include the Blue Crab and Artichoke Dip, the Fried Calamari (with yummy wasabi dip!), Southwest Eggrolls, Baja Tacos and Tapas (although we don't get the Tapas anymore now that they stopped serving it with roasted garlic, which was delish).  And their HH goes until 6:30 pm (which gives us extra time to order seconds!).  BEER: We've never been disappointed in the craft beer at GB.  While some of them aren't to our tastes, the quality is always great.  The Marzen is my favorite on the regular menu, but I love the seasonals, especially the Festbier and the Winterbock.  SERVICE/STAFF: The staff (especially Kenny and Cicely) treat us great (and we return the favor).  They've always taken great care of us, happily handling our special requests.  We've experienced the occasional slow kitchen, but that's typically been when they've had big parties who all put their orders in at the same time.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  REGULAR FOOD: We've tried a bunch of different items on the regular menu, and have never been disappointed.  Some of our favorites are the Beer-Battered Fish and Chips, Cajun Pasta, Jambalaya, Burgers and CBLT (chicken BLT).  And the more you go, the more you get back when you join the Passport or Stein Clubs!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is consistent no matter where you go - DC, Gilbert, Honolulu, you know what you'll get when you walk through the door:  good food with good lagers. The food is reasonable, and the beers are good.  If you're looking for 5 star food, check the Michelin guide.  If you want  an excellent, fresh seasonal lager at a good price, go to GB and try their Festbeer.  You won't be led astray.  Pair that with the Moroccan Chicken, and you'll get your money's worth.  GB is good."}
{"text":"I have always gotten good food here!  I got the shrimp and Lobster tacos, they are awesome!!  They made the tacos gluten free for my daughter and she loved them too. My daughter usually gets a salad and she claims that they have the best salad she's ever eaten.  And the beers are good too!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say was this place is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!  We had a decent size dinner party of 20 people in celebration of SEMA Car Show week and I must say the service here was awesome especially trying to handle 20 people and keeping everyone happy and satisfied with their drinks. Since we had a big party we decided to have a certain selective choices in entrees so it makes it easier for everyone to order but the appetizers and salad everyone in the party had.  Here is the list of food we ate: Blue Crab and Artichoke Dip Our Legendary Garlic Fries - Regular Order Classic Pepperoni Pizza Veggie Pizza Caesar  For the entree with had something similar to the Steak frites with garlic fries on the side and changed it up and had gorgonzola butter on the side. This was extra tasty!!!!!  All of our food came out exactly how we ordered and we are definitely going to come back here next year for SEMA."}
{"text":"This place is amazing on Sunday.  They have live music playing all your favorite jams.  The dance floor stays packed and the food is delicious.  Games on every TV and music sounds amazing.  $3 Mimosas and $5 Bloody Mary's. A feel good atmosphere.  Come learn your favorite 2 step too!!!"}
{"text":"I will never go to this restaurant again, service is absolutely horrible,  we were going to a concert, made reservations so we were seated okay, then...took forever to get our drinks, then the other 2 people that were meeting us came and again took forever to get their order put in and then had to flag down someone else to get their drinks and take our order. Then easy orders took forever and one of my friends never received her slider so they took that off the ticket.$4.99.no reason to take so long for service and food to be delivered...horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"Had a comical trip here on Saturday.  First of all I'm going to assume the server was new because he made a series of pretty rookie mistakes.  If someone orders a vodka tonic you would typically garnish that with a lime or worst case scenario a lemon wedge?  Then if you forgot that and someone asked you for a lime you would quickly go get that, right?  Nope, not our rookie.  He disappeared for a bit and returned asking if he could take our entree order.  I suggested again that he bring out some limes for my wife's drink and this time he was successful.  The rest of the comedy that evening centered around him giving people the wrong things.  My sons were given each others drinks and when the entrees came he gave my son my steak and vice versa.  Then, despite us ordering garlic fries as our side instead of traditional ones he brought us regular fries.  When I pointed this out he said, \"Yeah I noticed that too but apparently it only comes with regular fries\".  Funny, that's not what the menu said, hence why we ordered the garlic fries.  In his defense he did offer to bring us a side of garlic fries so the recovery there was fine.  When the bill came I was pleasantly surprised to find that neither of my son's sodas were on the check but that's a 50/50 these days since servers don't need to ring them into the POS in order to get them.  Half the time they forget and the other half they're just hoping it will translate into a bigger tip.  Food was decent but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love Gordon Biersch.  Biersch Biersch, Biersch, down into my belly.  I enjoy their beer.  I enjoy their food, and I enjoy their atmosphere.  I have been going to this Biersch location for about 2.5 years and I love it.  Awesome happy hour prices and amazing staff that is always helpful and fun.  People who complain about the prices need to utilize the happy hour prices which are available daily.  Even not on happy hour, their beers are only $4.  I've had more expensive beers elsewhere."}
{"text":"It is a chain restaurant with decent beer and decent food.  What gives this place five stars is excellent service.  Keep up the good job putting the customer first!  The managers at this restaurant could show folks in other industries how to treat people."}
{"text":"chain, chain, chain, chain of fools... I always break out my Aretha when I find myself here. Cold beer, unhealthy appetizers, always has patrons. I just dont get why. It is close the the theater. Chain, chain, chain...."}
{"text":"Food was great, beer is good and the service was good until the end when we asked to have the check split (between two couples - not something one would think is difficult.) Our waitress was visibly upset and snatched the receipt and stormed off. She came back with the split check (for which we thanked her), she huff'd and walked away. Not something that would cause me to tell people not to go, but be aware that check splitting may be frowned upon!"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would allow tenths of a point. It's a 2.25. Female bartender was annoyed that she made so little money. Get another job honey! That was meant to be derogatory with the honey. I am a bartender for 25 years. I do not care how much I make and you know what, I always do well! People see that stuff! Too many superficial bartenders like her. No joy. The male bartender who took over at 4pm with the peaked hair was much better. He's solid.  Now, I was apprehensive about another chain restaurant and rightfully so. That why I have never gone, I was feeling adventurous. One quarter of the beer was terrible (I rated it on UnTappd as swill), the next quarter not good, and the other half was good to very good. I only drank their brews. The beer was a 2.25 at best. No water was offered. Beer is s a diuretic and Mesa is a desert. Irresponsible   The Chicken Schnitzel was a 2.25 as well. Over lemoned, too much grease, and charred. It's lemon and caper chicken, a delicate dish, and you killed it with lemon, grease and over-cooking it. If I could have cooked the same dish at home you get this rating. This is what I might do, but you are a professional chef. Sigh. The interior decoration was standard corporate restaurant, uninspiring.  I liked the male bartender, the music, and the price of $6.50 for a flight of 6 beers of 4oz each.  Another American corporation ruining good food & drink. Will not return. So many better places to spend my hard earned tips."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a very long time. Years in fact. I have not really enjoyed past experiences here. But, it was my friends Birthday and this is where she wanted to go. We came a little after 1:30 which turned out to be great!  Because, it was not very busy. Which was awesome. Our server was very good and very attentive. I do not like the water they serve, it is tap water, and if not it sure tastes like it. So I drank only my Hot Tea. We both had a fantastic meal. I had the Seafood Cobb salad with crab meat. My friend got the Salmon Caesar Salad, Both absolutely delish! Then because, it was her Birthday, she got to choose any Dessert from the Menu. I thought that was pretty nice. She chose the Bread Pudding. Oh my gosh!!! Wonderful,Wonderful! We had a great afternoon here.  Restrooms are nice and clean. There is an elevator if you do not want to walk 2 sets of stairs when you come in. Plus, when it cools down you can sit on the Balcony. You must pay to park,thank you Tempe. The days of free parking are long gone.  You can't stop Progress. All in all , great place,we loved our lunch and the service."}
{"text":"Happy hour on Friday.  My first visit to this location though I've been to others in the chain.  Sat at the bar: beer was excellent as always, the bartender was awesome and the food was good.  Not too many folks here in the late afternoon.  No complaints.  For this category of restaurant I'd say its the best value plus not many around here have Friday happy hour."}
{"text":"Decent beer but the burger looked and tasted like it was just thawed. The garlic fries are ok but very limp. I keep coming back against my wife's wishes but I think I'll listen to her next time."}
{"text":"We had a large event in a private room this past weekend and whereas the actual coordinator was not the best, the staff that helped, especially  Bird, far made up for it.  Bird was the staff leader for the event and it went off without a hitch, everybody that attended was well taken care of and I really appreciated the hospitality of those 3 individuals that helped all night.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I went to Gordon Biersch Brewery after Octoberfest 2013, and needless to say I was already buzzin and wanted to have some good food, because well Octoberfest failed to provide.  Anywho , as we strolled down Mill Ave my friend recommended Gordon Biersch Brewery, and I said \"what the heck why not\" It was going to be a new experience for me. Well as we walked up the 3 flights of stairs I was very impressed with such a nice place. It was clean, we sat outside on the 2nd floor overlooking Mill Ave and it was such a nice view.  We had 2 delicious \"Hefeweizen\" beers and they were absolutely wonderful, fresh, yummy with a hint of Banana as the aftertaste, It was liquid heaven indeed.   My friend and I both had the Marzen Burger with garlic fries and it was good.  The server was great, gave us a lot of attention and served us with a smile. All in all it was a fun experience.   We had purchased some candles at octoberfest and we had these tiny bags to hold our stuff in, and somehow accidentally left our bags on the table after we had paid for our food.  We simply walked out and left it behind.  Later that evening, just before Gordon Biersch Brewery had closed we realized that we didn't have our stuff with us. I immediately called them at 11pm and asked if we had left our bags there, and they quickly said yes, the Gentleman I spoke with was \"Mike\"   So the next day I took off work early, invited my buddy to tag along and have another round of Hefeweizen's in the afternoon and this time we took the elevator rather than walk up the flight of stairs, and the elevator takes right into the dining area, very classy.  So once again I took the patio, shared a few Hefenweizen's and was treated good. Thanks again Mike for holding onto my candles and not letting anyone rip me off.  Such a class act, I will definitely be back and bring along my Dad to give him a taste of a new beer and EXCELLENT SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant but in the past 4 years, it's gone a little downhill. I visited on a Sunday for happy hour.  When we got there, we were told happy hour was in the bar and there were 3 of us. So we start looking for a table since it is \"open seating\", the two tables that were empty and could fit 3 people had not been cleared off. I politely asked the server if he could clear off the table, he said \"just a minute\". My friends and I waited about 10 minutes and nothing. So I went to the other server and asked if she could clear off the table, she apologized and started clearing it off. Another 5 minutes of waiting, and we finally were seated. (Mind you, it's 3 pm on a Sunday, it's not busy at all.) so we sit down and she brings us waters. We don't see her for another 10 minutes and we don't have menus either. So I had to physically get up and walk to the hostess desk to get us menus. She finally comes over and asks us for our drinks after 30 minutes of being there, and waiting 15 after being seated. By this time, my friends and i are over it and go to the Thirsty Lion."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend. We have been to this location a few times & we thoroughly enjoyed our selves both times. The sliders on the small plates menu are delicious & their house made root beer is yummy!"}
{"text":"The service and food quality have really gone downhill in the last year or so.  My husband and I used to go there a couple days a month for lunch. I would often  the lobster bisque  and a wedge salad.  It used to be delicious.  When I went there last month, the bisque was the consistency of pudding with a skin on it.  The waitress was terrible, I sat there with this nasty soup for 20 minutes, she never came to check in us. (Mind you this was a day where there were about 3 other couples in the restaurant and that was it. ) When she did come back she asked if I was finished and started taking the soup away.  I told her that the soup was pretty cold and inedible.  She looked surprised.  Did she think I loved it, and that was why I didn't eat any of it? Anyhow, she asked of I wanted another bowl.  I said no, just take it off the check please.  No apologies for the shitty food.  She never once refilled out drinks which were empty for about 30 minutes.   I've gone back once since then, and the egg rolls were cold, the fries soggy, and the fish dry.  I'm not sure what's happening over there but they need to step it up ant fix the issues that are going on and make the place what it used to be."}
{"text":"3 words: Tuscan chicken pasta.  I could eat like 5 plates of this... Soooooo DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Went again for brunch a couple months ago & although the menu was the same the food wasn't. I have no desire to ever have it again. With that being said, thought we would go for happy hour to try something other than breakfast again. The menu has changed from the last time we were there & not for the better. Food choices are limited & besides the beer the rest of the prices were not that great. Did not eat and would not make a special trip for happy hour again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service at this restaurant location. The place was very empty at the time--around 8:30 on a Sunday night. We stood waiting for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes... At first, we thought that they were closed! We were seated in a very strange location of the restaurant pushed off to the corner at a table that was far too small for our party of three (odd, since the restaurant was so empty). The worst service however came from our waiter, who was extremely slow! We waited at least 15 minutes for our drink orders, over 45 for our food, and our drinks were never refilled ONCE! My friend had to eventually find our waiter and ask him for our check when we were done eating. The food was alright but I don't think I'll be back at that location!"}
{"text":"I ordered my meal online.  My grilled chicken was very moist and delicious, the garlic mashed potatoes just as good. However, imagine my surprise when I got my $3.50 freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade in 2 separate small children's drinking cups. I was very disappointed about this stunt which detracted from my entire meal and left me thinking about if I should order from them again."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse burger saved the day!  Great weather on a Saturday in February, so my husband I decided to go to happy hour and sit outdoors. We were out running errands, and Gordon Biersch was right in the middle of our route.   We've been here before, but never for happy hour. I was expecting a happy hour on par with other beer-based chain restaurants, like the Yard House or BJs, with half-priced apps and reduced drink prices. While there were a few price reductions, the options seemed a little limited. I opted for a California Cobb flatbread, which was supposed to be $3 off, and my husband stuck to the regular menu and ordered the aforementioned Farmhouse burger.  While my flatbread was fine, my husband was stunned by how flavorful his burger was. The charbroiled burger was topped with bacon jam, tomato, arugula, and a fried egg. To quote him, \"Somebody here knows how to cook an egg.\"  I, for one, hate runny egg yolk, but he is a professional cook, so he knows what he's talking about.  We each had two beers (IPAs for him and white IPAs for me), and they were each $1 off. But I was charged full price for my flatbread. I didn't want to quibble over $3, so I let it slide. But next time an unseasonably warm day pops up, I think I'll just make a few drinks and sit out on my own patio -- unless my husband has a hankering for a Farmhouse burger. I know I can't duplicate that!"}
{"text":"My first visit was so-so. Our server took forever to come to our table and the service in general wasn't so great.   The food was decent, but I expected a little better. We had the steak for our main course and weren't too impressed with it. I will say though that I really enjoyed the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip that we had as an appetizer. Our dessert on the other hand was not good at all and we had to send it back. Stay away from the Strawberry Cheesecake.   The place itself seems like a fun place to go for dinner and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I think I would try it again, but I am hoping to find some better service and better food all around on my next visit."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here.  As usual, I stuck to the burgers and ordered the Marzen bbq burger to split with my husband. We also split an individual California beach taco. (My first time having a fish taco)  I was shocked by the size of the taco. Very small!! Although it was small, it was pretty yummy.  The burger was DELICIOUS! I'm a burger freak and this was by far one of the best burgers I've had in a while. The garlic fries it came with were equally as delicious!!  Our waitress Katie was very nice and entertaining! She went out of our way to make us happy, and that isn't something you find lately in service.  Over all an awesome experience and we will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"We had my daughters 23 birthday dinner at Gorden Biersch. It had been a while since I had been there, I don't know why because I was pleasantly surprised. The service, ambience and food was great! There was a small problem with my sons plate but the manager, who was very pleasant, comp'd his meal and threw in desert. We had a very nice evening, I'm glad my daughter chose Gorden Biersch!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE FAN of this restaurant. The food is always delicious, the services is amazing and I just love the whole experience when I dine there. Their new lemon cake with white chocolate mousse and blueberry sauce is to die for. You have to try it if you go there! Andrew and Scott are super nice and always give me a GREAT service. Make sure to meet Tim the manager, he's really nice."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch with a little bit of soul.   This place is jumping right at noon. So get here by 1130 or so.   My favorite it the live music fromn12 to 3. Live music makes an environment so special. Its like a experience one can only have them self. But it is worth the risk. The prices aren't bad the food is average for brunch on Sunday.  Great for older people who have soul and love music"}
{"text":"Happy to say their HH menu has changed since this review and I can again choose from a great assortment of appetizers.  This place in all other respects earns 5 stars; great servers, great patio and atmosphere, always a favorite destination ... so what a disappointment last week to find they'd changed their previously excellent Happy Hour menu and not for the better!  Their best HH items have all been changed.  I admit to being a picky eater, but I can always find something on a menu anywhere ... not this time. I had to order a sandwich off the regular menu to find something appetizing -- and isn't that what Happy Hours are supposed to promote: appetizers?? Please bring back some of the great pizza options for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised of this place the food was grate and there menu options are German inspired stated off with the bratwurst and pretzel both very tasty the crab dip was just OK would not order again I had the chicken schnitzel it was amazing perfectly cook the breading was lite so you could taste the lemon caper sauce wife had the Bourbon salmon she liked it the sauce make it the service was very good to but we where one of the only tables in the place the only bad thing was the cream brulee it was horrible I couldn't even eat it it mite be my new place over bj Brewery"}
{"text":"Our food was great and our server was awesome. Poor thing had to deal with a hungry table of 13 after Pat's Run.  The manager was kind Enough to bring $5 gift cards to the first timers too. Great way to welcome new customers and bring people back. I'm so happy they were able to accommodate our large party. Thanks Gordon Biersch!"}
{"text":"Went there very late and was surprised to find it was almost empty, started to get a bit worried.  The servers were very friendly and helpful and after some discussion and recommendations we ordered some food and brews.  Sat there sipping beer while talking with the bartender until the food arrived and it was very comfortable for sure.  The food arrived, and it was all good, appetizers, schnitzels, etc.  Maybe because this place is off the strip it is not that busy, but it was near our hotel so it worked out very well for us.  There is fancier and pricier food in Las Vegas for sure, but this place hits the spot just fine!"}
{"text":"my favorite place to relax have a drink and an appetizer. They have a great happy hour! $5 dollar well drinks/martinis/mojitos $3 off wine and $5 appetizers. Cozy atmosphere and some of the nicest staff!"}
{"text":"very good experience  I ordered the GORGONZOLA RIBEYE with Garlic Fries and Asparagus.  The 12 oz grilled boneless ribeye with gorgonzola butter was absolute perfect.  The Garlic fries was amazing too.  Great food, great service in a nice location."}
{"text":"\"Good service with lots' of good beer\"  Good service, great beer, quality food. I had fish oscar. It was very very good and came out very quickly. This is a good place to dine in Las Vegas, without the outragious prices you usually see there. For some reason, LV thinks it can charge 2 1/2 the price you'd expect. This place is an exception. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I really wish they had prices on the cocktails. I wouldn't pay $10 for a large glass of a delicious cocktail, never mind a dribble.  I nearly choked when I saw the bill! My drink was more expensive than what I ordered, which was burnt and dry. SO! If you are looking for a place that has hugely expensive drinks, dry usual food, and oddly posh service for some unknown reason. Then look no further! burning 20 dollar bills?  Do it here ;)"}
{"text":"Applebee's for twice the price. We ended up here because we didn't get a chance to make a reservation at White Chocolate Grill.   Six people got different entrees, and two appetizers...so a lot of items ordered.  Overall theme, very little flavor.  Fish tacos, didn't taste fresh, pretty bland. Castro pub burger, the best entree on the table.  Good flavors, but for the price go to Vogue Burger or Hop Doddy. The other two burgers were soggy, with meat that doesn't fill out the bun.  The appetizer brats were really tasty, but the entree brats were over cooked.    Overall..little flavor, and everything was either over or underdone.   I don't let things like service effect my rating, because that can vary for a lot of reasons, but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and of course a beer. Service was good and would come here again. Thought it was busy since there was hockey game but walked in and their was no wait. Once your done you can walk over to a game or even the outlet stores."}
{"text":"This 4 star review is given in honor of a terrific server/bartender at GB. We were trying to decide where to catch a bite and a beer on a recent weeknight. We ran down the list of our \"go-to\" restaurants in the area. Pizza? Mmm. Pub grub? Mmm. Tacos? Mmmm. Then simultaneously we said \"Let's go see Jenny at Gordon Biersch!\" She always remembers us, our preferences and makes us feel special. Thanks Jenny! You keep us coming back!   (BTW the small sliders (BBQ chicken or farm raised beef) with a side salad and extra crispy fries, \"no garlic\" make a perfect pairing for their famous, consistent Marzen amber beer)"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Marriott and stumbled in for their late happy hour..service was great..food good. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This Gordon Biersch is great. Great food and service! The manager Eddy is why this is my favorite location. He is always on point and you can tell runs the place well"}
{"text":"I had never been here before and when friends suggested it, I did not know what to expect. It was a busy Saturday night but we were able to get a seat at the bar for the four of us. Ordered their crab and artichoke dip...delicious!  The guys shared the Bavarian pretzel and sausage platter and loved it. Service at the bar was great. For dinner I ordered the \"lighter side\" shrimp and mango tacos. Fabulous! My husband had the fish and chips and enjoyed that as well. My girlfriend had the Gorgonzola pear salad which she said was wonderful. Service was good, prices good, wine list good.  I'd definitely go back...the menu is extensive and you can find so many different things. I only say four stars rather than five because it is a chain and does not have that \"Mom and pop\" feel. But we knew that going in."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, so don't hate me for giving me five stars not having drank their beer! We frequented GB when we lived in Vegas, and visited again on a trip back. Gotta' love the variety of food on their menu, and the Happy Hour specials are great. Get the garlic fries - they're awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwesome."}
{"text":"Solidly ok, came in while waiting for a car service appointment.  Lunch was alright, had the Mediterranean chicken, it was a bit crispy, luckily I like it that way otherwise most people would call it dry.    The house produced draft selection is alright too.  Nothing that is go out of my way for but you could do worse.   A bit overpriced though."}
{"text":"It's too bad I didn't bring my phone with me to take a picture of my delicious meal I had here. It's been almost a week and I'm craving some more of those delicious shrimp and lobster tacos. Absolutely amazing! Words cannot describe and they were served with white rice topped with black beans. I will be back for more on my next Vegas Vacation.  I highly recommend this place, service and food was perfect!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place for more than a joint to grab a drink and app.  Unfortunately,  not sure if I can.  Had blue crab artichoke dip....it was good but mediocre.  I had the sausage platter.  Rather disappointing.  Sausages were charred and the ends tasted like I was eating charcoal.  Bacon sauerkraut paquette (sp?) was good.  Good selection of brews and other apps were pretty good.  Like the atmosphere and convenient place to eat while shopping at San tan mall."}
{"text":"Whaddya expect? Well, it's a good middle-level chain restaurant with a lot of noise and activity and decent food. If that's your thing, you'll find this place just fine. I like from time to time, but others better."}
{"text":"I've only been to Gordon Biersch Brewery in Baltimore a few times and Atlanta once.  Every time was a good time.  This time in particular was no different.  My boyfriend and I went to Gordon Biersch for a quick lunch before catching the Cardinals vs. 49ers game.  Ryan was our server.  He was fun, attentive and quick.  To start we ordered the taster size mussels and calamari, pumpkin ale and a Tito's with a splash of cranberry juice.  I feel like the minute we ordered our drinks, Ryan came back with them.  First good sign.  When he came back with our drinks, we ordered appetizers and dinner.  Our appetizer came out within 10 minutes for sure!  No complaints at all!  For lunch, I ordered the grilled Redfish with garlic mashed potatoes and a house salad with blue cheese.  My boyfriend ordered the house made shrimp tacos and sweet potato fries.  They were out of this world good.  Don't get me wrong ... the grilled, buttery, lemon-ny Redfish was great but the shrimp tacos were so good that I wanted to go back the next day to grab some for lunch.  I couldn't but I will.  I really wanted to try the garlic, parmesan fries real bad but my boyfriend love sweet potato fries better.  Ryan was kind enough to bring me an order of the garlic parmesan fries just because he's a sweetheart.  We definitely plan on visiting Gordon Biersch Brewery again and we'll request Ryan's section :)"}
{"text":"I go here frequently for their happy hour. Great beers and the fish tacos are hard to beat! Love this place and the patio!"}
{"text":"Such great service. We have been here a few times and we are always impressed. Have to give big props to the wait staff and the kitchen crew, very professional. Our favorite is the happy hour specials with the appetizers and great drinks (you have to try the southwest egg rolls) if you're looking for a great atmosphere with house brews this is the place to go! Definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Gross. The food was terrible. Our server was nice and did what he could to make things right, but the kitchen was working against him. I suggest someone find better kitchen staff because they're ruining your business."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant for the first time a litte over a month ago. The waitress was very polite and the food was ok, I think it was a bit over-priced for simple dishes. When we were finished, the waitress offered to take our food that was left over to box it up in the kitchen. The next day when I warmed my food up in the kitchen at work, I noticed a piece of glass in the food. Not knowing if there was any more that I was not able to see, I threw the food away and contacted the restaurant to speak to the manager to make him aware. He asked the basic questions like when we came in and who waited on us and what we had to eat so that he could look up the receipt. When he came back on the phone after looking at the receipt, he mentioned that the dining room should have been closed at that time, not sure what that had to do with my complaint. Maybe to kindly tell me that if we had not come at that time to eat, we would not have had the problem?? I don't know. He proceeds to ask what I wanted him to do about it...I would think that he would have had some sort of courtesy in mind already considering he already had me on the phone for almost 10 minutes to do his own research. I asked if he could at least comp the plate that had to be disgarded and he says that he couldn't do that because we had already left the restaurant and it was the next day. He instead offers a $10 gift card for our next visit (I think that only pretty much covered what we left for a tip for the waitress). I was not going to argue with the guy so I just said yeah that's fine. He asked if I wanted to stop by and pick it up or if he should just mail it my house. I asked him to just go ahead and mail it so that I wouldn't have to make the trip down there since it is out of my route from work. Well, this was almost 5 weeks ago and needless to say, he never sent the gift card. I'm more disappointed in the lack of care that he showed for something that could've been hazardous had I not spotted the glass in my food. I will not go back to this restaurant and waste my money there when there are plenty more restaurants that are next to this one that have much better food at more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Lots of Beer.  Great Pretzels. Great mustards.   The PRETZELS were off the hook. Warm soft fresh  Perfect with a cold beer.  Get the sampler just for the Pretzels. I forgot you can smoke at a restaurant.  I don't smoke but I apprciated that my buddy left the table for a while.  On a business trip and I was tired of seeing him. Sorry Jason"}
{"text":"All Day Happy Hour on Sundays - Sunday Funday Anyone?!  Outside of HH, I would not go to Gordon Biersch because it's good, but not great. Both the service and food is inconsistent from location to location, state to state. In downtown Baltimore it's GREAT.  In Westgate it's a hit or miss. I was pleased with both the food and service at this location enough to return on another Sunday.  The cocktails are Steller!  They're really delicious and reasonable priced during Happy Hour.  I ordered 2 Long Island Iced Teas but without Coke, I asked for Sprite instead.  The server said, \"Have you ever tried your Long Island with Cranberry Juice instead of the soda?  If you haven't it's so good!\"  So .. I switched up my order and went with that.  I'm so glad I did!  My partner ordered a drink made with cucumber vodka.  I can't remember the name but it was so light and refreshing.  For food we decided to go with the Legendary Garlic Fries, Nola Yellowfin Tuna to start.  The Nola Yellowfin Tuna was tasty but it was a SUPER small portion. We also ordered California Tacos, and the California Cobb Flatbread.  We probably will not order the California flatbread again - nothing special about it.   We've found a place for Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"The GB is pretty solid. However.. the brewers feast is getting smaller.. I NOTICED!!!! do i get a prize? The feast is shrinking but the price isnt.. seriously i dont care about price and never even mention it until i feel like i got screwed.. the GB.. not a screw job yet.. but in the danger zone.. the meals are getting smaller and the price is the same.. but food is good and the beers are solid. I would reco this joint to most people.. I only complain.. because i want u to notice.... that we notice... go work with your landord and adjust your lease.. dont take it out on the patrons.."}
{"text":"Thought the reviews here were low for this place! I thought was GREAT! Happy hour prices were good the beers were great!!!  THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD!!! LIKED THE AMBIENCE OUTSIDE SEATING WITH A BIG FIRE!!! HAD A GOOD TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Well, for a Saturday afternoon I was curious why there were few customers. Now I know.  The food was a complete disappointment. I started with a stuffed chicken breast accompanied by a quinoa rice pilaf and vegetables. The chicken prep was unexpected. Pre-cut into 4 separate pieces and the sun dried tomatoes mixed in with the cheese was overpowering. Reminded me of a pre-cooked chicken dish you can buy at Costco's freezer section. Their sides did not complement the chicken at all and the pilaf was completely cold. Turns out that's intentional.   Sent this back and went onto Round 2 with the fish and chips selection. This was a complete miss as well. The cod was as tasteless as tofu. I suppose they use a Panko breading to attempt to jazz it up but it was a major fail. The coleslaw was the only thing I enjoyed.   Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Of the cuff decision after visiting the outlets.  Always wanted to dine here when going to Coyotes games in Phoenix but could never get in.  Worth the wait.  This is a brew pub so beer is the beverage of choice and the \"Marzen\" crafted beer was excellent, light with some Caremark and slightly hoppy.  The Cajun taco platter was perfectly spiced and very enjoyable as was the Seafood Cobb salad ( with extra dressing by request). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The good:  We were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter (Jose) was excellent; prompt, professional, personable. He alerted us that the kitchen was running \"a little slow\" so I put in an order for a calamari appetizer before we looked at the menus.   The bad: The calamari...without exception, the worst restaurant offering of calamari I've ever had. To be clear: It arrived hot and was served with two \"sauces.\"  The rings and tentacles were either  \"hard\" or very chewy...depending on whether you picked a thin ring (hard and without flavor of any kind unless you dipped it in the sauce) or if you picked the tentacles, then you got an equally tasteless morsel....only chewy instead of hard.   I'm confident they can find a better supplier of calamari than the one they're using. Restaurant management should be all over this, it is a supplier issue not a cooking or wait staff issue.  My wife ordered the fish and chips, it came out hot and very good. Chips were crisp, fish was battered and crisp without being oily. The portion size was large (she was unable to finish).   I had the lettuce wedge with blue cheese.  You can select either the 1/2 or full portion; I selected the the full. What arrived was a very small wedge of lettuce...I checked to make sure it was the \"full\" portion and was assured that it was.   If I had to guess, I'd say it was 1/6th of a small (not medium) head of lettuce. There was plenty of blue cheese dressing.   We had a side of slaw and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The slaw (very good)  came out with the meal, the waiter advised us that the mashed were not ready but they were working on them. They arrived well after the balance of the food had been served and (mostly) eaten. They were hot and very good...just very late.   Over all, the service was very good (the only fault I found with service was being given the check without being asked if we wanted dessert).  The kitchen was very slow, the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing.  Confusing because the fish portions were larger than expected...the lettuce smaller than expected. The calamari? Unnecessarily poor in quality.  We ordered soft drinks, we did not order alcoholic beverage. The total with tax was $61."}
{"text":"This was the beginning.  Many many moons ago, shortly after I had turned 21, on a trip with the girls and guy to celebrate our newfound glorious world, we arrived at GB. It was a first. We were curious. Asked the waitress what she suggested. Among other things  \"Why not try the glazed chicken wings with honey and ginger?\"  \"Which beer do you recommend with it?\"  \"Try the Marzen.\"  Next, and this is the important part, is the tasting. Take a sip (or two if it pleases you) of beer, a bite through the crispy chicken wings, and another sip of beer. Note how the interaction of the chicken wing sauce pairs PERFECTLY with the beer and brings out subtle flavors and nuances that went previously un-noticed.   My friends, a fascination for beer, finger foods, and more beer begins here.  And, yes, I HAVE heard, and have experienced the sad decline of quality and consistency of GB over the years. *sigh* a painful sight to taste and watch. But, still, your Marzen and wings holds a special place in my heart, even if you do change the sauce."}
{"text":"A very welcoming and friendly staff who will do what they can to make your visit great. I came here with my friend who was visiting from California, and even though she is a bit high maintainence, our server was still friendly and helpful.   The food was good - although I've heard amazing things about their garlic fries, it really wasn't my thing. I did like our pizza, though... we had a yummy roasted chicken and garlic pizza (I guess that's why the garlic fries weren't sp appealing, probably garlic overload). I'd definitely come here again - it's a nice place to hang out and isn't as obnoxious as the other Mill places."}
{"text":"In town for business for a few days, I dined here twice with a group each time. Once for lunch, once for dinner. Good experiences both times, although the food was a little mixed.   For lunch, I went with the German Kobe Beef Burger. It was large, but didn't have a of flavor. There was about a tablespoon of sauerkraut on it as well, which (taste-wise) was about on par with the rest of the burger. Okay, but not a lot of flavor.   Disclaimer: Please take my criticisms of any German cuisine with a grain of salt. I lived there for 11 years and the Germans spoiled me with their cooking. It's not entirely fair for me to compare authentic German food prepared by Germans with our best American shot at the same. Unless they hired a German cook. In which case he should be ashamed of himself...  Okay with that out of the way, let's move on to dinner the following evening, shall we?   I went with the server's recommendation again (I'm doing this a lot lately). She recommended the fish tacos so I went with them.   They were truly outstanding!!!! The absolute best tacos I've had, hands down. I'm not exaggerating, they were really that good. And they even come out on these cool little metal stands that keep your taco upright until you're ready to pick it up and have at it. Pretty nice.   They also came with a side of white rice covered in black beans. Also very good.   And on both occasions the service was impeccable. There's a large dining area and a bar too if you prefer to dine solo like that. Or with a group. It's really up to you.   And there's outdoor seating, too.   All in all, I've been a big fan of Gordon Biersch restaurants everywhere I've gone in the country. And Tempe, AZ, keeps the tradition alive."}
{"text":"Ok so the food here and the beer was actually pretty bomb! It's a bit pricey but it's great food and great drinks. Definitely plan on spending some serious cash! It only got 4 stars from me because of the service. It was.....ok at best. And we even went on a night where it wouldn't be normally busy. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about he menu. But they took forever to do everything!!!! Would recommend. But plan on serious cash and make sure you have the time to spare."}
{"text":"As much as I like beer and good service, of which both GB has plenty of; what I find myself lacking as a patron here is personality - even though I get the feeling that, this is by design and not by accident.   The Food.  You know what, I only had appetizers. I had most of the appetizers on the menu, and nothing had a wow factor. It just wasn't there. Maybe I should come back at another time, but then again for the price I just expect more adventure than a carefully designed meal that doesn't stick out in its defense to please the masses.   The Beer.  Yes I had the Beers. Several from the whole spectrum, and if I had to recommend a malty beverage I'd say I would recommend the Märzenbier (or they call it Märzen). Its color is darker than its taste, but I found it very pleasurable. In fact I think all the beers are worth a sample in this place.   The Service.  I'd say that the service is extremely professional. From the greeter, to the personable waiter/waitress couple that served our party. I CAN believe that the service will depend on the party, and if you look like you are not fitting the desired clientele, you might receive a lesser service. With that said, service for me was great.   The Overall.  For a business casual lunch/dinner meeting, I think this place is THE place. Especially if the client you are trying to grease is a beer drinker (even if they have other very tasty drinks). But for the average guy (me) it is the kind of establishment franchise I am actively trying to avoid. It's too bland for me, and the price for stated blandness is too high. If I only consider service then I would be all for it, but I am a foodie so I can't stand behind that."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices. I've never had a bad meal, but I've never been amazed. The beer, however, is awesome. I love the czech pilsner!"}
{"text":"Hostess literally gave a stuck up attitude when we asked to have better seats for our group."}
{"text":"Normally I love Gordon biersch.  This location has got to be the worst.  Bar service was ok but one we got seated I had to ask a host for a server after 15 minutes of waiting.  Zero apology.  My husband asked for a refill on water, she refilled his but did not refill mine which was more than half empty. His burger was cold and rare when he ordered medium well. Honestly this is the most horrible service, food, experience ever."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Had the Czech Pilsener and the lager Export. Great taste, right temperature   The Chicken schnitzel is in fact Chicken picata recipe. Great taste, good portion size  The sausage plate comes with sauce and good mustard   Love the location and interior Overall good brewery experience. 4.2pnts"}
{"text":"\"meh\" is a good sound to make when someone mentions GB.  Their food is ok, better than a crappy chain restaurant, but still way under par for a brewpub.  Their beer is weak on all levels.  They have a bunch of low alcohol, light colored, low malted, low hopped beer.  I couldn't recommend this to anyone looking for good beer.  ....meh"}
{"text":"The food and beer are always good and the service is outstanding. I had a problem with my order and they fixed it right away without any questions."}
{"text":"Food: fantastic Beer: amazing Service: atrocious. Glad the servers have the time to sit in the kitchen and chit chat while their customers are out of drinks.  We'll be back for the food and beer, but servers should note that while reward good service with generous tips, poor service leads to tiny tips...."}
{"text":"The food is always very good. I had the lettuce wraps which were different than I am used to as they had strips of chipotle chicken and were delicious! Would definitely order them again!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars because at least our server understood that we had a terrible experience from start to finish and let us leave free of charge.   We ate here about a year ago and had great food so we gave it at try over this past weekend again. It took forever for anyone to even come to our table that when they finally did we placed our entire drink and food order at once. Our drinks then proceeded to take forever to arrive but did after about 15 minutes. And we just ordered fountain drinks and water, very easy stuff.   So then we waited and waited and waited for our food, and we had a hungry 5 year old too. And waited some more, finally our server comes over and says \"sorry the kitchen is backed up today\". (This place was not busy at all) it was late afternoon. So after about an hour our food comes out and its cold, the food runner spills soup on my seat and onto her thumb and back into the bowl as she was holding my soup. Gross. And then never cleans up the soup off my seat. Anyway, everything was luke warm but the topper was our child's \"chicken tenders\". One piece was small and crunchy and had very little meat in it, the other piece was huge and perfectly rounded. So I bit into that one and it wasn't even chicken! Reminded me more of a hush puppy. So we were just so done with this meal by now and flagged down our server. He had no explanation for the weird chicken or anything else, so I asked for our bill and he just told us to leave.   So we sat there for over an hour and received nothing that we could actually eat. Good times...."}
{"text":"Good BBQ pizza and the beer sampler. prefect meal."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on Sunday after a visit to the Apple Store next door. My wife and I opted for the special, mahi-mahi with rice and asparagus. The rice was fluffy ( not sticky) and the fresh asparagus was a delight! Not overdone, but nice, fresh, and loaded with natural sugars and cooked in olive oil! The mahi-mahi was topped with a bruschetta of tomato, olives, seasonings, with a base of olive oil. Deeeeelicious! My wife had the Czech micro brew but I did a diet Coke as I was the driver. Pricing moderate, atmosphere casual and quiet. Service excellent."}
{"text":"Really great menu. Mini brats and sliders on appi menu were to die for.  Great service also."}
{"text":"This place is always friendly and my big group of friends and I always have a good meal. I've yet to have a sub par experience. I love the grilled chicken breast with veggies, moist and flavorful. Desserts are always good and some come in half portions which is helpful. The outdoor area is great to sit by, especially when it's cold and the fireplace is roaring."}
{"text":"I love their seared Ahi.  Good place to go if you have a group.   It's cool to sit out on the balcony and people watch on Mill."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this restaurant. It was too hot to eat outside, but I did notice that they have water misting over the patio area. If I hadn't been wearing jeans in 90 degree weather, I would have tried it. I sat down in the bar and immediately ordered a beer sampler. It's 5 brews for $5, but there is always a \"server's choice\" so you actually get 6 samples. I told the server to make all the selections and I can honestly say that there wasn't a beer I didn't enjoy. Then I ordered their Octoberfest special, which was a selection of sausages and olives grilled, matched with cheeses and breads, and a side of pickled vegetables. Who pickles celery!? They do, and it's scrumptious. I was stuffed. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I only wish this was in my home town, I can guarantee I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Hello peeps today hubby and I enjoyed the house chopped salad loaded with chicken , avocado, chickpea,tomatoes,and blue cheese lightly crumbled. We split French dip sliders (amazing) . Services was dead on, friendly . Casual attire , bill very affordable . If you have not gone give it a shot . As always if you go let me know , enjoy"}
{"text":"Bartenders are amazing and always on top of thier game. Great place to stop in and have a beer after work."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying, I am not a picky person at all! I will eat just about anything as most times I have no choice:) I Ordered to go through Postmates... It was awful! The tomatoes on my wedge salad were literally mush because they were so old, I could eat any of the salad because I was afraid to get sick. Gross! The steak was ok but I couldn't eat that either because of the tiny, cheap plastic utensils, the kind you would probably get from a gas station. I did go down to the lobby of my hotel and get 'real' plastic utensils, the food was cold by then. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Great location with a good sized menu with plenty to choose from. Good selection of drinks plus they do their own brewing . Service was good and fast and the server tended to all of our needs quickly. Only 4 stars because we all wanted to start with the tomato soup but they only had 2 bowls left at 6 pm?!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with this place. It always used to be so good when I came in but last night was no bueno :( The cheese curds was the best thing I ate. I ordered a Heffewisen beer and it tasted old or something. The Marzen BBQ burger was alright but I was really hoping for a great burger and it came up short. Also tried the bread pudding. Could have been better. My dad also got ripped off. He ordered the shrimp and lobster tacos and it was supposed to come with 3 and he only got 2. Didn't find that out until after we left. Also, his brussel sprouts were hard as a rock when he got them so he ordered something else. Waiter was great though! but probably won't be back :("}
{"text":"I love Gordon Biersch! I wish there was one closer to me. Came on a Friday for Happy Hour and it was packed. They have a happy hour menu with specials (drinks & food). I ended up ordering a couple of grapefruit mules for ~$6 each. Unfortunately their famous garlic fries were not on the happy hour menu but they are sooo good, I got them anyway. Service was good despise the large crowd. I also learned that they have ALL DAY happy hour on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"We moved to Tempe Town Lake & we were at Biersch almost daily to meet friends, family, have burger & a few beers, & enjoy the patio.  The food is just eh people go here for the beer & patio.We thought this would be a great place to spend our New Years Eve. I called a week in advance to check on my reservation I had made the week before and they could not find it.  I called days in advance to check on the reservation again they did not see the res that I had made twice.  I literally called hours before the event to check on my res and guess what? They couldnt find it.  I spoke with the mgr it was a man and I dont recall the name unfortunately.  He told me that I could not make a res for the night that they were not taking any.  I told him I had just spoken with one of the girls 30 minutes prior & that I was getting a head count & confirming my guests & I was now calling back to confirm.  He said ok in that case he would take my res.  I had such an uneasy feeling about this whole thing so I called again about an hour before we were to show up and OMG they still could not find a reservation for us.  I am not kidding.  The girl took the res and assured me it would be fine.  We show up go to the hostess and ask for our reservation for 12 they said they did not have a res for us.  Again not joking.  I stood there in complete disbelief but kept my calm & just tried to get to the bottom of it.  There were 4 young hostesses standing in front of us & none of them could find this reservation.  I looked over their little podium and could see my name scribbled on their reservation paper so I pointed to it & said isnt that it?  The first hoestess said oh, the second oh, the third oh, the 4th said oh.  It was like an SNL skit.They set up a table for us near the window as requested.  When we first got there we only had 4 of our 12 people because others were on their way & we had arrived an hour early in case we ran into problems which we did.  Not even 5 minutes after we were seated a group of people walked up and stood near our table looming over us looking at us weird and then the groups spokesperson came over this guy was a Tony Soprano type & he said Hey is this your table? I said are you serious right now?  He says ya how do you know this is your table?  Lets see we made a \"reservation\" and we are sitting here.  Is this happening right now?  This guy was pissed.  He told us to get up and move and hes got 12 people standing behind him.  He said this isnt your table this is my table I made a reservation.  I told the guy to go take a flying leap and leave us alone.  He bitched and moaned loudly that the waitress told him we were randoms and that we just walked in and sat ourselves. He wouldnt shut his face.  I did my best to ignore the idiot.  Our waitress came over and apologized for this idiots behavior and the waitress that said we just sat ourselves. The idiots party was sat near our table where they taunted us all night toasting to us in the most negative ways you could think of.  All of us tried to just ignore it.  They were telling the server they were rolling on E and then she would come over and tell us about it.  We stepped out to the balcony to watch fireworks around 10 and the idiots were out there.  I thought I could easily ignore it and get along but they were all psycho drunk and drugged out and still going on and on about us taking their table it was beyond nuts so I just said hey lets get past this and have a good time.  They seemed to take that well until one of the men from our party stepped out to the patio. All the idiots ganged up on him got in his face and one of our other guys tried to step out to save him but they stopped the door from opening with their feet.  Panic set in for me and I tried to push my way out there to break up the insanity.  Somehow we settled it all down before something happened but those guys were threatening us.  Our guys went back in and sat down.  Just before midnight I stepped out to the patio again to see what was happening on the street and that party of people was again out there smoking and insane going on and on about us and how they were kicked out.  We had nothing to do with it I had no idea they were kicked out.  I went to the bathroom and while I was in there WE were also kicked out.  When we first arrived I had asked our server to split up the check and asked will that be a prob she said no.  I was also going to use my Biersch card to get the points but when they kicked us out they turned into A HOLES they would not split the bill and they wouldnt take the Biersch card.  I tried to speak to management on my way out to tell them the insanity we endured all night and the injustice of kicking us out as well.  She could give a crap.  So we went from almost everyday customers that brought 20 people with us on many occasions to none of us have been there since we are all spreading the word and boycotting this joint.  All of that was Bierschs fault. IDIOTS"}
{"text":"My favorite of the LV locations! We enjoy the happy hour here, for after work get togethers. Can get really busy on the weekends so we don't come as often as we would like. But these are some of my fav's~  Starters: Tapas* roasted garlic, bruschetta, olive tapenade and hummus with herb flatbread Crispy artichoke Hearts* topped with Parmesan and lemon aioli Salads: Salmon Caesar Salad with Parmesan croutons Hummus and Goat Cheese Salad* over warm herb flatbread with Märzen Vinaigrette (add chicken or salmon and is a great entree) Pizza: Roasted Garlic & Chicken Pizza with a white sauce, roasted garlic, and pulled chicken breast  Just heard about this: Can't wait to try on my next visit!!!! Wasabe Sake-infused VODKA?!?!? YAY!!!!! *****Homemade Bloody Mary  Our homemade Bloody Mary mix with ABSOLuT PEPPAR Vodka or WASABÉ Saké-infused Vodka*****"}
{"text":"Steak Fritas are awesome. Service was a bit slow but that was due to the waitress getting double sat. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was open and comfortable."}
{"text":"As frequent GB patrons I am sad to say tonight may be our last visit for a long, long time. First, the prices have been steadily increasing over the past couple years. There are so many other choices at San Tan Mall. there is really no reason to spend the extra money for a subpar experience. Tonight we used a survey coupon with a $10 value toward an appetizer. We have used the same type of offer for $10.00 off two entrees instead of the appetizers before, no problem. Actually, the first time the waiter in the bar area (not the bartender) suggested that we go that route. Offering the additional tidbit, \"We do it all of time\". Score. Tonight the manager came over to us and told us that is not allowable and it would not be honored. She apologized multiple times and said it was allowed the other 2 times but no more.  I replied that she wasn't that sorry and no one ever said it was a problem, hence the reason we were using that same practice. The manager said that they would honor it \"...one last time...\". I informed our regular bartender that it would be honored and he told the couple next to me, \"...I'm just following the rules...\". Our bartender never spoke a word about it to us, which would have been the right thing to do. We are regulars at this GB and we are disappointed. Yes, we did get what we wanted but the experience left us feeling undervalued as a long-term customer."}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant and had 5 out of 6 wonderful dinners and great service by Andrew. The fish & chips was  like frozen fish sticks. Cajuan pasta salmon,  mac & cheese pasta , and chicken skewer dishes were excellent. The Heffe beer was the best on the west coast.  I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Had some of the happy hour dishes.  While I didn't have the kobe sliders, they didn't look very appetizing.  Calamari was a bit too oily and the squid was a bit too mooshy, as opposed to a slight crunch.  For my main dish I got the seared tuna.  It was a bit sub par.  Seemed like it was frozen and forced to thaw a bit too quickly.  The raw portion of the tuna was too squishy and broke apart like it wasn't supposed to.  The taste seemed a bit off.  I had to dip it in the wasabi cream which killed whatever flavor the tuna had, which made it consumable.  The green bean sides were too hard and crunchy."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential however the attitude of the female servers coupled with the inefficiency of the kitchen with timing during a rush is bringing this place down. I was in Arizona for a conference in Glendale at the arena which is about a 10 minute walk from this place. My colleague and I made reservations through OpenTable for lunch to ensure we could get in and get sat and eat and get back to the conference on time considering there was over 10,000 people at the conference. We entered for our 12:30 reservation at 12:25pm the female hostess was very unwelcoming however Martin and Kenny were nearby and extremely friendly and accommodating. We were offered a HighTop table in the bar area (worst decisions EVER). Our waitress came over PIST and the only reason I can think she was acting such a way is because of the rush and they didn't get the memo that our organization was in town and it would be super busy. My colleague mind you is pregnant and we nicely let the server know that we were on a lunch break and we would like to order soon. She rolled her eyes and said okay and walked away only to return about 10minutes later. We ordered: Mushroom app Shrimp Mango taco Side Salad  FastForward 49 minutes later, WE HAVE NO FOOD. We ask our server several times and she says \" it's busy\" we are like \"ok we understand that but a side salad and a shrimp mango taco appetizer and mushrooms don't take that long\" She disappeared again for 20 minutes, now we have been here for over an hour with no water, no drinks and no food. I walked up front and spoke to Martin who immediately grabbed Kenny who magically got us our food in the next 6 minutes and comped our bill. This was nice however we lost all the time we had for lunch and to take a walk waiting on 3 small items for over a hour. The food however was AMAZINGLY good which is why we returned the next day for dinner in hopes that the staff was different and to our liking it was. David the host was the FUNNIEST and our server MATT was a true ACE. For dinner we had Lobster tacos and chicken tacos which both were so fulfilling and flavorful. Again the food is good and the service is HIT or MISS, all the people I listed are AMAZING but the women there are just OFF."}
{"text":"Decided to try it again after a long hiatus. Excited to see Halibut($20), this is what I got; A 2in x 2in piece of leather, actually need a steak knife to cut it Raw Asparagus, no seasoning or flavor, good thing I had the steak knife \"Home made chips\" we're stale and cold Wife's green beans also uncooked. I don't know, maybe I'm hitting chefs with attitudes. We will never try again. Location is the only thing keeping the doors open, plenty of alternatives close by, like The Keg."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is so slow.... A bad combination of short staffed kitchen and few waitresses...I walked out still hungry because there was so much time between dishes (As a group of 5 we decided to share 6 dishes). Cajun Pasta was good."}
{"text":"Always like the food and drink selection served at Gordon Biersch.  The problem no matter which location I go to is the lack of service.  The get-together that was planned with a group co-workers was no exception, and this latest experience is what I'm writing about.  The boyfriend and I got there around 5:30PM, and they didn't seem busy, especially in the patio area where we were all seated. We were able to put in a drink order, but received them about 15 minutes later, and was also missing 1 water that was requested alongside the coffee porter. We were with the group for about an hour - a time frame in which I only managed to get and finish 1 drink order in. Although I honestly did want to put in a food order. Managed to be able to flag our server for the check, but I did have one co-worker literally go to the bar to request his check because it had been too long before we saw any server come to the table.  Maybe I'll just order at the bar ahead of time and request it be brought to the table like a fellow co-worker did."}
{"text":"My first time dining here and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The food was great and the beer was as well.  The staff was very friendly.  They really made us feel at home.  I was with a friend and we had a leisurely discussion over drinks and dinner.  It was a great atmosphere, enjoyably not too loud.  Not rushed but our server was there when we needed him."}
{"text":"Solid choice. The beers and service were 5 stars, but food was 4. Food was still good, but not great which is why only a four star review. Outdoor patio seating gives a great view of Mill Street. Overall I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place has a really good happy hour! And the drinks are good. On the weekends it can get a little crowded but that's ok because I love the drinks. I also am a fan of the brownie!!! Like I usually always order that by the end of the night. I used to go in there very often so they knew me, but I don't live in Phoenix anymore so I don't go. But I would recommend this place even though it's on Mill and I hate Mill. This place is a good spot for drinks and relax mingling."}
{"text":"Food was great as always, but the service is a little lack luster. Got the wrong drinks a couple of times and the staff in general is not very courteous."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, beer rocks, food is excellent. The atmosphere is really cool, and the service is perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  We've been coming here for years and are members of their reward club.  The food and beer are delicious...all day HH on Wednesday with great prices."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait in an hour line at the Cheesecake Factory next door, go here. Always good food and beer."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with their appetizers and sliders. My boyfriend and I split a lot of different dishes, because we felt munchie and didn't want a whole meal. We ordered the French dip sliders, garlic fries, bratwurst sliders, and Southwest rolls. We both agreed that the garlic fries and Southwest rolls were our favorite. We were shocked at how fresh and not greasy all of our food was. Even the garlic fries weren't greasy, which is usually a norm for garlic fries.presentation of the food was excellent. You could tell someone took their time in putting it all together. The price was reasonable, too. Our waitress was friendly and refilled both of our glasses right before they were empty. The atmosphere was inviting and a great place for families, couples, and a group of friends. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I, like many others, do not know what the fuss is about this place. The beer is fine, yes, but the prices are ridic (over $4 for a pint), the service is slow, and the food is not worth the prices.   The garlic fries are okay but used to be much better, and is the only reason I give it more than one star. The service last time we had was horrible- I had to wait five minutes to eat because I didn't have silverware and the waiter never came by.   My husband had lobster bisque. I HATE seafood, and he convinced me to try the bisque because he said he couldn't taste any lobster. He was right. My bread on the avocado and chicken sandwich was completely dry. We both didn't finish our meals.   The first time I ate here it was fine, and I've tried it two more times and each time am dissatisfied, so I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I had the burger & garlic fries and it was very good.  Best burger I've had in quite a while.  I also enjoyed the marzen beer and couldn't get over how cheap it was.  Will definitely go back if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"On a not so busy Wednesday night we (party of four) were seated right away. No server approached us for 10 minutes, not even a busser or hostess bringing water.  We went back the front desk to ask for help. When a server finally arrived she apologized for being the bathroom. Why would the hostess seat us in a server's area who was on break? We came primarily for the beer and they were out of seasonal/specialty beers. Disappointed, I settled for the Marzen which was fine. From that point service was fine. I was looking forward to the Farmhouse Burger with Bacon Jam and fried egg. I ordered Medium and got very well done. Same with my wife. There was no evidence of bacon jam. The burger had very little flavor (probably for being overdone)"}
{"text":"We love coming here for happy hour!  The grass fed sliders are good and the southwest eggrolls are yummy!  And, of course, you have to get garlic fries!   Service is always great and you can almost always get right in with no wait.  We like to make reservations on Opentable if we are going at a busy time or with a big group!"}
{"text":"The highly touted garlic fries were a let down. The meal otherwise was just a normal chain standard meal. It was good but for me not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place, and they have one of my favorite all time beers, Marzen.  I usually go to this place prior to the Coyotes games, and of course, so do a lot of other people.  But the great thing is, even though the place is going to be packed, they still have happy hour (and HH prices) right before the game.   For less money than going inside Jobing to eat, I get great beer, great food, with great service in a nice sit down restaurant.  And yes, even thought the place is packed with hockey fans, you still get great service.  The wings, calamari, garlic, tacos, and almost all HH food is great.  Even though it is a chain, it is still one of my all time favorites brewery restaurants."}
{"text":"We have been here many times to our visits to Phoenix and was no different last week. We keep going for the food, beer and especially the service. Beer very good, had a few seasonals, food is better than average, service is excellent. If the weather is nice they have a patio with TVs."}
{"text":"Let's go for a burger and beer !!  We decided to visit Gordon Biersch only because I wanted some good beer. We waited about 15 minutes and finally seated.  I orderd a Hefewiezen and the beer was great except for the taste of the sanitizer rinse that lingered on the glass. I drank it anyway. I unfolded my napkin and noticed dried food on the utensils and politely requested clean ones, I didn't want to Biersch about it. I ordered a wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles and bacon, it was alright, could have been better if they were not so cheap with the dressing. I didn't want to Biersch about it. The cold loaf of bread should have been warm ?? I didn't Biersch about it. My dining partners lobster bisque should be renamed tomato soup with cooking sherry flavor, no lobster here. She did Biersch and I had to settle her down. We both ordered burgers, different of course, and I requested well done fries, the fries were well done and GREASEY because the cook reheated some fries that were already cooked !! The tomato slice on both burgers were wilted and mushy, I didn't Biersch about that either. A little bit of shredded, wilted lettuce dressed up the hamburger bun, could have been more fancy if the burger had some sliced onion and a pickle would have made my day. I did not Biersch. The waitress never asked if I wanted another beer, sort of glad she didn't, sanitizer isn't that good. When we left the hostess asked us how everything was and I gave her a thumbs down, I assumed that the manager was standing next to her and he said to me \" Why didn't you say something\", I just told him that  if I had complained it would have been taken like I wanted my meal for free. I didn't want to seem like a Biersch. I won't be going back to Gordon Blah anytime soon !!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying this review has nothing to do with the service. Our waitress Chelsie was awesome and a great server. Alright, so down to the review. I have been going to this location since 2009 or earlier, maybe once every few months at least. Today's experience was a HUGE letdown with the food. It is a Monday today, and generally a pretty slow day in the industry. It was no different tonight, maybe only a few tables seated in the dining room. I absolutely love the beer mushroom chicken on the menu, with the amazing mashed potatoes it comes with. I ordered that and my wife ordered the California club sandwhich. 10 minutes after our server comes back and says that they are out of mashed potatoes... um okay I guess I'll order something else then, it's a random fluke right? I chose the Cajun pasta and since I saw my wife's sandwhich in the window I asked that they bring that over at least. She tried the sandwhich and they have definitely changed their grilled chicken, I tried it and it taste exactly like the frozen grilled chicken patties from Costco. Really? My pasta came and not only was it bland, it was covered on top with a \"Cajun\" spice that was 70% salt. Couldn't even eat it.   I used to love Gordon Biersch, they have great beer and at one time had great food. I used to like it so much it was the last place I chose to eat at before I went to Air Force basic training, that's how much I used to like it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know what it's like since I made a reservation 8 hours in advance and two hours before they cancelled it. Not even a reason or courtesy call. Guess my money wasn't good enough lol."}
{"text":"This 1 star is because the service was good, but the food? Bleck. When I lived in the Bay Area GB could always be counted on for great beer and very good food. while the beer here was still good (but no longer special with a zillion craft breweries), the food was TERRIBLE as was the food presentation: sweet potato fries were under cooked, a very small portion for an appetizer we were sharing with a glob of garlic on top, not tossed with it; my waygu beef hamburger was dry, not hot and over cooked and my salad vinaigrette definitely came out of a can. Skip it."}
{"text":"Late in the evening with a bad case of the munchies we were greeted by a nice friendly server and ordered 4 things from the happy hour menu but all 4 of them fell as flat as a cow pie on a warm afternoon. Great Beers and great reverse happy hour from 9PM to close and everyone is entitled to a bad night so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. This was the night before Thanksgiving so the kitchen staff may have been more concerned about cleaning up and going home than cooking hot and fresh food. Calamari was cold and greasy, Burgers cold and greasy, so greasy in fact I ended up ruining a brand new pearl buttoned shirt as I tipped the Kobe beef slider to my lips and drained out at least 2 oz of beef juice right down my neck. Fries cold and stale and the list goes on.. The server was plenty friendly and efficient but the food left us with a real buzz kill and that not so pretty feeling when you walk around with a grease stain the size of Texas on your shirt."}
{"text":"Farmhouse Burger aka something memorable about my Arizona trip.   You know that part in the relationship where you're just starting out? The part where it's talking and butterflies? You know, before he shows you who he really is, and makes you wanna run home, lock your door, and hide under your covers forever? The beginning, where you have no idea he's a psycho and he treats you like a princess? This burger is so much better than that!   I went to Gordon Biersch to eat, not to fall in love. But hey, two birds, one burger. I think I went with my mom and cousins. By \"I think\" I don't mean we all got so wasted that I don't remember. By \"I think\" I mean I THINK there were people, I KNOW they were talking, but I was too distracted by the orgasms that were happening via my taste buds.    Let me paint this picture for you: Bacon jam. Need I say more? No? Well I'm going to. Arugula, roasted tomatoes, mustard sauce, and a juicy beef patty topped with a fried egg, and don't forget the garlic fries! Are we absolutely sure lust and gluttony are deadly sins? I'm looking into it. Apologize in advance to everyone for the inappropriate noises you will be making while consuming. Not to be made in front of small children. You have been warned.  PS. I accept thank-you's in the form of Visa, MasterCard, or Pay Pal."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with great beer and good food. The patio is pretty cool and you can usually get a quick seat if you are a passport member, that was the best $20 I ever spent. You cannot go wrong with the pulled pork sandwich, the mushroom burger or their pizza. They usually have decent fish that is on their specials menu, buy you have to remember that this is a beer company, so don't get too crazy. I usually hit this place up a few times a month and I am usually happy when I leave.  GREAT BEER!"}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer! If you like those things, you'll like Gordon Biersch. The craft beer is good... the Hef is my favorite so if you see me there, you now know what to send me! Cheers"}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month.........food always good and desserts like the warm apple bread pudding and triple chocolate brownie are AWESOME!   Garlic Fries are killer too.   I really can't complain about anything........rewards are pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"I highly recommend you sign up for the Gordon Biersch Passport Program. It's free and they send you TONS of discounts via email.  Beyond the deals, this restaurant has GREAT food (I really like their burgers), good Happy Hour deals, decent-good service, and a really cool patio to hang out on.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Alongside with my last review... This seems to be a common meeting place for our circle of friends, and it seems between the all of us, we try all of their draft beers. I love this, and I must say, their hefe, is breathtaking. I'd like one right now, lol Again, lobster bisque amazing, great sangria with marinating fruit chunks!!  They do have a last call so...you've been warned."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  The restaurant is very attractive and we appreciate that they take reservations, however, the food is inconsistent.  Several months ago I had the  Spicy Asian Chicken Bites and they were very good.  When I had them the other evening there was so much spice it made them inedible.  I would never order them again. The draft beer menu is rather confusing and none of the servers we have had can explain the beers offered, nor do they offer you a taste to see if you like it.   In all of our visits we have never had an  memorable experience.  The servers all seem to have an indifferent attitude -- as if they could care less that you are there.  Overall, a lackluster restaurant with mediocre service."}
{"text":"After hearing buzzwords from friends such as \"free beer\", I decided to go to GB's Sommerbrau keg tapping party. My expectations were greatly exceeded! I stroll in and wait in line to get drink/raffle tickets with my seriously pregnant sister (more beer for me!). The place is packed, the line is long but extreme efficiency is being used. Our friends saved us a seat at the outside section of the bar which is hard for five, but we make do. It's summer and scorching hot but the breeze from the AC kept the outside diners cool. A bartender immediately comes over and gets our drink order, notes happy hour food specials and drinks come quick.   Happy hour is great at $5 - $7 apps and $2 off beers/wine = $3 for a good beer. I'm drinking the free beer which is light and delicious! They also were giving out free bruschetta and their signature garlic fries (a must!). Sister and I share the tapas plate ($5) which was very tasty. A generous amount of humus, fresh tomatoes with herbs, a fantastic olive spread and lots of  roasted garlic cloves with pita. We didn't even finish it due to fullness. Our friends got a heaping plate of the house made chips with bacon, cheese, and onions. Looked good as well! We didn't win the raffle but the two girls I was with each won $50 gift cards at the last tapping party. They had several good prizes!  I was there for four hours and spent $3 + a nice tip for our attentive bartender for 3 tasty brews and food. I will be back to pay them real money and try their other brews very soon!   If you join their e-mail list located on the website you will receive an appetizer coupon ($10 value). They also have a GB card you can get for the VIP treatment and to get points for free things!"}
{"text":"They have new menu for vegetarian and the vegetable pasta was great.  I asked to prepare on the lighter side and it's still very flavorful.  Service is amazing. The potstickers might have steamed couple minutes too long.  My friend ordered the pull pork sandwich and I could resist the french fried."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and a friendly welcome but then it went down hill.  I wanted seafood and asked the server for her recommendation. She recommended the salmon and it was very dry and tough.  I would have sent it back, however, we hardly ever saw her after getting our food. Very disappointed that they would serve a dish like that.   Drinks were rarely refilled (maybe once in 1.5 hrs.).  It's too bad, a couple of months ago I ate there for the first time and had a fruit and nut salad and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Maybe just a bad night....but it was really a bad night."}
{"text":"We are regulars and have tried several things on their menu!  I have yet to have anything that I don't like.  Also if you are a fan of brewry beer...good place to go.  The atmosphere is upbeat and the service has always been fast and friendly!  Great place for lunch/dinner or happy hour.  We have taken several friends and family here when they come to visit and no complaints!!!"}
{"text":"While trekking to the neighborhood Apple store, we thought we might give this place a try.  Being that it was happy hour, DH and DS and I took a hi-top table in the bar and settled down looking for some good food (we could smell those burgers everywhere in San Tan Village!).  DH ordered the Asian Fusion combination platter which had Southwestern Egg Rolls, Chinese Potsticker, and Tempura Shrimp.  At $11, it was a little pricey but it was a decent portion for a dinner and would have been a shareable appetizer for 2 or 3.  Presentation was nice and the sauces were tasty.  DS ordered the BBQ burger which was a nice sized burger. Interestingly they didn't ask how he wanted it done which meant in my world, I was having nothing to do with it. I can't stand a well or medium-well burger and that is exactly what they served up. And it came with a pile of garlic fries.  The verdict is still out on those.  DS, who lives for anything garlic, even remarked that they were just a little to heavy-handed with the garlic seasoning on them.  Oh - and one other thing that just slayed me - yellow mustard!  In this day and age of $11 burgers, please chef, freaking offer something other than yellow mustard!  It is like setting a table with the best china and linens and then giving someone a plastic fork - there is a time and place for yellow mustard, but not on anything other than fast food.  DS and I both had  the Lobster Bisque.  At $4.50 a cup, I had high expectations.  Wow. Such a disappointment.  It arrived with a swirl of sour cream on top so I had high hopes at the start but......there was nothing in it. Not a speck of lobster. Yes, it was rich, Yes, it was creamy.  But NOTHING in it. It was lobster-flavored bisque.  Oh, wait, yes, there were some lumps in it - not sure if it was some roux that had not been whisked in (doubtful) or more likely the pot scum that you get with cream sauces. So this is off my recommended list - if you are going to have bisque, put something in it besides soup base and white sauce - heck, I can get that from a can of Campbells.....  I ordered the Turkey combo (1/2 turkey sandwich, and a soup or salad) opting for the house salad.  Interestingly enough, DH ordered a house salad on the side - his came with spiced pecans and way more cheese so realize this is not a full house salad included in the combo.  The turkey 1/2  sandwich came with watercress mayo which was heavily laden with garlic (it tasted oddly like one of the sauces DH got with his platter - I think it was just the overwhelming garlic flavor that made everything taste alike).The sandwich was a decent portion and was not a bad deal with the salad for the price but I ended up eating it without 1/2 of the toast since that mayo was just - well, for lack of a better term - gross.  It was too overwhelming of a flavor with the mild turkey.  I'd recommend asking for it on the side and deciding yourself.  Service - well, that left a lot to be desired. It was happy hour and the place was dead except for the bar.  Asking for dressing on the side of the salad was ignored. Could not get extra napkins or much attention at all.    All in all - it was okay. Nothing I would go out of my way for.  Our bill for three, including tip, was $64. That included one beer, one soda, and the above food. I thought a little overpriced.  So next Apple visit, we will venture and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I tried GB Beer years ago and couldn't stand it - and I'm a pretty unpicky alcoholic. Just not my thing. Went here to give the restaurant a chance and didn't care much for it here either.   I'm not super needy, but when it takes 5 minutes to even have someone get your drink order... then another 3 to get your drink to the table that is entirely too much time. The food was OK."}
{"text":"I love this place! Not much of a beer fan, but I mus say the marzen was really good.   Great burgera nd the garlic fries are out f this world!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and timely. The beer was tasty and cold. The wait staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Overall a good atmosphere: low key brew house which is right up our alley."}
{"text":"I think this was the first restaurant we ate at when we came here house-hunting. We loved it, and have been back many times since.  Their Miersden(sp?) is awesome! As are the garlic fries. I don't think we've had anything there that wasn't very good.  By chance, a few friends and us ended up there for happy hour one Friday. They had some great specials, and we've been looking forward to visiting for another HH.  And just the view from the balcony is awesome. I love looking down on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"An upscale restaurant and brewery. Loss of star for price of food and lacklusterness of restaurant. Nothing about this place encourages me to come again or make it a regular spot.   Enjoyed this place for several get togethers. They can accommodate large groups and take reservations. Food and beer I've gotten has been ok, just overpriced and small portions."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow and the waiter and bartenders ignored our group.   I have eaten here once more before and did not have the best experience. I was reluctant to go back but my friends are new to the area and wanted to try it out.  The atmosphere is very nice though."}
{"text":"My parents stopped by campus when they arrived in Phoenix to take me out for lunch.   Their flight was a little delayed so that put us in a little bit of a time crunch as I had a little over an hour to eat and get to class.  We informed our server of this as soon as we sat down and they were very accommodating.  About 5 minutes after we placed our orders our food was on our table.  The Caesar salad was standard (I'm not really  a fan of creamy Caesar dressing)  but my father did enjoy his pulled pork sandwich.  While the food was nothing out of this world the lunch was quick and served its purpose and I would definitely return based on that."}
{"text":"I had dinner at GB this past Wednesday with a corporate work group of 25-30 people and had a wonderful evening! I was hesitant they would be able to accommodate our group because I was given short notice but was able to make a reservation the evening before. Knowing very well what to expect from GB, I dealt with a young lady named Becca who made my whole experience so great that I had to hop online to write up a review! Becca was incredibly helpful by answering all my questions and assured me the server would be notified and able to give us all separate checks (ugh so annoying I know, but corporate insisted on it for individual expense reports). The evening was a breeze and because of her willingness to deal with us, all 25 of us are expecting to return when we all meet back up in town. While I'd assume this location is generally busy with its' location to the stadiums, it's nice to know this customer service still exists and we all walked away talking about our great experience well into the next day during training! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. We're not beer drinkers, but the food was very good. Staff extremely pleasant but not pushy. We come to this area of town often. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Based upon the texture, taste, color, and preparation the ahi tuna appeared to me to be more like albacore tuna. But the beer was as expected."}
{"text":"IBeer is great but a bit overpriced and their food although described very nicely falls short.   My friend's grilled fish and veggies were over cooked and and bone dry while my flatbread main meal  was appetizer sized though tasty.  Service was good enough.  Felt to commercialized/corporate with too much hoopla for my taste"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely dinner, an end to a perfect vacation visiting our new grandson, daughter and son in law. Our server is Jacqueline. Oh my gosh what can I say but awesome! I had the chicken with apricots salsa a new  iteam on the menu. Jacqueline recommended the Kim Crawford white wine, a perfect compliment. When next thou visit you must ask for Jacqueline!!! Need more than 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and a bartender that doesn't know how to make martini!  Huge disappointment.   This  was one of my favorites.  Not anymore. Dirty bathroom with a broken sink fixture.  C'mon manager!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, all brewed on site! Definitely try the blue cheese topped ribeye or the lobster and shrimp tacos. Absolutely delicious! Perfect place for hanging out with friends after work! Has a great mellow vibe and gets busier as the night goes on!"}
{"text":"**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**  I first tried Gordon Biersch in San Diego and fell in love with the salmon caesar salad. Now I'm in Tempe and I have been to that location well over 10 times. I will go there for the salmon caesar, but will never stray from my usual order ever again. Unless it's just to pick up a quick order of garlic fries. Those are just yummy!  My friend who introduced me to the place has finally come up with what should be their slogan.... and after going through the latest experiences with them I might have to agree with her. \"Gordon Biersch. We'll just serve you what we want.\"  Let me explain based on my last dining excursion there. My last 3-4 have been about the same.  I arrive with my favorite carnivore who is also my best friend. We are seated promptly and receive our water with no wait. That's always good and they are good at doing this. She orders a burger as she has done for the last 3-4 times. She tells them she wants it medium. I told her she should have said rare because the last several times it came back well done. I strayed from my usual order of salmon caesar and ordered the crab cake sandwich. I asked her if she could substitute the lemon aioli for the tartar sauce, she said sure. I then asked if my garlic fries could be extra crispy and extra garlic and my friend said she didn't want hers that way. Waitress said no problem....  We get our orders. Burger? Well done again, not even close to medium. Fries for my friend? Extra crispy. Crab Sandwich? I had to ask her what the sauce was because it didn't look like the lemon aioli they serve with the appetizer and it didn't look like tartar sauce either. Her response? \"Oh that's our cajun sauce.\" WTH? No asking if I want it? Luckily, I was ok with it. My fries? I got my extra garlic, but they were a little soggy instead of extra crispy.  My friend and I were swapping fries.  We ordered dessert. Should have known better. They don't make their desserts there. That's apparent. The chocolate cake was really dry and their bread pudding was just disappointing (according to my friend). Thank heavens for the vanilla ice cream.... but I could pay much less at DQ.  I will continue to go there for the garlic fries because addicts need to get their fix too. I've learned not to stray from my usual order. Their salmon is never over salted, and always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The service I received recently at this location was the worst service ever!  I was in Scottsdale and was looking for somewhere to eat where I can take my dog.  Gordon Biersch had a deck so decided to stop in for drinks and food.  The server, Danny, came to our table and was very abrupt when taking our drink order.  He did nothing to make us feel welcomed to the restaurant.  Our drinks arrived in a timely fashion.  We finished looking through the menu and were ready to order food.  We waited and waited and waited, Danny, the server, walked past our table about 10 times.  He waited on every table around us brought them drinks and took their food orders but passed up our table every time.  We finished our drinks, he never returned to see about additional drinks or to take a food order.  We were in the restaurant a total of about an hour or so.  Danny obviously pre-judged our table as not worthy of service for some reason.  Because of this I will never visit this restaurant again.  I will also alert all of my friends and family of the terrible service at this location."}
{"text":"Sunday late lunch or early dinner , was very good , ordered fish sliders , chicken sliders and burger sliders . And 2 kids meal . The food was great , fresh and tasty. Loved the chicken BBQ sliders  ! Will come back again !"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and ate, the service was good. I would definitely come back her with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly food. The service is fast and nice people. Great beer but unfortunately not gluten free"}
{"text":"Delicious food, solid wine list (I don't drink beer; it was my husband's Bday), and great service. Get into it!"}
{"text":"My 16 year old chose here to eat for his Birthday dinner and it is his choice EVERY time he is given on. :-) The employees never treat the children as if they are not wanted. VERY much a family place as well as being a place that my hubby and I can go and have a night out alone.   The food is great and ALWAYS well flavored. I haven't had a bad meal yet. The beer makes my man happy as well!   We recommend and continue to take family and friends when they come into town.   The service staff is always welcoming and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"gordon's is our go to date night place. they have great food and happy hour. chicken tacos are awesome"}
{"text":"Today was our 2nd visit, and if it had been our first, we probably would not go back.  We really like the atmosphere and the ambiance.  The service was very good both times. The first visit was a nice surprise, and we were very pleased with our meals.  Today, not so much.  The New York strip steak was hardly pink at all and was dry.  A restaurant of that caliber should not have to rely on customers to send back their over cooked food.  The Stir-fry with shrimp was way over drenched with Teriaki sauce and the small shrimps were tough.  The house salad was very good and the mashed potatoes and chopped vegetables were good.  The crab artichoke dip with garlic toast was very tasty.  So it was not a total loss.  We had the $10 gift card given out on our 1st visit, but the waiter did not take it off because, \"we had to tell him it had $10 on it\".  So watch that if you go for a second visit.  Will we go back?...well, there is still the $10 credit...maybe."}
{"text":"Good food, great craft beer. I your looking for a place that has late night dining with and extensive menu, affordable prices and great quality this is the place."}
{"text":"I had the sirloin tips and mashed potatoes, it was ok, not too tough but nothing to say much about.  It seems kind of expensive for what I got.   They gave me a window seat overlooking the street.  It was interesting watching the evening crowd ebb and flow. I tried two beers.  The Marzen was tasty and I'd order another one.  The Rauchbier on the other hand just tasted kind of odd.  I would not get another of those."}
{"text":"Years ago, GB was pretty good. I definitely think 2.5 stars is what GB deserves now though. The only reason we come back is because people buy us gift cards or there is some deal, like yesterday's visit was 30% off. But everytime we leave going, \"eh.\" Their beers are decent but can be pricy.  I like their fish and chips but lordy no, as of yesterday they were $17 on the menu. They *used* to be $15 (cuz that $2 is a lot better lol). My husband ordered a caesar salad with chicken... and on the bill we saw it was $14. Whaaat? It wasn't even that big?? They charge FOUR extra dollars for the chicken. I got the California burger and fries for $3 less, granted my fry portioning was pretty skimpy.  A few visits ago I got a steak here and it was well done even though I ordered medium. It didn't taste very good either, and I remember the broccoli portioning was skimpy back then, too. Definitely not worth the money, especially when you have The Keg around the corner.  And then just to add insult to injury, my one Marzen beer was $5.75. SIX dollars for one beer?! That's the cost of a six pack of domestic at the grocery store, good grief.   $30 is becoming the new norm to spend on going out to lunch on the weekends and sometimes that is ok. But if I am being honest, GB's food and prices just aren't enough to encourage a return trip for me. I dislike spending money on mediocrity.   Oh and the bathroom always always reaks of sewage. Gross."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner tonight and the main dining area was very busy. They had one waiter taking care of 10 tables. Needless to say, he had no time for any of us. My steak arrived with a side of cold mashed potatoes and green beans. When I told the waiter, he didn't even stand around long enough, he just told the runner to bring another hot side of beans (I had to eat cold mashed potatoes). They brought another dish of green beans but replced it with my wife's side of green beans; he took her side plate away (she was still eating her order of green beans). I asked for my steak to be medium and it was still raw in the middle.  When the meal came to an end and we asked for dessert, the waiter said they did not have any coffee and we would have to wait 10 minutes. We passed on the dessert and asked for the bill. All in all, it was not a very pleasant experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30 pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait. Okay so we decide to wait it out. About 20 minutes later we were seated and our waitress came over rather quickly to take our drinks. We ordered our meals.  Southwestern egg rolls: Amazing! Cesar salad: Just blah  Rib eye steak: Bland lacked flavor, not worth $24 GB mushroom beer chicken: Was really good!!! Chicken was juicy! Creme brûlée dessert: Gross pudding  Service: Our service was ok, the girl was attentive and friendly. We paid about $78 and plus a $20 tip.   Why the one star? I know my group stayed about 10 minutes past the dining room hours but we were almost close to being done. (There were maybe two other tables still dining) As I'm looking over to our server and some other girl that was cleaning, (they are both vacuuming the booth next to mine) I hear the girl ask our server \"Is that table yours?\" Our server replies yes and rolls her eyes. Then the other girl still has more jokes up her sleeves and says loudly with an attitude, \"Well im just trying to get out of here on time tonight.\" And of course being immature little girls that they are, they whisper something to each other and laugh while looking at our table. REALLY?!?!?!?!? WTF!!!! Rude.  Girl go get your self a day time job if working at night does not fit your schedule! If your gonna talk about your customers do it in the back!!   Never coming back here."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have great food. So it's too bad I have to leave a poor review but their policy is ridiculous. If there is an event at one of the nearby stadiums, you have to pay to get in! Serious? Who charges money just to park and go in. They've lost customers in my family and friends. What a rip-off! I'm sure they \"think\" they have a good reason, but why would anyone pay that when you've got hundreds of other choices."}
{"text":"Delicious appetizer (minus the fact that it came out with 5 stale chips) drinks were ok, but the service was SO slow and my patio chair had bird poop on it. Will opt for something else next time"}
{"text":"Service always on point, beer amazing especially seasonals; and great food... summerbrau and blonde bock on point.. keep an eye out for the white IPA!!.. Happy Hour 3-6:30 daily and all day Saturday.."}
{"text":"One of thee best places in Las Vegas for happy hour!!!  If you want GREAT bar food and quality drinks for a an amazingly low price, then this is your place.   DRINKS: Unlike most happy hours the options on this menu long and ALL for $6.  I love the Grey Goose or Bombay Saffire traditional martini and the their version of a Collins Mojito.    HP APPETIZERS:  If I had to choose one thing to try it would be their crab dip!!! (order extra bread).  Their wings are actually legit. I love the sliders and they are actually like small gourmet burgers and not typical bar burgers. If you love fish tacos like I do, you need to order THESE!  HAPPY HOUR! HOORAY!  HAPPY HOUR! HOORAY!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! NEver great service, but who cares when your getting cheap ketel one vodka during happy hour! Keeps bringing me back. Bartender doesn't know how to make a margarita, so just stick to vodka. She put vodka instead of tequila."}
{"text":"An average experience. We came for the happy hour and there are some good options. The food was okay, nothing that blew me away. We were out on the patio/balcony area which gives a great view.  Our server was very attentive. The beers are of course great."}
{"text":"First beer tastes like a clove cigarette and then they didn't get the birthday cake out in time. The birthday boy had leave."}
{"text":"Man, I've been here like 3 times, and I have to say, I've not had anything short of eye popping. 1. They have Happy Hour 3-630. Um, yes please.  2. Chicken wings to die for! Amazing sauce! (And this from a chicken wing snob!) 3. Mushroom Risotto balls. Whoa. 4. Garlic Fries. So good! 5. French Dip Sliders. The boyfriend really liked them!  All in all, I totally like this place, and I've been to multiple locations. Becoming a favorite!!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour specials! Had the mushroom risotto balls! Amazing!!!! Fish tacos were awesome! Had the beef slider which was stupid good! Man, I thought this place was going to be a little uppity and just a one time stop, while shopping with a friend. I was pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday evening, me and a friend went here and sat at the bar. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to notice us and there was only three people at the bar. He finally came over to ask us what we wanted then he when back over to the other side and started talking to some girls and washing glasses. We order the beer sample which didn't require those types of glasses. After about another 15 mins (I was timing it) he kept talking to the girls by the wash area. We finally left and as we walked by he said \"oh sorry\""}
{"text":"The mahi mahi fish tacos are delicious.  Great service and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Ordered the classic chopped salad.  Salad was decently portioned, but the chicken seemed over cooked and the salad lacked flavor in general."}
{"text":"A coworker and I were looking for a nice place to enjoy happy hour to celebrate an occasion. I love GB for happy hour, as they have it 7 days per week. They have a great selection of beer, wine, and appetizers 2.99-5.99!   The bar area is comfortable and fun. It was rather busy and loud tonight because of the NFL draft going on. The bar has four large TV screens and a large wooden bar. There are also high top tables with benches also available for larger parties.   The food menu for happy hour includes sliders, garlic fries, sushi, flatbread, pizza, and wings. A little bit of everything for anyone.   Our waitress was friendly and timely for how busy she was . Our drinks were always full. She came to check on us numerous times.  The food and drinks were amazing. I enjoyed this much needed relaxation and indulgence !"}
{"text":"The rating is solely based on experience with the General Manager - Mike Wong. I believe that if you are going to be a manager, lead by example. I believe that he should learn from his staff, because they  know how to handle the pressure of  a busy night. My partner, my dad and his wife decide to go to the Gordon Biersch this evening. We were advised by the hostess that we would have a wait of 15-20 minutes and that is what we waited. The bartender William was awesome very attentive as well as our server Cameo. She is great with the customers.   There were a few staff members that were stumbling over the mats at the service window. Since our booth was right in front of the service station, I made a comment to the General Manager. All he did was put the other mat over the other mat. So now the staff was stumbling over the mat going the other way.. DAH.. you think that he might have done something else to rectify the problem.   He lacks customer service..He never came back to say thank you for noticing the problem, however his staff did.   But that is OK . I wouldn't really expect it from him anyway...it  looks like he doesn't like his job, doesn't smile,, doesn't have any contact with his customers, very little communication with his staff either.. . From the short time that I was there he does a good job of barking order to his staff in front of his guest."}
{"text":"Went here for Reverse happy Hour and had mostly positive results. Late night HH starts at 9pm and this place closes at 11:30pm. We ordered a $5 BBQ chicken pizza and garlic fries. The fries had to be returned because there was hardly any garlic on them. Previous visits around the country usually had too much garlic, so this was strange. The second version was better, but the garlic needed to be cooked, not thrown in raw. Pizza was decent, but undercooked.       The outdoor patio was the best part as we had the fake Fireplace area to ourselves after 10pm. Kelsey was also very nice as our waitress. The new beer that they featured also was tasty - something with an M in the name. Join the passport club and get $10 credit for next visit.      My date was Jolly from YELP - my first yelp pickup. Another woman who took a free meal and disappeared."}
{"text":"I actually went to this location twice during my trip to Vegas. The food selection is good and the beers are a step up from the normal selection that is available in these brew pub locations.   I have been to a couple of other GB locations around the country and this one as with the others is a solid choice for either lunch or dinner.  Straightforward unpretentious food with good beer and good service."}
{"text":"It's a very convenient 5 minute walk away from my home. I saved about $10 in uber fees. They have an all day happy hour every Sunday. The prices overall were a little bit more than other local places. It's a great place to watch sports. There are a lot of televisions that can be watched straight from the bar or at nearby tables.  The cocktails were okay. The food was average. It's was tasty but nothing special. Nothing to write home about.  Overall, just okay."}
{"text":"Nice place. Beer is cold and delicious. The wait staff is friendly and attentive and the appetizers are solid."}
{"text":"Food was very good!  I & my hubby shared  the BBQ Chicken pizza along with the Chopped Chicken salad. Was delish! The craft beer was great too!  Was a very busy Friday nite, but servers brought out food in a timely manner.  Very happy with our choice of restaurant!"}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing food I have ever had, only complemented by the incredible service with her insight and recommendations of our fantastic server Joanne. Also the chef that prepared our food, Executive chef Jeff with his incredible preparation of his food and knowledge of flavor parings, when we asked to speak with him he was incredibly humble and jubilant to receive such praise for his outstanding execution of culinary cuisine, which we will  recommend this amazing food and outstanding service to anyone. I will definitely be going to this place many many times, regardless of our two hour drive from Tucson.."}
{"text":"Get the flight to find out what beer you like, there was 9 different brews on my flight. Apps are good especially Bavarian pretzel and warm crab dip. If you're in town, give it a try!"}
{"text":"We are regulars and came back for return visit on Jan 13, for happy hour and appetizers as our last experience was 5 stars. This visit - not so much. Receipt says table 73/1, Server: Sydney.  Check # 10042. Party of 6 ordering cocktails and about every appetizer on the menu. We ordered 4 martinis and when served they were all different volumes from full to barely 2/3rds of SMALL glasses. We hate to nitpick about this but there was quite a difference. When we brought to our servers attention, she said that is just they way the bartender pours them. What kind of lame answer is that? 2 of us get less drink? So she brought out a single martini for the 2 of us that was shorted so we thought that was a nice gesture. But when when the bill came - she freaking charged us!! All the food was very good but our servers performance and attitude went down from there. Asked for water twice, never received. Since we ordered so many appetizers, we stacked up quite a few dishes. Did she or anyone else offer to clear the table? No. We started stacking on the vacant table next to us while the server was at our table, she just watched. She brought our bill before any plates were cleared, a major error for a server and did not ask about another round or desert. After spending a couple hundred dollars, we went across the street to another place for desert. We tipped accordingly - $1 per couple and wrote an appropriate note on our receipt. Sorry Sydney, learn how to do your job and you will earn a proper tip. Its a shame to to visit one of our favorite places, enjoy the good food and a server runs it with attitude."}
{"text":"Parking for carryout , but NO HANDICAPPED PARKING! Was in the area and decided to stop for lunch. Place was empty. Service was great, food ok. Only thing special was the fries. Shrimp salad was missing a lot of shrimp. Biggest complaint was the lack of handicap parking. They do have two slots right in front for carry out, but the only handicapped slots were two stores down at the end of the complex. Wonder if they ignore the American Disabilities Act, what other laws/regulations are ignored by this firm. These spots were not mis-marked as mentioned in local media - they did not exist. Guess GB does not want older handicapped folks in their establishment. Based on this and the overpriced food, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the some Sundays the ppl and food is great you have to come and eat here try the food and the music is great"}
{"text":"a brewery that sells \"super pretzels\" right out of the freezer case?  What a joke.  Never again at any of their locations."}
{"text":"The bad: the food is just average.  The good: the beer is relatively inexpensive.  The great: the service is outstanding.   I sat in the bar tonight and the servers were both going out of their way to go the extra mile. Not just service with a smile, but fast, generous, GOOD service (with a smile)."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get some okay, not so healthy food, some beer and watch the Patriot's continue their winning streak."}
{"text":"This place went downhill quickly. We used to frequent here pretty regularly. After coming tonight to take advantage of their promotional birthday dinner for my wife she was promptly asked by a rude bartender to PROVE her birth date. Instead of a happy birthday. Our food took almost an hour. Showed up half hot half cold. Pretty similar to the shoulder we got by service. Huge thumbs down."}
{"text":"Would not recommend eating there. The menu is small and my husband ordered a 21 ounce beer and received a 1/2 liter which is 16 ounces. We were ready to order our food and he walked by us 3 times ignoring us. When I told the waiter it was the wrong size he said they go by another measuring system but was still charged the 21 ounce for 16 ounces.  This was a very disappointing experience. They need to be better informed"}
{"text":"The customer service shown by Elijah was excellent He was the only there serving up to 20 tables and we never had to wait was extremely nice and cut his break short to serve us great customer appreciation skills just all around amazing definitely returning"}
{"text":"Excellent food and spirits. We came in here for some brews and munchies last weekend after the Q2 drag races at LV Motor Speedway  The IPA was great, nice hops and perfect after taste. I had the steak frites, perfectly cooked, the other  hot rodder  guys had salmon, meat loaf and steaks, no one was talking so it had to be great. We come in here every LV trip, and are never disappointed.  Great list of cold  brews and these folks know how to cook."}
{"text":"Had the Cajun Pasta this time around, and it was awesome.  Didn't personally try the micro brews but my buddies who had them seemed to like them a lot.  The lobster mac and cheese seemed to be a good option as well.  Get the garlic fries."}
{"text":"3.5* I wasn't expecting much from Gordon Biersch, I've tried a number of their beers at the grocery stores and all were too hop bitter for my tastes.  I got some gift cards from my work so I decided to check 'em out-Lord knows I worked for it :) I went in after playing a round of golf so we sat in the bar to avoid offending other diners.  Service was pretty slow considering how empty the place was.  The food exceeded my expectations, could be I was ravenous from spending the last four hours hacking a golf ball in the desert. I'd come back while I have these gift cards, I thought for happy hour it was a little pricy.  Food and beer were pretty good, try the Kolsch!"}
{"text":"Worst service again, sit here for 15 minutes at least and they act like we were invisible.... Finally ordered a beer and it set at the bar for another 5 minutes... Will never return."}
{"text":"I don't wanna talk bad about this place, because it IS better than Chili's and Applebee's. It's definitely a step up from them, but I wish I could rave more. I wish I was more of a beer person to enjoy the brewery side to this restaurant but hubby is and he says that their beer is just ok..   My fav to get is the Kobe Burger (8 oz. American-style Kobe beef burger is grilled with cheddar cheese with garlic fries). Very freshly made! Their handmade root beer is so good, it tastes like the old-time A&W root beer, something special about it. It's difficult to get the bartender's attention no matter what time we go though. Borders between a 3 to a 4, but I'll bump it up because I'm feeling generous today."}
{"text":"My wife says I've eaten here before so I obviously don't remember it being that great but today's nomnomnom there was nomnomdelicious.   Ate their calamari, chicken bacon lettuce Tomato, garlic fries and it was fantabulouso!  Hmmmm nom nom."}
{"text":"Ok truth is this really a restaurant that doubles for a place that makes beer.  Beer is not that great...Come here because I am loyal to Craft Works brands. Our bartender Chris is fantastic... He us funny energetic and works his tail off behind the bar . Makes it work coming here.... Be sure to Ask for him as he is a server as well"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this weekend and I was very pleased with my overall experience. I had Vegan taco's with black beans substituted for garlic fries and a delicious hot tea called \"Hint of Mint.\"  For all you tea lovers out there they have a pretty good selection of tea's and quite a few are decaf. We were seated right away in a nice booth and our waiter was very nice and clean cut. The food came out quickly and was delicious for both me and my brother. He had a chicken cooked three different ways dish, sorry the name escapes me. My big bro also had a German beer called Hefeweizen I did try a sip and as a non-drinker I found it delicious and very balanced.   The only reason it won't get five stars from me is the price tag of my meal. I had two taco's, cup of black beans, and a single glass of tea. My total at the end of the meal? $19.00 not including tip. This was not a split my brother and I went Dutch for this meal and I found that to be pretty pricey considering what I ordered. Don't me wrong I'm not a miser or anything I just think for one person $25 (tip included) for lunch is hefty! Right? Come on everybody!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch got that same feel as BJ's Brewery, Yardhouse.. Can't really go wrong with places like this.   Never went wrong with this:  Gordon Biersch Cheeseburger and Garlic Fries: The 3/4 inch thick (10oz., USDA Choice Beef) Patty matched the diameter of buns with the perfect checker board grill marks and char, melted american cheese (doesn't quite stretch as wide as the patty), crisp veggies and toasted buns.. This my friends was a simple but perfectly satisfying all american burger! The Garlic Fries another hit! Nice balance of Garlic and some crunch from the fries, so good!   Real Chill Ambiance, Great value, Many Many different Food Items ranging from Artichoke dip to Cajun fish tacos, a Fully stocked bar.. Service better than average. A great place for a casual date or a group of alcoholics!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for a dinner presentation. Slowest service I've ever encountered for such an event (and I've been to many). Salads arrived about 45 minutes after the program started, and it was almost two hours before the first dinner plate hit the table. When I contacted the manager this was explained away by saying that the presenter requested a 20-minute lag between ordering and preparation (there is a bit of a difference between 20 minutes and almost two hours). Went to another presentation about a week later at another place and we were done with everything (including dessert) in 15 minutes less than it took GB to just bring us our entrees. I can't say how good the food was, because I had to choke mine down in order to get home by 10 PM (from a presentation that began at 6:30). Color me unimpressed."}
{"text":"Nothing beats dining al fresco in the Phoenix version of summertime. Snagged a seat outside here with cousin and had a few enjoyable meals. His meditterean Chicken appeared healthy as it came off the Heart healthy menu. Enough healthy stuff, my order was stuffed chicken and this was prepared way different than normal, which is usually spinach and cheese inside. In this version, it was goat cheese mostly with some cheddar and sun dried tomatoes. The chicken breast was sliced into four pieces and it was kind of served open face. It looked small, but was filling at 15 bucks (see photo). I switched out the Kale concoction for Garlic mashed potatoes (the garlic fries appetizer was way better) and there was some average veggies on the plate. Perhaps the best item on that plate was the roasted garlic peanut dipping sauce. Truly legendary on that item. Beer here has kind of not changed in many moons - same stuff for years, so maybe a new flavor or two will get that fifth star.  Sunsets are awesome too from here. Orange explosion."}
{"text":"Great service from Kari at the bar. She went out of her way to make sure that we were taking care of. Friendly and outgoing. Go sit at the bar and ask for Kari, fast food and friendly service. High five."}
{"text":"JUST don't get steak of any kind here. The kind waitress warned me against it in her tactful way but I went against her advice and ordered the ribeye with Gorgonzola anyway which was one of the \"chefs favorites\" and it was awful. But no complaints because they comped it and I didn't even ask them to do that. Everyone else was happy with whatever they ordered so hence the three stars instead of two. But five stars for service because the waitress was excellent."}
{"text":"Id sacrifice waist line and all to eat burgers here everyday lol. From their Cajun chicken pasta, to their Cali burger with garlic fries. I'm glad my partners at La Quinta introduced me to GB. Great service and chill vibes always from the staff. Call in your order if needed, you just cant go wrong with too much here."}
{"text":"Yes, Gordon Biersch is a chain but it's still good comfort food for beer lovers. Their selection of brews are awesome, and if you choose a favorite type (Lager, Stout, Amber) you're guaranteed to be drinking something you'll like. The food is absolutely delicious. My favorite for many years now has been the Blackened Mahi Mahi Sandwich, with a nice hearty piece of Mahi on a toasted bun, arugula lettuce if I'm not mistaken, and an awesome mayo spread. Appetizers are fantastic too, and we had the homemade potato chips with a bunch of toppings, such as bleu cheese, bacon, bleu cheese dressing, and scallions. The service at this location is great as well. We were seated within two minutes (for a party of 8) and both the server and the manager came by and took time to chat with us while we were making selections on the menu. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's mom gave us a gift card last night to go eat here, so we did. Neither of us had been before, so we weren't entirely sure what to expect.   The restaurant itself is clean and modern. Hostess was friendly, as was our waitress.   There are many options, which is a bonus anywhere you go. My boyfriend ordered a 12 oz steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and rice pilaf for $23.99. I ordered the Artisan grilled cheese with their signature garlic fries for $9.50. I thought it would be fairly small for the price but was SHOCKED when the waitress brought it out. Not only was the sandwich a good portion, but it was also delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well, and the sides were both a good amount.  My only complaints were that the waitress didn't ask us if we wanted refills until we were done eating. Also, the garlic fries are EXTREMELY garlicky and had excess oil. I love garlic a lot, but it was a bit much for me. If you're not a huge fan or if you're not used to garlic, don't order the garlic fries.   We don't drink alcohol, so we can't speak for that, but everything else was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was here on a business meeting meeting today for lunch.  Our server messed up two out of three orders.  They still couldn't fix it.  By the time they brought an alternate choice out, it was time to go.  Terrible food, terrible service.  It's Final Four week, and this place bombed!  It's two minutes away from where the games will be played, and they weren't even busy! What does that tell you? GROSS"}
{"text":"Love the patio.  You have to go during happy hour for a good deal.  Happy hour starts at 3:30 but if you call they will say 4.  If you ask they will say 4 but in print everything says 3:30.  I love the Winterbock beer.  Still not over what an a hole the manager was on New Years Eve.  Anyway trying to let that go :-)"}
{"text":"Was at the mall and had an appointment so I decided to head here and have a beer while I waited.  It's a typical Gordon Biersch, but they have an indoor/outdoor bar that I noticed was popular in this area that's super nice. They also have another patio on the other side, so essentially a wrap-around seating area. Very cool.  Walked up to the bar, was greeted by a girl that didn't really impress. No smile, or welcome, just basically 'what can I get you?' That's fine, but I ordered then looked around for my beer, it had been a few minutes, and this chick is making other drinks. Not cool. I look at her she sees me and THEN gets my beer.   So, it's really your standard GB. Nothing special. The food is okay (I've eaten at others), I like their beer, but wish they'd be more friendly and get that whole order (it's in the name - ex. in order) thing down. First come, first serve, no?  There are better bars, find them."}
{"text":"Totally not a fan of Gordon Biersch anymore.  I feel like their food has changed completely.  I now feel ill when I leave this place.  Sad."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this restaurant a review but sadly I cannot. My boyfriend asked where the outside patio was but sadly they decided that by asking where the patio was the management said our whole parry was too drunk to be served? So we promptly left. Such a shame,  we had heard good things about this place."}
{"text":"We weren't sure what we wanted for dinner and decided to try this place since we've been to the happy hour at the Old Town Pasadena location with friends before.  We were seated promptly and ordered ourselves some soft drinks.  The waitress was nice and ready to serve us even though it was around 8pm already.  I had the house specialty, steak frites, and my fiance had the buffalo burger, which was the burger special of the week.  Honestly, my steak frites was not worth the $19.  The whole plate was pretty much all garlic fries and few strips of beef on top.  My fiance's burger was a little too gamey and couldn't finish it all.    *Location = nice.  just a few steps from the shops. *Food = wasn't worth the money but maybe other dishes are better? *Ambiance = very relaxing *Service = good"}
{"text":"We came to this location shortly after it opened and it was a solid \"meh\" for me so I haven't been back until this past weekend.  I have to say - it has turned around!  The menu was interesting and varied.  The chopped salad is divine and is a fantastic option if you're looking for something a bit lighter.  My husband raved about his burger.  They have a wonderful list of cocktails which is always refreshing to see (I'm not so much a beer-o-phile so I appreciate the options)."}
{"text":"My previous visits were colored with lacking luster service. This time, our server, Stephanie was fabulous. She was attentive and treated us like royalty.  When we arrived, we were pleased that even though it was a game night, they had plenty of seating to accommodate us on a Saturday night. Even though we could've taken advantage of the Happy Hour deals at the bar, we chose to celebrate our anniversary meal in the comfort and quiet of a booth in the dining section.   Tip: On game nights, Gordon Biersch does not take reservations. However, we were seated immediately.  Tip: Sign up for Gordon Biersch emails. They have fabulous email coupons and deals. We had a buy one entree get one free that we used that night.  We wanted a beer. Hubby prefers a Pilsner. We asked for the list of GB craft beers. She brought us samples of the Blitzen, Marzen and the Golden Export. Hubby liked the Golden Export best. It was a light, clean and crisp brew. The Blitzen was pretty good. We both found the Marzen a little too hoppy and bitter. Stephanie heard that I liked darker brews and was deferring to hubby so she brought several darker samples as well: Schwartzbier (dark and robust) and the Hefweizen.  Stephanie was kind enough to split our full pour into 2 glasses.  For dinner, hubby and I enjoyed the ribeye steak. I had mine with the gorgonzola butter, garlic fries and crimini mushroom spatzle. I love the garlic fries. It is really crisp and garlicky. I loved how tender my steak was, but I wasn't a fan of the gorgonzola butter. A great steak should not be overpowered by anything. The crimini mushroom spatzle was yummy at first, but got cold super fast.  Hubby had a perfect medium rare steak without any butter. Stephanie was kind enough to fulfill our request for having sauces on the side: au jus, red wine reduction and she even brought out a garlic-gorgonzola sauce. The au jus and reductions were to die for. I enjoyed it so much with each bite of steak. The garlic-gorgonzola wasn't as nice with the steak, but I enjoyed livening up the spatzle. Hubby had garlic mash with the meal and a side salad which he didn't really care for. The salad was unremarkable. We tried the jalapeno ranch which had a little more flavor than the regular ranch.   The shocker of the evening was the garlic mashed potatoes which came out cold. We told Stephanie, and she remedied it immediately. I told you our server was fabulous!  We ended the evening taking home a Growler of Golden PIlsner as a gift for our neighbor.  Tip: Old Black Friday, GB had an amazing deal of $50 for 1 year's fill for Growlers. That's a refill of a Growler per week. What  a deal! Bad for the waistline but great for the soul!"}
{"text":"I would not give this restaurant any stars but our waitress was friendly nice and prompt.  Called for a reservations lady said they weren't busy and didn't need one so I said we will see you at 5:30.  Got there and waited 20 minutes to be seated.  Hostess wasn't friendly.  She was overwhelmed with seating and getting tables ready.  Entry way was full of people and no hostess for 5-10 minutes.  Our waiter was friendly took our order right away as we were on our way to the hockey game.  Waited a hour,  still no food.   Even prepaid our bill so we could exit quickly.  Ended up getting billed credit back to us because still no food after a hour and 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great service from the team, very friendly and great food. I would definitely recommend the California burger or the beer battered fish and chips. Only problem with this place is parking but doesn't affect me eating great food at all."}
{"text":"Great patio!  Their patio I will have to say is amazing.  I ordered the italian cheese pizza.  Looked and tasted like a digiorno out of the box, actually digiorno is better.  And I hate digiorno."}
{"text":"This is our go to late night dinner. I've tried almost every pasta platter and fish platter.  They have a great mojito. My boys love their burgers. The garlic fries are soooooo good. The service is good and if you are here on a nice cool night eat in the patio area."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  I mean, the food was just \"eh\" my sandwich fell apart.  Going to a Beer place, I expect lots of potions for Beer, and well they only have 5-6 beers to pick from.  Meh."}
{"text":"Been waiting almost an hour and a half for food. I don't care if the food is good or not. The wait time is unacceptable. I would imagine that the majority of people here are trying to make the 8pm Amy Schumer show. I'm not sure if that's going to happen or not."}
{"text":"Walked in, table was dirty, had to request it be wiped down.  Men's bathroom filthy. Walked out."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least...The food and service are actually \"so-so\".  The beer is pretty good and the selection is sufficient.  Also, the place is rather upscale and clean so those are pluses as well.  The problem I have with GB is that the location, layout, and the fact that it's a brewery with a full kitchen suggest that it should be much MUCH better.  That is why I rate it as a 3-star place."}
{"text":"Yes ,it is a chain. Yes, it is one of the better chains. Yes ,the food is good. Yes, the ambience is good. Yes, it is clean. Wife and I went for lunch today. Everything was good / better then run of the mill. Fresh, appealing, two tiers above the run of the mill chain. Upper middle / lower upper class clientele. Comfortable place. 60 bucks for lunch for 2...so as I said upper middle / lower upper place. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner and drinks. The service was great, food was great. Their beer is not for me. I had the summer seasonal which tasted like a watered down bud-light and bud-light already has a watered down taste to begin with. The next one I had was there Amber, which was just not very good."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed as we went on Saturday night and seemed overpriced for the dishes and beers were just ok.   I'll choose The Yardhouse or dine local establishments over GB going forward."}
{"text":"I've been in twice for lunch within the last 6 weeks. Pecan crusted salmon is very good here. Wait staff is ok. Nothing remarkable to note either way. Food was good and I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"They have lost the touch. Food quality has decliner over the years. Customer service is not very enthusiastic either. They need to bring more energetic people and make food from scratch not just the frozen kind from Sysco"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday late afternoon and it wasn't really busy. Service was pretty good. This was my first time at one of these restaurants and it was basically average. Food wasn't bad, but wasn't anything too great to brag about. Pretzel was way too salty and the nachos were a weird texture. None of it was bad, but not great either. Beer was ok"}
{"text":"Went there with the hubby on valentines day  and having no kids  with us I wanted to have a nice evening  with some good food. We'll we  ended up so disappointed my husband ordered the ribeye myself the Kobe burger both came out raw .. And when I saw raw I mean practically mooing it was so disgusting .after waiting an hour for our food to be made again I was still sadly disappointed burger was dry ,steak was ordered medium rare and was well and chewy needless to say it was not the romantic dinner I had hoped for. However I will say that the manager was great and handled it amazingly he took care of  our entire dinner and apologized profusely which thanks to him I will definitely be back in hopes for a better experience"}
{"text":"I took my parents to Gordon Biersch for dinner while they were in town.  the 4 stars is largely based on the service we received, it was prompt, courteous, and genuine.   My mother was interested in the Lobster Bisque but even a cup was too large a portion, so we didn't order it.  He later surprised her with a small ramekin of the soup.  It was very thoughtful and she was impressed by that.  We enjoyed the food and the overall experience."}
{"text":"Dinner with the fam. Tonight I decided to try the housemade tacos with lobster & shrimp. It's my fave new dish. Both blue corn & flour tortillas with chipotle dressing. The marzen  beer was a perfect compliment."}
{"text":"Their house beer is fairly good and their happy hour specials are excellent! I cannot speak to their full menu as I typically only go for happy hour but pretty much all drinks and a large food menu are included in happy hour. Definitely recommend as an after work drink meet up spot."}
{"text":"I was on a conference when visiting the area and tired of what Westgate had to offer, then I stumbled on this place.   I came in with a party of eight. The nearby Yard House had very slow service, I was delighted when the wait staff promptly assisted us. When there was a delay, we got an apology and the delayed item was on the house.... now that's service. I wish I could say the same based on our Yard House experiences.   Overall the food was good but nothing outstanding. The location was hip and pleasant but nothing to write home about. It was overall a positive experience, I gave one extra star because of the great customer service experience, I really was impressed by the initiative they took to keep us happy, they didn't even wait for a complaint or a frowny face, they just remedied a situation that they knew wasn't acceptable... good for them."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars because it's a really cool vibe, good food, drinks and service. I little pricey so it won't be a regular place for us to go to. We enjoyed happy hour and the beef sliders were awesome. So was the tuna."}
{"text":"So very disappointed in my most recent visit to this place. I have been to a few locations in Southern California over the last few years and the San Tan location is by far the worst.   Came in just after 9pm with my family and stood in the front for at least 5 minutes where a host or hostess should be but was never assisted. Finally flagged down a server and he suggested we sit at the bar area for the happy hour specials. We find the only empty table there and it was wet and dirty. It was about another 5 minutes before we were greeted so i grabbed a napkin from another table and cleaned it off myself.   Waiter finally shows to take the drink order gets that wrong. We place our food order which was the chicken schnitzel ( Was not tenderized at all more like breaded chicken breast) it was left under a warmer too long which  was accompanied by bland spatzel. We also received some very rubbery and overly salted calamari. The kids meals were ok and nothing special.   The place is definitely lacking good management and staff training.   I would highly suggest any one of the other restaurants in the surrounding area before wasting your time and money here."}
{"text":"Tried happy hour here with my boyfriend. The appetizers and beer were great!  We'll have to come back and try their full menu sometime."}
{"text":"Bummed that this place sucked so bad! How can you mess up tacos? 13.99 for tacos is hard enough but when they are dry and flavorless it's even worse. Great location for people viewing and we can see the tail end of the Christmas parade from our table but our waitress was new and slow, food was sub par and bathrooms were dirty with no toilet paper or paper towels. I don't think I will ever return!"}
{"text":"The service as good considering the U2 pre-concert crowd.  We were offered samples of newly tapped beers.  The food was better than expected.  My only complaint was the state of the ladies room.  There was no toilet paper, the trash can with paper towels was overflowing, and paper towels, soap scum and water littered the sink area."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with the boyfriend and all I can say is we were very disappointed we were expecting good food and beers and left with unhappy stomachs. From the service to the burgers we had, all I can say is we were better off getting a burger at a drive through. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"Service was okay, had to call my server over a few times and it was pretty empty at the time I went at. Had the Märzen BBQ burger and it was delicious. Not too much sauce and well cooked. Sweet potato fries and garlic fries were nice side dishes. Tough to park nearby because it's on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with the service at Gordon Biersch. Our waiter was friendly and very accommodating with our group. The food is good, the place is located on the outskirts of a busy area, it's nice not to have to walk through crowds to get to it."}
{"text":"Today was my first time there with 2 of my coworkers. First of all, the two hosts at the entrance weren't really nice. They kept talking together and when they finally realized we walked in, they looked kind of pissed they had to interrupt their conversation to take care of us. I love the industrial look of this place. And the fact they're brewing their own beers. Our server was friendly but not really paying attention. He messed up with our order and one out of our three orders came wrong. Then my portion of sweet potato fries came out way smaller than the others. When I told him that, he said he would bring some more as he also noticed it. Never made it to the table though. The food is very good and served in a good size (except for my fries...). Very tasty. When it came for us to leave, same thing, the two hosts didn't even care about responding to our goodbyes...  I will definitely go back someday when I have more time. Meanwhile I strongly suggest they improve on their staff."}
{"text":"I am no longer going to eat or drink at this restaurant.  Second game day I try to go eat and drink prior to the ASU game and they are closed for a visiting team.   I used to frequent here on other occasions, but no more."}
{"text":"Arriving here at Gordon Biersch, there was no wait. They seated us right away which was awesome in my opinion. The server came over less than 5 minutes asking for drink orders(plus in my book). Once we finally figured out what to order the food came out less than 20 minutes! Mind you me and my boyfriend were hungry so that was perfect timing. Everything was great up until I noticed the manager I suppose go around to every table to make sure everyone was being taken cared of. We sat far out in the opening so missing our table was impossible. She skipped our table and did not acknowledge us. Maybe because we look like kids? I am not sure, it would be hard to go with the fact that she just did not see us because we are far out in the opening. I hope that doesn't boil down to picking and choosing who you'd like to check on and who you do not want to just go over and speak with. Every little thing counts with me and I just thought that wasn't nice of her. Other than that the food was amazing :)."}
{"text":"The beer Sampler is a must and the appetizers are really good. This place has a great environment. Perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date."}
{"text":"Good food, craft beer, and good service. The southwest egg rolls are a must and the fish tacos are better than most Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a Chilli's restaurant and the giant TV's with sports on are really getting old. I just like to eat without distractions. The food was just plain, and the beer was good but not great. I take that back, the Czech Pilsner was great. The server was really good too. I probably won't go back but it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"Been to both GBs in Vegas but this one has a great neighborhood feel. My dad is a regular and I show my face a few times a month. Most the food is great, I order something different everything and haven't been disappointed yet, even with foods I feel iffy about ordering. Better maibach than the Hofbrauhaus near the strip GB, and a higher alc content too, 8 vs 7.   Plenty of TVs around the bar and dining tables in the back, as well as large party rooms in the back which I have been in for a work xmas party. GB also worked for Mothers Day brunch, dinner with the girlfriend, and of course watching sports at the bar enjoying GB BEER!  Nice staff always friendly, usually get greeted by a manager or two. See bartenders around town off work sometimes too.  Warm decor nothing loud or clashy, comfortable and sometimes dimly lite and intimate towards the back.  0 complaints I always feel like there's a spot for me!  What stands out Garlic Fries, Seasonal beers, Staff, Long Happy Hours (also they have a nice club card with member rewards)"}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon drink and bite to eat. Outdoor balcony patio overlooks Mill Street, plus they have misters that keep the air cool.  Legendary Garlic Fries. They will Blow You Away!! After eating these fries you'll never want normal french fries ever again...EVER!!!   Blue Crab and Artichoke Dip: Do It! Do It! Do It!! You won't regret it. Awesome. Amazing. Wow!  Gordon Biersch Hefeweizen: Goes down soooooo SMOOTH! I don't normally like Hef but I definitely Dig this one."}
{"text":"Everything is like average. Like another person reviewed, I also fell in love with the Sandiego branch. Compared to that place, something missed. However, it is located in the very good place in Tempe.  Good place to enjoy sports and beer itself. Good place to have a group gathering. and I like their outside seats. :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday afternoon around happy hour although I did not have any alcohol. I've always wanted to try this place and I pass it all the time in my travels. Located in the really nice Howard Hughes area near Paradise and Flamingo.   When it comes to burgers, I don't get them fancy. I will not be able to comment on the sauces or specialty toppings but I can tell you about the beer and bread for sure!  In this case, both were very tasty. I had it topped with thick applewood smoked bacon and onions. I just dipped in a little ketchup.   I'd heard about the garlic fries and knew I wanted to taste them. They were exceptional. My mouth is watering just writing about them right now. (I will advise you not to have these if you're on a date or headed to one in the following 48 hours because they're very garlicky).   I can't comment on prices because I got lucky and my boss paid.   This was my first visit but will not be my last. Give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"Is a beer connoisseur, this is one my favorite places!! Great  great !!! Close to home !! Gotta  it!"}
{"text":"I love this Gordon Biersch location! So close to home that I can walk back if I get a little too tipsy. They have yummy food and awesome beers! They even have half price wine bottles for happy hour! The atmosphere at the bar and the outside patio are amazing - so laid back. I have had a bunch of good times here and will continue to keep going back. All my servers thus far have been great too. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Sliders and baby brats were extremely tasty.     Marzen is a household beer and It sits right next to its partner in crime blonde bock."}
{"text":"While the food is very good, the service leaves something to be desired. We waited around 15 minutes before we even saw a server who informed us our server would be out soon. Our real server never came, and we waited 15 more minutes for someone to take our order. It took around 20-25 minutes for our food to come out (veggie burger and Kobe burger) which I feel is an unusually long amount of time for such simple stuff. Naturally, we had to wait a while for our check and then again for our change. My water never got refilled which left me both thirsty and a bit cranky.  The food was good but not good enough that I would return to such poor service."}
{"text":"Had a great burger and drinks..... Ordered an ahi salad to go ... Didn't check my salad until I got home. Was literally 2 cups of lettuce and 2oz of tuna for $15!! Giving them a great review because I immediately called the manager and she kindly reimbursed my salad purchase. Service like this does not go unnoticed! I'll be back!  Well done Gordon Biersch!"}
{"text":"Two strikes for Gordon Biersch in the SanTan Mall. This is the second time attempting to have dinner here & two times NO service!  The first time was a weekend, after waiting 30 min we were seated & for the next 15 min no one came to the table for drinks or anything, so we left. Tonight, we figured it's the middle of the week & there wasn't a wait, so we went in & not even a greeter this time!  We waited for 5 min & still no one so we left.  I guess this means they don't need our business, sooooo we probably won't be going back again!  Both times we walked down to Famous Dave's BBQ where we were immediately greeted, taken to a table & in less than 2 min our server was there asking what kind of beverage we wanted."}
{"text":"It was great food! We went after 9pm so they were only serving pizza and wings but the pizza was amazing! A perfect amount of sauce. We had buffalo wings and they were good. You could taste they were buffalo but weren't overwhelmingly hot. Definitely will go back before 9 next time!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch, sat at the bar, was carded for my club soda and felt like I was invisible because I wasn't ordering proper drinks with my food. It was ok bar food at great happy hour price. Nothing really to race about though."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service. Waitress a extremely rude. Empty bar, had to wait 15min for are drinks. If your only going to serve your own Brew, Staff should be knowledgeable and be able to recommend brews. I'm just one Customer who won't be coming back.  Bye Felicia"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and a great beer selection, but the bartender (girl with long brown hair in ponytail, Sara I think) was downright rude and acted as if I was wasting her time by asking for a beer or mushroom bites at the bar. This was enough for me to not come back. She was rude and had a scowl the entire 1.5 hours I was here. All else was good, but my bartender ruined it. Find someone with a smile and more customer service experience. -a customer and fellow bartender."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus star I would. We originally were a party of 12 that shrunk to 9. Our server was obviously overwhelmed. When appetizers were delivered the empty drink glasses were not removed. Then when dinner was delivered the appetizer plates were still in place and the server tried to put our plates of food onto the empty appetizer plates. I have never had empty plates with shells left on the table the entire meal much less having to beg to get water glasses refilled.  I could go on but why....I will end with this TJ the manager on duty had better go back to customer service class. He was rude, condescending and generally a jerk.  I will never go back.  Good luck to anyone who goes on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Little late with the review. I was there September 20 in the afternoon. My father and I came in for a beer and an appetizer. The waiter we had was great. Very attentive, and helpful. I wish I could remember his name! I had one of there light beers from the tap. We had the calamari as our appetizer and it was fabulous. We had the full serving it it was just enough for the both of us. We were also greeted by the manager due to it being my first time there. I did forget his name though. He gave us a free brownie gift card to come back in. Great experience"}
{"text":"Oh Biersch, how I love you! This is one of my favorite places to go for Happy Hour. I love their atmosphere -  it is upbeat, classy and fun. It's never too loud, even if its packed. To be perfectly honest though... their beer is just O.K., not my favorite. But I go here more for the atmosphere and the socializing than the beer. Their wine and cocktails are great though! I usually stick with those. Their bartenders/ servers are great, always fun to talk to. :)   It seems like they get a bad wrap on their food, but I think it's pretty good! I usually always order an app when I go, so it must be good :) Sometimes, their calamari has been soggy but it was still okay. All of their other appetizers are yum!!!   Most definitely a great place to go for Happy Hour, for a date nite, or with a group of friends :)   P.s. Order a slice of their Oreo pie. To die for! ;)"}
{"text":"Horrible food!!! Everything tasted like all they did was sprinkle salt all over it. Ordered the flat bread tapas and it was covered in salt! You could see all the salt crystals all over the pita bread and even on the lettuce they give you. Then I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese and it tasted even saltier! I will say though that they do give you a ton of lobster though. My boyfriend got the some chicken and mashed potatoes that was had way less salt so that was edible other than the chicken was over cooked. Worst meal I've ever had."}
{"text":"Started off with the Beer Flight, which is a good value at $6.25, my fiancé had a margarita that had no alcohol in it, so that received a ZERO VALUE for the $10.50 asking price.  She ordered a chopped salad and I ordered a Kobe beef hamburger. Both meals were very good, although the fries were served cold (well slightly warm but not hot) Our server was very good personable, helpful and attentive. I ordered a 20oz beer about halfway into the meal and it was about 2 oz under poured.  This is a personal pet peeve. Some will say \"its suppose to have that much head\" more than a half an inch for me is too much but that's just me.  Over all not a bad meal but not worth the $68 total price (including tip) So here is the breakdown  Ice tea - Ok Margarita - Crap Flight - good Chopped Salad - Good Kobe Burger - Good  Fries - Cold 20 oz beer - under poured  Happy hour prices were not honored on the patio.   Over all.... Meh. We probably will not go back."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday with our daughter and while our service was great, the food was atrocious! We each ordered different plates, but one common disappointment among them was the obnoxious amounts of salt! Even the asparagus (cooked to a perfected crunch) was too salty for complete enjoyment! My daughter's tenders were fried and then what seemed to be re-salted - I felt horrible for letting her ingest them! Needless to say, we will not be eating here again!   Oh - and a typical white napkin vs. a standard brown washroom paper towel would've been more appropriate at the table - especially with a small child's face to wipe up!"}
{"text":"I like the cold beer and the Apetizers. Perfect place to stop by after a movie. It's very convenient to go to and the people are nice!"}
{"text":"It's chain pub grub but the home brews make the mundane choices worth a visit.  Tip- the bar area is first come first serve for game nights."}
{"text":"Good food and beer.  Service was friendly and timely.  Get the bbq ribs... delicious!"}
{"text":"My friends and I met up to enjoy an evening out and visit. We arrived at 3 pm and sat down in a booth in the bar area for Happy Hour.  Our beginning of the evening started off very pleasant and the server/bartender was excellent!  After an hour and a half she informed us that she would be leaving as her shift was over!  We wanted to settle the bill with her since she had handled our orders and had provided excellent customer service.  The three of us continued to stay for another hour and half and not once were we approached by a server to ask if we needed anything else.  We needed another drink and our water glasses were empty the entire time!  As we left I asked to see the manager as I wanted to bring this to his attention.  As I explained the situation to him he didn't seem at all concerned and just said \"I'm sorry\".  The place was practically empty and he didn't even care about good customer service!!!!  Needless to say we are going to be taking our once a week venture someplace else where they are concerned with customer service!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place once before and enjoyed it (I had a second interview here). Maybe it was the fact that I was extremely hungry being out of work and needing a full meal or temporary insanity because when I went back today, that was not the case.  In short, here's what was wrong:  In our party of 8, the service was slow & not very attentive.  It took a long time for the food to come to the table. The food was not cooked as ordered, which was fixed but afterward, the food made us physically ill. We ate at 5 and still feeling the effects of the bad food at 12:20am.  I will probably never eat there again and I only had the lobster bisque which tasted nothing like lobster."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place...except for the beer anyway. I have to admit that this is mostly due to my taste in beer. I like the hops. Our waitress was great! When we needed something, anything, she was there. She was knowledgeable regarding beer and food. The food was great: we enjoyed the garlic fries, the bratwurst small plate and the goat cheese flatbread. The only beers were brewed according of the German purity law of some century and were too bland for me. The seasonal Saison was worth a pint. There were others that tasted good but I need to be assaulted by hops. It won't happen here. But...it is a good lunch."}
{"text":"Service is EXTREMELY slow and the food is pricey. Not so sure I'll ever come but or recommend it to anyone.."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the overall 3 star rating made me expect something middle-of-the-road. However, tonight's visit was lovely and all 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and drinks. We ordered the 7oz sirloin steak (one of the best my father-in-law has had! This comment is from someone who used to work in the high-end food supplier industry.), citrus salmon (my mother-in-law thought this was delicious), and veggie burgers (my husband and I both consumed our burgers with gusto). Service was pleasant, if a bit on the slow side, but in summary, we had a great dinner and would come to GB again. Perhaps next time we'll have room for dessert!  Tip: there is a parking garage directly west of Gordon Biersch and as of tonight (12/30/2016), parking is $1/hour."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, the food is always amazing.  The service can vary from average to above average and therefore I'm only giving it 4 stars.  This time I got the Gorgonzola Ribeye which was amazing!  The presentation made the steak look even more appealing than it already was.  Cooked to medium rare perfection along with the seasoning and gorgonzola butter made it mouth watering.  I've ordered burgers and sandwiches before and each time, they always knock it out of the park.  So if you are looking for some great food, a good atmosphere and typically above average service, Gordon Biersch is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was good, but our server was awful.  I believe her name was Lynn.  Very slow service, took forever to get her attention and was only nice when she dropped the bill.  I've been here before with great service and food, but this experience was the exception.  Hopefully next time I go it'll be better and I don't have Lynn."}
{"text":"I dined here with my friend who was in from out of town raving about how great it was, and the food... i was not wrong about.  Their chicken wings are about the best things since sliced bread.  Their beer sampler is one of the best, and I LOVE their salads.    BUT....... out waiter must have forgotten his manners, or never been taught them altogether.  I hear a lot of waiters biggest complaints are rude customers, but may I speak for myself in saying that I ALWAYS say please and thank you for everything and I'm usually awarded the same respect in return, but for this waitor, that just wasn't the case.  That turns me off right away when I'm dining out, especially when I am paying extra for their services.  I've been in the customer service industry for over 10 years now, and I know it's not always fun, but is it too much to ask for a little common courtesy?  Okay, I'm done rambling...  The food here is awesome.. so it's A-OK in my book ;)"}
{"text":"i have been going to Biersch for a long time, and it really went downhill for a while and I think I even got food poisoning at the one on paradise.  However, lately it has been very good and one my go to lunch spots.  The pot stickers are the best i've had anywhere and the garlic fries are always great.  Most everything i've orderers there the last 2-3 years has been great and the SW Chicken Sandwich is always really good.  Try the happy hour for cheap drinks and apps too!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever sat at the bar for fast service before a flight good luck   20 minutes later no beer or order after it took 15 mins to place order   Got up a left   Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Great service and large tvs well positioned for sports. The veggie burger was dry and a little stigy on the garlic fries.   Regular hamburger is good.   Would recommend and would have been 5 stars if the veggie burger was better and less stingy with fries. :). Now that I have given up on Antars this will be my new place for sports."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was horrible. Don't get the chicken wings, tasted like they pulled them out of the trash from last week."}
{"text":"The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places."}
{"text":"My first visit here was nice.  Not overwhelming, but comfy and cosy.  Next few visits were kind of blah, as I didn't particularly enjoy the food.  My most recent visit was a couple of days ago and I had a lovely time, mainly because of the company, the well-done food, and the charming server (who called me \"beautiful\"....sure, that may be cheesy, but what woman doesn't appreciate being called beautiful?).  The menu doesn't feature anything exotic or out-of-the-ordinary, but you will find your comfort food and your bar food and a decent selection of brews.  I like the food at 4Peaks (in AZ) and YardHouse better, but Gordon Biersch is a viable alternative."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with colleagues and ordered the creole chicken from the \"lighter menu\" (items are under 575 calories).  It was pretty good!  I was pleasantly surprised.  The last few times I visited GB, I was not impressed with the service or the food quality, given the prices and the hype (\"meh\" food and servers who were obviously faking friendly service).  Our server was training a newbie, so the service wasn't stellar overall, but they tried to be upbeat and friendly.  One suggestion for the staff: if you know that a party is coming in for a work lunch, you may want to suggest separate checks from the get-go.  Most of the time, your customers will appreciate the gesture.  3* until my next visit proves otherwise."}
{"text":"Tempe location is on the second floor with an elevator available. Sat on the Mill St side balcony which gives a birds eye view of street action. Ordered a Mosaic IPA and Citrus pale ale. Both were very tasty on a warm sunny afternoon. For lunch we ordered the Pecan Chicken and the Pecan Salmon. Both were awesome and done to perfection. Service was excellent. Don't understand why this place is only three stars. Maybe because a bucket of Buds for $6 isn't available."}
{"text":"I love it! Cool atmosphere with a variety of Televisions, and a brewery on site (though I hate beer). They made my burger JUST right, (I like my meat like I like my women, bloody and with a little fight left in 'em) and it was delicious! Service was friendly and prompt, food came instantly. GET PECAN CHICKEN. omg get it, but it's cooked with sherry so, be en guarde.  Transfriendly- yyyyea? yea prolly like a little wierd."}
{"text":"Ah...finally a brewery in Las Vegas! So happy we found this place, I love trying new stout beers!   Came here during happy hour which is from 3:30-6:30pm. Not quite sure if that's their only happy hour. Started off with the oatmeal stout beer, which I believe is a limited beer. They have different beers every few weeks depending on what they have in stock. For our appetizer, we had the Southwest wonton nachos which is super big for an appetizer! It's served with wonton chips, black beans, red onions, guacamole, and tomatoes. There's a sauce that's swirled in it, that honestly is everything!   For my entree I had the smoked chicken and mushroom pasta. So yummy!!!! I love pasta, but I'm usually very picky with it because I like a good cream sauce, but not too saucey, if that makes any sense. And this pasta is just that! Comes with shrimp and chicken and a bit of Parmesan which is just perfect! My boyfriend ordered the California chicken sandwich with a side of garlic fries. Those garlic fries.....so so good! The fries are perfectly cooked with bits of garlic and Parmesan. Just perfect.   After we got our tab, our server offered us a stamp card which allows you to accumulate points everytime you come in, and once you reach a certain amount of points, you can turn them into cash towards your next bill! We so loved this! Thank you Gordon!"}
{"text":"It was a few years back, but we had a server who called everyone boss, like \"what do you need boss?\"... Well I hope he is the boss of this place by now, because it was the best service I've ever received from a waiter!  This guy was on top of everything, not overbearing, but just had a sense of when we needed something and got it quick and was very personable as well.  Food was good too."}
{"text":"This is my first time here in Tempe, My steak was cooked right and the bartender (I think her name was Kimberly) was really awesome she never let my drink run empty and was friendly when I asked questions about the area. Customer service is highly underrated!"}
{"text":"Several years ago we went to a Gordon Biersch out in Glendale or somewhere across the metro area, and had a mediocre to bad experience, so it wasn't high on our list for a return visit.  But then I was reading about their beers, which generally stay true to German brewing and thought, what the heck, let's give them another try.  Nevermind the fact that I'm not boozing it up now that I'm exercising more.  Well, I'll have a sippy or two, but that's it.    Back in early September we stopped in and my husband ordered a Gose ($4), which was a nice rendition of that type, and we shared the Southwest nachos ($10) & the fish and chips ($16.59).  Everything was nicely prepared and we really enjoyed the nachos made with won ton chips.  We had gotten signed up for their Passport rewards, and had $10 towards our total, so that made it a $22.20 lunch for two.  Perfect.  A couple days ago we stopped in again.  I ordered the chicken schnitzel ($12.99) and my Mr. ordered the artisan grilled cheese ($9.99).  I loved my dish.  I've had it before and it's always prepared nicely, with the chicken pounded out thin, lightly breaded, and fried perfectly so it's moist and tender.  The spaetzle with fresh mushrooms is a nice touch as well.  This is great comfort food to me.  My husband enjoyed his grilled cheese, but it was generally a lot more bread than innards, and he said he probably wouldn't get it again.  Their housemade chips were a nice accompaniment, and I swiped more than my fair share.  We had gotten an email to get 25% off, so with the Marzen that my husband ordered, our dinner was $22.88.    So far, great food and great beers.  The service has been a little shaky, but nothing too terrible.  Overall we have a great time at this location and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Just recently discovered this place while in Syracuse NY. Wanted my brother and his family to experience it on my trip to Vegas. I had the top sirloin medium well. Perfection!  Roasted garlic mashed potatos and Apple cider cole slaw as my sides. DELISH!!!  My brother had potato croquettes as one of his sides and they were really really good!!  I want that as my side next time. LoL. We got there early so there was no wait. As we dined the place got busier and busier, maybe a bit on the noisy side. Waiter was attentive and friendly. My 2 experiences at GB has definitely made me a fan, a place I wish to go to more often. Just sucks that the nearest one to where I live is nearly four hours away"}
{"text":"I don't really like Vegas...but GB brewery feels very homey to me. I went there many years ago and just loved the vibe and the beer selection. Solid pub food, comfy vibe, outside seating that's cool in the evening and a great beer selection. The Marzen is my favorite. I'll come back here next time in LV...'cause it doesn't feel like LV."}
{"text":"Skimpy skimpy pours on wine, almost ridiculously so.  Food was mediocre. Server was nice but inattentive.  Would not go back... Too many better choices in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way back to Cali because it was the only place that had grass-fed beef. Enjoyed my grass-fed sliders and the homemade chips were the best!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place to go for brunch on a beautiful spring afternoon in Vegas. Their flavored teas were yummy. Not too tiny of a patio area for seating. I'd skip the BBQ Chicken pizza next time, but their sliders and breakfast burrito was good.  The service was pretty good.   With all these wonderful restaurants in town, I would still considering going back to this one... I think that says something :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty comfortable.  The chairs and booths are really comfortable and a great spot for large groups.  The service can use a real improvement.  6 of us met there for dinner not knowing that there was a Coyotes game going on.  The bar was really busy but the dining area was, at best, half full.  Our food took forever and my glass of water was empty most of the meal.  I had ordered wine and asked for it to come with my meal but he gave it to me with the waters along w/ everyone else.    the food was alright.  pretty basic.  the meal could have been at Chili's, Applebees or any other assorted chain.  I would like to check their happy hour out one day, I sense it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Very poor attentiveness by server. It took over 23 minutes to get my beer and food. Servers need to realize to get a tip you have to serve your customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Hughes Center office complex and given its convenient location to the offices there, I've had many a business lunch in this location.  The food is good and they're a good spot for lunch unless there is a convention going on in which case they are a lot busier and service tends to slow down.    Seating at the bar or high tops around the bar is a quick and easy solution for solo or couple diners.  They have several tvs going with whatever big sport events are on at the time and/or financial news if nothing else is happening.    My biggest problem with Gordon Biersch is something that many people probably enjoy--they frequently change the menu--at least once a quarter if not more.  I joke that I have to re-read the menu every time I go because it changes so often.  The reason I don't like it is that some of my favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  One my favorite meals here is the Housemade Tacos.    GB is famous for its garlic fries, but for those of you who don't want garlic breath all day, the fries are just as good without the garlic.  Overall, this is a good place that I would recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Bill the server was nice, however, the short old brunette with blondish tips bar tending lady was straight up rude. On top of that their legendary garlic fries was definitely not legendary, barely any garlic on our fries. I miss the old Gordon Biersch where everyone was nice and their garlic fries was loaded with garlic. Oh and my sister who is vegan said their veggie burger was the worst she ever ate."}
{"text":"I have had this spot bookmarked for while to try, as I pass it all the time. I looked up the hours and excited to check out the late night happy hour menu. I tried the buffalo wings with side of sweet potatoes. I am sad to say I was disappointed with the quality of the wings. The wings were delivered fast but served cold(in my opinion) and lacked flavor. The sweet potato fries were mediocre.   I would not visit this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Went in with some coworkers for reverse happy hour, having never been to this restaurant before. We ended up walking out because we sat for almost 20 minutes without our waitress making an appearance after she dropped off our menus. There couldn't have been more than three tables occupied when we walked in. I get that it's happy hour but we still would have tipped you nicely. It's not as though the happy hour food was cheap anyway. Happy hours are scheduled during a restaurant's slowest times in an effort to bring more customers in, but better customer service would definitely help too."}
{"text":"Definitely, a 4.3 but i will round it down to a 4.  Walking in on a saturday night at 6pm, there was surprisingly not much of a wait. Maybe ten minutes. We requested for a booth, which is why we had a bit of a wait.  My husband and step dad headed to the bar to get a couple beers. Marzen was the name if I remember correctly.  We were seated towards the middle, with a waiter named Scott. He was very personable and friendly. He opened up to us about how our 2 year old daughter reminded him of his daughter who is 15 months. Instantly our daughter gravitated to him and his warm personality. He asked if we wanted something for her to munch on while we waited. YES! Please!  While waiting to pick out our meals, Scott brought my daughter a big bowl of fruit filled with grapes, cantalope, melon, and pineapple. She loved it. Kept her entertained too.  After looking at the large menu, we decided to start with an app, calamari. I loved it. YUM. It came with two sauces. A regular red marinara, and then a different tarter lemony, mustardy sauce. It was great. Very unusual. Never had that with calamari before.  As our meals, I ordered the lobster mac n cheese. ($20) It was very light, buttery and refreshing. There was plenty of lobster, in small bite sized pieces. Cooked to perfection. Ive had it in pasta before and always found it over cooked. The shrimp was delicious and a nice pair. It was usual because it came with bow tie pasta instead of the usual macaroni. A nice change. It was a good sized mount, but after eating a bit of the app i could only finish half. My step dad and husband had no problem finishing off the rest.  My step dad and husband got the steak. ($22) Dad got it with veggie and mash potatoes. Hubby got it with fruit and garlic fries. I certainly made sure to try a bit of everything they had. The mash potatoes were full of garlic and potato skins. YUCK, i hate skins. The garlic fries were very tasty and very well seasoned. The steak on both, were cooked to perfection. My step dads was medium rare and extremely tender. I made sure to go back for second bites on that. The veggies were a type of medley, of zucchini and carrots. I noticed the portions were a little smaller than i expected  My daughter got the mac n cheese with fruit and asked for an extra side, which was french fries. ($5) Scott had no problem giving us a second side for no extra charge. Sweet! Her mac n cheese tasted just like the kraft type, which is her favorite. French fries were medium sliced.  All the food came out piping hot which is a very nice change to some of the restaurant Ive been to before. I actually burned my tongue on my lobster/shrimp pasta.   For dessert we ordered, the apple cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream AND their brownie and ice cream drizzled with carmel and chocolate sauce. Both were barely warm, almost cold but they were still really good. It took 20 minutes for our desserts, which was ridiculous. Thank goodness my daughter was preoccupied with crayons and the guys were busy with the football game on the tv. I'm sure they would have been the highlight of our meals had they been hot. The waiter Scoot apologized and took both desserts off our bill and said he was sorry everything took so long because the kitchen was backed up.   other than a few bumps in the road the customer service was outstanding and the food was very good. We def will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very average burger joint.  A little expensive for what you get.  Didn't know any other places in Tempe."}
{"text":"What a huge huge disappointment.  And the 1 star is for the excellent brewery beers, that's it.  Everything else was failure from the service, to the portions, to the menu that can't decide if it's pub food, or burgers, or a Tapas place, they should have just stuck to pub grub. First the appetizers were the smallest undersized portions I have ever seen.  Buffalo wings which were tasty but you got like 5.  Not enough toast points for the crab dip, and the mussels were a joke, literally only 6 were served and 2 didn't even open, plus they were under seasoned.  The bratwurst appetizer needed triple more bratwurst with a beer cheese infused dipping sauce instead or marzen mustard.  The pretzel it came with was very good, and the garlic fries were decent also.  So food was overpriced and undersized and the waiter was a ghost.  Worst brewery pub I have ever been too."}
{"text":"Good food great service.. Hardly had to wait to be seated.. Awesome Waitress, she was on top of everything never had to ask for anything."}
{"text":"Eeeeh. What can I really say about Gordon Biersch. Below expectations? Poor value?  First thing - our bartender had to say \"bro\" every couple seconds. Drove me batty. Also had no clue what an IBU was and tried steering me away from their seasonal beer because it \"comes in a smaller glass\" (it was a 10%abv beer. of course its not served in a larger glass). I'm not looking for cicerone level knowledge - but come on... It's a brewery/restaurant.   The beer: I was very underwhelmed. I tried both their standard IPA and season IPA - not impressed. Ended up ordering their Pilsner (hard to mess up a pilsner). Also along side grabbed a bloody mary. The bloody was nothing to get excited about but I wasn't expecting anything really from it. However - for a place that is a \"brewery\" I expected the beers to be quite a bit better. Nothing really to write home about, very round and bland. Also expected the bartenders to at least have SOME beer knowledge.  Food: The food was actually really good! I had the crab/artichoke dip and the tenderloin sliders. Food temp was great! Food quality was great! I would come back for the food over anything else.  Value: When I visited Gordon Biersch I came for happy hour. For two apps/small plates, one beer and one bloody my tab came to $40. Not exactly \"happy hour\" pricing - despite having ordered items that were supposed to be \"happy hour\". Price point was the biggest let-down of all actually. At $40 for a beer, well vodka drink and two apps - you can dine at some phenomenal restaurants here in Vegas. This clearly is not one of them.  The food its self is good - but at the price point there is much better. Because of the poor value I would probably not try this place again."}
{"text":"A Friday Happy Hour Meetup group no less. This place said NO to separate checks, so many of our group left. Those that stayed ended up with a nice waitress. The other waiter sat \"waiting\" for customers, during the 2 hours I was there he got no customers...go figure! The appetizers during a Happy Hour are $8.99 for 3 small tacos, for 1 example. Great tasting but Happy Hour is for lowered prices. I had a 16 oz. Wit, good tasting but again during Happy Hour a 16 oz. could have been a bit better in price. I know now why the other 2 locations are permanently closed. Never go here again when there are so many other brewery Happy Hour restaurants in this great town."}
{"text":"Every restaurant who makes you feel as though it's a privilege to be there while making you wait to get served always gets a single star. Good location, bad service. I found grumpy cat and she works as a receptionist at Gordon Biersch. It's time for a customer training overhaul."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Gordon Biersch because I live very close and it was an easy choice. I was surprised by the variety of the menu and the servers seem to be very knowledgeable on the different alcohol and food. I ordered the pecan crusted chicken and the mashed potatoes as well. The rice wasn't very good, but it may not have been my taste. The only complaint I have is the staff seems to be a little stand offish."}
{"text":"You really cant go wrong with their bar menu, their house draft beers, and of course their garlic fries! I'm not a fan of their whole menu and how expensive everything is, but I don't mind sitting up at the bar, garbing a few small bites and chasing them down with some craft brews. But if you are looking for a nice meal and maybe a date night this place isn't bad for that either."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here Saturday (during the Art Festival) and the food was ok, not bad but not OH MY GOD good either. When we got there we were seated immediately and waited, and waited. Then other people started to be seated and waited on before us, needless to say, that wasn't making points. Finally our server came and took our order and we finally got something to drink!"}
{"text":"This is a brew house with pretty good food. I don't often order salads as my entire meal but the grilled chicken Caesar (I sub ranch dressing) is fresh and has a lot of chicken on it. If I lived in PHX I would eat here once a week. Service was good also."}
{"text":"Fun place for cold beer and good, casual food.  We closed up a trade show at 9:00 pm and went there - had a great time.  They brew an excellent selection of beer.  The food is good too."}
{"text":"Ok I just have to say this. Don't fu^%ing offer Kobe beef hamburgers and then not be willing to cook them medium rare. And then tell your waitress it's Nevada state law. I'm not a tourist. I fu*%ing LIVE here. I can go to any number of restaurants in Las Vegas and get a medium rare hamburger. It's like offering sushi grade tuna but only allowing you to get it breaded and fried. Such a waste. it wasn't even my order. It was my friend's order. But the more I think about it the angrier I get. I wouldn't normally even do a review of a chain restaurant, because I figure that's what I get for going to a chain restaurant. But I guess I just wanted you all to know.  Other than that, the food was meh. Not as good as I remembered. Crab artichoke dip was good. Waitress was nice and attentive. I just can't quite get past the kobe burger thing. I can't. Oh and apparently the hostess thought it was proper form to look bored and walk away talking while seating us. Probably didn't help this review to be seated by someone who makes you feel like you're inconveniencing them by wanting to sit down. \"Sorry, are we bothering you?\""}
{"text":"Don't come to GB on Saint Patrick's day. Really, don't.  Why? Its simple- it just sucks. The place is eeeeeeeempty at noon (it IS St paddys after all) yet the service is ridiculously, unacceptably, slow. They only started thinking of drink specials at 1pm the same day, kind of like an after though, \"ooh its a massive drinking holiday today? man, we might have to make a green shot or something\". They don't do discounted St Paddy's specials and the place is not decorated with a single balloon, hat or necklace.  Seriously people, you're a German bar... have some holiday compassion for your fellow Irish folk. People are there to get shiftaced, and seriously, you aint helping.  What doesn't change from holiday to every day drinking is their food and drink. The garlic fries were, meh, cold and flacid (yes I could have said \"not crispy\", but seriously, its more graphic this way). Their beers are ok but the selection is a tad small. Our server brought an extra shot by mistake and she drank it, then charge us for it without telling us. She did that twice and no I didn't really appreciate it. The check separation was appreciated but after such a slow service we really didn't want to stay there any further, there are other bars with cheaper drinks and better attitude... and that's where we're going."}
{"text":"Things are getting better!  Two trips now have been very good.  Very good salads, sliders, flat bread, service, etc.  We haven't done a full dinner in a while but will soon."}
{"text":"Typical chain.  Food is ok, service is good, and everything is clean."}
{"text":"Worst service. We made reservations and still had to wait 20 min to be seated. Food was ok but it was delayed and we missed part of the game. All I heard was oh we are backed up. Don't go there before games. We waited 35 min for bill and it still was wrong. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food is great and the Hef is the best of all the breweries.  I am writing the review to note that the hostess went out of her way to help us take a Mother's Day photo after we left the restaurant.   It's people like that, that really make a day special!  This location is amazing!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is, like most chains, consistent in quality and service. This is why we keep going back.  I like the fact that they offer their own house brand of beer (and great options) but you can also choose from your favorite American and imported brands, if that's what you want. They have some good options for cocktails, and their prices are what you would expect - a bit high, but not skyrocket.  Again, food is consistent. My favorite is the Gorgonzola Pear Salad which is great with their hefeweisen. Their burgers are first rate and quite large - my friend and I split one for lunch once and it was the perfect size portion for each of us. We were thrilled that the server was nice enough to plate it for us, even splitting the fries - many places will just bring you one plate as the serving and a smaller plate for sharing (why don't people think?). Although the desserts seem tempting, I've always been too full to sample them.  I've been there when the service was very good, and when it was just OK, but I've never had any major service issues and other than what's noted above, nothing spectacular either.   The decor is nice and although the ceilings are high the restaurant isn't too loud, surprisingly. They have an outdoor patio and a full bar as well. The mall location is great - we often go there before or after a movie.  Overall it's a good restaurant, and you know what to expect - you aren't likely to be surprised one way or the other. It's a great place to go with a group of people too, and they will likely be what you remember about the dinner, rather than the food, service or atmosphere. Isn't that really how it should be?"}
{"text":"I typically avoid chain restaurants. This one drove that home. We went here before a concert and not knowing what was near the venue, we picked this place. I'm a sucker for Schnitzel with Spätzle, and it was on the menu so I ordered it. It was horrible. It was covered in capers and drowning in lemon juice. So much juice I could have poured it into my water, added a pack of sugar and had lemonade. There were more capers than Spätzle itself.  I will not be back. Sad, because the Czech Pilsner was pretty good. It's kind of like meatloaf. If you have it on the menu, it better be good. This was not, and was not even authentic in any way."}
{"text":"Tried this place on St Patrick's Day and service was beyond terrible and there wasn't that many people!  Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday night and stood waiting to be seated or at least greeted or acknowledged. Obviously this restaurant isn't interested in having customers or making any money. Fail fail fail."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been back to this place.  It has a good Happy Hour.  The cocktails are $6 and wines are $2 off.  I had the Moscow Mule and a glass of red wine.  The HH food is ok, nothing really spectacular.  I had the NOLA tuna, which was ok, but it I had a feeling it has been pre plated or something.  First it came out in under 5 minutes and second the tuna, besides being super cold, looked a little dry.  My friend ordered the artichoke dip, it was ok.  My other friend ordered the cobb flatbread and that was the best of them all.  We shared a bread pudding and that was  pretty good and huge.  Overall this is an ok place to hang out with friends.  The HH said until 6:30 online, however our server said it was until 7, not sure if it is for the summer only."}
{"text":"I go to Gordon Biersch a few times a week for lunch, this is my first review after coming a few years. I generally sit at the Bar with my favorites bar tender Andy. Since I come during lunch hours I don't usually order the beer but I have tried some of their in house selections. One of the main reasons I come back to GB is due to their wide  variety of options on the menu, not to mention I can order a full lunch of side selections for under $10 . Side of chicken $3.00 side of mash potatoes $2.50 side of veggies 2.50 . Another sandwich I like to order is the California chicken club or the chicken BLT with garlic fries or replace them with any side.  Their menu is always changing. They even let you order your side of salmon or chicken blackened if you'd like. The burgers are good the salads are descent.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because sometimes you have to know what to order when you come here. The chicken isn't amazing quality sometimes I need to order it well done, and the service sometimes away from the bar can be slow during lunch hours but today the service was great."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because I've gotten better at cooking my own food.  Perhaps it's because I've been to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe, and I had fond memories of it.  Either way, I really didn't like the food I just had there.   SERVICE ======== Attentive & prompt.  Not maître d' service, but not slophouse, either.  Just good, old fashioned, \"let me keep your glass full and make sure you don't want anything else\" service.  BEER ====== Reasonable, but if this place is a brewery they really should have more involvement with the beer.  Pair beers to food.  Have more than one beer that constantly gets put into recipes.  (They really keep bangin on that 'marzen' beer in recipes -- why not be a little creative?).  Hell -- maybe even have free mini beer tasters.  But I digress.  FOOD ======= I hope you didn't come here for the food, because it's pretty bland.  -1 star for the food, big time.  I ordered the crab & lobster cakes, and it was a mistake.  Bland cakes, tiny dish of tartar sauce and large mound of (plain!) white rice on the plate?  WTF!   I ordered the triple chocolcate brownie for dessert, thinking that it was hard to screw that up, but (freeze dried?) brownie just doesn't cut it, folks.  -1 star again (and a pile of disappointment) for screwing up the brownie.  PRICE ====== Where this place is truly in a universe of its own is price.  Those blandcakes I had?  $25!   $15 for meatloaf?  Really!?? -1 star for snooty  Scottsdale prices without the snooty Scottsdale food.  All in all, a sub-par experience at a champagne price.  Skip it.  You're not missing much."}
{"text":"Garlic fries weren't anything too spectacular. I had the California chicken sandwich. Even though I had to send the first chicken back for being undercooked, it was really good. Flavors were just right."}
{"text":"The beer was good. Service was good. Unfortunately the happy hour nachos and tacos left alot to be desired."}
{"text":"I really want to like Gordon Biersch being that I live a block away. It's just every time I come in, the service is just not there. Whenever I come in, it never fails that I have to wait 10 minutes before I am acknowledged and this happens whether I am sitting in the dining room, at a bar top in the bar or at the bar. Whenever i come in the restaurant isn't busy i usually see the employees doing side work or chatting amongst themselves. Then after I am acknowledged it usually takes another 15 minutes before my drink comes. The food is usually decent when I finally get it but my server usually disappears and never comes to check on me or fill my cup with water. I usually have to flag someone down to get my bill. I give three stars because when I am able to order food, it usually is good. My sole reason I keep coming to GB is that I enjoy their southwest egg rolls."}
{"text":"Baja tacos 5/5 Southwest egg rolls 2/5 Garlic fries 4/5 Pork sliders 2/5 BBQ chicken pizza 5/5 Turtle cheese cake 4/5 Apple bread pudding 3/5 Waitress 4.9"}
{"text":"Had a black and blue burger with the super garlicky fries.  Burgers and fries are in point!  Nice selection of beer.   Good casual atmosphere to hang out with friends after work."}
{"text":"Wow. I would say the service sucks here but that would imply that they actually have service. Please hire new wait staff. Fail."}
{"text":"First time at this GB and first time for any GB since Yelping. Arrived at 1 on a Friday for lunch. The patio was pretty full and the tables inside were 1/4 full.   Jason greeted me quickly and I ordered a raspberry iced tea and a Marzen BBQ burger. It came with sauce, bacon and cheddar, plus garlic fries on the side. It came to $16.25 plus tip, which is high for a burger.   My lunch arrived in 7-8 minutes. The fries were killer. Lots of garlic, some parsley and salt. Just perfect. The burger was very good, if a bit messy but burgers with BBQ sauce always are. It was also huge. The veggies were crisp, bun nicely toasted and cooked just like I asked-medium rare. After a few, Jason refilled my tea and offered me one to go as well - nice.   I recommend GB for a tasty, if expensive, lunch."}
{"text":"This is the most overpriced food in Tempe.  It has a great spot on mill and you can watch everyone go by, but too bad you couldn't do that and not buy anything.  If you want to sit on this block, you might as well go to hooters across the way.  At least you could save some money and eat the same quality food.  There are many good places to eat on Mill, so skip this one."}
{"text":"Our go-to happy hour spot in Summerlin. Great drinks, great apps and great bartenders! I love how there is no video poker or smoking which makes it feel like the good old bars I'm used to in California. My boyfriend and I come here weekly to watch Giants games and get our happy hour fix. We've tried many, many, many other happy hours but nothing compares to our old faithful GB! With the Passport rewards points we get $80 gift cards after spending x amount of dollars here...which we would have spent regardless. All in all our favorite local hangout in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of micro breweries. Gordon Biersch is cool... a little \"chain-like\", but the ambiance is great.  I felt like I was under dressed.  I had the seafood cobb, which was awesome. They use REAL crab here... thank god.  Hubs had a large burger... he loved it and loved the garlic fries.   I had the Hefeweizen and hubs had a couple Schwarzbiers. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"I have been the this location  six different times. All but once have been on Sunday to enjoy the live music. However, for the last three times we have had terrible service. The music is great, the food is good, but the service is so bad that it ruins the whole experience. After having bad service from the same server two different times we decided to sit in a totally different area, away from the section we prefer, in hopes of having a better service. Well, yesterday was the icing on the cake. As usual the food and music was good. But the service was absolutely horrible. Ilene, needs to either receive further training or consider a job where she doesn't have to interact with others. Not only was her appearance questionable (I.e. dirty shirt, hair not tied back, and just overall unkept ) her lack of customer need awareness was evident. The final straw was when, I once again had to leave our table to get her, I walk up and hear her complaining about my friends and me to another table. But their expression they didn't care to hear about our group asking for, \"too much\" . Finally, we had to request a manager with a different server."}
{"text":"We stopped by early in the evening so the bar was picking up for happy hour as people got out of work but the rest of the restaurant was still pretty empty. We were greeted and seated right away and drinks were at the table in a matter of minutes. The order of cheese curds wasn't far behind them. I love their cheese curds with the candied bacon and dipping sauce. Order the large as the small goes too quickly. We also had burgers and the chicken schnitzel. The food was good and everyone enjoyed their meal, we finished by sharing the apple crostini   The service was friendly and attentive and the bill was reasonable. It's definitely worth checking out if in the area to grab a beer or a happy hour special."}
{"text":"Darn. They changed the menu and got rid of my favorite seared ahi salad. Boooo. Not happy. Guess I'll have to find another place next time. Other than that always good food and service here."}
{"text":"Stopped by before the Coyotes game the other night. Place was bustling and initially the host wanted to seat the 2 of us at a 6 top table. There was a nice little booth in the next section over and I asked if we could sit there as I'd hate to waste a big top table like this on just the two of us. We were accommodated but warned that the server in that section had a big table and so there might be a wait. We didn't mind. We weren't in a hurry.  Well thank goodness we weren't in a hurry because we never met the server for that section. Not once. Luckily husband struck a repoire with the manager when we asked about the smaller table because after 20 minutes of no contact whatsoever from anyone, it was he who came and took our order. The food runner was the one to fix our incorrect order and find the beers at the bar for us that we'd ordered. I guess we shoulda taken the big top after all. It was the food runner who brought us our bill. And it was the food runner who we tipped in cash because he deserved it. But not once did the actual server for that section come to see us.   It was an ok visit and the southwest nachos were delish. I'd go back if only just for those. :)"}
{"text":"Solid chain, so I will hold off on the major ratings here. Good beers, decent enough bar food, tons of tvs, and a very open space. Its one of those \"safe bet\" for a chain spot.  You know exactly what you are going to get here, plus you can drink beers, and eat garlic fries, then stand uncomfortably close to your friends and stink them out"}
{"text":"Let me say first, it doesn't matter when we go, who serves us, there  is always either issues or bad service. It is always such bad service here. It takes too long to have your order taken, too long for food, and heaven forbid you get any drinks refilled. The waitress acts like she has something better to do then wait on us. I try talking to her, and she is gone before i can even talk! They are not even that busy to get such bad service. The food was very good though."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here today and decided to make it an early birthday lunch since I received an online 2 for 1 coupon.  This location never seems very crowded, and it was a beautiful day on the patio.  Our server was very bubbly and knowledgeable and gave us plenty of time to decide...we were in no rush and their menu is fairly extensive.  They do have a special Octoberfest menu which includes a variety of german entrees including bratwurst, frankfurters, schnitzel etc.  I felt like eating fairly healthy, so I had the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich (see pics) with the cajun remoulade on the side.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the bun fresh and the garlic fries are amazing, smothered in fresh garlic and parsley!  I only had a few and my partner indulged in the rest.  He had the BBQ chicken pizza which has a nice kick from the Marzen BBQ sauce.   It's definitely a big serving for one person, but he was really hungry.  He started off with the house salad which looked delicious and includes bacon, egg and candied pecans.  I would definitely recommend this place....great food, solid value, excellent service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today.  Arrived just in time for happy hour so we decided to sit in the bar area.    Happy hour menu is the way to go if you're not super hungry or if you want to save room for dessert.    $40 for two included grass fed beef sliders, mini brat sliders, 2 GB beers and the warm Apple bread pudding for dessert.    Everything was excellent including the service!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is really nice, and the servers are attentive.  The problem is that the food is not good and it's overpriced. Wife got fish and chips, which was probably the best thing we got. I got the bratwurst slider and roasted veg salad. The Brat slider came out cold, and the salad was under-dressed. Both were under seasoned.  The kids menus at $5.50 or so we're pretty solid, with a half-dozen options.  I didn't feel like I got my money's worth from a $53 tab for two adults and three kids."}
{"text":"Wife and I love this place. Always top notch food and service, and their Hefeweizen is pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas we visited this place and having never been to one of these we did not know what to expect. It was very busy and we had to wait for a table for 6 We were seated and we were greeted by our sever right away. Our drink order was taken and we ordered an appetizer. The manager Johnny Diaz , who was also helping with tables,came by and greeted us, he was super friendly and professional, asked if we had ever been here before and wished us a pleasant visit. Our food was everything we expected and then some. We all tried different dishes and everyone was very happy. We plan to return when we are back in the area. Our server was very attentive and helpful with the informaiton of what to do in Las Vegas/."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and nice atmosphere.  I liked that they had a lighter menu with fewer calories - definitely a bonus!"}
{"text":"I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but I'm nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once \"why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? \" I don't know. Maybe I'm a masochistic eater. Actually, I'm just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didn't go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I don't even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is a great place to go with friends for a great selection of beers and food.  We had excellent service and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We were spending Memorial Day checking out thrift shops when we got hungry, and decided to stop by  for some food and a beer (or two).  We hit right at the lunch rush, but were quickly seated.  I had the Czech Style Pilsner, and my date tried the Hefewizen.  Both beers were excellent, full bodied and fresh.  The menu had so many choices, but we finally decided.  I had the loaded baked potato and salad, which was great choice.  The salad had candied nuts and lots of fresh veggies, and I even got the blue cheese dressing, which was creamy and fresh.  The Kobe Beef Burger was also tasty, only downside is they say they won't serve it less than medium. Guess they heard us, because it was still pretty pink when it came out.  The garlic fries were also tasty.  The staff was prompt and friendly, and the manager made the rounds to make sure everyone was enjoying their meals.  It was a perfect lunch for the last day of a long weekend."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch does not need any more positive press.  They are as crowded as can be during Happy Hour and when they have their tapping parties...both of which are good.  GB is an above average bar with an above average restaurant.  They have one of the better patios in the westside/summerlin  areas.  Their beer is okay.  I am a fan of the Marzen and their winter seasonal, the  Winterbock.    The wait staff does a real good job and the managers are great at this location.  That being said GB is too popular/crowded for me, and doesn't offer quite enough quality beers on a regular basis for me to come here more."}
{"text":"I love their ribeye gorgonzola. Good price, beer and food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and have a few beverages.  I was there last night to watch the NCAA tournament, and all was well. The bar is very spacious and comfortable, the service is very good, and the food is what you hope for at a restaurant. I'll be going back for sure. Go Bucky!!!"}
{"text":"While a little bit pricey, the food and service make up for it.  The location is awesome in Tempe and has both indoor and outdoor dinning.  The upstairs layout is a little funky once it gets crowded.  Service was quick and the food was served hot.  We had:    Chefs Sampler Steak Medallions with Crab Stuffed Shrimp Chilean Seabass A Lemonade/Peach/Vodka Concoction   We were SOO stuffed after the appetizer that we barely made it through our courses.  Would definitely go back as there were many other menu items to try!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I had been snacking all day so we weren't all that hungry. We shared the Filet Mignon Sliders with a super tender filet with housemade peppercorn mayo and Havarti. Crispy onions and arugula on the side. It was totally worth the 7.50. We had the beer sampler which was great to taste each one.   We went with a group of 12 women and our waitress was awesome, don't remember her name but she has blond hair. She was always checking on us.  Happy to see that there are some Gordon Biersch restaurants in CA. Can't wait to go back our friends food looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Great late night happy hour. Their seasonal IPA on tap was one of the better IPA's I've had. Also had their strawberry soda was quite tasty. Best part of our ding experience was the friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"I stumbled into GB this summer when I was at a conference in Scottsdale. Didn't really feel like paying an arm and a leg for hotel resort food so I ventured off into the desert, on foot, to find some yummy food.   I sat in the bar area since seating was at a premium in the restaurant. It was a Friday night. I ended up ordering a Margarita since it was national Tequila day. It was pretty good. For vegetarians there wasn't a lot of non-meaty foods to eat. I ended up ordering a bunch of different sides for my meal. The food was really tasty and didn't cost me too much.   Unfortunately, the service wasn't great and it did take a long time get served. But then again, it was a busy Friday so I didn't really mind. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I'll probably do a little more researching to find a place that's a little more local and a little less of a chain."}
{"text":"My parents were in town for a soccer tournament and wanted to take myself, my daughter, her teammate and mom to dinner.  They put us all in a great big booth, comfy and cozy.  Our server was VERY friendly and patient for my folks to make their selections.  My dad asks a few questions and sometimes things need to be repeated for the grandparents.  Our server gave good suggestions and affirmations and clarifications on the menu items. She also took the time to explain all the different types of beers.   Burgers were great - cooked to our specifications. The spinach salad looked amazing. My dad and daughter ordered 2 different chicken dishes.   We had a lovely time and I wish I remembered the server's name!   Sweet, courteous, affable.  Service makes the difference and when the food was delicious that was a huge bonus."}
{"text":"Got seated, barely acknowledged by the waiter. Had to ask for a menu. Asked a question about the menu...got some vague response because he appeared to be too busy for us. Walked out. Wont return. I hate shitty service.  bald. K*nt"}
{"text":"Happy Hour! I'm a huge fan of happy hour and Gordon Biersch has a pretty good one. $5 Specialty cocktails (I'm partial to the Kentucky Peach Punch) $5 apps and $1 OFF GB brews. The seasonal right now is the Festbier. It's their version of Oktoberfest Beer. An amber with a \"toasted maltiness and German Hersbrucker hops.\" It's pretty good at about 5% abv.   The veggie pizza is my favorite $5 appetizer but the tapas with flatbread and garlic fries are decent snack options too. The baja tacos with sauteed fish are a good, shareable choice as well. It's a serving of 4 tacos for $7 during happy hour.   The service in the bar area is usually great. If it gets crowded it can be a little slow but it's never been bad. I used to sit outside on the patio. I usually really enjoy dining alfresco but....I don't get very good service on the patio. It really shouldn't matter where you chose to sit but, I assure you, it does. I feel neglected when I'm out there so I tried sitting in the bar and it worked wonders.   As chain restaurants go, this one is a pretty good option. If I could throw in a half star for the brewery I'd give this location a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"I give this location four stars for the most improved.  Having gone from a eatery who only employed rude young adults, the customer service has greatly improved.  The food has always been well prepared by a very professional kitchen staff and the price is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"A very solid restaurant. Had a black and bleu burger with a garlic fries and was very happy. I asked for a medium burger, but it was definitely more done than medium. The bleu cheese sauce was great though and the onions on top were cooked perfectly. The garlic fries had real garlic pieces on them, but they were a little too salty. Everything was good, but nothing was great. A solid meal and reasonable prices though."}
{"text":"Talk about service!  My husband and I, Snowbirds from Seattle, came in on Sunday during a Cardinals game.  We wanted to view the Seahawks game AND since my husband  is in a wheelchair, we needed an accessible table.  The manager found  a t.v. w,here he could program the Hawks, and he set us up with a table at my husband's level.  We had a great lunch, super pizza, good cold beer and the Hawks won!  Great experience.  We will return!"}
{"text":"There are infinite numbers of restaurants and bars in the Las Vegas, and even with such a competitive market this is a place that consistently comes out at the very top of everyone's list of excellent food and the very best service in the entire city.  Living and working in Las Vegas for more than twenty years, I have a very good working knowledge of just about every possible place to enjoy the finest drinking and dining experience. My first choice to entertain my friends and clients is always Gordon Biersch on Paradise Road just north of Flamingo.  This staff here is the best and the food is carefully prepared and consistently delicious. I go there all the time because it is so consistently awesome.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in to Gordon Biersch today not sure what I was hungry for but my server Michael recommended the bruschetta chicken and oh my god!! it was delicious!! Michael took great care of me and was very entertaining this guy should do stand up, he is hilarious and not to mention really hot too"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now since I moved down the street.  I had the spinach dip which was delicious.  And I always get Cosmopolitans on happy hour for $6.  They are the best cosmos I've ever had.  They don't put a ton of cranberry juice in it.  I hate when you order a cosmo and they put so much juice in it it tastes like a weak mixed drink.  The bartenders do a great job here and are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch may not be the coolest place around, nor is it somewhere I'd choose to go for an actual meal, but they have great half-priced food for happy hour, such as southwest eggrolls and pizzas.  There's a regular happy hour as well as reverse happy hour on the weekends.  If you don't care about having sound, this is a decent place to comfortably watch a game on tv (good service, not crowded, etc).  Still only three stars since it's pretty generic overall, but GB has its pluses."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch has the best Hefeweizen, I know most people go for the Marzen but I am a sucker for the Hefe and GB has my favorite. Food is ok - hence the 4 stars.  Its standard grill style food, a little pricey but good.  Try the garlic fries! Service is always good at this location."}
{"text":"Always friendly service.  Even if you don't go for the beer, the food is always superb!!"}
{"text":"Really had mediocre service.  Waitress took our order and then disappeared.  Only served one drink and would have preferred another.  Food was okay, yet the steak on the salad was supposed to medium and was so rare that we needed to send it back. The plate came back with only some of the steak recooked...a few pieces were still raw/rare.  Lots of other really good restaurants around here.... we will probably not come back here."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a brewery tour and some Sex And The City 2 thing.  The tour was interesting and Dieter was cool as always.  After the tour my wife and I sat outside to have a beer and some dinner.  I had the wedge salad which was very good and the meat loaf.  The meat loaf was excellent.  They give you a huge portion and I probably shouldn't have eaten it all but I did anyway.  The taste was excellent and the addition of sausage was a nice touch though a bit on the salty side.  The Sex And The City thing was pretty stupid and didn't really mesh with the brewery thing.  They just had some girly drink specials all sponsored by Absolut.  I didn't have anything and I still don't want to see the movie.  I still don't understand why this place doesn't have a regular happy hour.  They have a reverse one which is pretty much useless but I guess it is better than nothing."}
{"text":"Service was really friendly.  Nice ambiance and very clean.  Good beer.  My Kobe beef burger was over cooked - I asked for medium rare but it was more like medium well.  This was a bit of a bummer because it is quite a pricey burger."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a brewery and our party was quite hungry by the time we got here. Our initial plan was to try the Firefly restaurant which was pretty much across the street, but it was packed and we didn't want to wait an hour. It was last Saturday night August and we were bummed and hungry. So we ended up walking across the street to Gordon's. I got the BBQ chicken pizza which was surprisingly delicious. I also ordered the NY strip steak with veggies and ordered it medium rare but of course it came out medium-medium well.  I was a little disappointed in that but ate it anyway. The flavor was good but a little tough since it was over cooked. Also ordered the gorgonzola pear salad and a beer.  That all came out to about $50.  Not overly priced at all!  Not  a place I would frequent in Vegas,  but it wasn't too bad!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Interesting pizza. Solid choice."}
{"text":"This place seems like an original pub-like restaurant, but it has a more American feel to it.  And the decor is pretty new. I did try one of their handcrafted beers.  I'm not much of a beer fan, but their Golden Export was light and tolarable than most beers.  There's still that \"beer taste\", but it's not that bitter and heavy as some of the beers I've had.  I do like the service there.  It was St. Patrick's Day, and I wanted to have some green beer.  When I first asked for it, they replied with that they don't offer it,  but the waiter was kind enough to make a request to the bartender.  Soon afterwards, I got my green beer for St. Patty's Day.  Yay! :-)  There wasn't anything that stuck out to me on the menu. For the food portion, I decided to order a simple seafood cobb salad.  Can't go wrong with that.  At first I thought that $14 for a salad is a bit over priced, but man, th portion was huge.  A huge bowl was placed before me and I started to chow down.  The fresh real crab and baby shrimp scattered throughout the salad and added a nice twist to the traditional cobb salad.  The ingredients were fresh and the lettuce was crisp.  I would have liked it better if there was more seafood in the dish.  A vinaigreete works beautifully with cobb salads.  With 4 different different housemade vinaigrettes to choose from, they all seemed great to compliment the salads.  I tried to the Marzen balsamic vinaigrette by the recommendation of the server.  It has the tangy balsamic taste, but not overwhelming to mask the light flavors of the seafood in the salad.  An average score for pretty good service, but so-so selection and food taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gordon's. The atmosphere is really chill. I come here about once a week  with a group of friends and never had a bad experience. It's really cool that we keep getting the same waitress and she knows my drink order. They have the best Reverse happy hour 9-cl. $5 cocktails a handful to choice from. $3.50 in house beers and $2.00 off a glass of wine. (I had 2 glasses myself ) yummy! Anyways great place to come to and Lindsay the waitress is awesome."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Gordon Biersch to eat anything other than fries since...well, ever!  Way back when I used to come here to swing dance in their dining room.  No joke!  They had a live band and pushed the tables away and scads of kids would come out and dance for hours and just eat their fries.  I always thought their fries were good.   I went the other night and was acutally impressed with how good the food was.  I had the Cedar Plank Pecan Crusted Salmon, and it was delightful.  The fish was fresh and the dill cream sauce a great accompainament.  I had their hefeweizen which is as good now as it was when it was quenching my jitterbug induced thirst.  And the fries are still good."}
{"text":"Having loved this place for years as is, they up and changed the menu.  The lower calorie menu is completely hacked to pieces and has only 4 items on it.  The Moroccan salmon and chicken were both gone.  As was my favorite sandwich, the Southwest Chicken, which started my love affair with this restaurant initially in the early 2000's.  But alas, the love affair is OVER!  This time I tried the Steak Frites (steak over their garlic fries).  The \"tangy\" sauce they advertise being put on the steak is freaking ketchup.  It was nasty.  The steak was cooked fine, but the ketchup ruined it.  And the fries were not done (and I think they forgot the garlic).  I was so disappointed.   This was our 2nd visit since the menu changed and our 2nd disappointment.  I have no reason to go back anymore."}
{"text":"Saturday night it wasn't that busy around 7 pm but it did get busier later. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were all great. They have a decent selection of different beers to try.  I had the shrimp tacos with a side kale salad. I can't believe it was healthy cuz it tasted quite good. My husband and I also shared wings. Those were okay.   It was nice that the bar was long and had lots of seats. If you are looking for a chill place for Sat night this would be it."}
{"text":"Yum! Great food, great ambiance, I would reccommend this place to anyone. I would like to come back for happy hour, I've heard good things."}
{"text":"Meh. I think the food is mediocre, but my wife likes it. Definitely better places around SanTan.  The service isn't the best either. It's also a little pricey for what you get. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"After the numerous times we've frequented this place for afterwork drinks, I think it's about time I left a review.  I may be a little biased because we've gotten to know the bartenders and some of the servers--I feel like I'm a part of \"Cheers\" walking in here! lol  I give it 5 stars mostly because it's everything you should expect from one of these bar/restaurants--bar food and booze.  Love the bartenders--Kala, Matt, Natalia and Billy--they're pretty awesome and always remember our usuals.  We're almost always at the bar, so I'm not sure what service is like at the tables, but I hear it's kind of so-so.    The beer is pretty good.  Not a huge selection, because they like to showcase their own craft beers.  I really enjoy the food.  My favorites have gotta be the fried artichokes, wedge salad with blue cheese, the veggie pizza, veggie tacos, fish tacos, and the garlic fries! MMM!  I'd say it's moderately priced.  I know they have a happy hour, too, so that's fun.  Overall, I'd say it's a great place to come in, grab a drink, eat and hang out with coworkers.  Plus they have televisions all around the bar, so they get bonus points for that! :)"}
{"text":"I feel like I could have purchased their food in the freezer section of my grocery store. Server was nice."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Gordon Biersh.  Upon arrival I thought the atmosphere was pleasant.  I was promptly greeted at the door and offered my choice of seating (Bar, cocktail lounge, dining area, or patio)  I chose to sit in the cocktail lounge and wait for my guest to arrive.  I was also quickly presented with a menu selection of dinner selections, craft brews, and wine.    That is the last time I will use the word quick in this review.  It took about 10 minutes for the server to come by and take my drink order.  She did bring a water when she took the drink order which I thought was nice but now realize that it is because it took forever for her to come back with my beer.  From the time I walked in the door to the time she brought my first beer was approx 20 minutes.  I would have understood if the Bar was hoping and they were busy, but there just wasn't anything going on that would justify the 20 minute wait.  After my guest arrived I warned her to order her drinks 10 minutes ahead of time and we were okay the rest of the evening.    The food was on par with the rest of the reviews.  I had the garlic fries, which were interesting and tasty.  She ordered asparagus and mushrooms and complained that they were a bit on the buttery side.  I was pleased with the atmosphere and the accommodations they even have a fireplace outside.  Unfortunately there is really only room enough for a small group around the fire and it was occupied.  I thought the place was pretty clean and kept up until I paid a visit to the restroom.  I can only guess as to how a public restroom in a nice establishment could be so trashed.  One of the Urinals was out of service with a trash bag over it followed by lot of littered paper towels on it.  there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor and sink counter.  It looked like a battle had taken place and I was looking at the fallout of TP war II.   Overall, I guess it is what you might expect from a chain attempting to pass as a unique establishment.  It really falls to the staff and management to fix the negatives that I point out.  The Beer and atmosphere were nice.  I would go again but it may not be my first choice."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!! I just had THE most flavorful dish ever!! I tried the \"DRUNKEN RIBEYE STEAK\" dinner with pickled red cabbage and bacon and saurkraut and cheese  crokettes., these are like hush puppies,.  It was suggested by my wonderful server, Jessica,  and I would have passed up a great taste experience without her enthusiastic recommdation."}
{"text":"First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.  Second: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.  Third: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.  Fourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.  Fifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.  Sixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.  Seventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant when we are in town. Great happy hour menu for a group of people who want to share a variety of dishes"}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive- about $9 each.  Vegetarian options are pathetic- salads that you have to specify to leave the meat off, pizza or appetizers and side dishes.  I opted for a house salad- lettuce, 2 kinds of cheese, nuts, cucumbers and dressing in a small bowl for $5.95.  And a side of potato wedges topped with gorgonzola.  Both were just okay.  Service was good.  It annoys me that restaurants on Mill Ave don't validate parking tickets from the garage anymore."}
{"text":"This location closes permanently  on October, 30 2015. The staff is friendly and the drinks are good."}
{"text":"Each time I eat here...I always look at the menu and end up having the same thing - the ceasar salad with salmon. Nothing else really interests me on the menu. The service is good - no complaints there. But its nothing special. But I will tel you this - there is nothing like a cold beer on a hot day!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Gordon Biersch on Mill for years and this was our first visit to this location.  The Mill location is a lot larger and a lot less crowded.  I think the ambiance and view of the Mill location is a bit better to my eye than this location.  Anyway, the service, food and beer is pretty much the same at both locations.  My wife is a member of their Stein Club thing and so we get invited to several events per year where we get some free food and beer.  After the event we normally stay for a bite to eat.  I'm really not a fan of their food but stay partly because I feel bad for drinking the free beer and partly because I am too lazy to get dinner somewhere else.  Last night there was an event featuring their Maibach beer.  I had a few of those and sampled some of their orange chicken and garlic edamame.  The Maibach was excellent but the food was just eh.  The orange chicken was slightly better quality than Panda Express and really not very good and very odd for a German beer place.  Actually, most of their menu is odd for a German beer place.  The garlic sauce stuff that they put on their garlic fries was the same thing they used for the edamame.  It was unique but really not very good.  I mean it is a slightly healthier option than the fries but is really just too oily/buttery to put over edamame."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  Great menu with lots of good items to choose from.  One of the favorites is the Lobster and Shrimp tacos you cannot go wrong with them.  Also Love the beer selection.  I enjoy the seasonal items that come out in addition to ones that are all year long."}
{"text":"If eating a rack of ribs from Ellis Island isn't enough to fill you up... drive down the road to Gordon Biersch for their Happy hour.    Kudos on the happy hour menu, we got the slider combo -6 sliders and garlic fries for $11? awesome!    after a few margaritas ($5 bucks each) this was an excellent place to watch Monday night football.... especially when Chargers kicked some BUTTs!  Go bolts!"}
{"text":"Both the salmon and chicken were overcooked, tough and chewy. Service was fine though."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. Last night we went in for dinner and the server was very nice but obviously put in all our food in at once. We ordered an appetizer and two starter salads which came AFTER the entrees hit the table. Being that we too are restaurant people, we chose not to have anything sent back or re-made to waste food. So with a table FULL of food the dressing on my salad was wrong.... Including realizing I didn't even get the correct entree. They remade the correct entree and brought it out in good timing. After not being able to enjoy most of the food due to having EVERYTHING AT ONCE... We ordered for my four year old daughter the dessert on the kids menu. I believe it was an Oreo cake of some sort... I wish I could post the video of how ROCK HARD this thing was.... I couldn't even penetrate it by raising my hand and stabbing it over and over. Who plates that and sends it out to a child? I sent that back and asked for the check. All of this without ONE manager visit... With as slow as it was having 8-10 tables in the restaurant one would assume you'd have time to table touch. So we paid the bill in full because no one cared to possibly try to do any kind of guest recovery. I am not saying it's a bad place or not to go but this experience was absolutely terrible and shameful with such a great named place. Again being in the industry myself I stayed and kept a smile on my face the whole time. Arco was our server and was very nice and tried to be apologetic  but unfortunately was crucial part of our negative experience. I'll go to another Gordon biersche again sometime just not the one in Summerlin. The jambalaya was delicious!"}
{"text":"Well, good thing this place has good food! The service was terrible and that's coming from a fellow server. I don't remember his name but he was non existent! He had a weird accent, maybe southern,  that I swear is fake, it came and went each time he came around, so all of 3 times. Our whole table of 5 had empty cups and finally the manager came by and ended up serving our table to rest of the time. Thank goodness for him. I had a mahi sandwich and it was super good. I wouldn't go back because of the service alone."}
{"text":"This really should be one of those places that is consistent and at least A-OK with comparable food that goes with the beer. However, oh boy was it not. I got the shrimp cobb salad, which was fine, but everybody else's food was absolutely cold. It was a terrible night for the kitchen and thankfully the restaurant and our server comped our meal and was super apologetic about everything. However, even with the good service and comping, the food still wasn't good with the exception of garlic fries. I really hope our experience was a fluke, but I will definitely not be going back there again."}
{"text":"I can't think of anyone thing that would really make me want to return to this particular Restaurant, maybe another location would be better but it will be awhile if anytime in the next year. We walked in and were sat promptly, The employees just seems to be just going through the motions not happy to see you you come in and sit down what can I get for you. First when you order drinks they should be delivered at the same time. I ordered the California burger with bacon, I received a small burger tasted ok not outstanding at all. The bun was burnt and burger patty was very small. There was support to be thousand island  dressing but I don't think there was even a half teaspoon between both buns and had to ask for mayonnaise just so I could swallow the burger.The fries were the best part of the meal. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled. My husband ordered the chicken and pasta dish he said it was so so not the best by far. The fact that we both walked right past the manager who never even acknowledged that we were in the restaurant was sad. I was not impressed at all.."}
{"text":"I spent an evening here with some coworkers drinking Marzens, Hefeweizens, seasonal etc....along with the infamous Garlic Fries.  The beer was cold and fresh. The waitress was always checking on us to make sure our glasses weren't empty. The service was prompt and  persistent. This girl earned her tip!!!  The Ambiance is your typical distillery look from the 1940s with the modern flair of neon signs and flat panel displays tuned to the current sport events.  The place was jumping with activity and the experience was good, I would certainly visit GB in LV again!  We drank like fish....I left this place a happy guy!"}
{"text":"Made a 5:15 reservation for my party of 10 for my parents 40th wedding anniversary, this would have given us just under 2 hours before the Coyotes game on 12/28. First part of the party shows up on time but they advise they won't seat us until entire party is here even though the section where we were eventually seated had multiple open tables. We were finally seated at about 5:30. They told us we would have 2 servers, ok great. So we wait for the servers and we wait and we wait. 20 minutes after being seated they finally arrive for our drink order, we place that as well as the order for appetizers. The servers brought the drinks fairly quickly and we ordered our dinner. Servers advised us the appetizers would be out shortly. We continued to wait. At 6:30 after being seated for an hour and being at the restaurant for over an hour we have no appetizers or food. At this point we're all hangry, we just tell the server to bring the bill for the drinks and cancel our order. Ridiculous! They at least comped our beers but very disappointed. I have been to other locations and this has never happened. Needless to say we won't be back. My parents enjoyed popcorn and pretzels at the coyotes game for their anniversary dinner. I would have given 0 stars but it wouldn't let me."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick snack around 12 noon on a Saturday. Awesome location on Mill and super cool views from the upstairs and balconies. If it was warmer we would have sat outside.   Good service, good beers, and Southwest Spring Rolls. That's a 4 star experience anyday"}
{"text":"I am sorry I recommended this restaurant at lunch for my boss and me.  We both had the seafood salad with shrimp and crab.  The 4 shrimp I got were the tiny salad shrimp.  They were dried out, some had no meat inside only outside skin.  The \"crab\" was obviously from a can and very gray.  Both salads were not fit to eat.  Disgusting!  The entire salad was covered with imitation bacon (Bacos).  I am aware of the glowing reviews for Gordon Biersch; however, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone because a salad is one of the simplest and easiest meals to prepare."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch was a very respectable all-around meal with beer (!!!).  I had a Bison burger, well-seasoned on a nice bed of caramelized onions, served with garlic fries.  The fries were awesome, fries tossed in sauteed garlic with chopped parsley - yummy yummy.  The pizza was good too, it had a decent crust with a nice flavor of oregano. Dinner was matched with a generous mug of dark Winterfest beer, also quite enjoyable.  For dessert we had a slice of pumpkin cheese cake with cream cheese icing and bourbon honey sauce.   All around a great meal. I would have given 4 stars if I was able to try more of the dishes.  Comparing to Kona Grill down the street:  I think the menu at Kona looks nicer, but I am always disappointed with the results.  Here at Gordon Biersch, I was delighted with everything that was set down before us!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with our 3 friends and were immediately greeted with our server David to make sure we were seated at a table since we had a baby with us. Since it was our first time here he made plenty of suggestions and had us laughing during our entire meal! Will definitely be back delicious food and impeccable service!"}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS & the music is GREAT! Such a good vibe every visit! If you haven't gone' you're definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Wasn't expecting the food that I had. You know, the meal where you say, I could come back here for dinner. Priced very well and the portions are great too! Must say, if you are looking for options with a nice brew, hit this one up; you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Me, my dad and aunt stopped here for dinner before going to a show at the Palms. I ordered an Oktoberfest beer and a burger and some fries. The burger was delicious and the Oktoberfest was so good that I almost finished all of it. My dad also owns a sealing company here in Vegas for breweries, so we've done business with them on several occasions. :)"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this Gordon Biersch is permanently closed as of November 2015. Apparently they weren't getting enough business. What a shame. They had awesome happy hours and delicious appetizers Good location, awesome people,  an outdoor eating area, warm ambience.  Guess it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"The second floor view was nice, staff were very attentive and kind, the manager came by and checked on us which we nice, the food was great.  They even gave us free samples of beer and coupons to come back! I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area :)"}
{"text":"This was a good all around experience. I ordered the tuscan chicken pasta, which turned out to be very good. Service was friendly, prices reasonable, and there were plenty of items on the menu that make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I ended up in Tempe when I couldn't fathom batteling the crowds at the Zoo lights.  I really had to go to the bathroom after parking in the area so I decided to stop in to Gordon for a beer and a wee.   The food smelled delicious but when I looked at the menu I wasn't impressed at all. Too pricey and not so interesting.  However, the beers were yummy! If I end up here again it will only be for the beer."}
{"text":"We went here other day and service was just too slow during lunch time. Calamari and chicken wings were just ok. Maybe I should have tried something else."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with he spouse on a Tuesday afternoon. We didn't try the food so can't speak on that. It was gorgeous out so asked to sit on the patio. Short wait for that. We definitely enjoyed people watching from the upstairs patio on Mill.  The beer was good. Between us we tried the Pilsner, Marzen and Maibock. The latter two hit the spot for me, even if the Maibock was a bit sweet. It was exactly what I needed then. What I loved was the 21oz servings of the beer and since we went on Tuesday at happy hour, each set us just $2.50! I gotta say, this alone will be bringing us beer drinkers back for more and we'll definitely be trying the food next time! There was a regular running group meeting there as well so I am looking forward to checking that out."}
{"text":"I love to come down here with friends for beer. Their house beer is fantastic, music is low enough for you to enjoy and engage in conversation without yelling.  I wish they were open later than 12:00am."}
{"text":"We come here fairly often. Sometimes the TV & music are battling each other and on one occassion we actually left. Food is good, great selection of beer, good kids menu as well."}
{"text":"It's very hard for me to enjoy a house brewed schwarzbier that, to me, tastes more like Bud Light with a hint of acrid smoke flavor than what I consider to be true schwarzbier. That was the one and only thing I truly didn't enjoy about the items I consumed during my visit to the 'Biersch.  The shrimp and lobster tacos were the closest to seafood heaven I've come to this far inland and in a chain joint. Fresh lobster and shrimp tossed around in some amazing cream sauce and then put between a hard shell, it was REALLY REALLY good. The rice and beans my meal came with were pretty bland, but I don't care. My fanaticism about my tacos probably comes from the price to quality ratio; you see, I'd have paid much more for these tacos in a nicer restaurant and they still probably wouldn't have been as good. The garlic fries we shared as an appetizer were good, but some of them were overcooked and others were soggy.  Our server was trying a little to hard, to the point that he was becoming more of an annoyance then a real help. We'll forgive him, he still did a decent job."}
{"text":"I definitely had my expectations of this place set WAY TOO HIGH.  I came here with a group of friends on a Sunday Brunch. There wasn't much of a wait for it being around 2 in the afternoon. Had a good group of people with us, and as i walk up to the hostess counter and tell her our number of people in our party, all i got was the \"really, that many\" sort of look. The roll of the eyes, the walk away unhappily before staring up and down at our entire groups' clothes, was not in the least pleasant. I'd say the two hostesses were quite rude if you ask me. It's your first priority to make the customers feel welcome the moment they walk in the door, we definitely should have left after the initial greeting, we had no idea it would be the initial horrible experience we should have foreseen at the beginning.  Our large group got the nice little back room to our selves. pretty open, quiet and enough seating for all of us and it was away from the jazz band playing during the Sunday Brunch.  It definitely felt like the restaurant was going for an older scene with the jazz band. Definitely no place for the 20 somethings that we were, walking in our pajamas and sweats after a long night of partying.  Just a bit annoying that when the door to our room was initially closed, they kept opening the door.  So maybe the 9 out of 11 of us, actually order food. Food was overall very good, decent amount of time taken to actually get our drinks, take our order, get our food and then finally get our check. So for prompt service, for the most part, i'll give you guys that. But one of my friends ordered a tomato juice. just regular plain tomato juice.  A few of us got alcoholic beverages, and got them as soon as we got our waters. but 20 minutes later, we get the tomato juice? seriously? were you guys opening up another can of tomato juice that was in the cellar down stairs, that was behind all the cartons of orange juice and milk?  The Bloody Mary I ordered had tomato juice.... couldn't get the tomato juice from the bar?  I don't know if it was just our server, but she didn't seem all quite there... So here's where I absolutely could not stand the rest of our experience.  yes, we know big groups you have to add gratuity, i get it. and thankfully that's all we gave our server for the experience.  I've worked in a restaurant and know how things work. 2 things on our bill were never accounted for. So another friend ordered a side of fruit, which we never got. So while splitting up the check i kindly asked if we can get it. first the server suggests she take it off but i said can we just get it instead. the server then suggests do you want it to-go. I agreed thinking i'd get the side of fruit in a small to go cup, and what does she walk back with.... a side of fruit in a regular bowl. so I don't get how she was the one who initiated the food to-go and we didn't even get it.... Then on top of that, while paying the bill equally among cash and credit cards, I wrote down how much should be paid on each card. wrote down amount, last name that belonged to the card, and the last 4 of the card. Pretty simplified, easy to read. One of my friends should have only had no more than $10 charged on her card. instead while preparing to sign it, she's like am i reading this right, $60?  and when i go tell our server, she said her manager was the one who charged the different cards. so you're telling me a manager doesn't know what he's doing????? Just because we're a bunch of young people who like to party cuz it's VEGAS doesn't mean you can try to take advantage of us.   WOW.  Rude Hostesses, Dimwitted Servers, and Uneducated Managers?   thanks, but no thanks. never will return to this location.  sorry."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 is a) I want it to stay in business (which can be hard on Mill these days!) and b) It's one of the few places on Mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled. ;) lol Now, I definately enjoy a night out without the babes too, but this is a place I go for happy hour with my husband and daughter. The beer/wine is good, the food is good (I like the southwestern egg roll apps), the price is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is nice (thought I was going to say good, huh?). We love to sit on the patio and people watch."}
{"text":"Very average to poor service.  Food was just ok. Nothing great.  My black and blue burger was over cooked.   The server was horrible. When we asked for ketchup or more ice for our tea it took him for ever to get it.  All servers just stood back behind the kitchen and chatted a lot."}
{"text":"It's prime patio season here in The Valley of the Sun which means it's time to head outdoors for lunch. This location is in the busy shopping center at West Gate in Glendale, AZ. Today there happened to be a Coyotes hockey game here at the arena so service was a little slow. Friendly and accommodating but slow.   We were seated and greeted promptly and our drinks were brought out fairly quick. Our food took a long time to reach us however.   My husband & boys age 11 & 12 ordered custom grilled burgers. I ordered \"smoked\" chicken Tostadas which turned out to be grilled chicken with smoke seasoning in lettuce wraps. I was happy with the lettuce instead of corn tortillas but disappointed in the over grilled, not smoked chicken. They proved to be pretty tasty otherwise especially with the pickled red onions, yum!!  The hamburgers were huge on fresh, grilled, buttered buns and came with advertised \"endless fries\" either garlic or salt and pepper. They were thick cut and delicious but we ran out of the small side serving quickly and waited over 20 minutes for another batch to arrive by which time we were over it.   Bottom line?  Great quality food and beer, nice patio, very friendly customer service, much too long of a wait for food!! Would I come again? Probably not to this location on a weekend."}
{"text":"Anyone know why they closed??? We loved sitting on the patio! Especially this time of year. So bummed!!"}
{"text":"So impressed! I came here with 2 of my friends for lunch and I was really pleased with my experience here. The atmosphere is casual and laidback. Our server was Lani and he was great! Lani was extremely hospitable and sincere; he always made sure our drinks were filled, made all the right suggestions regarding our orders, he'd constantly checked up on us, and had outstanding customer appreciation. During our meal, Lani brought out samples of a sweet beer for my friends and I to try and I absolutely loved it. I'm not a huge beer drinker, nor do I like sweet drinks, BUT this particular brew was really on point. I ordered the calamari and the grilled ahi tuna (no butter) with brown rice and veggies and it was delicious! I highly recommend going here!...I cannot wait to come back here to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Bomb slider Brats! Kobe beef sliders with the Brie was to die for. Some of the best garlic fries we have ever had. Chocolate Budino cake actually taste like a soufflé. It was HEAVENLY.  When we got there, the little Asian hostess had a rotten attitude. She was really rude and actually rolled our eyes when we told her we had 7 people. I'm assuming it's because we took her away from cleaning her menus. Wait staff did a really good job making up for it."}
{"text":"Never been to this place before.  My first impression was not a good one.  The hostess was on the phone, a personal call, acknowledged us about 5 min. later.  Our waiter was ok.  You could tell he didn't wanna be there on a Sat. night.    The only reason we went here was b/c we had some gift cards.  Food is decent, nothing to brag about.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Love the experience here, the garlic fries are amazing! The location is also great if you are downtown Tempe. If you sit along the windows or outside the view is good since it is on the second floor. The service was a bit slow, but it worked for us since we were there for a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"In my few trips to Tempe, I've found myself here more than once.  In fact at least once a trip.   I'm just not sure why.   The first time I found myself in Arizona, this place seemed like an Oasis in the desert.  It wasn't super pricey, they brewed their own beer (my biggest weakness), and the food was not your typical menu.  The second time, they were out of their summer seasonal which began their downfall.    The menu is fairly run of the mill and a little overpriced for the portions you receive.  The food is bland and not exciting at all, except for the garlic fries (which have so much garlic on them that you can't enjoy them).   That said, the atmosphere is nice.  The light sconces are make of barley and beers (kitschy but cute anyway).   And the service is good.  The other day, my sister and I had a good time with our waiter.  When we heard him say \"wooder\" we asked if he was from NY or NJ (northern, clearly he was a Giants fan) and got \"Oh, NEW YORK!\" as a response.  Then we discussed south Jersey shore towns.       One thing I've noticed is that their hosts always have a little bit of trouble getting their act together.  I know there are two room and outdoor seating, but come on..."}
{"text":"Hate this stupid place!!! The manager is rude! Their food is ok. The waiter was decent, but not attentive. I would not go back here again. We tried to celebrate our friends birthday and only got shut down for being loud and fun. This is definitely not the place to come to when you want to party and eat with you friends!"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in for some yummy seasonal brew.. Tried Festbier.... Extremely unimpressed. The flavor has nothing seasonal about it. Ended up with the Hefeweizen that was thoroughly enjoyable. The hint of clove was exactly what I was looking for. Service is mrrrhhh, energy is mrrrrhhh, even for a Friday night. The garlic fries aren't everything they're cracked up to be. Garlic on fries. Whoopie."}
{"text":"Went with our best friends.  He suggested the Shrimp and Lobster Tacos.  AWESOME! Will try again. My mojito was not the best but my husband loved his beer. Great place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"My parents really like this place, so I end up here more often than I like (one time would have been enough for me). It is not bad...but I don't see what all the fuss is about either.  I'm going to break my own (self-imposed) rule of not mentioning other business names in reviews. I'm doing this because it will be useful if you've never been here before. Using a scale of chain restaurants to compare, Gordon Biersch is a little better than Chili's and not quite as good as The Cheescake Factory. Think of it like \"Applebee's Deluxe.\" There, I said it. The ambiance and prices lead you to believe you're getting more than an Applebee's experience...but you are not.  I've tried many different menu items and beers here...none of it was phenomenal. None of it was bad either. You could do worse. Just don't expect too much.  Oh, one little point of contention. There are discounts on their beers during happy hour...but not if you're sitting a few feet away in the dining section -- only in the bar section. Really?! Seemed lame to me, so one time I canceled my request for a beer and just drank water out of spite. And another time I didn't order a drink with the server, and as soon as she walked away I got up and ordered my own beer at the bar. I don't mind walking a few feet to save a few bucks. I still think it's idiotic that I have to...but that's corporate (mis-)management for you."}
{"text":"The grass fed beef sliders are amazing! Very tasty! Service on the outdoor patio was great!!"}
{"text":"Let's just start this with how friendly their staff was. Drinks were also pretty delicious. The food however was just a little lackluster. Two of us got the pan seared lemon salmon and another one of us got the tacos. The salmon was pretty dry along with the garlic mash. The asparagus I got was dry and kind of burnt. The tacos were pretty good from what I tasted. Overall decent.."}
{"text":"Food is good but a little inconsistent between visits. Service is slow and inattentive. Two different visits, two different servers, the service was slow both times. The restaurant was quiet and slow during both visits. No reason to let ice tea and waters go dry."}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions and I've found their food overall very lack-luster. The descriptions sound amazing and makes my taste bud tingle, however when I finally receive my plate of food I'm very underwhelmed. The multiple dishes that I've tried are very bland and overall lack seasoning.  It's a good place to hang out with friends, grab a couple beers, and maybe share some appetizers. But if I wanted to do that, I'd go someplace with better food. Yard House does a better job."}
{"text":"My Dad and I came for a late lunch after a Cubs game. The server was very funny and knowledgeable... He was spot-on with the beer selections. My dad got the Marzen and I got the HEF...banana and clove, yup...Thnx server guy, sorry I forget ur name.   The food was Okay...But the Garlic fries are AWESOME ! ! ! at least with a Beer they are...  I got the Beef Dip and my Dad got a Club sandwich...Good but it's not like they're reinventing the wheel with these two classics...  BEER BEER BEER ! BEER BEER BEER ! BEER BEER BEER !"}
{"text":"I had the burshetta chicken and it was amazing! Very light, the flavor was great and it was filling. Also had the hef beer, it was very good, would take a growler home if the calories weren't so high. Great service, ate outside, tables were a little close together, could hear every word of the table next to us, but always a nice experience at this location."}
{"text":"Disappointing?   Me and some friends decided to give this place a try since we hadn't eaten all day and were STARVING   we sat in the bar area.... We must of been invisible because it took a good 20min before someone came and gave us menus  and then about another 20 for them to come back and get our orders   I don't eat much so I ordered house salad and the steak kabob appetizer my other friend ordered a hamburger fries and a Ceasar salad and my other friend ordered steak mashed potatoes and a salad as well   You can't really mess up a salad so those were fine .... While waiting for our main courses the bartender was basically screaming behind us we could barely have our own convo   Finally course my kabob was fine no complaints my friends hamburger completely not cooked right  but we don't like to complain and we were so hungry he ate is anyways my friends steak was cooked fine but there was more fat then meat smh   We had asked for our checks separated and the waitress snatched it back and made the most ugliest face all of us were like wow she must hate her job?   I don't know if I would return maybe for some drinks or if I'm dieing of hunger but .... I wasn't impressed the least"}
{"text":"All four of us ordered different items from the dinner menu. The consensus was that each was excellent. Five star times four equals twenty stars. Most impressive. The server, Daniel, was highly attentive, cheerful and helpful.  If you're in the mood for a casual, moderately upscale experience of great fare with friends, this is a place you need to check out.  We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but something's missing.   It's like going on a date with someone good looking, but totally lacking in personality.  I feel as if I should like GB, but there's just no spark between us.  I don't know if it's the decent but overly cautious / lackluster beers, the food that is just slightly over-priced or the chronically cold and stiff corporate service.  As much as I LOVE craft beer and bar food, I just havent made a love connection here."}
{"text":"I only came for the Marzen and Hefeweizen. These are my favorites of this brewer. I remember when the San Francisco location opened in the 90's.   Since this is a Palo Alto, CA California Baby born business, I thought I would throw a few pennies their way.   I came, I drank, I got  a beer buzz and I left."}
{"text":"El ambiente y el servicio muy buenos y rapidos, la cerveza y los tragos adecuados, la comida regular, postres deliciosos, muy comodo para grupos, lo mas destacable es su carta de cervezas. El servicio es agilizado; fuimos un grupo de casi 20 personas y en ningun momento nos quedamos sin ser atendidos."}
{"text":"Love going here for dinner. Great brews and perfect atmosphere. The Kobe burger is a few dollars more but is well worth it. The workers here are very nice and the food usually comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"It's part of a chain, but they brew on site.  The food was fine - enjoyed the fish tacos.  Service was good.  Got the taster set and the best was the Mai Bock (last year's seasonal) so enjoyed that.  We also hit the A1A Brewery (part of same chain) in St. Augustine and it's good too."}
{"text":"We returned a few days later, and I am happy to say that our great experience the first time was not just a one time thing.  The food, brew, and service was just as awesome a second time!  Will plan to hit Gordon Biersch whenever I am back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"its a typical 3.5-star restaurant. Nothing special - even their famous beer is not that great anymore.   It doesnt mean their quality has fallen - today, we have a lot of restaurants/bar serving all kinds of beer from around the world. This makes G&B not so special anymore (it was 10 years ago).  However, if you like watching basketball and football games, this is a place to go. They even have happy hours - you get $1 discount on all beers! Only a dollar but it counts.   Other happy hour meals were like 5, 6, 7 dollars and they seem to be ok. I didnt order any of them - I dont order food based on the price. You live only once. Eat what you wanna eat. Then maybe you will get heart attack and die happily. Yes, food here is very greasy."}
{"text":"I came in with a friend and sat at the bar. The bartender greeted us immediately and handed us two menus. We had planned on ordering food and drinks but the menus she handed us were torn and dirty. We each ordered a drink but decided to go else where for dinner. It is one thing to have menus that are a little worn but seeing the food coated on them turned our stomachs and we could not find it in ourselves to stay and order."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant but my wife had heard great things. My food was good and the menu had a variety of options which all looked worth trying. However I was more happy about the quality Europe style beers, specifically for me the great Czech Pilsner which is hard to come by in the states.   I will be going back."}
{"text":"Hats off to the whole Gordon Biersch - Glendale, AZ team. We had an amazing group outing thanks to the staff who offered amazing service and couldn't have been more accommodating. The private room was fantastic for our whole team who couldn't have been in better hands. Service was prompt and spot on. A huge thank you to Kenny for coordinating our event and our ever changing guest count and his amazing team- They made our night!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Gordon Biersch either for lunch or dinner. Service is always friendly and they have a wide variety of \"new\" american pub food. Beer is also very good and they have great prices during happy hour. This is also a great place for a business lunch becuase you can be in and out in about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"The beer is good and the food is ok. The hamburger are ok, they have bigger portions than other places. If you like beer try this place."}
{"text":"I have been to Gordon Biersch 3 times now. I have had their sliders, garlic fries, south western eggs rolls, lobster bisque, and tapas. I will say the only thing I was not a fan of was the lobster bisque. I am very particular when it comes to soups and I like soups that are chunky, not ones that are just broth or soups that have been pureed. The lobster bisque had no chunks of lobster and no lobster flavor. So tell me why they call it lobster bisque? I dunno. Anyways, this is kinda like an Applebees or Chilis but a little more upscale and trendier. Same kinda food though, american bar food. So I wouldn't come here and order some kind of fancy pasta, seafood and probably wouldn't order a steak. But the apps, sammiches, and drinks are pretty tasty. Oh yeah, drinks. I have had a beer flight and it was ok. I'm not a big beer drinker. If you are though, the beer flight is a fantastic option to figure out what their best brew is. One drink I am a fan of from Gordon Biersch is the pomegranite mojito. I could drink 10 of these things and not think twice till after I am hugging the porcelain goddess. Haha. They are really fruity and smooth. Great girly drink! Go here is you are looking for a good happy hour or after work location to have a few drinks and bites with friends   :)"}
{"text":"8 of us went tonight and the service was terrible. I ordered the rib eye and it had so much fat on it that by the time I cut it off, the steak was half the size. It was about as thick as one that I'd get at Sizzler. Instead of 2 sides, I asked for a side salad at an additional $2.00 and for my second side, asparagus. On the salad, I asked for no tomatoes, no croutons, they brought the salad out with both. The asparagus was never brought out. The Kobe beef burger, which was ordered with a side of garlic fries, was given to us with a total of 13 oily, cold fries. When I was paying for the $208.00 meal, I let the waiter know I did not get the asparagus, she brought it out after I gave her the credit card to pay. She said \"here is your asparagus\". Btw, she did not reduce the charge of the salad to be a regular side even though I didn't get the second side. Not once did the manager come by to see how we were doing, even though he passed us multiple times. I am sad the meal and service was so bad because I have always liked GB."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 other locations of theirs, and the beers here are good; Kolsch, Irish Stout, and IPL.  Side note: L = Lager.  I honestly would avoid the hastle of brewing this in lager style, and stick with ale.... I would not order another IPL again.  Onto the food. I ordered a Kobe Cheeseburger, and it was good until I got to the paper wrapper 1/4 thru the burger.  Not really a big deal, but was kinda disgusting.  The server laugher about it and said she would tell the manager about it.  I said okay, but a beer would make it even.  When she came back, she brought me a card for a free dessert (expires in a month)...really, I'm visiting from SoCal and I'm leaving tomorrow (Sunday).  Dissapointed with the service !  PS: Was in event room... and server constantly kept letting us know that we haven't met the minimum $$$ yet... really ?!!?"}
{"text":"Went here last night, and really enjoyed the beer sampler.  A deal for $5.    The salmon ceaser and the potstickers were good as well.  I'm a big fan of quick service, and our waiter did a great job.  We sat in the bar area, and the vibe was busy, but not to the point where it was too much.  I used to have my reservations because the one in Hawaii was 3 stars at best, but I have to say they're doing it right here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had cheese curds and garlic fries for an appetizer. Both were delicious. I had the French Dip Sliders and a Chocolate Stout for the main course and they were good too.  Huge menu with lots of options. Will be back to try some more."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another shot this evening after the awful experience I had 9 months ago I thought I would give this place another opportunity. I was immediately greeted by the hostess as soon as I came in this evening as I headed to the bar. The venue was not crowded with a steady flow of customers that could easily be managed. The two minute bar rule was a total wash this round because I was finally approached by the bartender five minutes later. He was extremely friendly and quick to make me a drink. I ordered the house Rootbeer which was not anything special to sip on but I accepted the drink anyways. I started with an appetizer that came out quickly and tasted well but my main entree was wrong. Since I am not a fan of sending food back I decided to slide my plate over to a friend who met up with me to munch on. Instead of placing a completely different order I decided not to eat at all. I realize I am just not a fan of this place. My last experience was the worst Resturant experience I have ever encountered I guess I can't let it go.   I gave this establishment one more star for being clean and really trying hard to get things right.   Some friendly suggestions to make this work in the future. The manager walked the venue but never checked in or said hello to the guest. That was odd. As slow as it was I feel the manager should have checked on the tables. Two if the food is wrong and you clearly noticed the order is messed up FIX IT."}
{"text":"Family in town from the midwest - looking for a little variety of different foods and of course - beer! What a great choice . . from steak to chicken medallions to burgers to mauhi mauhi or and don't forget the garlic fries and mash potatoes.  Price - a little pricey Service - great Atmosphere - relaxing and upbeat (bar and flat screens for the sports fans)  Definately will go back"}
{"text":"My bf and I like to go here for happy hours after 9pm. Appetizers range from  $5 to $7. I love their bbq chicken/vege pizza and their garlic fries!! I believe beer are only $3. The place is quiet after 9pm at the bar so it always a nice place for us to relax and chit chat."}
{"text":"Meh.  Chain brewery/pub/restaurant that always seems to produce reliable mediocrity.  I end up here when others want to go, but never by choice.  This time I figured I'd try the fish and chips, since you can't screw up something so simple (or so I thought).  Well, it was the blandest fish ever, plus overcooked until it was hard and chewy.  The fries were wet, soggy, and limp.  Barely edible overall, and certainly not anything like you'd expect from a place that promotes itself as an upscale pub.  Don't bother; any random neighborhood bar is a better gamble than this known mediocrity."}
{"text":"Awful service. They were understaffed on GAME DAY and we had to wait 45 minutes for a measly table....hostess said she would call but never did, when we returned there were people showing up and getting a table immediately. They pretty much forgot about the entire list of people they had put down for reservations. There are definitely better places to go."}
{"text":"January 2011  Don't get me wrong, I love Gordon Biersch . . . their happy hour is pretty awesome, but my last  visit to this particular establishment sucked !  Pros- * awesome happy hour menu w/ cheap eats * good selection of brews (including GB home brews) * chill atmosphere with outdoor patio area  Cons- * bad service * slow service * would not accommodate our seating request * No reservations at bar. Not even for large groups!  Tips- * if you go with a large group of people, make sure to bring cash * happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area.  Sit at the bar itself for quicker service (not the surrounding tables in the bar area). * the patio is part of the bar area.  Make sure to take advantage of it.  * heat lamps are available on those colder Nevada nights. * Summerlin GBs has way better service (I'm just saying) !  Overall- I love GBs , but I don't think I'll be returning to this particular location.  The server was horrible and it was evident that she was having a bad day.  She did not smile and was frustrated the whole time because we had a larger party.  We tried to get seating near the bar for those that were under age in our party.  The server explained that it was \"closed\" and that if they wanted to join us, we'd all have to move to the dining area.  She was not helpful at all and did not even make the effort to help us.  The food was good as always and my company was great so I had a good time.  It's a disappointment that the service was subpar."}
{"text":"I come here on and off for business lunches, or when traveling to other cities to get a beer (i.e. tempe, DC).  The beer is always good, but the food and service are hit or miss.  For instance, I have had to wait on some occasions for food after ordered for 30-40 min. or more at lunch for simple sandwiches or burgers several times (with surly excuses from waitstaff at times in response to questions on the delays), other times they come out in 5-10 minutes.  Some food has been pretty good (cobb salad, bulgogi tacos), other really unremarkable or poor (i.e. red beans and rice).  Just a hit or miss place for food and service.  Menu generally can be interesting, but you never know what you are going to get for food or service."}
{"text":"Went there after a not-so-good experience at a local tap room and it was great. I had a great burger (Classic with jalapenos) and a Jamey and Ginger. Service (hostess and server) and food were both fantastic."}
{"text":"The main reason I frequent this place is for the fresh Lager Beer and Ahi Taco's. Of course half the time they serve me Mahi ... not Ahi. (Must not translate well to Spanish)  Ok Total Wine & More and the Apple store is on the same block and their Happy Hour starts early at 9PM which also get me in the door.  Decent energy in the bar area for an East Valley location."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  Well, it's centrally located, it's a bit pricey and they have one good beer on tap.  I was really into GB before their old brewer left them and used to roll there between classes for college fuel... They had a killin beer called the Dunkles, but it's existence is no more at the Tempe Location.  I like the Marzen quite a bit as well.  The food is good, but I believe it's priced about $3 more than it's worth, and for brewing their own beer, they charge more than any other bar on mill.  This is unacceptable since: A. Their beer is just good... not 4 peaks mouth watering. B. They only have 4 beers on tap. C. They brew it, and anyone who's worked at a brewery knows that beer costs in the range of $.25-$.75 a pint to make.  This place is also inconsistent.  I don't know how many times I've sent back my garlic fries appetizer because they were cold, soggy and undercooked.  Many times, they threw the same fries back into the fryer and brought them back overcooked.  I have had many a free meal due to reasons like this or server incompetence.   I have also run into a few bartenders there that have bad attitudes, and I do believe that the staff their has a pole shoved up their collective asses... except for the dude that served me yesterday. He was cool and an artist, but this is an exception and not a rule.  I really want this place to be more, but it's a corporate eatery that brews it's own beer and that's it.  There's nothing special about it at all.  In fact, it attempts to be cooler than it is, and I believe it's operating under an antiquated business model that was concocted before Micro Brews flooded the market.    The place believes it has something special to offer, but with over priced mid grade beers, why not just go to four peaks, or a bar with a hip tap like papago?   They are cocky about the fact that they brew beer and spew out factoids about how Dan Biersch went to the renowned Weinstephaner brewing school in Germany.  Well I got news, Dan Biersch probably hasn't even stepped foot in the Tempe location and has no hand in their brewing practice other than the recipe he emailed to the brewmaster, so I don't give a rats ass about him.   Go here if you want to hit up a Crapple B', Chili's, TGIF spot, because it is better.    If you want a personal belly warming beer experience... go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So my friends wanted to come here. Well we sit at the bar, and we aren't acknowledged for at least 20 minutes. The bartender finally looks at us, says hi and walks away to go talk to someone else. Fine. He finally acknowledges us and only takes one if our orders. Well there's 3 of us. Another bartender took our order much later l, after my friend had already gotten her beer. Well, we order food. My friend orders the southwest egg rolls. I ordered the artichoke dip and our other friend orders the cheese pizza. 30 more minutes and the egg rolls come out. Those were delicious, but where's the rest? 20 more minutes and our food finally comes out. They bring him out a Tostitos gas station microwave pizza. He said.it was horrible. My artichoke dip finally comes out. It looks great. I take one bite and I couldn't even swallow it. It tasted like the smell of an infected pussy. So I sent it back and, not only did they not apologize, but they didn't offer any sort of rectification. I'm extremely disappointed. Not only will I never come back, but I'll make sure no one I know ever comes to this poor excuse of an establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Food was VERY over priced and honestly just ok. I was not impressed and probably would not return. Service was good though."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots. They have great southwest egg rolls! DA BOMB! food comes out hot, fresh, and tasty. price is as expected! comparable with any other casual sit down restaurant. check them out if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but very good food and beer.  Go there during happy hour and the prices are much more reasonable.  Excellent burgers and the lobster pasta is also very good."}
{"text":"Brought a group of 15 here and had a terrible experience.  Slow and bad service.. Below average food.We actually had to serve ourselves dessert because we got tired of waiting.   When we mentioned our poor experience to the manager he apologized but Did zero to make the matter better. And he mentioned a \"regional manager\" was there and she was aware of the issues.  But she was too much of a coward to come back and say anything.   I would never consider bringing a large group here again or coming here with a small group either for that matter. I can't do anything to save my night all I can do at this point is to warn other people. This place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"This is a 2 story Gordon Biersch with outdoor seating on the 2nd floor balcony.  So that's where I sat for lunch.  Not a really exciting view, but it was nice out. I love the garlic fries there (Gordon Biersch in general)!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour @ Gordon Biersh is just OK.  I love the patio and the fire pit, very nice.  However the HH menu is not that happy.  5$ southwest egg rolls and 1$ off draft beers.  The food is just ok.  The beer is good.  The value is lacking.   Probably would avoid HH at Gordon Biersh."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch Brewing is a great place in Tempe if you looking for good food and beer! Garlic fries and burger is great call and they have really good outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Can I have some more please?  This place was so good and so chill to just hangout in too.   I thought it was pretty funny because there was a huge line of people waiting and they were even giving out buzzers, but I just went straight to the hostess, asked for a table for 4 and they sat us immediately. i seriously think I must've jacked someone's place.   I guess the happy hour was only for the bar and patio, BUT since we asked our waiter about it, he secretly slipped us the happy hour menu. He told us to keep that a secret, so I'm not naming names. That guy was funny though. He did it all stealth status by telling my bf to open his big menu and slipping the small happy hour menu inside of that one.   There were 3 of us and we weren't starving or anything, so we just decided to share the slider combo and calamari. 11 bucks for the combo and 7 bucks for the calamari. Oh how I love happy hour deals!  The calamari came out with marinara sauce. Mmm, like sex in my mouth, it was so good! I always love finding places with good calamari.   The sliders and garlic fries were sexy! It was perfect because it came with 2 different sliders, 3 of each kind and there were 3 of us. So we each got 2 sliders and shared the garlic fries which was so garlicky delicious!  As we were finishing up our sliders, some other waitress came up and said \"want some edamame?\" I'm so happy we said yes because that was a serious garlic sex explosion in my mouth. OMG. I have never had garlic edamame! This is something I'll be sure to get everytime I come back because it was just soo tasty! Unfortunately they charged us for it which we didn't expect since she randomly dropped it off. We were under the impression they got the wrong order for another table and offered it to us for free. It's all good though because it was just to die for!  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our birthday dinner here during their late night happy hour. We had a group of about 20 people that were all seated within the same corner of the bar area. We were stressing out beforehand because we knew it was first come first serve and we were expecting close to 30 people that would all show up at different times. Luckily the bar area wasn't very busy that night, so we were all able to sit in the same area.   Me and my bf ordered our food and drinks once we got there and closed our bill immediately because we didn't want to go thru the whole craziness of huge group bill. Good thing we did that, because when more people started arriving, the waitress told them all that she couldn't split any bills because \"it would just be too hard.\"   I shared the calamari ($7) and slider combo ($11) with my boyfriend. We substituted the pulled pork sliders for kobe since my bf said the pulled pork was too oily and saucy last time he came, so we got garlic fries and 6 kobe sliders. I only had a couple pieces of fries. They were pretty good and very garlicky, but I didn't want dragon breath as I was hosting the dinner. The sliders were mediocre, nothing special. I ate about two and got bored. The calamari was good. I always like it when my calamari comes with marinara. I wish the menu would've mentioned  the other sauce having horse radish though. I hate horseradish!  A couple of my friends ordered me drinks. I was given a raspberry ice pick, which was nice and refreshing and a Long Island Iced Tea, which I only drank about a fourth of and gave the rest to my brother because I felt like it was going to make me pass out on the floor.    All in all, mediocre food (at least during happy hour), mediocre service, good drinks, and a good place for groups. 3 stars for you!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday. The place was rather slow for a Sunday night. Despite this, the service was awful and slow! They messed up my daughter's order not once but twice! Will never go there again..."}
{"text":"I made a reservation only to be told it will be a 15-20 minute wait unless we were to sit in the bar area. We sat for about 15 minutes until I got up to get us menus from the bar and an addition 15 minute wait for anyone to come over to us. I was SHOCKED at how expensive everything was and how small everything came out. I got a Strawberry Soda and was warned that it was \"very sweet.\" It wasn't sweet. It was sugar free. That drink was $9.00 and it was small as hell. We got the artichoke dip...it was sour cream and lemon with chunks of artichoke. It was such a let down. There's only one thing they got right: my beer. That came out of a glass. Not their brewery."}
{"text":"Yesterday was really good - the fish and chips were crispy and tasted delicious.  Beer was cold and service was great."}
{"text":"I've only been here 2 or 3 times, and have had a great experince every time! From the really nice hostesses, super attentive server, to the manager coming by asking how everything was I felt like the staff were happy to be there which is refreshing! The food was amazing everytime, I like how wide of variety the menu has so whatever you're craving they have it, the potstickers are so delicious! All of the burgers are delicious too, my friends were pleased with their mushroom swiss, and kobe burgers! The're known for their garlic fries right when you walk in you can smell them, and they are so yummy!! For dessert we had a bread pudding which was SOOOOO GOOOD! I walked out of their full, and happy!!"}
{"text":"Here's a short story about a beer... A really good, delicious, seasonal beer.  I was invited to join some friends for dinner at the Gordon Biersch Brewery in Glendale this past week. When I arrived, they were all drinking, but no one was eating. I've dined at a few different Gordon Biersch locations, so I already know the food is good. This review, however, is just about the beer.  Gordon Biersch beer could, and did, suffice for my dinner. And it gets better every time I try it. The beer that caught my eye, and delighted my taste buds, was the seasonal Pumpkin Ale. It's light, spicy, and refreshing with a hint of cinnamon. In fact, it was one of the best ales I've ever tried.  One thing I highly recommend, is to enjoy the beers on tap at the nearest Gordon Biersch. It's way better than purchasing the bottles in the store. Plus you get the atmosphere and camaraderie of your friends. Or the manager, Amy, who came by our table to see if we were enjoying ourselves. We were. And we will be back for more. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been to the one in myrtle beach and the one in Arizona had a way better time. The food was okay but you are in a hurry to take my empty plate but leave me with an empty glass. We got a total of 2 refills of ice tea only because we asked. No appetizer offered or asked if we wanted one it was typical Vegas service.  Hurry up get them in and get them out. As the customer give me the reason to want to come back and spend my money. And I hate when you take the glass away from the table to refill it especially when your over whelmed with the tables you do have how do I know I will get the same one back."}
{"text":"Went around 230 on a Sunday and it was less than lively. Staff was careless and took forever to come back to the table despite the fact there was hardly anyone in the bar area, where we were seated. My companion and I ordered margaritas and after less than 5 mins of having the drink, somehow a nat ended up in his drink. We had to wait at least 10 mins for the server to return to get a new drink. When she took the drink back to the bar we then witness the miserable looking, older bartender try to reuse the same drink! The server seen us watching and he poured it out, while making it obvious he was upset about something. Smh. There are too many other restaurants in competition and so far they are not measuring up. Don't think I'll be returning to spend my money."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to Gordon Biersch. I've been to this location before and I've enjoyed the food, drinks, and the service, but this time, I went for lunch on Saturday. The food and the drinks were terrible.  I ordered strawberry lemonade and I couldn't even drink it because it was too sour. It was like they forgot the sweet syrup for the lemonade. I offered it to everyone at my table who also agreed with me that it was extremely lemony, and it didn't taste like strawberry at all even though the color was correct.  I ordered a steak sandwich, and I asked for it medium. It came out completely rare. Parts of the steak were tough, greasy, and fatty. I really didn't enjoy that at all.   I won't be coming back to Gordon Biersch anymore. Even their garlic fries seemed lackluster today.  The only thing that was good about my visit was the service. The manager came and asked us how everything was and thanked us for dining there. Our waiter was nice and attentive, and we were in and out very fast. We never had to wait for him to come around."}
{"text":"We had about 20 minutes (actually, like EXACTLY 20 minutes!) to kill before a movie at San Tan mall, so we decided to pop in for a quick drink.    We made it just in time for a last call for happy hour, and I was VERY pleasantly surprised to hear that I could get a Grey Goose martini for $5.  Sweet!  We also ordered the southwestern egg rolls - which seem like no matter where you order them they always taste the same - \"tasty\".    We told the waitress we were trying to make a movie, and she made sure to get us in and out in the the 20 minutes.  2 thumbs, and this will certainly NOT be the last happy hour here."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I've only been here once. BUT I had a great experience. For starters, it's not in the stadium complex so it was easier to actually get a table and have dinner without waiting 40-50 minutes like a lot of the restaurants in the complex. Still easy to then drive over to the complex to catch a movie or get an ice cream or walk around or whatever. The service was terrific. Super friendly and helpful without being annoying. The food was great. We shared the farmhouse burger, the garlic fries, the grilled vegetable salad, and the house salad. It was all delicious. Cooked perfectly. And, again, arrived/dined/got the check all faster than the wait time at some of those other restaurants. Would go again next time I'm in that area"}
{"text":"2.5 really but I'm feeling generous today.  I had the steak baja tacos.  It's interesting that I wasn't asked what temperature I'd prefer the steak to be cooked and they came out medium rare.  A dollar off my hefeweizen was nice...I rarely benefit from any type of happy hour.  Service was prompt upon being seated but non-existent from that point on.  Good thing the bill was sitting in the cup in front of us at the bar else we would have been forced to dine n dash.  Maybe again in the distant future..."}
{"text":"worst 60 dollars ever spent. Only got a beer sampler, a glass of chard, and two entres. Only good thing about this place is the beer sampler...food proportions are small. My bf got half fillet and shrimp and it came with 2 shrimp and the fillet meat was the size of a 1st graders palm. I ordered lobster Mac n cheese. It was OK, I could've made it at home, not much flavor. I also got a piece of she'll in my lobster meat.. . I wouldn't come back for the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beer & root beer!  I came here for an end of the year feast with my coworkers a few days ago, and we were impressed. The restaurant is big and roomy, the ceiling is high like a cathedral and the giant windows makes the environment look bright and comfortable. The service was exceptional and there was never a moment we had to ask for a refill, even with +15 people.  I had the salmon dish as well as the steak tacos. The steak is so tender it almost tastes like the salmon in terms of texture and consistency. Their garlic fries are amazing. The home-made root beer is excellent, if you're a root beer fan. If you want to try something exciting, I recommend the lobster tacos or the crab cakes. Despite whatever you order, everyone's feedback in the group seemed positive. Whether it was the BBQ hamburger, pasta, tacos or salmon, it was well enjoyed.  I'm not sure if I would go here for sports events simply because there isn't enough TVs. In the corner I was sitting, the closest TV to me was about 6 yards away near the bar. So it's definitely not like The Boiling Crab or even Yardhouse in that regard. However, the Happy Hour should make it all worthwhile. I'm hoping to check out the HH the next time around."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here! Our waitress Monica was AMAZING!  We happened in here by accident, and what a happy accident it was. I would happily go back in a second! The whole place smells like garlic. I am in love!  We had a combo of burgers, entrees, and such. Everyone was happy. We all upgraded to the garlic fries when ever possible, a wise decision encouraged by Monica's word of wisdom! Thankfully! And order a side of the jalapeño ranch to with them!"}
{"text":"Show service with a waitress that is completely inattentive.  I think she might be a mute because she didn't speak unless spoken to.  the food is actually good but the service killed the experience.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"I LOVED going to the Gordon Biersch on the other side of town and when we got tickets to the Super Bowl we figured this would be a good stop for lunch on the way to the game. Little did we know there was a private event being held inside. There was no staff at the gate to let us know, and we walked right in through the patio. We asked a waitress once inside for directions to the bathroom, and to the hostess station (it was CRAZY PACKED inside). The waitress was super nice and helpful, directing us to where we needed to go... But she didn't mention anything about the private event. My father went to the restroom and my husband and I went to the hostess station to see how long the wait was. As soon as we get up there, the child working as the hostess asks where our wristbands are (and not in a very friendly tone) and when we look at each other and back at her, clearly we had no idea what she was talking about. Rather than politely tell one of their customers that a private event was being held, she literally said (with the most snotty raised tone possible and snarl on her face.... definitely showing her \"ghetto\" side) \"YOU NEED TO GET OUT\". We were stunned by the way she talked to us, and we politely explained our Dad was in the restroom and we would be happy to leave the moment he walks out. You would think that would be the end of it, but then the MANAGER walks up on us yelling and demanding we \"GET OUT\"! The freaking manager! My husband was pretty annoyed at this point so he point blank told her we weren't going anywhere until Dad came out, and then he went on to tell her in no way were we \"sneaking\" in, we didn't know about the private event, the gate was open, there were no employees telling us anything about the private party, and a freaking waitress directed us up front! She seemed to calm down slightly with us but then stormed off on a rampage, apparently all hell was surely going to break loose for whoever \"let\" us in. It was a complete circus and I understand there was a private event happening, but there was no indication as such when we were walking all the way through the place. Had they just politely explained there was a private event going on, we would have apologized for the mix up and left with no issue. Instead they decided they don't want us as paying customers anymore. We will never go back to this location after being yelled at and treated like criminals for trying to give them our money, regardless of how much I like their food.... It's doubtful we will ever step foot in any Gordon Biersch location again, as this experience left a terrible taste in our mouths. Bummer. But hey, we enjoyed our Chipotle instead and had a blast at the Super Bowl."}
{"text":"Happy hour mini fresh mozzarella pizza!  Schwarzbier!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour, great food and great beer.  The staff Lisa and Josh are both awesome.  Couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good place for a date and a causal meet up with a coworker or friend. The only problem is parking . This is what happens when you have a restaurant downtown. Anyway, back to what everyone cares about.  1. The atmosphere is very inviting and laid back. Also if you want a view while eating this place is it. We sat at the top (3rd) floor in a corner with glass windows all around us. The view was so beautiful at night.  2. The food was really good too! A bit pricy but good. I got the Cajun pasta, it was good but not the best I had. Would I be ordering another 17 dollar pasta that's just average? Probably not.  Would I go back here for a date? Yup.   Also there is Starbucks right below the restaurant, just in case you need to recharge.  Oh for all the Pokemon fans. This is a pokestop"}
{"text":"Word to the wise...don't come here again...food poisoning, stale fish, cold food and awful service are featured items on the menu....there's better places on mill ave."}
{"text":"First let me say there are several flights of stairs to get up to the restaurant brewery so don't drink to much. They do have a elevator if you can't so stairs after eating one of their burgers or drinking to many beers! Personally I like the place because while it's on Mill ave aka college party street, it's not inside.Their beers are decent and worth a try, nothing special but good! The service is great, fast and they refilled our waters and brought the check promptly. Their  burgers aren't ridiculously over priced but for lunch it is a little pricey. Overall A+"}
{"text":"It's a shame the service was so horrible since the beer was delicious.  We had to wait 45 min for our meals, and the only time our waitress came to the table was to introduce herself and give us the tab.  The food was pretty good, but not 80 dollars worth.  The manager was friendly and understanding.  Maybe on a differant night the experience would have been better.  It sucks that 1 waitress can ruin an entire dining experience especially it being the first time any of the 4 of us were there.  Probably going to be the last time too.  I would imagine it would be a cool place to visit if you were going just for the beer and maybe an appetizer."}
{"text":"Its not rare that I review a chain, but it isn't a common occurrence either. I avoid chain food, however, a few of them are worth and it. IMO, Gordon Biersch is on that list.  Some people hate page long menus like this one or the Cheesecake Factory. Not me, I LOVE choices. Although that usually means ordering more than I need or can intake but I am totally ok with that!  Between the options of soup, salad, steak, seafood, pasta, and even the occasional  Hispanic or Asian flare- you can pretty much please everyone. I am not saying every single dish is off the charts, but I haven't had anything I wouldn't order again.  A couple favorites are the Pecan Crusted chicken, Cajun fish tacos, the plain ol house salad (with extra dressing), salmon, and a friend of mine swears by the Cajun pasta, but I have yet to try it. Another plus- convenience!!! I can come here to sit at the bar, have a family dinner, or be in and out within my hour lunch break. Truly a great location in the central business are of Vegas.  Overall, there are FEW chains I would ever recommend, and this will always be one of them!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location. We were happy once again with our dinner and the kids loved their meals. I ordered the Gorgonzola pear salad and it's was lite and refreshing and perfect the way it is. My kids got a hamburger and fries and pasta and mashed potatoes. The kids portions are really good and filled my kids up. We will for sure be coming back again"}
{"text":"The menu looks really good but the food doesn't deliver the only thing I liked about this place was the garlic fries but fries are really hard to mess up."}
{"text":"Out of the three locations I have visited. This is probably the worst one. The food is still very good, but the service here wasn't that great. Next time in town, I will still come by again. Have to have their garlic fries! Burgers are good to. Never really tried anything else. Maybe I should next time!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a family birthday gathering. Hit Happy Hour in the bar for the half price drinks/appetizers. I had a Hefewisen then a Schwartzbier, both were delicious!   For eats, I enjoyed the half spinich salad which was very good. I asked for a little loaf of bread to go with it and the server oblidged. However the bread was (almost) rock hard...talk about \"day old bread.\"   The server was very attentive and was super knowledgeable about their selection of beers. My hubs had the beer flight and she very clearly and concisely offered the details of each brew. He enjoyed all of them...but the Schwartzbier was his favorite. And those garlic fries...for a garlic lover like me...they are a delight!  Overall the experience was just fine...but I honestly think YardHouse is SOO much better!"}
{"text":"GB is a middle-of-the-road bar and restaurant. They have a decent beer list, but it wasn't as extensive as I expected for a brewery. I ordered the Chocolate Red Rye Ale, but was disappointed that the chocolate flavors didn't come through.  The food is also okay. Several of us got the sliders, ordered medium, medium-rare and well-done, but they all seemed to be cooked the same. We also got the mussels (not great), the spinach artichoke dip (good!) and the nachos (great!).  The upstairs dining is also a bonus. You can get some great views of Tempe.  Overall, GB is pretty much what you would expect out of a nationwide American brewery."}
{"text":"I had their nachos 5-8-2018 3ish pm, I ordered it with chicken...had very little chicken, I was in the middle of a conversation waiter asked if I was done, i said yes I wanted the rest to go but he just took and never asked if I wanted it boxed away, nachos were good, but they cheat you on the CHICKEN.....won't be going back, I don't like places where you pay for extra stuff and they give you hardly nothing"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite place to grab a drink and appetizers. We've been coming here for years. The bartender Josh is amazing, knows how to make a good drink and is really friendly. I recommend the Strawberry Soda and Mini Bratwurst Sliders. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I recently went to this location, after work, with two co-workers to partake in the Happy Hour promotions that they run.  We went in and the hostess brought us around the bar area to the dining room.  Now, ordinarily (especially in Las Vegas) most establishments won't honor their Happy Hour specials outside of the bar area, so when we got to our table I asked the hostess if we could still get Happy Hour specials in the dining room.  She was rude and seemed a annoyed that I was asking her that question.  She said she thought we could and I reiterated that most places don't allow that.  She then sarcastically replied that I would have to speak with our server.  Ok, so our hostess wasn't actually interested in being cordial, whatever.  Our server arrived and informed us that we COULD get Happy Hour prices and we ordered drinks and several appetizers.  One thing I liked about this place was that if you order a Red Bull/Vodka (which wasn't included in the Happy Hour cost), they give you the remainder of the Red Bull in the can and our server instructed me to just order a Happy Hour vodka and mix it myself.  I like when an establishment thinks of me and my wallet before their final bill total.  All in all, the food was good and the drinks were good, but the service had room for improvement.  However, I will say that we ordered one of our items, the pototo chip nachos, and it didn't have enough cheese on it.  The manager made his rounds to inquire about everyone's evening and when he stopped at out table, one of the girls pointed it out to him.  He immediately took the entire dish back to the kitchen and had them add more cheese to it.  That just sat well with me.  I'll more than likely be back, but I'll plan for it to be on a more leisurely weekday and hope that the OVERALL customer service is better."}
{"text":"The beer here is pretty amazing and fresh. I love German style beers and they have them nailed. Besides their staples, they also have excellent seasonals and the occasional Brewer's Select that is unique to each location. Come for the beer and stay for the food. I can't speak too much to their menu as I usually just grab a burger and drink more beer :-) My burger is always good and I love the garlic fries.  PROST!  PS - Check out their tapping parties as the new seasonals come out. Always a great time."}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't get the calamari it is so darn chewy so in other words not so good. It's barfood I guess it's a little better than regular barfood. Beer selection small Limited to their beers they brew.. Nice atmosphere patio has nice misters.. clean,service can you some improvement. We sat  20 minutes at the bar waiting to be served nobody behind the bar finally went up to the front to track someone down guess the bartender was sick and had to go laydown. I will try it one more time. I always try to give a place two chances as long as it's not dirty"}
{"text":"(North Scottsdale location) Some of the worst food around. Soggy fries, tough undercooked burger with dripping wet lettuce on the bun. We quickly realized why the place was empty on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice, HATED the food.  The last time I went I had a great bartender. I can't remember her name, but she was good. Too bad the food couldn't live up to the service. Very poor quality menu! Great weekend drink specials and service, but food SUCKS!!"}
{"text":"We went there for a business meeting during a week day lunch time, the place was fairly packed.  Seems like a popular place for lunch gathering as it is very close to the convention center and office space within Howard Hughes.     We ordered the calamari and the blue crab and artichoke dip as starters. The blue crab and artichoke was delicious,  the whole table fought over the little bit left on the plate.   Two out of five of us ordered the California chicken! The chicken was so tender just melts in my mouth, and goes perfectly with the sweet potato fries.. i know not everybody loves sweet potato fries like me but they were just the perfect match.   Service was quick for a large table of us got us in and out in about a hour too!   Great place for business gatherings!"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant/bar a positive review because the food is fantastic and the bar is great, unless you have the bartender with the \"man bun\" haircut. I have been to this location on several occasions with positive five star experiences. Sadly, they have a new bartender who feels the need to text on his phone and talk to co-workers who come in to eat during their time off. He does this while your order is ready and your food gets cold. I literally walked in and saw that he was working and my friend and I turned around and walked to Yard House to eat instead. Hopefully the gentleman with the \"man bun\" is gone by Cardinals season so people can actually get their food and check"}
{"text":"I voted three stars and my fiancé voted four so we will round up!  Service - great! Very attentive and nice! We were seated immediately and never had an empty glass.  Ambiance- very nice upscale place. What you would expect.   Good- fiancé got the Gastro pub burger that was delicious! It had bacon jam and arugula and blue cheese. It was cooked perfectly. I got the artisan grilled cheese. It said it had avocado mayo and like four different kinds of cheese. This thing was CHEESY! A little too cheesy without enough avocado flavor to break up the heavy cheese and butter taste. I couldn't taste the mayo at all. It needed some tomato or arugula or actual avocado to break up the cheese. This paired with the garlic fries was just too much. I could only eat half.   Drinks- the Belgian ipa was very good! It was hoppy but not toooo hoppy. The house made root beer was delicious!   Overall we liked this place ! Next time I will order the cioppino which sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Had a work dinner meeting here last week and was a little iffy on coming here at first. When I hear Gordon Biersch I instantly think of beer. I am not a beer drinker so I thought I should maybe eat beforehand. A little glad I didn't though. I thought about beer and bar food and even if I was a little right, the choices on their happy hour menu were awesome. We were there at 5pm and learned their happy hour menu was still going on for quite some time. so that is a plus if you like decently priced food and great happy hour beers. I ordered the garlic fries for $5 dollars because I was told I had too. (not to mention the smell of them lured me in when they were being delivered to a neighboring table.) along with a happy hour sized bbq chicken pizza. (so.much.food. for $10 total!) the garlic fries were very intensely flavored and left me warding off vampires for a few days to follow. I ate about 2 slices of the pizza before my stomach started to hurt from the food overload. the service was alright. our waitress was nice at first, but near the end I feel like she was starting to get annoyed with us and our little work meeting. (we were paying customers though!) that turned me off. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. the food was good and the amount of choices i had were even better. I made it home with loads of leftovers."}
{"text":"Not the best beers I have ever had, but always a solid place to go off Mill.   I love the upstairs patio.  Their salads and apps are good, I was not a fan of the tacos."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! I felt like an asshole because I sent my steak back a couple times, I ordered it medium and it was well done, but the manager and waitress was awesome about it. The steak finally came just right and was perfectly seasoned! The broccoli has so much sexy delicious butter on it! Don't bother with the wings, they're overcooked and there's not much meat on them. I actually wouldn't get alcohol here either, not a good beer selection and the drinks aren't made well and are in small glasses filled mostly with ice.  Though it's not a steakhouse I was impressed with the steak and I know not to come some where that doesn't specialize in steak expecting them to make it right. The service saved them! The manager was a nice guy with a sense of humor and our waitress was a sweetheart. My friend had a pasta dish that they gladly made vegetarian friendly for him. They went above and beyond for us and I appreciate their efforts."}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants I have been to this is the worst. The server who served us was extremely rude he just slammed the menu on our table and dint even bother to be friendly . We were completely put off by his attitude. Food was really expensive. The only good thing abt this restaurant is that it is located in mill avenue."}
{"text":"Few Paleo options on the menu; the soup today is chili - aghhh.     Every entrée either comes with rice, bread or cheese; chicken wings are fried.   The seafood Cobb is made with fake crab; it's basically wheat with fish broth and food coloring.     The regular Cobb comes with sugary cranberries and two creamy dressings.  I know I can substitute for a vinaigrette and then I take out the blue cheese; it's a bread-less BLT - not interesting.    Going for a piece of fish and mixed vegetables  and grilled asparagus   Fingers crossed its not dipped in butter"}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour prices on beer. I had the Marzen and would highly recommend it to others. The food was a little pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"A friend brought me in here yesterday to try the winter seasonal. We happen to go on a Sunday during the football games and they were featuring an all day happy hour. The seasonal was a dollar off (not much but can't complain) and all hand crafted cocktails were 5 dollars. Not usually martini and margarita type of person but for over 50% off we couldn't resist. All four of us got manly martinis, cosmos, and margaritas.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because I think the Four Peaks winter seasonal is better, nothing Gordon Biersch can do about that..."}
{"text":"Same as before the service was mediocre,  but the food was awesome. From the Signature Garlic Fries, The House Salad, and also the Cajun Pasta, not the prettiest but was tasty!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Nice atmosphere, but food was not that good. Service was decent and wait staff were friendly."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food but it wasn't hot and wasn't great! The waiter was the best part of our whole experience.. Nice atmosphere and the garlic fries were the best part of the meal cause they were fresh..."}
{"text":"It has been several years since being to Gordon's and we weren't disappointed!  The garlic fries are still the Bomb!! Our server Jeff was super cool!! He directed us to the Best choices and gave his honest feedback on some of the items on the menu!! The atmosphere was nice but a bit noisy due to a large group- that Can't be helped sometimes and it's a good sign for the place! People obviously like the place because it was busy for a Thursday! Food was all great- sliders, fish tacos, garlic fries, wedge salad and of course the Garlic Fries!! Very enjoyable evening!! Thanks Jeff!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at Gordon Biersch is where it's at! Great food! Live music! It was overall amazing! Had Sunday Brunch here with a group of about 10 of us ladies. Service was great! Anthony took care of all of us perfectly! I know that sometimes it could be a lot when a party comes in all at different times and orders all at different times and I know that could be a lot. But Anthony did it perfectly. And I greatly appreciate it. There were some servers who you can tell were not too thrilled to be there though. But other than that, great food, great service, great vibes!"}
{"text":"A very nice atmosphere sitting atop Mill Ave. Their food is well prepared and their specialty beers are quite good."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about GB's Martzen, but it tears me up........in a good (or bad) way!! GB's microbrews are delicious and very strong! Be prepared!!    Happy hour at GB is excellent and always busy as hell! If you've been in Vegas for more than a few years you can count on running into a few friends during happy hour at GB.     The food is always good at GB, but like so many other restaurants they've added some cheap ingredients to some of their signature dishes. One glaring example of cheapening their dishes is the gorgonzola salad with pecan crusted chicken. The greens originally used in this salad were a fresh spring mix. It was awesome for a while. Now the salad is made with iceberg lettuce. Needless to say, the taste of this dish has suffered significantly!     GB's happy hour bar food menu is still very good. The Rib Eye with bleu cheese is likewise, excellent! But, if you're going to GB, the beer is definately the star!!"}
{"text":"GB always a good choice.    Gordon Biersch is always a good choice, especially after a day of shopping at Tanger Outlet Mall. GB has a relaxing atmosphere and I admire  the decor on the inside of the restaurant,  with all the subtle references to beer.  The server's at GB are always very helpful and take the time to review the menu and explain the various selection of beers offered. The menu at GB is large with a great selection of appetizers.  If you like fries, then you should sample the garlic fries. These fries are addictive, made with fresh pressed garlic, and pair nicely with  beer. If fries aren't for you, then the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip, or Ahi Tuna  is an absolutely must.  I enjoyed several of the Marzen Beers and we finished our meal with a delicious Warm Apple Bread Pudding. I look forward to my next visit to GB in the future. The prices are fair,  the menu is appealing, and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"This is the traditional place my friend likes to go before hockey games next door at Jobing.com Arena and I see why. They have really good Happy Hour specials, which we took advantage of since we got to Westgate early. Beats getting stuck in Rush Hour traffic and also having to pay the outrageous prices to park for the hockey game!   I had the Blue Cheese Chips, which were kettle chips doused with melted cheese, blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, and green onion pieces, and they were so good! To drink I had a Diet Coke, which they gave me free refills of. My friend got an order of Sliders and some Garlic fries, which Gordon Biersch is known famously for...and the fries were delicious and not overly caked with garlic like they are at Chase Field. Until last night, Chase Field and Salt River Fields were the only places i'd ever had GB's Garlic Fries...so add #3 to this list.   Small, easy to eat items and I got full on the Chips and Garlic Fries. My friend was still hungry since his Sliders only came with 2 and then we split the fries, so he ordered the 8-inch Veggie Pizza. GB's version of the Personal Pan Pizza. it was cut into 6 slices and looked really good! He also had a Fat Tire beer to drink.   We were there for about an hour and a half, since we had time to spare before the gates opened for the game. We left around 5:30 and walked over to Jobing, walking by the shops and restaurants. Last night was a great night to be out and about. Westgate was hopping and not just because of the hockey game either. The movie theater was jam packed, as were a few restaurants and some stores. Some people I noticed were doing holiday shopping as well.   I enjoyed the whole experience of Gordon Biersch. The bar staff was awesome and very cool. Our meals were pretty good, and the whole atmosphere was full of Colorado Avalanche and Phoenix Coyotes fans.   I recommend giving Gordon Biersch a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I went to this place to check it out and it was ok. Lots of fancy menu items but average in taste. Service was really good though and the server was excellent. Sat near the kitchen and saw a lot of people standing around and looking at the tvs ( college football was on ) and so that surprised me. No management presence that I could see there. So an average place to go with high prices and and average food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner before the Coyotes/Stars game.   It wasn't as busy as last time I was there.....so the place was more relaxed and seemed calmer.   My friend and I split a couple of dishes and we both enjoyed the food.   Service was prompt and friendly.....Michael(as in female server) did a great job.  And try the apple bread pudding for dessert......way yummy.   Will definitely stop out the next time I'm in the area for dinner again."}
{"text":"Love Gordon Biersch for their lunch and happy hour specials.  The Southwest Egg Rolls are divine and who can pass up their garlic fries.  Always get great service."}
{"text":"My first Gordon Biersch location ever, and it was a good experience. I stopped by for lunch due to having my car worked on a couple of blocks away, and discovered that there is plenty of seating behind the bar (the bar itself was packed).   The lunch menu choices were decent, and I wound up getting the flat bread. The presentation of it was nice, yet if I had the choice to get something else, I would. The flat bread tasted as if it was a small entree served on a cracker. Very, very thin and without much blended flavor within the bread. Yet I was okay with this, due to trying the various German beers. After sampling a small beer flight (3 samples), I went with the Schweitzbier. In two words: pure bliss. I ultimately ordered 3 Schweitzbiers, which pretty much summed up my lunch order with the flat bread.   Customer service was fine, and without issues. I am certainly coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"I would give this location four stars mostly because of its location rising above the filth of downtown Tempe.  It is a professionally managed chain brewery, so at least you're not drinking the usual american macrobrews, it's clean, and it is mostly consistent.  I remember my time here as being extremely positive if only to escape the knuckle-dragging hooting apes of Tempe for a little while."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I reviewed here.  But we decided to head over for the \"tapping\" of the new Trippel.  Well, that was the first problem.  All this hooplah over the tapping, and then they don't even have a party.  They used to do parties for the tapping.  Everyone would get a free glass of the new beer (not a tiny glass, a full-sized glass!), and there were some food samples, etc.  Not this time.  You had to ASK about the Trippel, and then they gave you a tiny little glass about the size of two shot glasses.  We were in time for \"happy hour\" so we ordered a few \"sliders\" (French dip and brats), and my wife had the roasted vegetable salad and I had the tuna plate.  All on the happy hour menu.  For the price charged the portions were ridiculous.  In fact, most of the happy hour pricing is silly.  $9 for the sliders??  With three potato chips??!  Not much of a discount!  The food itself was pretty good.  Not spectacular, but pretty good.  I didn't try the salad, but my wife liked it.  We both liked the French dip and the brats, and the tuna was nice.  But it was too expensive for the quantity.  Also, our server (Rhiannon) was really good.  Very personable, reasonably efficient.  The food was three stars, and the service was four.  But the value just is not there.  Overall, I'd say \"skip it\".  We mostly stopped coming here for ordinary meals and happy hours because it was nothing special and poor value, and if they aren't even going to have a party for their \"tapping\" (that they trumpet in their emails) then there's really no reason to come here at all.  You can get comparable food -and more of it- for less at other places."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch and brew. Earlier in the day social media notified me it was national hamburger day. Using that as an excuse I ordered the gastro pub burger and my other half had the farmhouse. Both burgers sported the bacon jam. What is bacon jam you ask, it's amazingness that elevates the burger to the next level of rediculously awesome.   I paired my meal with the golden house brew. It's a light lager that fit the bill and accompanied the burger perfectly. Mh other half had the peach tea to which she enjoyed.  The service was extremely attentive and our server, Cameron, was amazing.   Both burgers were ordered medium and the kobe patties were perfect as they melted in our mouths. The farmhouse came with with an over easy egg on it. As the yolk burst with its magic goodness, the burger was one step above enjoyable.   Garlic fries accompanied the entree and we're a touch better than the normal boundaries of fries you get at a restaurant.   All in all it was a great meal and experience. I will definately go back to try more of the items on the memu."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and the experience was awesome. The waiter(feeling bad not remembering his name. But do remember he has flesh cheeks) was very hospitable and knowledgeable. He introduced us the happy hour  menu very concisely and effectively to help us save order time. And the food we ordered was tuna, crab dip, chicken wing and flatbread and each one tasted yummy.   Will return for sure."}
{"text":"We just had a beer and it was a good beer.  It was a hot afternoon and we were thirsty.  Read the reviews while sitting in there and was not too enticed to return. But I would probably give them a chance if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to go on a Friday night. With and without the kids. They had just rolled out their new cheese curds appetizer and the waiter was new himself and was just as amazing as the appetizer. It was golden and crispy outside with gooey cheese inside and big chunks of this spicy bacon to die for. The food and service was soo good that we went back every other Friday night for about 2 months or so. We sometimes got our server and he always remembered us and the kids and it was a great feeling to come to a place and be known. We did notice however that the food wasn't always the same going back. They took off our oldest son's favorite meal and the cheese curds (which we ordered every time) were smaller and sloppier and the bacon was non existent. We have not been back since then. Oh, and one last thing for all you restaurants that serve this: STOP PUTTING KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE ON THE MENU!! I CAN MAKE IT AT HOME FROM A BOX FOR LESS THAN $1.50!! I REFUSE TO LET MY KIDS ORDER THIS, HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE YOUR OWN!"}
{"text":"As far as Las Vegas brewpubs go Gordon Biersch is OK. Prepare yourself for a TGIFridays type of atmosphere, decor, and food and you can do fine. The beer, though, is decent, but unspectacular. All are fair representations of a narrow range of beer styles, mostly lagers. Not a lot of variety in the flavors, but reasonably well made beers. The service was OK, but not great, when we visited."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Glendale and really enjoy this restaurant.  The garlic fries are delicious.  I've also tried the Kobe Beef Sliders and the California Tacos.  Both were very good!  They have lots of small plates to choose from, which is nice.  The servers who have waited on us have always been extra friendly."}
{"text":"Great craft beers with a fantastic outdoor or indoor atmosphere. Super friendly wait staff who are very accommodating. Great place to hang out after a Cardinals or Coyotes game, or you can watch a game on their big screen TVs. You won't be disappointed with the great food selection either."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. I had a good memory associated with this place, it was the first place that my boy and I went for our first date. And I thought I would return with the father. Well I was wrong to pick this place. server was alright not that she was great but she wasn't bad. Definitely need to work on trying to upsell without being too pushy.   Food. We ordered 3 burgers: 2 Cali's and 1 veg. Why would u ask for the temp if its going to come out well done anyways?! And my veggie burger came out way after the other two because I heard them drop the plate. Food runner let me know it was going to be 30 seconds, well the boys had chomped down their burger before I had gotten mine. Anyways I was so upset because I work in a restaurant that I expected them to fix some of their mistakes through some kind of service recovery. Well she did offer dessert but I was upset enough and in a hurry to not take it. Ugh upsetting"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I am a regular and I loved the food and service until I visit yesterday. It was my birthday and i was excited to come in and enjoy great food as usual. However this time I decided to sit at the bar. Big mistake. Bartender was extremely rude to me and my girlfriend. I told him I had a birthday voucher and I asked if it was ok to sit at the bar he replied in a very rude tone of voice \"you have to order 2 meals!!\" Really?! It's my birthday and the right attitude and reply should be hey \" hey welcome and happy birthday, thank you for using the voucher!\" But instead I got a super rude attitude from beginning till end. He had 3 guests at the bar and wasn't busy at all and when my girlfriend asked for water he replied that she had to wait. Yes I understand she has to wait but that's not how you talk to guests. That are tons of other restaurant with great customer service and great food. I feel embarrassed and your bartender ruined my birthday lunch! I will never come back to this location and I just wanted to make you aware. Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Good brewery, just like the one in San Diego but bigger. Love their beer, always fresh and always a good seasonal to choose from. A little ways down the strip but still easy to get to and not too pricey. Good food for sure with nice beer pairings. Good place for a chill lunch and brew without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I like to come here after work for Happy Hour.  The place has always been pretty accommodating with our rather large group of people that usually go there.  It can easily be 10-15 of us if not more.  They'll pull tables together and find a way to seat us all together.  I've never really had trouble with billing issues such as them not willing to split a check, or anything else like that.  There drinks and food are pretty good too.  I haven't had anything but their appetizers as my coworkers and I all find it easier to buy a ton of appetizers and share.  But if their appetizers are good I'm guessing their actual meals are delicious too.  My coworkers and I are doing happy hour again soon and this will be the place we go for sure."}
{"text":"All I can say, is don't come in Friday night. Kitchen was soooo slow. And my grilled cheese with bacon and avocado, was missing the avocado. Oh, and the garlic fries are overrated.  The fresh lemonade was great!! And Bobby, our server did try to keep us informed,  however I did see him start to avoid us, as food was still delayed."}
{"text":"Stopped here before the Bon Jovi concert.  And no, I was not one of the 40-something gals that looked like my dress was manufactured in a scissor factory hobbling around in 6-inch stilettos hoping to attract the attention of the god of 80's rockers.  But I highly recommend attending such a concert, if for nothing else, the people watching.  And not just for the women.  I thoroughly enjoyed the guy in front of me and his air drumming skills.  Anywho, back to Biersch's.  It was packed, but we did find a seat on the patio.  I liked that the bar was open to both the restaurant and the patio, so that you could sit at the bar but still be outside.  I was concerned about being late, but my husband, who is apparently way cooler than me, schooled me in that it's perfectly acceptable to arrive late.  Uh, when it's over $300 for 2 tickets, I want to see EVERYTHING.  In spite of the crowds, our server Michael, was on top of it, as was the bar.  Drinks came really quickly.  The kitchen was a little slower, as was expected, but still reasonable.  We ordered the Brewer's Feast ($17) which included Kobe sliders, garlic fries, southwest egg rolls, and hummus.  The sliders and fries were 4.5-star good IMO, egg rolls 4 stars, and hummus 2.5 stars since the crostini was not very good.  We also ordered one each of the mini dessert tasters...strawberry cheesecake, chocolate cake, brownie mousse, and apple bread pudding.  None were outstanding.  I think the mousse was my favorite.  Not sure a full meal would garner my 4-star rating, but for drinks and appetizers, I'm a fan.  And we were on time!  BTW, when did a t-shirt become 50 bucks?  I'm pretty sure they were not that much in 1986!"}
{"text":"Thank you Host/Server Marcus S for your incredible service!!!!  Marcus was very pleasant with EXCELLENT customer service and you can tell he genuinely enjoys working for Gordon Biersch. He has a great demeanor and full of personality. You made HH a superb experience along with the Chef/s!! I highly enjoyed spending Super Bowl here. Gordon Biersch has HH every day and night of the week!!   I HIGHLY recommend the following: *Apple Bread Pudding!! AMAZEBALLS!!! It seriously tastes like french toast with spiced maple syrup which in actuality is their whisky sauce. *Garlic Fries. *BBQ Chicken Pizza w/light bbq sauce. (SUPERB!)  I very much love the atmosphere and the outdoor fireplace. Its so comforting and relaxing."}
{"text":"4:15 dinner tonight, it was us and wait staff. Service was good. R had the veggie burger, she said it was an 8. I did not try it, veggie burgers scare me. I had the Red Snapper, and it was good. I think it was frozen, but getting Gordon to get me fresh snapper is asking a lot. A bit less taste than fresh, but I enjoyed it. Both fries, sweet and regular were good. The true measurement of fine dining. I can't remember not liking the food at any GB."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat on a wim.  Kids can eat their hot dogs and fries without any fits. And husband can get his beer. This is a nice location because they are upstairs and their outside balcony overlooks mill avenue. Really great on a spring day."}
{"text":"great salads and their fries and chips are to die for.My friend's love their grilled cheese (not on the menu) and i've always had awesome. service. Great place for lunch and a good beer!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! This place rocks!!!! Bavarian pretzel and sausage plater is soooo good. I would have a pic but we eat it to fast. Cheese curds rock very tasty. The beers I tried were also great. The executive chief visited our table and was very friendly and accommodating. Renee our server could not have done a better job. I would even recommend this place to my mother inlaw."}
{"text":"ASU ASU! I went here to watch the last home game and have a few beers. I go to Gordon Biersch when no one can decide where to go for 2 reasons: 1- they have beer and 2- they have a vegetarian, vegan and gluten free menu if you ask.... Always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is now one of my favorite go-to spots because they have vegan, vegetarian and gluten free food menus. It is a great place to go with a diverse group with diverse needs. And of course, they have BEER. Beer is always good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to GB in a lonnnnnng time and I've recently been on a craft brew kick so I thought I would give them a try. I tried their seasonal beer and their Heffy and both were delicious, the feel of the restaurant is very cozy and our server was on top of things. I got the jambalaya sans shrimp (blehck!). It was pretty good, my only complaint about the dish was it was pretty bland, no Louisiana Cajun spice and much was needed in this dish. I would get it again but might bring my own Cajun spice to add some flavor again. Great place for a first date or 100th."}
{"text":"Here on business and I was looking for a mellow place to grab a drink an have some dinner. Rachel was my server in the bar area and she very helpful with suggestions with what to order. I ended up with a burger and garlic fries and it was delicious. I will definitely try this back I'm SD."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to give this spot a try (my first time). It was late in a Saturday night where service seem slowed. We get to ordering and the waiter is s character (funny and charismatic). The food arrives.. The food was cold, tasteless and not what I expected from a place like this."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food and friendly atmosphere - perfect spot to have a few drinks and lunch.   Compliments to our bartender (I don't recall his name) and the rest of the staff for being so friendly and permitting our dog to join us out on the patio. Everyone seemed to enjoy Reaper's company and couldn't believe how gentle he was!  I will definitely be returning for the garlic fries and I know Gordy loved the cajun pasta! Thanks for a nice afternoon, Gordon Biersch!"}
{"text":"The hefeweizen was really outstanding.  The service was quite good.  The food was fine.  I enjoyed it, but it was very standard chain food type stuff.  My mac and cheese was good, but not great.  My dining partner's steak was quite good.  I would be happy to eat here, but I would probably not go out of my way to do so.   Except that Hefeweizen is really really good..."}
{"text":"Good news first... Server was solid, food came quickly and I enjoy the GB brews. However, trying to eat healthy, I ordered bruschetta chicken. The chicken breast was paper thin, about 1/4 inch thick. Completely overcooked  and incredibly dry. Where can you buy a chicken breast that thin? This was a $14 entree! Tiny, thin, overcooked breast on a bed of brown rice. Rice was fine, asparagus was ok, but the star if the chicken dish (the chicken) was terrible. Totally disappointed. There were 5 of us dining and 2 of us were very disappointed. The other three enjoyed their meals. If my math is correct, you have a 60% chance of enjoying your meal. That's a D. I've had dishes at GB before that I enjoyed, but not tonight. Ironically, no one asked how everything was...I was itching to tell them. Guess I'll share with Yelp instead."}
{"text":"Great beer, decent burgers, not great dinner...TOO LOUD ALL THE TIME!!  A place with 200 people doesn't need a crappy band to play way too loud. Last time I was there I found myself screaming to the girl across the table from me.  We were 2 feet away from each other and on the opposite side of the place from the band...and it was so loud I felt like I was in a club.  Lose the bands, improve the dinners and keep the beers great and you have a good place.  I had a jambalaya and it was just awful.  It was rice with some meat and a spicy sauce.  Not good at all."}
{"text":"We shared the tapas and I had the brewers chicken, hubby had the lobster Mac and cheese. The food and drinks were wonderful, but our server Khaun really made the night for us. He found out where they buy their tomatoes so I could attempt a homemade bruschetta similar to theirs, and treated us like royalty. I am in love with the olive tapenade that came with the tapas. The only thing that went wrong was no Baileys for my irish coffee. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a great birthday dinner last Friday. Our waitress was great and so energetic. I love the menu which is varied. We liked the Atlantic cod fish and chips, shrimp and mango tacos, chicken schnitzel and fries. The atmosphere was positive and fun. We had been impressed with the Burbank CA brewery and found this Las Vegas location much to our liking as well. It was hard to make choices but I plan to return often!"}
{"text":"Came here for a second time on 11/02 for my birthday. There were 4 people in our group. I had the kobe cheeseburger which was a little bland and the fries seemed as if they had spent a few  rounds in the deep fryer. If I had known they didn't have the capability to blend my margarita I wouldn't have bothered. My boyfriend had the steak frites which looked like it has been regurgitated by a baby bird onto some fries. Towards the end of the meal the waiter was getting a little short tempered and we had to ask another waiter to bring us the dessert menu. Took 15 minutes just to get two desserts. Will probably not be going back. This is more of place to have some beer and watch a game. We called the manager and were told that he would be giving us a gift card for $140. I also did the online survey and received an e-mail from the district manager, I told him that the restaurant manager was taking care of the problem. 3 weeks later and I receive a gift card for $50, umm ok that didn't even cover what we spent on two out of four people. Food and management could use a renovation. If you are looking for a really good meal go to The Yard House right across from the theater."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and a friend who was in town. We were seated quickly and the server was nice. The food came out and the order was wrong but no big deal we ate it anyway. It was just average food, not really worth the cost but maybe I should try something different. Wouldn't seek it out but wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: golden ale (once finally arrived at the table) was very good. Garlic fries were tasty. Burger was good.   The bad: drinks arrived at the table the same time as our meal. The elderflower martini was weak. The wait staff was uninterested, inattentive and overall MIA for most of the meal. The Caesar salad was overdressed and the chicken was scarce. Our second round of drinks were cancelled due to the extended wait time.    They need to step up the service game."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this chain while in Atlanta. This location didn't let me down! Great atmosphere and service was good. Love those steak frites."}
{"text":"My family loves this location. We go for happy hour on Saturday every week and sit on the patio. We can enjoy drinks, tapas, or whatever we feel like. We relax, our child has a good time. The staff is awesome. My husband goes for the beers, has his favorites, and enjoys them. I am more of a $5 premium cocktail girl. You cannot beat those deals on happy hours. The passport rewards card is also a huge benefit. The servers will offer or give one. We have already racked up tons of rewards. We usually eat some happy hour apps to share, have salads, or flatbreads. Good way for a light cheap dinner and cheap cocktails. We haven't tried it at other times in years so this review is just for the past several Saturdays for the past few months. The manager is a nice lady too. Very attentive to our child."}
{"text":"The prices are high for what it is, but the food is delicious. It's a great environment, nice waiter/waitresses, the beer is excellent and it's a variety of selections.  I do have to stress the prices are the thing that brought it from 5 stars down to 4.  No lunch specials, either."}
{"text":"First off this is a very nice property, it is well maintained, and clean, and it's easy too find as it stands out on Paradise Road. The beer here is good for what it is, it is predominately German Style Lagers, which are damn hard to brew in the desert by the way. All are well crafted with no off flavors and the Chezch Pilsner is outstanding! I also love the Heffe which is true to style and quite refreshing on those hot Vegas Days! The food is average, nothing spectacular and it is quite pricey. I mostly go for the brews! Service is very good as every employee I have had contact with there has been very pleasant and courteous. This is definitely worth a stop in, especially if staying in any of the hotels on Paradise."}
{"text":"The two stars are based on the food only, which was amazing. The garlic fries were to die for! We came in Tuesday night and sat at the bar. The bartender seemed annoyed even though the bar was full. She was attentive but not friendly. It got weird though when one of the male servers came over and started talking badly about other guests to our bartender who he is apparently dating. I could tell because they kept kissing... on the side of the bar... in the middle of the bar with it being full.. it was weird. It wasn't the worst experience ever but I probably heard every single employee curse multiple times and the bartenders boyfriend just completely ruined it when one of the tables asked for a drink and he says to the bartender \"fuck them tell them we can only make them this or that...\" It's like this guy has never worked at a restaurant before and doesn't even know how to act in front of guests.  I may be back because the food was awesome but maybe sit at a table and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here!! I am a frequent customer. :) The serving staff is the best. Make sure you order the Garlic Fries!!"}
{"text":"I went to Gordon Biersch in Scottsdale yesterday for lunch due to its convenience to my job but I will never go here again as I feel deceived.   It's important to me to know the caloric and nutritional values of what I eat so, when I saw salmon on the \"lighter side\" menu I thought I'd find my lunch option there. We're all familiar with those lighter options, right? As Gordon Biersch says \"Full flavor. Less guilt.\" So, I order the salmon with season veggies and sweet potato fries. I figured since I'm going the healthy, light route, I could have a few sweet potato fries. While waiting for my food, I decide to complete my daily food tracker and look up the calories in the salmon.   684 calories.   Wait. What?   684 calories in 5 ounces of salmon. I thought surely the tracker was wrong. This can't be right. This is supposed to be the \"lighter side\" of Gordon Biersch where I can get full flavor with less guilt! I ask my server (who was very nice...everyone was very nice) if she has nutritional information and she directs me to the website. Certainly the number is more favorable there. I was wrong. 684 calories is absolutely correct.   Well, hopefully it tastes good, right? Wrong. It was overdone and lacked flavor. Full flavor, Less guilt, my butt.   False advertising. I won't be eating here again unless I want to blow 3/4 of my day's calories in one mediocre tasting meal."}
{"text":"Visiting from Oregon and the food was delicious, prices were good, and customer service was great!  We also received 4 Free Entree vouchers for next time we visit!"}
{"text":"I stopped here, because I like to try new beers. I had a delicious Hefeweizen to drink and a hummus salad to eat. I thought it had a wide variety of food options on the menu. It was about $10 for the salad. Full meals were a little on the pricey side, but the portions were large. My only disappointment was that they didn't have soft pretzels on the menu."}
{"text":"Did up happy hour here, very nice work, so much food and drink for an awesome price. Only reason for a four star = I had to drink my wife's drinks because they were not that good. Bloody and the margaritas, two staples one can't mess up were really not that great... luckily I am a man that can't see a soldier go down alone and I took care of them!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is still the best restaurant near The Strip. I am downgrading the rating from five to four stars because of the poor service we revived this last trip. From a bartender who could not remember any drink orders to needing to call over a manager in order to get served at all, the service was not up to their usual standards.        Real food      Large portions      Good prices      Easy parking  We will go back the next trip, but we're rather disappointed."}
{"text":"The kitchen was so filthy we left with out eating. Garbage cans over flowing. Garbage on the floor and general disorder across the entire back kitchen. I looked through the window and it was enough for me to immediately walk out and i will never return. I felt sorry for the people eating there when we left."}
{"text":"As always - GB is amazing. I try to find one wherever I travel, and this did not disappoint.   Started with the Ahi app and it was seriously delicious and a little spicey. Yum.  I also enjoyed my GO TO on the menu, pear gorgonzola salad, yum yum yum! Always fresh and crisp. My friend and I shared a Chicken sandwich and it was really yummy. The hefe was delish, too! Always great service, great atmosphere and the food is consistently GREAT!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I went for dinner last night after a visit to the Apple Store. It was packed, but our wait time was maybe 10 minutes. Service was prompt, courteous and attentive. I ordered the sirloin steak and I must say it was excellent. We will return again."}
{"text":"This place isn't terrible. That being said...I would only revisit for the delicious beer selection. In fact, I did just that. Stopped in and grabbed a bite to eat shortly after flying in. After traveling all am, this was my first meal of the day, so I was admittedly borderline hangry.  After seating myself at the bar, the bartender was quick to help me find something cool to drink. I'm a fan of German beers, and the marzen and schwarzbier definitely fit that niche. I quickly ordered the steak street tacos to satisfy my empty stomach and was completely disappointed after my first bite. Everything seemed so...uninspired. I love me a side of beef, but the steak was overcooked, possibly heated in a microwave? IDK...they should stick with beer if that's the amount of effort they're going to put into their food.   So...the three stars are strictly for the beer selection which is delightful and drew me in a second time...but only for the beer."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was just not very good.  Got an app, the sausage platter or whatever it was and one of the burgers. All were just so so, along with the beer. Was it average....yeah....just not something I'd come back to"}
{"text":"I had a turkey burger that was just excellent.  The spicey flavor was amazing.  Just couldn't get enough of it.  Brew recommended was particularly good.  Love sitting on the second floor deck this time of year.  Parking nearby is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is tough to admit, but I think Gordon Biersch has the best food on Mill.  I only came here three times and tried the pasta, salad, fish and chips, IPA, and flat breads. The place is a bit pricey. However, I have never been disappointed by the food. I brought my friend here in April. She still talks about this place once in a while.  \"John, do you remember the flat bread from that one restaurant on Mill?\" \"John, the food here isn't good as that one restaurant on Mill.\"  The place is usually packed and the servers are attentive. They have to be since they're making 18% tips on such expensive entrees. I read some of the 2-star reviews. If your server sucks, don't tip and write a complaint on the receipt. But give this place another chance. (Just don't get the same server)."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night because I was craving a margherita pizza. In the past I have had totally delicious pizzas and salads here. The pizza is no longer a pizza but a \"flatbread\" that tasted like a saltine cracker and while the flavor of the pizza wasn't that bad it left me still super hungry after eating half of it. I ordered homemade potato chips \"smothered\" in creamy caramelized onion cheese sauce with sweet & spicy caramelized onions. topped with fresh green onions and crumbled feta cheese. I ended up with a plate of homemade potato chips with a few sprinklings of green onions and feta and a huge pile of onions, was there a sauce on it? I couldn't tell. The best thing I tried was an individual beef tenderloin slider, it came with 4, yes 4, potato chips and a slider for $5.95. The tenderloin was so tender and had great flavor but the buttery bun wasn't buttery and you really couldn't tell there was bacon, carmelized onions or cheese on it. Our server was good enough and I wouldn't penalize her because the restaurant she works for has gone downhill. Even for happy hour I won't go back. I left still hungry after spending $25 on three small plates items that just weren't worth it and went to my local bar for a real margherita pizza for only $5"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  The food is really mediocre.  The fish and chips were really breaded and soaked up all the oil.   My son ordered boneless chicken wings and they were literally frozen chicken nuggets with sauce on top.  My daughter had macaroni and cheese and it looked like they heated it Up from leftovers.  My husbands hamburger was just ok.   Can get better at all the new joints like The Habit and The Counter.  This place needs to revamp its menu in a big way.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"MENU CAHNGE: So I've always enjoyed the flatbread tapas at happy hour. I dragged a bunch of friends for full price dinner here last night and...  they have replaced their flatbread with what appears to be straight up from the box Matzoh Ball CRACKERS.  I think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread.  So $10 for some crackers and tiny scoops of hummus, bruschetta and tapenade is steep. But then I realized my friend had ordered the flatbread pizza and was struggling to eat it because CRACKERS can't support the weight of pizza toppings and sauce.  Another guest politely asked the waiter about the crackers and the server said it was a permanent change.  Here's a permanent change: I will be going to one of the other couple hundred gastro pubs in town with great atmosphere. Or hell, just walk across the street to Firefly for actual tasty food!   And the fresh brewed beer isn't worth it--a lot of the brews are heavy with a syrupy honey taste. bleh."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place, the food is great. It comes out hot and food runners are polite and all the staffs as great customer service! Our server is the bomb.com, her name is Allison, thanks girl you were awesome!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their food and beer.  Everything is from scratch and was super delicious.  I had Bistro Steak Medallians that were cooked perfectly to order.  The menu had so many different options it makes choosing between dishes difficult but the staff is very helpful.  The Happy Hour they have is awesome and it is all day on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere + great food + great beer and drinks = Favorite place to go in Glendale."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for their happy hour around 5PM on a weekday and I have to say that this is a pretty great place.   Located right by the strip on Paradise Road, this place is easy to access even though you might get some traffic on your way there at rush hour. The restaurant offers a very large parking lot, and I had no problem finding a spot.  Service was a little slow that day, but the food we were served was pretty good and definitely worth it for the price we paid. I had the artisan salami pizza for $8.50 (Happy Hour price) along with drinks, and the value of all of it was very good given how little we ended up paying. Definitely a great Happy Hour place in Las Vegas.  In the end, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good Happy Hour close to the strip. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend to attend a networking event. Event didn't happen, but manager Brad and his staff were above professional w/customer service! He even offered to call the other locations to make sure we were at the right spot, then offered us water while we waited!  Courteous, spot-on customer service! Thank you, Brad & staff! :-)"}
{"text":"If I could give it a lesser grade I would. First off,their artichoke dip feels like air, second their Gorgonzola topped Rib-eye was actually Gorgonzola BUTTER. Very greasy. And the stuffed chicken is fried, which nowhere on the menu does it mention that. Terrible food, very misleading."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better review but its my civic duty to warn my fellow yelpers of the horrid service I experienced here. I came in here on a Sunday around after studying at the library with two of my friends. As soon as we walked in the hostess seemed annoyed that she actually had to do some work. We finally got seated and our server came up and read off a prepared statement he had written down on his bad to talk about his beers. He took everyone order and never came back with our drinks =(.   The really crappy thing is the fact that the food took forrrrever to come out. And we weren't the only ones. The manager just loved walking around doing absolutely nothing. I mean everyone in our section was sitting there for at least 30min+ with out any food and he just frolicked around the restaurant with a smile on his face like this is how it supposed to be.  I hate the Kobe burger which was pretty whatever, just like an over-priced patty that people think is really high-end, but the garlic fries were pretty good. My friend had a lobster tacos which came with a cold side of rice/beans and for $15 he expected at least 3, not 2 tacos. Sucks for him.   I've been here before for HH and its always been pretty good but i dunno wtf happened this time. Whatevers, ill check it out again for HH, but man that was a horrrrrible experiece"}
{"text":"Very tasty! The service was polite and the food came out fast. I liked the lighter menu. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken with jasmine rice and steamed vegetables. It was a pretty filling meal for under 575 calories! We also had the blackened ahi tuna appetizer, and it was very good! B had some southwest chicken sandwich; he liked it.   We would go again!"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating, always get the appetizers and a pint. Sliders are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, come here if you want to dine or if you only want drinks during happy hour... NOT for the happy hour food.  Let me start off by saying that the ambiance is great: excellent lighting, decor, place settings, etc.  The bar area is like a classy sports bar and the noise-level is at a point where you can still have an intelligent conversation.  The food in the dining area is good and the service is solid.  The GB home brews are also pretty smooth and only run around $3.50 for a 22oz glass during happy hour.  The happy hour food is another story.  The Mediterranean Flat-bread and the Asian Fusion Combination are not only small, but they are also mildly gross.  The service is also very favorable to the regulars.  After you go to the Yardhouse for their happy hour, it's hard not to compare the two due to their physical proximity and since they have a semi-similar look.  However, the Yardhouse has better food, bigger sizes, and better happy hour deals.  But, GB is a decent stop if you need a break from the Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Their Marzen is great - excellent draft beer. Not a big fan of dark beers, but Schwarz was very good too - not too heavy with nice coffee finish. Not much to say about Golden Export, but sometimes it's the best thing - quite decent lager. We were there to watch an ice hockey game and couldn't find a table with a good viewing angle, so ended up sitting at the bar. Service was quick, not much too say about food - we only had appetizers typical for any sports bar."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past 2+ years and have seen a decline in service and more important, the food quality.  We found it odd so few people were inside when we arrived, the sign of times to come   .....     perhaps          ......    After this last visit, we will NEVER be back!  Visited Sunday, May 24th, ordered Koby Beef Burger, Ahi Tuna Sandwich and the Grilled Cheese (adult version, not kids).    Kobe burger was delivered to the table missing the bacon that was to be added to the order.  There were about half the number of french fries on that plate that were on mine so the fry order was shorted.  The fries were limp and undercooked and VERY greasy.  The burger, well this is supposed to be a quality piece of beef (price reconfirms that) and this burger was lifeless and tasteless absolutely a HUGE disappointment.  Tuna sandwich was good, sweet potato fries, again limp and undercooked.  Grilled cheese, was soooooo salty, I could barely choke down 1/2 of the sandwich and left the other half on the plate.  Fries, same as above...  Later that night....the 2 of us that ate and or tasted the Ahi-Tuna got horribly ill so come to your own conclusion there.  Going to try Bourbon Jacks across the street.  Parking lot was full of patrons so excited to go check it out.  I have a feeling many of the former patrons of Gordon Biersch have traveled across the street for their meals and have bid Gordon bye-bye..."}
{"text":"Decided to explore what Tempe has to offer and Gordon Biersch hit the spot!!! Drinks? Perfect! Food? Phenomenal! Hospitality? Second to NONE! Mucho thanks to Greg and Josh for providing an awesome experience for a first timer! Be sure to try the Gorgonzola Ribeye when you stop in!!!"}
{"text":"Standard food - exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant with a brewery. They sell beer, lots of beer, so the food doesn't have to be amazing. The southwest rolls we ordered as an appetizer were great with a bit of a kick to them. My pecan crusted chicken was good, but not my favorite meal by any means.  They have a large drink menu, which is nice for us non-beer drinkers. I especially liked the alcoholic raspberry iced tea."}
{"text":"First off, they have a few very good brews.  Their Belgian IPA is actually very good (not widely brewed in the area) and their Marzen is a solid interpretation.  Gordon Biersch has become pretty big in Las Vegas and they sell by the cases in many stores so it is much more than a restaurant.  Still I like a good beer and can respect their recipe for a few types.  Now we move on to the food side of the company.  I went for lunch a few months ago.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary taster of their Belgian IPA (as mentioned before, delicious).  I then had a chicken sandwich that tasted like any other sandwich at any other pub/restaurant.    I would definitely come back to Gordon Biersch because I like the vibe of the restaurant, they have some solid beer varieties, the beer is not too expensive, and they have TVs to watch some sports.  Still, the food is not the magnet of this restaurant's appeal."}
{"text":"I should start this by mentioning the 1st time we went to Gordon Biersch in San Diego, CA over 20 years ago...we were not impressed. Them they opened one near our home in Pasadena, CA....and the staff was so snooty, we left, so.... Well, this place is Wonderful. Darn, did get the Super Hostess's name....rides the cute mini bike, but our waitress, Renee, was amazing. Their patio is doggy friendly and our Sadie enjoyed napping under our table. The Mediterranean Pizza....oh my goodness!! Even our Amazon Parrot, Cisco sez the pizza crust...yummy! My Sweetie had the fab sausage plate. Everthing....OUTSTANDING, we shall return. Our only suggestion would be to hose down the Patio, our Sadie....got a tad dirty. But hey, she and we ENJOYED!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant in town. We have tried this place a few times thinking it was maybe just an off day but every time we have an issue. Either they messed up our order or our order took over 30 mins this last time or the food was brought out cold... it's never ending with this place. The service is awful with the exception of the managers which always have to come try to make it \"right\" after a bad experience."}
{"text":"Service today was great everyone was nice and gave my food on time, this was probably the best service I've gotten in a while!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and filthy. The men's restroom was filthy with water or something on the floor. Glasses were also extremely sticky. Service was slow and apathetic. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I travel for work and GB is usually a great place to stop for dinner.  Unfortunately this GB was less than stellar.  I was dining alone and waited over 10 minutes to get any service in the bar area.  I was given a glass of water and told someone would be with me.  Another 5+ minutes went by before the waitress came.  I could understand if it was busy but there were 2 waitresses and 5 tables with customers. I ordered a salad and the lettuce was brown and the tomatoes were mushy and rotten.  I would not recommend this GB to anyone unless you love bad service and bad food!"}
{"text":"I am giving five stars because the service was beyond expectations. I ordered the woodford bourbon salmon, and that was a BIG mistake for me....the sauce really made it inedible for me because I don't like BBQ sauce. Our very nice waiter insisted to have it changed to a new one with no sauce. Other than the sauce, everything else was very good. Highly recommended plates are baja sauteed fish tacos, cajun pasta, garlic fries, and burgers (any) so far. Will definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Avoid!  Like the other reviews stated, food is so so at best.  The staff was slow, and didn't ask us why we only ate a few bites out of each of our meals.  Really sad to be quite honest."}
{"text":"Worst service. Took over an hour to get our dinner. About 35 minutes to get our drinks. Our server NEVER checked on us. Seems like only 1 server for the whole outside patio. Went to complain to the manager . Never saw him either. He said he would come when he can\"\"\" terrible ! The only reason this place got 2 stars is because the Gorgonzola rib eye was so delicious ."}
{"text":"Three stars because our server rocked! David was Super pleasant and attentive. It's always nice to have a personable person take care of you when your out for a night on the town.   Now for the rest of the review: Dirty table - yes it was cleaned before we sat down but crumbs under the rolled napkins and on our seats  Dirty silverware. Unrolled my silverware to find food on my knife. Yuck. Food - burger was sub par and greasy. It literally was leaking out while I tried to eat and ended up having to eat it with a fork - use better quality meat -especially for the price The steak was over cooked and that is enough to ruin a good steak dinner for anyone."}
{"text":"Really diggin the southwest egg rolls and garlic fries :) not a big fan of the beer but they have some killer cocktails! I had something with grapes and tequila...gosh, obviously I had too many cuz I don't remember the name! Lol  I would def recommend and if you had too many...it's in the mall so you can walk it off!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Monday night last week. The food was good, but the service was VERY slow. I did try the seasonal beer, cant think of the name right now... something very tropical-ish, loved it. We also tried the pan seared potstickers as an app which were good. Shrimp-chicken combo. For dinner I had another item off the seasonal menu, jerk chicken tacos. Interesting concept, and quite tasty. The portion was big, enough for 2 meals for me. The beans and rice that came with were unremarkable."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  Everyone raved about their food and rightly so.  I had the seared ahi tuna with wasabi aioli and was soooo sad when I was down to my last bite.  It was a little expensive for two items on the plate but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad, I've been to other locations, but this one would probably be my favorite for 2 reasons.  It's the closet one to my place :), 2nd their patio area is on 2nd floor overlooking the streets.  Maybe I like looking over people and watching them or something, but it's rather fun haha!  Gordon Biersch is always known for their garlic fries--don't go to the gym the next day I tell ya if you have a bunch of these blah!  They have their own Gordon Biersch brew of beers; I don't recall each, but they have beer tasting flight which can be fun.  Definitely bring your group of friends to the place!"}
{"text":"3 stars for happy hour only. The $5 cocktails were exactly that...1/2 the alcohol for 1/2 the price.   Garlic fries were good.  Potstickers and sliders tasted reconstituted.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I went with my friend yesterday.  Nice atmosphere, nice area.  I had the veggie burger and garlic fries and my friend had the  smoked chicken tostadas.  She said they were the best tostadas she ever had.  Our waiter was great.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hostess and server = complete incompetence. Food was fine, nothing special. Weak mojito."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour-  beers were $3 - most of the apps were between 5-8 bucks.  Great selection of appetizers-  get the ahi tuna salad and the pizzas!  Waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This Gordon Biersch is in a great spot and, with upstairs dining, provides a nice view of Mill Ave or the monsoons (should that be your sort of thing). The food is predictably corporate but the beer is, for being 'macro-micro', good. So, all in all, it's a Gordon Biersch.   I've had the best luck here for lunches or happy hour (as others have mentioned, it's still a bit on the pricier side) but would not recommend this location for a large party as we had a company dinner there once and it took a week just to get the reservation and the night-of service was sorely lacking. It may have been that some staff called in that afternoon but, whatever the disconnect, the service of that dinner is still an office joke.  But before an ASU game or a midweek happy hour -- yeah, hit the bar area at GB."}
{"text":"Post marathon fuel!  Came here after running RNR marathon this year. I quit eating hamburgers and fries prior to race and also didn't have any alcohol for a long time to get my body prepare for my race, I had to eat burgers, fried and drink beer!!! This place was located near the RNR finish line and parking garage where I parked my car earlier in the morning. Take en elevator to the 2nd floor to get seated. I took it to the third floor first and had to walk down, oh that was hard!  Server was very friendly with nice smile. He let me sample three different beers to help me decide what I wanted. Dark German bier was the best for me and I surely enjoyed my drink. So tasty but strong, one was enough. Good thing I didn't have to drive home.  I always like their garlic fries. Anything garlic is very good. Unfortunately Kobe beef burger wasn't what I remember it to be. Tasted like they used regular beef.   Located in the heart of downtown Tempe. Sit outside balcony and enjoy the sunny AZ weather while watching people or dine inside with lots of TV playing some sort of sports. Good beer, good service, what else?"}
{"text":"I like this particular Gordon Biersch location. I normally come here with a group of people and always enjoy their food and service here.  They know how to cater large group, every time I came here, they coordinated well that food was served at the same time.  I really like their garlic fries here. I end up with heart burn but so addictively good that I cannot stop eating. Their food is good, it's a bar food. I don't eat bar food regularly but once in a while, it is good.  Great happy hour price, good place to come with colleagues after work."}
{"text":"GB Beer Mushroom Chicken AKA goodness in your mouth. The chicken and asparagus were cooked to perfection. It was one of those lighter meals; just enough to feel full with no regrets. The husband said it looked foofie, but it was manly enough to fill him up.   Fish & Chips...Golden and crunchy in all the right spots. Tender and flakey Atlantic Cod with the salt and pepper fries, go to there now. Great service from waitress Meghan and the manager even stopped by to say hello."}
{"text":"You want to know about the garlic fries,right? Yes the garlic fries and ambience are good enough to come back... Try it"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with my sister who has a citrus alley. Our server, Nicole- was amazing- and the chef even came out to discuss options for her meal to accommodate her allergy. Delicious food and some of the best service I've had at a restaurant. Sweet potato fries were perfect."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the excellent beers they brew on site. Good happy hour prices for beer. The food is usually good, but sometimes it's not, and I do find the food prices to be a little high, so I usually just go there for some drinks at the bar. Bartenders are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here with my family because it smelled fantastic from outside and by all accounts, the food delivered. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we pretty much finished our plates. I would rate the food a solid 4 stars.  The reason for the 2 start review is because the service was sub par. Being with the family we did not order any drinks and watched as another family directly next to us had outstanding service from the same server but we had multiple delays, unfulfilled orders, no silverware, etc. I usually tip extra to compensate for the non alcohol on the tab, but this was so obvious that it merits a review."}
{"text":"I've been at Gordon Biersch operations around the country and they are all consistently good.  They've changed the menu somewhat since my last visit (unless each restaurant gets to design its own, which I doubt).  The food is good and the service friendly.  This particular branch is on the second floor and has a little bit of a weird layout, but it's attractive and you can also eat outdoors on the balcony.  Of course, the beer is quite good, as it has been at every one of my experiences at these restaurants."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It's a brewery so it's the typical American bar food. we went right when it opened so there was no one there. we ordered to-go. the food was good, average. the garlic fries were awesome! the coleslaw was good! we ordered the crab cake sandwich. it was tasty, but the crab cakes itself were a bit too bread-y. i  think they put too much breadcrumbs in the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I ordered the Marzen barbecue chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The sauce on the sandwich was good but the chicken breast was pretty tasteless.  The garlic fries were a winner!  Service at the bar was fast and friendly.  It was nice to have a TV to watch as I ate lunch."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for several years but the last two times were the worst, the food was dry and salty.    Decided to give it one last try, last night when we arrived the hostess was in the front changing the trash can they have sitting outside.  She saw us coming in so she opened the door for us, she then walked over to the podium, grabbed menus and silverware, escorted us to our table, all without washing her hands after changing the trash can.  After we were seated we were not greeted or acknowledged by our waitress.  One dude was too busy dancing around , one waitress was sitting at a booth too consumed with her cellphone noticing nothing around her.  Several people were just walking not concerned about my table. After sitting there for almost 10 minutes we walked out.  I will never visit this particular location again.  Terrible service, unsanitary and terrible customer service at this location."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and for some reason I am just getting around to writing a review. I was there with some coworkers for a luncheon and the service was as good as always, heck maybe even better considering it was party of 19!   Let me start off by giving a HUGE shout out to Gina and John, our waitress and waiter of a table of 19. They were OUTSTANDING!!! Well almost as I am giving someone who shall not be named a half star for not asking if we wanted to have dessert before presenting us with the check. Hello! That was no-no. However I must admit this person redeemed themselves hence the reason why I go back to saying OUTSTANDING service!   The table started off with four orders of the southwest appetizer sampler which included bison sliders, jalapeno cheese and spinach dip, and the southwest egg rolls. Everyone dived into them immediately as we had four of them on our table and were a hungry bunch. I must admit, they I tried a little of everything and it was quite good. I had never had bison before and it was very lean and very juicy. Very, very good.   Next everyone ordered everything from theSpinach Salad, crab cake sandwich, burgers, Tuscan chicken pasta, and slew of other things just to name a few. I ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos with those fabulous garlic fries. Now I must say that I was disappointed in the lobster and shrimp tacos as they were overloaded with old bay seasoning which made them EXTRA salty. I am a fan of old bay but you gotta use that in moderation because that is some salty seasoning. FYI if for some reason I am mistaken and they did not use old bay (which is sure as heck tasted like it) then my apologies but it was still do darn salty. The garlic fries however were yummy as always. If you are not a fan of garlic I would NOT recommend that you try these fries or you will be beyond disappointed. I am just happy that I don't have to talk to anyone in the near future because I am sure I reek of garlic. No vampires are coming near me that is for damn sure.   We also ordered dessert after of course I made a fuss ( but in a good funny way) and believe me it was well worth it. My one coworker ordered the warm apple bread pudding and she swears it was the best bread pudding she has ever had. I am not a fan of bread pudding so I will have to take her word for it. Everyone else ordered the mini dessert tasters that come in tall shot glass. Just enough for a little taste of heaven without going over board. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and although it was very good, I dang near choked on the crust at the bottom of the shot glass. That is what I get for being greedy. Other coworkers ordered the carrot cheesecake mini, chocolate peanut butter mini, chocolate fudge cake mini and of course a couple of the strawberry cheesecake minis. Someone also ordered their pumpkin pie cheesecake and like the bread pudding, it got rave reviews. Again I will have to take their word on it.   I will give them 4 out of 5 stars. Why not 5? Well my particular lunch was not outstanding, although everyone else seemed to have enjoyed theirs and not exactly offering dessert. Again I do give HUGE shot out to Gina and John and also to the cute hostess (I will let them wonder which one I was talking about) Awesome service indeed!"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch recently with a friend.  The lunch time clientele were mostly working professionals, but we had no problems getting seated right away.  I like the layout of this place as it is open and inviting.  I ordered the Kobe cheeseburger with garlic fries and my friend had their signature beer battered fish and chips.  I asked for a medium rare burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  Their garlic fries are to die for.  A real treat for those who love fries.  My friend's fish and chips were equally as good.  We had a great time here with good food.  I would definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great service. Loved the bratwurst sliders. They were awesome. Deep fried artichoke hearts were very good. Seating options allowed us to watch sports if we needed to. Thank you for a great lunch."}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. We had a group of about 30 people and the waiter was by far the best I have ever seen. Handled every single one of us without any problem.  The food was pretty decent. The salmon was yummy.   Did not care for the brown rice.  The house salad was amazing.  Loved the employees. Everyone was attentive and friendly and accommodating.  Great place."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The waiter is nice and try to seat us outdoor. He helps us move because we can't stand smoke. The food is like most francise restaurant. It is good for me. I like steak and shrimp the best. The shrimp is fresh since I can tell by the texture of the shrimp and there are still a bit smell of the sea. (My taste bud have weird reaction to sea water so I know) I will visit sometimes when I have time."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Came here for drinks and the garlic fries. The fries were good, but not great as I'd heard. The food was good, sorry, I forgot what I ordered. I did get a side of the slaw and it was delicious. That's all I remember, I guess the drinks were good.  I'll check this place out again. It's worth a second trip"}
{"text":"Two stars and that is a gift.  The fries seemed like they were old and then fried again to warm up.  The pretzel tasted like rolled bark in flour with a pound of salt.  The cheese sauce tasted like it was old with cumin. The flatbread had so much raw garlic on it, I think I'm going to be sick.  On top of all that, the server was so rude and couldn't careless if we liked our food, it was not worth the bother. I will never eat the food here again. That is for sure.  I will go for a drink, but that is it.  Now I know why these franchises are going out of business."}
{"text":"We have been going to Gordon's for along time and since they continue to change their menus it is extremely frustrating. Our waitress even today expressed how it stinks to work there and try to manage through the menu. The small plates are way over priced for the quality of the food you get. Dry chicken with some lettuce thrown on top and potato chips with some sauce and flecks of cheese - no thanks.   We won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food and beer is consistently good, but the servers at this location could be more attentive and responsive. Not sure why, many are standing around."}
{"text":"They do happy hour all day on Saturdays, which features great prices on food. The beer was very good, especially since some breweries tend to serve their oldest/worst beers during inexpensive happy hours. There were plenty of sports on the tvs, and they also have patio seating. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. Kinda hard to find being behind Bahama Breeze off Paradise, but we spent $50 for dinner and beers, which is GREAT for Vegas!  If you have the chance to sit by the bar on a Saturday, make sure John is your server. He is a master of his craft and super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great Hefeweizen. Love the Garlic fries too. Nice large place. Great for haning out with friends after work or a movie."}
{"text":"I'm giving a chain restaurant a 5 because our Server, Monica, was seriously FUCKING AMAZING!! No lie. No joke. Not exaggerating. Seriously, Monica was probably one of the BEST Servers I have ever had the pleasure to wait on me.  No need to review the food. It's a chain restaurant. The beers are good.   But it's ALL about Monica!!"}
{"text":"We have been GB fans for many years. We enjoyed years of beer and friends at the old Boca Park location. The original GB on Paradise is showing its age. GB suits continue to find creative ways to drive business away. The latest is happy hour. The old happy hour was 3-7 with all day happy hour on Sunday. Great. Now they have changed to 4-6 Monday through Friday. Tuesday is all day HH on GB beer and open to 5:00 on Saturday. Sunday 4-6.  Why? Is it the end of the world? Not quite. Does it seem like something senior management dreamed up in a meeting? Absolutely. How can we get less people in our place? Let's cut the HH down. Give your working loyal customers a break. A few bucks isn't the point. The drive across town isn't worth it now. DT Summerlin it shall be. Thanks"}
{"text":"I have been to this GBBC location many times in the last couple years.  Its a very good place to go if you are living at the Residence Inn across the street as I did for a while.  The beers they brew there are all pretty good, although some of them are pretty strong and they sneak up on you.  I have found myself stumbling back across the street more than once because of them.    I especially like going to the Gordon Biersch on Sunday afternoons.  They usually have a band and the place is always filled with these cool locals who must come here after church.  The odd thing is, they are always dressed a little like pimps or something.  I've never seen anything like it before.  But it is cool as hell because everyone there always seems to be having a good time. But I always feel a little under-dressed.  Where would one buy a purple velvet suit anyway?  I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The service has always been great.  I have been to other GBBC locations and this one sets the standard."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a weekday evening. We had a group of 6 and had a reservation so we were seated immediately. You probably won't need a reservation if you go during a similar time. Service here has slowly been declining and more recently during this event, the service was at its all-time low. The hostess was pretty helpful but after that, our server came by very infrequently and rarely refilled our drinks. We ate relatively quickly so after we paid, we stayed for a while to chat. During this time, our server was absent, and our drinks sat empty. No one bothered to clear our table or check up on us."}
{"text":"There is nothing remarkable about Gordon biersch, unless you dig that corporate type feel. Both the food and the beer are unremarkable. The only cool thing about he place is the patio overlooking mill ave."}
{"text":"Okay, I do love Gordon Biersch as a whole but this one was a little below par compared to others I've been to. We ordered 3 dinners. A kid's burger, a chicken parm and the NY strip with tempura shrimp. The chicken parm was bland and really nothing special. The garlic mashed potatoes were cold and hard, the steak was warm (though cooked medium as ordered) and the tempura shrimp were warm. Given that the chicken parm came out hot, this is classic \"die in the window\" waiting to be served while the other order was still being prepared. For $20+ entrees, simply unacceptable.  The waiter never came back to check on us after the orders were served. That's serving 101 in the restaurant world. If he had, I might have gotten a chance to tell him what was wrong, but he didn't. I like GB in Glendale much better. They seem to always be on top of their game."}
{"text":"I went with my parents tonight thought it would be busy for a Friday night but we had no wait. The atmosphere was relaxing, no loud crazy music. There was music but kept pretty low, so no one had to scream to be heard. Our waitress was training a new person. Who btw was doing an awesome job. They both were super friendly. They asked if we wanted to try a sample of their beers and I said sure. They brought me the one I asked for and 2 others they thought I might like. They were all very good beers. I liked how they knew what each beer had to offer and they gave suggestions based on things you like. My dinner was delicious. The garlic fries are totaly amazing. They were refillable which can be a dangerous thing for me lol. I would eat and eat them all night long, even though I was stuffed with just one serving. Thankfully I have a little willpower. I will totally recommend to anyone that they should eat here. Our servers name was Tiziana. Thank you for the awesome service to you and your trainee."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding. We ordered grilled cheese, mini brats, steak, and a chicken sandwich.   Sandwich was cold and a little too charred.   Mini brats were good.   Steak was burnt   Grilled cheese was ok.   Server was nothing more than just a server, which is fine. I know she was busy.   Maybe will give it another shot, as we will be living across the street soon."}
{"text":"We went to Gordon Biersch Brewery before a Coyotes Hockey game. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time. They get slammed before games and the service slows down. I had german sausage, garlic mashed potatoes and mushrooms with Spaetzle (German pasta). I  liked everything, but I really liked the Spaetzle. I will be back to try other items on the menu and to get more Spaetzle."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Came here with my 13 yr old daughter. Took 30 minutes to get a bowl of garlic fries, almost an hour to get our food. Waitress was more interested in socializing with the tables of loud, obnoxious drunks, than serving a dad and his daughter. Even had to wait to pay my bill. Finally got up and paid my bill at the front desk. Food quality has gone way down since I started coming here a few years ago."}
{"text":"Great food/beer - pushy waiter!    This was my first experience at Gordon Biersch.  My parents were visiting, and decided to take my husband and myself out to dinner.  I ordered a beer and the lobster and shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent. My husband and parents all ordered burgers and beer.  I didn't try the burgers, but the garlic fries that came with them were to die for! I loved everything about the restaurant but the waiter.  He was extremely pushy and would not take no for an answer. If it wasn't for him, I'd give the restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good beer. I had the tuna steak and it was the worst I have ever had. Very fishy. Veggies were undercooked and tough."}
{"text":"I used to go to Gordon Biersch every time I stayed at the Marriott across the parking lot.  Nope, no more.  The drinks were ok but I have to say the service the last 2 times has been apathetic.  The servers just don't care.  If you have a big party consider another option.  The food is bar food meh.  But when you wait for drinks you wait for help and you see you're blatantly not cared for, go elsewhere.  Gotta say sorry Gordon Biersch.  You lost me.  Don't bother contacting either.  When 2 of last 3 times you were poor service...bye."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience for the most part. Place was fairly empty and took a while to deliver some pretty basic burgers, salads and mc n cheese for the kids soooo knocked them down a bit for that. Black n Blue Kobe burger was good - went with the slaw as the side, mistake. Tasteless. Beer, however, was great!"}
{"text":"I hate Mill Ave because it's trendy and often overpriced for the college scene, but we happened to be down town and stopped for a quick beer or two and bite to eat.  The view upstairs on the patio is to die for.  Our server was SO WONDERFUL and friendly. If the staff reads these reviews, please give kudos to the tall southern boy who knows his beers! I wish I could remember his name. So sweet and on top of refills and he really knows how to read a table.  He pointed out so many things on the menus about the food, beer, specials, etc. he's what made us decide to order some appetizers and everything was hot and delicious.  We will be back because of his service first, but the great beers and appetizers also. We want to try happy hour next."}
{"text":"We were disappointed. The portions are small for the price. My happy hour glass of wine tasted old. We got the southwest nachos and they had almost nothing on them, plus the chips are wonton chips with make the flavor over power the rest of the little toppings. The service was good and the ambiance was nice and the whole place was clean."}
{"text":"Still one of my all time favorites but I will have to say the menu and food is not quite as good as it used to be. The beer selection is still top notch.  The menu still offers a lot of choices but when an old favorite disappears it is hard to be unbiased.  I still will frequently dine here but just miss the GB that opened here many years ago."}
{"text":"We booked a private room at Gordon Biersch for an informal reception for our small wedding (36 people, including bride and groom). While the booking process was a bit distant, our coordinator was very effective at pulling together all the details needed to make the dinner run smoothly. The food was delicious, the staff on the day of were very friendly, and we were able to duck into the room slightly early to set up. When we went slightly over the three hours we'd booked, the staff weren't at all rude about it either, they simply worked on speedily cleaning up in the background as we had our final hugs with our guests. There was also plenty of parking for guests. A solid choice for an informal, small reception."}
{"text":"I arrived just after 10pm on a Wednesday. They have a limited menu and its all bad for you! The Kobe sliders were delicious. The tapas flatbread has a nice medley of dips/toppings. A Marzen lager washes it all down nicely. The place had a good vibe with people laughing but not too crowded.  The waitress was beautiful and friendly.  Check it out."}
{"text":"In a year that has so far been defined by culinary episodes of grand disappointment, Gordon Bierch doesn't fail to fail - in fact, it just may be the king of the worst.  A recent happy-hour visit to the Boca Park eatery had me doing something I almost never do -completely reject of the entire meal.  Along with my micro-brew selection, I ordered an Asian themed trio of appetizers, which featured Shrimp, Egg Rolls and Potstickers. After a small sampling of each of the three offerings, I was literally so disgusted that I pushed the plate away.  To begin with, there was no plate presentation. I likened it to walking through an art gallery, looking at blank walls. The Egg Rolls were cut at a bias (yea art) and the Potstickers were covered with a trail of Ponzu and Mustard Sauce (but we'll get to that later). Otherwise, there was not even a simple piece of Kale to offset the distinctively bland looking trio on a plain white plate.  Shrimp - by par the \"best\" offering of the three. The shrimp looked and tasted like boxed, frozen, breaded 40-60 sized shrimp that I think were prepared in a microwave. Even the delightfully refreshing Sweet Chili Sauce did little to detract from the bland taste and pasty bread coating.  Egg Rolls - I am not sure who \"discovered\" this specific recipe, but they should consider a career change immediately. The rolls were stuffed with chicken and some sort of brown sauce that one could not even distinguish what flavor it was suppose to add (or subtract) from the dish. Each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by an unsavory chalky taste and a not-at-all faint aroma of frying oil.  Potstickers - I would like to say I could tell you what the Potstickers tasted like, but the trail of Mustard Sauce was so powerful I could barely wash the taste from my mouth with the bitterness of my micro-brew. The sauce is extreme, to say the least, and could easily impart it flavor with as little as a drop on each Potsticker. Instead, the kitchen decided to drown each Potsticker with almost a teaspoon worth of this disgusting concoction. I wish I knew what the chef was trying to accomplish with his tragedy, but if you are unfortunate enough to try this one out for yourself, I can tell you a spoonful of the Sweet Chili sauce straight to the mouth will help in your recovery.  The only reason Gordon Bierch gets 2 stars instead of 1 is entirely due to the micro-brew Pilsner I had, it was admittedly pretty good.  Perhaps the best way to express how utterly disappointing Gordon Bierch is, would be tell you that, after I left, I went down the road to The Yard House in Red Rock where I was treated to two beautiful and savory works of culinary art from their happy-hour menu - at just about the same price.  Being a two star and not a one, I will dare to adventure again to this establishment for its micro-brew - and to give the chef one more chance."}
{"text":"When did $14 for a salad become the norm? Other than high prices, this place is just like all the rest. Waitstaff that ignores you until you make yourself know. (Like we are invisible people). It's the 21st century,  step up your game, not down. Maybe if I go when it's crowded, I'll get noticed faster....maybe, just maybe."}
{"text":"Lunched it up with some coworkers here. It was your average bar food mixed with some other overpriced menu items. I really liked the garlic fries but I didn't find any reason that I would make a return trip."}
{"text":"overpriced and the food is average to below average. Crab cakes tasty super fishy and the beer was not cold. Salmon was ok and the garlic fries were WAY too garlicy. And I love garlic.  Try somewhere else when in the area. This is a overpriced chain restaurant with average to below average food."}
{"text":"Even though I've walked or drove past several Gordon Biersch locations in the Bay Area over the years, I've never been to one before. I prefer my breweries independent, as well as separated from restaurants.  I was staying nearby and figured it was worth checking out, rather than making the trek towards the strip. I'm glad I put my biases towards macro beer aside, because I actually enjoyed my short visit to this brewery that just so happens to serve food.  The beer here appears to be brewed on site by brewmaster Julio Lanzas. That alone is rare for a restaurant brewery chain. It shows in the final product. They have a few beers that you won't find bottled in your local supermarket.  The Session IPA was surprisingly hoppy and not exactly what most people think of as a sessionable beer at over 5% ABV. Who knew a German brewery could brew such a decent West Coast style beer. No it's not fantastic but for the price and location, there's not much better fresh from the tap.  The IPA was a bit of a miss. It's a bit less balanced than the Session. I didn't taste much hops on this one. It was what I would expect from GB. Especially after trying the smooth hoppy Session immediately before it.     The Stout was a thick, delicious, slightly stronger version of an Irish Stout. A mix of Imperial and Irish perhaps?   I was pleasantly surprised with their Belgian Tripel. I'm not normally a fan of the Belgian stuff but this was an incredibly well done take on this style. Kudos to the brewmaster on this one.   I like how they have several different size glasses to choose from at reasonable price differences. I rolled with the pint size since I wanted to try several different beers during one visit, but you can go all the the way up to 23.some odd ounce glass if you're feelin' randy.   The service was great. The bald bartender was on top of it with me and all the other customers at the bar. He is definitely an asset to this business.    Actually after visiting the strip, I appreciate this place that much more. It's not overpriced, the beer is decent, with a variety of styles and great customer service. Other brewpubs could use a lesson from this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my team for a holiday lunch. The food was great, the noise levels were a little on the louder side, but it was around the holidays so it was crowded, which is to be expected. The staff was really nice and the location is so convenient."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and wow have things changed. Portions and quality went down quite a bit. I ordered the Kobe burger because I had it once before and used to be delicious. This time the bun was almost stale. The bun looked identical to the ones at walmart that you got eight for a dollar, sad part is that it tasted worse than those.  I have to assume they are trying to cut costs and it shows. Everything seems to be a little more bland. I hope they change it back soon because I really used to like this place."}
{"text":"They have happy hour everyday!  Great place to meet up with friends for food and drinks. Don't order the $5 cocktails, they are full of sugar and light on the alcohol.  The beers are great and the $5 appetizers are very tasty.   I ordered the rosemary chicken flat-bread, yum!  The mini BBQ chicken pizza is delicious!   Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times & had good food and good service. Came here most recently on the 4th prior to the fireworks. Had no problem getting a table outside to people watch below.   Tried a few of the sandwiches, all good. I may be alone on this, but I'm not a huge fan of the garlic fries.   Has the type of menu where there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. I met a friend last minute for happy hour a few weeks ago and based on a past experience over a year ago, we decided to go back. The wine selection and happy hour appetizers were really good and well priced. Our service was excellent too. The waitress had a great personality and even made me laugh. Tough to come by these days so i appreciated that. Wish i got her name. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard chain restaurant, really nothing special. It had been YEARS since I had been to a Gordon Biersch... and I think the menu is exactly the same as it was in 2006, including maybe the beer selection. It was graduation night in town and this was he only restaurant we could get a reservation in, all the other restaurants were completely booked for the 7pm timeslot.  We show up and Gordon Biersch is COMPLETELY empty! Lol.  We were the only people there.  I don't know how it's possible that the service is super slow when we are the only table in the joint.  Anyway, if you need food, they have food."}
{"text":"Went to GB in Tempe once years ago, was happy to find them in my neighborhood.  M and I went there before a movie and sat in the bar.  What is up with kids in the BAR?!?!?!?   Anyway, the Kobe beef sliders were awesome, the 1/2 chicken walnut salad yum, and the shrimp and chicken potstickers were just OK.  They do have various microbrew choices, as well as some bottled stuff like Miller Lite.  I like to try a place's specialty brews.  I had the light- eh, good enough, the hefe was more fruity than I've ever had, really tasty, but could only take one glass.  We liked the laid back atmosphere and happy hour prices were good!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"\"Gordon Biersch Swillery & Franchise\"  There, fixed it for them.  These people need to be hit in the nuts with empty bottles of Anchor Steam and about the neck and chest with full bottles of Shiner Bock.  Take your restaurant concept to Chandler and bug out of the best piece of real estate on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"We have eaten at GB several times and have never been disappointed. This time, the food came close to a three but the waiter was so bad I had give it a 2. My husband had the stir fry. He liked the flavor but it was barely luke warm. Either it should be a cold salad or HOT. I had 2 small plates. They were meh, not bad, but pretty spendy for what I got. The waiter was the issue. He was friendly, initially, but we never got refills on our water or iced tea, he never checked back and we had to track him down for the bill. After he took our credit card he was over flirting with another staff member and helping her organize something at an empty booth. In the meantime, we waited a long time for our receipt."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Not sure if the server was just in the weeds the entire time or if the patio just needed additional servers but this was a pathetic experience. On top of it we were overcharged on our bill. Ugh. Not again!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was ok, server was average. I guess I just expected more for the price. Most items $20+. I eat out 2-3 times per week and will pass by here next time. I'd say its worth driving a few miles to desert ridge and eat at BJ's if you want a brewery type restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Gordon Biersch multiple time for happy hour, lunch, dinner, and booked the private room for work gatherings. The location is perfect for north strip employees to grab a bite off strip and for off site meetings with it being very accessible from the airport. Though I do enjoy this restaurant for convenience, they are not amazing at keeping your drink full and the front host area is often congested with employees not providing service.   Hour Hour - They have a menu for happy hour that includes drink specials for each day of the week such as $5 Martinis or vodka specials. They also have a food menu with appetizers like their garlic fries, seared ahi tuna, fish tacos and flat breads ranging anywhere from $4-$7. There are plenty of TVs to catch games however I've not witnessed volume for them. Happy hour is daily from 3pm-6:30pm and all day on Saturdays! They also offer it again for the late hours of 10pm - close. *only available in bar area (bar, booths, and high tops included)  Lunch - They do not offer a lunch special or half portions during lunch but it is a great place for business lunches. During the lunch hour it is mostly workplace professionals throughout the dinning and bar area.   Dinner - Full menu offered including drinks. Reservations are not required nor usually needed. They can easily accommodate small and large groups.   Group & Private Events - I've utilized their private room for two work events now l with group sizes ranging from 15-30. They provide a menu upon booking to order catering style. In the past we've done sliders, bruschetta, salad, pizzas and risotto appetizers bites. The room can be set up with long or round tables to accommodate the room along with linens. The space also has a coat rack for guests and is located near the restrooms. They also have plenty of parking accommodate large groups.   *Vegetarians: They have a great southwestern black bean burger"}
{"text":"I love GB for their Happy Hour and their Dragonberry Mojitos!  I'm a huge fan of the tapas appetizer.  I only wish they had more vegetarian items on the menu.  Great ambiance, great service....will continue to be one of our \"go to\" places near home.  Update 5/15/12:  They've changed their menu and added a vegetarian and vegan section!  Love it!"}
{"text":"If it's a beautiful  Friday night happy hour in May, how about letting people sit on the patio instead of keeping tables empty until the 7:30 reservation arrives? I mean, if it's 5:30 and your visitors want to go outside, let them!  Other than its misuse of real estate, this Gordon Biersch is not bad. The environment is really nice. It's pretty busy, so if you're looking for an all-male business crowd, this is the place.   The $5 pizzas during happy hour are pretty tasty. The crust is good.   If you're looking for a good happy hour, and don't need a busy spot, try Satay, across the street. They serve lots of beers and mixed drinks and have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great food! Garlic fries, marzen burger, and the artisan grilled cheese were all excellent! Even the garlic spinach was delicious. Small selection of beer though. Overall, the food will being me back."}
{"text":"Beer kicks a**! But the food is just \"ok\" and some of the staff was rude, snobby, and somewhat lazy. Now, that being said, one of the male bartenders was one of the hardest working dudes we've seen in a while... cleaning and helping customers constantly... as for the rest... not up to the task of German purity in work ethic."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. The food is OK, but I could go without the garlic on the fries. Not my thing for such a garlic taste.   Beer wasn't bad, but the selection is mostly (mabye all? I forget now) of their own beers. A bit of everything but nothing that stands out."}
{"text":"We had a great time this time around! Previously, our wait time for service and food was less than poor; however, with delicious beer and great patio seating, it's hard to stay away. We were pleasantly surprised this time with Josh. He was not only quick to greet us at the table, but went beyond expectations. I couldn't remember which beer I sampled last time at first, but he ended up brining me my ordered beer and a sample of another that I might fancy. Josh was great at checking in with us for refills, friendly Sunday Funday banter, and provided a great experience here at GB. I look forward to more with him and the great beer!"}
{"text":"Not bad food at all.  I had the chicken BLT sandwich - it was fresh and plentiful.  For a brewery, they didn't have a very large amount of microbrews - I think they had 7 or 8.  I tried the Czhech Pilsner and it was darned good.  The only thing bringing them down is the service - we sat outside and had to hunt down our waitress a couple of times."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home from work to grab a beer.  The bartender was very helpful and let me sample a couple before I landed on the Schwarzbier dark beer :)"}
{"text":"OMG...the GARLIC FRIES! SERIOUSLY,  the garlic fries!  They are super awesome!  Okay...sorry let me move past the garlic fries.  I had the Lobster and Shrimp Mac and Cheese (reco 'd by the waitress)...meh! The lobster and shrimp...small portion of both mixed in with lots of pasta  :-( The cheese sauce...bland; which is surprising given havarti and parm...but it was just...meh!  Would not order again a bit expensive for two shrimps and three pieces of lobster. My sister ordered the Lobster and Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes and she liked it but it wasn't something she would indulge in again because she said it was a bit expensive and was not that sensational. She said the cakes were good and seasoned well. We did order an appetizer,  the very tasty and extra scrumptious Southwest Egg Rolls...ORDER THESE! YOU MUST! I also had a glass of Hefeweizen, pretty good...this is my favorite choice for their craft beers.   My advice when you go, GET THE GARLIC FRIES and the Southwest Egg Rolls fer' sure.  I mean you just gotta' but skip the pasta and crab cakes...lots more choices on the menu.    Oh...by the way...order the garlic fries!  The reason i gave it 3 stars is because of the expense vs. the taste of our entrées."}
{"text":"I live here in town and this is probably my most favorite place to eat. the food has always been good & the staff is very friendly.  the street tacos are my faaaavorite. =)"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.  We didn't like the sliders and we weren't impressed with the Beach Tacos.  Server was pleasant but had too many tables to be effective."}
{"text":"Just got the worst customer service ever! They were rude and completely horrible. They didn't have any patrons in there and I can totally see why. Avoid this place at all cost!!"}
{"text":"This is a fine restaurant to go to when you want to get away from the noise and chaos of Vegas.   They also have Czech Pilsner on tap. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love it! Strawberry Soda paired with the Chicken Pruschetta Sliders & garlic fries. Perfect bar/dinner atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in 2 years and they dont have them in San Antonio. Booo. I was craving their Garlic Fries.. what can i say? You know when you build something up in your head and it just let's you down? Well that just didn't happen! LOVE their garlic fries. Also tried their Cajun Fish tacos and they were overstuffed deliciousness. Not at all spicy so the \"cajun\" in the title isn't really necessary but tasty all the same."}
{"text":"The lobster tacos are a joke! I got literally three pieces of meat on taco. I would call these salad tacos! Everything else was good but the tacos are a joke."}
{"text":"Two words.. Garlic Fries! No one can beat this garlicky goodness. Your breath will ward off lurking vampires that i guarantee but you will not complain..soo worth the breath!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times during routine Mill runs and for dining. Food isn't the best, but it is pretty good. Drink selection is solid. You should expect ten to twenty minute wait times and above average service. Stay away from the appetizer platters- they don't deliver."}
{"text":"went here with a group from work and it was okay. the kobe sliders could have been better. i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty.  one really bad thing was the beer...the house beer i wanted was not available for what it felt like 30 mins as they were changing the tap. that was silly...i had to settle for another beer."}
{"text":"Love the beer, the appetizers are good too.  Just a great place to hang out, can't wait until it cools down and can hang in the patio!"}
{"text":"MMmmmm beer.  Good beer.  I had a hefeweizen that was pretty awesome.  The food was decent and our server didn't let us down.  It was crowded in there too but she never missed a beat.  The shrimp and lobster tacos were positively awesome!  Too bad Vegas is lame and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, we've been to other Gordon Bierschs that tasted better. Shortly after we were sat, we went to the bathroom and they were absolutely disgusting. It was hard to eat our food after that. Manager and employees were just hanging out talking, so it's not like they were so busy they couldn't clean it."}
{"text":"Good food but service is iffy. Four of us ate dinner (including rice and chicken breast) without silverware and they said they were \"looking for more\" and finally brought it when we were a few bites done from being finished. Didn't really say sorry or offer discounts or anything. Pretty lame. But we did learn to eat rice with a skewer broken in half.   UPDATE: Called the manager and told them what happened. Never got an explanation on what happened, but they said sorry and sent us a gift card to make up for it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a shame that this location is closing. The staff has always been friendly and the food is always good. Luckily some of the staff here is getting transferred to the Paradise location. :-("}
{"text":"They closed the kitchen 10:30 and not 11:00pm . I bring my friends yesterday and we can't eat . We lose time and money with lyft , I usually go in the Burbank. They have to change the hours on the web site , btw the lady who spoke to me was very rude . Very Disappoint with Gordon Biersch Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food very much, but their self made beer isn't that awesome. I would go for something other than beer next time but would definitely try all of the food here."}
{"text":"One star and that was due to the service being good.     I went there yesterday with my wife and son and it had to be one of the worst food experiences I have had in a long time.    I ordered the Margherita Flat Bread - only the corners were cooked - the rest of it was soggy - it was like eating some melted cheese on raw dough.    My wife ordered the Garden Turkey (burger) with a side of cole slaw - she got chips - the waiter did bring an order of cole slaw he was told of the mistake - The Garden Turkey was disgusting - looked like they just flashed the outside for color and the inside was 100% raw -    My son ordered the Artisanal Grilled Cheese - there was a lump of bacon smack in the middle of the sandwich along with some avocado spread -- BUT -- NO CHEESE - how can you make a grilled cheese sandwich without the cheese. at least he had his french fries to munch on.    Needles to say - my wife only ate about 1/4 of the sandwich before she gave up- my son just ate the fries - not even a bite out of the sandwich - and me - I ate the whole thing raw or not - I was hungry -    After bringing this to the attention of the waiter, the manage came over and offered to have the meals made over again. we declined and he took 50% off the bill. Nice gesture, but for two practically uneaten meals - should of been taken off completely-"}
{"text":"Food-Great.  Beer-Great.  Service-Absolutely Terrible.  Ryan M was our server and everything was a challenge, drink refills happened finally as checks came along, took 15 minutes to get credit card processed, and never even offered desert.  It is a shame that such a good restaurant had such terrible service."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips and reasonably priced. The Parmesan fries are a must try and worth it. Over a great Place to eat and I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner and seeing as it's so hot I decided on a light choice. I had the crusted seared ahi tuna and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"This had been my dads favorite restaurant. He bragged about to everyone.we came in today never to return again. First off they changed the menu but not for the better. We normally came in for the gorgonzola rib eye which was gone. Only had top sirloin which were really small for the price & though were cooked right had zero flavor. Biggest flaw of the night, the service.our waitress took our order wrong, so I was left with no food while everyone ate.finally my boyfriend that to walk up to the chef because we couldn't find our waitress to see what was going on.We ordered coffee which two waitresses had to chase each other around since one had the cups the other had the coffee pot. It was ridiculous. Finally we were done with the food which he had to eat because it was expensive, waiting for the waitress again! We got up ready to just pay with the hostess, magically the waitress suddenly noticed us because she was scared we were gonna just walk out without paying.never returning!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch gets a 3 star for food alone but gets a bump for solid brewing and great location. The bartenders and waitresses are very attentive and and they're also very easy on the eyes. On a warm afternoon you can just enjoy the weather on their upstairs balconies overlooking Mill Ave and ASU."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to meet some friends for a drink. We had a larger party (8) and the staff was very friendly and willing to get us seated  quickly. We really appreciated this since we didn't call ahead. I ordered a beverage from the specialty cocktails list. The Cucumber Basil Collins was very refreshing and deeeeelicious!!! I would order this again!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 2 stars because the beer was great. And garlic fries amazing as well. However, I ordered some ranch with my fires. No big deal they forgot. But when the guy (RICARDO) came up to me with the fires I simply said \"Sorry, I asked for ranch\" In which he replied\"you asked or you want ranch?\" I said I asked the waitress. He stormed off. I saw him having attitude with the waitress. It wasn't just this. It was his tone. I asked the waitress why he was so rude and her reply was \"that's Ricardo being Ricardo\" Why have an employee that you can even say that about. Made me very uncomfortable and as a manager of a lounge myself made me realize what people go through just because someone brings their personal life into work. Watch out for Ricardo. Huge tool."}
{"text":"First off, this was not my first time coming here. I have been here about twice before and have enjoyed myself. The fish and chips is the obvious way to go for me, because they have never disappointed. Upgrade to the garlic fries. Garlic + fried potatoes= HEAVEN.  I have tried the tacos, they were ok, I didn't like the double shell with cheese in the middle of them. Neither tortilla shells were good, and stacked together they took away from the inner yumminess of the taco.  Attached are photos from my latest visit; I got the Gorgonzola Pear Salad. It sounded fantastic, but left me disappointed. It had very little pear, Gorgonzola, and blueberries. Plus, it was supposed to be in a Märzen balsamic vinegar ether, but it was SUPER oily and not acidic whatsoever. Also, the chicken was supposed to be pecan-crusted...but there were no pecans to be found. In fact, the chicken my fiancé ordered (Chicken Schnitzel) looked and tasted very similar.  It sounds like they have a great happy hour here, according to other reviews. I expect to come back to try it for myself. I love their beer and their root beer soda. I think I'm going to stick to the fish and chips from now on though."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials!  Located in the nice part of town, right down the block from Tivoli village. Less swanky but still swanky and always fun to people watch. The plastics of SoCal moved here to settle down, due to the lower prices on housing, they spend a higher portion of their incomes on Botox, and fake parts.   I'd been here to this location a couple of times in the last year. Love the specials for happy hour, great deals on appetizers and drinks. I also like to come here for lunch because they have some great healthy but tasty options. During my latest visit, I ordered the Seared Ahi with Quinoa salad. Simple dish, but incredibly tasty! I felt really really good eating it too, and my body thanked me for putting such wonderful nutritious food in it!  I sat at the bar and the bartender was great, really took care of me, my drinks were refilled, food brought out quickly and kept me company as I dined alone. It's very nice! Bathrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"Still pretty dang awesome!   Came to redeem my birthday freebie: buy 1 and get 1 Free entree. The boy was being a prince and didn't want to leave his air-conditioned \"throne room\". So I went to GB to grab dinner for us. Ordered 2 entrees to-go from the hostess. She was very cute, very helpful and radiating positive energy.   Lobster & Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes: just the right amount of seasoning to bring out the essence of quality seafood - 5 stars. The boy wanted his red meat - Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye: the cut was questionable with a lot of fat, but was cooked well. The side of red skin mashed potatoe was pretty tasty - 3 stars.  According to the yelp app, I'm officially a \"regular\". Woohoo!"}
{"text":"The Marzen beer was good and the service was ok but the good ends there. This was the worst veggie burger I've ever had, and soft fast food fries. The bathroom was nasty..that is a sign this GB needs new management. We never go to chains, this trip to GB reminded me why."}
{"text":"Had the Kobey beef cheese burger and it was good! Would recommend it! As a side, had regular fries, I extremely dislike the garlic fries. The server was friendly and did a good job! But by far the best thing was the filet sliders! They were so good, that it made the Kobey burger not taste as great!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Avoid.  Gordon Biersch has always erected serious barriers to entry to drink their \"pretty good\" beers. Most notably the fact that they eschewed the chance to have either a reasonably priced comfort food brewpub or a justified high-end gastropub and just went with big prices and mediocre food. Regardless the main reason to go here is the beer. It's quite solid.  Unfortunately on my latest visit the waitress requested my ID (I am mid thirties have a beard and grey hair. I do not even remotely resemble a 20 year old. I might be a 45 year old.) and it just so happened I forgot it that day. Did Gordon Biersch employ any common sense? No they did not. Was any effort made to placate me in the least? Nope. Did a manager come over and apologize? Nay.  So the only reason to go to GB was taken form me, and thus I had a completely unavoidable, utterly crappy experience. As a corollary I got to experience how utterly mediocre the food is when not under the influence of alcohol. So I guess it's better now that I know the truth."}
{"text":"I love Gordon Biersch but especially love this location. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The private event space is fantastic.   I have dined here many times and have never been disappointed. I have also used the private event space for a number of events. This space in particular is great for a large group of 30+ people. Thank you Gordon Biersch for a wonderful experience. I will continue to come back again and again."}
{"text":"Beer: good There's surely a beer for anyone who like beer on the menu. Nothing wow but decent. Food: average to underwhelming They play it safe with the menu and the flavor. Its over sauced and yet still bland. Service: hit and miss We were treated well enough but it wasn't clear to us or the staff who was waiting our table... it took some time to get sorted."}
{"text":"It was pretty bad. My chicken sandwich tasted like something I would have ordered at a drive through and the cheeseburger lacked any and all flavor. We left hungry and with our bill not reflecting happy hour prices, even sitting in the bar (happy hour area) during happy hour. Service was below par (our waitress was seen just hanging out in a nearby booth while we aimlessly waited for our check for a good 15 minutes. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I asked my conference shuttle driver about this place and he said not to go there for steak.  I received a 10% off coupon from my hotel, and my hotel was close enough, so I went.  BTW, the receptionist was GREAT!  I ordered New York strip (12 oz, med) and a mixed drink.  The steak came out in less than 5 minutes...and before my drink (the server had given me a water).  This was concerning! Well, the drink was good (old fashioned).  The steak was med rare and scrawny (flat, thin and extra skinny). Perhaps the other food is good, but other than conference people (easy to tell because it was on deafness...so signs were flying!) there were only 3 other tables at dinner time.   Another issue was that my server was constantly behind.  I waited about 10 minutes for my check while she talked with a guy staff member by the empty bar.  She was young so I still tipped her OK anyway (not great, but we've all been young and flirty).  All in all I should have went to a place called Flemings where my driver suggested for steak. Improvements: only serve food you do well, don't charge as much as a steak house (for steak) if you can't compete, keep a manager on the floor, and if a conference is in town the staff should know about it and maybe even learn something about that culture if it is so different.  I'm not deaf or hh but I could see that the staff serving those tables had culture shock!"}
{"text":"Great Ahi Tuna Salad! I was thoroughly impressed with their portion sizes and taste factor! Service was a little on the slow side, but really had a great meal. Will visit again."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that Rachel is and will be the only reason I will keep coming back. Her recommendations on point and her attitude the best"}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 star because I truly love the food, but today the service was a little wack.  It all started when I called in to place a togo order and the lady that answered the phone was annoying.  She kept laughing, making it seem that she was not paying any attention to the orders I was giving her and she was paying more attention to the person next to her talking.  She kept asking me to repeat myself when I know I was talking extremely clear and even giving her the K for Kite talk.  When I arrived to pickup the food, the bartender who was the take out food gal kept calling me babe.  I do not think it is professional when you call a customer babe.  My last issue was when I was going through the food to make sure everything was there, I was missing one side of vegetables and the other side of vegetables  was only half full.  I have ordered the side of vegetables many many times and it has always been packed full.  In a calm and friendly voice I asked them to fill the container.  She gave me a \"geez\" kind of look and took the container back to the kitchen but within a few minutes the manager kindly came over and apologized for the lack of vegetables and assured me the problem was being taken care of.   Besides my little setbacks, I love love love this place!  The salmon is cooked perfectly and side of vegetables are spiced just right!  The price for most of the menu is above $10, but well worth the great food you get!   If you want to get a full meal but want to spend under $10, you can get a side of salmon for $5, a side of veggies for $2.95 and a side of rice and beans for $2.25.....Yo u might be the most annoying customer and the cheapest too but it works for me!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out tonight, wish I would have not.  Ordered the steak with garlic mashed and veggies. The steak was okay, the garlic mashed was cold and inedible. The veggies ..OMG YUCK. I never knew you could destroy brussel sprouts like that.  Complete mush, no texture and tasted like sulfur. I have no idea what the other orange mush thing that was with them, but it was also inedible. Definitely will not go back to this place again.  Huge waste of money."}
{"text":"First time at GB. Surprised to be seated right away on a Friday night. I've had their beers before and knew I liked that aspect but boy was I blown away by the service and food! I had the Pub burger and my wife had Seafood Mac and Cheese. I highly recommend both and the Belgian Trippel or Märzen to drink.  Also, the vanilla creme brûlée was outstanding.  Kenneth was our server and was (apparently) new. He was phenomenal. I spoke with the manager on the way out to let him know we'll be back soon. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location quite a few times while on business in Tempe Az. Service is pretty good, food is relatively consistent.  My steak ordered as Med- well came out as rar-med. they fixed it efficiently and I left satisfied.  I usually work a 13 hour day before this visit and it's important to get things right.. recommend!"}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I stopped by here for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu, I decided on the Kobe Sliders, $10.95 that came with a side of Onion Strings.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Sliders were very good....and the Onion Strings were delish!  Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table.  Our Iced Teas and Water glasses were never empty.  Overall, it was a great lunch.  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. Don't get confused by the entrance. Its just a stairwell, the bar is 3 flights up. Our server was really nice and knew her beers. The food here was also on point. The california flat bread, chicken harvest salad, pizza, and chicken blt were all the bomb. Not to mention their garlic fries!!!!! I didn't actually have their beer here, but 3 guys in our group ordered their flights. They were fans of the darker beers. We were a group of 8 and didn't have a reservation, but they seated us right away on a friday night! They also have a lot of flat screen tvs. The place is huge. They have seating indoors and outdoors. A great hang out spot if you ask me."}
{"text":"Really great service. Fish tacos on flour tortillas were wonderful and burgers and beer exceeded expectations. Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location to meet a colleague for a drink.  Had their Hefeweizen.....it was good.  Not the best I've ever had.  i would say this review is incomplete because I only had a drink at the bar.  The staff was pretty friendly, but I didn't have anything to eat and we only hung out at the bar.  I will visit this location again in the future and provide a more detailed review."}
{"text":"Great food! Lots of different varieties of entrees! A little bit pricey. But service is great!  The staff is always very friendly. Jason was our server tonight and every time we come in he takes really good care of us.Always keeps our drinks fill and checks in to make sure everything is great! We will continue to come in because of the service!!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. As soon as we get in, we're seated at a dirty table. Ok, bussers make mistakes and miss a table. Then we sit down and order an appetizer. We are given dirty plates. Then out food comes. Three of us order salads. My pears were brown and still has the stem on them. All of us had witty lettuce. Another had old, smashed blueberries. The appetizer tasted old, like they were frozen and recooked. The patio was filthy. The waitress was very nice, but overall a sad and disappointing experience for the cost of the meal. Not worth going here at all."}
{"text":"Gotta say... great location, great service, and wonderful atmosphere. It's a fine spot with plenty of happy hour specials and a colossal menu. Love the wide open patio space and the huge windows.... you kind of feel outside even if you aren't, which rocks. Tons of natural light.  My girlfriend and I sat down at a bar table and perused the large, large menu. With soooooo many beers and plenty of cocktails, I was super surprised to hear that they didn't carry any ciders at all. What!? Sad... but I ordered a Bloody Mary instead and it was pretty darn good. Nothing super special, but no complaints. I drank it all!  Of course you'll find any kind of appetizer you want here. For real. Nachos, egg rolls, bruschetta, crab cakes, ahi, chips, fries, dips, wings, sliders..... the entrees are just as varied. I wanted to order the tacos which sounded fab, but they only have flour tortillas and no corn substitute. Bummer. It's cool, our waitress knew exactly what was and wasn't GF on the menu. I opted for the Garlic Fries which weren't fantastic, but were indeed covered in plenty of fresh garlic and you can never go wrong there. Yay for horrific breath!  I'd return to Gordon Biersch because it's casual, comfortable, and familiar. Something for everyone, decent prices, and quick friendly service. Nothing too unique or interesting, but a fun time all the same."}
{"text":"6 of us with a 6pm reservation. Seated quickly but that's where quick, fast, or any similar word ended. 1st round of drinks took 20 minutes after ordering. Dinner came out 2 plates at a time with 5-10 minutes in between. Last plate never came (fish and chips). Manager called to table and within another 10 minutes it was delivered. 2nd round of drinks ordered before dinner arrived and never came. Finally had to cancel that order as it was time to go. Management did what they could to comp, etc. but having to pay anything for the poor service received was too much."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get together with some friends and have some beers.  They're apps are decent and their garlic fries will permanently embed and imbue your gums with garlic.  Their menu is pretty average, nothing to write home about and really not worth the price.  So grab a beer or two, have some apps but move on after that."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of this establishment and I appreciate the quality of their beer and the consistency of good service in the bar area. I have only dined in the main seating area twice, and one time it resulted in a beer bath for my wife and infant son but hey, que sera sera right? My overall experience with GB has been positive. Food is good quality but overpriced in my opinion. I tend to take advantage of their happy hour specials if possible. I have had a couple snafus regarding my order, one in particular where my dinner salad came after the entree, but they comped the salad and apologized, no big deal. My go to brew is the hefeweizen, you will not be disappointed with its banana-clovey smoothness. Cheers!"}
{"text":"yes, this is venue #2.... Its a great place to just relax, enjoy a beer balcony-style. Tempe is unique in a way that youre able to sit on a balcony above Mill Ave and watch the people and traffic below.  Im a huge fan of day-drinking... oh wait Im a huge fan of drinking. Especially if i can spit on people."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Gordon B. In Tempe excellent. This one today off Mayo?  Horrible. The hostess clearly does not like her job and with only 5 tables with people in them at 11:45 we still had to wait 25 minutes for 3, cheeseburgers and we had to ask for refills of our drinks. Service was lacking from the time we walked in until we left. Food was excellent wont be back due to lousey service and poor attitudes of staff."}
{"text":"I appreciate the focus on German-style beers but I wasn't blown away. Definitely better than Coors, Miller, or Bud, especially at happy hour prices of $3.75 per pint, but nothing memorably for this self-professed Lover of Beer. Very cool place though and good happy hour deals going on- worth it to try it out, maybe you'll like the beer better than I did."}
{"text":"The Tempe location always has excellent service.  I came here with a group of ladies from work celebrating the holidays during lunch.  Our server was attentive and very accommodating.  All our food and drink orders were right on and she new we were only lunch break so it came out pretty fast.  All our food was excellent, we all enjoyed our selections.  The server had no hesitation about bringing separate checks.  I will suggest Gordon Biersch for more luncheons with our work group in the future."}
{"text":"This GB is one of our favorite places to stop for snack and good seasonal beer.  We try for Sundays to do our shopping in the area and stop here....because it is Happy Hour in the bar area all day long.  Great specials on their beers, wine and appetizers.  We have tried several of their appetizers, but you can't beat their garlic fries here!! YUM-O! Anyhow, the service here is always great.  The hostess, bartenders and waitress are always friendly and ready to take your order.  It is especially nice when the weather is beautiful then they open up the patio/bar area.  Great place to watch games...plenty of TV's.  I frequent the Mill Ave. location, because I work in the area and it does not compare to the San Tan GB."}
{"text":"We went for the first time and it was great the food and entertainment  was wonderful and unexpected  very friendly  atmosphere...Will go again"}
{"text":"I had dinner here over the weekend for the first time. I wouldn't reccomend it for more than maybe the beer and garlic fries. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was probably one of the worst sandwiches I have had. I felt pretty sick the rest of the night. My hubbys burger wasn't wonderful either.   There are tons of places to eat on Mill, next time I know not to stop in here. Oh but I do have to say that our waitress was really friendly and did a great job."}
{"text":"i love the outdoor patio! great service. i can only review the drinks and desserts. the dragonfruit mojito was delish! i heart mojitos. i also had the warm apple bread pudding. it was tasty, not the best bread pudding that i've ever had. would i get it again? prob not. but i would def come back to have dinner sometime."}
{"text":"pretty decent HH. $5 cocktails, lots of cheap eats. came here with some friends after a concert. we shared the southwestern combo that was $11...it came with southwest eggrolls, bbq pork sliders, and garlic fries. we also got the crab and artichoke dip. the food was pretty tasty. i also ordered the firefly tea which was just the right amount of sweet/tea/alcohol. no matter where i am, every gordon biersch location is legit. its always good experience anytime i come here. =)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and well, it's a chain. I don't usually eat here but my husband wanted to go here. Funny enough, he actually wanted to go to BJ's and was confused. He was disappointed because they only have lager here.  Last night we actually had a 5 star experience. Our server Paul was really phenomenal. Got my kids extra fruit, really knowledgeable about beer (my husband loved chatting with him about beer and brewing) and helped me figure out the rewards program. Great service! Food was pretty good too. Hubby got the fish and chips. Fish was breaded with panko and was nice and crispy. Pretty bland though. The garlic fries were really good. I got the cheeseburger with blue cheese. Nothing phenomenal but good.  Unfortunately, I've had a lot of 1 star experiences here and I think that they are a little too expensive for the quality you get,  that I'm giving GB a 3 star overall. Hopefully last night's experience indicates improvement, but it's really a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Worst $90 meal i've ever had. We used to come here quite a bit, but we haven't been here in about 8 months, and Im never going back. My wife ordered a pasta dish, don't remember which one, but I thought she ordered soup with how watery it was. I ordered the 10oz sirloin which I can tell you was no where near 10oz. It was about the size of a 5oz Filet. I even called the waiter over and he tried to tell me that it was 10oz's which is a load of crap when I can eat it in 2 bites. The side consisted of a couple leaves of lettuce and a small handful of fries. I opted to go with the shrimp for 9 bucks more thinking it would be a good 5 shrimp or so. I got 3 medium sized shrimp for 9 bucks. My daughters kids meal wasn't too bad 3 chicken fingers and a pretty good sized bowl of fresh fruit. Otherwise for the 3 of us plus a small desert to share bill came out to $90. Good thing I had gift cards otherwise I would have never paid that for what we got. I see why there was only 1 other table occupied at 7pm in there. The prices are way expensive and portions are way small and I am pretty sure the steak was a bait and switch. If you want a good steak and a cold beer stick with Texas road house and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"After living in this area for so long, I finally tried Gordon Biersch. Of course what intrigued me to come was the happy hour menu. My friend and I came around 10 at night on a Wednesday. There was a private party going on at one side of the bar area so it made it seem sort of packed. Other than that I think the amount of people there was the standard small size crowd for a week night. Unlike Yard House, the happy hour here is only for the bar area. So I guess I can't bring my friends who aren't of age yet.  First we received our drinks, I ordered the Marzen beer and she ordered a mojito.  I'm kind of embarrassed to write this, but I am honestly not a beer drinker and it tasted normal to me?  I only drank a few sips and that was it! hahaha.  I feel like I wasted the other 3/4 that was left. Oh well, good thing we bought it at happy hour price. My friend also said her mojito was just \"okay.\" After she tasted her drink she wished she had the Dragon fruit strawberry mojito which sounded 10 x better than the boring classic. As for the food, we ordered the Southwest Combo and calamari. I really enjoyed the garlic fires because of the Parmesan cheese and the garlic flavored oil drizzled on top. I also thought the calamari, was pretty standard. However, I am not a fan of the other items that came with the Southwest Combo. The egg rolls was on the verge of having soggy wrapper and the pork sliders were nothing special. We order the mini warm apple bread pudding for dessert. It was delicious especially the contrast of textures and flavors between the bread, caramel, and apple. If you want dessert but don't have enough room for a normal size one, the mini is perfect. I really want to come here again to try other items on the HH menu, but I don't know if it's worth it knowing other places (ie Yard House) have better selection, quality, and prices. Therefore 3 stars."}
{"text":"So we went to see the Trans-Siberian-Orchestra at the Glendale Arena Complex.  Gordon Biersch was a mad house but we had made reservations and were seated on time. There was a one hour wait for those who hadn't. However, those who had these special \"Passport\" memberships got bumped to the head of the line. Anyway like all event related establishments it cleared out quickly after the rush had settled.  However, we waited an hour after sitting to get our food, and even then it didn't show up all at once.  The poor waiter kept apologizing to not only us but everyone saying they had been backed up in the Kitchen quite a bit, to which a regular customer doesn't understand if he/she sees not many people around. I ordered the Chicken Marsala, which was good except the pan fried noodles it came with were way too oily! After complaining we got our whole ticket comped except one drink, total bill for 4 people was $6.75! I certainly would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are going to a game.  The ambience was great, plenty of outdoor seating, the beer fantastic (I had an excellent Maarzen) but the traffic lines, the mad rush of the event crowd and the relatively small kitchen make this place unsuitable for proper entertaining and dining."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers!! Its big...and its loud..and its Vegas' version of Socal's BJs!! Yay for BJs...wait...no...i don't think i meant it like that!! Sick little minds..."}
{"text":"Must try the shrimp and lobster mac & cheese!! It is the only reason I am giving three stars.   I wasn't too impressed by the Kobe burger.  I asked for it cooked medium but it was charred well done and very dry. The service was good - prompt and attentive.     I'd go back for that Mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"We used to live right by Mayo and we had driven past this place at least 100 times. On a whim we decided to stop in for a late dinner. We stopped in on a Thursday and they had some good taco specials going on. For a little later in the evening I was surprised at how busy it was. We grabbed a spot on the patio and nestled in under a heater which was perfectly fine.  We both got a beer flight which I love because it gives you an opportunity to try out different beers within a reasonable amount. They had a good selection so I recommend giving this a try if you decide to stop in.   I ordered the California beach tacos which were fried cod and my husband ordered the beef sliders. The fish tacos were very good, I am a sucker for a good fish taco and these were pretty darn tasty. We also split the cheese curds with bacon which you can't go wrong because...bacon. My husband said the sliders were good but nothing out of the ordinary.   They have a large menu so we will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down, this place is absolutely awesome!  Our waiter was super helpful and made us feel right at home ( I wish I could remember his name to give him the shout out he deserves) and added to the whole experience of this brewery.    Everything we ordered (minus the lobster bisque - which I sent back) was to die for.  Try the blue crab and artichoke dip when your go in!    I will definitely be coming back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"i'm super conflicted on this review. i joined about 40 others for a surprised party at gordon biersch on saturday night. our party was tucked in the back corner on the east side of the bar. the space had an adjacent patio, which i thought was really cool. until the hostesses started seating guests that were not part of our party on that patio.   on one hand, service at the bar was most excellent. each time i trotted up i had, within seconds, another light beer was in my hand - that means i have one happy husband, so naturally, i was stoked. bartender was happy to refill my water and give me a fresh lemon wedge (hey someone's got to drive right?!).  on the other hand, i found it odd that the restaurant chose to walk other guests through the party to the patio ... i really felt for those people. our party of 40+ was crammed into a small space to begin with, and on top of that hostesses were leading diners through the crowd to seat them at patio tables. i understand patio = prime seating, but pushing your way through a crowd to get to it isn't appetizing. the party area was so small i couldn't have gotten to the food display if i wanted to - there were way too many people in our small space. if the restaurant had decided to allow our party to use the patio (which only had 4 tables on it to begin with) i think the other diners and our party would have been much more comfortable.   in my mind, all this comes together as a 2 star review, with no disrespect intended for the fantastic bartender."}
{"text":"Beers: the Märzen wasn't bad;  flavor was ok, falls flat pretty quickly.  I tried a taste of the SommerBrau; not a fan, too light and floral for my tastes.    Food was good.  I ordered the crab artichoke dip.  The dip was good but the toast points were a bit stale.  I had a chicken avocado sandwich; delicious  Our server was great, VERY attentive.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back, hopefully they will have the IPA on tap next time."}
{"text":"This location is huge! We stopped in before a concert for some pre-drinks and appetizers. There was a bit of a wait as to be expected but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time.  Service was friendly and beer was cold. Food was delivered to our table hot and we never felt rushed considering the crowds waiting to be seated.  A solid 3 star A-Ok!  Good for HH and large groups."}
{"text":"First time eating there and it was a huge disappointment from the moment we walked in.  We were a group of 6.  Someone tried to lead us to a small rectangle table in the darkest area of the restaurant....I said no thanks, we'd rather have one of the round tables in the light, bright area.  We were early 11:30 am so the lunch \"crowd\" hadn't arrived yet.  Of course I ordered the wrong item.  I selected what they called the seafood salad plate.  It consisted of a HUGE amount of lettuce, a few tiny canned shrimp and perhaps two tablespoons of crab salad....some chopped up cucs and a sliced egg...small chopped up tomatoes.  All this for $14.99. Never again!"}
{"text":"I typically love this place.  Now, came for lunch. Couldn't order a small order of garlic fry's. Ok. Then placed order and after waiting 35 minutes my salad was horrible!  Thankfully they took it off my bill.  I probably won't be coming back for quite some time. Dissatisfied is an understatement."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We loved the blue crab and artichoke dip. I ordered the Cajun pasta, it was good, but my fiancé's lobster and shrimp tacos were out of this world. I also ordered a drink called the French 75 (or something like that) it was super light and refreshing. I'd totally come back to this place."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful. We had to take advantage of outdoor seating on one of the few under 100* days in July. There were only two of us, but the place looks like it could handle a football team coming thru. To sum it up: great atmosphere, the beer was refreshing, and service was great. The food could use some creativity.... But who am I to judge"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever and I have to say the food was better than I thought it was going to be I had had the lump crab and ordered the Cajun pasta. My kids ordered the cheeseburger and fries and also had a couple of the alcohol drinks.   The lump crab was so good and the tarter sauce that went with it was great. I really enjoyed the Cajun pasta that I hate the whole bowl and the portion size was huge. The kids meals were OK  have seen and had better. Loved the variety of alcohol they had. The bar area and restaurant itself was nice.The prices were a little high but it was worth it! Service was friendly, fast and I  definitely will be back to try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I was stoked to see a San Diego based business follow me to Las Vegas.  But sadly, the food is average and so is the beer.  It's near my house, so I'll go every so often, but it has earned the nickname Garlic Biersch at my house for their tendency to put garlic on EVERYTHING!  The bar and patio are a cool hang-out spot, though."}
{"text":"Stopped in because every place else was busy - the ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and the service was great!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their beer is great but more than a few times during heavy traffic they run out of their more popular drafts.  I always sit at the bar so I'm not sure what \"bad service\" other people have gotten as the bartenders are always friendly.  They have a pretty early reverse happy hour but I only show up when I just want a beer on the way home, the place is usually kind of dead tbh and there really isn't too many people here after 6pm, I could be mistaken but that's just what I've seen in the dozen or so visits I've made here.  It's more of an upscale vibe so it's alot of 40+ y.o. executive types here, I'm probably the youngest person in the bar being in my 20s.  Due to their upscale menu, solid craft beer brewed in house (I love their red ale) it gets 4 stars.  See picture for their happy hour menu, Tuesday $3 beer is a steal!!"}
{"text":"To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery.   First of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time.    When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered.   As a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.  At this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried:   Beer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a \"Cajun roumalade\"--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.  Marzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference.   Steak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach.   Other people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head.   For a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price."}
{"text":"Went here with husband for some drinks at happy hour. We asked about the specials and were told about the specials on beers and martinis. I am not sure what the happy hour prices were but lets just say that the martinis were $5, according to our waitress. I asked what kind of martinis they had and decided on the lemon something or other. My husband ordered the house brew that was recommended by the server.  When the drinks came mine was very yummy. The husband took a nice big drink and thought it was yummy too ( not his words, though). After he put the glass down after taking a drink I noticed that there was some things floating in the glass. We were not sure what it was...it looked like just a bunch of debris floating around. He almost lost it. We showed the server and she was very sorry and returned with a new one. I ordered 2 martinis and he finished his beer and did not feel like having another so we asked for the bill. When I looked on the bill I noticed that the drinks were not the prices that she had stated when we came in and aasked about the specials. The beers was $2 more than she quoted...and my martinis were not $5...they were $9.50. Just at that moment the manger came by and asked how we were doing, I asked about the bill and was told that the happy hour price was for a smaller glass than what my husband had and that only the house martinis were $5 and mine were not house martinis.   When the husband ordered the beer he asked what is the happy hour special...what do you recommend...and that is what she brought. Same thing about the martinis. I felt schwindled. He adjusted it. Thanks .  We did not order any food, but the menu was very pricey. That better be some good eats!!!"}
{"text":"Took the waiter over 15 minute to check on us initially. Then to check back on us took an additional 10 to 15 minutes and then to come back to take the order took 10 more minutes. Our table was even located right next to the waiter station area and he would walk by us every two minutes and we even tried to get his attention and he didn't pay much attention to us. We had to asked for napkins, silverware and refills and then finally the check. They are super stingy on their french fries the came with about 25 fries, if that. My house made tacos were more like a salad. There was more lettuce and a few crumbs of fish on the top like if they were bread crumbs. This was my first and last visit here. In this era of Millennials except more the first time or there is no second chance, they need to improve a lot or they will be closed in the near future. Oh and they do not validate the parking."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Service was decent but very slow until the end. Lindsey dropped off my check without asking me if I wanted anything else, nor after sitting on the check for about 15 minutes, did she come back over to see if there was something else I needed. Why does this always happen when I am dining solo? Not happy at all :-("}
{"text":"It was a gorgeous night to dine in on the patio at Gordon Biersch. The restaurant was clean and the ambiance good. Our waitstaff was fantastic and attentive.  The calamari appetizer was tasty, but rubbery and overdone. The drink selection was great.  I had a strawberry soda, which was refreshing and crisp. Our table had the peppered tuna, sirloin tips, gorgonzola chicken and lobster & shrimp Mac and cheese. The entrees were abundant, well prepared and displayed and were flavorful.   I was a bit disheartened to see that the menu was different than the website. We went with a prechosen dinner selection that was sadly abandoned when our options weren't on the menu.  I had read on other reviews that the menu changes often.  This is sad, since repeat customers don't appreciate that...if their favorites are around long enough that they chose to come back.  We will return to Gordon Biersch in the future."}
{"text":"I come here often as it's not too far from where I work.  Most of the items on the menu are good, but nothing yet that has blown my taste buds away.  The service has always been great and the atmosphere is good.     Out of all the different items I have tried, I would have to say that the salads they offer are their most unique tasting dish."}
{"text":"Culinary sin.  You dont put uncooked garlic on a plate   Fries tasted good but the uncooked garlic was unacceptable.   Had kobe beef burger.  It was under seasoned proportionally to the over seasoned fries.  Really im biening nit picky would eat again but would request some changes with the chef"}
{"text":"Maybe the third or fourth time I've been to this restaurant  - this time for a birthday. Reminded again that the only real reason to come is for the beer. Obviously, it's a brewery, but the food seems sub par to others even though they try.   The setting itself is nice and clean. Service was excellent for our party of 15.   While acceptable for the occasional dinner event it's not something I would recommend to eat. Strictly just for the social drinking aspect in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! No food, only drinks. We ordered the milk stout and a sampler. The milk stout was thin, almost watery; and more burnt than dark. Really disappointing. The sampler was the smarter order as our friend liked the wiezenboch and the heffenwiezen so he had four ounces of beer he liked. The service makes us want to give the food a try, but the beer makes that not likely."}
{"text":"Something about this place makes me want to hate it. But it's always come through for me. I always find a beer that fits my mood. And the few times I couldn't agree with a beer they replaced it free if charge! The food also never disappoints. It's pretty good. Maybe slight pricey, but not bad. And the happy hour entrées are great and priced well. When the weather is right, the patio is no doubt the best place to hang and people watch."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, ambiance was good, and our food was great.  They had plenty of gfree options as well."}
{"text":"This is my bi-weekly business luncheon group at Gordon Biersch. I enjoy the room they set up for us,service and the menu they provide. The staff is always helpful and friendly, I enjoy Octavia the hostess very professional and kind.   I truly enjoy the food and the service! On of my colleagues informed my that they have a wonderful brunch service."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service. My husband and I sat in the bar area during happy hour last night. We ordered our drink and food together. It took 10 minutes before someone brought the drink, which ended up getting delivered to the table next to us. The waiter was quick to bring us a new one, but my husband was annoyed that the waiter announced to the table next to us that they got a free beer. Then another waiter brought our food to the exact same table that our original beer went to! Luckily, the people next to us stopped him before he placed it on their table. Then our original waitress asked us if we needed anything. I asked for Parmesan cheese for pizza and ketchup for fries, but then she went to tend other tables before bringing those items. We waiting about 5 minutes and I was getting ready to go up to the bar for ketchup and napkins when she finally came with shredded mozzarella cheese and ketchup. We wanted to order another drink and dessert, but based on the service we experienced so far, felt it would be risky. So we cut our dinning experience short and asked for the check. When we got the check, we found that we had been double charged for the beer, so we were basically being asked to not only pay for the late beer, but also the \"free\" one the other table got. The waitress fixed the bill (removing the second beer), we paid, and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"My BF and I were in town for the Insight Bowl, won by ISU!!!  We were searching the Mill Ave seen, near the ASU campus and decided to try GB.  We've gone by the one in SD, but never tried it, so this was a good chance.  The beer was fantastic!!  Neither one of us is a big beer drinker, so we tried the Golden Export, there mildest brew!  It was easy to drink and the flavor of the hops came out.  We were told they could be bought in bottles at Bev Mo...TBD.  As for dinner, I had the Jambalaya with orza pasta and my BF had the Flat Iron steak.  The jambalaya was good, the sausage was tasty, tho the chicken and shrimp weren't.  It was hard to see since the lighting was dim.  I definitely think this dish would have been better with rice!  My BF didn't finish his rice and gave some to me to mix it in with mine and it gave it much more texture, the the pasta.   His steak was cooked right (well for him!) and fairly tender tho there were some tough sectiions.  We will try the one in SD for sure, maybe just for the beer and happy hour!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Gordon Biersch over the weekend. I came with some girls for their happy hour 3-6 on Saturday but we got there around 2pm. I ordered a vodka soda (small for $6) and it was the same price on happy hour. I had their spin dip and egg rolls. Both were delicious. I think we were a bit rowdy for the setting but our waitress was super sweet. I will definitely come back to check out their dinner menu, everything just seems a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go here a lot for beers and enjoy the atmosphere in the bar area.  Their beers are all pretty decent especially the Marzen.  The food is really enjoyable.  I actually wish I came here to eat instead of drink to try more things on the menu.  I love the garlic fries.  The lobster bisque is also excellent as well as the southwest egg rolls.  I've had some burgers and other stuff on the menu all of which were good.    It is really only missing some dish on the menu that you absolutely have to go there and get again."}
{"text":"I don't see why everyone is giving this place 3 stars. Service was excellent. Food was delicious. The beer is very very good. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I dont totally understand how you do last call 40 minutes before close  ... The bar tender was rude to our server (who was awesome.. Our server was awesome, bar tender was a jerk sandwich ) and was more concerned with getting home on time than actually serving people.  Close at 1 last call at 12:20? On mill ..."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and both my wife and I ordered pint sized beers (listed as 16.5 Oz on their menu).  When the beers arrived, they seemed a bit small for a pint.  The beer glasses had .4 litre etched on them.  The conversion of .4 litre to fluid ounces is 13.5 ounces, NOT 16.5 AS LISTED ON THE MENU! I pointed this out to our server who AGREED that .4 litre is only 13.5 ounces, but gave some lame reason that these were the glasses that they were told to use as pints. If you order a pint beer here, insist that you actually get a full 16 ounces!"}
{"text":"Overall, nothing spectacular, nothing horrendous. The usual brew pub type fare: sliders, fried foods, salads with lots of dressing. Prices range from $5 for apps to $11 for entrees. I came here for happy hour due to the fact their happy hour lasts to 7 pm, a huge plus. The service started off a little spotty, but ended up to be good.   Solid food, decent prices and services. Would definitely return especially if it after normal happy hour times."}
{"text":"I went to the place with my fiancé and for the first time going, it was not great at all! The patio area and the front were filled with people. For some reason or another, the hostess seats is in the VERY BACK (two booths away from the kitchen). Really?! What the hell was the point of that when there were absolutely NO other patrons seated there? That alone was enough to make me walk out and not even try the items that looked good from previous customers. Totally unacceptable to do that to a customer. I will not return nor do I recommend this place. I only gave it one star be us you have to rate it. I can't wait for Yelp to have MINUS star ratings because this is what this place needs."}
{"text":"went once and that was enough for me. the waitress was snotty and not at knowledgeable-when asked if the seasonal brew was hoppy, she said no and looked at me like i was crazy. the beer was extremely hoppy, of course. she ignored us once she found out we weren't ordering food and the beer was mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"The good news is the chef or whoever pretends to do that can't screw up the beer. The food is another story. Lunch pulled pork sliders actually made me ill. Lukewarm congealed pulled pork (probably from a huge days old refrigerated batch) concoction on nondescript rolls with a strange onion? pile of something on the middle of plate. Not cheap either. I'd recommend you go down the street a block to Brio."}
{"text":"The bartender was kind and funny. I had the spicy chicken lettuce wraps. Delicious!  My husband had the blackened fish sandwich and it was very plain. The fries were good and the beers was awesome. The vibe was chill, loved there decor and will def go back during happy hr."}
{"text":"Great location! The bar seating is good, TV's everywhere.  Great service! The grilled ahi tacos are fab.  I'll be back for those."}
{"text":"I woul not normally do this I am not a big yelper but I feel that maybe this is the only way to get them to respond. I sent this Tuesday its thursday and no response very unprofessional I guess  I  am a disposable customer   Dear William Richard Wylie,  We received your contact information as follows:  Topic: Restaurant Experience Visit Rating: Bad Visit Date: 03/28/17 Restaurant: scottsdale Name: William Richard Wylie Email: wrwylindulge@gmail.com Should Contact: Yes  Comments: Today at 11:45 a.m. I arrived at your unit in Scottsdale Arizona no one was at the hostess stand 3 minutes later i was approached by a server no smile no welcome to Gordon Biersch nothing. Plopped my menu down on the table and said the server will be right there. The server came up no smile asked me if \" I wanted something to drink\" no upsell suggestion or anything. I ordered a coke. She asked if I needed more time I said yes. Then she came back and siad if I was ready to order I said no she said and I quote:You need to decide so we can get your order in because I have a large group and I wont be able to attend to you. I noticed other servers putting out plastic cups of beer everyone attending the big party comming in, My question is this were you not ready to attend the party and other guests, Are big parties that are problably tourist that come once a year more impor tant to the guest that could come all year and be a repeat guest not that either one is more important but should be equally important. I have been in this buissness 35 years and i have never received such an form of service before. Frankly I was taken affront by the attitude and poor service etiquette that I received form both employees.I decided to pay for my drink and leave, I felt pressured to order to do it before the Big party came in and someone would be unable to attend to my needs also. I feel when you go out to eat you should be made to feel special, like your the only one there have a good experience not only with the food and drink but also the service. I feel that I have many choices and I choose Gordon Biersch But I was extremely let down. As I was walking out I asked for the MOD and The Executive Kitchen Manager came out i explained my problem he listened and asked me to stay and they would take care of me and to lets start over, unfourtunatley at that point i had los t my appetite. I didn't expect a Comp to make things better I expect a solution to the problem, I come form the old school if you see a problem fix it right away. They way it should be done, This unit dropped the ball. It was my first visit ever to your concept and although I didn't eat it left a terrible taste in my mouth. my number is 602-516-8419 Sincerly Richard Wylie C.E.C C.I.E.C"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the service. Place was not too busy but took forever to get and when I did get my food it was made wrong. So took even longer to get correct.  Atmosphere is nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"I attended a business luncheon in the meeting room in the back. I ordered a Chicken Cashew Salad. It was really tasty but seemed like the portion was quite dainty. Perhaps they were telling me I didn't look hungry or maybe that I didn't need the calories..... Either way, I was still a little hungry by the time I had finished scraping the plate. In addition, two of the folks who ordered burgers didn't get them until everyone else was nearly done eating and it was a fixed menu. In fairness, there were about 20 or so people there and the server made sure our beverages were plentiful."}
{"text":"Waited almost 30 minutes to initially get waited on at our table outside. Gave us waters without asking. People that got seated after us got served their beers before us. Got our burger 30 mins after and still no beers.... Server blamed bartender for being \"backed up\". It's a Wednesday night and it's not even half way packed. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Nice restaraunt tucked away. Its actually a really huge place. Lots of seating and large bar area. There were big screens with the golden knights playing. For a Thursday night, the place was pretty packed, but there was no wait. We just missed happy hour that ended at six, which was kind of a bummer. The cucumber tom collins was great. Light, refreshing, and sweet. Still had a kick too. Our server recommended it.  Blue crab artichoke dip was amazing! Chunks of real crab meat and hot cheesy goodnes. Theres not nearly enough pita and crackers, but the server noticed half way through and offered additional which we of course jumped on. The seafood cobb was crisp, fresh, and full of fresh tender crab and shrimp. The jalapeno ranch was thick, and rich with a hint of smokiness. Steak was decent size and cooked perfect, nice flavor. Veggies not overcooked just the right crunch. The only thing that was missing was a good dessert. They didnt have much of a variety and nothing really appealed to me."}
{"text":"Good experience......i had the BBQ chicken sandwich which was outstanding! Not sure how they got such great grilled smoked flavor but it was great  the garlic fries were also good and 100 octane! My wife had the schnitzel and it disappeared in minutes. My only gripe is how small the portion of fries was. Skimpy... Their house light beer was also very good."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst restaurant experiences we had ever had the restaurant was not busy when we arrived the service was horrible the food was served cold and then to top off the evening we both got food poisoning we have been down now for 2 days with this Not fun I will never ever ever go back to this place"}
{"text":"I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there aren't many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza."}
{"text":"The cream wheat beer was very good and so was the ham and gruyere flatbread sandwich with fries. Service was good and I'd like to return for happy hour."}
{"text":"It's a dark chilis that's, however when you walk in if you don't fit their standard be prepared to get the \"glare\".  The hostess were cold and seemed as though they had better things to do.. our service started out slow but our server ended up taking good care of us overall and is the only reason I would probably try it again. Food was good and served promptly. The hostesses need to be retrained on how to treat guests when they walk in to a restaurant. I felt as though from the second me and my family walked in they treated us as though we didn't belong instead of greeting us with a smile. The world has changed, people that wear suits now work for the people who wear pajamas."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Gordon Biersch's was Great! We really had a good time enjoying their food and great service. The Veggie Pizza was so good and their Garlic Fries I'd ordered didn't last long at all. They seasoned the fries so good I almost licked the plate but held back, we must act civil in public...right? I would definitely recommend this place for people that just want to go out and have a good tasty meal with a slue of great tasting beers to choose from. The also had a bar section which was adjacent from the dining area. You could hear the music just enough to where it wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"We actually wanted to go to the Yard House but decided to try Gorden Biersch instead and we definitely had a good time there. We were there around lunch time and the restaurant wasn't that busy yet. We started off with their beer sampler for $6. It was a lot of fun to try all of those different beers. The hefeweizen was definitely my favorite.  We then ordered the fish tacos with a side of seasonal vegetables and a chicken sandwich with a side of their garlic fries. The portions were big and we were actually full after sharing the fish tacos and drinking all that beer. The tacos were very good and came in a crunchy taco that was hugged by a soft taco. Inside was the grilled fish, salsa, and a remolade sauce. The garlic fries were very good, as well.   All in all we had a very good experience. Service seemed a little slow, considering my husband ordered another beer and we watched it sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes. Other than that, I'm sure we will be back.."}
{"text":"I had a pretty terrible experience today!  First me and my friend walked in and requested to sit outside on the patio since it was a beautiful day, the hostess told us to go ahead and seat ourselves, no problem. We went to go sit at a table and the party in front of us received menus and the hostess completely forgot to give us some and had no intentions on returning with any menus. We sat and waited for a few minutes then a busy server saw us getting impatient and grabbed us menus. We wanted cocktails and an appetizer but it took a while for the server to return. After about 10 minutes waiting to even see the server after receiving the menus we place our entire order. Things were going fine after that, food came out in a timely manner and was pretty tasty. Then I was pretty disgusted with what happened next, the hostess was walking around the patio, grabbed a full glass of water from a dirty table and gave it to my friend thinking she was doing her a favor by refilling her water!!! GROSSS! We decided not to make a big deal but when telling the server about it, he seemed to not even care and made it seem like we were crazy. We then finished our food and left. Probably never going back there again. Terrible service and all the staff seemed like they hated life. Not good!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda disappointed that this place has no five stars. I really liked it and here's why:  Food. Delicious in every aspect. My wife and I shared the garlic fries. I was not expecting so much garlic but they turned out great. Our meals were equally satisfying. (Pictures posted)  I ordered the schwarzbier, being a big fan of trying new beers. And I figured it was a brew house so why not. Easily one of the best I've ever had.   Price. I expected the price to be a bit high. It was, but for the price I can say it was worth it.   Ambience. Fresh. Modern. Clean.   Service. Here's the only disappointing part about our visit. The waitress talked very little to us and hardly spared a smile. She was not rude per se, but not overly friendly. It was not enough to damper my experience.   Overall. I can't say the trip was perfect, but l was very satisfied with GB and will return in the future."}
{"text":"We had the variety sample of beer. Great way to get to know their beers.The benefit of going there is the birthday desert. or entree when already signed up. The best reviews suggested the garlic fries. good for appetizer. our entree, seafood linguini, was big enough to share, we added a salad, and for desert, the apple, cherry crepe. small but tasty. The staff were generous with their knowledge of the menu, recommending what was popular."}
{"text":"I have to give this place at least 4 stars based on their service alone.  This week was only my 3rd time here in the last 2 years, but everytime I've been treated pretty good.  A couple of things first, it's always been on the weekdays, happy hour, and I always sat at the bar.    I've usually just have the HH food (i.e. sliders, fries, etc).  All are good, but nothing that sets them apart.  It's cheap though.  I recently tried the crab stuffed yellow tail.  Got to say, pretty good stuff.    Usually came out here to drink and can never complain about their selection.  Not too busy for a Gordon Biersch.  My 4 rating is mainly for the service, ambience, and beer.  For a restuarant somewhat close to the strip, you get that mix of the \"Vegas Baby\" crowd and locals."}
{"text":"Gorgonzola rib eye was excellent. Great service and good selection of drinks. Always worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great beer, good menu, and friendly service. Yum."}
{"text":"Bottom line:  go for the beer and atmosphere, don't eat here.  I've eaten at the GB in DC and had high expectations of GB Las Vegas - but was very disappointed.  My friends had the pasta and red sauce and indicated that they could still taste the ketchup in the sauce.  Another friend had the tempura shrimp and chicken that was good in portion, but lacking in flavor.  I had the equivalent of chicken Marsala.  Portions were small - 3 pieces of chicken slightly bigger than a silver dollar and less than a quarter inch in thickness.  Complimenting the chicken was a scoop of potatoes and another helping of squash.  My dinner was small, lacked flavor and cost $29 - not including beer.  My buds and I were still hungry after 'dinner' so we went to BK to satisfy our hunger.  Beer was good.  GBs marzen is the closest brew I've found that rivals real German marzens.    No kidding - save your money.  Go for the beer and atmosphere.  Have an appetizer, but don't go for dinner."}
{"text":"First restaurant I tried when I arrived in Tempe on Sunday night.  I just needed a snack and a beer so I had a seared ahi app.  It was good but not great.  The beer was also good, but was warm by the time it came to the table.  I was with a group of 6 and everyone else said the same.  Our server must have been having a rough time, even though it wasn't busy at all.  He was doing everything but helping us.  Took 15 minutes for us to be greeted at the table, then the food took far too long (maybe 30 minutes or more) and then he never checked back on us during the meal and after being there for over an hour we had to get up, go get him to get the check... where he was socializing with a coworker while washing windows.  I'm all for a clean restaurant but come on man... washing windows instead of taking care of your guests?  That's just ridiculous.  Prioritize dude... prioritize.  We talked about how hilarious that was for 3 days while we were in town."}
{"text":"I had been to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe several times before going to this one in GIlbert. I'm not sure I was ever in love with their food (or their microbrew), but the atmosphere in Tempe was always very upbeat and lively, which made it a destination to go out for dinner on a weekend night. But, at this location, it is much quieter, leaving you with only the food and drinks... which aren't anything more special than something along the lines of a Chilis... but, everything is more expensive.   Bottomline: I'd go back if someone else wanted to go, but it wouldnt be a place I would pick myself. Not terrible, but not worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I've been to GB many times and nearly always have a good experience.  They have quite a solid menu all around.  I really enjoy their SW eggrolls, garlic fries, burgers, chicken pesto pasta, pizzas, and steaks.  The deserts are very delicious.  Portions are typically pretty generous and quality is consistently good.  If you want to go for a beer and appetizer, GB is a really good choice as well.  Their brews are good, they have a lot of happy hour specials to choose from, and the bar area has a good ambiance.  They always have good tunes playing and several HD screens with various sports on.  This is one of my favorite chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent once again, wife had the beef tips and I had the beer mushroom chicken, awesome after we had the mushroom fritters for an appetizer which where also awesome,golden export and strawberry soda cold as always , walk the extra block away from westgate it's well worth it"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. The food never disappoints. This time I tried their veggie burger made out of beans with sweet potato fries. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love their garlic fries and southwest egg rolls. Their beers are pretty tasty as well. I usually opt for whatever their seasonal is (right its the SummerBrau- nice and light)."}
{"text":"Great local beer and a talented brewer. The food is well planned and tasty.  My favorite was the burger with bacon jelly and the Marback!"}
{"text":"The way I would describe this place is like B.J's brewhouse and restaurant. Similar vibe, have their own craft beers, and food selection. I got the dark porter beer and paired it with the Kobe beef black and bleu burger and the legit garlic fries. Get it medium well to get the best taste out of the Kobe beef. Aside from the beef, the burger itself was actually not very well seasoned. Either season the beef patty really well or compensate with flavorful ingredients on the burger, such as the choice of cheese and sauces. Aside from that it was a decent burger. Unfortunately I got my fries when they were cold so probably not a good representation. I will have to try it again. It would be amazing if they had special dipping sauce to complement the fries. The porter beer was not bad in my opinion. Obviously it's not the greatest, but decent. Apparently this place has a great happy hour with both the drinks and appys, which is legit. Overall, great place to hang out with friends and have some craft beers!"}
{"text":"Great service.  If you're not sure what kind of beer to get, they will bring you a sample to make sure.  We love everything from the salad to the burgers and fish and chips for lunch.  Very good sangria."}
{"text":"I stayed across the street from this restaurant for a few days and wound up having a few different meals here. The food I had - some sliders, a spinach salad, and a pulled port sandwich - was all delicious. The prices were a little on this high side, but nothing unreasonable or unexpected for the area.  The beers were a little uninspiring, but it's possible that my bar is set too high for mass-produced microbrews. I recommend the Marzen and the Schwarzbier - definitely the two best ones of the bunch.  I enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely go back if it was so convenient - but I'm not sure it's really worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start with this. My rating level fluctuated all night due to a variety of influences, but I wound up being \"a fan\" by the end.  The service was pretty mediocre. Yeah, it was busy since it was St. Patrick's Day and a Saturday night to boot, but I still have reasonable expectations. It seemed like forever for them to bring food out, and my friend's whiskey on the rocks took way longer than the other drinks for no good reason. We also had to ask twice for the vegetarian menu, and this was for the birthday boy no less. Finally, it took them forever for them to bring us our check even though it was clear that we had finished our food. You know, based on them clearing out our empty plates and whatnot.  However, I did enjoy my half-liter (standard size, apparently) of Marzen beer, and the food was pretty decent (but nothing special) overall. My kobe burger was nothing special, so I'd recommend that you pick one of the other burgers instead. The garlic fries were delicious though, the fish portion of the fish and chips was really nice, and the potato chips nacho appetizer that my friends were sharing wasn't bad.  Even so, this would probably be a three-star review if it wasn't for one thing: they had my Sharks game playing on TV. We were playing the Red Wings, and a couple of their fans just so happened to be sitting near our section and had the TV tuned in to the game. Now this happened to be on the NBC Sports Network and wasn't a legit regional broadcast, and it wasn't in HD for whatever reason, but I'm still very happy that I caught the game because we won in overtime and managed to climb back into position for a playoff spot down the stretch.  I don't think I'd pick this place over Yard House if I had the choice in the future, but I still had a good time here, and I think most people can enjoy this place too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is somewhat ok, the venue is nice and there is plenty of space for diners, however my main disappointment came with the food. I ordered a Kobe Beef Cheeseburger and Lobster Bisque. The Lobster Bisque was forgotten until the entrée came out, which was already disappointing, but I shrugged that off. Next, the Kobe Burger came out severely different to what I ordered. I had asked for a medium rare and the burger came out medium well to almost well done. For a \"Legendary Restaurant\", it's disappointing how you can even mess up the burger. We also ordered some of their garlic fries. Sadly enough, I was also disappointed from those as well. While they were tasty, they lacked the basic seasoning such as salt and pepper. I would be willing to give them a second chance, however if I intend to go back in the near future, I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Beers on the patio   Working out a place to have a beer with a few friends after work we stopped by for a few cold ones at Gordon's.  The menu has a nice extensive beer range with beers on draft and bottle. They also have some great beers that are company brewed. The brown ale they have has a great taste and is highly recommended.  The layout has a great seating area at the rear for groups with the center containing booths and tables for 4. The bar and high top seating complements the front of house with a great patio that can be awesome on a nice warm night.  I have eaten here once before grabbing a GB cheeseburger, as I remember it being  a great tasting burger that was extremely satisfying. The fries that came with the burger were a little dried out and a little tasteless.  High chairs available with a little kids menu to go with.  Overall  Good service  Clean business  Decent food Great beer"}
{"text":"Every beer tastes the same, just a different color. It's like they use the same yeast strain and just different grains for every beer. Food is basic and over priced. Do yourself a favor and go to State 48 Brewery or Saddle Mountain and support the locally owned places. This place is basically the Applebee's of the brewery world."}
{"text":"Love taking my daughter for lunch here.  We like the patio, food is good , servers Miss Jersey , Mattie, were great  ,"}
{"text":"The service at this location is truly sub-par.  I went here before the Radiohead concert, which was sold out, and the restaurant was very busy. I hate to be overly critical of the service at restaurants when they're slammed, but I felt the delays here were beyond what is expected.  We were told the wait time would be 35 minutes, but it was really 45. This is one of my biggest pet peeves--I feel a restaurant should never underestimate wait times, so that customers can make an informed decision about whether to wait or not.   One of the diners in my party is a vegetarian, and ordered a veggie burger. Thirty minutes after we placed our order, the server came back and told her the restaurant was out of veggie patties.  I can see no reason why the restaurant would not have discovered this for thirty minutes, other than that the restaurant did not start to prepare our order for thirty minutes. It then took about another thirty minutes for our food to come. I think it's unexcusable for a restaurant to take sixty minutes to serve food to customers once they're seated, no matter how busy. However, the beer here is always delicious, and the food is fine."}
{"text":"Came down to meet a friend who was watching the game. Really big place which helps keep the noise level down.  We sat at the bar the gentleman sitting next to us offered to move over so we had enough seats.   I am not a big beer drinker but since it is a brewery I had to get one!  I got a Hefeweizen I like the citrus hint in this beer.  The standard beer size is a half pint that seemed about right for me perfect size.   We had the Crab stuffed shrimp very delicious.  I love love love crab cakes and this was close to that but even better because it is stuffed in a shrimp!  Our second appetizer was Crab & Artichoke Dip with crostinis.  There was melted cheese on top and lumps of crab so they are not slighting you in the crab department!  Both of our appetizers were big and tasted great!    I would go back for the happy hour, it runs from 3 until 7 and 10 until close.  $5 appetizers  that is about half price to the normal.  $1 off signature beers.  There is actually quite a few more specials for happy hour but those were the only one I paid attention to!"}
{"text":"I brought some clients in on Presidents day and it wasn't busy due to the holiday. Our waitress helped us immediately with ordering our drinks.  My order the Ahi salad - The tuna was blackened and seared rare over fancy greens and a balsamic vinaigrette and Cajun remoulade. Very good flavor and the Ahi was really tender and full seared perfectly.  Productive client meeting - my half a million dollar project will start next month!"}
{"text":"Our server did a great job.  Bobby was on point, didn't hover, but watched out for us and his other 6 or 7 tables.  He seemed to be the only one serving in the dining room.  He was constantly busy, but made us feel like we were his only table.  Great job Bobby!  The food was on point, great burgers and fries.  Nice quick meal."}
{"text":"Came to this place after an Arizona Cardinals game.  It was walking distance from the stadium and from the hotel we were staying at which was nice.  Went around 9pm which was happy hour.  Their menu for happy hour was extensive both in the amounts of alcoholic drinks and food items.  Our group ordered several cocktails and several of the food items.  Specifically I ordered the mango and pineapple Margarita which was very refreshing.  Sweet without being overly sweet with a (very) nice amount of tequila in it.  The second drink I ordered was the strawberry soda but they didn't have the strawberry rum......  so then I went with the cucumber and lime Margarita which was good but not as good as the pineapple Margarita.   Food wise we had the blue crab and artichoke dip which was just insanely out of this world.  The ratio of blue crab to dip was amazing, each scoop had at least multiple pieces of crab on it.  By far the best appetizer we tried there.  Also had 2 different types.of chicken wings, one was a Spicier blend then the other but was mediocre.  Their egg rolls too were subpar.  The pizza was forgettable.  The fried calamari I'd go back for.  Atmosphere was nice.  Definitely it felt fresh and full of energy.  Servers were attentive and conversational.  Would've given them 4 stars because you csnt run oit of crrtain ingredients for your cocktails and the appetizers were just so-so...but I left my phone there but they were observant and nice enough to hold on to it until I got back which was definitely going above and beyond what they needed to do.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! Both kiddos ordered off their kid menu . One was a cheeseburger and chips , the other was chicken strips and chips. Both priced at $4.99 drink not included (apparently kid cups aren't a thing either?) their meals seemed a bit on the small side but they ate everything and seemed to enjoy it.  My husband and I ordered the same thing. The grilled chicken breast sandwich. His came with fries and I tried the spatzel & mushrooms . The chicken sandwiches were out of this world amazing !! Perfectly grilled chicken, crispy bacon, fried onion, grilled bun. And the price is great at  $10.99 . The spatzel was ok- I wouldn't order it again, but we will definitely be returning to try new goodies. Also, keep an eye out for their happy hours . Sunday happy hour is all day long !"}
{"text":"Won't go back.....  PERIOD.  Sliders were dry and overcooked.  The experience ended with negative remarks from management."}
{"text":"Marzen BBQ chicken sandwich and beer are on point. You won't be disappointed. Garlic fries, do you need to say more."}
{"text":"Came here for valentines and surprisingly we were able to be seated without reservation. It did take some time but no biggie, me and my friend walked next door to window shop. After our buzzer buzzed we were seated in view of the kitchen. Service was ok, not very attentive but ok for a busy night. I enjoyed their beer as always as I've visited back home their Rockville, MD and McLean, VA locations. I ordered wings (cheat meal) with my beers and they were good. Nothing extraordinary about the visit but it's a chain and I left satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips but I got a plate of dry fish sticks.  I wish they would have added a disclaimer in the menu not to expect the usual golden cod fillet, but rather a dark red childish stick of fish when you order this entree.  Not good...not good.  Even though I got the old bait and switch, I do want to come back and try another entree.  The other 3 entrees my family ordered looked very good.  The amber style beer I had was good."}
{"text":"Pros: Clean. Consistent quality with other chain restaurants.  Cons: My friends and I came here on Wednesday night. I think we were dressed appropriately (especially since everyone else in the dining room was wearing casual clothes and shorts). However, the hostess refused to seat us in the dining room. Maybe because it was all Caucasian people in the dining room and we were a party of 2 Asian girls, 1 Caucasian girl, and 1 African American girl. The hostess attempted three times to get us to not eat in the dining room. After I refused, she grudgingly sat us near the other patrons. This set a very negative tone for the rest of our meal.  I had the root beer (bland), calamari (can't see why it gets such rave reviews), garlic fries, and lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Good selection of Gordon Biersch brews. Daily happy hour + reverse happy hour are worth taking advantage of as the drink specials are OK and the food specials are amazing.  Nice second-story location offers good views of Mill Ave. below, especially if you can nab a spot on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a year now.  It's always amaizing.  The service at the bar.  Always on point! Becky Bare makes the most amaizing margaritas! They're blue!  Foods always good. I get 1 of 3 things every time. The hot wings, the Flatbread Pizza, or the California burger,  I would recommend them all.  The management is beyond amaizing. Always making sure we get a \"MALL DISCOUNT\"  for working at the mall. Thanks for all the hard work guys and ladies!!"}
{"text":"Ok folks here is the straight scoop on this establishment.  It ROCKS! Jacylyn our server was awesome and recommended a great wine choice as well as entre advice. We were treated great and the atmosphere great. What more could you want. Great job!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with a business associate and ordered the Woodford Reserve Bourbon Grilled Chicken with Asparagas and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I  couldn't have asked for a better meal! The chicken was very tender and flavorful and the vegetables along with it were the perfect combination. I would highly recommend this meal selection to anyone!"}
{"text":"Beer specials are off the hook and tasty as heck. My Wife and I loved the bratwurst aslidder and steak street tacos were off the hook. Our sever was super fast and helpful. His name was Michael and he's great!"}
{"text":"Hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job. Maybe too many of them? The service was fast but I wouldn't say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- don't order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean."}
{"text":"My wife and I were seated for about 15 minutes before I went and asked where our server was and they said they'd go get him/her.  Another 10 minutes passed and I went again to ask where our server was. Eventually the manager came out to apologize and comped us a few appetizers.  It was a Saturday so I can understand being busy but knowledge and get a few drinks isn't something that should happen.    The food wasn't impressive, my grilled chicken pasta had zero flavor.  Some of the dishes my colleagues had were also very bland and dry.  I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to make an excuse to go to so far. The only thing that makes these beers better is that they are priced so well. Do yourself a favor, get a Jolly Good Brown, Crab Dip, & Gorgonzola ribeye. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I always forget about GB when we are in Boca but because the place next door didn't even have servers we left and came here. There was no one even there which was surprising because it was lunch time and it's fairly big place.   Anyways, our server came out to greet us right away. When you have a toddler you simply don't have the luxury of dining for a hour at a time. We quickly ordered and our food came out about 10-15 minutes later. I had the crab cake Benedict which was on their brunch menu. I liked that the crab was \"real\" crab and although it was a little on the salty side it was still pretty good. My husband ordered the CBLT. He said it was good and the lack of sandwich told me he did in fact enjoy it.   Overall, the service was great and the food was good. We would probably come back if we didn't forget about GB next time!"}
{"text":"Overall a pleasant dinner with my co-worker from work this past Monday.  Sat at the bar for immediate accommodation, found the service hit and miss, sometimes she was ready at the right time and in other cases you'd have to wait for a while with an empty drink (which any bartender would I'm sure rather have topped off for any willing patron).  An appetizer I ordered since I was famished also came so late it might as well have come with the meal itself, which defeated the purpose.    Amber lager tasted excellent, so I did quality assurance a couple times, for consistency's sake.  They were equal, so they get a pass.  Location is easily spotted and parking was more than plenty for when we visited.  Had a seafood pasta which on paper sounded busy, but worked well enough in reality.    Debating a 3 star vs. 4 star just because of the service, but the drinks were tasty and the food was fine, so I'll chalk it up to bad luck in this case and not the norm for the place.  Two things which have nothing to do with anything, but are memorable nonetheless.  The full size mirror in the men's room is mounted at an offset downward angle, which after you've had a couple beers messes with your balance.  Thanks for nothing.  Also, and this must just be Vegas, there was a cigarette vending machine just outside that restroom.  The last time I saw one of those in CA was over a decade ago.  Crazy."}
{"text":"I try to like Gordon Biersch, I really do, but every time I visit a location, I'm always a bit disappointed.  This time, we tried the Gilbert location and the outcome was no different.  I decided to try a burger this time and not just any burger...I decided to pay the extra money for a Kobe burger.  I ordered it medium but it was delivered somewhere between medium well and well. It was dry and not too flavorful.  I should've just went with the regular burger.  My daughter ordered a pizza and wasn't too impressed with that either.  Over the years, I've tried many items on the menu (see, I told you I've really tried to like it), but haven't had anything worth eating again.  My recommendation would be that if you're going to Gordon Biersch, sit in the bar and order a beer and maybe some garlic fries..."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Shrimp and Lobster tacos are the shiznit! try them, they are good. Their specialty beers are blah..."}
{"text":"Was there for a business lunch, so didn't get to order beer. But their food and prices ere okay, good sized portion. The taste was also good. Wouldn't say great though. The customer service though was great. Would go there again for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food and even better beer. I highly recommend this place. The menu is quite extensive, everything from burgers to seafood.  Ohhhh... Did I say the beer was quite good?? Yeah, I know I did!! I'm just reiterating the fact that the beer is really good. They make it onsite."}
{"text":"I've long held the view that Gordon Biersch is significantly underestimated as a player in the craft beer scene. They were one of the last bastions of Reinheitsgebot until recently. Alas, The market has spoken and you will now find various double IPAs and black IPAs and red IPAs... I can't lie-I was hugely disappointed the last time I went in because they did not have the Czech Pilsner on tap. That is one of the best beers going and it's criminal to not have it be a permanent part of the tap lineup. Regardless, their brewers know what they're doing and I would argue that anything they have on tap is a cut above. The food is a bit pricey but very good. Luckily, I go there for the beer and they've got a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Was starving when I got here after a 3 hour flight so of course I ordered more food than I could eat. Got the Tapas appetizer and California burger (plus two Malty beers). Service was great and quick. Food was good. Would come back."}
{"text":"Love the Czech pilsner.  Food is good some of the staff are great some are not.  Good crowd and great happy hour."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for several years and just ended up going there last night.  I was surprised to see how empty the place was, we passed many restaurants with lines out the door... Sunday night during spring training season is normally packed!    Waitress was nice but wasn't very attentive at all.  We barely saw her and she didn't check on us until I had to catch her attention... keep in mind it was totally dead inside.  Just didn't seem like she wanted to work.  Food was ehhh... wasn't bad by any means but didn't blow me away or even make me want to finish it.  Everything was mid temp, nothing was hot and fresh.  The cheese curds were $15 and they were bland... seriously nothing special.  Even the soda pop was low on flavor and tasted blah.    Last night was my one cheat meal for the week and it was a waste, I was totally bummed I wasted it for this place.  It seriously felt like no one gave a crap about working because the food wasn't memorable, the people weren't special and the whole atmosphere was just blah.    Really pricey for what we got.  Not worth it at all!!!"}
{"text":"Looks like  solid twos are the thing here.   Was seated quickly,  order taken quickly and  first round of drinks all appeared. Going quite well.  The garlic fries  came out shortly after and  that's when it started to go from  4 stars  downwards.    Cajun Pasta :  Nothing original or subtle,    I should known better.   Monotonous taste with all the right shapes present but it's a hit of their sauce and that's all you get for the rest of the meal.    NY Steak Sandwich  Massive,  but dry. The sauce was minimal and  the lack of drinks stopped Erin from getting through more than a third of it.  Also had those wonderful garlic fries but they either need to revisit the sauce  and  perhaps trim the gristle off  come to think of it this was a lame $14  sandwich.    Coffee :  Tepid,  like it's being heated by a lamp.  Only had to suffer two of these.   Service: Started out great but  the drinks stayed dry for most of the meal. This was not on game night, rush hour  so it looked like the usual mis match of staff to customers that seems to be Phoenix area speciality in casual dining.     Mediocre   to the point that I can't even  make fun of the place   it's just not worth it.  For non beer drinkers I can't see this being a place to seek out when  their close, but tastier analog that actually has hard cider, Yard House, is within a mile away."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. But the service was really slow, the resturant is not busy but it still took a long time to get seated and served. We waited 20 minutes for our dessert. We never got it and just canceled it ! Just glad to have left."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we visited on our Las Vegas trip, and it was nice to start off with some quality drinks before we started exploring.  We went last month, and my boyfriend is STILL raving about the Tapas with Flatbread.  The olive tapenade that came in this starter is something I am going to have to try and make myself because he won't stop talking about it.  For dinner, he had a Cesar Salad, and I had the Gorgonzola Pear salad.  He liked his salad, I didn't like mine.  Our service here was poor.  The waitress did not take our order for 30 minutes.  We eventually called another waitress over because we forgot what our waitress looked like and we had to ask who our waitress was.  It seemed like the people sitting behind us had excellent service, so it is a hit-or-miss experience. Cross your fingers and hope for a good server.  We will be back to the Gordon Biersch near us, anyways, because the appetizer and the drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants. But if I am going to go to meet some friends at a chain establishment, Gordon Biersch is the least egregious.   Pros: super clean, plenty of tv's to watch March Madness games, decent happy hour prices, convenient location for me. It also does not reek of smoke. I am not a native, so I still hate that I have to tolerate smokey bars after getting used to smoke-banned bars in other states. The bartenders were also very nice and efficient in their duties, even though it was a busy night.  Cons: the bar food was really disappointing. I ordered a crab artichoke dip and it just tasted like warm mayonnaise. It was very bland and needed some spice or tangy cheese and even the crab on top looked like it was sort of watery from a can. My friend ordered a charcuterie plate. The platter was appealing enough but the slice of brie was quite laughable with how small it was (about the size of 2 small butter pats). The bartender did say that it was a new menu item.   Overall, I would probably only come here again to just grab beer by itself."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but the service was terrible. I placed a to-go/delivery order as it was an option offered with the hotel I was staying at. Angelica answered the phone and as soon as I said I'd like it delivered her tone completely changed and was extremely unprofessional. It seemed that she was really bothered by my choice. Little did I know she would be the one to deliver my order. Her attitude was still very much there. Maybe she was just having a bad day? Either way, please leave it at the door when you arrive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while travelling on business.  I had the kobe burger and garlic fries.  My burger was cooked perfectly as I like it and it was juicy, fresh and tasty.  I am a huge fan of garlic and the fries were just heavenly!!!  Crispy fries tossed with garlic, parm cheese and parsley, ohhhhh YUM.....  I NEVER finish my fries, I finished these!!!  Our server was very pleasant and attentive.  The hostess was very pleasant also.  Service was quick. Definitely recommend this place if your in the area."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop fore and it's just been going downhill a bit more everytime. The staff is helpful but the food is \"meh\" at best. The steaks have been flavorless and ... well let's just say don't even think about ANY of the fish. Overcooked and overseasoned All in all I'd say SKIP IT"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with delicious food and a great staff. We hold The 101 Referral Network-Scottsdale monthly meeting at this restaurant where our 40+members enjoy great food and drinks! The management has been good to us since 2013."}
{"text":"Should have yelped this one first. Agree with the other 1-2 stars. Crap cheap food. Crap drinks. Overpriced."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for their late night happy hour, which I believe is 9-close. We were desperate looking for a good happier hour on a Saturday night, and this fit the bill perfectly!  The place was empty, but it had a great outdoor patio area (we went around 10) with some people in it. We decided to sit out there, and we ordered some drinks. The drinks were not the most discounted, being 1 dollar off per beer, and 2 dollar off glasses of wine. We also were thinking of ordering 3 of the food appetizer items at 5-7 bucks a pop...but then we saw this sampler on the menu for 11 dollars.  It had garlic fries, pulled pork sliders, and I think tex mex egg rolls. It was only 11 bucks, so we figured let's start with that! It came, and it was more than enough food for a good snack/dinner for two, and we were very happy when we were finished. It was all great quality, and we really liked it. The garlic fries were wonderful, but be warned, you will have garlic FIRE breath afterwards.  The server guy was pretty good, and overall we really enjoyed it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant and bar!!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Upscale patrons and delicious beer!  Great feel for your upscale neighborhood Brewery.  I highly recommend  P.S. They just upgraded their menu and it's fabulous"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service and beers are good. Anything I have ever ordered has been very good. It's a chain, but a much better choice than Red Robin or Applebees. Great place to go with family and kids."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner because of of the best servers in a long time, \"Jenna\".  She was a real delight and understood all the vegetarian options and careful to respect my request for that. It's always a pleasure to see someone who loves their job and understands impeccable service. This girl deserves a raise! The food was awesome as well"}
{"text":"Kendal was a great bartender! Friendly, catering, charming. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the prices are great for happy hour. I ordered the hottest wings on the menu. They weren't hot enough and Kendal was sweet enough to bring a special sauce on the side to make the wings perfect. I also got the sauce on my white shirt and she immediately got me soda water to get it right out. Thanks for the special touches. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I give it 2.5 stars, but yelp is rounding me up. WEAK  beer selection (both BJs and Yard House are infinitely better) and mediocre food (again, BJs and Yard House are better)."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Asian chicken Bites with a side of asparagus, and my husband got the Cajun Pasta. Both of us ate every bite! Service was great too! The only thing I didn't like was that it's very loud.  Regardless, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love going here for their warm bread pudding, it is great! Sign up for their email specials too, they send some great coupons."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I've already tried all the others at Westgate and boy were we disappointed. I should have taken it as a sign that we got seated immediately on a Saturday night and there were plenty of empty tables. The service was slow, they offered to bring ranch dressing and never showed up. The portion sizes are tiny and over-priced. One fish taco for $5 was smaller than I've seen at any other place. The grass fed beef sliders were $14 bucks and the size of silver dollars or maybe even smaller.  Bottom line: we won't be back. There are too many other places to eat that are way better! This was the worst pick of our weekend hands down."}
{"text":"Sat in the TV room.. pick the dining room for more comfort.  Ordered the sampler.. Czech Pilsner my fav.. not the best bewery in town. Our waitress, (Lauren) knew the beer, was very attentive. and personable. The food is mediocre..pricey bar food.  The Kobe burger was nothing special and the garlic fries soggy, the potato chip appetizer was cold and weird, cold chips w/some green onions, and hard chips of dark baccon sprinkled about...w/a side of blue cheese crumbles?? to do what with?? and more bacon, and something that was supposed to be Ranch."}
{"text":"BIERLY EDIBLE  Here's the sad part of this review: I use to love this restaurant brand. I ate at my first one during Spring Training in AZ near the ASU campus. It was a tradition for us all to go there yearly for dinner & drinks and we always had a great time. Then on flights through SFO I would go and grab some of their famous garlic fries. I'm sure my airplane travel neighbors loved that as was we flew to China. Recently we had a team dinner here at the Vegas location and it was anything but good.   I am not sure what has happen but the food is just terrible. I know they brew the beer fresh but why can't the food be fresh too. I'm not sure how this place is going to survive because there is just too much good food out there to be wasted on this stuff.   We ordered a ton of apps and they were worse then warmed up Costco samples. The sad part is that we were paying for these & Costco samples are free. If I was the chef that designed this menu, then I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I even worked on it. The visit here left enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I may never ever visit another one of these chains again.   For my entree I ordered the tuna blue and it was the weirdest piece of tuna I've ever had. The colors were not vibrant at all. It was probably the saddest piece fish I've ever eaten. My friend & fellow Yelper kept saying, \"Your fish doesn't look right!\" I used his famous line on him saying, \"Never order fish in a desert!\" It was the only way I could admit to my ordering mistake. I was just trying to be healthy. Guess what comes with my fish as a side?  Garlic Fries! Because noting says raw fish side more then garlic fries. Not!!! The kitchen couldn't even get them right. There was not a single chunk of garlic on my whole dish of fries. In the past this dish would be so garlicky that you couldn't talk to people for days. Not anymore. They were basically French fries missing any of its past glory. How can a restaurant go backwards on one of their signature dishes? It just doesn't make sense. All I know is that this place doesn't care about its food anymore. The temperature of the food was not hot which meant my dish was sitting while the other 12 dishes in my group were being made. It's not cool to send back a dish when you are trying to eat as a team.   My buddy Tony M got the beef medallions and he really didn't care for it. Another co-worker across from us cut up her swordfish and didn't even eat it. She said it was really dry. It's sad to have a group meal where the food is pretty much tasteless and inedible. I really wish we would have gone to another place.   The only app that was halfway good was the Southwest egg roll but honestly anything deep fried is really good. Except for the deep fried crab balls which were really crabby. I don't like eating crab which tastes like the sea. These things were really fishy. In fact, if I threw it into the ocean I am sure a fish would throw it back at me. The fried calamari was also not really good either. There was nothing fresh about it. The rings were really thin and it was more batter then actual fish inside.   Service was good. Our waitress did a nice job of serving us except she forgot to bring our chicken wings. I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure if we charged for them too. Hopefully another table enjoyed a couple of baskets of wings. I felt bad for one of the guys in our group. He didn't get his food until 10 minutes after we got ours. Which means the chef didn't make it or the waitress forgot to order it.    If you come here then just stick to the bier. It is the only thing that is made in house. The food is an afterthought and the chefs don't really care. Food needs to be made with love and passion but that is not going to happen here. Stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and attentive.  Jambalaya was way too salty. The andouille sausage could have been sliced hot dog (please leave the skin on and blacken a bit in a pan! Don't boil it!) Very mediocre. Wish they had added some kind of cool Cajun peppers like Arbol, ancho, anaheim, guajillo, anything!   In conclusion don't order the jambalaya. Bf's burger was really, really good, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Ask for Kryshel. Nice person with great service and smile. Good beers on tap"}
{"text":"Once again, Brittany from last year was the one who told us not to miss Terrific Tuesdays at GB, so there we went!  We have become big fans of this day!  We have never been to the one in Atlanta on a Tuesday, although we have frequented it often, but always on the weekend, so I guess that's why we happened on this last year, thanks to Brittany.  But unfortunately, she is out of the serving business and has moved back to Georgia.  Alec was our server this time and we were seated immediately and he was very pleasant and took great care of us all night.  Since my usual sampler is not under the $2.50 21 oz. brews banner, I forewent that and went for one of my favorites, their delicious Hefe.  My wife got the special Sommerbrau.  Again we had skipped lunch, so we ordered starters each:  my wife went for the fried artichoke hearts, and I went for the 1/2 wedge salad with bacon and bleu cheese crumbles and dressing.  She then had the chopped salad with ranch for her entree, and I chose the three baby brats starter for my entree!  We were so full we couldn't even order a second beer.  We love this place and it is always delicious and reasonably priced with great quality for the money.  We finally joined the Passport Rewards program before leaving!  Can't wait for next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner, but the manager was a complete asshole! I broke my kneecap about a month ago and this was my first time out. I'm still in a leg brace. I had just gotten settled in a booth with my leg elevated. I forgot that my cane was sitting just beside the booth, and the manager came by, picked it up, and berated us for leaving it sitting next to the booth!  He said someone could have tripped and fallen and broken their leg. Ummmm, hello!? You're in the service industry. Couldn't you have politely just said, do you mind if I move this out of the way? Or if you had given us one minute, it would have been moved. After he walked away, the entire table commented on what a jerk he had been. His tone was offensive. I gave the waitress a BIG tip for having to deal with him as a boss!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a disaster! We arrived after the Monday Night Football game, so we assumed the wait and service would be suspect, but this place made a joke of our already-low expectations.   The host told us the wait would likely be 20-30 minutes, unless we wanted first-come seating in the bar. Nothing was open in the bar at the time, so we figured the wait would be reasonable. We put our name in and took a seat in the waiting area.  During our wait, we watched various people come up to the host from the bar area saying they hadn't had anyone wait on them. One waitress came up a few moments later huffing and snatched two menus to take to the one couple's table.  One guy walked by us on his way out and said they sat him and he sat there for 30 minutes and never even saw a waiter or even got a glass of water. His words? \"The service here is HORRIBLE.\"  At that point, we had already waited for 20 minutes, and with no improvement on our status, combined  with those customer warnings, we decided to just order food to-go. We placed an order with the host and he ran off to put it in.   We had hoped that would work out. Well, 30 more minutes goes by...nothing. We ask the host how long the wait would be for our takeout order and he said \"probably another 30 minutes...\" For salads? Wow. We left.  The overall rating for this place should've been warning enough, but as one of the places open later on a Monday, it seemed a fair risk for some post-game food. Apparently this location has no idea how to run or staff a restaurant for such a busy area. By far, the worst experience I've ever had...and we didn't even get a chance to taste the typically-average fare GB is known for. It's a shame we can't get a refund for that wasted hour of our lives."}
{"text":"I had lunch and found everything very average other than the prices. I had the Fish and Chips which was good except I was expecting French fries (chips) but instead I was served cold potato chips. I'll be back for a beer and happy hour but I don't see me coming back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at GB always amazing.  Great service and top notch craft beers.  Their IPAs and my favorite Hefeweizen are always on point.  Highly recommend this place for Happy Hour: 4-6:30 pm weekdays; and ALL DAY on Saturday!  Who can beat that?"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix, AZ, upon getting seated, server, Lindsay, was impeccable with her service. The Pan Fried Citrus Chicken was great, cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was relaxed with a calm and relaxed ambiance. The price was great during happy hour, although, the service and food was so great, I would happily pay full price. I plan on coming back again. Thank you Lindsay!"}
{"text":"Ok, so on Gabe's recommendation, I tried the Blackened Ahi Tacos today... they were freakin awesome! The ahi was seared perfectly and they come in a hard shell WRAPPED in a soft shell to keep all that good stuff in!!   My coworkers and I come here alot for lunch and after work drinking sessions... the bartenders know us well and take very good care of us... even when we get a bit rowdy!   For a chain restaurant Gordon Biersch knows how to bang out some damn good food! Word to the wise: Stay away from the garlic fries if you're only half way through your work day... they are POTENT!"}
{"text":"Located in the Hughes Center. Gordon Biersch has one of the best loyalty programs around. I get weekly offers. The brewery offers free tours. They have events almost every week, some supporting local charities. They held a blood drive. These are good community minded folks! Oh and the food, beer are tremendous, and the service is superb! So join their loyalty program, get the offers and come on in! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few weeks ago with some girlfriends and had the shrimp and mango salsa tacos.  OMG there were delish.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Good beer & food but servers were in the weeds. They were busy so I understood."}
{"text":"I really loved the food and Mark our waiter was super nice. and the atmosphere was great sitting on the balcony 2nd floor.  Nice"}
{"text":"I have regularly frequented Gordon Biersch for the past 17 years, both the Paradise main location, and the Bocca Park's while it was still open. I have seen the menu change throughout the years, but the food remained great through it all. I went back yesterday after a long absence, their blue cheese burger was no longer in the menu, but our server kindly checked with the kitchen and said they could make it. The burger was great as always, but I was somewhat disappointed by the garlic fries, served lukewarm, and the chicken wings had a different, less appealing seasoning. These are two of their signature dishes they shouldn't mess with. The beer was great as always, and the dessert -chocolate budino cake- decent. Our server was nice, but too busy with a larger group, so our service was delayed. I love this place and wish I could rate it a 5, but as it stands it's a 3 now."}
{"text":"Coming from the Aloha Fest, we didn't want to stand in line for food so we walked down Mill and chose this restaurant.  We ate outside, our server was here and there. My better half had the Lobster Shrimp Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips. My  wife loved her three tacos. Has to be one of the best seafood tacos that she has ordered. My fish and chips were cooked perfectly, with a light batter with some crunch to it and the cole slaw was okay. Unfortunately, we didn't have any of their brews, but maybe the next time we come back."}
{"text":"I can't remember a trip to Vegas when we haven't gone here.  The food is always good. This time I had the Cajun fish tacos, she had a chicken and shrimp platter with rice. She said hers was really good, tacos could have used a little more Cajun spice but they were still good. Slaw on the tacos was perfect. For beers, we had a Marzen and a Hefe. They were both 4 out of 5. Service was efficient and friendly. I had asked to make my beer and she must not have heard me but otherwise, no complaints. We went on a Thurs night and it was busy but there wasn't a wait for a table inside, the patio was really hoppin' though. This is always our 'go-to' if we can't decide on anything because they never disappoint."}
{"text":"came in a few times looking for our favorite server shana.  what happened to her??"}
{"text":"One star. A large group of us called ahead and the restaurant was very empty and they still took forever to accommodate everyone. Food was mediocre, skimped on the nachos and my friend sent his burger back twice because they didn't know how to cook it. AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Great location, upstairs on Mill Ave. & 5th Street. Head there for good microbrew selections (check for their seasonal brews), great food, and a good lively atmosphere. The place is split between bar and restaurant- all the TV's are on the bar side FYI.  Staff is friendly; our server was awesome keeping the drinks refilled and food was delivered nice and hot. Most of the table got a sandwich of some sort- the kobe burger looked really good and the BBQ bacon burger is excellent. Their garlic fries are loaded with fresh garlic and parsley- make sure to have a breath mint or gum handy after digesting those (they are really good dipped in Ranch).  The place is a little pricey- a burger and 2 beers with tip is easily approaching $25-$30 range so be prepared."}
{"text":"This was an ok restaurant with good food and some really good micro brew beers.  Short walk to jobing.com arena makes it a good meeting place pre-game."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here after shopping. I had a liter of their lightest pilsner along with artichoke dip and seated tuna we both shared. DELICIOUS!! She continued on with the 12 ounce steak which was a perfect medium rare. She nearly swooned at how melt in her mouth tasty it was. I ordered the Lamb Lollipop plate.  FANTASTIC.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"So what happened to this place! The menu was so dang dirty I didn't want to touch it! When I mentioned it the comment was \"yap we been busy\"  The carpet is like an oil slick! Three girls at front desk one eating from a coffee cup. $13 bucks for a okay salad with a bit of chicken. At least you can get a good beer here, you'll need your beer goggles to not notice the grim."}
{"text":"Other than their appetizers, beers and garlic fries, the food here is nothing special. Great for group gatherings and hanging out. It's a decent alternative during times (like CES) when it's nearly impossible to get a dinner reservation at a reasonable time at at a nicer restaurant. Very high energy, cool decor and  incredibly spacious."}
{"text":"The food is always okay, the service ok, and the the drinks okay.  It is close to my work and the spot we head to after outfitting the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts."}
{"text":"summerbrau is light, lots of citrus, low alcohol% and 40%-off menu specials before 4pm  --hummus and goat cheese salad with chicken; it's worth the trip. --wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon is my comfort food. --MEAN garlic fries; use caution. --gorgonzola potato wedges, $1 extra, but SO good. --rib-eye, though most expensive on the menu, is awesome, and it's with a pile of mashed potatoes and veggies. --specials may have expired by the time you read this, but rigatoni, corned-beef reuben are my favorites from the 40%-off menu. --check the burger specials, (though if you're a purist, the beef patties arrive frozen) --veggie or pepperoni pizza, but order it extra crispy --staff is always extremely friendly, helpful, will fix ANYthing without question, so don't be afraid to ask if you have a request --cool shot-glass desserts, if that's your thing.  If only they'd have freedom to use fresh ingredients to create \"chef's specials\"; i'm sure they'd be great."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and I really like the vibe. I always sit at the bar and they bartenders are quick and give great service. Everyone loves the Marzen, it is a perfect beer. I am not a beer fan, but this is the reason why I return to this place. It's August, and they have a tasty Seasonal beer that was perfect.   The Garlic fries here are popular. I arrived at happy hour and tried the potato chip nachos. I don't think nachos should go on anything other than tortilla chips now because of this experience. It was not bad, but I would have been happier if it were regular nachos. They were generous with the sour cream, but skimpy on cheese, pico de gallo, and it didn't have black olives or jalepenos. I understand every place has their way of presenting a food, but I didn't enjoy this particular dish. Anyway, it was only $5.   The pizza was Ok too, a personal pan pizza for $5 is a great deal, especially at a place that has nice ambiance.   I think they are known for their burgers. If I were prepared to have a real meal I would have chosen the sliders, which are pretty tasty. I have had those before.   My suggestion is to come during happy hour, to get the dollar off beers and $5 appetizers. Their regular menu prices are a little pricey, and if you are not a total fan already or just looking for a decent place to have beer, it can seem a little over priced.  I will definitely return to this place, it beats the Madisons up the street!"}
{"text":"Love the location really nice people but every time it feels like a sodium over dose an indigestion. I think they need to get back to basic simple and fresh."}
{"text":"Decided on this restaurant after 10pm on Saturday. Cool crowd,  seemed to be a bunch of semi - regulars. Would've given them a 5 star review but the soup of the day (chicken noodle) that I ordered as a starter was cold. Not freezing,  but not hot. Settled on the Cajun pasta and it was solid. Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"Second time at Gordan Biersch, first at this location.  I like this place.  The food and value is good for what you get.  My favorite menu items are the small plates.  I'll get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry I am.  Last night I enjoyed the Gorgonzola Prosciutto Chips which were very tasty, even if I am 99% sure it was just ham and not prosciutto (lol).  The Gorgonzola sauce is the bomb.  I seriously wanted to lick my plate. Their beers are good and I am not a beer drinker at all.  My husband ordered their new pumpkin spice brew and I kept stealing sips, it was so delicious! This location has fantastic atmosphere, being in the middle of the hopping section of Mill Ave.  That being said, parking is horrific on a Friday night.  Our service was really fantastic.  All in all, a great place and we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. The beer was good. My date and I split the gigondor plate of appetizers and it was really good. I doubt the sliders are kobe, however, I dont know if I cared. (When I think of sliders, I think of White Castle... if you want them to be \"sliders\", make them with cheap beef, not Kobe, or call them mini burgers). Anywhoop... we sat at the bar. The bartender was nice & was attentive enough without being annoying. Overall, I enjoyed myself there. I think I might go there more often and try out more of the menu. This location is WAY better than the location on Mill, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Upon entering the bar level (up the interior stairs), and seating myself at the bar, the lone bartender but pleasant Mariah was a bit over taxed with many patrons (more typical these days in American service). I wondered when the dirty salad plate dishes would be removed in front of me, and the bar counters wiped down? It had taken awhile. Anyway, once done she was more accommodating, friendlier also with another colleague accompanying me. The Biersch beer selections always good and cold (16 or 21 ozs. The food's normally good quality and plenty of variety selections at moderate pricing. In a nutshell, I've always liked Gordon Biersch's. A little slow starting tonight but improved as the night wore on. This was a good thing!! Really 3 1/2 stars. 4 if the staff would have been more attentive!"}
{"text":"Call ahead for reservations!  We made last minute reservations (it was a Saturday night I think) just in case.  The hostess was so nice on the phone and expecting us when we got there.    The service was good considering they were a little busy (not swamped, but there were several large parties that night).    The food was really good and they have a kids' menu so even our little picky eater was able to find something suitable.    Great place if you need a chill/casual date night."}
{"text":"One star for customer service, but -4 stars for poor food quality: do not order the \"Kobe sliders.\" They are (or at least appear to be) pre-frozen, pre-cooked, brown hockey pucks of tough flavorless cheap meat. The mini-buns are worthless, as well. I think someone from Gordon Biersch needs to pay a visit to the slidinthru slider truck to get a hint on how sliders should be. And when you add \"Kobe\" to the title, even higher expectations are fostered. For $11? Seriously you guys. Get a clue. To the public - avoid these, and just stick with GB's normal steak burgers. They are good.   GB Gen'l Mgmnt - take the sliders off the menu or do them right."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night, seemed like much faster seating than nearby Cheesecake Factory.  Had the ny strip and grilled shrimp ($22) with the crab and artichoke dip app. ($9)  The app came promptly with crustini bread.  It had chunks of blue crab on the top and a cream cheese base.  We ended up boxing most of it due to our entrees arriving so fast.  The steak was thin and juicy.  Mashed potatoes as a bed can never be bad.  Green beans were also flavorful, A1 added to make everything go down easy.  Grilled shrimp were a bit plain, I believe there were 5 of them on a double skewer.  Our server was very attentive and the all important iced tea remained mostly full."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for happy hour. Enjoyed the beer especially the Maarzen but agree with another poster that they don't provide a full pint. We also had a couple of appetizers that were great. Recommend the flat bread and the clams. Waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat outside with multiple  misters going and had German Bier, Golden Export/Kolsch and had Bratwurst Sliders,  Apple Cider Kolh Slaw, Marzen BBQ Burger with Garlic Fries! It was Wunderbar! We finished the meal with Apple Crostini with Ice Cream!  HAPPY Hour is Great to sample both German Biers and Cocktails!"}
{"text":"Cool place! My cousin got us about 70% off of our bill!  Dishes that were ordered to share: the garlic and sweet potato fries, which GB is known for.  I started off with a salad. It had bacon and cheese. Hooray obesity  I got the kobe burger that I wanted medium but it was medium well which made me sad. and asparagus and mushrooms.  I also got a Mojito. Cue the weird Mojito commerical guy!  This was cool because we had our own little room and since my cousin works for Rock Bottom it was only about 20/per person! I wish the food was better!!!!! AHHH! Pretty good for dinner in Sin City!  Our server was FANTASTIC, but that doesn't make up for the fact I had a hockey puck instead of a mooing burger!"}
{"text":"3 of us had a deliscious meal. The steaks are great and the garlic fries......lets just say no vampire near us tonight, lol yummy. Both the men had beer which was realy good, however we did send one back as it was a short poor with well over an inch of head which was disapointing. The beer should reach the measure mark on the glass not be all froth.  Overall good beer and food. Service not the quickest but we had plenty of time anyway. Will return."}
{"text":"I really like the location and the layout of the restaurant/bar.  Great place to watch some sports and have a beer.  However, for a vegetarian who likes IPA's this isn't the place to go.  Pizza or salad are your only real choices.  From a beer standpoint, I just don't like German beers, so thats my fault not theirs.  Their Hefeweizen is actually pretty good, but I really don't go beyond that.  I don't like the Pilsners, Lagers or Kolsches.  I wish they'd go outside the box and do some more styles of brewing and add some vegetarian things to the menu.  As it is, we really only go about 2x a year due to the limited options.  Not saying it's a bad place, unless you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because it really is A-OK. Food was good but place was a bit loud.  I had the Steak Frites and it was cooked exactly as I asked - Med Rare."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends. Nice place, nice atmosphere, okay service, GOOD beer, blah food! I had a Medium rare, Bacon Cheeseburger w/cheddar cheese and jalapenos on the side w/Garlic fries. My wife had the Fish Tacos.   When my cheeseburger came, I noticed immediately the jalapenos were already ON the cheeseburger, instead of on the side. I bit into the thing and it was VERY well done, instead of Medium Rare. Honestly the thing didn't really have a whole lot of taste to it. It was VERY bland! Simple seasoning could FIX that. The Garlic Fries weren't bad at all, but I would probably get regular Fries next time.  My wife said the Fish Tacos were more like a Fish Stick shoved inside a flour street taco tortilla. She said they had ZERO flavor to them. However, the Beer was GOOD! I doubt I'll come back, especially just for their beer! There's too much good beer out there too.  My recommendation is if you just wanna drink beer? This's a good place to go. If you're hungry and really wanna eat? There's DEFINITELY better places to eat within walking distance from there."}
{"text":"There was a festival on Mill Ave on this particular weekend and the street was taken by tents for miles.  There were plenty of bars/restaurants closed.  So I visited Gordon B. as the savior for the night or so I thought.    We were sat on a table that had a broken leaf, it was hanging and bothersome.  It was not busy and our waitress took wayyyy too long to greet us.  After she finally came over, she asked if we wanted drinks and straight up just walked away, didn't even have a chance to order an app.  She probably had more tables then she could handle,. The clam cheese crostini  was rich in flavor filled with chunks of clam.  The Moroccan chicken was bland with dry jasmine rice.  The only reason this place gets 3 stars is for the beer tasting sampler."}
{"text":"First time guests, and have been ignored for. Good 15 minutes while another two other people were immediately attended after I say down. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"Good place with a wide selection of microbrew beers available, OK food and service next to the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We were trying to go to another restaurant for my birthday only to find  that it was closed for lunch on Sundays.  So we stumbled across Gordon Biersch on a Sunday afternoon needing something to eat and a little football would not hurt either.  We got there in time for their happy hour that starts at three.  It consisted of discounted drinks and a special happy hour menu.  We ordered a salad and fish and chips.  They would not give us potato chips in exchange for fries so we also ordered potato chips topped with chunks of bleu cheese.  Everything was good including the beer of course.  My girl friend really liked the fried fish.  Had a great time eating drinking and watching football.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I met Ken at Gordon Biersch for an evening meeting and to catch up. The food was very good with very generous portions. It was late on Tuesday evening March 25th so there was seating available with televisions surrounding us to keep up with the latest scores. Our server was Rachel and she is five stars all the way. Took our orders right away and very attentive. She invited us back on Thursday night because she works behind the bar. A very good spot with friends for almost any occasion."}
{"text":"I was at this location Sunday May 4, 2014 a little before noon for a private program. I was told we would have light appetizers but would be able to order something later if we decided to stay for the Sunday Brunch. There was no ordering later as there were Kobe sliders, egg rolls, hummus, chicken wings and garlic fries a plenty. Everything was quite good and everyone was required to take something home by our host. Very nice private room. They have live music on Sundays. It's an older crowd but the entertainment is outstanding with old school and classic R&B being performed. Get there before noon if you want a seat."}
{"text":"Hell no! My first warning should have been only one other table occupied by a table of 4 that was quite vocal about the place.  They quickly left. The 2nd warning shot should have been waiting 15 minutes for our menu, another 20 minutes for our appetizer and then 30 minutes for our overcooked totally bland food that was barely luke warm. They beat all the flavor out of the Kobe beef sliders to the consistency of shoe leather.  And then the food finally shows up, definitely not even warm. My son's 1/2 pound burger was supposed to be medium...nope.  My gorgonzola rib eye was supposed to be medium rare...again, nope.  Obviously the kitchen can only cook everything well done & suck all the flavor out.  My daughter's salad was completely forgettable.  The one saving point was the strawberry lemonade.  Probably bought somewhere else. Is it any wonder that 4 Peaks is ALWAYS full and this place was a ghost town?  Not to us. And then the final kick in the pants was the $85 tab for a meal that made was completely underwhelming.  Service was so-so. We went here because I got gift certificates for Father's Day and will never return."}
{"text":"It's been a over a decade since I've been to a Gordon Biersch restaurant / brewery. I remember GB as being one of the original regional micro-brewers in the United States.... you could say that GB started the trend towards micro-breweries.... and Garlic Fries.  I really don't remember anything about the Beer or the food at Gordon Biersch... except for the Garlic Fries, mainly because no other restaurant was serving Garlic Fries. The decor of the restaurant has not changed one iota. Restaurant tables and chairs stained in Euro medium-dark hues. Booths with back-to-back bench seating, with open sides. Hanging cylindrical-tube transluscent lamps that reminded me of Kona Grill lamps in color. Seems as if GB had not hired an Interior Decorator in a decade or so.  On the menu yesterday...  Weekly Burger Special (*** 1/2 $10.50) An item which changes weekly... This week's Burger was a half pound Burger inside a buttered Hamburger Bun with Peppercorn Cheese and an Aioli Mayo Spread. The Bun could have been a little stiffer, but the Beef Pattie was fried just right - Medium... you can't get it any rawer, something about local Health regulatioins. But, the Aioli was too liquidy. Came with a side of Garlic Fries (*** 1/2) ... you know you have to have some Garlic Fries when you dine at Gordon Biersch. Fries were slightly over-fried... but you definitely had Garlic and Parsley all over the Fries.  Sampler Beer Shots (*** $5.50) Six  3oz Shots of Gordon Biersch's \"Famous Handcrafted Beers!\"... lined up on a paper place mat... each shot glass is placed on it's proper circular trademark with a brief description of each Beer below that for your reading pleasure. Just a li'l teaser for your drinking pleasure. Consisted of the following yesterday...    Golden Export (** 1/2) A smooth, refreshing lager, lightly hopped with a        dry finish. The demand was so high when it was first brewed in the        1870s that it was \"exported\" to other regions in Germany. Not bad....        but light, kinda weak.    Hefeweizen (* 1/2) A German-style wheat beer that is crisp and        refreshing. This light and sparkling Beer is known for it's signature        aroma that suggests Cloves and Bananas. Suggests! The Beer        shouts to the High Heavens of Cloves! Not my favorite... by a long        shot.    Czech Pilsner (****) A Bohemian-style Pilsner, golden hued, medium        bodied, accented with the spicy hop character of the signature Saaz        hops, imported from the Czech Republic.    Marzen (*** 1/2) A smooth, medium-bodied, auburn lager. Märzen        means \"March\" in German; it was named from the Bavarian tradition        that it is brewed during the month of March and stored in caves to be        consumed in warmer weather. It is a medium-hopped lager with a        mildly sweet nish.    Schwarzbier (*) This lager's name literally means \"black beer\" in        German and although the color may traditionally suggest a heavier        body, ours boasts a light body with a chocolate nish. The Schwarzbier        has won a gold medal at the 2006 World Beer Cup and a gold medal        at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival. A wanna-be Guiness that        does not succeed.    Seasonal Beer Selection (*** 1/2) Dunkelweizen is a seasonal beer,        brewed from March to June. \"It's all about the malted wheat and yeast        in this beer,\" Gordon says. The roasted malt offsets some of the        banana, citrus and clove flavors, producing a sweet, rich and slightly        spicy brew that is both refreshing and nuanced. Before bottling,        Gordon Biersch's Weizens undergo five to six weeks of aging, which        intensifies the flavor and enhances the beers' unsurpassed        smoothness. Most other breweries do not exhibit such patience        when brewing wheat beers.  Not as dark as the Schwarzbier... one        drink and you're Sold.  As you see... a mixed bagof ratings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently went here for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. I had the dragonfly mojito and it was super yummy and such a girly drink, only $5 on happy hour! We ordered the egg rolls, crab dip and slider combo. All the food was completely delicious and hot. Our waitress, Erica V, was very sweet and attentive (wish there were more like her). The only thing was the total bill was pricey because we overindulged in all the yummy appetizers and drinks. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, I ordered a Marzen BBQ Burger and Garlic Fries, It was yummy food!  We had a great waitress and the food was made right and got it pretty fast"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Our friends who were getting married, took us all (the bridal party) here for dinner thinking it would be a great fun place. Not.  Service was slow. So slow. The food was actually something to write home about. \"Hey Mom, I found a big knotted gnarly hair in my salad, that was offered to me because everyone at the table got their meal 30 minutes before mine came out\" haha and then the waitress says, oh we'll take that salad off your bill. Um excuse me, you offered it to me while I waited 30 minutes because I had no food and you were actually going to charge me? What! - Weird. This was the Bride to be's meal and salad and the one paying for our huge bill. Huge bummer, will never go there again, ever. Bland food and bland service."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their burgers.  Anyone who toasts their buns is alright by me.  However today my burger was more like a slider. We decided to come here after work to kill some time because we didn't want to drive in the monsoon.  Our waitress was less than enthused to wait on us.  She spent quite a bit of time talking to the table next to us.  It appeared that the one young lady worked there and maybe it was her day off because I saw a cook also come out and chit chat with her.   Anyways....I asked for water when she had a moment.  That moment was 10 minutes later.  She only had 3 tables so not quite sure why that took so long.  Our food arrives and I promise you it was so much bun and a lil baby patty (I never remember to take a picture until half way thru or at the end after I'm done).  I've never had a burger that small at GB.  I was very disappointed and was even more disappointed with our waitress who came by to see if our food was ok but didn't really give us a chance to comment because it was a drive-by how's everything, meaning she said it as she kept walking.  But then a cutie comes in and sat behind us and she was so chipper and happy go lucky.  I interrupted to ask for another coke because there was enough garlic on my fries to put on 4 other dishes.  12 minutes later I got my coke.  I watched her go in the back, talk to the  someone and talk and talk and then I saw my coke in hand but then she began talking to 2 other employees right in front of the bar.  I was very close to going to take it out of her hands myself because I was so thirsty from all the garlic.   My friend ordered the cod fish and chips I believe.  She said it was ok.  Not good, not bad. Got the bill and after 11 minutes of waiting for my friends change, we were finally able to leave.  Ive been to this location many times as I work down the street on Howard Hughes and I've never had service this poor."}
{"text":"Service was great, food not so great.  I had classic chopped salad.  The lettuce was bitter, the artichoke hearts were woody, and the ranch dressing was bland.  I ask, how can you mess up a salad?  Easily here.  Finally, I just gave up and sent the salad back.  Of course, I was asked if I wanted anything else so I chose a cup of their soup, beer cheese soup.  Blech.  Note to self, don't come here again."}
{"text":"After getting horrible service at firefly's bar over and over again, we decided to head over here and what great service! The bartender, a tall guy with a shaved head (i want to say jason? But don't quote me on that) was awesome. It is unbelievably hard to find good bar service in this town and he was such a breath of fresh air. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our server was good....she was attentive and food arrived the normal amount of time.    I have to say that I was disappointed with the Garlic Fries.  We're from the Bay Area and was happy to go to Gordon Biersch especially for their Garlic Fries....that's why we stopped here.  The fries would've have been good if they really smothered the fries with lots of garlic and seasoning.  It was like eating it without the after taste of the garlic and seasoning.  I've had better garlic fries from Gordon Biersch.    If you really want good garlic fries from Gordon Biersch.....go to AT&T Park Gordon Biersch to watch the SF Giants game....they really smother those fries with garlic and herbs.  I am never disappointed with AT&T Park's Gordon Biersch garlic fries."}
{"text":"Right when we walked in it captured us with ambiance and the smells coming from the kitchen were bomb!! I \"eyeballed\" a few platters while walking to my table and was very impressed!! The menu captivates you and makes it hard to decide!! Almost returned the same day to try new things on the menu !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably about five times and each time is like being on a roller coaster.. up.. down.. up ... down.  So with Gordon Biersch, the food I get is good.. is bad.. is good.. is ba... you get it.  I was here with some friends for my buddies birthday last night, and while the food wasnt the best that night, service was awesome and we got to sit outside in the perfect weather.  Overall I do enjoy the majority of the food. Who cant get enough of those garlic fries?  Of course after dinner, be sure to grab a mint.  The place is split into two sides, dinning side and the bar side, which also has some dining areas.  It sits on the second floor right above some club and Starbucks.  Coffee and drinking.. oh what a combo.  I love the whole Mill Ave. vibe going and this is a perfect place for this restaurant.  Is it my favorite place to eat in the world? Not even close.. however I will gladly eat here anytime.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go out to dinner, and we'd been talking about heading over to Westgate.  We both were in a burger mood, so our decision was made for us.  We've both enjoyed the burgers here in the past, and I was jonesing for some garlic!! (As a side note, neither one of us are really drinkers, so we don't go for the beer.)  It's been a while since we've dined here, so we figured it was about time to go back.  Being a Monday night, it wasn't too crowded, mostly patrons in the bar area watching the basketball game.  The dining room was practically empty.  We were seated immediately, and given the menus to peruse.  It had been a while since we've dined here, and the menus had changed a bit.  Hubby went with the BBQ bacon cheeseburger and I decided on the Kobe cheeseburger.  We both wanted the garlic fries.  It took a little while for our burgers/fries, but it was worth the wait.  The burgers were cooked perfectly.  I'm not a person who likes a big fancy burger, with lots of things on it.  Just give me the bare minimum, with a bun that complements the burger, not overpowers it.  This was that kind of burger.  I added a little ketchup and mustard, then put a tomato slice on it...perfection!  Onto the garlic fries...they are so scrumptious!  The fries were crispy on the outside, yet fluffy on the inside.  The garlic was distributed all over them, not just thrown on top, so there was lots of it.    For dessert, we decided to share the apple bread pudding with ice cream and a whiskey sauce.  OMG!!  It is served warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top slowly melting.  We drizzled the sauce over the dessert and dug in.  Let's put it this way, there wasn't anything left on the plate when we were done.    The food was so good!!  My only \"slight\" complaint is that it's a bit dark in the restaurant.  The booth we were sitting in had no overhead lighting.  So, when I first opened the menu, I could barely read it.  My husband really had a problem, because there was a light behind him, so he had a shadow over his menu.  Obviously, we managed, but it would've been nice to have a little overhead lighting, so we didn't have to strain to read."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. No blond bock, OK, I can get over that.... But it got worse. Put in our daughter's food order first, along with some appetizers. Purposely, so it would come out FIRST. About 10 minutes later we put in an order for the sausage platter, assuming that would come out SECOND. After all, it had been 10+ minutes since out last order, right? No, the sausage platter came out IMMEDIATELY(lukewarm on top if that)! But where were the garlic fries, mussels, and kid's pizza? We were told the appetizer side of the kitchen is backed up.... What!?!! Does this place not have any control over their tickets? Or did the server forget to put the first order in? Eventually, the rest of our food comes out. Thankfully, my daughter enjoys the pizza. Unfortunately, the 7$ plate of their \"famous\" garlic fries, is a mere handful of frozen french fries with some garlic thrown in top. Mind you, I've ordered this appetizer before, the Regular Size as I did on this occasion, not the small size, and it was much larger than this(and tasted better). They did bring us more fries, but I don't know why the first plate they sent out even made it out of the kitchen.... It looked as though someone had been munching on it in the back before it came out, or they threw the scraps on to a plate and served it to us. Whether that was the case or not, presentation and plating matters! It avoids complaints, we eat with our eyes first, then or mouths. Mussels were OK(not great), but for 5$ I think those were adequately priced. What happened to this place? I used to enjoy coming here, I'm a fan of good beer, good food, and good service. All tonight's visit had was good beer, I could've gone to the store and picked myself up some and saved myself the frustration of a terrible dining experience. It's unfortunate that management never even bothered to come apologize for the issues that had occurred. They were aware, but no one came to the table to discuss the issues so they can hopefully be corrected in the future!"}
{"text":"one of my most favorite breweries in Vegas.^^  ----Time Spent prolly 30+ visits past 4yrs.  ----LAYOUT spacious open seating built out of an old fire station's hull and complete with garage doors left from the past.   there are godzilla size beer vats at the far side of the entrance...   while not a very original layout, i think you will found it charming nonetheless.^^  ----SERVICE attentive and friendly staff...   the food delivery at the bar seem faster then on the floor.  i LOVE the menu.   although not several pages deep, i've been surprised by everything i've tasted on the menu.^^   F*CK.... where do i start.?!  my mouth starts to water as i think about the selection... LMAO.!!  for those coming to Vegas and want that UNIQUE experience in food...  both the sampler platters (Chef's Sampler/Brewer's Feast) have flavorful surprises.   i do like the rest of the appetizer menu, but the sampler platters are really where you want to start.!  main platter wise...  i've had their salads, but recommend the variety of pizzas (Pepp & Sausage) or fish (Chilean Bass - NOT Lobster Mac & Cheese - meh).   what really stands above the rest is their New York Steak & Shrimp...  very juicy... omg - so juicy.... LOLz.  my only CON with the menu is the Bistro Steak Medallions.   it was the very first thing i had at Gordon Biersch and recalled the portions small and the taste to be forgettable.  *cry*  finally, what's a Brewery without it's beers right.?   Gordon Biersch's beers were MEH to me... LOLz.   however, i NEVER go there without having at least 2 orders of my favorite Marzen.   OMG - the MARZEN is sooo good.^^   that dark drink that leaves my mouth with a smooth somber after taste.  *dies*  ----PRICING i don't recall the menu breaking the bank.   probably slightly more expensive then a trip to Outback Steakhouse.   i tend to eat a lot, so my bill averages $50 vs the $30 that i would spend at Outback...  i dunno if that'll help u gauge.  ----CLOSING if not for my discovery of Hot n Juicy Crawfish or my MOST favorite Ichiza...   Gordon Biersch use to be my favorite regular spot to hit for a place to kickback and relax.   you NEED to really try their sampler plates and the NY Steak at least once during ur Vegas visit.^^ ..... OR DIE..   jk.^^"}
{"text":"The service was good and so was the beer. I had the Gorgonzola Ribeye and asked for it medium rare. It was leaned heavily toward the well done side, which is why I am just rating this at a 3. The fries and calamari on the other hand were delicious. Stephanie our server was also on top of things. Great job to her!"}
{"text":"Came to Gordon for some yummy pizza and beer. I enjoyed myself greatly. Our food and drinks came out quickly. My friend and I had a wonderful server who was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. She was helpful with assisting us with our beer choices. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Great bar and bartenders especially Amanda! Everyone is very nice and they are always moving and doing something,  be it taking care of a customer, helping with service bar or cleaning and getting things ready. The bartenders know how to manage their time and always greet you with a smile. My husband comes here a lot when he is in town for business and always appreciates Amanda's kindness and attention to details like just remembering what kind of beer he likes. The food is good and quick and the beers are brewed in house. There are many kinds to chose from and are always cold and never flat."}
{"text":"Went to watch a hockey game because our hotel did not have the game on and stumbled across this place. The bar had open seating and we had no trouble finding two seats at the bar. When we sat down it just so happened to be happy hour which is daily 3-6:30. Staff was friendly, bar food was bar food quality, and the beer was great."}
{"text":"I have to give five stars because there was absolutely nothing wrong the night we had dinner.  We were seated promptly on a Saturday night and we didn't know but it worked out good for us. (they have happy hour all day Saturday).  Great price on their happy hour specials the drinks were very flavorful and appealing to the eye.   The food was perfect we had a variety of fish street tacos , wings some housemaid chips with Gorgonzola cheese and lobster Mac.   And of course you cannot forget the beer the beer. was cold and flavorful it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Foods great and so's the \"craft\" beer ! Good service , shout out to Christy , and lots of TVs to watch everything that's on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer before watching a movie. Tried a pilsner and a hef. They were decent. The bartender was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab quick bite while waiting for my ring to get re-sized. They have a good selection of beer on tap. I ordered the Marzen which was a nice amber.  We sat by the bar and ordered food. The bartender was nice and the food came out pretty quickly.  We ordered pulled pork sliders which were okay and the Hawaiian pizza which wasn't all that great. Overall was okay to come by for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We go there for a few quick drinks and food before seeing a movie, right across the street."}
{"text":"Tonight I came with a group of people. One guy in the group did illegally sneak in a bottle of beer from another establishment in the San Tan Mall complex. He was quiet, but it was brought to the manager's attention. He came over and told the guy that he could not bring the drink in and needed to get rid of it. The guy said you mean drink it? The manager said you need to get rid of it, so they guy drinks it and hands the bottle over to the manager. No one else in the restaurant saw an issue, but the manager said he refused to service not only him but the entire party. Good for you - we went elsewhere.He could have told the guy not to drink the beer and taken the bottle, but the rest of the party wasn't doing anything out of line. The waitress was nice and it is unfortunate, but sometimes nice people suffer too. I did not bring a drink into the building but was refused service as well, so I have no interest in supporting your establishment any longer. Good luck surviving the recession."}
{"text":"Good stuff, a bit pricey though, 7 dollar pretzel with beer mustard, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Disaster of a dining experience. Poor service on a not so busy Friday night. There are workers standing around doing nothing. They ran out of a couple of the dishes, and we had to re-order multiple times. One of our friends had to have his burger made three times. The first time the burger patty was raw."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch, extremely slow service. One hour 30 minutes and still waiting on salads.  Beer was fast.  Finally, a manager saw the look on my face. Someone short-staffed a Saturday lunch shift.  Customers get to pay twice.  The food is normally good.  Can't wait to find out.  Still waiting.  They took away my wilted salad and brought out everyone's at the same time, followed moments later by our lunches.  Way too many dishes on one table that was avoidable if their timing was right.  We were so hungry, we put salads with entries and made room.  Then came Tim, a manager.  He realized the goofs and comped our ticket for six.  I will always give a place another chance when they admit their mistakes and move to correct them."}
{"text":"Average food at best.  I got the beer batter halibut.  $18.50. 4 one ounce pieces of fish, fries and seasonal fruit. The beer batter was not crispy. 3 of us had dinner, 2 adult beverages total. $75.00. My wife got the gorganzola sirloin which was tasty and well cooked. The wait staff and manager were very nice. Just not sure I will go back for dinner."}
{"text":"It was everything I expected. Good food. Nice atmosphere. It didn't blow me away, but I can't say anything bad about it."}
{"text":"Just got back from here. 'Twas a mini-reunion of sorts with two guys I used to work with at Circus Circus Adventuredome. Actually, we had planned to hit up Kona Grill's HH, but not finding a place to sit in the designated HH patio area, we headed over to Gordon Biersch.  It was OK. I enjoyed my two $5 Dragon Fruit Strawberry Mojitos. We also shared a Slider Combo and two orders of the Potato Chip Nachos. I wasn't blown away by the food, but we enjoyed it. We really just needed a venue for our catching up and their outside patio area served that purpose nicely. Also, it's starting to get chilly out, but their space heaters are very effective."}
{"text":"The last time I went here was at the Honolulu location in 2000. From what I could recall, they had pretty good food so I thought we would give it a shot. I didnt want to disappoint since I suggested it to my family that was visiting from Iowa.  I called ahead to make arrangements since there was 9 in our party. They were very accomodating and seated us right away, to my surprise since it was a Saturday.  Our waitress was VERY friendly and was very attentive. Our drinks were refilled promptly and without us even having to ask, or having to remind her what we were drinking.   I ordered the Pulled Pork and Garlic Fries and the hubby ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger. We ended up sharing off of each others plates because the food was so good. The garlic fries and ranch are awesome!!!  At the end of our meal we ordered the Warm Apple Bread Pudding w/ whiskey sauce. It was very delicous, the whiskey sauce was the perfect compliment.  I know this is a beer place but I dont drink...I know, how do you go to Vegas and NOT drink, I promise you it can be done LOL  Wish this place wasnt so far away, but def next time I'm in Vegas I will pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends here for an afternoon drink and a light bite and we had a great time. Service was really nice and the food was pretty good.  I must say I love the patio where you can sort of see a lot of Mill and when the weather is great (like it was the day we were there) I don't know why anyone would sit inside.  We'll be back for sure, honestly I don't think it's anything off the charts or unique but it's a great place to hang out from time to time."}
{"text":"A large group of us decided to go out here tonight.  As another reviewer stated, the garlic fries smelled amazing (Although I didn't have any) walking through the restaurant.  We debated on sitting inside or outside and chose outside since the weather was nice.  When we got out there they had the misters running which normally would be a good idea I'm sure since it's the middle of the desert, but it was totally unnecessary tonight.  Of the 8 adult males at our table all 8 were nearly shivering, shirts, table, menus, appetizers, etc were all wet too.  We asked the waitress to see if they could turn it down or off, didn't hear anything back, asked again about 20 minutes later and the response was that she could go ask the manager if we wanted her to but that would mean that she was going to sweat her ass off for 8 hours (Direct quote)...which tells me that she completely blew us off the first time.  So I did notice that our table was up on an elevated part of the patio which places us closer to the misters.  Pretty bad design, it may be worth looking into nozzles with a different flow rate or just capping off every other one on that level of the patio.  Additionally, the restaurant was just not that busy and our food still came out piecemeal, with one in our party waiting an extra 10 minutes for his food, and everything was just slow.  Experience aside, I ordered the seafood stew and it was great.  All sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor.  There was enough but it was balanced and the real unique thing was the fennel.  I've never had fennel in a seafood soup before and it was perfect, I think it offset the fishiness enough to keep it from being one dimensional."}
{"text":"Was in the area for the Coyotes-LA Kings game and all the other restaurants in the arena/stadium area were crowded and had long waits 1 1/2 hours before game...but Biersch had room at the bar...this was during happy hour for food.,..ordered a personal pizza for $5 and garlic fries for another $5....they were good....and it was great that I could eat without secondhand smoke seeping through....bar was inside on one side and outside on another...nice fireplace outside... bartender Rachel was real sweet and great....after game wanted to wait for traffic to clear so Biersch it was again...Rachel wasn't there and got Suzi as a server....Suzi was also a sweetheart and a doll and was always smiling...and was frisky in a friendly way....something that you rarely see now a days...you want to spend more and tip a lot when ladies are like that...ended up staying till midnight and I offered Suzi a $20 tip on a $26 bill...she wouldn't take it and wanted me to tip 20 percent instead...she gave me a hug and it was nice...I told her I'd be back the next day after the Cardinals game....returned just after half time...and Suzi was there and happy to see me...every time Suzi came by she gave a hug or pat or rub on the back...if I lived in PHX we would probably be friends...stayed until about 8 when it got to be time to go home....this time she accepted a $20 tip on a $27 bill after a little prodding...Suzi asked when I would be back...I said probably not until next year...she said she'd probably move to Seattle before then to go to school....that would be a big loss for Biersch because Suzi is one of the best servers I've ever had...I could have gone to many other places that didn't charge as much for food and drinks but didn't want to take a chance on less than pleasant staff and came back to a sure thing...to Biersch because of Rachel and Suzi."}
{"text":"Met some friends in town who were here for your typical convention. They were staying near the restaurant. Stopped in during happy hour. Overpriced happy hour appetizers. They were a rip off. Very small portions for the happy hour price. The pizza was disgusting along with the tiny sliders of dry meat. The server either had too many tables and was very slow. Took forever to keep flagging her down for a beer. I had some of my friends food and no one like their meals.....I recommend go somewhere else! I don't get how this place gets business.....Oh from convention goers.  Actually, the Yard House has larger, cheaper, and better quality appetizers for happy hour...Go there."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. The food is okay, but I really enjoyed the beer. I'm a Hefeweizen guy and their hefe was solid."}
{"text":"Dog friendly times ten! I am a regular at this restaurant for their Happy Hour specials, which they have every single day. I like that the patio is open seating and you can sit wherever you like. I never have a wait time when I go to this restaurant (even on Mother's Day!).   Their pet policy is that dogs are welcome as long as they don't cause a problem. My dog is very relaxed, so I'm lucky, but they go above and beyond to make even his experience pleasant. He gets his plastic cup of water and the passer-by's stop to tell him how cute he is and pet him as he sits on the ledge of the patio.   It really is the perfect spot for a weekly Happy Hour where you can relax and enjoy the Vegas weather.   The San Francisco lemonade mixed drink is phenomenal but he sangria martini had WAYY too much sour.  Typically their drinks are spot on and I'm always a fan of the $5 mixed drink specials.  As for appetizers, the baja tacos (in fish or steak) are super good and I get them every time I'm there. Occasionally, I'll get another appetizer dish and so far the only appetizer I was unhappy with were the potstickers.  There can be a bit of a lag time when it comes to the servers, but their fantastic service more than makes up for the wait. Kudos to the management and the staff!"}
{"text":"We brought my parents here from out of town after a tour of ASU. As a starter, we ordered the crab artichoke dip which tasted like a frozen dish warmed in the oven before serving. It came with a few toast points and tortillas which were over buttered. My mom ordered the chopped salad which was a nice size portion but the chicken was difficult to find amongst the lettuce. My father ordered the beef tenderloin salad. The dressing was a warm bacon version which was overly sweet and greasy. The salad had 4 small strips of tenderloin which was the toughest cut of meat any of us had ever seen. The spinach was wilting and tasted a few days old. My husband and I shared the California flat bread. The base was solid and tasty but the greens were again wilted and old and the avocado was starting to brown. My side salad lettuce tasted like the lettuce hadn't been washed and was also sour. The best part of the salad was the jalapeño ranch dressing. Our server rarely came by our table,  only to take and deliver orders and bring the check. We waited 15 minutes for our check once we were done picking through our dishes. There were 10 college students working tonight for about 5 parties of customers. Overall we had a terrible experience and it was an awful $75 spent."}
{"text":"I am pretty much done with this place. When your food comes out 10 minutes after the food from the table next to you and they ordered 10 minutes after you, your order was lost, it was not because the kitchen was slammed.  When you tell me three times in a ten minute period that my food will be out in a couple of seconds, that is called lying.   On a happier note, this was the first time the pork chop was actually good.   This place could still be better managed especially for what they are charging."}
{"text":"What a great place. Always love the happy hour here. Always good, friendly service ! We stop in every couple weeks for guaranteed good food and a cold beer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place . The have TV screens with a game on that you can actually here the game . The happy hour food I ordered was tasty . The Bloody Mary was strong not a wreak pour at all. No complaints for that . Our waitress was very attentive to us . That to me is awesome especially in a bar with a happy hour and football going on."}
{"text":"Eh, that's all. We ordered the German cheese and sausage plate as it was the special. Unfortunately there was nothing special about it, the bread sucked, the meats were whatever/nothing I couldn't get myself in the low-cost pre-packaged deli isle of Safeway. The cheese sauce did not taste like anything it was described to be and the mustard was super generic. My Bloody Mary was decent and BF's beer was seasonal and good....will not venture to anothe GBB for a very long time with so many other excellent options out there. Very dissapointed in the meet/cheese board and the price. Service was whatever...we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and my boyfriend's second time so we didn't totally know what to expect. We came in on Friday night around 8pm.   From the time we walked in we were impressed. The hostesses were genuinely friendly and helpful, and we were seated right away. Our waitress, Becca, was also friendly and knew both the drink and food menus well. Some people just have the right personality for working in customer service jobs, and she was definitely one of them. Only complaint was that we had to wait to get our silverware a while after our food was delivered, but apart from that we were really satisfied!   The food was amazing! I don't remember the last time I've gone out to a restaurant and left my plate completely cleared! Their garlic fries are absolutely delicious, and the grilled cheese I had was the best I've ever eaten. My boyfriend had the salmon and not only enjoyed it, but cleared his plate as well.   We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wish I would've read the reviews before eating here, Red Robin would've been a better option. Had calamari as an appetizer, was really disappointed that it ha NO flavor at all, didn't like the white sauce that came with it and marinara really didn't taste like much either. Ordered a California burger for dinner and that too was totally bland, I NEVER salt my food even when cooking but had to add some to my burger bc the only flavor I could taste was the char from the grill, the few fries I did eat were actually pretty good and the best part of the meal. Service wasn't too bad, but no one cared to clear the table, also our waitress wasn't too responsive to checking on us or even when I told her about the calamari.  As soon as we walked out I had severe abdominal pain and felt like I was going to vomit in the parking lot, thankfully I live close by and was able to make it home before anything happening. Needless to say, I won't be dining at Gordon Biersch again."}
{"text":"Our server Emily was very good.  She was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was very good although I the kids burger was not impressive.  The ribeye was done very well and the turkey ciabatta was awesome!  The seafood Cobb salad was also very good.  We don't frequent this place often but would definitely come back when in the area again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2 star based on the food.  Our server Danny was very helpful and kind hearted we could tell. I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad and it came out and it smelled terrible/ tasted awful. Not sure if it was the plate, chicken, or dressing but it tasted off. The few bites I had made me sick to my stomach. Danny quickly replaced it for me and I tried the Burger & Sweet Fries which was decent. Then noticing my soda glass had brown crusted stuff inside the glass after I drank it just was the icing on the cake. Nasty! Danny was great, like I said and you could tell he genuinely cared but food was icky.  Thank you Danny again"}
{"text":"I've been to Gordon Biersch several times over the last 8-10 years and my experiences have been good, but not entirely consistent. Our recent visit was prompted by a group dinner with co-workers, so we were situated in one of their private dining rooms and a set menu. The group ordered a couple extra appetizers as well.  Bruschetta: Served with toasted crostini. This didn't seem particularly fresh and was so overpowered by garlic. I really do love garlic, but that was basically all you could taste. The crostini was rubbed with garlic and grilled, so they were really nice by itself, but too much with the bruschetta.  Fried Calamari: Served with marinara and spicy lemon remoulade. The calamari was okay; tasty, but not tender and too little squid to batter ratio. Enjoyed the marinara.  Crispy Crab Risotto Fritters: Crab, pancetta and havarti in creamy risotto, served over spicy lemon remoulade. Good fritters and the spicy lemon remoulade worked much better with this appetizer.  Southwest Egg Rolls: Stuffed with pulled chicken, black beans, corn, roasted red peppers, carrots, zucchini and pepper jack cheese. Delicious! Flavorful, crispy exterior, and great dipping sauce.  Classic Caesar Salad: Your usual suspects. Decent salad.  Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Pasta: Chicken, tomato, mushroom, herbs, beer-infused gorgonzola cream sauce, bowtie pasta. Another shrug. The beer-infused gorgonzola cream gets an 'A' for effort.  Steak Frites: 7 oz Cab top sirloin with Gorgonzola Garlic sauce and Legendary Garlic Fries. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly medium rare. I really liked the gorgonzola garlic sauce! The garlic fries were really awesome this time. (I've had really bad ones in the past)  Triple Chocolate Brownie: Caramel and chocolate sauces. Lacked the moisture and tenderness of a really good brownie, but still good.  Across the board, food is just okay with nothing remotely special. I would say that it was a decent spot for beer and eats, but there are so many new spots in Vegas that serve up great beers and equally amazing food. I would return for Garlic Fries only."}
{"text":"I've never been impressed with this place, yet my parents keep wanting to come back. There's nothing special about it: the food is mediocre and the vibe is dead. I feel like the only time this place gets busy is when there's games at the stadium. Probably would be a good place to get a drink but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Never had bad service, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"We generally really enjoy the food at Gordon Biersch. Yesterday was an exception to the rule. Our calamari came out barely lukewarm. My husband's hamburger also lukewarm. My fish tacos were the poorest excuse for fish tacos I've ever had a tiny little piece of fish that was overcooked. My husband salad looked like it came out of a bag and was wilted. The blue cheese dressing was good however.   The manager was sent over by our server. He thanked us for letting him know in a polite way and compted our whole meal!  Never had that done before!  What a classy thing to do!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I gave a five because of one of their servers, yes the food was yummy and flavorful as usual. But the customer service was perfect, our waiter made our Sunday day date a wonderful experience. Thank you David for making our day and for the fantastic service. And thank you again for the 9er shirt I will pay it forward. Ask for davids section you will enjoy your dining experience."}
{"text":"Obtained a coupon for a free beer from the Annual Bite of Las Vegas and decided we'd drop by before heading to the Yelp Redline Rendezvous event.   Service was not very good.  The waitress wasn't super friendly and their food runner was extremely rude. He snapped at one of my friends when they forgot to bring the sauce that he had requested at the time he placed the order. That's never okay.  And when we presented our coupons to the waitress, one for my fiancé and one for myself, she seemed annoyed.  Bad customer service always irks me.  I've been in customer service my whole life and their attitudes weren't acceptable.   Well, after the terrible service the beer just didn't taste very good.  They brew their own beer and only have their own brews on tap.  The red ale was probably my favorite of what they had but it's not worth the trip back. Yes, they have some good happy hour deals with $3 beers but I'm sure I can find that deal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Of the 5 years I attend ASU and the 7 I've been in Tempe, last night was the first time I'd been to Gordon Biercsch. A friend was back in town visiting and he picked this place to meet up with some local friends. They have a prime location on Mill with 2nd floor overlook Mill Ave and A Mountain. Our group of 9 was seated in the bar and our service was good - can't complain. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries and a Kentucky Peach drink. The drink was forgettable, especially for $10. The entree was also okay - it wasn't bad, but it was nothing I would make a trip back for. I would say though that because of the view, I would probably come back for happy hour on the balcony since it is so gorgeous."}
{"text":"Loved the beer on tap! Many selections to choose from. Was at GB when the Rose Bowl (BCS) game was on. The bartender with the Mohawk was friendly and the service was good. Didn't try any food at this location."}
{"text":"The waitress decided she was intellectually smarter than us and gave us substandard service which ended up saving me 50% off my normal tip. Glad she was so \"smart\", I appreciate the savings."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at GB in Az, but this one is not good!!! There are about a thousand better choices in Vegas, don't waste your time here. Read below for more. Went here in Valentine's because we were staying across the street and didn't wanna go into the strip. We also got a coupon from the front counter at the La Quinta across the street which was nice. The service started out like crap and picked up toward the end. I got the marzen bbq burger. It was like 13 bucks so I had high expectations. My burger was ordered medium and came out WELL done and NOT hot. In fact NONE of our food was hot! I subbed the fries for asparagus because we got the garlic fries for an appetizer. The fries tasted good, but weren't hot. The asparagus was cooked well with a good char but no spice at all. And again came out barely warm. My wife got a salad and it was okay, but the greens didn't taste fresh to me. I told my server about the burger which I could barely eat half of because it was so over cooked and he offered free dessert. I kinda just wanted it taken off but I was still hungry so I settled for the triple brownie with ice cream. The dessert looked good, but again, it came out barely warm expect the very middle, I'm pretty sure they microwave it for 30 seconds and bring it out. It was a little bitter for my taste. I prefer a decadent brownie and maybe a little more moist. It was rather dry considering it's price. I got it for free so I can't complain too much, but it was only free because they messed up the burger too. I have never had a bad experience at GB in Az, but this one is not good!!! There are about a thousand better choices in Vegas, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for my daughter and her friends. Saturday, May 24th my daughter and her group (6 all together) had made 6:30 dinner reservations the previous week. They arrived at the restaurant, needless to say was not busy, and sat down. To wrap up the whole night/situation was the service was slow and non attentive. I don't know whether the fact that this was a group of 17 yr. old kids but the young lady that was their server that night had them wait 40 minutes before taking their order after telling her twice they were ready and her response was \"I'll be right back\" and never came back. The server's attitude was rude. 40 minutes to order, REALLY! They were celebrating a friends birthday, needless to say did not turn out to be very memorable."}
{"text":"My friend MM and I came here for dinner since it was close to our hotel and we figured it would be a safe option as a popular franchise restaurant. It is located in the Westgate entertainment complex with multiple other restaurants and plenty of parking. We were seated rather quickly at a booth, which was nice. But then the waiting began.  My theory is that one of the servers cancelled their shift at the last minute, because that's the only explanation I have for the amount of waiting we did. We waited a long time to order food, we waited a long time to get our food, we waited a long time to get our check... there was a lot of waiting involved. And the restaurant was not even packed! Therefore I think that someone cancelled their shift at the last minute and our server had to handle more tables than normal and that is why we had to wait so long for everything. If this was not the case, then it was just shitty service and I would prefer to give our server the benefit of the doubt, especially since she was quite nice every time we did interact with her.  I started off my evening with their BOURBON PEACH SMASH ($8.99), which has Maker's Mark, peach puree, and lemon lime sour. I thought I had taken a photo of it but I guess I just really needed a drink and I forgot to. Sorry! The drink was decent... I don't really have much to say about it.  For my meal I got their CALIFORNIA BURGER ($11.99), which has crushed avocado, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, 1000 Island dressing. It also comes with either your choice of side of their Infinite Legendary Garlic Fries. With a name like that, of course I had to get the Infinite Legendary Garlic Fries! I was happy with my burger--I love avocado and all the ingredients went together quite well. The garlic fries were delicious; I love garlic and they were quite generous with it. Since they are Infinite I also got a second serving of the fries, although I felt bad that I didn't finish them.  My friend ordered a burger as well, and he added bacon to it. The burger came out without bacon, so we flagged our server down and asked that she make sure that we do not get charged for the bacon. MM heard her tell someone to take off the bacon charge, but I guess that someone did not listen, since the $1.59 charge for bacon was there on the receipt when we got the bill! So we had to wait some more to flag our server down again, then wait some more for her to bring the corrected bill, and then wait some more for her to bring back the bill and our credit cards. All the waiting left my friend pretty bitter, so he was definitely not a fan of this place. He would probably give them 2 stars, but I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and I did enjoy my food and drink, so I will give them 3 stars. They were okay."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and family after having just moved here. The atmosphere was great and they had good beer and cocktails. The waiter was excellent and very friendly. He remebered our order without every writing anything down and got everything correct, even though we were difficult with our orders. The food was excellent and the server constantly made sure we were taken care of. Defenitaley reccomend!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best thing about Gordon Biersch is sitting on the balcony to watch the sunset. Beautiful view.  The beers are overpriced, but tasty. The food is quite honestly, meh. Nothing memorable except for the garlic fries. The service each time I have visited has been terrible. Inattentive servers, empty glasses, empty plates.   Go for the view and a beer and then go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Time for an update. What a shame, this place was one of my favorites and as a current Stein holder for more than 5 years I've seen a lot of turnover and ups and downs but I could always count on consistency.    However, last few times service has gotten worst.  I love sitting at the bar as I enjoy being in the mix of it all and talking with fellow patrons and the staff. Now it seems everyone is just going through the motions. Very impersonal lacking basic human connection.    I've always enjoyed the southwest egg rolls and the Cajun pastas, but again these last few times the food seems rushed from the kitchen and poorly executed. Hopefully management catches on because things will get harder with a Thirsty Lion opening up next door soon.   Still love my Stein and I'll stay loyal, but miss the old days!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times now and it's hit or miss.  You can't miss with the burgers or the garlic fries.  Tried a salad recently - pear gorganzola with pecan crusted chicken.  Sounded great but boy was this dull - no flavor to be found anywhere including the abundant boring dressing.  Chicken was thin, dried out and also flavorless.  Friends had better success with tacos, chicken sandwiches and yes, burgers.  Sticking with a burger is probably the best plan, move away from that and you might get an unpleasant surprise."}
{"text":"It's a brewery, a bar and a restaurant. After walking in, a host/hostess is asking if you would like a table or sit at the bar.  If you choose to sit at the bar or around the bar area, you can go ahead and find a seat, or a table around it.  Our waitress came by immediately, gave us the menu, plus the happy hour menu, and asked if we like to try one of their beers. I personally don't drink any beer. I really like this place for their bar food! Especially at Happy Hour.  I ordered Fish Tacos. They are perfectly prepared. The sauce is very spicy (good if you like spicy food). It's not listed spicy on the menu, so be prepared. I also ordered pepperoni pizza. They only make personal size pizzas, so everyone can order whatever they like! I love their pizza! Thin crust, baked in a wood-fired oven.  Previously I ordered the California sandwich, it's grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and avocado. Love, love, love their garlic fries! Lots of fresh garlic on it! My other favorite is the New York steak sandwich. Real New York steak on a sub roll.  NY Steak dinner with mashed potato and asparagus. It's a hit and miss! Many times meat is not cooked perfectly. Well, it's not a steakhouse, so I am not going to be outrageous, but for $29 entree, I expect some decent meal.  My BF also tried many different items, too. Sliders from HH menu very good! Only $5.- Their sausages were also very tasty.  For dessert I ordered Strawberry Cheesecake, and it was okay, better than I thought.  Service is always great. Waitresses are very attentive, especially when alcoholic beverages were ordered!   The place is always very loud. Music is always playing on the background.  Television sets are playing sports with captions on. Lots of TV-s everywhere!  Of course the place is always packed, so be prepared.  I like to try their Sunday brunch sometimes, so I am sure we will be back again, sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I came here with 2 other couples and our 5 kids a couple of weeks ago. We had to wait forever for our table but it was packed so I understand how that goes. Our server seemed scared when he saw all of the kiddos in our group..which I found pretty funny. That apparently effected him through out the meal since he was not doing a very good job. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with some really yummy garlic fries. The burger was done proper and was really fresh as far as the toppings went. Those fries were addicting. We also had a plate of homemade potato chips that are loaded with bacon & cheese..those were even better than the fries. They get 5 stars! So if you go there and get \"Skippy\" the waiter..good luck. LOL Lets just hope he was having an off day... Oh..the beer I had was perfect...love the beer here!"}
{"text":"Went here for my traveling project happy hour celebration.  The food was good but typical bar food.  Pizza, chicken tenders, etc.  The food was plentiful.  The drinks were good.  I had a white wine and mixed drink - both were good and they had a nice selection for a Brewery in college town Tempe."}
{"text":"Bartender Christopher is seriously the worst bartender ever. SOOOOO in-attentive and rude."}
{"text":"Two stars for friendly service at the bar.  Zero stars for their 'famous' garlic fries being tossed in CANOLA OIL after frying. They come out underdone and SOGGY w/grease which turns out to be a GMO, terribly unhealthy oil.  Also, why on earth the few TVs behind the bar aren't HD is anyone's guess, but certainly inexcusable.  Happy hour food discounts range from just a dollar to a few dollars.  They were \"out\" of avocados and all flat breads for some strange reason."}
{"text":"We're so done with this place.  Years ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave, or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun. Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointments. A couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold, tasteless food. A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again. This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits, and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try.  Today we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone. We sat in the self seating area near the bar. Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides. While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them!! I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her. She apologized and took the glasses. A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said, \"Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay.\" Are you effing kidding me!? Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold, and absolutely tasteless. We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left.   Seriously, if you're looking for a fabulous burger, great beer, excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please take the time and go to the San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area. You won't be disappointed! As my dad would say, they could sell their burgers in India they're so good. http://www.santanbrewing.com/ However, if you're in Tempe and don't want to drive all the way to Chandler (and okay with fighting for parking) try Four Peak's Brewery, they're also fantastic.  http://www.fourpeaks.com/"}

{"text":"Gordon Biersch is close to a hotel I use when in Vegas on business. I've eaten here several times, over a two-year period, and used to like the place. But, my recent experiences have been disappointing.  Things got off to a poor start when we were seated at an unstable table that rocked like a small boat on the high seas.  We were told that was the only available table...but it wasn't.  We insisted on being reseated and another table became magically available after we challenged the \"no other tables\" explanation.  We were re seated, and ordered a couple of their in-house microbrews. The beers were OK but lacked character, perhaps my memories of their beer were incorrect, or perhaps they have a new brewmeister..maybe new recipes?   I ordered the new york steak and tempura shrimp combo and...well...the tempura shrimp are not like the light flakey  tempura you might find in a Japanese place. Gordon Biersch \"tempura\" seems to be  just battered shrimp, and the batter is little better than what you might find at a fast food place. The steak was more or less an Applebee's quality steak, and the garlic mashers were average at best.  I realize the prices here are less than on the strip...but come on.  You can beat Applebee's for God's sake.  Still, the place is conveniently located, so we went back again, a couple nights after our mediocre experience, hoping for a better outcome.    Nope.  This time the service was poor and their signature KOBE burger came well done when ordered medium rare. We had to get up and find our waiter to order a replacement.  Even the replacement burger was a disappointment:  A perfectly formed hockey puck of beef (read made in a burger press), a slice of cheese that looked like a Kraft single, a very basic bun, a tiny side of fries and not much else.  We then had to ask twice for some ketchup for the fries. When the best thing you can say about a $14 burger is \"the bun was fresh\" it's not a good value.  All in all, I see no reason to give them a 5th chance."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my mom's birthday. We had a big party this is why I made the reservation a week ahead of time.  We were all cramped together so I had to ask for not one, but two more tables to accommodate us comfortably.  The second table we had move ourselves because no one would assist our server. Our server Lilly was extremely nice. She was the only one assisting a party of 20 people.   The food was okay not spectacular. My husband's garlic mashed potatoes were hard and cold.  My brother's burger was rare and not well done. So they had to send it back. When then did bring it back everyone else was already finish eating. The even brought it back with the same cold fries.  They salads  were great and filling.  Everything else everyone order was mediocre. My chicken for the GB chicken  and mushrooms was over cooked and dry.  The apple bread pudding was amazing. Rich and flavorful. The drinks from the bar were good and very strong.  Gordon's is good place to go for happy and hour not dinner."}
{"text":"I agree with the viewer that said there's nothing memorable about this restaurant except for the outdoor seating and the garlic fries. I recreated the dish at home so I don't really feel the need to eat here anymore."}
{"text":"These guys have nailed perfection.  Seriously.  The root beer is a delight.  The chicken is tender and juicy.  The shrimp is sinfully delicious!   Everything here is amazing and chances are, you won't leave with a to go box!"}
{"text":"In Vegas, happy hours are a dime and dozen.  They have happy hour before dinner...happy hour after dinner.  Also labled as \"reverse happy hour\"  Took advantage of \"reverse happy hour\".  Calamari was pretty fresh, with crispy outside.  Nice kicked up marinara sauce to cover it.  Garlic fries ordered by tablemate were way overrated.  They were on the soggy side, but they were seasoned decently. Mai tai was disappointing.  Didn't have the right blend of mixings, and I won't excuse the fact that it was on the happy hour menu.  It still can be done right!  Huge facility, clean bathrooms.  Indoor seating with huge comfy booths.  Outdoor area with wire seating chairs, warming lights (in Vegas?), and little lanterns at each table."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but I do find it a bit on the pricey side for lunch. I usually come here when I am working so rarely do I get to indulge in the craft beers on tap.   I really enjoy sitting out on the patio when the weather allows although service can be a slow. Sometimes I think they forget I am sitting out there. They have a nice seasonal menu (great crab cakes) and the garlic fries are a must. (Just make sure you bring mints because they are powerful)."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."}
{"text":"Seems like lunch hour crowds around the Westgate area is scarce. This place happen to be more welcoming than others. Soup of the day was chicken tortilla soup. Maybe I heard wrong or ate too fast, but I didn't remember any chicken chunks or tortilla pieces. But the grass-fed beef sliders were excellent, especially with tomatoes and Brie cheese!  We ordered them medium rare. So it was moist and tender and juicy. Service and friendly staff is what helped this place get the 4-star rating!"}
{"text":"I just have to say this place is okay over priced a bit for the quality of the food. I am not a beer drinker my BF is he liked the beer that would be like a stella. other than that I don't think we will return. The menu was not impressive at all."}
{"text":"Pretty descent food, nice atmosphere.  Also has outside seating with swamp cooling.  Really reminded me of the RAM restaurant (brewery with food)."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Fatty ribeye. Others who were with us said their food was blah and had no flavor. Waitress forgot to take someone in our groups order so he got his food after we were half done. None of us will go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, Food was good but I've had much better. Very clean, Nice restrooms, open bar."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Gordon Biersch I've eaten at and all three have been great.  Great beer and great food with a fun and classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Service, Great Food, and the atmosphere is always enjoyable. Try the Kobe Burger its the best! Great place to catch a game!"}
{"text":"The Gordon Biersch on Mill is top notch. The location is quite honestly one of the best parts--you're on Mill and 5th and the patio (2nd story) faces the east, southeast, and direct south. You have to go up a flight or two of stairs before you actually enter the restaurant, but once you're almost all the way up, you'll find the bar and open seating to your right and the rest of the dining room to the left. Great views of Tempe, Mill, West 6th, and the distant mountains.  I've had the pleasure of meeting the brewmaster of this Gordon Biersch and he runs a very precise and sanitary operation with the little room he has. The brewery that you can see behind the bar is pretty much it--there aren't any other tanks other than those. Even so, the taps are always flowing.  Food here is good but it is pretty expensive if you're not coming during happy hour. Due to the price, I usually just grab a beer or two with a side of garlic fries. They have the BEST garlic fries on the street. Very satisfying stuff.  I would recommend Gordon Biersch as a lunch or dinner spot, but there are much better places on Mill for late night adventuring."}
{"text":"5 star service, 0 star food. Sorry Gordon! bad Ceaser sauce, bad classic salad. ( tasteless). Sliders bread was not a burger bread and it was crunchy toasted. This was our second trial. We didn't give bad grade the first time. No more trials, with this kind of foid, BJ's or Cheesecake Factory is better. Pleae upgrade your cooks and menu."}
{"text":"Garlic fries made our drinks taste bad. Fish and chips are good. Need to train waitress with red hair to pay attention to party of six instead of ignoring us for table of two right next to us.  We are waving check around trying to pay and we are still getting ignored."}
{"text":"Just waiting for a lecture and sat down at the bar. Bartender very friendly and when I asked for a \"stout\" she accurately chose a dark beer for me. I'm happy with my beer and it makes me want to stay and try some appetizers.  After the lecture..."}
{"text":"A friend took me to lunch here to thank me for helping her unpack her house.  Started with a Marzen and some \"legendary\" garlic fries.  The fries were good but didn't live up to the hype.  Then we moved on to several different appetizers.  Fish tacos - delish.  Mediterranean Nachos  - pretty ok.  Filet Minion slider - very very good (love the onions) Blue Crab/Artichoke Dip - HOLD THE PHONE!  This was heaven on a piece of toast and I seriously thought I might have to choke my friend out if she kept shoveling it in her mouth.  Good news, we are still friends but agreed we will be ordering our own next time.  Oh yeah, after my second Marzen I had a wonderful buzz and a great afternoon nap.  Will be returning!!  The only \"eh\" I have is the price but I'm poor.  Also heard some rumblings about having your own beer locker there to store a special mug that gets you discounted beer.  Will be looking into this when I have the funds."}
{"text":"The Marzen is what I usually drink here. The Southwest Egg Rolls are tasty. The bartender and waiting staff is top notch."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Gordon biersch location for many many years and their food qualify has been sliding steadily.  But each time we gave another try hoping it would be better. But this time they hit the rock bottom. My wife had salmon fillet which tasted like it has been soaked in salt for a week. She managed to eat two third of it and we put the rest in a doggie box. I had their SIGNATURE ribeye steak. I don't know where they got it but it was toughest ribeye I've ever chewed on. I ate little over half of 12 oz steak. My jaws were getting tired from chewing. Rest of it went into the doggie box. Side of garlic fries was very salty and soggy. But what do you know....my dog loved salmon fillet and ribeye steak. I'm sure he would given them 10 stars."}
{"text":"Since Outback was packed for days We ventured towards mill and decided on GB  I've always been a fan of GB I called ahead just in case and the girl at the front put us down, even though she said there would be no wait  You can never be too sure  We were seated on the western part of the dining room and we were both kinda worried  We didn't think we were going to get any service, let alone drinks...  But our server Steven, was absolutely great He was in charge of a pretty large section but he made sure to visit each table and take care of everything  I would not be able to do that   He was great in recommendations and was super knowledgable of the menu  I went for the Cajun chicken pasta with a golden export beer The pasta was really good It was nice and spicy and had chicken, shrimp, and sausage The beer was yummy as well  Steven made sure to check on us periodically and was very nice and could carry a short convo  He really made the entire dining experience wonderful  A job well done  We will be back"}
{"text":"Decent beer, decent prices.  They have AWESOME happy hour specials that run from 5-7 and then again 9-closing which was 1am but the manager was trying to push us out at 12.  The waitress said at 11:45 it was last call.  Now I know I haven't lived in this city for awhile but last I checked there is no such thing as \"last call\" in Las Vegas.     Either way we got several of the late night specials on the happy hour menu.  The house made chips w/blue cheese were so good I swear if I wasn't with 4 other people I may have licked the plate just sayin....  We also got the egg rolls and chicken wings they were good but probably wouldn't order again.  After those chips everything was compared to them though and they alone are worth the trip.  The artichoke hearts were delicious as well.  The beer we got was the Heifenweizer which is the first time I had their version of it.  It was very different, good but a taste I could not put my finger on.     I think if your going to Gordon Biersch I would go to the one near downtown that one just has more going on and I don't think they close and have that foreign words I heard in Las Vegas 'last call'."}
{"text":"Nice hang out, great atomosphere, excellent happy hour and close to the Convention Center.  I always visit when I am at the LVCC for a show, but lately it has become a regular happy hour place.  They brew their own beer, several types, there is something for everyone.  I prefer the Marzen, they also have excellent seasonals.  The food menu is updated regularly with a nice mix of appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"Not bad, decent beer, food, and prices. While there is nothing that made it stand out, there is nothing negative I can say about it either. I just drove by it last night & thought meh. It's very mediocre. With all of the other great options in Vegas, I don't think it will be worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I really love the location and drink menu here. However; the food has been consistently miserable.  I've come back here multiple times hoping for some type of flavor redemption. The only thing that's consistent is terrible food. This place could be one of the best places in San Tan Village but they have fallen short; even compared to Dairy Queen's fantastic frozen quality.   This place will be a location to go after I eat a good dinner elsewhere; to get obliterated just to forget about how shameful GB's food is."}
{"text":"Overall this place has been okay. From my childhood memories and these legendary garlic fries definitely don't disappoint from the several years ago I was here. I do think some of the menu items are slightly overpriced for what we received. The wonton nachos my buddy got were definitely not what you'd think of when you get nachos, very minimal on toppings. The presentation of the gluten free california burger was slightly lackluster; but still a juicy delicious hunk of meat. Overall I feel as if the effort of customer service has been not up to par as expected. When I thought of this places fantastic German influenced style; I imagined the lively bar atmosphere, this just didn't deliver. What I will say is the taste was amazing and the server did a stupendous job at keeping our drinks refilled. The place is awesomely clean and still deserving of a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything I've eaten here was delicious and we love their beers. Great fancy upscale vibe, but you don't have to be upscale to eat here. We love going straight into the bar area or sitting outside. Service here has always been great, very prompt and I don't think they've ever let me finish a beer without asking if I wanted another one. Nice.  And that's even when they're busy."}
{"text":"Generally, I am pleased with GBB but tonight was so disappointing! We were provided with happy hour menus and when I started to order the food from happy hour i was told that they don't do happy hour at this location if there's an \"event\"! I'm okay with that policy but don't hand me a menu with the happy hour items and then change your mind!! put up a notification so I can decide before I come in! Disappointed"}
{"text":"I would have given one star but the fries were yummy and our waitress, Jennifer, was on her A game.   We came for dinner. I was hesitant of the Octoberfest menu, so i ordered from the Chefs selection, Gorgonzola ribeye with fries   Sans gorgonzola and flavor. The steak was burnt and the mushrooms for the side tasted canned. The fries were the saving grace.   After dinner I hoped for a redemption, however that wasn't to be. After ordering brownie with ice cream I gave up. The brownie was hard and had no density. At least the ice cream was cold.   Next time, I don't think there will be one."}
{"text":"I've been to GB a half dozen times now and I have to say that I really like this place. I don't care if it is a chain or not - if I like what you are doing and I enjoy the food then you have me as a customer.   For me, GB is one of my favorite places to stop on the weekend around lunchtime to grab a beer and bite to eat after I've been out running errands. I like them for their burgers and sandwiches more than the other menu items, which is probably why I find myself eating here more frequently for lunch than for dinner.   In the beer department they do not disappoint. They have a really nice selection of craft beers to choose from, and two of my  favorites are the Märzen and FestBier (seasonal).   As far as food goes, I really like their burgers here. Yes, they are more expensive here than other places - but they also fit into a category of burger where I expect to pay more for what I am getting. The Märzen BBQ burger and Classic cheeseburgers are pretty tasty, but overall my favorite burger here is the Kobe Black and Blue. If you are a blue cheese fan you have to order one of these. Cooked medium. Anything more is heresy.  The Classic BBQ Pork and the Märzen BBQ Chicken sandwiches are also both good. The garlic fries here are my favorite. I normally don't eat a lot of fries, although whenever I'm here you will not find a single fry left on my plate.   I have also had the Gorgonzola ribeye, which was good, but it left me feeling a little disappointed. If I compare this to a similar steak at Firebird's, there is a huge difference in flavor. I just wasn't as impressed with this entree compared to the other menu items.   As far as service goes, my wife and I have never had a problem here. We've always been seated right away, had our orders taken promptly and received our food relatively quickly.   Overall, a nice place to grab lunch or just relax and enjoy a drink while snacking on something!"}
{"text":"went in for lunch on my birthday. for some reason, i remembered them having lunch specials, which they actually dont.  started off with a cocktail. got the geisha. not what i expected, but i drank it anyway. i ordered the kobe sliders and a cup of the lobster bisque. the sliders were ok. they came with onion strings, which were actually really good. the lobster bisque was waaaaaaaay salty, even for my taste (i like salthy food...but that was more than my pallet could handle).  im not big on being the \"hey! its my birthday!\" person, so i said nothing. but i figured our server would have noticed its my birthday and at least say \"oh! happy birthday!\", but no. didnt even notice.   our check came out to a little over $45 for my boyfriends drink and sandwich, and my drink, sliders and soup, a little more than what i would have spent for it.  service was ok. i think he could tell we were really just there to eat, and didnt bother us too much. that - i appreciate. although he was fairly interactive with his other tables, who seemed to be regulars there.  i remember coming here before, and i cant remember if i liked it or not. maybe not? maybe i'll have to come back for the beer, if i do come back."}
{"text":"I was attending an art class that was being held at this location, so my friend and I came early to take advantage of happy hour. The bar area was full, but not packed, and had maybe 3 or 4 servers, which wasn't quite enough.   We couldn't get anyone to actually approach our table to take our orders. The two times we were able to actually order anything, we had to flag someone down. It's like we were invisible. The tables around us were getting service, but no luck for us.   When my friend's drink finally arrived there was a bug floating in it. Again, when we FINALLY were able to flag someone down and tell her that there was a bug in the drink, she looked at us as though she pitied us for not understanding the value an insect can add to a cosmo, gave us the sympathetic head tilt and said, \"ummm...it's a fruit fly.\" Oh, well then. I didn't realize. I thought it was a bug, but now that I know it's a FRUIT FLY, I'd like to keep it. In fact, do you have a few more you could sprinkle atop my beverage? Thanks.  At least they didn't charge her for the drink. Oh, wait. THEY DID. Yes, we got to pay for the fruit fly cosmo, because, well, FRUIT FLY.  I hate chain restaurants anyway, and this experience did nothing to change my mind."}
{"text":"One star is a bit too much!  Place could be run better by a group of kindergarten 3rd grade students.  I have never been to a restaurant where 4 tables sat unbussed from the time I walked in until I left.  I will not be returning,  and I advise everyone to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Tempe ad they set the bar high. It was actually my second time at a Gordon Biersch location and I will say that this location is the better of the two. The location is super convenient, on the corner. It is upstairs. They have an elevator though.   The hostess allowed us to sit anywhere and we chose to sit at a table near the outdoor patio area. It was a bit too hot to sit outside, but I would say if the temperature is down, the outside dining area is probably the best dining view in the city.   I started with the Asian Chicken Bites which were crispy chicken bites tossed in an excellent Hawaiian teriyaki sauce with chiles, green onions and sesame seeds. The sweet lemon glaze was drizzled on the side of the plate, which was a bit odd, especially since we were sharing the starter. For my meal, I ordered the seafood cobb salad. It came with a hefty portion of shrimp and shredded crab, tomatoes, avocado, hard-boiled eggs, cucumbers, bacon, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. It was excellent and an overall above average portion. My friend ordered the salmon and was disappointed. We cracked up over the weird service. Our server admitted that he's OCD and kept stopping by our table, finally after three times of him asking if he could take away the chicken bites, I said: \"take them\".  Overall the food was excellent but the service was weird. My friend insisted that I'd called and told them that I was on the YES. No, we don't roll like that. But, I have to say service was strange and even the manager was a bit extra, even offering us free dessert."}
{"text":"such a good place to sit and have a few beers and grub on garlic fries. very roomy with a mellow feel. i liked it here alot. if you're not sure where to start.. they let you try the beer before you order it.. the pizza was just ok.. i've had better. the place was busy but it wasnt so noisy where you had to yell to have a conversation. really.. just a cool place to go to start off your night."}
{"text":"If I could get service on a regular basis, I'd maybe rate the food at 4/5 stars. But I've just about given up. This location has a major problem with spotty service, and you never know what you will get. Sometimes, it's great, with an attentive, personable server.  Just as likely you'll get completely ignored even when it's not busy. About 6 months ago, my husband contacted corporate about the problem. They were apologetic and seemed truly concerned, and even sent a $40 gift card as an apology. We've been back a few times since then, and I will miss the garlic fries and southwest chicken sandwich. But we won't be back. When  you're hungry and willing to spend $20 a person for a decent dinner, you don't want to play the lottery to see if you'll get service or not."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Sunday makes for a great deal. New Imperial Pilsner is tasty."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is a great place. I feel it is your typical restaurant bar served up in a more upscale type setting. The interior is darker colors with an outdoor patio, bar, high top seating, and a more formal dining area. It's a type of place that dims the lights after it gets dark out for a more cozy atmosphere. The servers are attentive and the drinks are good.   We ordered the burgers and, of course, the limitless (\"bottomless\") fries. Everything came out in a fair amount of time and the flavors were good. We've had their garlic fries before and they have, in the past, been overwhelming with the garlic but this time were prepared really well. The fries were probably my favorite part of the meal.   We joined their rewards program awhile back and when we did we got a free dessert. We had skipped dessert today but received $5.00 off our order through the rewards program. That was pretty cool considering we're not really regulars here but have been a couple of times.   Overall, the location was nice. It is more formal and a bit fancier of a place during dinnertime hours. They have a well stocked bar and the service was good. Food was equally good and the fries were BOMB! Join the free rewards program and start saving money - even if you only come once in awhile it seems to be pretty giving."}
{"text":"I had the grilled vegetable salad and the grass fed beef slider. Brent, the bartender sure knows his way around a mighty fine Mai tai."}
{"text":"Haven't had dinner here but reviews look good. Love fish and chips. Gotta try theirs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their happy hour! Due to the fact I work weird hours at work, I miss the 4-6pm happy hours around town. I found out that they do the reverse happy hour from 10pm-close every day. I got there with some friends at 10pm with awesome weather to dine outside in the patio. It didn't seem crowded, but I enjoyed the Southwestern 3 combo sampler  for $11. I had glasses of wine  which were $2 off, and their specialty cocktails are only $5, not bad at all. The service was very attentive for late night drinking in the patio. I will definitely frequent this place :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pecan salmon! So amazing! The burger was great too! The garlic fries are addictive and pungent! And the brownie was the best I'd ever had! Great place to blow the little winnings we did have."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great service. This location has a beautiful patio on the 2nd floor over looking Tempe. It's a great place to simply sit and have a drink with friends or enjoy a light dinner while taking in the wonderful fall weather in central Arizona."}
{"text":"This Gordon Biersch has an outstanding bar - one of the best in the area. The staff is friendly and really know their beer. Our waiter, Brent, suggested their seasonal brew - turned out to be an excellent choice. The appetizers are huge and very tasty.   Happy hour in effect all day on Sunday. We will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Superior food. Fabulous beer. We love this place, and this experience sealed the deal.   We were there for a friend's birthday party. The waitstaff (our waiter in particular) was positively the best I've ever experienced - bar none. Yes, I'm actually gushing. One guy to take care of our party of 10+ and he didn't miss a beat, didn't drop an order, kept us hydrated, and even joked with the kids. He and several others brought in the cake (that we brought from Costco), lit candles and led us in singing. He helped serve it, and even packaged it when we had more than half left over (we told them to share as much as they wanted with the staff).  Plus, the food - OMG! I shared an ahi appetizer, which led to me getting the lobster bisque (holy handbaskets, I died and went to heaven), then ordering the seared tuna dinner. The prices are not as high as you'd expect for this level of cuisine.  We went to the GB on Maryland for my birthday in November, and had a lovely time then, too. This one is our favorite, though."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken salad was good but not great. Love the burger and garlic fries. Menu was really dirty and service is ok but not great"}
{"text":"The service was good.   The menu selection was good.  The food choices were good,  but not great.   Pricey.  Overall good but not great."}
{"text":"I come here just because my friends like it. The food is not bad, somewhat pricey - except the pizzas, which are a good value. Beer is also a good value, but wine and other drinks are not. I'm personally not a fan of their beer - I find it too heavy and sweet, but if you want to get a group and get happy, this place is clean, geared to please, and its dishes are easy to share."}
{"text":"I had a work dinner here last night and we had a very nice time. Other than having to walk up a billion stares to get into the place everything was great. Being on the third floor you get a cool view of Mill Ave.   Probably a cool place to watch a game or get a happyhour drink after work.    We started in the bar for a happy hour cocktail. I tried the Pilsner they had on draft, very tasty.   They sat us at a nice table in the dinning room and the service was good. Nothing stood out as extraordinary, but there were no complaints from anyone. I would defiantly recommend and use them in the future."}
{"text":"Their happy hour compared to neighbors Kona Grill and Brio is not good at all.  Expensive, greasy, and plain.  Do yourself a favor and takes 100 steps to the left!!  Kona all the way!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Really crappy service. Past the hostesses, not a single staffer seemed to care about their patrons at all. They weren't attentive and in the back you could see them folding napkins, yawning, talking. The server that dropped off the food at the table nearly literally \"dropped\" them, messing up any presentation the cooks had made and nearly dropping it in my lap. The Fertitta family should spend some money and time on the customer experience at Gordon Biersch"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love coming here on nights when Fonzie is bartending. He's so funny and upbeat. All around wonderful person! We will definitely be coming back to see him again and again!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty horrible and they weren't busy at all. The only person that was actually hustling around were the bussers. The waiter came around and took our drink order and didn't ask us if we wanted to order appetizers. After getting our drinks we didn't see our waiter for about 20 minutes. In total, we saw our waiter maybe 4 times during our dinner. Probably never coming back."}
{"text":"I was pretty pleasantly surprised by Gordon Biersch Brewery.  I'm not generally a huge fan of chains, but I was in town and a friend said it was pretty good so what the heck!  We were there at an admittedly odd time - I think it was around 4:30 on a Friday.  We're both midwesterners so while it was happy hour local time, our stomachs were quite insistent that it was time for dinner.  We ended up ordering one appetizer and one dinner to split - and it turns out we had more than enough food.  The appetizer was a Mediterranean thing - pita, hummus, tapenade and a pile of roasted garlic.  Oh, if only I didn't have to talk to people all weekend...    It was very, very good, and they offered to bring more pita bread as we still had lots of spreads but had gone through our allotment.  We also got pecan crusted chicken medallions in a creamy Marzen (one of their featured beers), which was also very, very good.  Nicely cooked and seasoned, and even though it was probably sauteed, it wasn't greasy.  I had the Czech Pilsner, my friend had the Marzen - both were quite good.  I'd definitely try both again."}
{"text":"I went to GB on Sunday to watch football with some buddies.  The happy hour is fantastic.  There are lots of things to eat and good prices on beer.  I had the slider sampler, which is a steal at $11.  You get 3 pulled pork sliders with cole slaw and 3 burger sliders with pickles and what appeared to be a mayo based sauce that had a little kick to it.  They are served with a good portion of their garlic fries, crispy and the taste of fresh garlic and herbs is heavy, which is a good thing.  I can see why the garlic fries have a solid reputation.    I'd say the food overall deserved 3 stars.  But, the comfort of the bar and the service bumps this place up to 4 stars.  Fantastic place to watch games, several TVs and if you are sitting at the bar, you can see more than 1 TV easily, so if your game is not on directly in front of you, it's not an issue.  It's a drive for me, but I'll return."}
{"text":"been exceptionally good. Friendly, prompt, helpful. Just really good service. Today only 1 other patron at bar, but bartender was more concerned with talking to servers than anything. I mean, soon as I sat down it would be nice to be acknowledged, like \"hello\", how you doing, anything. Instead after her conversation she puts s menu down. No words! Finally, she asked if I wanted a drink. She did recommend a beer after I asked a question. Someone brought my food to me, pretty good. After I had eaten 2 of the 3 sliders she did ask How are you doing so far. Not are they Good, do you like them. She wasn't busy. It's not too hard to ask a patron if they enjoy their food. After I finished and put napkin on plate, she asked if I was done and brought the bill. If she had acted the least bit lije a bartender, customer service, I would have had a couple more beers. I am a 30% tipper for good service. It's your job, pretend you care. Not this time , 10%. And she didn't deserve that. Really needs customer service training"}
{"text":"I came to see the amazing Francesca Camus & Trio perform live from 12pm-3pm on a Sunday.  I must say that the performance was absolutely fantastic, and the dance floor was electric.  Unfortunately the service was subpar and the food was very bland.  It's my first time in this restaurant and I left feeling disappointed.  If I return, it will strictly be for the live entertainment and drinks.  The food will not be consumed next time.  So sad that a huge establishment such as this turned out so underwhelming."}
{"text":"Happy hour on the weekends is an even more special treat!  And Gordon Biersch on Rampart offers just that.    * Pomegranate Mojito \"Bacardi Limon Rum, fresh pomegranate juice, fresh mint and fresh squeezed lime juice\" ($5) - Tasty drink, although not a whole lot of alcohol.  * Pint of Maibock ($3)  * Crispy Artichoke Hearts \"topped with Parmesan and lemon aioli\" ($5) - Yummy stuff, especially because you just don't see deep fried artichoke hearts everywhere.  Decent size too!  * Housemade Chips \"Fresh, housemade chips topped with bleu cheese crumbles, scallions and smoked bacon\" ($5) - The crumbles of cheese are definitely chunks and could be broken down more.  There's also a creamy something or other poured over it as well, wasn't sure what it was.  * Beer Battered Fish and Chips \"with malt vinegar and Cajun remoulade.  Served with garlic fries.\" ($6) - The happy hour size is a  half portion, which is about two pieces of fish.  The Husband enjoyed it, enough to order another one.  And you just can't help but love their fries.   We had a lot of fried food, although salads are also included in the happy hour specials.   Service was okay, it wasn't busy at all on a Sunday evening on the patio.  The waitstaff is everywhere, or so it seems because it looks like they are handling tables everywhere.  We were looking for our waiter for awhile and it could be because he just had tables inside the bar too.  Happy hours are everyday from 4 pm to 7 pm, with reverse happy hour from 9 pm to closing.  All their food is $8 and under, which includes pizzas too.  Huge selection of drinks for their happy hour with all their specialty martinis, beer, etc. included.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"What a cool place! So many beer selections (duh) and also really great food. I had the fish and chips - very fresh and delicious. The tartar sauce was good, but the side of ranch I tried lacked flavor. I thought the service was okay."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for better service and dinner.  We also enjoyed they local craft beer brewed on site.   Fun place to bring a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a brew pub and they have some pretty ok beer including a seasonal offering.  The thing I don't like about the place is that it is just so corporate sterile. It doesn't have any personal charm like say Four Peaks has.  The food is good albeit overpriced.  One of the best things is being able to sit out on the patio and people watch on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Gordon Biersch and every time I hope for a better experience. I am giving three stars only because of the slow service. Other than that the food is good, the atmosphere is fun, and their beer is good. The have a good happy hour if you can go during those times. Sign up for their rewards club and you will be sent discounts."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good!!! I got the Mediterranean pizza, but it had way too much cheese, which I could've asked for light on cheese.  Service was a little slow, but other than that it was a good place!"}
{"text":"bartenders always friendly, nice to come by here after work with all my co-workers and relax for a bit. easy-going atmosphere and hh pricing always good!"}
{"text":"After writing the original review the company contacted me and asked me to email them and discuss what I had written in the review. I sent them an email and never heard back.   That's what I call great customer service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A must go to! We had the mini brat slider and the BBQ chicken slider. They were ok. I had beer-braised Sirloin Tips. It was fantastic. It was the best meal I've had in LV. I loved every bite.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Pear salad. Hmmm. The dressing was watered down. It wasn't appealing nor did it taste that great.  The waitress was awesome. The service was great. Don't miss your chance to go to this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big chain restaurant type of person but if I am going to a chain I'd rather go here or Karl Strauss rather than an Applebee's or anything on those lines. I've been in town for the week and this place was the closest to my hotel where I could get some food and watch a World Cup game.  The place is clean, my server was nice, they had the games on and decent food. It's not easy to find a place where you can get a healthy meal and watch a sports game but this was my best option for both of those things I needed. I had the ahi tuna salad which was okay, it was really small but the sauces and dressings tasted really good.  The ahi is nothing compared to what you can get from RA sushi across the street but again I needed the game also. All of the other food around me looked really good though, the table next to me had gotten a BBQ chicken pizza which looked delicious and another table behind me had gotten burgers/sandwiches and fries so this is probably the better choice over raw fish at this type of place.  I've had a veggie burger at the San Fran location and will say that was amazing and I imagine that's on Tempe's menu also. I personally don't drink beer but I do know from others that they have a fantastic beer selection and of course they have wine as well! Overall good place if you're craving beer and burgers and don't want a dive bar or a chain."}
{"text":"Went here because it was near the hotel we were staying at. The food is pretty good. For appetizers we had the egg rolls and they were good. I had the lobster/crab cake sandwich and it was awesome I must admit. It was the real deal (no imitation here). This sandwich was a little pricey for a \"sandwich\" 16.50, however it was well worth it. Huge in size, well seasoned, and well put together. My daughter had the steak tacos and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The hubby had the spinach salad with salmon and he had no complaints. My son had the NY steak sandwich and he said it was just okay.  The service was subpar. Our waitress was forgetful and the manager ended up helping her out."}
{"text":"Went there Monday for lunch with my girlfriend. Had to have my favorite lobster tacos with sweet potato fries. Mmmmm delicious!! They keep me coming back. Lol. I wasn't sure about what beer to order n I assume he was the manager he brought me a sample of Hefewiezen which He said it was the closest to bud light n he was right. I liked it. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Even though it kills my husband that I order it, their $10 'fancy' grilled cheese sandwich is amazing.  Not crazy about the garlic fries like everyone else though... They will make you sweat garlic for a week.  Really good beers too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the years and it manages to be edible and mediocre.  We were eating there with a large party before a Coyotes game. We were out on the patio. Our server was extremely nice and very hard-working, and obviously quite overwhelmed by the number of tables she was tasked with. (Meanwhile, the other patio server kept chatting and stalling.) This meant it took a very long time to order, get food, and twenty minutes just to get our check.   My husband loved the beers--though he kept having to go straight to the bar to get drinks for him and friends. The happy hour prices are great. He ordered the Marzen BBQ burger and wasn't too happy with it, as it came out well done, not as he requested.   My son is autistic and a very picky eater. I thought he wouldn't be able to eat anything there, but a friend pointed out they do serve kettle chips even though they aren't on the menu. My son loved those chips! Very fresh and crunchy.  I had the Gorgonzola Pear salad. It was very mediocre, especially in light of the $13 price. The toppings and chicken were good, but it was served on iceberg lettuce with a lot of leaf-ribs. Come on. That's the blandest, cheapest lettuce possible. It's like adding decent toppings to water. I could buy a much, much better salad than this at 1/3 of the price at places like Panera or Wildflower. I am glad they provided me the dressing on the side, as I requested.  I ordered the strawberry soda cocktail to drink as well and I liked it. It had an initial noticeable chemical aftertaste from a sugar-free ingredient, but it was fine after that. The pieces of strawberry and the mint leaves were fresh and delicious.  In all, the dinner here reminds me of why I avoid the place with my family, and only visit if it's at a friend's request."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch (Boca Park, Summerlin)  Gordon Birsch at this location is located in the beautiful Summerlin area, in the busy and classy Boca Park Plaza, where there are many other well-known restaurants. So, parking could be difficult at times. But there is valet parking just a few yards across the front door. It is definitely worth the effort getting there to enjoy your happy hour!  Like its beautiful, huge, sister establishment near the strip, this GB has the identical, famous Happy Hours (that runs 2X a day, 3-7pm and 9pm-closing!) with great German beers and tasty dishes starting at $5, and a fantatic staff who are efficient and exceptionally friendly!  Unlike its sister establishment, GB in Summelin has a very cozy bar counter, and only a few booths and bar tables, but it does have a charming patio (- heated with torches in the winter; cooled with mists in the hot summer)! Its serving crew is incredibly friendly and smart. Most of them recognize repeat customers and could even address them by name at times - making one feel like being in that Bar in the old TV series, \"Cheers\" (-OK, so I am old and nostalgic!)  - It's a great place to unwind and watch sports over a couple drinks, especially their vast selection of tasty German style beers!  By the way, please note that their \"Seasonal Beers, which are NOT listed on the regular drinks menu, could have an usually higher alcohol content, so be sure to ask the barkeep of their alcohol contents, just in case you don't be OVERLY happy by surprise!

{"text":"Gordon Biersch Brewery at Paradise Rd  Gordon Birsch is not far from the strip. Although it is not very easy to navigate to its spacious parking lot, it'd be well worth the effort, especially for its famous Happy Hours (3-7pm, AND 9pm-Closing!) - Its Happy Hour menu has a nice selection of tasty dishes, starting at $5), and a variety of German beers, especially their special \"SEASONAL\" beers, are legendary; not to mention its selection of wines and well drinks.   - This location has an impressive brew kettle tower by the front door (much like that at the BJ, Yard House and the Chicago Brewery). Its square bar is huge and classy, as well as comfortable; there are also many bar tables and booths as well. It even has a corner space for occasional live entertainments on special occasions such tapping a new seasonal beer!  The barkeeps and the serving crew are very efficient and friendly, making customers feel comfortable and welcome.  This place seems to be always busy with happy, repeat customers, and many tourists. It is generally quite crowded and loud - a very typical HH atmosphere in a good bar/restaurant. I enjoy very much my frequent happy hours with local friends here, and having occasional dinners with out of town friends.  By the way, please note that their \"Seasonal Beers\", which are NOT listed on the regular drinks menu, could have an usually high alcohol content, so be sure to ask the barkeep of their alcohol contents, just in case you don't want to be OVERLY happy by surprise!

{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit! The server was terrific! The food was delicious. Gluten \"friendly\" and \"free\" met our group's needs for tasty food!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!  Great beers, blue crab artichoke dip and crab bites were a meal by themselves.  Great service and friendly atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to GB all over the country since they opened their doors in downtown San Jose Ca.  The food is never disappointing and the service is top notch.  I'm very thankful there's a GB in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had a burger here tonight and it was amazing. It was the burger of the week, with cracked pepper, mozzarella and blue cheese. I had it medium and it came out really juicy and melted in my mouth. I also like the seating, we were sat near the outdoor patio so it felt like we were outside but we weren't. You'll have to go there to see what i mean. I like that the seats aren't so close together and on top of each other. Our waiter, was great, prompt and polite. Din't try too hard, he was just right. I ordered a Mai Tai and it was yummy although at $9 a little pricy. My garlic fries were good too. If I ever want a burger, I will go back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent menu! Stupid gnat was harassing my husband and me the entire meal, so I knocked off a star for that. Get rid of the pests and I'll update my review. :)"}
{"text":"So me and hubby ordered some take out... Please see attached photos. Apparently a \"full sized \"wedge salad is like a tiny side one, They gave us literally 1/4 of a small lettuce head. The mahi we ordered was okay  but so dry it was inedible. The lobster mac was bland but okay! But the fries..... Why are they so salty?! And over done?! Sooooo.... Is lettuce not in season?! I'll be visiting the summerlin location that's for sure. Oh and there was a shell in my Mac and cheese :("}
{"text":"The fish tacos and apple crostata are to die for!! Every time we are at San Tan Mall this is our go to place to eat lunch or dinner. Service is friendly and fast, and the food is always amazing."}
{"text":"The BF and I came for Happy Hour and sat on the patio.   We ordered  Mojitos- The BF wasnt very heavy on the alcohol on his classic, though my pomegranate elderflower had a good amount.   Asian Trio- The eggrolls were okay, but a bit greasy. The shrimp was coated in a breading, but it wasn't crispy and they were room temperature when they got to the table. The potstickers were a weird consistency with a gumminess on the inside of the wrapper and the outside was fried yet it didn't give it any crispness...I can only tell it's fried by the bubbles created by oil on the wrapper but it wasn't left long enough to even get a golden color. It just all tasted and felt texturally like it was microwaved food. WTF?    Hawaiian mini pizza- this was just alright, but it came hot and tasted like it was cooked and not microwaved.   The service was friendly and attentive so nothing wrong with the service, but the food was just sad that it doesn't really make up for it. Kudos to our server for being really good at their job! The two stars are for them and zero for the food.   I don't know how \"off\" of a day it was or if the cooks didn't care because it's late and they just want to leave...no matter-its still the job you signed up for.  It's not digesting very well either so it's the taste that keeps on giving. Ugh.. I should've gone elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my dinner tonight. The food was fine (though my fries came out cold) but it took over an hour to get our food. Tables around us receives their food when they came much later then we did. We also mostly ordered simple things like burgers.My boyfriend also ordered one of their $2.50 beer specials and was overcharged for it. They wouldn't even give him any kind of refund for it. I've been to this location a few times and the service has always been quick but tonight they were just really off their game."}
{"text":"Good: the food, the beers, and once we were able to actually order food it came pretty quickly. Bad: the service was horrendous. The waiter barely acknowledged us the whole time we were there. One of my guests was late and she sat there for 15 minutes (by this time I was so fed up, I timed it) before our waiter finally slunk over to see if we needed anything - then tried to bolt away without taking her order until we stopped him. Then we had to basically flag him down 10 minutes later to order food.  The restaurant was completely empty - it was not in the least bit busy. As far as I could tell the waiter only had two other small tables. Super disappointed, as was my whole group, we definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a late lunch after house hunting with a friend and it was a decent sized late lunch/early dinner crowd. There wasn't a wait so that was a plus.   The food here is pretty decent. Nothing to off the wall on the menu except of how extensive the menu is. It is rather large. So it takes a bit of time to get through the entire thing.   The issue we had here was the service. Although the restaurant wasn't dead, the service was definitely lacking. Honestly there are plenty of restaurants around this area that are good, for cheaper, with better service."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the staff.  Who knew we were headed into the middle of the craziest night Glendale has seen - both a Paul McCartney concert and a WWF event at the same time.  If we had only known - dinner would have been planned for somewhere else far away! We opted for the happy hour in the bar as a couple of seats were open and were immediately greeted by a bartender who was sweet and energetic.  We were not rushed even though they were packed.  We split a chicken cashew salad which was ok, kobe sliders which were good and homemade potato chips with blue cheese, scallions and bacon which were well...finger licking good!  Great prices for the food and beverages.   Great staff."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice while in town.  It was actually a little busier both times than I would have thought.  The food was decent enough and the service and beer were both pretty good.  For the price you can get a good meal and a drink and stay away from the masses."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but my last visit wasn't so great. For starters they got rid of my favorite salad. So that threw me off I had no idea what to order on a whim I ordered fish tacos but they had barely any fish in them and were served with rice in beans I could have made at home. Won't be back for a while as I feel really ripped off. Garlic fries were tasty tho. I must admit."}
{"text":"Much happier this visit. Last time I ordered fish tacos on a whim because they had removed my favorite salad in the world. This time was different because we ordered appetizers and cheap because of happy hour. We started off with a Mojito for me and a hefeweizen for my love. Beers are a dollar off during happy hour and cocktails are all $5. I ordered the brewers combo because I love the garlic fries and the southwestern egg rolls. Babe ordered calamari and I'm not a fan of it but it wasn't as chewy as I've had it other places. We also go the brats which weren't half price but are always 7.50 on the small plate menu. Definitely a better visit from last time. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive and friendly. Most of the time this place doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"Ya'll already know....This is my spot!  I love this place!  pototoe chip nachos...Extra chees and jalapenos...Ohhh hell to the yea!   I can't believe I missed on this menu...The Hummus salad..........SayyyyyyWhat...........Lots of hummus, you can have with our without meat.  I tried it with the salmon, it was ok.  I now order it with the grilled chicken...WOW!  I love , love love this salad, and they serve it with flat bread!  Maibock is out right now, well for 1 more week!  Love that beer!"}
{"text":"Ohhh yea!  Got the Chicken Parmesan, it was awsome!  I'm not even a chicken Parm, kinda gal, lol  But this was sooooooo good, I would for sure order this again.  Also we got the Chicken wings, haven't ordered those in a while, they were sooooooooooo yummy!    Service is always awsome!  Did I ever say how much I love this place?  Happy hour is 7 days a week one from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m  And from 10:00 p.m. to Closing  The food on the Happy hr. menu starts at $5.00 for some pretty good stuff on it."}
{"text":"Went for the first time to this restaurant 2 weeks ago for Happy Hour.. actually had not planned on it but the other restaurant we were planning on eating was packed and we did not feel like waiting. Anyhow... were seated right away and tried some of their house beers. Decent, but I'm not much of a micro-brew fan. We tried a number of items off the happy hour menu and were pleased with all of them. We had the tapas, the southwest egg rolls, the bbq pork sliders and the roasted garlic & chicken pizza. The southwest egg rolls were my personal favorite and had a lot of flavor. All in all it was a nice happy hour spot and we didnt' spend a fortune to eat well."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend night, and were shocked at how much traffic there was in the shopping center. The brewery fortunately wasn't incredibly busy, and it was nice out, so they let us seat ourselves outside near the bar. It was empty before that and so they turned the heat lamps on for us. We couldn't find a server so we went in to find one. She was very nice and informative. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger special, but it had very little flavor, and the mashed potatoes tasted instant. I also tried a bite of the gorgonzola butter steak, and it was pretty flavorless and ended up making my friend ill. Beer was better than the food, for sure, so I would recommend checking it out mainly for the bar."}
{"text":"We went to this place twice while in town for a week. The first time we went for lunch. When we went for lunch it was not very busy. However, the food was good and the service was good. The menu was diverse and it seemed like a good array of all foods. In regards to the house brewed beers, the golden ale and the amber ale were the best in my opinion. We went back at night to watch a sports game and sit at the bar. The bar service was good. Overall I had a good experience, no complaints."}
{"text":"I really like this chain, great beers  ( including seasonal selections) and very good food.  I think the prices are a little bit high, but the quality is good.  Happy hour has reverted to a simpler offering, and that's good,as they got overwhelming for a while.  Great patio w/ a fireplace when  the weather allows.  Service is always friendly, and happy hour goes until 6:30 and all day long on Sunday."}
{"text":"What's the excitement about this place. We went for lunch recently and the food was some of the most unexciting stuff I have had in a while. Compound that with poor service and we won't be back. Honestly, I can make a bad chicken sandwich at home."}
{"text":"From now on, no matter how good other things look on the menu, I will only get a beer and fried artichoke hearts... and maybe a wedge salad. I have been disappointed the last two times I've been there. The calamari was so bland that we sent it back after one bite. The new Caribbean appetizer platter was gross - the mahi mahi was so over-fried you couldn't' tell what it was, the \"Kobe\" burgers were over cooked, and the sauce for the ahi spring rolls was basically orange mayo. SO, lesson learned - stick to the things we know....artichoke hearts and beer!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible - fish was dry and brussel sprouts were soggy. And the prices were outrageous. I paid $30 for the smallest slice of overcooked fish and ten Brussel sprouts. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Great brews and the southwest egg rolls ROCK"}
{"text":"I used to live in Palo Alto, home of the original Gordon Biersch, in the early 1990s, so my immediate association with Gordon Biersch was \"obnoxious yuppies.\" But hey, I was in grad school then.   The Las Vegas Gordon Biersch is really popular, so if you are going with a group, call ahead, or make a reservation, if they will let you. We were a party of 10 but they don't have a 10-top so were split between two tables outdoors. That said, their outdoor seating is nice and there was only one person smoking nearby (I am always surprised at people smoking in restaurants since I live in a smoke-free city).  I ordered the Heffeweisen, which was truly delicious and tasted like peaches. Very smooth going down. The mushroom and swiss burger was perfectly cooked to order and insanely delicious even without a bun. Even with cole slaw substituted for fries, the burger made a very filling meal. Other people at the table ordered ahi tacos and fish and chips, and seemed to be enjoying their food. The noise level was acceptable outside, so it seemed like a good place to come with a bunch of friends and be able to have a conversation."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant at least 10 times in the past, and have never had an issue. I like to take out of town guests there. I will never go back after last nights dinner.  Our servers name was Josh, and he was terrible. We waited over 15 minutes before he initially approached our table, waited another 15 minutes for our drinks, never even got water! Food was cold when it finally arrived. We actually had to flag a bus boy over to take away our empty appetizer dishes to make room for entree plates. Waited even longer to get our check. I didn't want to embarrass anyone by complaining to the manager, but I'm calling today to say something about the horrible service we received. This used to be a decent restaurant, never going back and I recommend no one go there."}
{"text":"We decided to hop the rail and go into the heart of the Mill party district for a brew. It was still early and the young crowd was still at home getting their drink on so the street traffic was light.  Started out here with the Märzen. Poured into a pint glass it has a bright copper color.  I can smell the caramel with faint hops. An easy drinking draft, I could probably bang down several of these pretty quick.  Nice brew house and the gals are cool."}
{"text":"First of all during happy hour just trying to get a drink 16 minutes for Jack on the rocks all the bartenders standing there talking with wine glasses in his hand chit-chatting.. server says he's really busy I said I've heard that if you put the wine glasses down to stop flirting with the customers that you can pour drinks.. then I Jack on the Rocks is 10.50 during happy hour it's quite a bargain... Now I'm drinking Jack Daniels in almost every state in this beautiful Union and a multiple countries and I've never paid 10.50 ever ! people this is Gilbert I understand it's where the people that can't afford to Scottsdale but wish it was Scottsdale move to but give me a break."}
{"text":"Loving the National Cheeseburger Day deal with a beer! Beer is good (blonde) and the southwest egg rolls were spicy and warm!   As usual, the service is great. Everyone is super nice. The manager brought out our apps and checked in with us.   Happy hour specials are pretty good."}
{"text":"Okay, okay.      I had to update because I had an amazing burger here.  The Surf and Turf. I love seafood, and this burger has a nice thick beef patty with lobster meat, on. Top. Of. It.  I've had it twice now, and I love it. I love seafood in general, and this burger hits the spot when I'm craving a good one.  We also had calmari, and stuffed shrimp.  The calamari is good, I just wish it was a little more crispy. The wasabi sauce they give you with it is really good.  The stuff shrimp was good, but not my favorite.   Anyways, if you're looking for a new good burger, try the Surf and Turf."}
{"text":"I am torn with the rating.  3.5 is about right, but I was on the patio and it was  a beautiful day, so round up.  I had the IPA - a very decent choice and then the Tina small plate and vegetable salad small plate.  Both were excellent.  I would order both again in a heartbeat.  This location is not overly busy.  I really like it"}
{"text":"Efficient and well-run, they seemed to handle the Friday night crowd on a busy weekend very well. Our group of six sat on the balcony, enjoyed our beers, munched on garlic fries, and then had a nice dinner. As the sunset, we shared a couple bread puddings. Good food and service."}
{"text":"Walking in, I hadn't realized it was a chain, but it was a good place to relax a bit and grab a bite to eat.    I was feeling a bit under the weather, not up for a beer at the time, so I didn't sample any of their German style brews.    I did sample the house chips, which come topped like a loaded baked potato.  They weren't too shabby.    I also had the seared ahi salad.  It was good.  The greens were fresh and the tuna was perfect.  I also ordered a side of the sweet ginger rice.  (I can't pass up anything laced with ginger.)  It was also pretty good.  They serve dessert shooters which are great when you just want a couple of bites of something sweet.  It was a nice finale."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location, I usually go to the paradise location, it's closer for me. But we just got out of a concert at Red Rock Resort, and wanted a quick bite to eat.   Happy hour at Gordon Biersch! Score!   I love their happy hour menu. So many choices from $5 martinis and mixed drinks to $11 combos of sliders, garlic fries, and other goodies.   My friend and I shared one of their $11 combos. We got the one with 3 Kobe sliders, shredded BBQ pork sliders, and garlic fries.  I have to agree their garlic fries are delicious- onoliscious!!! I'm picky about my fries, and these were soft yet a bit crispy, garlic and parsley? that stuck to the fries. I hate it when the flavoring is dry and sticks to the bottom of the basket rather than the fries.   The sliders were good, not the best I've had but they were pretty good.   For us, we can usually eat a lot but we got full off of sharing this combo.   We got lucky, cuz as soon as we sat down a guy that was leaving gave us his $5 off coupon. Score again!   But even without the coupon the happy hr prices are really good.   The service here was just okay, not rude but we had to wait longer than we should have for the check."}
{"text":"The beer is good, the food not so great.  My pasta was very bland and overpriced. I would ONLY go back for beer, French fries, and dessert."}
{"text":"Dinner was fine for the most part. We asked to have a chicken breast put back onto the grill because we wanted it well done. And then we got to watch the Line Cook make faces at the server when asked to put it back on the grill for a minute. He didn't realize we were right in front of him. Unfortunate for both of us."}
{"text":"I initially went to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe and was not impressed as their beers were flavorless.  However, my wife and I live within walking distance of this Gordon Biersch and a few months ago went there for a snack and a drink.  I can't recall what I had (it was a seasonal), but it actually tasted like a decent beer.  So, my opinion was beginning to change.  until a few weeks ago.  My wife and I are from Indianapolis and we wanted to go somewhere to watch the Colts vs. Bills game.  We walked to GB, arriving at 11:30 a.m. (the game started at 11).  There were a total of 6 people in the restaurant taking up 2 separate tables, 1 inside and 1 outside.  None of the 6 people were remotely interested in any of the football games showing on the various tvs.  My wife and I sat at the outside bar and asked the bartender if she could switch a tv to the Colts game as it was not on any of the tvs.  She said someone had called in and requested the game showing on that tv.  (I think it was Cincy).  I asked if they could change a different tv, or put the Cincy game on another tv.  I also remarked that no-one was here, it was 11:30 and my wife and I were there and ready to spend money.  She said she had to ask the Manager.  The bartender returned - yes bartender - not the manager - and said, \"the manager said we cannot change the channels since someone called in and requested the games.\"  I laughed and said, \"well we are here, ready to spend money.\"  Keep in mind, there were multiple tvs - in the remote chance the Cincy fans arrived and wanted that game on that particulary tv, there were other tvs that were not being watched that could have accomodated us or the Cincy fans.  Again - only 6 people in the entire restaurant with multiple tvs - just none of them showing the Colts.  (and the hapless Cards were not playing until later in the day, at home)    The bartender was very professional, and annoyed at the manager's decision, but said there was nothing she could do.  So we left.  I thought it was poor management that the manager refused to change the channel and also did not have the courage to come tell us.  Interesting note, we called BJ's and asked if they had the Colts game on.  They said \"no, but we will put it on any channel you want.\"  Guess who we gave our business to?  I think we spent about $50, not counting tip."}
{"text":"The only thing cool about GB in Tempe is the old building it resides in. It has character and distinction in a sea of cookie cutter architecture. The food is decent and the beer is ok. I have been to 4 different GBs , 3 in Northern Cali and 1 in AZ, and they are equally mediocre  in quality. I guess chains really take the coolness out of places. I watched this show last night on McDonald's, as it highlighted the top 10 Mikey D's in the world, based on uniqueness. It ranged from Times Squares 4 story MD with a Broadway Marquee of lights facing 42nd street, to an MD designed like a huge Happy Meal in Dallas Texas.  The chain rule applies to GB and MD, cool exterior doesn't change the fact you still serve processed chain food.   Anyway, the highlight of my GB experience was when I went accidentally to the actual brewery in San Jose. I Google Map GB in the attempts to find one close to my hotel, low and behold, I showed up and it was the freakin' brewery! It smelled great, like roasted hops and barely, but it was closed so I couldn't get in. I all of  sudden felt like singing the Lavern and Shirley Theme Song as I walked in the parking lot looking for an open door.........Schlemiel, schlimazel, hasenpfeffer incorporated! I too felt like I worked at a brewery, just for one shining moment."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour last weekend. I already knew I liked the Mahi sandwich, but they made me believers in a few other items. I ordered the 18oz ribeye. I almost never gamble on a chain steak or a brewpub steak, but I was in the mood for steak and the wife ordered the Mahi sandwich. It wasn't cooked perfectly to medium-rare and it was a little grizzly, but for $22 or $23, it was definitely worth what I paid. The $5 martini deal at happy hour is fantastic. Grey Goose and a decent pour."}
{"text":"Overall food menu is average. I settled for the chicken sandwich, which was fine but just couldn't seem to find anything else on the menu that interested me. Main reason you would probably go anyways would be the beer and they seem to knock that out of the park. Very cool patio seating and enjoyed the ambiance. Would say it's a great place to grab a beer and appetizer, not a huge fan of the food."}
{"text":"Not very patron friendly. About 20 local business owners met for happy hour on a Tuesday evening. We were in section of the bar area networking and socializing.  We had asked a local realtor about current market conditions so she stood in front of the 5-6 tables we occupied and started talking. The manager came over and rudely interrupted her  telling her she could not speak to our small group in that manner.  We were no louder than any other table in the place. We stayed a little while longer then went next door to the Kona Grill for a nice dinner. We weren't about to spend any more money than we already had in that unfriendly establishment."}
{"text":"Pros : clean place Cons: lots. The service was horrible, especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks. Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24. And when you get bad service for spending so much, that would drive me crazy.   Drinks and food were ok. Not the quality I expected. There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far better.  In short, I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives."}
{"text":"I put GB as a solid 4 stars when being compared to other breweries and pub-like food. Solid beers, very good burgers and the German sausage player was exceptional (the wife is Czech and gave big props). 3 stars doesn't seem fair in my book.  Nice place... Give it a shot"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chain restaurants. I always return for good quality quick bites and good beer.  My latest visit was on the way to a show on the strip. Quick friendly service. We had three appetizers and a couple of red ales. Beer, great! no over hop flavor that so many micro brews have. Beef tenderloin sliders were terrific. Good caramelized onions, soft buns, perfectly cooked meat. Bratwurst sliders also very good. Next time I'll skip the Parmesan chips. Too subtle on the cheese flavor for me.    A good small meal in a very inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had drinks with a friend the other night. The staff was super friendly. The bar area was pretty quite (the main dining room was closed when we were there). However, the bar did offer a limited late night dining menu and great happy hour drink specials. If you like mixed drinks, all the specialty cocktails are $5.00 11 to close. I tried a couple and they were all very delish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday night at 930, sat in the bar. Finally flagged down a server who told us she was done with her shift but would let someone know we were there. Finally a guy came over and took our drink order but never came back. We sat for 20 min and then decided to leave. Horrible service especially for sitting right in the bar!!"}
{"text":"I'm going with a 3 star although I would say one of the dishes we had could have been executed a little better..but if I could rate it just on service it would be a solid 4 star. once again I'm going to stray away from giving food dishes their particular review because it didn't really wow us.  when you eat at a bar that serves food you hope that they put out some excellent stuff for the price and being that this spot was in boca park right next to cheesecake factory you would think they are a decent restaurant. for the price I would say no but if you have a gift card then it's worth it. I'll probably be back just based on service alone because the staff is real cool. one thing I really enjoyed that was pretty good was the burger and the garlic fries! yum my wife loves the beer too"}
{"text":"One of the girls we were with had a vodka on the rocks (or vodka soda? anyway....) and was about half done with it.  She set it on the empty table next to us because we ran out of room on ours, and the staff must have accidentally taken it while bussing the plates, etc.  Our friends flags down the server (Lydia?) and explains the situation.  She comes back with a half-full drink to replace the one that was taken.  We thought this was a bit odd, we figured she would bring us a 'full' drink, since it was taken from us in error.  The server gets the manager (Julie?) who was adamant about not replacing it with a whole drink, because the drink that was taken was only half full.  Are we really arguing about this?!?  She finally says 'Fine, I'll just get you another drink' with a noticeable undertone of attitude.  And we ended up getting charged for both drinks.  Come on.....  This could have been handled much better from the get-go; I feel the manager cared more about saving the dollar in liquor cost than just taking care of the issue.  Won't be going back, which is a shame.  The beer and sausage sliders were yummy though!"}
{"text":"This was a very busy night with tomorrow being Valentines Day. We chose to sit in the bar area and had Georgia as our waitress.  She was super busy but maintained friendly and good humored customer service. The food was excellent. We had chicken wings for appetizers and they wee perfect. Not too salty and plenty of meat on them.  I got the Chicken Schnitzel and my husband got the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Both dishes were tasty and worth trying. We will certainly continue to eat here as long as the service and food are excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here last time i was out in AZ and booth their food and beer selection was awesome! It's located in the heart of Mill street so if you're doing some walking around town stop by here! You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Located on the \"party street\" of Tempe, AZ... Mill street has character and you can view it all and the people from the bar area of this spot.  Second floor, great window seating if its not too packed. The only Gordon Biersch I have attended was located in Taipei, Taiwan. The IPA there was AMAZING and the wine here was FANCY. My girl and I wanted some drinks before our sushi extravaganza and we were torn apart between a beer sampler or something bubbly. Great Seasonal Ale's were also available. And we had a sample of them before we made our final choice.  We held our pinky's up and went all out on some whites. She got the moscato and I got chardonnay. No REGRETS ;) Staff was friendly, seating was good and the crowd was chill for a Sunday evening. They had games playing on the TVS and food was being served ~ very casual, dinner date approved."}
{"text":"I was here in Vegas with two of my buddies from LA and convinced them to try out Gordon Biersch. It's right off flamingo Dr make a left on Paradise Rd. In a business plaza just 1 mile from the strip. Thank you to our server Pocket and the manager TJ on a awesome experience. Had the blue crab and artichoke dip amazing, garlic fries always on point. The brew: Marzen smooth and full of flavor my fave, my friend had their Hefenweizen he said it was awesome, next level kinda stuff :) Fully stocked bar, meant we had a round of Don Julio to top it off. Yeah baby, come and try this spot on Sunday, Live Music, fully stock bar, and sports. A can't miss!"}
{"text":"I went with large group for a holiday gathering. We were asked to pre-select our entree from a set menu.  I understand that getting hot food out to thirty people can be a real challenge. Our server(s) did an outstanding job of that as well as making sure that everyone's drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, were always refilled.  About the food: I had the steak medallions - three good sized pieces of peppery sirloin steak served with mashed potatoes and vegetables - it was just OK. The steak was tender enough but there was nothing special about it. The mashed potatoes were dry and the veggies were, well, they were veggies.  They served some appetizers beforehand. Some sort of spicy chicken eggroll thingy that was pretty good. Dessert was apple bread pudding that was so-so. They brew their own beer but I was dismayed to learn that they don't offer an IPA. I had a Czech Pilsner that was just OK.  Overall the food and beer experience was decidedly middle of the road. I like the ambiance of the place. It's kind of an upscale bar and grill atmosphere with menu options galore. I will have to go back either for happy hour or to try something from the regular menu."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. I have had better food at Grease pits. To man employees standing around doing nothing. And some joking about getting others fired."}
{"text":"this place has the best lemonades!!  strawberry, raspberry... the best!"}
{"text":"We were here with a large party.  Great service and GREAT tasting food. We had a limited menu & I got the salmon. I asked for it seared rare. Soooo tasty!! I didn't have beer but heard that it was good. We sat in a side area all together (around 30) and had 2 TVs and watched the game. Good time & would love to go back!"}
{"text":"David, who walked us to our table when we first arrived (0 wait, by the way) was AMAZING! Talk about great customer service, he held a friendly conversation with us until we sat down at our booth. The food was ok, 6 out of 7.. the meal my mother in law wanted to order was not available, so she went with a sub par appetizer instead. Portions were not too small but not too big either. Service time was just right, our waitress was friendly and kept stopping by to make sure we were doing okay. When we left, David held the door open for my husband who was carrying my sleeping daughter and told us to have an amazing night. He is the reason this review went up one more star than it would have been."}
{"text":"The salad was near inedible. Not a great place to ear. There are far better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has the nicest and most engaging bartenders I have had in quite some time. Absolutely friendly and welcoming.   I sat down to watch the Suns beat the Grizz last night and was relatively by myself at the bar. My iPhone was dead so the usual texting and internet surfing to keep myself busy wasn't available. The girl bartender was pretty talkative and the guy behind the bar while kind of a douche was fairly interested in the game and asking me a lot of questions. It's not normal to go somewhere in Tempe and have a bartender do anything but ignore you.  I ordered a Southwest Chicken Sandwich and about 5 minutes later the wrong order came out. She apologized and re-ordered the correct one and I watched her type rush in on the order. Well 33 minutes later (I read what time the ticket order was placed) my sandwich finally came. The other patrons around me were cracking jokes about me starving and such, the bartenders comped a couple beers, and I was pretty good spirited about it. When it finally came, I don't know if it was because of the built up anticipation or what, but that wasn't a very good $10 sandwich. A shitty processed chicken patty, red peppers, and some mayo don't exactly scream that a lot of thought went into it.   My experience was so mixed that I really had to break it down to four categories. The service was top notch 5 stars, the food was a total let down and I'll give it 2 because it was still edible :) Kitchen service is shit 1 star, and the atmosphere is one of the best for watching the game, so 4 for that. overall 3 stars is fair."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is perhaps the most extensive and worthwhile in the city with a wide far from fancy fried artichoke hearts to sweet chile glazed chicken wings.  $3 a pint is also great and I must say I was a big fan of the Marzen."}
{"text":"Went in today for a quick lunch we had a 10 dollar off coupon in my e mail and showed our waitress it about 15 minutes later im video chatting with my mom clearly busy and here comes the rude ass manager by the name of nick he stands at our table and interrupts my conversation asking to see the coupon so i told him okay give me a second and je continues to stand at our table! I had to hang up my mother just to show him this coupon!!! Then he tried walking away with my phone so i held on to it while HE was holding MY PHONE!! We wont be back weve only been there twice but today was our last time! On a side note our waitress MALANEA was extremly sweet and gave us good service thank you again"}
{"text":"Went during happy hour. The drinks were amazing.. Pomegranate mojito!!! The food was good, and the waitress was on top of things and friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband got a coupon for a buy one get one free entree with the purchase of 2 drinks, so we popped in on Friday evening just in time for Happy Hour.  Happy hour prices are ridiculously awesome, and with buy one get one entrees, we were pretty damned happy!  Happy hour specials: We ordered a $3 21 oz tangelo hefe beer, which was delightful, and a $6 mai tai that was DELICIOUS.   We also ordered a $9 blue crab and artichoke appetizer that was so good I burned the roof of my mouth because I couldn't wait for it to cool down a little.  My one criticism would be that there wasn't enough bread/chips.  Not to worry though, I ate the remaining dip with a spoon, it was that good.  For our entrees, we decided on the Cesar salad with grilled salmon for me, and the seafood Cobb salad for my love, we ordered both with the dressing on the side.  My Cesar was awesome.  The salmon was absolute perfection, and the rest of the salad was as expected:  the dressing was good, and they gave me enough without it being overdressed.    The seafood Cobb was great.  The chef forgot the egg, but our server was super sweet and brought it over right away after we asked.  We took the avocado off for my allergy, but the rest of it was really nice.    Service was polite and friendly, if not overly fast, but it was pretty busy, and we didn't mind.   I definitely plan to go back for more happy hour specials!!"}
{"text":"Just keep driving.    This location is not like any other location I have visited.  Before i start with the food, let's talk about the horrible service. We waited an hour for our food for a party of 5. The issue wasn't our party size because 3 tables that walked in after just as equal in size received there food before we did. The waitress wouldn't even come over to address the wait time.  We had to ask numerous times for water and soda refills.   I wanted the CBLT with a turkey patty instead of the chicken breast. Apparently this was the hardest dish in the world for the kitchen because that is not what I received. They sent me the regular turkey burger. My colleague ordered the Seafood Cobb and received Shrimp Tacos.  I  had to remove the bottom of my sandwhich bun because it was hard as a rock.  The manager gave a 40% discount after he informed me he didn't even understand my order. Really? How hard is it to switch a chicken breast out for a turkey patty?   Seriously, do yourself a favor and just keep driving."}
{"text":"Food was good. I love that they have a vegetarian menu... I had the mushroom Philly it was really good... My friend had the French toast w/ eggs and bacon pretty good -- -great food and great service - - prices not that bad either"}
{"text":"Gordon, you and I go back a while. It's time we had a talk.  For years we were beautiful together. I enjoyed so many tall glasses of the Martzen, so many baskets of the garlic fries, so much time looking admiringly on your servants dressed up in those creepily evocative brown shirts. Thanks to my Bay Area connections I spent more than a few nights in your care in your San Jose location: The original joint! Hell, on one occasion I was actually mistaken for one of your founders by another regular.  So it makes me wonder what's happening in Tempe. It looks like the whole place hasn't had maintenance in a while. The beer is still good. I've decided to restrain myself from the fries, but they still smell great. But it's as if the whole building is wearing a sad face.  I know that the assh  . . . I mean City Fathers . . . yeah, that's it. . .  of Tempe raised rents on everyone on Mill, hoping to turn Tempe into another Manhattan. We can tell how that worked by how many boarded-up storefronts there are. Everyone else has bugged out to the Riverfront or whatever that is over on the other side of Rural. You are standing firm, and that's to be admired. But see, the longer you stay the more I kinda avoid that location. I'm afraid the fail wave is washing up against your shores as well.  So I would do what needs to be done to dress the place up a bit, or make plans to move. Don't miss the tide."}
{"text":"Dinner was ok, but not amazing. I didn't like how the waiter greeted us by tossing the cardboard coasters across the table. One of our four dinners came out much later than the others."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Memorial Day.   Really enjoyed the great service, Turkey Ciabatta and excellent garlic fries.  I had heard about these fries long ago.  Apparently these used to be served at Chase Field (where D-backs play).  My bacon could have been much crispier but otherwise I had no complaints."}
{"text":"I like this one so much more than the one by the Hard Rock. It's more of a neighbor hood place but can get pretty busy later on the weekends. I love the fish & chips here. I think that's the only thing I ever get here. The place is clean, The people are nice and it's decorated with alot of cultured stones and cool architecture."}
{"text":"This was a terrible meal on a Saturday afternoon! The restaurant wasn't very crowded so there was no rush on the part of the cook or waitress! First impression was that our waitress hated her job! She wasn't friendly or didn't have a smile when she came to our table. I felt like she didn't want to be there. I ordered Grilled Redfish and what I received was a dried filet of fish that was total salt! My kale salad was the opposite! No flavor at all to it. The best part was the vegetables! For a price of over $15.00 I would have expected something tasty. The waitress NEVER asked me about my meal and since I didn't eat it I think she should have said, was everything ok??  My husband asked me not to complain as he just wanted to leave an not make a scene. I was not happy at all.  In fact, I probably not go back again."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is just okay, not outstanding, not bad. It's a typical chain restaurant on a larger scale.  My husband and I were out looking at new cars and this place was literally right next door to the dealership. After spending two hours test driving and trying to figure out what he wanted he was hungry and we didn't want to go home and cook.  Not being a chain restaurant fan I knew how this was going to turn out. The decor would be nice, the food would be average and the bill would be above average for what we ordered. And I was right.  It's not that I didn't like it, it just wasn't anything special. My partner ordered meatloaf with vegetables (low carb) and I must say the broccoli was huge and cooked to perfection, nice and crunchy. The meatloaf was grilled and included sausage as one of the meats. While I love crunchy broccoli and the meatloaf was okay (he let me sample both) he doesn't like either that way.   I on the other hand went with a Ceasar Salad with Salmon. The Salmon was fresh and overall it tasted good. Luckily I wasn't hungry because it wasn't a lot of food.   All in all Gordon Biersch was what I expected. It could probably rate as high as four stars, but it is a chain restaurant after all."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is just your typical beer pub.  I came here  to  join my co-workers for a small happy hour celebration.   The pub was very nice and spacious. This pub/ restaurant  can accommodate  children as well.  However,  the food and drinks are absolutely  over priced and blan.  While their I had the Fish Taco's and their fries.  I had more tortilla  than fish  for all three tacos.   The taco  was dry and  hard.  On regards  to the fries, they were greasy and lacked flavor as well.  Overall,  this place is nice to have a small  drink, but mainly  just to hang out."}
{"text":"A group of us met up at the Gordon Biersch on Paradise. The decor looks like a BJ's but is  nicer. I am a big fan of the Garlic Fries and the first thing I ordered as an Appetizer was Garlic fries and they are just as good as I get in Sacramento. I was going to order the Blonde Bock since that is the best that Gordon Biersch has and was told that it was removed from the menu. I was upset so I ordered their Heff. I normally don't like it but at the restaurant it was very good. Must be something that the bottle and shipping does to it. I then ordered the Salmon with Garlic Dill sauce and substituted for more Garlic Fries.  (YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD) The salmon was about 25.00 and is pricy but it was tender and good flavored. I was going to order another beer but was driving that night and didn't want to get a buzz going.  I wish that there is one in Sacramento but I would suggest having them even though my total bill came to about 45.00 but that was because of the 18% tip because of being a large party. I highly recommend when you want good food and good drink and with friends."}
{"text":"First off, this to me is Scottsdale, north Scottsdale, in a primo location across from the Harkins 101 and so many stores.  3 of us went for lunch.  Sat outside at the bar (that has indoor seating as well).  Really really nice.  The tacos, fish and chips and seafood stew were outstanding.  The beer was great too.  Thanks.  Love going here."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Gordon Biersch across different states and locations.  The one thing that stands out to be is the service for all locations.  Its good service, very accommodating.  Its a kinda place you can go with a baby and still relax but get a higher quality service, food, atmosphere and of course beer.    This location made my day, when I saw that it was directly outside my hotel.   They did not let me down.  Brought me a sample of a new beer right as I sat down without me asking.  Love that."}
{"text":"Beer and food are great.  Patio by fire place seating is disgusting.  Hair on the table old food dried on and wicker furniture in disrepair.  Talked to the manager and said it was a cap issue.  No  excuse for the gross patio that needs a good power wash.  Hope the kitchen is cleaner than the patio."}
{"text":"Omg their steak is amazing!! Love their sample flights too. They're literally the prefect pairing for their blue cheese crusts steak. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Let first say I like Gordon Biersch but they could use a little work. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming when I entered the restaurant. I went there last Thursday night for drinks and appetizers with a friend. We split the Brewer's Feast* American-style Kobe Beef Sliders, Garlic Fries, Southwest Egg Rolls and Hummus with garlic crostini for 17.95. I would be willing to bet my pay check that was not Kobe beef on the sliders. It was dry ordinary beef with no flavor. I've read past reviews on Gordon's and many people rave about the garlic fries, they were just ok, actually a little soggy. The southwest egg rolls were good they're always a favorite of mine. The hummus was a total flop, lacked flavor. I ordered a couple of beers, I had their seasonal winter brew which had good flavor and a golden. The beer is always good and I love ambience of Gordon's. The bartender could've been a little more attentive considering it was a slow rainy Thursday night. One suggestion is Gordon's could lower their prices, its a bit on the steep side. All things considered I would return Gordon's because I love the location and 1 of the few brewery's nearby."}
{"text":"What a nice place to spend your birthday. Lauren was very accommodating and it was a pleasure to meet Ernesto, the manager. Appreciated that he came over to our table to wish my husband and I happy birthday. We both have April birthdays."}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times...First time a year ago was great...times after that, not so much...this refers to service, value, and the food and drink..  We just went again this past Sunday.  Danny was our server...Service was out of this world...seriously fun and good.    Danny even helped me decide as I was having difficulty choosing.  I had the bruschetta chicken, and it was delish..  Everything was wonderful about this visit..Danny asked us our names, and used our names when telling us to have a nice day and to come back soon.  Oh, and there passport program is really good..annnndddd...today, I received an email for a free dinner as my birthday is tomorrow.  Gotta love this place...See you soon Danny..."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. We sat here for two hours without ever having a server. The manager was kind and tried to be helpful. I would not recommend this location to anybody."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I have no complaints on service. It feels a bit overpriced in some things and as a college student that leaves me at a 4 with this place. The interior if beautiful and makes you really feel like you've been transported to somewhere else. Great date spot but not an everyday place. Try the lobster Mac n cheese! Wow!"}
{"text":"There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, including room at the bar and more traditional restaurant style towards the back of the restaurant. Our greeter and waitress were very friendly. No criticism about the service.  My only \"complaint\" is the food. I will start off by saying that their garlic spinach ($2.75) is SO GOOD. I'm definitely ordering that next time. However, I would not recommend their Seafood Cobb Salad ($14.25). I know... what am I doing ordering a salad at Gordon Biersch? I was really craving a salad, and the restaurant was not my choice. The dinky shrimp in the salad was soggy, and the bacon tasted artificial. The salad overall just did not taste fresh. My friend said it was better before, but I guess I should have known better than to order a salad here.  At any rate, I plan to visit Gordon Biersch again and hope to revise my review after trying something different, but I was just not convinced of their quality if they can't master the basics!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Rude waitress. Cold, tasteless food. Multiple people sitting around us sent food back."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently after attending an event for one reason - they were the only place open at 9:30 PM in this relatively deserted area of North Scottsdale.  There were a handful of customers at the bar and more servers on duty than necessary.  Our server appeared to have only one section, the one we were seated in.  Having never been to Gordon Biersch I was unaware how large of a chain they are.  We try to avoid chain restaurants, and Gordon Biersch is a good example of why.  It is painfully mediocre.  The decor is the same as you would see in any chain bar, the menu items are uninspired, the wait staff are drones and, unfortunately, unless you are into a tiny variety of beers of their choice, there is a rather limited bar menu.  Beer is such a subjective thing I won't rate it here, other than to say most of their beers are not to my choice.  Some of the breweries like Gordon Biersch mess around so much with trying to create trendy craft beers they lose sight of what beer should taste like.  The mixed drinks here are terrible and overpriced at $9.  On a scale of 1 - 10 our server would rate an 8 as a standup comic and a 0 as a waiter.  He couldn't remember what anyone ordered, and our orders were not that complicated.  The guy is definitely in the wrong business.  I won't go into any more detail, it really isn't worth it.  I fail to understand why people pay top dollar to support bland chain restaurants when there are so many unique local places that are so much better."}
{"text":"The newest Gordon Biersch brewery. It's in Summerlin, which is an affluent suburb of Las Vegas (15-20 minutes from the Strip). This Gordon Biersch is pretty much exactly like every other Gordon Biersch, so I'm not gonna go into details. However, this is pretty darn cool for one reason - the patio. It's Vegas...it's 95 degrees at night....and you get to sit on an awesome patio, under some trees, look at palm trees and mountains in the distance, and have an ice cold beer. Really, I don't pretend to ask for anything more than that. As it's a really nice alternative to the gigantic Cheesecake Factory next door!"}
{"text":"They have good house beers, their egg rolls are awesome when dipped in their house jalapeño ranch. The Hawaiian pizza was all hand made and the crust soft and chewy like fried dough would taste; one of my favorite crusts however the pizza sauce flavor was a bit bland. The ham on the pizza were large chunks but almost too big for a pizza. I ended up eating them on the side.  Overall the place has great atmosphere and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night at the tail end of happy hour. We sat in the bar area. The restaurant and bar area were fairly full, but we were seated with no wait. I ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos with sweet potato fries. Everything was fresh and delicious! My husband had the lobster mac 'n' cheese. He said it was good....better than he remembered when he ordered it previously.  The service in the bar area was exceptional. Beers and food came our quickly, and the server even brought 2 samplers for my beer enthusiast husband. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for cold draft and their bratwurst sliders, very tasty sausage with a grainy mustard. I had the Apple cider slaw which was good but I prefer sweeter but everything was fresh and the staff seems to like working there and are on the ball. I live a half a mile away and happy to have a draft beer and not have gaming machines on the bar."}
{"text":"Tried a few items and a flight of all of their craft brews.  Service was great as well as the food.  The manager came over and chatted us up and offered up a sample of their Octoberfest, which was really good as well.  I will definitely come back.  Try the baby brats"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch was exactly what we were in the mood for on our last eve in Vegas and an early morning flight. It was close to our hotel, but not right on the strip. We ordered a beer sampler and appetizer combo with southwest chicken rolls, hummus, Kobe beef sliders, and garlic fries to start. I especially like the chicken rolls, but disliked their hummus. My husband ordered pasta jambalaya, which was served mixed with orzo pasta. The jambalaya portion was very generous and my husband did enjoy it. I ordered mediterranean chicken, which was listed under the lower calorie entrees. The veggie sauté was excellent and the chicken breast was decent for not being Smothered in something calorie laden. We would eat there again for sure. They had a huge menu and lots of salads to choose from, too."}
{"text":"I was in town with a couple of buddies for the Dodger's spring Training. This was the only restaurant we recognized back from Cali so we stopped by.   1.house brewed  Hef 2.Hummus and Goat Cheese Salad 3.Pulled pork.  Enough said :)  Before we drove back to Cali we had to stop again for take out ..and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. yum."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona on a business trip and checked out this brewery. So glad I came! I don't remember what beer I got but it was the first one on the menu and it started with \"golden\" it was not bitter \"which I hate\" and was really refreshing. The food was fantastic! I got a chicken sandwich and fries. The environment was laid back and everyone was having a good time. I hope to come back some day! Cheers"}
{"text":"We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Close to the airport, they can get pretty busy and servers can get flighty. The times I've been here, I've never missed a flight so it's not that bad.  Garlic fries are fantastic! You can skip everything else on the menu but not the garlic fries. They use fresh garlic...dragon breath! After they took my go-to dish off the menu (blackened Mahi sandwich), I felt so lost and unable to choose what's good here. Then, they put it back on the menu...talk about playing with my emotions! Their hummus and calamari are quite good.  Beer-wise, I like their Hefeweizen (fruity, sweet wheat beer) and Blonde Bock (heavy, creamy and filling). You'll end up wanting more garlic fries.  This place is more like 3.5. 5 stars for the garlic fries, 3 stars for the service and 2.5 stars for the entire menu and value."}
{"text":"Went for afternoon drink and snacks with 5 folks.  Sat outside (pleasant even in 85 degree heat).   Great microbrew selection - tried the selection of appetizers - Tapas (garlic, olive tappenaude, tomatoes and hummus), Grilled Asparagas, Kobe Slides and Garlic Fries.   Food was ok, hummus a bit dry, asparagus nothing to write home about.  Waitress was friendly and helpful - she brought out a sample of Heffenweisen. Misters available when heat cranks up a bit more.  Friend has a 10% off coupon in her wallet - so can't complain on price ;-)"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is the beer.  As for the rest, imagine overpaying for not-so-good food in a restaurant that smells like dirty dishwater and looks like it came from chain restaurant heaven.  I guess I just prefer local restaurants over chains."}
{"text":"Visited on Fri, June 1st. Great service, quality, selection, and value. Our server, Devin, did great making sure we were happy the entire time. No matter what you're in a mood for, they'll have it. Really can't beat the price, if you're looking for lower prices, then hit up a drive thru."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times now, and really like the vibe of this place.  I've had good service each time I visited, and enjoyed quite a few of the vegetarian options.  Their black bean burger is delicious!  The beer selection here, of course, is awesome, as well.  This is one of my go-to places in town, for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner this past weekend. Ordered the BBQ burger with fries, calamari, and a creme brulee. The burger was pretty damn good. I'm not a fan of garlic fries, so I probably ate maybe half of those. The calamari was decent but the portion for an appetizer was kind of small. The creme brulee was probably the worst I've ever had, not sure what the deal with that is. If I go back, I'll probably stick with the burger."}
{"text":"Everything started out very very good.  We were seated very quickly upon arrival.  Our server was a little weird but paid good attention to us. The Asian chicken by appetizer was delicious.  Here's where the story goes downhill... My wife was survey rock hard avocado on her chicken BLT focaccia bread sandwich. Like it was so hard she pulled it off of the sandwich and could not even mash it with a fork. The fish and chips were so-so the fish was very very bland and I'm from Alaska so I know what good fish should taste like. We will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Not being a meat eater, it's hard for me to find a place that offers a dish that I don't have to make changes to, but this place had a seasonal dish: butternut squash farfalle. Squash, pasta, pecans, pesto sauce and roma tomatoes and beyond wonderful.  My husband ordered a burger and it came with garlic fries. Not garlic salt, but real garlic and he couldn't get enough.  We each ordered a beer and when mine came, I was really sad, because it tasted like Coors (I had ordered one of their brews). A moment later our waitress returned with another beer and apologizes, saying she had grabbed the wrong one (it was a Bud Lite). I am not sure of which one I ordered, but it was incredibly good.  The staff was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Just OK, Can never go bad with the biers at Gordon Biersch. Service was very good, food was below normal. Wife had mac with lobster and shrimp, I had the lobster bisque and streak frites, Mac and lobster and the lobster bisque was somewhat bland tasting while the streak frites were overly salted."}
{"text":"Looking for a mediocre dining experience coupled with inattentive staff for which you can overpay? Look no further than Gordon Biersch!  \"A less tasty, more expensive BJ's,\" as a I typically refer to it, Gordon Biersch is frustrating in its shockingly bland menu, served by staff who don't know how to keep a drink refilled (but frequently just hang around and chat amongst themselves) and quickly stop caring about you once the food is delivered.  I've had a number of bad experiences, from waiting nearly an hour and a half to get our (by then, lukewarm) food during their busy time, with nary a care from our waiter, to having the wait staff completely abandon us after delivering the check, despite it being a slow weeknight and the fact that we were clearly sticking around to talk business for awhile.   The menu is like an upgraded Applebees. The food is shocking in its blandness, like a hodgepodge of tex-mex, americana, and stunning mediocrity. Entrees will routinely run you between $16-$20 and won't be worth it, they won't cook a burger the way you ask, (\"to a minimum of 155°\") and things are just generally unpleasant.  People love the garlic fries, but it's just shitty frozen fries doused in what I imagine is canned garlic. I'm not expecting the world here; it's a chain micro-brewery, but these fries do NOT deserve the rave reviews they sometimes get.  The pasta dishes are more of the same: Sysco or thereabouts quality but just wholly lacking flavor and inspiration. Everything feels phoned in, and the entire place just rubs me the wrong way. I've had the misfortune of continuing to come back because it's close to my office and clients like it for some reason.   Generally, I'll avoid if at all possible. It really leaves a lot to be desired at prices that magnify their shortcomings."}
{"text":"We had a terrific experience at Gordon Biersch near Westgate.  We sat on the patio.  I ordered the Bourbon Chicken which came with a kale/quinoa salad and choice of additional side.  I chose grilled asparagus.  Perfect.  My husband ordered the Cajun Pasta and he was equally impressed.  The Happy Hour was in swing so we ordered a couple of mojitos which were also mighty yummy.  $3 off the mixed drinks, $2 off wine, and $1 off their home brewed beers.  We also were surprised with a birthday dessert; warm brownie with a scoop of vanilla.  We didn't need the extra calories but we darn near licked the plate.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our server's, Mimi, service and our dinners.  Thank you! Well worth the price."}
{"text":"What I wished I knew before heading in; happy hour is from 4-7 and only applies to the patio, bar, and cocktail area. It explains why the whole back area was dead. Probably better that I didn't do happy hour anyways because it would egg me to drink and eat more than I need to.   Sitting in the back was nice because it was away from the crowd and allowed for comfortable conversation. I had ordered the seafood cobb salad (13.95) with a side of tangy and miso vinaigrette. The salad itself was massive, coming in one of those large pho bowls. The toppings were generous except when it came to the actual seafood. There were three shrimp cut in half and a light sprinkling of thinly shredded crab meat. My friend's Kobe beef burger (13.95) was good. The meat was juicy and tender. The burger comes with the basic garnish so that it does not detract from the taste of the meat. Paired with the garlic fries, it is a fine meal. The fries were awesome; crispy and the garlic was not overbearing.  The beers are reasonable; five dollars for my Marzen and 5.50 for his summer seasonal.   The service was attentive enough to where we got our waters refilled, but nothing more. In the end we left filled."}
{"text":"Great food and pretty good all around beer. The Schwartz beer worth trying as a sessionable black lager. Wit and Hefe will keep you relaxed in the summer!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the food.  I had a short braised steak with mushrooms & mashed potatoes.  The flavor of the dish was good, but the meat inedible and tough.  My friend had the lobster Mac and cheese.  The pasta was mushy.  Great location next to the university and our waiter was great.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go and eat. I hardly come to Tempe but after coming here for the first time, I plan on going back. Great food, service was excellent and the VIEW is amazing (From the patio)."}
{"text":"Really good, consistent beers on tap. I have yet to find a seasonal that they brew that is not good. The whole menu is a bit on the pricey side, but the quality more than makes up for it. Some personal faves are the Maibock (already on my calendar) and the Winter ale. I was just there recently to check out their Rye ale that was outstanding. Definitely a beer place with food on the side.  Usually, I just pop in for a couple of pints as a mid stop on Mill Ave. The bar is always a good choice and the patio is pretty sweet on during Fall/Winter/Spring season that we have in AZ.  DON'T FORGET THE GARLIC FRIES!"}
{"text":"Amazing view, amazing food. I love this place because of the view, it's on the second story on Mill Avenue, in Tempe Arizona. They have hand crafted beers, don't expect any domestic beers. The food selection is amazing. You can have anywhere from the basic cheeseburger, to Kobe beef burgers. Today I had ahi tuna  and it was cooked perfect. It was served with a kale and quinoa salad. Perfect for lunch. They get deducted a star because the service was just a tad slow and all the windows are filthy with fingerprints. It doesn't take much to wash the windows."}
{"text":"I've visited this Biersch location several times over the years, for varying reasons.   More often than not it was to relax on a Friday after a completing a long and strenuous week of formatting excel spreadsheets.  Their happy hour is good for beer.   There are several \"speciality\" cocktails which are available as happy hour specials but they are mostly very sweet, fruit based concoctions.  I'd much prefer to be able to just get a $5 jack and coke, but that's just me.   None of the happy hour food offerings are exactly groundbreaking fare, but most of it is tasty and a steal at the happy hour prices.  The best of those options to me are the Southwest Combo which comes with Pork sliders, southwest egg rolls and the famous garlic fries.  Also the tapas for $5 are a steal for the flatbread with hummus and some other dips/toppings.  None of the mediterranean restaurants around town should be shaking in their boots over the quality of this plate, but it was certainly better than I expected it to be when I ordered it.     I've also been a few times for lunch, and the last time I went I tried the Moroccan salmon entree.   The salmon was well cooked and I really enjoyed the spices used in the preparation of it.   I tend to prefer my salmon to not be smothered in a lot of sauce or spices that mask the flavor of the fish itself, and this version pleased me in that respect.   I don't remember the price point but I did think it was maybe a few dollars too expensive especially during lunch (it wasn't on any special lunch menu), but ultimately it was worth it.  What sets this location of a chain that specializes in 3 star food IMO is the service.  95% of the time I've gone the service has been excellent.   Drinks are refilled quickly, and the waitresses are very friendly even when we're being loud and obnoxious after our 4th round of beers and asking for the channel to be changed on one of the many TVs around the bar area showing various sports.  And that basically sums up my happy hour needs in a nutshell.  Biersch succeeds"}
{"text":"We had seat outside enjoying the perfect weather.  I thought it was very unusual for a brewery to be so quiet on a Saturday night.  However across at Hooters, it was loud and full with action.   They were watching the UFC fight.  It must be an exciting fight.  How do you compete with UFC and Hooters?  I have been to this location a few times.  They must have changed their menu and increased their prices.  It's been awhile... I had the garlic fries, not bad, but still like Six Flags Magic Mountain's better.  My friends had ordered the cobb salad and spinach salad.  They were generously portioned.   If it wasn't that I just attended an Oktoberfest event, I would have ordered from their Oktoberfest menu.  Actually, the items on the Oktoberfest menu sounded delicious."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere and clean.  Service decent/friendly.  Let me preface this is a brewery and if your here for beer im sure its a winner.  I'm here for the food and I've been to other locations in the past.   Garlic Fries are not my gig - those seem to get a lot of attention.  The burger I had today just wasn't very palatable until I added a thick layer of mustard and ketchup.  It's just ok and being I can't remember what I ate previously I'm thinking this is my fair rating.  No lunch specials.  I did receive  a happy hour discount voucher on the way out which was nice."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what my obsession was/has been with Gordon Biersch when I'm in Tempe... but I think I ate lunch here like 3 or 4 times when I was here for 6 days. I guess after being out in the sun drinking beer all day, I can't think of anything better then sitting on the balcony with a salad and some Marzen. Gordon Biersch's handcrafted beers are delish. You can get a beer sampler and try them all. The food here has never failed me, but I like to keep it simple when eating lunch (salad, burger, etc.) The restaurant itself is really clean, huge, and very modern. All in all, a great place to stop for a bite to eat and some good beer.  p.s. the garlic fries are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour beer prices in the house brews are fantastic deals- just 3$ on all GB beers. Service is good, but the Happy Hour food choices are too few. Overall, not a bad experience, but could be better with more HH food choices."}
{"text":"I have never been ignored and treated this poorly anywhere. It's NEVER acceptable to be treated like you don't matter. First in and last to be acknowledged 25 minutes later. Our server Lonnie was the ONLY bright spot. The entire room was given menus and water, and we were LAST to receive them. It must be nice to be so arrogant, that you don't care about money. I will laugh when this place goes out of business. They have no business being in business. There's no sense of urgency and customer service whatsoever. The place wasn't as busy as they normally are. These people just don't care. NEVER AGAIN!!!! I'll go to the Boulevard Bar and Grille where I can get waited on and where I matter. What's the point of getting up on a Sunday morning early just to be ignored so all the tables around he can get water and menus and I have nothing. No thank you.  The waiter insisted I at least have their jalapeño ranch dressing on the side when I did not want it at all. He pushed even further and insisted I try it when I told him I didn't want it in the first place. About 30 minutes later I threw up. All I could taste was that damn dressing that I didn't want in the first place! That was the last straw for me so I left. I wasn't read it on the way out and nor was I greeted on the way in. This place reeks of arrogance. The only things that were good with the music and the company. Other than that I should've stayed home. It's not worth the 45 minute drive from sunrise Mountain."}
{"text":"My family and I came here after an ASU convocation and had a wonderful time. We expected the place to be crowded after such a large event, but they accommodated to my party of 6 and was very kind and helpful! We had a fantastic server and he was easily accessible and friendly, I wish I could remember his name. The food was great and happy hour prices/options were great as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting about this location.  Only the Tempe location comes to mind.  Regardless, they have good happy hour prices (in the bar only).  The mini brat slider is decent.  As well is the beer battered fish slider.  It wasn't as battered as we had expected.  The charcuterie board wasn't very impressive.  There was more meat than cheese.  Please refer to my picture lol.  Their homemade chips are yummy.  I mean really good.  Which makes the prosciutto & Gorgonzola chips good.  I'm not even a fan of Gorgonzola, but the combination may have killed the strong Gorgonzola taste."}
{"text":"The food here was ok. The lobster mac and cheese didn't have as much lobster as I would have wanted for the price but that aside it was good. The tenderloin tips and mash potato were ok  but I wish they would have come with a side salad, just felt like something was missing. Also had the artichoke dip which was was probably the best part of the meal. The disappointing part came at the end when the bill came and we asked the waitress to divide the $111 bill by 3 and charge each of our cards equally.  She charged the other two people in our party $30 each and gave me a receipt that showed she'd charged me $60 it wasn't until I got back to the hotel and got a bank alert that I realized she had charged the entire $111 amount to my card in addition to the $30 a piece she charged to my coworker's cards. When I called and spoke to the manager she said she was already aware of what had happened. 5 days later still waiting on that credit....."}
{"text":"Service was great....that's all!  Ordered crab dip as appetizer.  The crostini was soggy and chewy and clearly has been sitting around waiting for an order! It also came with a flatbread that was like chewing rubber.  It too has been sitting around waiting for an order.  My \"seasonal\" vegetables were saturated in salt and I'm a saltaholic so that's really really bad!  Not edible!  Wait staff was exceptional but the food was the worst I've had in a long time.  Manager comped the crab appetizer and that was very much appreciated but I would not return to this location based solely on the food..... I would hired the staff in a minute!!"}
{"text":"Pepper jack lobster and shrimp tacos blue corn tortilia black beans and rice, very cold beer! Good service."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, they used to have all sorts of beer and an amazing happy hour.  Service was still great, the waitress was plenty friendly, but apparently they redid the place to make it feel more \"classy\" but c'mon it's a brewery, not a 5 star restaurant.  Happy hour used to be $4-5max for apps that were $8-9, now they upped the prices of everything so the apps are $8-12 DURING happy hour. They used to have a vast beer selection that was affordable ($2-3off happy hr) but now during happy hour you only get $1 off beers which is such a misleading \"Happy Hour\".  Being the brewery that it is I would have expected to come in and get the pilsner I always get there, but now they don't even carry a pilsner... What kind of \"brewery\" doesn't carry such a common type of beer??  I never thought I'd be leaving a negative review for Gordon Biersch but they have forever lost my business."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery which was on time but it was too bad because I would have returned the chicken schnitzel because the bottom was burned and the whole piece had a burnt taste even after I tried to scrape the the burnt bottom off. The root beer was flat! At least the brownie was good. Ice cream wasn't melted and sauces were still easy to pour. But I won't be trusting them for a delivery order again."}
{"text":"Last time I was here with Dalton the service was crappy. This time the guy never asked to refill my iced tea and tried to take away my plate before I was finished. Then he was back like every minute to see if I was finished. I felt like I was being rushed out! And why are the garlic fries always burnt? Only reason I don't give them two stars is the free wi-fi and Steelers game on the big screen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite summer late night happy hour hang out! Bartender James is the coolest!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We were visiting from California and a local friend recommended this location. The staff was very attentive and kind. The environment inside was lively and active. I would definitely come back again and recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I want to first start out by saying I love this place and I go often as it is close to where I live.  Second I would like to stand up for the spectacular bartenders and waiters/waitresses, as I have seen many reviews that state there is bad service.  I will be honest sometimes I do not sit at the bar and sit at a table top in the bar area and once in a great while I may get someone who is not the best, however, if you sit at the bar, will you get great service.  My favorite bartender is Matt.  He is extremely friendly and is very attentive.  I also used to go more often during the day for lunch.  Forgive me for not remembering her name, there is a wonderful bartender there during lunch, she has short hair.  I feel bad because no matter how long it has been since I have been there she has always remembered me.  The food I love, the drinks are even better and I am not a beer drinker.  As long as I am being totally honest, I agree with Vincent K and his review of the manger."}
{"text":"Legendary Garlic Fries are outstanding. One of the few places that uses real garlic and not garlic seasoning. The garlic fries are not apart of the happy hour but are well worth it. From the happy hour menu, we ordered the wings (half beer glaze and half Cajun dry rub, both are phenomenal) and the flatbread pizza. Even though we only got three items, we were stuffed. On top of the food, I had their house hefe which is the best hefe I have ever had. The smooth and crisp flavor leaves you refreshed and wanting more. Happy hour is Sunday-Friday 3pm-6pm/10pm-Close and Saturday  open-5pm/10pm-Close. A must try if you're by UNLV and an overall great happy hour experience with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was ok..but for reals I am totally disgusted that the cooks in the back don't wear gloves when they touch raw meat and then touch ready to eat food..that is so dangerous. The few that had gloves anyways would touch there faces pull up there pants and what not which totally defeats the purpose of having gloves.  I talked to the waiter and he was cool he told them they needed to but they still didn't..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ever eating at this restaurant. I started off with the sampler of there house brews.  I then ordered the jambalaya for my entree.  The beer was half way decent, and I enjoyed the knowledgeable presentation by our waiter who was very outstanding by the way.  The jambalaya was decent I was disappointed in the lack of seasoning, overcooked rice, and lack of meat.  Overall it was an ok experience, but our waiter is the reason I most definitely will return to this place to try the other menu options."}
{"text":"Had a group of 22 people here. Great location for a large group and friendly staff. Left my credit by accident. Within an hour, I had fraudulent charges on the card. Too bad. Good place. Don't forget to pick up your card after writing a nice tip to the wait staff."}
{"text":"Good service and a great spinach salad last week for lunch. Close to my office which really helps as well."}
{"text":"Load up on the beer and Gordon Biersch Garlic Fries. That is all you will need for the rest of the night. If you'd like you can always enjoy some Glazed Chicken Wings, Southwest Egg Rolls, Seafood Cobb Salad, Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye, Grilled Chilean Sea Bass, Halibut Oscar, Chicken Parmesan, Meatloaf, and more! Did I mention the Gordon Biersch Garlic Fries?  Otherwise, you can count on feeling like you are in a typical sports bar filled with local strangers."}
{"text":"Came here to eat for my best friends graduation dinner. We had a very large party but were seated very quickly (with no reservations).   Service was good. Drinks were refilled quickly and our server seemed to always be around if we needed to ask for something.  Food:  I ordered the Cajun pasta and a side of garlic fries (you can't come to gordon biersch and not order some garlic fries). The fries were amazing, of course. But I was very disappointed in my pasta. It had a really weird powdery taste. My best friend tasted it and she said it must have been the type of seasoning/spice they used. I ate a few bites, but just gave up and gorged on my fries. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and we all had a good time so I wasn't too unhappy."}
{"text":"German food here is 10 times better than Hofbrauhaus!!!!  We went for Oktoberfest and they had a special menu with some German favorites on it. I got the sausage sampler [and why not I am in Vegas after all!].  It was delish!!!  Homemade mustards were to die for.  And the red smashed potatoes with kraut, pork and onions was AMAZING.  My friend kept stealing bites of my mashed potatoes b/c he liked it so much.  I had to be on the defense for the fork war that was going on.  You can't find something on the menu here you have BIG issues.  It's almost overwhelming when you open it up there's a little bit of everything- seafood, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, German fare, burgers, Asian, etc you the idea  They do have low calorie options as well; however,  I did not participate in them on this experience.  Beer sampler is a steal at $5.75 esp when a regular beer is $5.25"}
{"text":"Imperial Pilsner was truly a great beer. The tuna steak was good. That is as good as it gets here. Service was slow. Left the bar area and asked for a regular table. Had to flag waiter down for service. Though Biersch restaurants are typically on the slow side for service this was bad. Managers seemed more concerned about their take home food stash.  Finally ordered and they could not remember salad dressing request. Quinoa salad was loaded with parsley. Sweet potato fries were extra charge and served room temp. Had to flag waiter for additional service. This was at a slow hour.  Dinner and beer was $44. Not a great night here."}
{"text":"The IPA here is very good. The red ale Belgian missed the mark. Most of their beers are low alcohol and not very malty. This is a huge mistake for a large regional brewer to not follow the trend. Their Imperial lager is great when available but have not seen it in a while. Food is never better than average. Management really needs to improve food and add some robust beer."}
{"text":"Awful service and unremarkable food. How does someone mess up a brownie? Unbelievable. Also, telling a patron their food is \"Taking a little bit longer because you ordered it without shrimp\" makes no sense at all. It's one less ingredient and should, therefore, take less time. C'mon, you had an hour."}
{"text":"Good food, but witnessed the grill chef use tongs to put a raw piece of chicken on the grill and use the same ones to pull a cooked one and put it on a sandwich. MAJOR NO NO IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY! Some times its not good for a restaurant to have an open kitchen. I've have managed restaurants in my life and is why I noticed this. I informed the manager and he handled the situation properly. Unfortunately this is something I had to report to the public, so this can be looked at by corporate and handled ,so hopefully someone doesn't get sick. P.s. there marzen beer is very good. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"My aunt was in town so I made a reservation.  Our table was ready upon arrival. I had visited once before so thought it was a good place. Overall the menu has numerous options for various tastes which is always great with a large group of 8. Service wasn't great this time. We were greeted instantly but were not yet ready to order drinks because we didn't get time to look at the menu, and water was already on the table, so we asked for a couple of minutes which ended up feeling like 10 min before she checked back, and even longer before the drinks came. Each check in took awhile and we actually had to wave her down for refills of iced tea, after trying to make eye contact a number of times.  The atmosphere was a bit loud, but manageable, but the heat from the kitchen and open floor plan was unbearable. My aunt had to put her hair up.  I ordered steak which was very good, my aunt got the pasta, and others got various food items.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The mushroom chicken pasta seemed to be the best presented, large bowl and she had leftovers for tomorrow.  We were not offered dessert until i asked my table if they wanted anything, but not a big deal (just one of my pet peeves)  The waitress instead asked if we wanted it all on one check.  I'm sure I will go back due to its location and variety."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this  restaurant for a couple of years now. We love everything about it. My only suggestion would be for the cooks to wear hair nets! Last time I was there a couple of months ago with my luck I found a hair on the blue crab and artichoke dip. This would my only negative."}
{"text":"Well apparently they don't serve color folks. My girlfriend and I were seated right by the kitchen,  we came 5 minutes before another couple that sat right next to us. A waitress went up to them first asked for their drink came out with it in two seconds and left. Still didn't acknowledge us. Until we made a comment a waitress finally decides to talk to us..but we will have to wait because she is setting up a table for a new set of folks.   They can keep their food. Not spending my money at a place like that."}
{"text":"what lured me to come to gb is my free entree deal I received through the email for my upcoming b-day....sweet. I had until the end of the month to use the coupon.  giving GB four stars with one caveat: don't come at a time the resto is totally full because most likely you won't get good service, at least that is my experience here. we went on at lunch time today and received pleasant service and we both enjoyed our entrees... We both ordered the BBQ salmon, with jasmine rice, and red onions, spinach. they also accommodated my special request. i couldn't resist and i had one hefe which was nice and mr h had the czech pilsner."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends from work and I came here for happy hour which is ordinarily a good hang. After spending a good amount they a party next to us who proceeded to light up a smelly cigar and was blowing it i our faces. In disgust we moved all the way to the other side of the patio to escape but the smell followed us. The management agreed it was disgusting and yet did nothing about it. Any decent restaurant would have a no cigar policy out of respect for the other patrons. We will take our considerable Hilton business with us elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers because it is really close to work. I wish they had a lunch menu but they don't carry it anymore. Food is good but slightly pricey without the lunch menu. Service is great and overall it is a good place to go for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been a customer here for years. I am also a part of their rewards program, which is absolutely worth it. It pays back a whole bunch when you frequent as much as I do. I rarely eat here, as I always come for the late night happy hour drinks. They have new daily drink specials. My friends and I never miss half priced wine Monday's, and late night happy hour is from 10:00-Midnight. The staff and management is wonderful. They always accommodate and are friendly, to say the least. I absolutely recommend coming here if you want good eats and cheap drinks! It's close to the strip, but the prices don't seem that way."}
{"text":"The Marzen beer was sooo yummy! As was the Pomegranate Lemonade. Mm! I had a blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich and it was also incredible.  A lot of people are comparing this place to BJ's in Southern California but what they're forgetting is that the food at BJ's is barely one step above dog food!! It's pretty foul. In comparison, Gordon Biersch is a freakin' five-star restaurant.  The quality of the food was great, the prices were reasonable, the garlic fries were yummy, and I wish the only location of GB that we had in SoCal hadn't gone out of business a couple years ago!!  I would recommend checking this place out for dinner instead of lunch-- a lot of their entrees sounded really good, but even in Vegas I had a hard time letting myself order a $18 plate of pasta for lunch! The sandwiches were amazing too, though."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and beer selections. How can you beat Happy Hour 7days a week! Also great service."}
{"text":"Before this place was bought out by Tennessee or Colorado based Craftworks this chain was great. Now their quality has gone down their food is very bad. I have eaten at several locations in California and this location in Nevada and it was great. Not sure what Craftworks. Their history on their website doesn't even reflect their current parent company. Sad thing for a great company."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The menu had waayy more than i expected when i thought \"brewery\". 9pm-close is reverse happy hour and that was all we ordered off of and everything was fantastic. crab and artichoke dip *(req to have it with the bread instead of the cracker, TRUST me),  and yes i will admit we actually had two orders of the dip..it was that scrumptious! shrimp with chili sauce, pork sliders..all yummy! The have combo meals as well on the HH menu. The happy hour choices are great. We will be back to try the real menu as well, i looked it over and it is pretty intriguing.  We had the beer sampler. No this place dies not have the widest selection of beers but the ones they have are pretty good. Check out the seasonal when you go...they also have a huge list of mixed drinks and wines as well.  Atmosphere is nice, low lights, music, t.v's upstairs, outside seating also. Service was just o.k. he left us alone(ignored), but its o.k. we were just fine being left alone in our little love bubble."}
{"text":"I honestly come here for the spinach bean burger, with unsalted fries on the side.  I just love it so much.. haha I know i sound over exaggerating. But don't knock til you try it. So I replaced the buns and use spinach instead, and i add jalapeños to it. Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The feeling to this plave is like Bj's, its nice.  The service here is very slow, but it was quick to take the check. But overall. 5 stars for the bean burger. 3 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Dinner was great server, stellar beer choices and other cocktails. Not sure if they updated the menu but I'm not a fan wish the sausage platter had the patty's still was good."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped in at this restaurant on a whim one day. The bartender that served us become one of the coolest chicks we have ever met and made us feel really special, so special that when we walked back in the next week for happy hour she yelled our names with excitement to see us like we family! That makes you feel good! The beers are great, the food is great! Lots of TV's to watch sports. And they have a great happy hour and incentives for being a loyal customer! Go see Christy (Twiggy) the bartender, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch, meeting up with my brother-in-law, who lives in town.  We came pretty early in the day, so the place wasn't that busy.  Which meant that our service was excellent.  Our server, Diane, kept on coming by to check on us and refill our drinks.  I ordered the Montecristo sandwich, which was served with a side of maple syrup.  While it may not sound good to many people, it was heaven to this sweet tooth!    To counteract this, we ordered a side of garlic fries to share.  While many places do Garlic fries, Gordon Biersch has the best.  The fries were very hot and fresh, with just the right amount of garlic.  Often, places overwhelm this dish with garlic, but not Gordon Biersch.  If you ever grave garlic fries, come here."}
{"text":"So good! I got the Lobster & Shrimp Macaroni and Cheese and it was AMAZING! A large portion though, enough for 2 to share! Not too rich but perfect comfort food! Burgers look very good and well-made, as well as all of the salads! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Glad I got to visit this restaurant today during happy hour.  Their prices were great and so were the portion sizes.  I got my Mediterranean Chicken from the light menu so I was expecting something small, but it was decent and I was still left feeling satisfied.  The staff was very friendly and I noticed they all really work together to serve their customers. The gentleman who was helping us out knew his beer and was able to tell us the types of flavors to expect from each.  We got the beer sampler, so since this guy knew his product he suggested the order in which to drink them - and he was on point.  This place is great for lunch with family, small business meetings, or early evening drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ocktoberfest Sausage Platter during October season menu. It was delicious. The meal had simmered bratwurst and cheddarwurst sausages that were grilled. The sides were so tasty.  I had sauerkraut mashed potato croquettes and braised red cabbage. Plus, there was beer mustard sauces to dip sausages in. This meal is great!  Also, the Fest Bier is one of my favorite beers too. Also, the server provided amazing service.  I had a fun time at Gordon Biersch."}
{"text":"As a regular of this chain,  this is by far the WORST FOOD I have tried to eat. Consistency in food preparation does not exist between locations.  The House Salad was incredibly small for the price and compared to other locations. The chicken wings dry (lacking glaze) and over cooked.  It would ne irresponsible of me to recommend this to anyone. This establishment is far to exspensive have an extremely poor quality of food product. I will not ever return."}
{"text":"Came in with some friends,  1st time.  Service was way too slow,  we didn't get our happy hour prices for our beers. Food was good though and love the patio. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The waitress took my drink for a refill and literally never brought it back. When I asked her about it she admitted that she \"totally forgot\" and accused me of trying to complain to get a free dessert. Um, no, I just wanted the drink that I ordered.   I ordered my salad with dressing on the side. When the salad arrived it was completely drenched in dressing. When I asked the waitress about this, she glared at me, then she snatched the salad and took off stomping toward the kitchen.  My mom ordered the veggie burger, which was completely inedible. It was not cooked all the way through, and it was like someone had just slathered refried beans onto a bun. Also, it was frozen in the middle.   My mom asked the waitress if they could cook her burger, which was clearly frozen in the middle. That's when the waitress really lost it. She started screaming at me, waving her arms in the air, yelling, \"This is a restaurant. I'm going to get my chef so you can tell him to his face!\" I tried to deescalate the situation, telling her that wasn't necessary, when she lost it at me, yelling, \"THIS IS A RESTAURANT!!!\" Then, she tried to stare me down as she stomped back towards the kitchen.   K, she clearly wanted us to know that we were in a restaurant. In my experience, a restaurant should be able to 1) refill drinks, 2) not accuse customers of trying to get free dessert because you \"totally forgot\" their drink refill, 3) accommodate simple requests like dressing on the side, 4) not serve frozen burgers, and 5) not scream and yell and customers who ask you for basic service. All of those things can ultimately be forgiven, but yelling at customers and trying to stare them down is not acceptable.   Gordon Biersch = Worst restaurant experience in Boca Park, hands down."}
{"text":"Reserved an area for a coworkers retirement party and they provided us 4 counter height tables with ten chairs. We previously told them we expected 40-50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having about 30 people standing up the entire time. We all wanted to order food, but without sufficient tables, there was nowhere for us to actually eat the food.   We asked if we could get additional tables or be seated elsewhere, and they said NO because the tables were for customers. (?!?) the restaurant was about 80-90% empty at this point.   We tried to sit at the nearly empty bar, but the shoo'd us away because they said they were expecting customers. I'm not sure what they thought we were, but we were a group of 40-50 teachers (who made reservations) at the end of the school year. If anyone is going to order a ton of drinks, it is a group of teachers at the end of the school year.   From the moment we walked in, they constantly told us we weren't customers, even though we had called weeks ahead and reserved an area. We had all planned on drinking and ordering a lot of food. They didn't want to serve us and made it very clear.   Our server was hostile. When I spoke to the manager, she said, \"what do you want me to do about it? The seating areas are for customers.\" Also, the manager told us we couldn't stand near the tables because of fire code. Have I mentioned that the restaurant was 80% empty and they refused to seat us or allow to sit at the bar? They basically gave us a 10x10 area to stand in.   The bottom line is that this restaurant basically refused to serve a group of 50 teachers who had made a reservation for a party."}
{"text":"I am in love with the waitress we had for lunch here today. We ended up waiting for over an hour for a friend to meet us, and she couldn't have been more good-natured about it. She just kept refilling our drinks and cracking jokes about the situation, and when the bill came, she even put up with dividing it three ways for us. I wish I could remember her name.  The food was also delicious. The selection was amazing- the salads and pastas looked beautiful, and my veggie pizza was among the best I've had. It's an ordinary pizza with a twist: tomato pesto instead of tomato sauce, and topped with artichoke hearts, fresh tomatoes, and lightly sauteed spinach. Soooo good, and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. And unfortunately, the mini fridge in this hotel room is crammed with overpriced booze. No space for my yummo leftovers :("}
{"text":"My first visit to Gordon Biersch was a pleasant one. I like the decor- comfortable seating, interesting things to look at. I like when restaurants are broken up into smaller spaces, like this one is. There's a raised section with booths, a bar with a flat screen TV, and a back area with a glassed in section with wi-fi (you have to pay to use that space).   Nice wood floors help create a warm atmosphere.  The meal I had was pretty good but nothing special: fish and fries. However, the garlic fries were definitely tasty.  The service was good, the prices all right. Bottom line: I'd come again and I'd recommend it to friends for an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Up until last night the only Gordon Biersch I every tried was the concessions at Chase Field. It was there where I fell in love with their garlic fries.  After leaving a Cardinals game, my friend and I decided to stop in for a snack and a beer or 3. As we drive up we see the sign...Happy Hour Daily (including Weekends) until 6:30. SWEET!! We took our seats at the patio bar and were quickly greeted and served. The happy hour menu had some great, very nicely priced options. And of course I just want the garlic fries.  The patio was great and casual and the inside was warm and contemporary but still casual. As the sun set the fire pit got going and provided some nice ambiance.   It was also on this night that I performed my good deed for the day....from out of no where came a sharp, shrill SCREAM!!!! Everyone turns in the direction of the commotion. I look over to see a man and a lady in a panicked state, jumping around....What was it? What's wrong? The whole restaurant is looking. They could barely speak, mostly pointing I see it....a very large grasshopper, about 3-4in long sitting on the edge of the lady's chair. Quickly and without hesitation, I offered my services calmly but quickly going up to the chair and capturing the grasshopper and then walking over to release it over the patio wall. The man he was embarrassed but I received a gracious \"Thank You!\" from the lady. And plenty of \"Good Job!\" from my fellow patio patrons."}
{"text":"Good consistent food and great beer. Really only come for their great happy hour and to watch football and of course the garlic frys"}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE AT GB  Having a gluten and grain allergy, it is difficult to find a restaurant where I can eat and not get sick. Today, my husband and I had an awesome lunch at Gordon Biersch without me having any symptoms of cross contamination (which trust me, I feel immediately).  I was hesitant to even try this place as they didn't have a dedicated gluten free menu; however, when we walked in the manager-- Matt-- was very knowledgeable about gluten and assured me he could help me find things on the menu.  After Matt sat us, he spent time comparing an allergy menu to the regular menu.  He was awesomely patient going through ingredients, etc.  I decided on a caesar salad with  warm grilled chicken.  After he took our orders and explained them to our waitress, he went back to the kitchen to make sure the staff understood the precautions.  My husband had a salad too, and although his was not gluten free he said it was equally as fresh and delicious.  When we had finished our meal, Matt even came back to check on us and make sure everything was okay.  I highly recommend GB on Rampart whether you have a food allergy or not!  Their attention to detail and obvious care for customers was admirable.  ADDENDUM:  My husband and I went back to GB last evening, and the evening crew definitely didn't have gluten knowledge down like the servers/manager (Matt) from the day crew.  The waitress thought gluten was in oil (???), and she told me that the entire meal I ate the day before was \"definitely not gluten free!\"  For a split second I hoped for a gluten miracle; had I been cured of my celiac?...Very doubtful, and  so when I heard that comment, I asked for the manager, Amanda, to help.  While Amanda was very nice and totally willing to assist, I had to prompt her to get allergen book that Manager Matt had shown us the day before in helping me to find gluten/wheat free food.  Amanda admitted she was not totally aware of allergens, which I found odd for a manager of a restaurant who also admitted that there are \"so many gluten allergies these days.\"  We went through the allergen book and I ordered the exact same thing I had the day before--caesar salad with  warm grilled chicken. I asked her to instruct the kitchen to change gloves, use new bowls, etc. to avoid cross contamination (something that Manager Matt brought up before I could).  By that time, the waitress was totally into this and she monitored the kitchen to make sure those directions were followed....And, I lived.    Moral of the story: If you have an allergy to anything, you still have to be a self advocate.  At  least at GB, you can ask for the allergen book, figure it out yourself, and survive to write about it the next day."}
{"text":"My girfriend and I love this place. Anytime we are in Tempe, we go to Gordon Biersch, anytime we have someone in town, we bring them here and never have a problem. The food is great, the beer is Great, the staff is great!!! Did I mention that the beer is Great, they are a brewery, so you can watch them make beer and wish that you could go swimming in that big pool of beer, mmmm, beer. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on the way to a show tonight at the Hilton because it was convenient and Ellis Island had a ridiculously long retarded wait at both restaurants when we went there first.  I just didn't feel like eating at the sports book at the Hilton since it is mostly junk.  Thankfully they seated us really fast and served our food fast and were out of there in 30 minutes in time to make our show.  I had the classic cobb salad which was fresh and tasty, and the balsamic (that has beer in it) was pretty good.  My husband had the Marzen BBQ chicken sandwich and he inhaled it but later said it was \"just ok.\"  He didn't like the garlic herb fries.  I ate some of them but I prefer my fries with just traditional with sea salt or kosher salt on them.  I wish they would give you the option of not having anything but salt on them.  Anyway I'm giving this place three stars because I liked it (even though husband wasn't thrilled with it) and they served us a decent meal before our Joshua Tree show."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here has been wonderful. Very fresh. The service is good. The food is wonderful. I have eaten at this one and the one in Glendale. Excellent food in both locations."}
{"text":"I have visited this location frequently and can never get enough of the bar area and outdoor patio. I love the seating area and the comfortable and casual vibe.   Every visit is pretty consistent and pretty good. If you're in the mood, the best dish here is the lobster and shrimp mac n cheese! It is so delicious and never disappoints. I remember my first time trying this years ago to the most recent and every time I'm satisfied. Although the dish has become smaller and smaller the flavor is still amazing!   Other than that dish, the others are okay and not really worth raving about. However, it hasn't stopped me from coming back, enjoying the vibe, brews and trying something new. I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"The dark wood and seat coverings give GB a very intimate and cozy feel. Happy hour drink prices are as good as any for hand mixed cocktails. The bartender was great. She's super efficient and friendly. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff, and really good beer. What else could you want from a restaurant?"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with my wife. Staff was not friendly from the start. Everyone had a scowl on their face and seemed rather displeased to be there. Lunch and two drinks was 44 bucks which consisted of a hamburger and a sausage plate. I was not pleased with the portion size for the cost. Our sever was MIA during our lunch. We didn't even get the check until we went to the hostess counter and asked for it. Then we got it when the waitress rudely slapped it on the counter and stated 'here'. I believe there is a management issue at this location. I will not return, there is a lot of variety available in the San Tan."}
{"text":"Always has great beer. The Vegas spot is a little sparse on the clientele in the evening, so don't expect to ignite your night here, but it is a great alternative to the Hofbrauhaus. Three stars, but solely on atmosphere - Vegas is all about the people you meet.   Food not rated."}
{"text":"One of the few \"normal\" places on Mill Avenue!  Great food, great happy hours and great servers/bartenders! What more could you ask for!  We were in town moving our son back for his junior year at ASU and found this place to be a refuge to relax, have some drinks and good food and great conversation with their lovely staff!  We even broke our tradition of taking our son to dinner at Culinary Dropout before we left and took him here instead as it was much more convenient and way less expensive after all the move in costs!  Thank you Tamra, Logan, Janessa!  Wish i would have gotten the others names!"}
{"text":"I love craft beer and a consistent experience, and so I'm a fan of Gordon Biersch, BJs and Karl Strauss.   The menu is what you expect- burgers, pizza, some chicken/salmon/salad/pasta staples.   Gordon Biersch is a safe familiar environment when you just want a place with craft brews and a kids menu, in short, you are a family of 4 with a couple 12 YO, you love beer, but don't want to fork over $100 for a la carte lunch with root beer served in a $5 bottle to those little treasures of yours.  Only reason I knock off a star is because at some point within last year Gordon Biersch changed their amazing garlic laden shoe string fries into blah, thick cut, little flavor ones while still calling them \"world famous\".  Um, no. World famous ones were the pre-overhaul ones, these fries suck and are beyond blah. Much heartbreak. That and turkey burger needs much work. Otherwise, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We went in during happy hour. The beer was great and we both loved the Hefeweizen with the hint of banana. We tried some of the happy hour foods including the pork & Kobe sliders with garlic fries and the calamari. I absolutely loved the pork sliders. The flavor of the pork with the coleslaw was great. My husband and son really like the beef. The garlic fries were awesome. None of us liked the calamari. The batter was greasy and lacked flavor. I definitely would not order it again. Aside from that everything else was really good and the beer will bring us back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was average to below average.  Typical american style cuisine with no imagination.  Taste was average, you get the same thing from a Denny's.  Prices are really high due to the \"name\".  I'd rather eat a $7 burger at Denny's than a $12 burger from this place cuz the taste and quality are about the same. Not impressed and won't return unless someone else is footing the bill!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant a week and a half ago for one last dinner in Vegas.  I had a delicious burger with a beer and my wife had a chicken dish.  We also shared a calimari appetizer before we got our main courses.  The venue was stylishly decorated and the food was very succulent.  The only drawback was a slightly messy table when we first came in (just a few crumbs) and also the waiters seemed to take a long time for a slow night.  The place was partially filled so unless the crew was vastly understaffed there would be no reason for the food/extra orders to take so long.  So for those minor reasons they get 4/5 stars.  The chocolate melting cake is to die for... Otherwise, good place to go!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Lots of amazing draft beer and good food."}
{"text":"Quality beers and good food. $2.50 beers during the day. A nice break from the costs on the strip. Pizza, burgers (including Kobe), sandwiches and full entrees. Wide selection that should have something for everyone."}
{"text":"German environment nice. Every table around us seated after us and served prior to us.  Portion sizes are small for the price. Beer was good! Never returning."}
{"text":"Go to there happy hour. 3pm-7pm, good selection I recommend the slider combo. Good variety."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and Danny was a fantastic server.    Have to start with the garlic fries!!    It's a must.    Tried the sweet and sour wings and the mild wings which were both delicious.   The spicy chicken lettuce tacos were fresh and flavorful. Also had the fish and chips which were light and fluffy. Try the Pumpkin Ale- nice and smooth."}
{"text":"Great view of \"A\" mountain and Mill Ave on their patio.  Good beers too.  Food is decent as well.  If you want to save some bucks check out their happy hour.  Service is usually pretty good too.  This place is huge as well.  It's a little bit more upscale brewery but not too fancy that you can't afford to come here."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices, and good service.  It's a newer building and it has a great patio and the misters will keep you very cool.  Most of the apps are pretty good.  I tried the Martzan beer and I wasn't a big fan, I think I will stick to the lighter beer."}
{"text":"My buddy and I just had an amazing Hefeweizen. Was smooth and had a great aftertaste. My friend had the beer Battered fish and chips. It was very generous helping and he said they were very good. The chips on the side were true chips and tasted great. We had some of the garlic fries and I usually don't love garlic fries unless they are a restaurant specialty but they were good too. When my steak was not cooked how I asked I hesitated to bring it up but both the waiter and manager said it clearly wasn't right and apologizes. They took the steak dinner off the tab which I tried to dispute to no avail. A very generous tip was in order. We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Arrived just in time for happy hour!   As a first time patron, it took us - a party of 4 - a bit of time to go over their menu. Getting drinks wasn't the problem - we just couldn't make up our mind with appetizers because we didn't want to order ALL OF THEM.   We ended up with:   * Beer Infused Mussels: the mussels were great, BUT, dipping the bread in the broth upped this dish!   * NOLA Yellowfin Tuna: fresh and went great with the bed of sauce beneath it. The veggies and the pita bread were great cleansers.   * Southwest Eggrolls: These were bigger than the ones I'm used to being served at happy hour on some random place. Wasn't too cheesy and it did well even without the dip.   * Individual Grass-Fed Beef Slider: Hubbers got one (medium) and was pretty good for the price!   * GB Wings (Full Order): Very typical buffalo wings. Went pretty well with our drinks, but nothing too special about it.   * For the life of me, I can't remember the last appetizer we ordered. But 'eh. It was pretty darn good.   Our server, Birdy (aka Aileen - there's an interesting story to her preferred name, by the way, so ask her about it!) was such a cheerful, patient and funny attendant.   Being it happy hour, the prices were more than reasonable.   We all had a wonderful experience! I'd probably make a stop on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sliders, one brat,one hamburger, and one French dip. The French dip would have tasted great, but as you can see in the pic, the meat was less than a mouthful. The waitress was nice and said the kitchen was going to make another one for me, double the meat. This new slider took approximately 25 minutes to get. By the time it got to me, I wasn't hungry anymore, although it tasted pretty good. My husband ordered the beef tips in a mushroom sauce, and it tasted good, but wasn't enough for him to eat. All in all, I think the GB in San Tan is much better"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is ambient. One big complaint from my dad (who's not in yelp) is that the beer mugs are not chilled. He had two beers and both were warm. He put ice from his water in both beers. For a \"beer\" place, the temperature of the beer should be a major focus. We are disappointed Gordon biersch!"}
{"text":"I went to Gordon Biersch for a birthday party at the beginning of the month.  I had fun, but it had little to do with the establishment.  We had a special \"deal\" of $17 because we were such a big party.  There were soft drinks included in the price, but alcohol was more.  I have no issue with this, but the food was not very good.  I had a pasta dish and it was fine, but I am not dying to eat it again.  Then, we get our bills.  The price was not $17, there was additional tax and tip added on (which again is fine, but deceptive when we were told it would be $17 per person).  Then, my pregnant friend had a cranberry juice and sparkling water.  This apparently was not on the included menu and she was charged a $2 alcohol fee for her non-alcoholic beverage.  It just seemed a bit fishy to me.  Had it been an excellent meal, I wouldn't care about a few bucks, but it was just ok."}
{"text":"Had the Kobe Cheese burger with garlic fries. Hands down amazing! Garlic fries are not too garlicky and the burger was nice and juicy!"}
{"text":"I visit this location when staying at Residence Inn across the street. The food is terrific and the service is great.  It goes without saying they have a good variety of their own beers in-house.  This allows me to sample their brews freely without the worry of driving home as I can just walk across the street."}
{"text":"We have been going to Gordon Biersch for many years and normally go for the happy hour as we did this night. There happy hour has changed quite a bit over the last couple years as has the menu.  Sometimes I do not think they know exactly what kind of restaurant they want to be.  As with most places the prices tend to creep up with each menu change and that has been happening quite often lately.  As far as the food goes we rarely find something on the menu that we do not like as there is a lot to choose from.  Make sure you join there rewards club for free food and drink and specials."}
{"text":"I was very unhappy and just downright unimpressed with this meal. I went to a G.B.'s a while ago and really liked it, so I decided I'd try again. Only this time when I went it was after the Cactus Bowl and it was a catastrophe. I was not at the game but was shopping with the family. We figured that we would eat instead of waiting in line in traffic.   This place was trashed!!! The bathroom was destroyed with that looked like urine all over the place and no towels. I immediately informed the hostess, I am not sure if it got remedied right away, but it was bad.   We got seating in a timely manner, considering, and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. She was great.   The beer is wonderful. I loved it. Still do.   The food was so bad that I sent it back and lost my appetite. This night they had a limited menu and there was not much to choose from. I mean it was like 8-10 items, maybe. It came out fast, which makes me think they are just making it and heat-lamping it until it is ordered. But it was just bad. But for $25-$30 a plate, there is an expected level of quality that was just not there.   Now, I know that this was a special occasion, but I was just really unhappy with a $60 bill where I don't eat. It is just unnerving. I would like to pay and be fed and be happy, that's what the business is all about. I feel like a restaurant that size, in that location, knowing what was going to be happening that day, would really prepare for the tidal waves of people and make the best of it. They just couldn't keep up and it might not be fair to judge them off of this encounter. But, nevertheless, it happened.   I would like to give G.B.'s another try sometime, but it may be a while because this experience has me a little jaded."}
{"text":"I gave it one star because I had to.  I was here this past Sunday for a get together.  Our waiter was slow, but in his defense he seemed overworked.  The party room we were in had the ac blasting and we all had our coats on while eating despite asking if the ac could be turned down which never was.  The French fries were old and cold and we asked for new ones only to have the ones sent back reheated in a microwave.  So disappointing!  The fish had waaaaay too much breading and had absolutely no flavor.  Their homemade root beer is missing the 'root' part because it tasted horrible and was sent back as well.  I can see why I lived here for 3 years and never went.  I will never go back.  They did have a live band which was cool.  Don't waste your time, stay home and cook."}
{"text":"I didn't try the food, so this is just coming in for drinks on a Friday night.   My husband and I went upstairs to the upstairs bar and we wanted to sit on the patio, but it was quite chilly for us. Our waitress was nice and we loved the beer selection. This is one of those restaurants where it wouldn't be bad to bring in your family as the crowd seemed more mature than the other bars located in the area."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials at this place! The staff is always super friendly and helpful! Highly recommend the egg rolls on the happy hour menu. Usually sit at the bar and get drinks super fast."}
{"text":"Eh, their beer is good but I like more selection. Their food is done well, but far from spectacular. If it's not happy hour, it's kinda not worth it..."}
{"text":"Great place for business meals. I go here regularly."}
{"text":"Great service, great beer, and...this was before a Cardinals home game and no wait! Don't let the few bad reviews and overall rating deter you. GB is solid for date nights or gamedays."}
{"text":"Reverse Happy Hour on a Friday night? thank you very much! I ordered the Heffenweisen (delicious), calamari (it was ok), friend artichoke hearts (delicious) and the Kobe Sliders (yummy). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Micro brewed beers! And they're decent. If you're like me and you prefer to step outside of the usual Coors Light and Blue Moon, Gordon Biersch is a solid choice. And speaking of choices, I was really stuck. I didn't know which one I really wanted. But there's no reason to let that be a hold up - they'll do a sampler, where you get a 3 ounce glass of each of the six beers that they brew on site. Golden Export, Hefeweizen, Pilsner, Märzen, Schwarzbier and the seasonal which this time is the Winterbock.  I decided to sit in the bar area, where they have a few TV's tuned into the latest sporting event. No sound though.  Nice menu of bar foods and decent entrees, but I stuck with something that would go well with the beer. The plate of housemade chips, which were topped with cheese and their winterbock chili. Excellent stuff, I cleaned the plate!  Overall, good good, good service, good beer. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the open feel to the restaurant. Took a little time to get a seat at the bar but worth the wait. Went on a Sunday and had a great live band playing. House beers were great! GARLIC FRIES ARE THE BEST!!! Definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great service from Larry. The beers were good, and Larry offered some really good suggestions.  Our food was good. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"So we went back and have tried this place two more times now. They have obviously changed management.  The menu is much better. Both meals were absolutely awesome service was absolutely spot on and the manager also recognized us from prior service. I would recommend this restaurant again, they seem to turn everything around"}
{"text":"Ok nothing to rave about chain food restaurant. Don't get the crab artichoke dip but the lobster tacos were pretty good. Burgers weren't anything is return for."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill - Beer was flat and not very cold - waiter brought me spicy wings when I wanted the sweet wings, he never asked me which type I wanted - only got 2 chips with my bratwurst slider - I'm a stein member, really use to love this place. Almost empty on a Saturday night, place just not happening any more."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! We had a rough start to the night, thanks to the hostess and server for saving the night. We had the burger and fish and chips. It was great."}
{"text":"If you like beer even a bit, then you are coming here. They have a wide beer selection, from traditional German, to modern American crafts. I tried the hefeweizen and it was pretty tasty.    For what it is, this place isn't terrible. Good atmosphere, open seating and fast service. Not overly thrilled with the food, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Enjoy going here for happy hour.  We were there on 12/23/15 and sat in bar.  Krista was behind the bar and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome!  I personally love to order the sampler, when I'm not driving of course.  When I ordered it last time, they were out of one of the beers, but they still charged me the full price for the sampler, which I think is unreasonable.  The food is pretty expensive.  It's very good, but it's not a favorite.  The salads are really the best thing on the menu.  Everything else is just mediocre.  Once again, besides the beer.  I do love the view and the location.  There's also an elevator for those who can't do the stairs."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised! It's been a bery long time since we last tried Gordon Biersch (Tempe location). I remember it being good, fairly standard salads and brewery fare. This was REALLY GOOD. The fried mushroom risotto is excellent. French dip sliders have onions, and are very good. Simple but I really enjoyed it. Husband had mini brat sliders and loved them. We also shared the Mahi Mahi with veggies and rice. Everything was exceptionally good.   We just shared those 3 things, as we were not starving but wanted to try a few things. Executive Chef personally came by, talked with us for a while, and was extremely nice.   Our Server was also extremely attentive and nice. He made the recommendations for us, and was very pleasant.   We will definitely be regulars when we go out (although it is very, very rare - hopefully if we get out more, we will come here). :) Chef was very kind to give us a deal. Thank you. 5 star service and food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was served by a Kevin and literally, I had to ask for every single thing (plates, silverware,) water was never around and every-time I did ask for something, Kevin looked pissed.  Called the manager, named Kenny. He was useless too. Never again will I eat at this place."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I visited Gordon Biersch.  I remember when the first one opened on Paradise, and it was the place to be for the trendy.  That was a long time ago, and now this chain is just another take on the likes of Yard House, Chicago Brewing and such.  What I remember from my last visit at a San Diego branch was that the food was very good, beer was good, and atmosphere was great.  My latest visit to the Boca Park location results in a bit of a downgrade in food and chic factor, but otherwise still quite satisfying.  We met up with my friend and his wife, and were really looking forward to their restaurant week deal - $40 for a 3 course.  Alas, that was only for the Paradise location... why is that?  So only mildly disappointed (since we figured we'd probably spend less money now), we proceed to order a couple of apps - calamari and blue crab artichoke dip - and entrees.  Seafood Cobb Salad, Lobster & Shrimp Mac 'n Cheese for me, Fish & Chips, and Cajun Fish tacos.  The calamari was very good, rightly crisped coating with perfect taste, albeit the calamari weren't exactly plump.  The artichoke dip was disappointing, as it tasted too sour cream-y and the crab flavor got lost in it.  I couldn't tell if there were  actual crabs in it or not.  And I think it would have been better with tortilla chips rather than bread.  I had the Mac 'n Cheese because the mix of it with lobster & shrimp sounded interesting.  What I got wasn't exactly Mac 'n Cheese though, it was Bowtie 'n Cheese as the pasta was not macaroni pasta.  Loses the effect a bit, but it tasted like a mac n' cheese so they're forgiven.  As for the taste, it tasted like typical mac, but the addition of the seafood definitely was for the better.  Ample chunks of lobster and shrimp went quite well with the cheese and pasta mix.  A dash of truffle oil would have put it out of the park, I think.  Also tried the fish n chips, and while appropriately crispy and tasted fine, I would have preferred a more traditional batter than the more panko crust-like one they use.  Didn't try the cobb but it was humongous, and the tacos were huge also (you get two).    The server was very pleasant throughout, but committed one no-no.  Towards the end of the meal she came by and dropped off the check, letting us know her shift was over and we need to settle.  I think this is a very bad practice, one that breaks up the rhythm and flow of the dinner for the patrons.  Why can't they let the next shift \"take over\" and settle the check instead when the customers are ready?  They were may be a quarter full, and don't they all share the tips anyway?  Still, not to detract from otherwise great service that deserves 4-stars in the end.    Four beers, couple glasses of wine, and it all came to $125 before tips.  Not bad, but I tend to think it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  Beer price is very reasonable though, at $3.75 a pint for the home brews.  Will likely revisit, but probably more for happy hour or apps and drinks, rather than for dinner.  All-in-all it's marginally 3.5 stars for food, and decidedly 3.5 stars overall.  This place may be the epitome of why Yelp should grant 1/2 stars.  Food-for-1 Factor:  Well, a big bar up front but the air in the place doesn't necessarily put single diners at ease.  May be a bit too social inside for eating/drinking by your lonesome..."}
{"text":"Craft beers were great. Food was good, but a bit pricey for what it was. Service was friendly. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here. So annoyed, I actually took the time to pick all the fish off of my 3-16$ fish tacos to show how much meat they put on all three tacos. I opened the first one and saw one quarter sized chunk. So if you love overpriced lettuce tacos you should definitely get these.  Posted pictures . I used to love this place, Idk what happened but their game is slipping preeetttyyyy baaaadddd! :("}
{"text":"So many great restaurants within walking distance and for some reason we decide on this one. Husband got the avocado chicken sandwich with garlic fries & the seasonal craft brew.  He said sandwich was the average, chicken sandwich. Nothing special or unique   I got the bbq bourbon chicken & shrimp entree.  Literally a chicken breast broiled then tossed in a Sweet bbq sauce. White rice & zucchini steamed. Barely was able to force that chicken down, so disgusting.  The shrimp was over cooked, over seasoned  & impossible to remove off the skewer. At least the beer & wine were cold..   $50 down the drain. My husband and I don't go out much & when we do, we want to enjoy it.  We both left still hungry and disappointed  Believe the ratings when they say it is overpriced and the food is terrible."}
{"text":"I come here for two things: their awesome outdoor patios and their Hefeweizen. (Correction: I do get cravings for their awesome Fried Artichokes appetizer, too).  The Patio -- there are two patios. One has a window that opens into the bar and has tall tables. The other has normal height tables, a sofa seating area, and a fire place. If you want to eat outside at Happy Hour, you need to go to the bar side patio. No need to wait to be seated.   The Hefeweizen -- while I'll take recommendations for great hef's (my search is still limited as of this writing), this place so far has the best one. It's creamy and, according to our server when I asked her what made theirs different, it's made with the genuine unfiltered true German technique -- or something like that -- where many other hef's are often not.  The Service -- It's hit and miss. If you get Donna, it's great. Sometimes with other servers we don't get noticed for very long periods of time, though, and we have to ask the bar tender to flag someone down. For a while we kept getting one very bad server. He was totally unhelpful, misinformed, and acted like he thought we were dorks. The last time we got him and he was rude, we asked the manager if we could get someone else. YAY! We got Donna! And we've never seen the rude guy there since (we go a lot).  The Food -- it's decent, nothing amazing, although the Fried Artichokes rock.   For vegans and vegetarians -- We've had different things custom-made and they're good about that. They have a great-sounding vegetarian pizza that us vegans have to pass on, but we always special order our cheese-less pizza and ask them to add fresh basil.   They have a vegetarian pasta dish. Unfortunately, their black beans and rice have an animal broth (boo!). The garlic fries are vegan. There are other sides and things we order and tell them to pass on the cheese.  But watch out -- the olive tepenade on the Tapas plate has anchovies. We have them double up the hummus or bruscetta topping instead."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Southwest Spring Rolls - Tasty.  Very good, but nothing you can't find at a chain like TGIF, Ruby Tuesday's or Applebees.  Entrees:  BBQ Ribs - Excellent!!! Served with Garlic fries, another winner.  However, again, nothing you can't find easily elsewhere...  Schnitzel - a disappointment, had no flavor  Beer - ugh!!!  Sadly, I was extremely disappointed.  Ordered the sampler, the Marzen was the best tasting and even then couldn't finish the whole glass.  All others were left behind.  Amstel Light tastes better than all of them, I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled having acquired my taste for beer while living in Belgium.  I guess nearly half a millenium of brewing heritage wasn't enough for me...  Otherwise, great looking restaurant, casual, great service, you can hear yourself talk, and if you're not too picky, I guess the beers might do..."}
{"text":"Amazing service. My steak was more well done than it should have been and they fixed the issue right away. The waitress invited the group I was with to an event they were having the following day. You can see that they really care about the customer experience."}
{"text":"Most of my run-ins with Gordon have been at an airport, so I was slightly skeptical of the quality.  Turns out I was pleasantly surprised.  The area was active with plenty of people watching and the temperature outside made it perfect to sit on the balcony.  The food was above average in taste but I would be afraid to check out the nutritional value of what I ate!  If beer is your thing, I think you will be happy with the variety and some of the more unique offerings.  Expect pub food and service and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had our monthly book club here. Was nice that we could make a reservation, but we probably didn't need it as it wasn't that busy on a Thursday night. Our server was good but seemed a little over-anxious to get our orders going. Portion sizes of salads are interesting. I had a seafood cobb, which was HUGE, and very tasty. Someone else ordered a dinner salad, which was still around the price of a full salad but she had about a third of what I did (and I could be generous in saying that- could have been a quarter size). I enjoyed the atmosphere very much, and wouldn't mind coming back and seeing what their other entrees are like. The pasta dish someone else ordered looked quite good. Yeah, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Gordon Biersch since I lived up in San Francisco. They were definitely one of the first breweries to start doing craft beer in the 90s. This location seems to always be off in my opinion. Service is good but the food usually comes out slow or incorrect. Plus they seem to be out of their beers from time to time. I have seen over the years them slowly decline in clients and customers so hopefully they will continue to stay open."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with a couple of friends... was very much popping they had a jazz band a lot of customers were dressed up as if the just came from church. We were sat in a cute corner booth had amazing beer on tap forgot which one.. my friend got the samples in beer which  i highly recommend ordering especially if you are not sure what beer you like. I ordered the crab dip for appetizer and the fish and chips which is a generous portion. Service and overall experience was great even though the  restaurant was As busy as it was. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Late night appetizers, perfect! Before arriving in Vegas, I heard this was a place to stop but I had no idea where it was. Going back to our hotel, it was on the way...awesome! Had to pop in. This place is huge and very cool!  We sat at the bar, ordered a Hefeweizen, mojito,  veggie personal pizza and the garlic fries. Holy moly! Never had more garlicy fries, ever. I figured this was normal so we just ate and ate. Then we see the couple next to us who surprisingly ordered the same exact things..their fries were no where near as greasy or garlicy.  We ask one of the bartenders which fries are \"right\" and he says those, pointing to the couple's and that ours were beyond garlicy...What happens next? He bring out more fries, eek! Needless to say, we ate 30% of them. They were so much better than our first ones and we can't have them go to waste, right?!  The veggie pizza was great, never had one that the spinach wasn't cooked but we liked it!  The mojito was delicious and so was the large hefeweizen. Mmm!  So happy Gordon Biersch just popped up on our route. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed mainly for the food. It's mediocre and kind of reminds me of a Ruby Tuesday. They have a hard time getting the cook on their steaks right.   This place is not good for private dining. Their private room is a narrow room off the main dining room separated by curtains, so the noise level is there. Also, they can't manage timing because half the table received their food and the others took a good 10 minutes so the first waves food died on the plate. Not good!  Only positive was the wait am staff was friendly and beer was good."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars mostly because they have really good happy hour specials.  The wife and I had craft cocktails (Elderflower &a Cranberry Martini and Blackberry Whiskey Lemonade) for $6 each and they were delicious.  Then we forged ourselves on the happy hour menu: grass fed cheeseburger sliders, southwest nachos, southwest egg rolls, French dip slider, and a mini cheese pizza for $45 (including drinks).  I was happy with the friendly service and the great food so this one got an extra star."}
{"text":"Okay, first off, I'm one of those people that come here strictly for food and not beer.  Don't judge me.  I've frequent this certain location off-and-on ever since Westgate opened.  The location is ideal --- far away from the bars, stores, and movie theater yet close enough for a short walk.  Parking here is always plentiful.  From all the times I've been here, I would say they're the busiest during dinner.  If you're lucky enough to be here at certain times, take advantage of their Happy Hour and reverse Happy Hour.  Food is generally cheaper and you get plenty of food.  I recommend the Slider Combo~  My favorite things served here:  Garlic fries, lobster bisque, and the ribeye with gorgonzola butter.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Food not the best. I ordered French fries and my friend ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  Server brought us regular French fries and garlic fries.  No big deal, we just sent the garlic fries back and waited on the mashed potatoes to come.  After my friend finished eating her Brussel sprouts, we flagged the server down to find out about her mashed potatoes.  Instead of acknowledging that maybe he made a mistake thinking we had ordered the garlic fries instead of potatoes, he mumbled to himself and went to the kitchen to grab the mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were truly the only reason we even wanted to dine at GB - these tasted nothing like what we are used to eating at this location.  My friend took 2 bites and slide the dish to the edge of the table - done.  I ordered nachos that I didn't care for so I also slid that to the side (ate about 3).  The regular fries were great!    Here is where I have a problem.  #1 the wrong food was brought and forgotten  #2 The server NEVER asked us about our food.  It was clear that we were not eating our food - this was never checked on or acknowledged.  #3  We sat there for a good 10 minutes at least, not eating hoping someone would bring a check - mind you I'm on my lunch break and have been in the restaurant for 45+ minutes.  #4 after making eye contact with our server, he quickly looked away and had someone else come ask if there was something she could help with.  Seems like he was scared to speak with us?    Very disappointing experience all around.  I will never be dining at GB again.  I paid over $20 for garbage food that wasn't even eaten."}
{"text":"Beer/ restaurant.  This place was recommended by a friend in the area as well as the hotel front desk so we ambled over to grab something to eat after flying all day.  The place is located on the upper floors of the a busy corner building and the entrance is not that noticeable (at least not to us it wasn't) but after a little back and forth, we figured it out and walked up.  Grabbed a high top at the bar area and the super friendly waitress came right over.  The place has a decent selection of beers and a good sized menu so we were able to  get out libation going and some food ordered in short order.  I was looking for something on the healthier side- grilled veggie tacos looked like the best bet and they turned out to be pretty good.  Washed it all down with a nice Czech pilsner and skipped dessert.  The interior was sort of something between a Houston's and a western kind of thing- again, maybe to us easterners that is how it looks.  Solid, middle of the road and I would hit it again if in the area.  Parking on the street,."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. I've been here On two occasions where the wait was ridiculous, and their food is not amazing like it used to be. It's sad when this happens to restaurants. I used to love you guys :("}
{"text":"Food was great and the server was an expert. Knew the beers inside and out and his pairing skills were on point. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never had such horrible service in a restaurant. I was there with my husband and son around four in the afternoon on a Thursday, so it was not busy. In fact, there was one other table of 3, but they had a different waitress. That means that our table of three was the only table our waitress was serving. Everything was slow because she kept going off to do things like fold napkins. My husband ordered a second beer and we saw it sitting on the bar for over 10 minutes. During this time, my husband and son were without anything to drink with their food, so I finally took my son's water glass to the bar to get a refill. I planned to ask for my husbands beer when I was helped. The bartender was talking to the only two people at the bar as I stood there waiting. Then, she walked away. I cannot say for sure if she saw me, but if she did not see me it was because she was paying absolutely no attention since I was standing 4 stools down from the other customers. Finally, the waitress for the other table of three, that was now gone, offered to get me some water and checked on the beer that was sitting on the bar to see if it was ours. So, my husband finally got his drink and my son had more water. A few minutes later, our waitress finally showed up. She didn't even notice that we had gotten our own water and beer and never even apologized when we pointed it out. With this type of service, we would never go back to or recommend this location. We have been to other Gordon Biersch locations and the food at this one was not as good as the others I have been to. Not bad, but not great. No wonder they don't offer a survey on their receipts like most restaurants these days. I have the name of our waitress, but will not post it here. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch has an upstairs outside patio, where you can sit and look down at Mill while enjoying food and beer. It's one of the few accommodations that drew me in - not to mention they have their own beer to sample. I chose the seasonal. It was pretty good, although very, very filling. I couldn't even drink 1/2 of it after having dinner (shrimp salad) and another beer (22 oz) prior to coming here. So, if you plan to drink their beer, make sure you bring your extra stomach along. You're gonna need it.   As for the food, never had it. I can't speak to that, but it looks like serve American fare - like pizzas and burgers. They also have a very tempting dessert menu. I should know. My brother and I checked it out last night, after learning you get a free dessert on your birthday. Since it was a birthday for both of us, we contemplated getting one, like the apple bread pudding or the chocolate peanut butter cup pie.   Service was beyond horrible. Sure, we were quickly shown to a table, but it took several moments for our server to come over. She took our drink orders and told us about the free dessert - after all, I did let her know it was a special day. My bro and I drank and talked, enjoying the night air. Yet when we decided to leave, we could not find our server anywhere. We waited. We looked around. We waited some more. We finally decided to get up and leave. We found her standing at the hostess table doing nothing. That's when she was like, \"Do you guys want to close your tab out?\" Uh, yeah. That's what we wanted 20 minutes ago, missy. So, we slapped down $15 (our tab was $14 for one beer and one Rum Runner - whoa) and left.   \"What if we had wanted something to eat?\" my brother asked. \"Yeah, I said. She didn't even check.\" We just shook our heads and both agreed we probably wouldn't ever go back. Or, if I did, I'd know not to set my expectations too high.  On a more positive note: my brother did say it was the best Rum Runner he's ever had. That's gotta be worth something, right? I've had their mojitos before - meh. While I know they have a full bar, I think having their own in-house brewery is very cool."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. My family of 7 all had a different dish and all loved what what we ordered. The server was friendly and quick. The restaurant had a nice vibe and great views of downtown Tempe from the balcony seating. Not sure if kids would like this place, but adults sure will!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and obviously it will be my last. Though the waitstaff is very friendly one waiter took our drink order and then took off and we had a new waiter take our food order just a little off to me. All the food looked good we started off with a calamari appetizer which was a little greasy and than shared a double bacon burger there was something just not right with the flavor. 30 minutes later I realized that I was feeling very ill stomach pains cold and clammy the list goes on and on . Lightbulb moment I've been poisoned by the food not a good feeling still trying to keep it all together . So sorry we chose this place and a defiant mark  off my list . I did stop by the bathrooms on the way out to wash my hands there was paper all on the floor tiles coming off the walls sinks were dirty  not something you expect to see in a restaurant like this. So one and done Thank you for the  food poisoning but I will eat elsewhere ."}
{"text":"While staying in the area we went to Gordon Biersch twice (lunch/dinner).  Decent food, not a long wait and it's clean.   Their burgers were decent, tons of food and when they aren't super packed plenty of refills!"}
{"text":"Appetizer forgotten & then brought after our main courses were served, after we reminded our server. Asked for the dressing on the side for my salad, but it came dressed. Over-charged us for our drinks (which they fixed when I pointed it out). The food was pretty tasty, though. Nothing to write home about but good brats, pasta and chopped salad. Friendly if ditzy service."}
{"text":"Winterbier = delicious! Ahi tuna salad = fresh and tasty! Garlic fries = oh yeah, baby!  I only come here when we're in town for a convention and I always forget how yummy everything is.  The beer selection is incredible and I've loved everything I've tried.  The service is great... the waitress on our most recent visit was delightful and funny and quick.  Very important when you have a convention floor to return to.  Can't wait until next year - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service at this location.  Sunday afternoon open seating in the outside patio the waiter cleared the empty glasses off of our table from the previous customer without muttering a single word to us. After watching him have a five minute conversation with the table next to us about the parking problem at the mall we figure we may get better service inside. Boy we're we wrong.  Waitress took our drink order and brought them relatively quickly but that's about it.  Waiting for her to take the order and not coming back after the order was served made a usual 45 min lunch turn into an hour and a half! Ridiculous.  I had to go to the hostess desk and ask for a manager so I can pay my bill or would I finally get someone to pay attention to us if we just walked out!  First time in my life I didn't leave a tip.   Last time we will be spending our money at this location."}
{"text":"Typically I don't write bad reviews but the last time I went to this restaurant, during happy hour on a Friday they royally overcharged me for my appetizers and drinks.  I didn't pay much attention at first but then did a more thorough review of my receipt and was appalled by what I found.  Upon speaking the restaurant they didn't care.  Considering it was happy hour prices and I walked out spending over $60; let's just say I won't be back or recommending this place to anyone.  I would also encourage anyone who reads this to stay away, you are likely to face the same issues with their creative billing that I did."}
{"text":"Great beer, clean & modern brewpub atmosphere, and the food is above average as well.  If you're not into craft beer then you may not appreciate this place.    Beers are served in traditional 0.5litre glasses.  Seasonal brews offered 4-6 times per year.  Maibock is excellent.  Hefe-Weizen is excellent.    Don't skip the garlic fries."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere of the Gordon Biersch locations - I love the upstairs entry, the high ceiling dining, and scenic bar overlooking the beer equipment.  Great outdoor seating of Mill avenue, with planes landing overhead in the northeast.  Consistently good service & food, and I never miss the garlic fries.  Pizzas are a good choice as well if you're dining alone.  This was the original Gordon Biersch in Arizona back in the 90's and I wish they had some of their old ways - using 1 litre steins upon request, dunkel was on tap year round, as was the blonde bock.  They serve primarily German style lagers and ales which are almost all low hopped beers, so ignore the other reviews which are ignorant in their critique by complaining at the lack of highly hopped beers.  You don't go to a German themed beer place and expect something out of theme.  Silly."}
{"text":"Great beers served in traditional German 1/2 litre glassware with a diverse menu of American to American fusion entrees.  Garlic fries are one of their signature entrees, and the bread pudding dessert is one of my favorites.  Nice contemporary brewpub atmosphere, cute outdoor deck with fireplace & fire in the winter months.    Reliably good service & good corporate model.  I've had their frequent diner's club card for over 10 years now."}
{"text":"Even though those of us in the valley are blessed with all kinds of local brewery options, (Four Peaks, Sonora, Papago, etc.), sometimes I get a hankering to visit Gordon Biersch for one simple reason:  garlic fries.  I'll admit that all their food options, while good, scream out \"I'm a menu item from a giant chain brewery\" and lack that little something that makes it unique to your area.  Over the years I think that the quality of their beer has gone downhill.  The only thing really drinkable here is the Marzen, along with a couple of their seasonal brews.  As for plusses of this place, I'd really recommend sitting on the patio/terrace, which is great for sitting on and watching all the goings on happening on Mill.  Another plus is the staff: HOT!  Thank the lord for the close proximity to ASU and a great talent pool for hiring.  It may just be my tastes and likings, but Gordon Biersch is a bit too upscale for me.  It's tough to get out of these without spending over $25 on dinner and a couple of beers.  As far as breweries go, this is very family friendly, more so than the other options here in the valley."}
{"text":"First time I ever been to this Gordon Biersch was when I travelled with my buddies to Spring Break.  We really didn't know that areas too well, and we found what is kind of familiar name.  Everyone recognizes he Gordon Biersch award winning Garlic Fries!  So I went back for the first time now that I live in AZ.  Food is alright, but garlic fries and beer kicks butt!  Try their Winter Seasonal, it is refreshing. Some of their items are a little overpriced a little.  I will go back just for fries and beer!"}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch has gone through a lot of changes that have left some regulars with a bitter taste. We had the worst experience recently, and hope it was the last of its kind. Our party of 3 sat on the patio for Happy Hour. Our server was rushed and very rude. She didn't apply my free beer coupon until we went inside to find a manager. There was none in sight, but she came over to us and fixed it after we asked twice. I gave her the coupon when I ordered the beer.  She practically threw the checks down and only came back once for refills. When I asked for one, she said, I was told earlier you all were fine. WTF??? The beer is great, and my happy hour pizza was very good.  We were celebrating a birthday and wouldn't come back here if it wasn't for the Stein Club.  If an Ale House opens in the Summerlin area, GB is toast."}
{"text":"GB has a solid happy hour featuring a small ($1) daily discount on house drafts ($3 for all house drafts on Tuesdays!), specialty cocktail discounts and food specials. The food menu changes often & the food quality has been on a downward slide lately. They have a huge menu with plenty of apps, entrees and small plates. The flatbread pizza is a menu highlight, and usually there is something worth trying on the seasonal menu. The artichoke/crab dip app and the grilled veggie small salad are among my fave menu items. The beer is the highlight of the menu, & trying a sampler is a great start to the GB experience.  The brewery/restaurant is basically one large open area with a rectangular bar, dining room seating and a large patio as well. The chain's Stein Club members enjoy a slew of goodies and  weekly e-mail deals, as well as a free beer at all seasonal tapping parties. A recent promotion offered a free dessert, app or entree daily during the promo (for the next visit) with Stein Club card swipe. I went the first day and nothing showed up on my receipt. A manager was kind enough to offer me a comp. There always seems to be some issue with their promos, and this makes going there slightly less fun for me.  However, as long as the Stein Club is around, I'll be a GB Stein Club fan for life!"}
{"text":"We aren't huge fans of chain restaurants, but this is one of the couple chains we do frequent.   It was the beer that brought us in and probably what keeps us coming back.    Happy Hour is a good time to come and it goes until 6:30 where a lot of places stop at 6!    get the garlic fries if you are a lover of garlic.   Other good choices are the pulled pork sandwich or the crab cake sandwich!   mmm  Service is hit or miss at this location, but never so bad that we haven't wanted to return."}
{"text":"Came down for my best friend's wedding who got married at the chapel of flowers. The chapel had this restaurant as a recommendation for reception dinner. It was a good choice for the party. We got a nice size private room for the event. The wait staff was nice and very quick to accommodate anyone's special requests. I ordered the steak and it was pretty good. The artichoke cheese dip was delicious. Definite recommendation."}
{"text":"To put it simply:  We tried every beer and each one was delicious. We tried nearly the entire happy hour food menu and everything was delicious. The heated patio (it was a chilly afternoon) was clean, with a gorgeous view of the mountains. The service was exquisite  In short, this place is a gem and everyone that enjoys good beers, delicious food, and happy hour specials MUST go here."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch is a great place to go before a Phoenix Coyotes game. They have a good happy hour menu that is even on for game days (unlike Saddle Ranch). The staff is friendly and they are very attentive. They have a good micro-brews made in house.   My only complaint would be how small the happy hour menu is and that it's only available in the bar area. Otherwise, a solid."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Gordon Biersch was right after they opened, and we'd gone for Happy Hour.  That was before the economy tanked, and we had been spoiled by Kona Grill's HH offerings, which lamentably are now a ghost of its past glory (Bring back that Goat Cheese Pizza!!!).  Gordon just couldn't compare, so we never went back, that is, until we were invited for one of those \"Listen to Our Spiel and We'll Serve You Dinner\" events, held in the small private room wayyy in the back of the restaurant, even past the rest rooms.  Out the back door and we'd be on Lake Mead Blvd.  We had a choice of three items, preceded by a small Caesar salad:  Pasta Marinara, Chicken Teriyaki & Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken in Marzen sauce.  I ordered the chicken, having no idea what Marzen sauce was supposed to be - with an umlaut, no less - but I wasn't as smart as a friend of ours, who ordered it without any of the sauce, because that turned out to be a heavy, gloppy, pinkish concoction with mushrooms.  Hubby ordered the same thing.  It was served with garlic mashed and some soggy vegetables.  I realize that this dinner may not have been entirely representative of GB's usual fare, but it should be an enticement to get the patrons trapped for two full hours before a morsel of food was served (definitely NOT Gordon Biersch's doing, I'm sure) to want to come back and order from the regular menu.  Except for excellent service, nothing about the food will make my restaurant bucket list."}
{"text":"Gordon Biersch has some good things about this place, but overall, it's just meh.   Let start off with the good:  SERVICE: 5/5 The service was amazing. Our server was friendly and attentive, and checked up on us several times during our meal to make sure we had everything.  ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 The place is really nice, well-decorated, and clean. We came here when it opened at 11:00 am, but it quickly filled up with convention goers and business people close to the area. Despite this, I really enjoyed the casual vibe.  FOOD: 3/5 We ordered an artichoke and crab dip for starter. It was waaaayyy too cheesy (and I am not one to shy away from cheese). It was 90% cream cheese and 10% artichoke and crab. It was really disappointing, because we could hardly taste the artichoke and crab. They also didn't give us enough chips/bread, but we didn't want to finish it anyways.  My boyfriend had the Kobe cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. He said it was good, cooked well, but had a salty aftertaste. The sweet potato fries with ranch were yummy though.  I got the house made fish tacos with garlic fries. The tacos were meh. They were edible and okay, but definitely not memorable. The garlic fries were good, but so are the fries at McDonalds.   PRICING: 2/5 For the starter and two entrees, our meal was about $45. Definitely not worth it.   OVERALL: 3/5  Overall, I wouldn't come back unless it was to try the beer. There's a lot more places with the same pricing that offer better food."}
{"text":"This place is great. I go here with my fiance all the time. They have one of the best happy hours around... 9-close every day (even weekends) with $5 cocktails and cheap appetizers. The food is really exquisite.  EDIT: They killed their happy hour... it was corporate decision. It sucks now. My wife and I came in one day and the menu was just different. The waitress even agreed that the old one was far better."}
{"text":"Went this evening with relatives from the east coast.One member of our party of 4 is an avid brewery visitor,visiting microbreweries whenever he travels.I don't drink at all,but he's quite the beer connesseuir.So he did one of their beer sampler thingies and enjoyed a few of the brews.He said he's had better though. The resturant was empty and our server Ryan was incredibly polished and professional.He knew not only the Brewery/resturant's offerings,he was happy to make suggestions as well. He knew a lot about the Tempe area's fast paced history which endeared him to all of us.He was engaged,present and it was obvious he made it a point of bringing excellence to the table.Yes,pun intended. The food was plentiful,fresh and tasty. The prices fair for the portion and quality. Would I be back?Yes,under similar circumstances. Personally I despeise all that is Mill Ave with it's frat boy and girl mentality and am hard pressed to venture east of 24th street. I wasn't expecting much from a place I deemed \"touristy\",but was ever so pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times but I'm finally getting around to write a review. First of all it's in a great location, right on Mill Ave. You go up a flight of stairs and you'll be greeted  and seated usually fairly quickly. If it's not too hot or too cold you might want to try the outdoor patio. The view is nice and it's a bit quieter than the inside. As far as the food goes, it's not 5 star gourmet fair but they make an excellent burger and the garlic fries are out of this world. The beer selection is quite good and the service was prompt and cheerful. I've never had a bad meal or bad service here. Give it a try for yourself and see what you think."}
{"text":"Very chain restaurant atmosphere, but they have great cold beer and the garlic fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"Guess I've never reviewed this place before and so I just thought I would put one out there. I have only been here a handful of times and it was always someone else's choice. Why would anyone go to a boring chain restaurant when there are so many really excellent locally owned breweries in Phoenix and much better dining and drinking options right here on Mill Ave. I don't get it.  I have not yet found one of their beers that I enjoy and they don't really offer much of selection outside their own. The food is mostly greasy bar food. Last time I was there I got the \"Spinach, Fruit and Nut\" salad which was actually pretty good. Hence, the extra star."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and brewery food and amazing beers here.  While this doesn't have the same feel as the San Diego original location, the unique upper floor corner location is great for people watching.    Service was very very attentive, which was great, and the happy hour pricing was an awesome touch.   Although there are many non chain places on Mill Avenue, this is a great more adult location to watch college students acting stupid and to have delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"Over hyped, that's all I have to say about this place. The food is good but nothing great like what others ramble about. I might be in the wrong dishes but for now I feel a little disappointed is all. Expected way more flavor in each dish. Some things were so bland. Next time I'll give the recommendations a try !"}
{"text":"I don't understand how a brewery can make it hard to get a beer, but there I was at Gordon Biersch without a beer. After having to ask the server to wipe the table we were seated at, she did offer me a sample of a beer (yay) I liked it right away and said I would like a full size beer. It took well over 15 minutes to get that drink. In fact, my hubby finished his beer before I ever got mine.  The egg roll appetizer came out as my beer was brought out. The egg rolls were the best thing we had- they were tasty, and a little messy.  Plates would have been nice but getting the server's attention proved to not be in our favor. There were three of us for dinner and we ordered the salmon which was supposed to be cooked medium. It was very over done- very dry on the ends and the side of broccoli was barely warm. I ordered the fish tacos. Don't bother! A piece of fried cod in a small soft shell with a little drizzle and the smallest amount of cabbage is how they do theirs. Lackluster to say the least.  Our other order was the chicken schnitzel which wasn't bad but was a little greasy.  Overall pretty disappointing, especially because they have a lovely outdoor patio area and it would be nice to go again."}
{"text":"Just want to qualify my review before I get into it.  1) I don't really drink, so the extensive fine beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages was not a big draw for me. 2) I was there for a coworker's birthday dinner and we had a large group.  I arrived on time at Gordon Biersch, and there was only 1 couple that was there on time waiting for the rest of the group to show. I spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded at all for a Friday evening at 7pm. And they have already setup the table for our large party.   After debating what to order, I opted for the House Special Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye Steak. It is an 18 oz steak topped with Gorgonzola butter, served with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables for $27.95.  When it was served, the steak was definitely huge and cooked to my desired doneness of medium rare. But the flavor of the steak was totally underwhelming, and I question if they even used at least USDA Choice grade steak.  Pretty disappointing, considering that I can grill a mean steak at home or in the culinary school's kitchen.   A friend ordered a Vegetarian Pizza.  That looks good and although they were not hungry, they still managed to finished all of it.  Definitely a better sign.   Anyway, service was okay.  Our waitress kept coming back to ask if we were ready to order, but since not everyone has arrived we decided to wait and she had to come back several times.  So A+ for the patience in dealing with a large party and the indecision when it comes time to order.  But she lost some points for neglecting to mention that an additional 18% is automatically added to the amount charged when the credit card is swiped.  Even if the amount charged already factored in the mandatory 18% tip.  So had we not caught the billing irregularity, the waitress would have made way more than 18%.  So D- for that.   Also the water served didn't taste that good. I am sure they use some sort of water filtration system, but the Las Vegas water still won and what we were served tasted more like common tap water from Lake Mead. A lemon wedge would have helped masked the taste, but none were offered.   Overall, I would only give this Gordon Biersch a 2 star rating.  Food was just not that good. I am sure the beer is at least decent and at $5 per glass, that seems like a good price.  But food really was a major let down. The chicken wings were way too sweet. Bone-In Ribeye, which is one of the most expensive menu item, but had a Denny's taste.    I definitely would not recommend anyone to come here for the food alone.  If you need a place to hang out and get some beer and relax and watch ESPN, I guess you could come here, but there are way more better options around town."}
{"text":"Its ok....  Not the place for Wine... but surely the spot for beer and football. The brats were good and a variety of selection.  Shocked they ran out of some by 7pm? which was on the menu, so went with the general bratwurst and allowed my compadre to have the chicken and mixed sausage.  Anyhow they try to compromise and offer good service (at the bar) cause outside, waited... waited.... waited.... and waited for service.  Thus went to the bar knowing we would be seen, served and attended to."}
{"text":"We only had a beer here, but I liked the place a lot.  Everyone was really nice.  Lots of big screens.  Good sound system. The beer selection was superb!   I also watched the bartenders making cocktails.  They are really into it.  The restaurant part was packed.  The dishes looked good.  I'd like to try the food next time."}
{"text":"Ordered jalepano cream sauce over linguine with tilapia. Was their special of the day. One of the worst dishes I've ever had. Staff is bad, food is below average, but the beer is decent. The outdoor patio is nice, but lacking character. The garlic fries are good. Overall, go here because there are few choices in the \"land of chain food\"."}
{"text":"This is a great place especially because you have the workers/bar tenders working hard to take care of customers but they recently got a new Management staff and service is going the wrong direction. Hoping they get it figured out..."}
{"text":"I've been to several Gordon Biersch locations in different states and on multiple occasions.  This one by far was the worst and not what I've come to expect from Gordon Biersch.  I ordered a Kobe burger with garlic fries. Pretty straight forward right? Wrong. The Kobe burger was bland and looked unappetizing. They didn't bother to season it at all and it looked old.  Next, Gordon Biersch is known for their garlic fries. Well mine came out and again looked completely unappetizing. They were cold, no garlic on them, no seasoning of any sort. They looked like plain French fries. Since it was unlimited fries, I ordered more and it never came out. Did I mention service was super slow?   Next let me share what happened with other people in my party. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with plain fries. They gave her garlic fries. Oh, and by the way...my Kobe burger looked strikingly similar to her burger (like exactly the same). As you can imagine, the Kobe is more expensive because hypothetically speaking, it should be better quality beef.   My other friend had a sandwich with sweet potato fries.  She had unlimited fries and ordered more. It never came.   So overall, I think it's safe to say I won't be returning and I doubt my friends will either."}
{"text":"Ordered the ribeye medium rare with two sides: vegetables and garlic fries. The steak was cooked to med rare, but it tasted just okay not that tender and juicy. It was a little too salty and their house butter sauce all over the top of the steak was not that good. I ended up moving all the sauce off the steak. The cooked vegetables were ok, but the garlic fries were very pathetic..just regular fries sprinkled with garlic salt like. I don't know why they advertise it on the menu as legendary. The beer was good and always have been at this place. So 2.5 stars for the food experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by this GB too late for happy hour, but I was super hungry, so I was ready to get my eat on. I was perusing the menu when WHAT'S THIS?? They have a blue cheeseburger!! It was a Kobe blue cheeseburger I might add! It was called the Kobe Black & Blue and so my decision was made right then and there! I paired it was the seasonal brew, but I cannot remember what it's called! It was the strong ale. Anywho, the burger came with a knife shoved right in the middle! It was pretty funny. Nevertheless, I pulled it out and proceeded to eat the burger as delivered and not cut down into little lady like pieces. It was a nice thick patty that was relatively juicy. All in all it was a good burger. I just wish it had MORE blue cheese. In my book, you can really never have too much. My dining partner had the Kobe cheeseburger with a fried egg. Is that a Vegas thing? I've never seen soo many fried eggs on burgers before! HAHA! Anyways, good dining experience, but I **THINK** the Kobe burgers are a test out. I don't know if they are on the permanent GB menu (just my instinct, no one actually said this). I've never seen them on the menu before. I do believe the search continues! Next stop: The Cheesecake Factory's Blue Cheese B.L.T Burger!"}
{"text":"It's a chain so it is what it is. This location has cooks that can execute and the service is good. I tend to come for a quick drink/bite during happy hour or before a movie. They generally take my order quickly and get my drinks and food out right away. The food is hot and prepared correctly and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the  märzen-simmered bratwursts,  with sauerkraut & bacon potato croquettes and braised red cabbage.  Also had an order of french dip sliders.   To be honest I had relatively low expectations of the food just because of the location so close to ASU.  Surprisingly everything was really good.  Even though there were two of us there was enough food for three if not four.  Not sure if I'll be back to this location (mostly due to its proximity to ASU), but I'll probably go to another location"}
{"text":"Ordered the sausage plate and fish sliders.  Both were good.  However, the purple cabbage that came with the sausage plate was under done, too sweet and not enough vinegar.  For what its worth this is the second time I've ordered the sausage plate and at two different locations where the purple cabbage was overly sweet and lacking vinegar.  I beginning to think this is just the way they do it.    Regardless of the cabbage, the food was good."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for a happy hour and loved it! I ordered these little pretzels with hot dogs inside. I've heard it's their specialty and wasn't disappointed!!! I got only 2 of them, I should have gotten 3 lol! I never drink beer but this is a brewery and I got curious! My beer tasted so good! I will be back."}
{"text":"When in need of a happy hour or reverse happy hour, Gordon Biersch is usually a gold option. I hadn't been to one in some time but I remember the garlic fries being a must along with a beer on tap. They have a number of basic of bar food options to choose from and most are solid.   Service is basic and I enjoy the option of having indoor or outdoor dining at this location. I usually end up on the patio if it isn't too cold or hot."}
{"text":"I was here on a weeknight.  The place was empty and the food took so long to arrive, you get to that point where you just start looking around.  The manager would walk by and not say anything.  I guess she only talks to the regulars.  The food and beer were okay.  When we walked out the manager still didn't even say bye or thanks for coming.  Really? I wonder where they picked up that gem."}
{"text":"I had berry here before during the day for a lunch meal. My wife has also even here several times and the meals and service has food has always bern good. Well not today at 645pm, my family 6 adults and 4 children.  When we got to the door they said all the tables were reserved?? There was a lot of empty tables. They someone came and said they could seat us. We had a very short wait of less than 5 minuets. Our drink order was taken delivered is good time. Meals were ordered and about 5 minuets after ordering our waiter came back and retook part of the order as the paper had been lost. Could happen anywhere. Not a problem. Then we waited, and waited. it was an hour before our meals were delivered. It is now 7:45pm. The food was good. Almost. I had ordered a cob salad but wanted to leave out the garbanzo beens. The waitress said yes no problem. The beans had been added. When I told the waitress she said sorry. No offer to remake. Then I said I could not eat the beans and again she said sorry. Almost like saying pick them out. That is what I did. During the time refills or water and drinks were slow to not happening for several people.  Remember we was said all the tables were reserved?? Well in the area we were there was 20 empty tables when we sat down and when  we left there was 21 empty tables.   This was not a happy meal. Service was poor, attitude was poor, food was good. I may try them again. Maybe this was the waitresses first day. It was like we don't have enough staff tonight to serve you. Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for happy hour on a Tuesday. We were delighted to see the 21 oz beers were on happy hour special for $3 each. I had the triple C IPA and the coffee stout. My server took the initiative to bring me samples of the other two hoppy beers. The hostess was a delight as well.   We had the California Cobb flatbread and the boneless wing. Both were good but the flatbread was just outstanding. Great service, good food, and an excellent happy hour! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Little pricey. Portion sizes were normal.  There were four people in my group 2 out of the four entrees were cold. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"SECOND TIME IN TWO MONTHS  Trying to sit down sucks  20+ open tables and they say we need 10 minutes to sit you down because the kitchen is behind. How about we try sitting people offer a drink and let them know the kitchen is backed up. Poor communication and management isn't doing a good job talking to the people waiting for service and food.  So after waiting 10 minutes to sit down and 10 minutes waiting for a beer without someone taking our order we walked out and went next door to Thirsty Lion. The service was great had a beer in hand 2 minutes after sitting down and order was in in less then 5 Minutes. If you are reading this run out the door and walk next door."}
{"text":"Loved my Sunday afternoon enjoying the music of the great David Van Such and his band as well as good food, reasonably priced. Going back soon."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch yesterday and was disappointed in the service and the food. We sat for 15 minutes before a waitress finally asked us if we had been greeted yet, and when she discovered we hadn't said that she would \"steal\" this table from the other waitress and take care of us. It was not busy by any means, but the waitresses seemed to be more interested in gabbing than working. When our foodl arrived 2 of the 3 of us were less than thrilled with our meals. I had the fish tacos which had little meat and little taste to them at all. The other thing I really need to address is the foul smell that hits you when you step inside the door. I don't know if it is a sewer issue or old beer smell, but it isn't pleasant."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more considering it Gordon Ramsey. I ordered the fish a chips and I my fries were underdone greasy and cold and the fish was tough on one piece but actually pretty good. There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas and I don't think I'll waste my time on this one again."}
{"text":"I sat outside on the patio for 20 minutes. This was AFTER waiting at least 5 minutes for even a hostess at the front of the restaurant. They weren't busy at all . No server ever came out. I left and went across the street to bourbon jacks. Awful service. Will not return."}
{"text":"My caveat to this review is based on the fact that I only had water, which sounds odd but when co-workers want to have lunch and you have already eaten and there is a pokemon gathering, you can't pass it up.  I will say the consensus from my co-workers was the food was great and they enjoyed it.  The staff was friendly and we had a good time.  It is a nice break from the heat and located in a fun location."}
{"text":"I came to eat for Sunday brunch. Very nice restaurant. Five star review because of our server Chris. He had such a great personality and was so knowledgeable I ended up getting the ahi tuna nachos and a couple $3 mimosas. Yes only THREE DOLLARS! food was so yummy. I recommend sitting next to the live music and asking for Chris to be your server!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food (especially the Chicken Schnitzel) and the service was fast and friendly.  A very reliable restaurant with a nice atmosphere!"}
