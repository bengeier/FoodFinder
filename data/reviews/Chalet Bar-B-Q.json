{"text":"I've been eating here since I'm 10 years old. It's really the best chicken you will ever eat. It's like eating St.Hubert on steroids. The chicken skin is crispy and takes like wood charcoal. The meat falls apart. The sauce is awesome, very unique taste. The fries are the BEST fries you'll ever try. The coleslaw is the BEST coleslaw I've ever had. The finish, the carrot cake and pecan cake are to die for.  You won't regret it and it's not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Meilleur poulet a Montréal! Rien à voir avec les autres restaurants de poulet... le poulet est simplement délicieux en s'en lécher litérallement les doigts! Mon plat préféré le hot chicken viande blanche :) Il est certain que le menu n'est pas très élaboré mais vous trouverez les plats les plus populaires (cuisse, poitrine, hot chicken)."}
{"text":"Hi Guys its Johnny Mou your friendly old time Montrealer now on the West coast here In LA, I dream of the places I used to go to in Montreal and New York as the food industry out here is always  a turnover of styles and fashion . Whatever,,, ,anyways as an old time restauranteur I had a hankering for Chalet Bbq  recently as I used to go there regularily with my family growing up and later on with my ex girlfriends especially the Bells who loved this place . Their chicken is boom the best and better than St Huberts and its like an old style family place. I also used to know the ex chef Mr Zserbynsky as I knew his kids from amateur sports ,anyways later on circa 1980s me and some of the old professional eaters would go there and scoff on basically everything we can order from the limited menu ,we would freak out the lady servers because when your sitting there with Glen and Cliff and Mike D our check averages were like 3 times higher than the average guests ,good times great place,. Anyways I had a hankering for this place and when I do come back to the city 1 day Im going there eveyday,so there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was vintage, wait staff were efficient and personable, chicken and chips the best I've ever had. And the GRAVY!!!  OMG. I need to know what spices they put into it!!!"}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'une institution, n'ayons pas peur des mots! Même décor depuis toujours, même bon poulet et pratiquement les mêmes prix!! Mes parents m'ont fait découvrir ce lieu culte (qui n'a absolument rien à voir avec St-Hubert), j'en ai fait de même avec mes enfants. Ça vaut le détour c'est évident! Je me demande même si ce sont encore les mêmes serveuses d'antan qui y travaillent tellement le temps, dans ce resto, semble s'y être arrêté, il y a bien longtemps! :-)"}
{"text":"This place was voted the best bbq.chicken resto. In Montreal I wanted to see what the best was.If this is the best I wonder what the worst would be like It's not even close. The chicken was dry hard to chew,fries tastless and stale,hard to tell what was in the sauce Total disaster not worth it,"}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was born. It looks the same, smells the same and the food tastes like it has for over 60 years. I had to go back and relive my childhood, when my parents took me at least once a week. Now I live in California, but when I come to Montreal, it's for smoked meat, Chinese food and Chalet BBQ chicken. The formula must be the same, with fries, coleslaw, hot chicken sauce, and, of course, their famous Boston cream pie. Other wannabes like St. Hubert, Swiss Chalet, etc., don't compare. It's like going back in time and is one of the few Montreal originals, sigh....,  still left."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best restaurant in Montreal for rotisserie chicken! The chicken is so tasty, juicy and tender, and their fries are amazing. While the decor is out-dated, you go to this place for the food, not the ambience. After trying their chicken, I'm certain that you will never want to go to St-Hubert's ever again."}
{"text":"My go-to when ordering BBQ chicken. The sauce & fries combo is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town (NDG)area if you love old made bbq taste, you will love this chiken."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place for almost my whole life with my parents and I always took the same thing CHICKEN WINGS! They are so good! So then I went one day with my boyfreind and he forced me to try the chicken..  and so I did and I was hooked! Now I take the chicken wings for appetizers lol , the waitreses are so nice and old school. Its super cheap sometimes we double check to maje sure they didnt make a mistake! Its awesome."}
{"text":"The chicken and sauce at this place are the best in Montreal, without question, and the fries are among the best as well.  The chicken is never dry, the sauce has just the right bite.  The desserts are decent (I really like their pecan pie, warmed, and a la mode), and their coffee is the old style syrup based coffee - mayve not a great coffee, but somehow works very well with their desserts.  The service is usually good, diner-like, and quick.  Definitely one of my go-to places"}
{"text":"Best chicken I'm the city. Been here many times and always happy with it. Take out Isn't as good as eating in and taking in the experience. The waitresses have all worked here for 40+ years and have a perfect amount of sass.   If you've never been you have to go."}
{"text":"You can always expect consistently delicious food  It wasn't the first time coming here, and I have to say that every time I go to Chalet BBQ the food taste amazing, tastes fresh and looks really appetizing. The atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed most of the time, and it feels like walking into a wooden cabin where time stands still.  As such, the restaurant has managed to keep its old school charm and hasn't changed much over the decades.  Service is great and the staff members are super friendly, always smiling and willing to answer any questions. You can tell that the staff members really love their jobs. My waitress was incredibly nice, at one point we even started talking about her family, and I felt like I was getting to know the waitress on a somewhat more personal level. The best dish to order is the quarter chicken meal. It comes with a delicious quarter chicken breast or thigh, home-cut fries, unique gravy and amazing coleslaw. Their cooking process makes the chicken really tender and gives it a unique, smokey taste that is quite different than other rotisseries.  If you enjoy good food and want to meet nice people, this would be a great establishment to try. It's inexpensive and reasonably priced. A family of four could eat for 50$. Easily the best tasting chicken in Montreal and even their take away counter is surprisingly fast!"}
{"text":"Their chicken is juicy and their fries are good. Not as good as Romados but it's an ok place. The soup and bread are plain.  Service is friendly and parking can be a bit of a challenge on the weekends."}
{"text":"5 star bbq chicken. Deliciously wood-fired, slow-cooked ,tender and moist chicken roasted to perfection with an outstanding flavor. Unlike other large chain restaurants with mediocre quality, this place always offers the best. Small simple menu sticking to what it knows best since 1944. Everything to the sauce fries and coleslaw is done right. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"It has a 1980's feel to it, and based on the clientele there, it's an ideal spot for families with kids, and \"mature\" patrons, if you know what I mean. (Perhaps that has more to do with who lives around there in the NDG area, though).   But chicken was super delicious and had a great charred taste from the grill. I ordered the chicken and fries a la carte as another reviewer had recommended in order to get a larger pile of fries. (In contrast, my husband ordered the chicken combo meal which is a couple of bucks more but includes soup.) But when our food arrived, my husband had as large of a pile of fries as I did! Anyway, lesson learned. Next time I'll order the combo too because soup on a cold winter day sounds pretty good.   Maybe this is a duh comment, but don't order the Boston creme pie for dessert. It came out still a bit frozen where it likely has been stored for a quite awhile.   Great casual diner at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"If authentic BBQ chicken is what you crave then look no further; a truly unique Montreal experience that has been delighting diners since 1944 and has stood the test of time by focusing on customer satisfaction  I have had Chalet BBQ delivered and it was delicious but it is well worth your while to make the pilgrimage to the original chalet themed rotisserie for the friendly service, charming decor, and even yummier eats."}
{"text":"The absolute best rotisserie chicken in Montreal. French fries are to die for. Coleslaw is amazing. Leg, breast, wings - all so juicy and flavorful. Don't forget the Hot Chicken sandwich, either. A Montreal landmark."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here for the first time while in Montreal.  It gave me a very strong Swiss Chalet vibe which is not a bad thing in my eyes. Overall, it was delicious and the prices were amazing! It was also quite speedy for delivery!"}
{"text":"Good place for regular chicken and fries. Cute, retro, tasty.  Would go back once a year"}
{"text":"another Montreal institution. been in the same spot for almost 80 years -  best rotisserie chicken, fries, gravy period! Just Go!"}
{"text":"Best chicken in Montreal!!! Million times better then St Hubert or Cote St Luc BBQ. I'm there every week."}
{"text":"It was 10:30 pm, I was hungry and wasn't sure what I wanted to eat, I ran through my options as I was driving home but not many places were open. I passed by Chalet BBQ and decided to try it. I have heard people refer to it as the best rotisserie chicken in Montreal but I honestly had my doubts about that statement but what the hell, I'd never been there before.  My first impression after walking in was , \"I've stepped into a time warp\" the decor was straight out of the 70's...  I was greeted by someone at the counter and I ordered a 1/4 chicken breast/wing combo which comes with your standard BBQ sauce and fries. I added a coleslaw, paid for my order and left with a big brown bag in my hand about 5 minutes later.  I got home and quickly dug in, the fries were extremely limp and greasy, not a good first impression. I dipped then into the BBQ sauce, it was on the sweet side and didn't really improve things. Onto the chicken, the skin was very crispy and on the salty side and the chicken, very very dry, not the tender,  moist chicken I was anticipating. The coleslaw was the typical vinegar based kind, nothing special.  I really wanted to like it, it's close to home and it would have been a nice addition to my regular spots but sadly, that is not the case.  In a nutshell, overrated ...St Hubert is better then this, Cotsco Rotisserie chicken is better then this. Sorry not a fan..."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken in North America, period. I have gotten the same thing since I was able to chew my own food - a half with fries and vinegar cole slaw, dump the gravy on the fries, Pepsi without ice. Peerless."}
{"text":"You never really appreciate how good Chalet is until you come back and realize that the sauce is tasty and thick. The meat comes off the bone so easily. And the fries haven't been sitting there, they are fresh and hot and tasty.   Okay, maybe our particular server was lazy, but they work as a team and everyone else served us quickly and well. The decor probably hasn't changed since they opened. And thankfully neither has the food. This is place to come back to, just to remember how good rotisserie chicken can be and how the chains aren't."}
{"text":"during the summer I got at least every other week, during the winter at least once a month. Their high standards are well-maintained and I & mom continue to enjoy dining here, we always get good value."}
{"text":"Always a nice place to go to.   The people are nice and the chicken moist and flavorful. But beware, that's all that is on the menu. Chicken... I think I saw a little bit of salad on there but I might have hallucinated it. But that's ok, when I go there, I got chicken on my mind and nothing can stop me from eating some :)"}
{"text":"They simply do barbeque chicken the way it should be done, and most people I know who have commented agree the price is more than fair. Service is also incredibly fast in my experience, despite their often being large crowds. They are clearly honed in the trade of servicing a lot of people quickly and seamlessly. If all that doesn't impress you, well that's really all it is. In essence it is not that different from any bbq chicken joint. As a long time NDGer it will always have a special place in my diet."}
{"text":"Classic BBQ chicken joint open since 1944. Best part is they haven't touched their menu or decor since. Great for family dinners, chicken soup when you're sick, or even just a cup of coffee and a slice of pie. The vintage booths make it all the better. I recommend a quarter chicken meal with a hot bun and fries. You might need an extra gravy if you're smart. There should be no frie left dry. Another tip, ask for some chicken necks. They're salty, delicious, and free. A little tip from my grandfather."}
{"text":"What I wouldn't give to be able to walk in here and order their chicken...it's been about 10 years since I've had that opportunity...I used to fly over here as a kid after picking up comics at Captain Quebec...amazing chicken, amazing fries...great dipping sauce...while they have similar fare to some other bbq joints in Montreal, I still find that there chicken was always superior. If they would freeze and ship to California, I would order!"}
{"text":"Our first find on yelp in Montreal.  THANK YOU YELP. Chicken with everything and more of what I read on ratings. Fresh slaw, killer chicken and whoever is reading this . . . get the fries - its worth every calorie!"}
{"text":"Great no nonsense, old fashioned chicken dinner like you mother would have made!  Great chicken soup and the coleslaw was excellent.    Nice to find a family friendly restaurant in this area that won't break the bank.  Seat yourself and get ready to chow down"}
{"text":"Oui! Oui e Oui!   As a big fan of Swiss Chalet, I couldn't wait to try this place. During my last day in Montreal, a good friend of ours wanted to take my boyfriend and I out, and with all the choices, I chose Chalet Bar-B-Q.   The interior of the restaurant is so charming - dark, woodsy - yeah, like a Swiss Chalet. The waitresses here are even more charming; elder ladies who probably have worked here since the beginning. Our friend indicated that he went here as a young child (and he is an older man) so this place is still going strong.  Food. Chicken. Fries (yummmmmmmmmmmmm). Coleslaw. Can't go wrong. And the food is very yummy. I added a full glass of red wine that cost me $2!!!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Swiss Chalet, and is craving for some delightful poulet e frites. It's got such a chill and low-key vibe as well - and that heavenly scent of chicken...  A HUGE FAN!"}
{"text":"Nous l'avons essayé pour une première fois. Je n'avais jamais entendu parlé, mais j'ai eu le temps de lire les avis qui étaient pour la plupart très positifs. J'ai pris un repas de demi-poulet.  La sauce était très bonne, mais goûtait un peu trop une épice (cardamome ou clou de girofle). L'extérieur du poulet était croustillant, mais c'est vrai que la viande est un peu sèche. En la mélangeant avec la sauce, c'est parfait. Les frites sont croustillantes et rappellent ceux du Lafleur.   Vraiment pas cher. La tarte à la noix de coco est délicieuse. Les serveuses sont sympathiques et très rapides.   Peut-être pas meilleur que le romados, mais différent."}
{"text":"a big hi to all the guest & montreal. my wife and i have bin going to the (chalet bar-b-q) since i was just a boy of age five. and my mom's mom came here as well. we are so grateful to all the staff that work at this great place. and the chicken & fries & sauce have never changed. we wish you all many more years of great chicken. your grateful. customers. danny & elaine..."}
{"text":"Perfect Ma and Pop comfort food!!! Best chicken we have had in a very long time!!! Service was amazing, Helen treated us like gold and we had a lot of fun with her. Wish I could give this place 10 stars. The only problem here was the food was soooo good that we overate way too much!!! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best chicken in montreal hands down, I don't live in Montreal anymore but whenever I'm back in town I always find time for a meal here, the handcut fries, coleslaw, chicken, everything here is to die for"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for awhile, and since it's near our therapist, we figured it would be a good place to decompress lol. At first glance, we were a little hesitant, because it didn't look like there were many customers and the interior looked like it was trapped in the 1950s. But we went for it, and we're glad we did. We both ordered chicken leg combos from the kind server, which came with fries, Cole slaw, bread, and gravy. Being that we had been at St Hubert a few weeks prior (I thought it was just ok), this would be a good comparison. The verdict? I'd say that all the basics were slightly better, but the gravy put it over the top. I think there was cinnamon in there? Well whatever it was, we couldn't get enough of it. Hopefully we'll have an appetite after our next therapy appointment so we can come back :)"}
{"text":"Still pretty good but I've been consistently disappointed with their fries for the past year or so. What happened? New supplier? They're just not as good as they used to be :("}
{"text":"Coming here more than 40 years.  Excellent bbq chicken.  No nonsense, great value, always well cooked flavourful chicken.  Fries n baked always good.  Not fancy. Quick pleasant service.  Heck, what more do you want from $10 - $15 meal."}
{"text":"I returned here with a big group of friends (10 of us) on a Wednesday night. It was better than I remembered. I can't say I'd had a bad experience before, it just hadn't made that much of an impression on me.  The decor is kitschy, with a vague Swiss Chalet feel around a classic, no-frills diner with booths and some tables.  Our waitress was brilliant, really making an effort to accommodate us by moving tables. She misunderstood an order, but it was no problem. She was cheerful and efficient at all times. In fact, she gets my vote for \"Best Server I've Had Occasion To Meet This Year\". Her name is Laura. She even told us a very funny joke while we were paying our bills.  I had a chicken leg dinner (with fries and cole slaw, a toasted roll and the famous sauce), and it was really good. I washed it down with a bottle of Labatt Blue. (They have Molson Ex on tap.) The chicken beats St Hubert by miles. It is juicy and perfectly cooked, and the fries are soft and slightly sweet. Apparently they're prepared with a 5-step process that includes lots of soaking in water. The cole slaw is crunchy and not too sweet, and you get a big bowl of it instead of a tiny little cup. Personally, I don't like the sauce. It's supposed to be barbecue, but it has a heavy dose of cinnamon in it.  At $21, including tax and tip, this is very reasonable, and really worthwhile."}
{"text":"St hubert is a shame compared this chicken joint!  Even tho they have been around since 1940's not much as changed. I've seen pictures of the old school menu vs 2017 and it's still the same juicy tender chicken and delicious greasy little fries made with love.   The gravy is tasty reminds me of home cooking on Xmas made from the drippings. It's very good and wasn't lumpy and chunky like a corner chicken restaurant.  If I had to pick one chicken spot and the rest would vanish then good bye st hubert and scores ,I'll take chalet over you guys any day."}
{"text":"Pretty good traditional chicken rotisserie place, much better then any of the chains I will not mention lol if you want some real chicken with amazing fries on the side you have to try it (not as good as Portuguese chicken though sorry!!!!)"}
{"text":"When this expat come back to Montreal this is one of the eateries on my must list! A simple menu done to perfection! By far the best Bar B-Q chicken in town! The service is quick and pleasant. This visit I had the hot chicken sandwich with fries and a side of coleslaw... Comfort food at its best! Foodies visiting Montreal, you have to add Chalet Bar B-Q to your list!"}
{"text":"A fantastic neighborhood place with amazing chicken and potatoes, which is really all they serve because they do it so well. Unassuming decor but the staff are lovely and the wine is good and cheap. Loved it! Ola was lovely to meet and made us feel very welcome!"}
{"text":"i felt like i was taken back in time. old school! good food. fast service. fries are excellent."}
{"text":"I don't get why everyone raves about this place. The chicken was ok. It had a little something different, but nothing that will make me come back. The gravy is quite salty and we all detected a hint of nutmeg in it which was odd. The fries are very good and fried in peanut oil. A few in the group wanted a club sandwich, but it's not on the menu. (First time I see a chicken joint not have club sandwich on the menu!) Besides Cesar salad there are no veggie options. The water glasses are practically the size of a shot glass. With all that salt better ask for a pitcher of water. We were all dehydrated after our meal."}
{"text":"Can I give ten stars? No? ONLY 5? Outrageous. I would give them 100 if I could.  I have been coming here for probably 30 years. Nothing has changed, and I hope it never does. The best barbecue chicken in the city, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Fries are incredible. The cole slaw is wicked. And that bbw sauce! I'm a fan of the regular sauce but you can also ask for \"wing\" sauce instead if you like that tangy stuff better. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to give this place a 5* rating. Not because it's particularly pretty or because it was the best meal of my life, but because from the second we walked in, all staff members were so caring and sweet - it's just so rare to get AMAZING customer service in Montreal!   When they found out it was our first time visiting, our waitress was extra helpful and sweet. That's what'll make the difference the next time I'm craving chicken and not sure where to eat... Chalet will be on the top of my list for sure!!  They serve comforting, Quebecois-style rotisserie chicken with delicious fries that have a hint on vanilla in them, served with their BBQ sauce, a piece of white bread and coleslaw (not creamy, the vinegary type). I personally don't see the need for the bread but the chicken, sauce, fries and coleslaw all had great flavours.   Such a cozy vibe inside the restaurant as it's been around since the 1940s. The guys at work order from this place every couple of weeks so maybe I'll join them next time :P"}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Montreal as I already arrived late and this was the only interesting restaurant which was walking distance to where I'm staying. I didn't have any expectations as I think it's just chicken and fries. I got the chicken leg dinner which came with chicken soup and fries. It was a cold night so the soup did a good job giving me extra warmth. I thought the color was a bit funky but it tasted good. There were a lot of chicken chucks included.   As for the chicken, I really liked it. It came with gravy like sauce but I didn't really like the taste of it and I think the chicken itself was already so flavorful. Also, the fries was so crispy and so good."}
{"text":"Very nice family-style restaurant with superb chicken.  It's been around for ages and will continue to be a favorite, because they know their audience and are institution in the community.  The chicken is perfectly cooked and the fries are hot, but what really stands out is the sauce.  What does it go on?  Everything!  It really is worth going out of your way to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever!  I take out and sit down in the restaurant.  Mind you, the restaurant is quite dated if you sit down inside, but it's part of the atmosphere!  My favourite BBQ chicken by far, in any City I've been to.  This hails over St Hub in my opinion...anybody know Swiss Chalet?  It's similar only better.  They are very efficient in their take out area too, go in the back door for takeout."}
{"text":"The Chalet BBQ Restaurant located at 5456 Sherbrooke Street West in NDG is a long-standing rotisserie in Montreal. They have been in business since 1944 and at the same location for as long as I can remember. I do recall a second location located on Decarie Boulevard, but it has long since closed.   The dining room decor consists of rustic wood panelling with red leather cushioned booths that can seat any group or number of people.  They also offer a very brisk take-out and delivery service located in the rear of the restaurant. Additionally, they rent rooms and cater parties, team sporting event banquets and wedding receptions. I have attended many a wedding reception and banquet here over the years.  If you like rotisserie style chicken there is no better place in Montreal. The leg or breast meals are served with either baked potato or French fries, BBQ sauce, a toasted bun and a choice of either coleslaw or tomato juice. They also serve great desserts such as Boston cream pie and apple pie. What is truly delightful about Chalet BBQ is you always get what you came for, excellent rotisserie chicken, excellent fries and a BBQ sauce that is drinkable. In fact, I recall as a young boy my friends and I would go on extremely cold winter days just to buy the BBQ sauce and drink it like a hot beverage! I usually have the leg dinner special and always get out for under $20, tip included.   Finally, It's worth a visit just to see some of the waitresses juggle up to three plates on their arms as they navigate the restaurant serving their meals. I have yet to see one of them lose a plate. Some have been here as long as I have been frequenting this restaurant which has been for over four decades now. God bless them, I don't know how they do it but they always have a smile on their faces and a nice word when I visit. Great customer service and a veritable Montreal landmark!"}
{"text":"After experiencing a strange craving for roast chicken that could be akin to The Hound's (aka Sandor Clegane from Game of Thrones), I decided to check out this place. Trying to shake off the fact that I was the only non-white person in the room (and alone, for that matter), I tried to keep an open mind, especially when the food is the always the main focus.  The waitress was really nice and made sure to help me familiarize with the menu before ordering, and I got the one leg dinner which came with fries, gravy, a bread roll/hamburger bun-type thing, and a choice of either coleslaw or chicken soup. Surprisingly, they get their food out really quickly, but everything still tasted freshly-made. The coleslaw was crisp and wasn't soaked in dressing, which I find is all too typical with how Americans make theirs. The roast chicken leg was pretty big and perfectly roasted, juicy, and had a crispy and flavorful skin. I didn't find the bread or fries to be all that unique, but then again, you can't expect a place that seems really tied in with tradition to pull out all the stops on staples like those. The gravy was also obviously made with drippings from the roast meat and not from a box, so props to them for doing that.  Overall, Chalet B-B-Q is a good place if you're looking for some nice comfort food and if a rotisserie chicken from your local Metro won't cut it. I paid $10.95 total for everything, so if you need to save money then this is also an ideal location for serving that purpose."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best chicken I've ever had in my life..  Cooked over maple hardwood, and you can seriously taste the smoke in the bird  Fries are amazing.  Fresh cut, multi fried in peanut oil  Chalet sauce is like Swiss Chalet sauce done right.  It's amazing  For $26.95 we got a whole chicken, a giant family bag of fries, 2 chalet sauces and 4 buns.    And I dunno if it was a mistake or what, but we had a third set of thigh and leg thrown in for free  If you're from Ontario, like me, and used to nothing but Portuguese chicken and Swiss chalet then you gotta try this place"}
{"text":"The Yelpers are right and so is my uncle... Chalet is some awesome montreal chicken.  The gravy is fantastic and so are the fries.  I even ate coleslaw, and I don't even like coleslaw!  5 stars for a meal under $10!"}
{"text":"Great 60s atmosphere, good food at really cheap prices. If chicken is what you want then this is the place for you. I don't remember any non chicken foods though."}
{"text":"Un des trésors de Montréal. Ce restaurant anonyme par son emplacement directement aux croisements de l'autoroute Décarie et de la rue Sherbrooke Ouest. C'était le resto préféré de mes grands-parents. Le décor (et les serveuses) date des années soixante. Ne vous découragez pas par ce fait, c'est probablement le meilleur poulet sur broche en ville. Ici, ils ne servent que du poulet.  Je vous recommande la livraison où pour apporter. Un petit secret, lorsque vous passez votre commande indiquez que vous voulez un quart de poulet (cuisse ou poitrine), une sauce et une frite. Ne prenez pas l'option repas. De cette façon, vous avez, plus de sauce et de frittes pour quelques sous de différences.  J'oubliai! La sauce, la plus incroyable!!! Que vous soyez de type sauce ou non, cette sauce est vraiment Mmmmmm!!!! Miam! Miam!"}
{"text":"Womp womp. The first time you serve me an ultra small portion of protein and no utensils I'll call you and let you know that that doesn't fly. I won't be angry with you, but I'll be honest that you'll see people slowly trying out other rotisseries like the one Down the street that charges 30% less. But now for a second time in a row I find myself sitting on my bed with an unacceptably small portion of protein and no take out set of utensils, napkin and salt/pepper and I've essentially paid $10 for a big order of fries. It's really too bad because I really liked chalet BBQ and even though it's on my block I'll now be taking the 10 minute walk to the other rotisserie. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've ever had. Although this is NOT barbecue. They do serve this rotisserie-style chicken with a side of sauce they call bar-b-q. This is not traditional American barbecue sauce. The service is no-nonsense. Nuttin' fancy, but if what you are looking for is good chicken then this is the place. So tender,  juicy and flavorful.  Excellent chicken noodle soup too."}
{"text":"SOOOOO good. This aint no overpriced, underwhelming St-Hubert type rotisserie.  This place is just hilarious--you feel like you're travelling back to another era. The waitresses are all mature women so you get that homey feel like your grandma is bringing your food to you. The lighting is dim and it has a diner appeal with the bunks, but with a ~chalet twist~ of wood walls and après-ski knick-knacks.   First off, the prices are great for what you get. 8.95 thigh special which is a generous portion of roast chicken with tons of fries, small side of coleslaw, a bun and a drink! Can't beat that. The chicken is so tender and never dry, the skin crispy and melt in your mouth. The fries are the kinds of fries I personally love: average thickness where some are crispy, some are soft and they taste like real Quebec casse-croute fries.   You do feel bloated after eating here so I try to limit myself but if you're around the area definitely go! It's iconic."}
{"text":"For a proper chalet chicken dinner, this is it for Montréal. Although it's nestled in the NDG neighbourhood, it's easy to reach by car and definitely worth a visit.   The 2 leg and half-chicken meals we got were tender and without fault, tasted homemade and traditional. With each meal comes a choice of fries, chicken soup or creamy coleslaw. The chicken soup is good for cold days, especially because it's full of half-shell pastas, but I loved the vinegar-based coleslaw. It was a refreshing accompaniment to the sloppy, juicy, herby chicken. If the chicken hadn't been so filling, I may have gotten another full order to go.  What really blew me away was the sauce, as it was fragrant and full of what I interpreted to be herbs, but really I can't say. A real je ne sais quoi about it. When we bugged the waitress for the secret to the sauce, she just came back with two extra containers and a coy look on her face as if she knew we'd devour it even if we didn't know how it was made.   The take-out line grew and reduced like a stop-motion film - a testament to the speed of their service. The space is open, warm (brick oven in the back) and comfortable enough for you to pass out in an apres-poulet coma, which is exactly what we did. Be prepared for the meal by starving yourself a little beforehand, otherwise you won't have any room for dessert. Your starving wallet will also thank you, as this is easily the most economical place for dinner aside from buffets."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this place.  Moist juicy chicken, terrific sauce (get extra right off the bat, you will need it cause it's that good), good coleslaw and great fries.  Been going there for several decades and it's still as good as the first time.  To top it off, they have free parking in back.  Don't wait, go get stuffed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ rotisserie chicken in the city.  When it comes to the chicken, this is not a Portuguese rotisserie or some fancy restaurant, instead it's similar to a famous Quebec rotisserie chicken chain... but so much better! The old style decor as well as the no frills menu is an hommage to their 1944 roots. Staff is friendly and will make sure you have a great meal.  (Ask for Nella) What a great place to enjoy Montreal's best chicken!"}
{"text":"The iconic Chalet Bar-B-Q is still wonderful.  My grandparents first brought me here in the early 1970s and it still looks, feels, and tastes as good as it has always been. Yes, the staff has changed as time has passed but it it still the Chalet Bar-B-Q that I remember as a child. Montreal has its truly spacial places and in my book this is one of them. Yes, the menu is simple -- but that's part of the beauty of the place.   I don't get to Montreal that often at the moment but whenever I am there I always make a point of having a meal here. Always!"}
{"text":"As everyone else has stated...This is the BEST Chicken, BBQ sauce and French Fries anywhere. Charming wood-panelled interior, warm and cosy. Fast service. Reasonably priced.  And for you out-of-towners, notice how happy everyone sounds! I do not recommend ordering take-out. (dry chicken limp and greasy fries). It must be consumed on the spot. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed!  ENJOY."}
{"text":"I just want to update my review to knock off a start for one reason. This does not affect my last 4 star reviews. They both stand and are true. But I have a semi complaint about one dish.  I ordered the chicken sandwich one night last week. Since everything was so good, I imagined it was sliced chicken in a nice piece of bread with the lettuce or something. When it arrived, it was just sliced chicken, on its own, between two terrible white squares. When you held it, it just mushed into your hand, and was really disappointing. It just took away from the chicken. So I took all the chicken out and threw out the bread.  Considering how everything here is so tasty and good and down to a T, this is a note more to the restaurant that they should invest in getting some better bread with some garnishes for the \"sandwich.\""}
{"text":"What to say about Chalet Bar-B-Q? It's an old school, very old school chicken joint. Really damn good chicken, really damn good French fries, really damn good cole slaw and damn that Boston cream pie is amazing and they have a pretty big delivery territory which is fine for me. Why order from them? Because it beats all the chicken delivery chains like St-Hubert and others."}
{"text":"If what you crave is Rotisserie chicken then let me tell you, there is no better place then Chalet Bar-B-Q. Trust me, it takes a lot for me to rate something five stars on Yelp, but this place easily earns the distinction. i've been frequenting Chalet Bar-B-Q since i was a kid, my dad has gone here since he was a young boy, and my grand father went here when it first opened back when, so talk about returning loyal customers. It's also not a franchise, despite many offers over the years, meaning there's only 1 location! The interior of the place is honestly nothing special except for the fact that it hasn't changed much since it opened. Wood-like paneling lines the walls of this diner joint. Funny enough, some of the waitresses still remember me from when I was a little kid. The quarter leg or quarter breast lunch special is really what you want to order off the menu. It comes with your choice of coleslaw or tomato juice. Honest to god, best coleslaw I've ever had anywhere. Then comes the best piece of rotisserie chicken you'll find in a restaurant with a side of their delicious golden fries, a toasted hamburger bun and a gravy that will leave you asking for more. Once you eat here, you'll understand the difference between quality comfort food, and generic mediocre food that you get at St-Hubbert. If you happen to still have room for dessert, I'd recommend the Boston Cream pie, honestly who even serves that in a restaurant in Montreal? The prices are cheap and fair, and be warned that the service is EXCEPTIONALLY quick, that much always stuck with me throughout the years. So if you're from Montreal and have never been or just visiting, find some time and stop by Chalet Bar-B-Q, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The best rotisserie chicken in the city. The \"real\" NDG Town Hall. 70+ years of doing one thing, and doing it right. I have my birthday dinner there every year in the \"Chicken Champagne Room\" as I call it. The food is consistently good, the chicken moist, the fries tasty. My favourite restaurant in the city. If you are from here, and you haven't been, there's something wrong with you."}
{"text":"I have ordered only delivery from this restaurant, but the quality of the chicken is definitely the best among Cote-St-Luc and St-Hubert BBQs. The fries are the \"soft\" soggy kind which are dark but still taste pretty good."}
{"text":"If you like chicken...go here...period... the best ever... and inexpensive for Montreal...more food than we could eat for 25 total...salad/soup 1/4 breast and plate full of fries.. yum yum!  Open since 1944 and nothing has changed in this \"quaint\" place...which is nice in this day and age of constant change."}
{"text":"What's the deal ? What's so exciting about this place? Oh my god, just the chicken itself, super moist, perfectly cooked, OK Seasoning. The price! Yeah is very decent. It's pretty much like a home St-Hubert. Like Lafleur home-super-greasy fries. Which is a real.It's kind of not a big deal, but we order from them on Chicken Friday at the Office, Greasy food increase the morale of the troops!   Cheap, Ok meal with load of grease! Nice classic"}
{"text":"This place is completely a knock off version of Swiss chalet and to make it all worst I found hairnin my chicken"}
{"text":"I don't understand why it is so difficult for people to be polite to people when you are requesting your services especially services you're paying for them. I requested food to be delivered to my hotel room and after multiple hold received a lot of attitude and then a statement which stated I would have to order $150 of food in order to get delivery. When I responded that the yelp allowed me to order the food,  continue to give me attitude and said if I place it online they would not deliver it... So that means you guys would take my money and not deliver food??? Never again and please work on the attitude"}
{"text":"I clearly do not have to review this resto because everyone already has summed it up, many different ways.  Chalet BBQ matches my \"Return-Worthy\" Criteria:  1) Good Service 2) Good Product/Food 3) Reasonably priced.  I've been here a gazillion times with my hubby. The ambiance is so cozy, and the waitresses are so sweet. The fries are absolutely amazing and so is the chicken. The small salad is also quite filling and worth the $2.95.  Definitely a gem to try in the NDG area (right @ Decarie / Sherbrook)!"}
{"text":"Roast My Soul At Chalet BBQ...  Prior to visiting the south, I would have called this the best BBQ chicken in Montreal. Now I know to call it the best rotisserie chicken in Montreal, don't believe those cote st-luc'ers.  And the gravy at Chalet may induce seizures from taste overload...be forewarned,aye, here's the rub, the coleslaw along with the chicken noodle soup, are f#cking' fantastic.  wakawwaka"}
{"text":"Sans contester le meilleur poulet BBQ au monde et je n'exagère pas une miette!!! Je fréquente ce restaurant depuis facilement 25 ans et il n'a pas changé du tout! Ouvert en 1944, la déco n'a probablement jamais été refait ni même que les charmantes petites serveuses!!! Vielles banquettes brunes, mur en  lambris de bois, bref l'établissement porte bien son nom!!!  Le poulet est cuit dans des fours de briques au charbon de bois ce qui est plutôt rare de nos jours! Cela lui donne un goût fumé propre à lui et la chaire reste très juteuse....un délice!!! Le menu spécial du midi ( jamais été le soir) est composé d'un choix de repas cuisse/poitrine ou du hot chicken. Le tout vient accompagné d'une salade de choux ou jus de tomate, sauce, pain, boisson fontaine et le choix entre frites ou patate au four pour un total de 10$ environ! St-Hubert, Benny et autres n'arrivent pas à la cheville du chalet!  À essayer ou réessayer au plus vite!!!"}
{"text":"Best Rotisserie chicken in North America....as a little baby, I lived on the street next to the Chalet so it must be in my DNA....every time I visit Montreal, I am drawn to the Chalet like iron filings to a magnet....do not miss it."}
{"text":"All this place has is the Best Rotisserie Chicken EVER!    French Montrealers will tell you St.Hubert has the best chicken and less sophisticated English Montrealers will tell you its Cote-St-Luc BBQ - but don't believe them, this is North Americas best.  Part of the beauty is the simplicity of the menu, which is pretty much Chicken, potato and slaw. The chicken has a delectable crunchy seasoned skin covering the juicey meat.  The sauce/gravy is so good I've often thought about drinking it straight, so be sure to order extra gravy, you'll want to lap it up with the roll towards the end of the meal followed by the wing for desert. This wing is so crispy you can eat the bones."}
{"text":"Despite the misleading 'BBQ', the interior of the restaurant really looked like a chalet. The rotisserie chicken was tender, juicy and well seasoned (with salt).  The sauce, however, tasted cinnamon above anything else, which I didn't really enjoy...  The bread was nicely toasted (unlike St-Hubert's), the homemade fries were fluffy, but not crispy (still good).   The chicken noodle soup tasted like lipton's (very salty, and not tasting very chicken).  Service was friendly, quick, and efficient.  The overall experience lifted our mood from not winning a hackathon to satisfied with life.  1star was deducted for the sauce."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken, fries, gravy and soup. St-Hubert or Swiss Chalet don't hold a candle to this place. Service is brisk but friendly.  My only gripe is that for $2 per small glass of fountain soda, a refill ought to be included. It would cost them literally pennies."}
{"text":"WHEN I start eating chicken again, the first place I eat it will be at Chalet Bar B-Q. Swiss Chalet and St-Hubert roast up a poor man's rotisserie chicken in comparison.  I used to live about ten doors down from CBBQ and some weeks I'd eat here NIGHTLY, and that was as a one-step-from-hobodom McGill student. The quarter chicken dinner is something like $2 or $3 cheaper than at Swiss Chalet and the chalet sauce yields the perfect penetration for fry and chicken dipping.  The servers, quintessentially Quebecois, are your typical burgundy & spiked haired, poorly aging (sunscreen, people!!) older ladies and may have been working here since the place opened in 1944. They may or may not speak English but you know what you're getting from the moment you walk in the door so what does it matter. Decor is nothing to get excited about - it's outdated and musty and you may actually forget it's the 21st century as you mow down on roasted chicken.  Like Swiss Chalet they have a separate takeaway counter. Worth the drive to Montreal!"}
{"text":"By far the best rotisserie chicken you will ever have, plus fast and friendly service. You'll never want St-Hubert or Swiss Chalet ever again. Their delivery is usually very quick if you live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"By far the BEST!!! BBQ chicken you'll ever have. Chalet Bar-B-Q has been a Montreal staple since 1944 and they sure have mastered the art of BBQ chicken, whether dining in or taking out this place is a cut above the rest never to be put in the same category as such garbage as St. Hubert or Swiss Chalet and in my opinion (and this is a big Montreal debate) much better than Côte St-Luc Bar-B-Q. I only get one meal when I come here and although I'm sure they serve other things I have yet to ever look at the menu, for me its all about the double leg dinner with fries and a coleslaw. Pure heaven. My mouth is watering just thinking about it and I just finished eating it."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband took me here when we first started dating and it was a chicken revelation to me!!! I grew up with Swiss Chalet (until they close). My husband on the other hand, grew up with Chalet B.B.Q. He lived from walking distance in NDG. Ever since then, we I would crave some rotisserie chicken this is the place we would go to. My husband always take the quarter leg meal. It comes with coleslaw or chicken soup. Fries or baked potatoes with sour cream. The chicken and loads of gravy! Pure delight! As for me, i would go for the hot chicken. The best classic hot chicken in town. It comes with fries or baked potato, green peas and gravy over it. A lot of gravy. So much that you could eat it with a spoon.   This place has been opened since 1944 and from what we know, nothing has changed much. Most of the waitresses has been here since... Well forever! They are so, so, SO nice. It feels like your eating at your favourite auntie's house! Service is fast and excellent. Food is comforting and yummy for the belly and soul!"}
{"text":"Really ordinary. Good price for lunch. Old style decoration... Really fast service and parking available but not yummy at all for me."}
{"text":"Fait plusieurs fois que je vais au chalet bbq jamais était déçus que ça sois du service ou de la nourritures toujours parfait   Je prend toujours mon fameux 2 cuisses de poulet avec Frites et salade chou pis un Pepsi  Ses toujours gagnant :)   J'ai essayer la gare au coconut WoW a tombé par terre ;) tellement que ses bon   Le décor et chaleureux style cabanes une grand salle à dîner les chaises sont confortable"}
