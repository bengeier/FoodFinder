{"text":"They make a gluten-free version of their salt and pepper squid for me using cornstarch and cook it in separate oil to prevent cross-contamination because I have Celiac Disease.  Yum!  Hot, fresh and never greasy.  Hubby loves their Ginger Fried Shredded Chicken (hot) and we love the freshness of the Snow Pea and Broccoli in Garlic Sauce or in Ginger Onion Sauce.  Chicken & Mixed Vegetables, Vegetable Chop Suey to round out the veggie side of things and we are all set. I think all their food is MSG free as well.  If in doubt, just request whatever you need. They are friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Our new, favourite, walking-distance asian food spot.  The walk is a bit longer for us, but the quality of food is worth it.    Like many of this style, westernized-asian restaurant, the menu is large and spans many culinary traditions.  Chow Mien, Egg Foo Yung, and Fried Rice dishes are on the menu, as is Tom Yum soup.  Surroundings are not special -- simple, clean, 80's top 40 on the radio.  None of this bodes well, in my mind, but the service was very friendly and accommodating, and the dishes we ordered were superior to what we usually get at similar restaurants in the region.    They were happy to create something off-menu for us -- vegetables and tofu in black bean sauce.  The veggies were plentiful, fresh, and cooked just right.  The sauce was delicious, with just the right (modest) amount of zing for us.  We got veggie Egg Foo Yung on a whim (first time since the 70's, I think) and was surprised to find it a very tasty dish, again with plenty of fresh vegetables.    Minor downside (other than the plain atmosphere):  take out containers are styrene -- about as poor an environmental choice as one can make.  (If they shifted to paper or re-usable plastic containers we would probably get take-out here a lot.)  Easy solution:  Eat in and bring your own containers for leftovers."}
