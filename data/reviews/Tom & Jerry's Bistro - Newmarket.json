{"text":"This used to be the spot for half price wings during the week (Tuesday at this location). Many still frequent this place for its great fries but I've stopped because of its below average wings. They are small and dry and have limited flavors. Also the venue itself is getting a dated look. The service is good and the prices cheap. It has TVs for the sport fans and a pool table for recreation. Nothing special about the place but the fries and the rest is not bad by any means."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place with friendly staff and fresh food this is the place    some places I won't eat the salad because of cross contamination. 
I had the cesar salad with white anchovies  it was full of flavor and I didn't get sick !"}
{"text":"We have gone to Tom and Jerrys for the past 18 years for the wings. We were never disappointed. We went for the sunday special of $25 for a pitcher of beer, an appy and a small,order of wings this past Sunday. My husband had the greek salad with a chicken breast. My wings were terrible. I ordered the usual hot and they tasted like a BBQ tossed wing with heat. They were overcooked, dripping in this awful sauce and tasted burnt. My husbands salad was wilted and for $16 you would think it would have been fresher. I couldnt eat the wings so i sent them back. She said she would take it off the bill but instead of deducting the price of a small order of wings from the $25 special price, they charged us $17.99 for the jug of beer and $5 for the free appy. So at the end of the day, only $2 was taken from the bill. So unfair. I didnt say anything because the server was so sorry and we didnt want to make her feel bad so we paid our bill and left.
Very disappointed and we wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have been going to wing night for year at the Aurora, Newmarket and recently Keswick. Until recently the wings were great, juicy with lots of meat. The last couple of times at Newmarket and then the new franchise in Keswick I don't think the wing were large enough to have had feathers. 

Servers are all great and the fries super. Everything comes hot but the wings  are skimpy."}
{"text":"I have been to all the locations and the food quality is really good. The chicken wings and ribs are fantastic and the wedge fries with the dill dip is the best in town. 
Will be back often"}
{"text":"Lots of places claim to have \"The Galaxy's best wings\", \"Best wings in X\" etc.  However, Tom and Jerry's ACTUALLY has the best wings of any place i have ever been.  They do not have a lot of flavours, but it really doesn't matter, I would much prefer to have one phenomenal wing flavour than thirty mediocre ones like other more popular wing places.

Half price wing Wednesdays are busy, but if you are looking to drop $5 dollars on a pound of crispy, juicy, tender wings, then this is the place to be. 

The fries are also not to be ignored, they are super thick cut, crispy slabs of potatoie goodness.  They only issue is they don't have bottled Ketchup, you have to open like 4-5 of the tiny little Ketchup packets in order to get your tomato sauce fix. A minor issue, but i can overlook it. 

In conclusion, 
If you are looking to eat phenomenal food for a decent price. Go to Tom and Jerry's.

If you are looking for a pretty decor and nice shiny menu with 100's of mediocre options with fancy drinks and over-priced appetizers and attractive waiters/waitress' pretending to be nice so you will tip well. Go eat at some chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I went tom and Jerry's last night, and enjoyed it a lot. I had the au jus sandwich and it was ver tasty, the server was pleasent and it was a really nice place to eat, I'll be going back that's for sure, my girlfriend enjoyed her cheese burger too."}
{"text":"Not much to like.  Tucked away in the back of a small strip mall, Tom & Jerry's looks more like an afterthought.  I suspect management intended that, as indicated by the condition of the interior.  The red fabric seating is nearly black with embedded dirt, even though we have had steam cleaning in this country for decades.  The background music is \"70's Elevator\" and the smell of cigarette smoke somehow filters into  the dining area.

I ordered the Lemon Pepper wings, which is coincidental, since I had been to Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch and had the same thing (easier to compare the same dish).  The wings were not nearly as flavourful or crisp as BWW, and were accompanied by beefeater fries instead of veggies.

Overall, this would be a good choice for a nostalgic reminder of the diners you used to frequent before you developed taste."}
{"text":"We happened to be passing by Tom and Gerry's today when visiting a neighbouring store. First, the wonderful aroma wafting from the restaurant got our attention, then we noticed the half-priced wings sign which caused us to do an about-turn and head in. What a great place! Fun atmosphere, nice staff, and great wings, thick cut fries, addictive dill dipping sauce, and cold beer! How we could have missed this place before, I'll never know...but we'll be regulars."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, especially the wings and the dill sauce. Great atmosphere when watching a sports game. The service is usually very good and prompt as well. I always have to stop by when passing through Newmarket."}
{"text":"So I decided to go here based on the strength of some of the reviews. When wings get referred to as \"the greatest in the galaxy\" (actual availability of wings anywhere else in the galaxy notwithstanding) you set a pretty high bar. So you can understand that when I received my wings looking like they had been cooked in dragons fire I was a bit surprised. Daenerys may be great at conquering nations but she can't cook wings worth a s**t. Anyways. My initial disappointment aside, the place wasn't terrible. It wasn't good, but it wasn't completely horrible. The fries were good, the dip was nice. Kids had a burger and a pizza and it was standard bar fare. My oldest daughter ordered chicken fingers and didn't finish. Wife had beef dip. Again, passable. And I think that's the real problem. This is a bar. There were a number of people drinking at the bar. When you've got a daytime drinking crowd (we were there at 3), you're a bar. So if you want me to come eat here, you need to give me a compelling reason - and at this they fail fairly miserably.  The service was very good. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us regularly. If you're looking for a somewhat run down pub to have a drink and maybe a bite to eat, you could do worse. If you're just looking for a place to eat, you probably couldn't."}
