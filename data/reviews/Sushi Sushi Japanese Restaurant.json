{"text":"I made it to Sushi Sushi just in time to catch the lunch special, which runs until 3:00pm.  For sushi (there are noodle and teriyaki dishes as well), the special was a choice of a variety of rolls or sashimi, along with the standard Miso soup and salad.  The Miso soup was quite good (amazing that sushi places can do this badly) and the salad was basic and fresh, not a wilted piece of lettuce to be seen.  I ordered the Tuna special, and it was very good; fresh tasting and flavourful. The rolls and pieces were well built, and the rice was as good as I've seen. No crumbly, falling apart sushi here.  Seating is quite limited, and it's not fancy in anyway, which suits me perfectly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoy this restaurant. I take-out from here about 95% of the time and rarely dine in. They always have the food prepared within 10-15 minutes ready for pick-up.  Yesterday, I ordered from their lunch menu.  While the prices are reasonable, I had an issue with the way they transport their gyoza and spring rolls.  They place them in a styrofoam container, where the steam collects. Not only would this make them less than crispy, they add the sauce in the same container and let the dumplings sit to get soggy.    My dragon roll is always good. The avocado is always fresh, tempura shrimp is crispy, and the mayo is an amazing contrast in flavour. Plus, their rice is seasoned perfectly every time!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  Everything tasted so fresh and delicious.  The service was wonderful.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi restaurant I've found in Newmarket. It's my go-to place for Sushi take-out.  The place looks a bit small and unassuming, but it's nicely decorated, well lit and very well kept. It's not one of those places that focus on decorating and theme, but a place that focuses on the food, and one can definitely see that. Service is also very good and staff is always very friendly whenever I go there.  This restaurant focuses on the more basic and traditional sushi varieties. They have a large variety of sushi and do have some more exotic rolls, but it's the more traditional stuff that they do best. The sushi here is well made and very tasty. The rolls do not fall apart between your chopsticks like most other places in town. They also make good tempura and teriyaki, and a very good tasting miso soup.  Being a fan of sushi and having looked around quite a bit for a good sushi place, I can say this is the best I've found in the Town of Newmarket. I recommend this wholeheartedly for people looking for good quality and great tasting sushi."}
{"text":"Great space, good sushi!  This restaurant is a little difficult to find among the other strip mall businesses, but once you find it you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's well designed and spacious - a big plus in my books!   I was here with my family on a Tuesday, which, luckily for us, is $1.25/pc sushi! Couldn't turn down such an awesome offer and helped ourselves to salmon, special scallop, tamago, conch, and a few others. It's definitely worth it, and even more so at the special price! Salmon was ultra fresh, and same for the scallop.   Tempura was done very well, light and crispy and the shrimp was nice and tender though fully cooked. We also ordered the tempura pumpkin, which was nicely battered and wasn't greasy. The best part was that the dipping sauce was flavoured with some chopped ginger - nice touch!  I am also huge on service, so gave a four star review based on our lovely servers who were quick, friendly, and very attentive!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi place so far I've been too, besides not being buffet only ala cart menu. The price it's abit expensive and the rice to fish ratio in maki / sushi rolls were small considering the price your paying .  I won't be coming here again that's for sure."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a few friends, late afternoon on a Friday. We were told that we would only be able to order sushi, as there was only one employee there at the time. We decided to just go with it, as we were really only craving some rolls.   The man who served our food was very nice. In fact when we were ordering, he kindly informed us when he thought we ordered too many rolls, and at the end of our meal, we were all quite satisfied, so his input was appreciated.   Overall, the food was pretty good and the prices were quite reasonable as well. We will definitely be coming back to this restaurant for sushi in the future!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't the greatest, the waitress didn't ask how everything was, messed up our orders & the bills and the sushi was dry and not very flavourful. It wasn't busy but it took a very long time to receive our food.  They also didn't have a lot of the sushi things I usually order at any other sushi restaurant but oh well. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Come here if you want some awesome sushi in Newmarket.. particularity Salmon. Unfortunately, its costly, and there is no all you can eat - which would explain why the sushi is so good and fresh. Sashimi is like a tiny steak, melts like butter. I normally get spicy crispy salmon hand rolls and yam rolls.  Staff is quiet but pleasant. Its nice to sit in."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I discovered this place so close to the end of my stay in Newmarket! It's a rather small restaurant but it's very bright, clean and cozy. The staff is very friendly and polite. The food is also really good too!  Both times I came here, I ordered the B2 bento with chicken teriyaki. I wanted to go with something different on my second time but the food was just so good and the bento came with a really nice variety that I couldn't resist. The miso soup was really flavorful and although the salad that came with the bento was just iceberg lettuce with shaved carrots, the super tasty ginger salad dressing really made it stand out.  The chicken teriyaki was really succulent. The portion of it was a little on the smaller side in comparison with what I've seen in most restaurants but it was actually the absolute perfect amount for me so I'm not complaining one bit. The tempura (shrimp, sweet potato, eggplant and some kind of squash) was also a little on the oily side but it was still very crisp and tasty. I also got the chance to try out their cucumber/avacado roll, as the bento comes with three pieces. It was really tasty and enjoyable, especially since the roe it came with was nice and small.  My only complaint was that the gyoza were a little strange. I think that they were vegetarian... I've had really good vegetarian gyoza before but these ones ended up tasting more like spring rolls.  Also, my friend ordered the sushi sets. The fish was extremely fresh and came in rather generous portions; the sashimi slices were pretty thick. I thought her salmon set looked really cute; there was salmon maki, salmon nigiri and salmon sashimi all arranged really nicely.  Definitely a place that I know I would go back to very often if I was going to be in Newmarket again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean and well decorated. Very modern feel.  Waitress was prompt and courteous.  The food was just okay to me. Not terrible but not a ton of flavour either.  There's lots to choose from on the menu. I will definitely go back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Not for the sushi connoisseur by any means.  Food is average,  sushi chef not very good and not willing to make any substitutions to horribly conceived combos.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been a Sushi Sushi regular almost since the place opened.  Never had a bad meal.  Love just about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sushi Sushi for years. I usually take out. The food is almost always made perfectly. Lunch prices are very reasonable. Only downfall would be  the staff. Sometimes they are rude and sometimes they are friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. Fish is fresh. I love the thick cut on sashimi. Very reasonably price. My only complaints are the miso soup is too salty and salad that came with teriyaki beef and rice is only consisted of lettuce. Otherwise atmosphere is good, service is nice. This is my current go to sushi place."}
{"text":"I feel this restaurant is a disgrace to Japanese cuisine, the food is over priced and Gross and the manner the food is served in is in acceptable, I ordered the sushi set lunch, weirdly part of it came out first then 10 miutes later the other half came out, the waiter said that it was a mistake also not to mention the tea is tame and flavourless and is basically water, the sushi was gross and wasn't finished properly, wasabi was not placed between the fish and rice, the rice didn't have enough acid, as it didn't bring out the natural sweetness of the fish. If u wanna get roped off and spend 10 bucks on shit this is the place for you, never coming again"}
{"text":"The best clean friendly competitive sushi place in newmarket. Quick and friendly place , maintain high standards in food and service . The sushi maker quietly works seems very serious but he makes it best and when you know him he is very friendly. Mixed Tripura  fish is their specialty.  Very tasty  home made salad dressing . Only three people run the show and run it efficiently.  The smiling  face of the server makes the place welcoming"}
{"text":"Went here ordered the curry don katsu (friend pork cutlet) with ramen and their rolls are fairly good. Food came fairly quickly, portions were good, food was tasty ! It's not super super straight from japan japanese food, but for calgary this place comes pretty close. Plus their mango cheesecake is always a must have dessert ! Interior is nice and contemporary. Owners are always super friendly. I'd come for a quick japanese food fix !"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent take out customer. The sashimi is always fresh and portioned generously in comparison to a lot of other Japanese restaurants. Definitely one of the better and more consistent Japanese restaurants up in New Market. Prices are fairly reasonable too for the quality."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the deep fried baby octopus and tentacles!  Love their new ramen. Great atmosphere.  Great service."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets one star is because they won't let me give it ZERO. We got there at 6:55pm, got seated and that was the last time we talked to someone until I told the manager we were leaving and going somewhere else.  Filled out our sheet and sat at our table. Not offered tea, not asked if we were okay. Nothing. Even as tables around us were being served.  Truly disappointed as we only have two options for sushi in this end of Calgary. I guess I learned a lesson, it's better to drive a little bit to actually get food."}
{"text":"We first went to this restaurant shortly after it opened and today (a few months later) was our second visit.  Our impression of the restaurant on our first visit was good.  The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating.  The cooked food was good and sushi/sashimi fish were fresh.  This place really hasn't done a lot of advertising, at least not from what I can see.  The result is that this restaurant is not very busy.  I believe we were only one of three occupied tables during our second visit.  On our second visit, we ordered some sashimi and sushi.  Again, the raw fish were all very fresh.  The sushi rice on the nigiri was of the right size and have good consistency/texture and tasted okay (though not exceptional).  The waiting staff were again very friendly during our visit and checked on us regularly to make sure we were looked after."}
{"text":"Always the freshest sushi and nicest people. This is my go to place and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Ontario and Quebec!  I have been eating sushi from this restaurant  for about 20 years and it's the best by far, and I've eaten sushi in Japan and Vancouver so my frame of reference is global in scope. The fish is always fresh, the rice is immaculate, and prepared to perfection. In addition the service is excellent and pleasant."}
{"text":"So i've tried this place for take-out a couple of times now and I was suprised when I saw a couple negative reviews. I don't know JACK about sushi and fish quality etc etc. But I do know what tastes good and what isn't a ripoff price and I felt like this place hit both of those points quite well. Also a prior review stated that the tuna was white, so yo, heads up.... I went and ordered the tuna and it was a nice fresh red/pink colour so that must have changed. Try this place out, and if you have and though the quality since has dropped off, give it another chance maybe they stepped up their game ? :)"}
{"text":"Time to find a new sushi restaurant.  I had been going to Sushi Sushi over the years, always satisfied with the with the meal even if it didn't blow my socks off.  However, my latest visit revealed the first symptom of a failing restaurant.  I ordered my usual Sushi/Sashimi combo, and was disturbed to see that they had replaced the red tuna with the cheaper, chewier, mystery meat called \"white tuna\".   White tuna seems to be the protein of choice for cheap AYCE sushi bars, possibly from the canning grade of Albacore Tuna, or the sketchy Flake Mackerel.  Not for me.   My other dish, a chicken with noodles, was nearly tasteless.  I left it behind with the white tuna, and my farewell.  If I hear that Sushi Sushi has banned white tuna from the premises, I may need to give them another chance, but for now, there are so many better sushi options, there is no need to ever settle for lower grade food."}
{"text":"Sushi always consistently good. Clean. Rarely busy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite take out sushi locations in Newmarket. The prices are average for sushi. I usually indulge on their lunch time pricing. Quality in my opinion, is great, especially their sashimi. The owners are also great. Very friendly and very personable. Menu is available online. Service is rather quick."}
{"text":"Miso soup is better than most, but the rice to meat ratio on their rolls was terrible.  Service was friendly and went out of the way to help me out (2 kids under 2 years old)... So they get stars for that."}
{"text":"Ode to this den for overeaters.  This is an all you can eat sushi joint.  The food is clean and pretty well put together.  We were stuffed silly by the time we left.  The price is pretty on par with other places.  Also, there was a continuous stream of people coming in and out."}
{"text":"I like their selection of seafood and that it's an unassuming place frequented by many locals. Seemed to me this restaurant is also family run and they used to have a second (now closed) one in Aurora.    Service was fast and the people running the place very nice.  The atmosphere is not terribly fancy but it's a superior alternative to eating at the mall food court!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy this sushi establishment. Although it is not AYCE, its quality and flavor are top notch. I usually opt for take out and have not been disappointed with the orders. It's hard to keep those crunchy rolls crunchy when ordering take out but some how, Sushi Sushi does it!   I'm a fan of their Wellington roll (avocado & salmon), yam roll, Newmarket roll (salmon, lettuce, mayo & crab), Rainbow roll, Hawaii roll (BBQ eel, cucumber, avocado and roe), & the spicy crispy salmon roll. The sashimi cuts are like seafood steaks - they are huge!   Do I recommend? Yup!"}
{"text":"Craving for some japanese food.   Thought we would hit up somewhere close. Was also hoping I would find a chirashi don here. Nope. Not the greatest impression when I walk in and it's a Chinese chef wearing a baseball cap behind the sushi bar... With a young child digging around the service station.   Anywhos... Got sat in a wonderful corner table. Where I was able to watch other people pick at the food. We opted for some some safe choices. We got the assorted sashimi platter, Teriyaki tori Don, salmon with spicy sauce roll and two salmon nigiri.   The entrées both came with soup and salad. If you're in the mood for super salty miso soup and watery cut up lettuce then this is the place to come.   The salad was seriously just lettuce with a touch of japanese dressing. With each bite there was a flood of water that came from between the leaves; at least I know my food was washed. There was an inch of water at the bottom of my salad bowl :D  The entrées were presented beautifully. There was so much garnish on the sashimi platter! I coulda totally brought it home to make myself a daikon salad. I feel they have a strange obsession with radishes here... I didn't touch them though. A few of my sashimi pieces were a chewy mess... Much too tough to finish. The cuts of fish were a good size and quite thick cut.   The teriyaki tori don was... Meh. The rice was classic Chinese rice, it was accompanied by some hard broccoli and pickled carrot slices. The chicken it self was more soy based than sweet.   I died a bit eating the spicy salmon roll... The rice was quite squishy and they were a bit heavy handed on the Tabasco. The rice to salmon ratio for the nigiri threw me off... It still confuses me.  All the food did smell good and look good though... The server was very pleasant and service was super fast. Probably not coming back unless there is a big improvement in the future..."}
{"text":"I have been here in the past and it was good so I stopped in tonight.  Unfortunatley I was told at the door that the wait for sushi  would be an hour!!!!  I contemplated while she checked with the sushi chef and was then told 2 hours!!!!!  Unreal.  I asked her what about these people in here, are they having to wait an hour for thier food?  She said they already ordered??  Ok so what does that matter the chef still needs to make thier sushi.   I understand they have a sushi special on where $1.25 per piece which is great but if your chef can't keep up with the orders then what is the point if itcauses you to loose potential customers.  I was told if I wanted hot food that it would be quicker...she suggested I try tomorrow night.  I'm sorry but I can't say I'll be back again after this I'd rather drive to Kinjo and pay a bit more and know I don't have to fill up on green tea for 2 hours waiting for sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi lovers, I recommend very cheap price, fresh food and fish , The attendants are very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi. Considering my husband hates most seafood and was literally chopsticks deep in sashimi tells you something.  The restaurant is fairly small but will seat about 50.  The host and sushi chefs there knew the people we came with and were so friendly and accommodating considering we were a large group with no reservation.  The menu is huge and there was quite an assortment of sushi, sashimi, maki, and ramen/udon dishes to choose from.  We stuck to the sushi, sashimi and maki rolls although one person had the teriyaki niku ramen and it was fairly tasty.    The sashimi was so fresh and melt in your mouth buttery, there were a few pieces in the salmon sushi (the ones with rice) that were a bit chewy but otherwise fine and much better than other places.  Plus the fact the the portions of the sashimi were quite large was impressive, and the quality was top notch.  We had the tuna and salmon sashimi and both were fantastic.    We opted for the following: Sushi Sushi house special roll and it was really really good, like I went back the same week and had it for lunch, good.  We also had ordered cali rolls for the kids and they devoured them along with, the jumbo dragon roll, saki and muguro rolls, unagi roll, spicy tuna and something else with tempura yam that I don't remember roll, but was quite delicious.  I would definitely come back here, the place is a hidden gem in the NW and literally within 10 minutes from home.  The price is reasonable and on Mondays they offer a slight discount on some items.  $180 for 8 people and we couldn't finish the last two dishes.    4.5 stars from me."}
