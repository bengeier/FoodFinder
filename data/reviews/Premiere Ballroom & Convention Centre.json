{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Crown Prince and Crown Princess Fine Dining.  Another restaurant with Western decor and waiters/waitresses in maid outfits serving dimsum--so mismatched.  Anyways, it's not that big of a deal, at least not to me because the spaciousness and luxurious surrounding is more than what most Chinese restaurants can provide, so I will let go of the fact that it is mismatched. 

Food-wise, they offer a decent variety of dimsum.  If you place your order before 11AM, all S, M, and L dimsum dishes will only be $2.90.  There wasn't any dish in particular that stood out.  The dishes weren't exceptional, but the dishes were better than what most Chinese restaurants have to offer.

I would eat here again, but off the top of my head, I can already think of a few other places where I would rather go: Casa Imperial, Crown Prince (I like the food at Crown Prince more, and it's cheaper too!), hmmm..."}
{"text":"The decor and food was very good here.  I like the idea that banquet halls are being used more and more as an alternative  to actually visiting a restaurant.  The amount of space and the comfort of not having another table sit right next to you, makes the dining experience more enjoyable. 

Most of the dim sum items ordered this morning was very well prepared and came out in a very timely manner.  

An area in which they can improve on, is having special dishes that are not on the menu.   Most restaurants during the dim sum hours will have special items that are unique  and brought out to customers to entice them to try.

Will i come back... yes.  Location, food and service was very good.  Don't see this combination in Chinese restaurant very often."}
{"text":"This place is totally overpriced for Dim Sum. You will be paying for the ballroom and not for the quality of food. They also charge a whopping!! $15 for tea. Is that crazy for what???  Never again will I go here for average Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Such bad experience - diluted tea, below average overpriced food and horrible horrible service (lovely contrast between the maid uniforms and their bitchy faces + rude voices).Most people probably came here only because they have big tables that can hold 12+ people for family gathering."}
{"text":"This giant space served only so-so dim sum. No wait at peak dim sum hours though."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Rush you through the whole meal and dim the light to signal you are the last table and want you to leave. Lots of food flies durning the whole dinner. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Extremely spacious. Staff were rude though. 

I came a couple of times with friends and family for dim sum. The food was ok. Not the top notch version of dim sum. I have had better elsewhere. But there were some items on the menu that were worth trying like congee with clams and shrimp dumplings. The sweets were generally ok."}
{"text":"Price is reasobable for dim sum but not that many selection. Portion are big compared to most of the dim sum places, especially the rice and noodles. Great service! I will definitely go back for dim sum."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on the Monday following boxing day (because we had that day off in lieu of Boxing day being on the Saturday)...terrible idea. We arrived at 10:05am hoping to be able order before 11 (to get the special price) but ended up getting our seat at 11:15am. I understand that its the norm to wait for a seat but over an hour?!!

When we did get a seat it took about 20 minutes for our first dish to arrive and each dish came out slowly one after another. The place was understaffed and you could tell that the servers were really having a hard time keeping up. 

I got tired of trying to flag down the waitresses/waiters to refill our tea pot so I just went up to the place where they dispense the boiling water and filled it for myself. We ended up leaving at 2pm!! Thankfully we had no other plans that day.

Prices were not cheap...I didn't like how they made the Har Gow (Ha Gow?) XL size!!

Prices were as follows:
Small $3
Medium $4.10
Large $5.10
Extra Large $6.10

I'd like to think that service isn't usually this slow here and perhaps I picked a bad day, but I can only give an evaluation based on what I've experienced and my experience was terrible!"}

{"text":"I went to this place for Dim Sum because it has become a more well known spot in Richmond Hill for Dim Sum.   
-Finding parking was rather easy (my luck?)
-Am I the only one who thinks the decor is rather tasteless and tacky??  Why are we having Victorian statues, mosaic arts and some sort of French paintings everywhere in a Chinese Dim Sum spot?  I much prefer oriental decor or just simple minimalistic furniture.    
-After 30 minutes of waiting, we were seated in front of a JUMBOTRON feeding us with pre-recorded shows, ads and non-stop promotional slideshows.   
-We had to flag down 3 waiters to get our tea.
-We ordered 7 dim sums... the success rate of delivering the right dim sum was 3/7.  
-Two of the dishes were mixed up with other tables';  One was simply wrong and we had to send it back and wait; And the last one came 45 mins after ordering..... just before we wanted to leave.  
-The only thing they did right was that they brought us the bill right away.... so they could clear our table and slot new customers in.
-Food wise - a few of the dim sums were barely warm due to the time it took to come...  rather oily.  
Conclusion: not again."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Not up to the areas standard. 
Long wait is expected before seating. Things feel rushed. 
As usual expect poor service and yet you have to fork out lots tips despite you being unhappy with service."}
{"text":"A few entrances connected by a hallway so ask which room you are going to.  

Place is setup for large parties.   We had a family dinner with 25 people so we had two round tables. 

The Chinese dinner menu was multi course fixed which is common.  I believe it was pre-selected with options by our organizer. 

Food was ok.  Presentation was nice and service was really good.   Our eating dishes were changed out frequently between courses and drinks always topped off. 

We had a lot of leftovers and they were promptly boxed and bagged. 

Good option for large parties, especially with kids.  There were multiple birthday parties (for adults) going on and small kids running around.  Was big enough and open enough that it did not bother anyone."}
{"text":"There were 14 of us with several kids. We made reservations and were first given a table too small, and had to stand around for 20 minutes before we were relocated to another table that barely fit. 

The restaurant is huge and the d√©cor is similar to the Crown Prince Fine dining chain with the Victorian tea pots and velvety chairs.

Service:

Poor! 

I'm used to bad service at Chinese restaurants where it's normal to get different servers and having to ask for hot sauce at least three times before you get it..BUT when I become the busboy, that is not cool. The restaurant is clearly short staffed. We asked for 2 high chairs. At first, we were told that they did not have any, and then after several reminders, we got one. We gave up asking for a second high chair. When the food arrived, the servers would drop the dishes abruptly in front of me and deliberately ignore me as I needed to ask them for more napkins.

Due to the amount of food we ordered, we had to make room for more dishes on our lazy Susan and desperately needed to clear our empty dishes. First off, it was tough to flag a server down. When a server finally passed our table, many would not take the dishes (I'm assuming they were asked by their manager to do something else). So...every 5 minutes I had to clear the table by placing the dishes and steamed baskets on a nearby table (where the servers place their napkins etc), as well as refill on our napkins for the table. Clearly, I was the busboy.

Food:

I gave this restaurant as 2 star since the food was not consistent. 

I enjoyed including the marinated chicken feet and snow pea shoots with garlic, but many of the standard him sum items were not amazing. The rice rolls were too thick. For the \"Boon Tong Gow\" (dumpling in soup), the dumpling wrapper was too thick and the broth was bland and watery. The only great thing about it was the presentation and the tobiko on top.


We paid $38 a person for standard dim sum, with many dishes below par. The money you spend for the quality of food is not there. Placing the dim sum on nice dishes does not equate to delicious food. There are too many spots in the city to check out before I return to Premiere Ballroom for a second chance.

I've had great feedback about their dinner, which I have yet to try, so this post is a reflection of their dim sum.

Similar in price range and location, I prefer Golden Court and Dragon Boat Fusion."}
{"text":"Looking at the name, you'd never guess this to be a dim sum spot. The Chinese name translates into Fisherman's Wharf, but the interior certainly looks more like a ballroom. The restaurant is adorned with crystal light fixtures and statues, not to mention it's also so huge inside you can see the whole ballroom no matter where you're sitting. 

We were told to wait 10 minutes by the entrance even though I can clearly see empty tables inside. The line wasn't ridiculous, but most people were trying to make it inside for the early-bird (before 11AM) special, where S, M and L dishes are priced at $3.00 each. 

The Good:
1. BBQ Pork Pastry - Each serving has 3 pieces. The pork wasn't overly sweetened and I could tell that it was freshly baked because of how fluffy the pastry was. 

2. Milk Egg Tart w/ Birds Nest - Be careful not to burn your tongue (like me)! This dessert was served piping hot. The pastry was nice and flaky & the filling was made perfectly. 

3. Eel Rice Roll - The skin of the rice roll has a nice and chewy texture, not over-steamed. The eel filling is something I haven't seen in other dim sum places, and went well with the rice roll.

4. Crab Filling Dumpling - The skin was perfect, as was the filling (crab meat & egg white mixture) 

The A-OK:
1. Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling) - The shrimp itself was fine, but the skin was over cooked, soggy and broke very easily. I had to eat the skin and the shrimp separately. 

2. Beef Tendon - Simmered in a puddle of oil. Not a big fan. 

3. Chicken Bun - Small in size and very dry, not impressed with the texture. 

Once seated, service was quick and our server was nice enough to rush our orders in before the 11AM deadline. Overall, one of the better dim sum places I've been to in the GTA. I'll be back for more early bird dim sum!"}
{"text":"My family usually comes here for dimsum weekend mornings. It's a pretty good deal with small, medium and large dim sum items being $3 each before 11am. The dim sum is usually served pretty quickly here, the only issue is you need to arrive pretty early to get a table (after 10am and it gets crazy packed), if you don't show up early you run the risk of waiting and then getting seated after 11. The interior is large with a high ceiling and classical decor so the atmosphere is very swanky. Food isn't bad, it's like any other dimsum place so it's nothing special, the portions are fair and the price isn't bad so we will keep coming here."}
{"text":"I usually come here with my cousins for dim sum on weekends (come before 11:00 am, their dim sum is discounted but cash only). 
Their selection on dim sum isn't that great or wide but they put in more effort than other places and the service is much better compared to other restaurants.
I recently came here for a wedding and can say that the food is good, doesn't come out cold despite the number of tables however, the service wasn't as good as I was used to.
Nonetheless, great place for brunch with friends and family!"}
{"text":"If Louis XVI hosted Dim Sum in his courts, Premiere Ballroom's setup would most likely resemble that. Huge paintings of scenes of the Renaissance, French maid/servant outfits on the servers, and just general gaudyness... What a smart move for a convention centre to realize that weekend mornings can be a lucrative place to host an ornate Dim Sum for Toronto's insatiable Dim Summers.

And to get a jump on getting people in the door, happy hour before 11 am where S, M, L items are $3 each flat. Unfortunately, it seemed that everything I wanted was XL or SP. 

Also unfortunately, every item seemed to take 40 minutes to prepare and bring out so it was one dainty dish at a time allowing you to fully digest it before the next thing. That's fine for a fancy tasting menu but not for a regular weekly brunch. Be sure you are eating with people you like."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum for my Mama's bday lunch back in December (of last year ). It's always busy, so I suggest always coming here early! (Like 9-10am) The dim sum here is pretty good, not the best I've tasted though. 
It was my first time trying their {Seafood Dumpling in Soup with Bird's Nest} at Premier Ballroom. I always order this dish at dim sum to try it out!! The broth was tasty, and they were very generous with the amount of scallops outside & inside the dumpling (which I loved cause it's my fave!!) !! The bird's nest I really didn't notice, it was just sorta there. If you didn't read the menu you wouldn't even know it's there.  I just really didn't like the fish eggs on top, it made the dish taste a little fishy...

{Fried Pork Dumpling ~ ???}  
Ok so this is my favourite dish of all time, so obviously I'm gonna order it ...I was hoping they wouldn't over fry it like other places...and it was frigging delicious!!  It's perfectly fried where the inside is still soft and chewy, and crunchy on the outside!!!  It's my favourite dish at Premier Ballroom, and the only dish I didn't have a complaint about!! So good"}
{"text":"Was here for a birthday celebration for my mom. Awful, awful service. We had 9 people in our party and we were not given as spacious a table as other families with less people. That was the first sign to me that this wasn't going to be a good experience.

The food itself was okay. Nothing spectacular that explained the ridiculous lineup outside, as it was pretty standard compared to what you see everywhere else, I'd imagine that people were only crazy for it because of the early bird special that we went for. The only memorable thing I ate was their fried tofu, and even then it wasn't especially tasty, but they did a good job of getting it crispy outside but moist inside.

However it was the service that really killed the experience for us.

We then had multiple requests ignored by the staff including getting new chopsticks to replace dirty ones, a bigger helping of hot sauce, and even an extra order of food! At one point one of the servers even made eye contact with me as I had my hand up and a menu raised in my other hand, and just looked away and walked in another direction.

Another woman who I'm assuming was a manager of some kind kept saying she was too busy to help us and apologized, but never offered to get someone else to help us instead. On top of that they never once cleared our table. We ended up getting up and moving our own finished plates to another table nearby, which they somehow had the time to clean.

Needless to say, we were not planning on tipping at all. 5 minutes after they dropped off our bill (apparently they CAN be quick about something) the waitress came back asking if we were ready. We told them no, we needed a few minutes, and she came back again in a few minutes taking the bill and cash when we still weren't done, and we had to tell her again we weren't done. When she came back a third time we were ready and she counted the money on the spot and noted that we didn't put any more than the amount of the bill. We told them that we didn't believe their awful service rated a tip, and she complained saying that they were really busy (that's never an excuse for everything that happened during our meal), but we were firm and left shortly after.

All this combined with the average food made this the worst dim sum place I've ever been to hands down. I always have low expectations on service when I go to a Chinese restaurant of any kind but this was even below MY expectations. I would give this place a 0 star review if I could."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Filthy and dirty from the environment to the food. My family and I got food poisoning from their \"dim sum\". Everything is overpriced and totally not worth it. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My family changes dim sum places quite often because the quality of these restaurants fluctuate a lot. I'm not saying that this place hasn't changed, but it's currently the only one that my family would still consider. There are long line ups at this place, especially around peak hours closer to noon. If you order your dim sum before 11, you can have a discount. 

As for all dim sum places, you'd be better off making a connection with someone (like a manager) to get a discount or free tea. 

I have to mention that the atmosphere is really nice. It is a banquet hall, so there are probably fancy events going on in the evening. However, during the day, it makes for a very interesting dim sum experience unlike some other places."}
{"text":"I think most of the reviews has already pointed it out but just in case you're new to the area don't be so caught off guard by the Victorian style half-theme that this dim sum/event space employs. From the fountain and statues in the foyer to the large Victorian themed art, the porcelain, and even the uniforms that the waitresses wear this place is trying to sell you a Victorian feel. I find that kind of hard to do when you're selling dim sum unless you're also going to plate up your food or present it in a high tea sort of fashion. 

As for the dim sum itself the place isn't too bad minus the prices. The typical Siu Mai and Har Gows are staples you'll get anywhere and I feel like they are at least above average but nothing that will blow your mind. They are on the larger size, juicy and, filled or stuffed with generous quantities of meat, not really much of a nuance here but half-justifies the price. They had a interesting menu items the steamed dumpling with green tea paste. It's on the sweetish side and is wrapped in a banana leaf. It's okay but I'm not sure it's a dish I would go back for. It's a sticky dumpling mostly likely a rice or tapioca base with black sesame infused in the dumpling. The green tea paste is what it is. It's sweet and if you've read any of my other reviews on anything green tea is that it lacks the bitterness that green tea should have. 

My favourite is the molten salted egg yolk bun or here it's just the steamed egg yolk paste bun. It's at least as good as you get yet at other place or even T&T now. But regardless the melty, salted egg yolk against the soft spongy doughiness of the bun that is slightly sweet is just the best. 

Perhaps I'm a tough critic but I'm rarely impressed by a larger dim sum restaurant. Perhaps it's the standard of service from Chinese eating establishments or that the quality of dim sum but I find myself more happily surprised when a smaller establishment bring quality over the quantity of a larger restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice venue. Food is decent however staff is rude. The waitress we had was fairly impolite. Came here for a banquet corporate event. Second time here. Parking is difficult as the lot doesn't fit the venue."}
{"text":"Nice venue for any event.

Came here  tonight for a baby's \"100 Days\" event tonight.  Our 100 guests occupied Room \"A\". This place is spacious enough and the decor is Victorian style, which in itself gives off an old-fashion glam. 

But it's the food that I'm reminiscing as I write this review. 
The 12 course meal served tonight was amazing! Along with the usual suspects (like the lobster and deep fried chicken), they threw in 2 dishes I've never been served at these events.

The first dish to surprise me was veggies & seafood stuffed in a shell, then baked with cheese. The other dish I fell in love with was the fish. Half of the fish was battered and deep fried to the point where you could eat the bones! The other half of the fish was cut into pieces and stir fried with ginger & green onions. Yum, yum, yum!!

No complaints here tonight.  The service was friendly. The food was served hot, and each dish came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"First off, I maybe a little bit bias - but I love this place! Plus I held my wedding here so I'm even more fond of this place. I was looking for something that's Chinese (for my parents) and Western style. I wanted Chinese food, but have a western atmosphere. This is a very hard combination, I found some places where they serve really good food, but the venue - well not so much. So I finally decided to check this place out, I actually had my prom here eons ago, before they were sold, and made it into a Chinese dim sum/dinner place. 

They really changed up the place, it's very Victorian style inside. Have very high ceiling, and I love gold, so there's gold everywhere! Their food is amazing, so I wasn't worry about their food at all. The only downside... it's not cheap. I would say, this is the higher end of all the wedding venue's I've looked it. But, I end up booking this place because they had everything I wanted. Open bar, dessert table, the Chinese menu for my parents and a stage! I really do love the stage...... 

The manager there was wonderful, they both made my day so much easier. Everything was on time, and they took care of little details. I really did enjoy working with them. 

Although, this place did not come with any packages - we had to get our own backdrop/chair covers. But I would still highly recommend this place for future brides/grooms. All my guests told me how full and great the food was, they kept raving about their food (and their open bar).

I do have one minor compliant, I did hear from my guests that they need to hire a happier and less grumpy bartender. Apparently he was grunting the whole night........ other than that. Great venue!"}
{"text":"My mom alleviates my duty as head foodie of the household at times and takes the family on tasting adventures - mostly at Chinese restaurants.  This weekend, after we daughters treated the family to an early Christmas dinner, my mom treated us to \"fancy\" dim sum at the Premiere Ballroom & Convention Centre.

It is no doubt that this restaurant is a roomy one, and as its name implies, was most likely a former banquet hall as the decor suggests.  Although I appreciate its effort to fuse Western and Oriental together, the decor here is a sight for sore eyes.  The elevated platform that is gold with black and white checkered accents on the steps was by far the worst.  And there was just too much gold.  However, I do fancy the high ceilings and the fact that the tables are well-spaced apart to allow for conversation during dim sum hours without having to holler at each other.   For some reason, my culture tends to associate fine dining with the West.  For a culture that is so rich in history and tradition, I still eagerly await the day when we start adorning our fine dining restaurants with Chinese decor and be proud enough to also associate it with fine dining. 

I can't help but feel that Premiere is trying its best to emulate Casa Imperial.  Their servers don black outfits, some with white-laced collars (think tasteful French maid); the decor is very similar (wood and paintings of European nobles) and the China is Western. You will find a few items that are not the norm on dim sum menus.  We sampled a coconut and mango pudding that was plated quite beautifully (like what you'd expect to see as dessert at a Western restaurant).  It tasted quite good as well, although you can't really screw up pudding.

One of my favourite ingredients in Asian desserts is custard.  We had the Sesame Balls with a salted egg yolk and custard filling, and also a Coconut-Custard \"Mille Feuille\" Cake.  The cake was dry but the sesame balls were quite tasty; the filling was a little scant; which I was missing dearly.

The dish that would bring me back to Premiere would've been their Durian Puff Pastry.  Ah yes, durian...  When you mention it to most people you will see them flinch, sigh in disgust or belt out a loud \"Ew!\"  It is a speared fruit which takes skill to open as the fruits are lodged within pods, but if you open it at the wrong angle the fruit will be MIA.  It is notoriously known for its pungent odour and is what I would call an acquired taste.  For me, the stinkier the fruit, the richer the flavour.  But suffice it to say that it is not the type of fruit you'd want to bring to work as you might not have very many friends by the end of the day. The durian pastry here was creamy, milky and heavenly.  Don't worry - its not as pungent as eating the fruit itself.  I highly recommend trying this dish.  C'mon - be adventurous - I dare you!

There was an interested Spring Roll wrapped in Rice Noodles dish that was supposed to be a spin off of the Chinese Donut wrapped in Rice Noodles that was also quite savoury.  But when I think of this dish, I most often think of the taste of the accompanying soy sauce - something that just doesn't seem to taste as good when you try to concoct it at home. 

The Angus Beef Minced \"Pies\" are also worth a try for something different.  These were also pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  Its just something that you can't get at your everyday dim sum restaurant.

Verdict:

The dim sum here was quite average.  Those who want to experience novel dim sum items such as those featured in this post may want to try it out.

For 14 dishes, we paid $77 and had leftovers.  Of their standard dim sum items I would recommend the Chicken Feet (again, another facial-spasm-inducing dish), and the Calamari (very lightly breaded and infused in some sort of soy sauce marinade).

I was slightly put off when we requested for a new pot of tea (at a Chinese restaurant this usually means they refill it with hot water to the point where its just water), but we referred to adding more tea leaves.  The server quickly quipped \"Its only been refilled once.\"  Really?  Are tea leaves becoming the next expensive commodity?  And its not like you don't charge us per head for a pot of tea either.  A good server should adhere to diners' requests (as long as its reasonable).

The wait for a table was less than 5 minutes.  If you pay your bill prior to 11AM there is a discount.  You select your dim sum items from a piece of paper as opposed to the old school (yet nostalgic) push-cart system which I sometimes miss.

Cash only."}

Ok ok. Ya win some you dim sum

{"text":"Dim Sum - I enjoyed the dim sum, this is the best thing they cook here.  I would come back for this.  Traditional dishes and new dishes, all done well.  

Private Banquet (rented room for large party) - 10 course meal was average.  Some dishes had a lot of flavor (like the Curried Conch in Conch Shell) and others had little flavor (like the stir fried Lobster).  The plus is that this place is roomy and has extremely high ceilings.  If you want to feel like you're in a faux Hall of Mirrors at Palace Versailles... well, you've found your match (decorated with some serious classic and baroque euro kitsch).  

Ticketed Parties & Banquets - New Year's and Chinese Year's here is a joke.  $88 for an all you can eat buffet with live band.  You get some quality food items with substandard sauces (half a mini lobster, giant scallop with sweet potato sauce, abalone), but the sushi is crap.  The worst thing is not the food. It's the defeaning loud Canto-pop cover band that refused to play classic hits (Sinatra, Elvis, Neil Diamond) for the older crowd to dance to, but instead took up most of the time yelling Anita Mui songs.  

I wish I could say I was exaggerating about how horrible the band was.  People at all tables were covering their ears.  It was so loud that the sound system was cracking, not to mention the feedback that seemed to occur between every song.  Unfortunately, the band is regularly scheduled to play here.  Yes, I was dragged by my parents and other relatives here, but my review of the band and sound system is unbiased.  I have pictures of strangers covering their ears... maybe I should post them.  

I would come here for dim sum.  I might book Premeire for a private dinner room if it required eight tables or more (one where your parents or business clients insist on having Chinese food), but I'm sure there are better food options available elsewhere.  I would not come here for one of their hosted parties."}

{"text":"Usually come here for dim sum. This is the fanciest and largest dim sum restaurant in the GTA, huge venue with many tables, good for weddings and other celebrations they probably hold after dim sum hours.

I'm never early enough for the early bird special on weekends but at least I don't have to line up as I hear it can be ridiculously long even with the insane amount of tables they have. Dim sum prices are on the higher end. Without early bird specials, to fill two people up, you would probably order 6 plates and end up paying $48ish after tax/tip.

They have such cute Victorian style tea pots and cups it feels like a treat to eat here... Also it is not like other very loud dim sum places. Servers are dressed in these uniforms that make it seem even fancier. Service here is usually alright even with the amount of people eating here at any given time. Never had any of the dishes we ordered forgotten or late although they may come out in a random order (dessert dim sums before entree dim sums).

Recommended dishes: curry octopus (mmm), har gows, shrimp rice rolls, egg tarts with bird nest (you get 4 per order), deep fried squid tentacles. They also have some good dessert dim sums unseen at other places such as the sweet almond pancakes and glutinous rice balls filled with sesame.

Probably my fav dim sum joint in GTA and would get five stars if not for the prices."}
{"text":"You ever want to pour yourself a cup of tea, admire some renaissance paintings, and then take a big bite out of a Hong Kong style egg tart? Yeah, I didn't know I did either. But here we are at Premiere.

Premiere is like East meets West if East went to the 19th century European exhibit at a museum and decided to throw it all into a room. It's a banquet hall turned dim sum restaurant with everything being very fancy schmancy; from the floor-to-ceiling Victorian paintings, decorated porcelain teapots, and indoor fountains. Thus, you can imagine the accompanying $$$ price tag. 

Luckily, they aren't relying on ambiance alone to drive the price. It's still a dim sum restaurant, which is anything but elegant (loud, so loud). The food quality ranges from acceptable to pretty darn good. The staples hold up. Shrimp \"har gow\" dumplings contain fresh bouncy shrimp, siu mai are sizeable, fried squid tentacles are tender and tasty, buns are soft. 

The stand-outs of the bunch are fantastic. Specialty items include the wonderfully pungent durian pastries and addictive deep-fried chicken cartilage. My favourite, the leaky golden custard bun, spills out liquid eggy goodness. Another surprisingly pleasing item is the noodle roll with pork bits and preserved veggies. You see shrimp noodle rolls everywhere, but this was a treat. 

Premiere's not the best of the bunch, but it's by no means the worse. Good place to turn to if you want to class up your regular weekend dim sum routine. Just don't mind the table-hungry horde that's surrounding the host stand at the front. Pro tip, they take reservations.

They have a new menu, a cheaper version, with shitty food and NOTHING special, all the pictures of food I posted before? They don't have those anymore. no more durian puff pastry, no more pineapple custard bun etc.. even the steamed taro is made differently. They must have switched chefs and now they offer a $3 for all S, M, L item before 11am. but each dish is not even WORTH $3. if you are paying more than $3 you are getting ripped off by shitty Dim Sum.

I also came to the banquet here twice, once for an event and another time for a wedding, the food was not bad, most dishes were hits more than miss. But I can't believe I was still hungry after. I don't know if this is a chinese banquet thing or not, but they always serve the food 2-3 hours AFTER the time they said they would, no wonder all every one is always late when they know they are going to a chinese banquet. Also the dessert? Terrible."}
{"text":"This is a ginormous place considering that it's a dim sum place. Dim sum was good and we managed to get a table for 15+ in a matter of time. I was surprised by that part!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for dim sum, the service is good and there is ample parking. Definitely not a long wait to get a table braided they have so many. The food is good and a fair variety. We tried the beef siu mai since it was new to us and it was okay. Definitely prefer the traditional pork version. But the best dish we had was the durian tart - DELICIOUS! Even my husband enjoyed them and he can't stand the pungent smell of the fruit. The only part that was a little weird was the Victorian/French inspired decor... Not the first Chinese restaurant I've been to that had the same theme but I just don't understand it."}
{"text":"I love this place! After coming here twice, it's about time they deserve a review. I love coming here for their creative dishes rather than the typical ones I get back in Brooklyn, New York. This place is beautiful and huge! There a lot of parking spaces available but can still be quite difficult to find a spot if you come on a busy weekend morning. The service is poor and I try to be considerate that it's quite busy. It took me forever to flag someone down for some napkins and a fork. I like the western style but the teacups has to go, I did not enjoy a cup of cold tea. They finally changed my plate when I was full already. 

The earlybird special is $3.00 for any S, M, or L dish."}
{"text":"First time here and was excited as I was told this was a lovely place. Was also told to come super early on a Sunday morning. (Before 11am for half price dim sum NOTE: CASH ONLY). 

The two of us arrived here at 10:15 and were called to sit down at 10:55. By the time the waitress got to the table she clocked us in at 11:05, even though we kindly mentioned we were here before 11am.She just smiled and walked away.  (Why they don't clock people in when they first arrive is beyond me.). Ok. Move on ... As you know that was not a good indication we would get the selection of half price dim sum. To be honest, the majority of our food selection were not part of the half price dim sum anyways. No half price shrimp har gow .. Or the better quality ribs .. Etc , Basically only the cheaper choices. Even the deep fried shrimp although lovely to look at was mostly pastry and three small shrimps inside. All in all we had a variety of food ... And from my experience I've had much better. Actually one of my all time favourite places for dim sum is in china town, Victoria, Vancouver .. Sigh .. But that's for another time :) I would rate the food at average, perhaps a notch below from other dim sum restaurants I've been to. 

Anywho .. 1 1/2 later, with a 75.00 bill and a mind frame of \"let's just move on\", we paid with credit card as the waitress was standing there. After entering the sum, the waitress had the audacity to mention there was no tip on the credit card. \"Of course not, as we prefer to leave cash tips for waitress. \". I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I have never in my entire life been to a restaurant and had this happen. BY THE WAY  : Tips are a curtesy for amazing service, not a necessity in the first place. Anyways my partner, being ever gallant as always and a proper gentleman, mentioned we tip in cash, and she stood there the whole time waiting for him to put it down. OMG !!! it took every ounce of myself to not shove a dim sum in her gob LOL.  Talk about classy .. Horrible experience all around. Poor job in the establishment teaching their hostess. 
On another better note : 
The banquet hall itself however is quite lovely. What you would expect from a large ballroom, complete with a stage. The dinner ware however was shabby and needed up keeping. (Hey I tried keeping it a better note, but one can't hide from the truth ;) ).  

I would definitely recommend moving on .. There are by far better quality Asian dim sum food elsewhere, with much lovelier staff better trained on customer etiquette. There was only one waitress who worked on our side that was so sweet and smiling. Every other poor soul looked as if it was their last day on earth."}
{"text":"Very nice, spacious interior. Service was surprisingly attentive (for a Chinese restaurant). Food could have been better. The rice rolls that we ordered were really sticky and we did not expect the green tea mochi to be really greasy (it was basically a potsticker with green tea filling in it)."}
{"text":"I have a life threatening peanut allergy, so when we asked if there were any peanuts in the items, it wasn't very reassuring to hear them tell us that they didn't know whether or not some items had peanuts or not. I already knew that one of their congee items had peanuts, so I didn't want to risk the cross-contamination and just waited for my family to finish eating so we could leave. 

There also aren't many options in the morning, and what few items they had are more expensive than other places. The egg tarts my sister ordered, the only option for egg tarts, were way more expensive because they added some rare ingredient in it. There wasn't an option to get it without, so we paid way more than we should've."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to dimsum place mainly because my grandma loves their dimsum and they have attentive customer service. We have been visiting for quite a few years now and although they may not be the best dimsum place in the rhill/markham area, they deliver consistent quality and have dependable staple dishes. The hall is very spacious with lots of large tables (great for families) so you would probably have better luck finding a table here during prime hours compared to other nearby dimsum places.

Recommend:
- Egg tarts with birds nest: always so steamy fresh and not overly sweet 
- Har gow (shrimp dumplings): they don't hold back on the shrimps.. So if you are a big har gow lover like me, I definitely recommend this
- Steamed rice rolls: they have different varieties but my family has been loving the steamed rice roll with minced pork quite a lot lately
- Beef short ribs: tender short ribs with sweet BBQ sauce is also on our must order list

Also, I think their price points are reasonable.. Less than $15 per person included tax and tips for a really filling lunch."}
{"text":"Are you looking for somewhat decent dim sum served in a setting that is a combination of modern Hong Kong style interior design and a English \"stately house\"? Well, if you are looking for that setting, this place will have your answer. This place seems to be a place designed for big Chinese banquets but they also serve dim sum in the morning. 

They have this dim sum special in which the prices are significantly lower if you arrive before 10:45 AM. My family wanted to take advantage of this special, and we got some dishes. One good advantage about this place is that the dim sum is made to order, not served in large carts. Another advantage is that the place is really spacious, and there's some large paintings to keep your eyes distracted a tiny bit, unless you see someone that looks gorgeous.

The Ha Gau, also known as the Shrimp Dumplings, were really plump, and I thought it was definitely the best dish they had at this place. The Siu Mai, also known as the Pork and Shrimp dumplings, had a nice garnish, but it made no difference in the decent flavour. The Sin Juk Guen, also known as the Tofu Skin Roll, was not really impressive. It was very soggy and the taste was almost bland and lacked some flavour. The Pumpkin Congee they had tasted kind of funny and strange. They also served Jung Ji, which is this sticky rice dish usually wrapped in lotus leaves, but this was served without lotus leaves. The taste was also kind of bland and lacked flavour. 

Service was just okay. Some of the servers were dressed like they work as housekeepers for an English \"stately house\". The teapots and tea cups were very distinctive compared to any dim sum restaurant I have been to. They had a very English and artful look, giving you the feeling that you are having afternoon tea in an English country house. 

Overall, this is not a bad place to get dim sum in Richmond Hill, but I don't think the dim sum is that great here, unless you enjoy the somewhat \"tacky\" setting and the spaciousness of this place. I can't believe I am giving a mediocre rating to a dim sum restaurant in Richmond Hill, but I am fairly sure that I had better dim sum in Toronto, and even outside of the Greater Toronto Area."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal.

We've been here a few times before but for some reason today's meal really stood out as disappointing. 

Service was fine. As a few reviewers have also pointed out, the early bird special is gone on weekends now. 

Food was poor to average. Some of it seemed poorly prepared, or lacking in flavour. There really is better dim sum elsewhere.

They do accept credit card, which was a plus.

Don't think I'll come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I think the dim sum here is pretty good. This place tries to insert itself into the higher end of dim sum. The decor is all grande and Victorian (I think). The space is huge, which makes sense why they close off a big portion of it for the dim sum hours since they can't possibly fit it all.

The dim sum though I think is better than average. They also have a few items that are special. I like the fried chicken knuckles.

I've come here quite a few times and find getting a seat rather difficult. I've also found that their parking arrangement to be lacking for the amount of people inside. Though now I think there must be less people going because I guess there appears to be enough.

As a convention centre for wedding banquets, I've had some good wedding banquets here. I was quite impressed with the flavor, quantities and quality of the food. Though it's hard to compare because it's all a matter of how much the groom/bride paid.

I'd come here again, in fact I have! It's not cheap for dim sum ($60 for 3 people) so it is on a higher end spectrum."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, nice food, nice service,went there by 10am, seats filled up fast. They have deal before 11am on weekdays for dim sum."}
{"text":"I can't say much about this restaurant as every time I come here, it is different than the last.

The food is a okay. I usually get the Chiu chow dumplings and chicken feet. I find that it is not quite traditional Chinese but where in Toronto could you find that?! 

The waitress usually wear maid dresses and it kind of makes it look depressing. I feel that it is a non feminist area. 

But again the service is okay and food is okay."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. There's a nice variety and the few times I've been here have been consistent. I usually get sui mai and the chicken feet cause that's what I enjoy at dim sum. There's always something new to try and it's usually okay.

The decor is interesting and I like the paintings, too bad they aren't really painted. But still a good choice of art to hang up :) the waitresses here are wearing weird uniforms like little maids. I think it's a little weird and I have yet to see a male server. It's like they're going for a theme but it's a Chinese dim sum restaurant.... Doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I do appreciate the large windows though cause it brightens up the restaurant a lot! 

If you don't mind waiting for a table, come for the dim sum and not the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum in the afternoon in the summer.

The food is ok.  Granted we were there towards the end of dim sum (I think it finished at 4, we finished before that).

Very off putting that staff basically point blankly started clearing our dishes and our tea cups just as we finished.  Like c'mon.  You're flipping the other tables, you can't let us enjoy the ambience?

Don't know why this place is trying to pride itself on the european design.  It's a chinese restaurant, operated by chinese people for asian clientele.  

Food wasn't anything memorable and it was quite pricey."}
{"text":"Your typical dim sum restaurant uptown. The seating is on the newer and nicer side compared to other restaurants, and the tables near the window offer the best experience. 

The wrapping of the shrimp and seafood dumplings is thick and sticky - it would fall apart easily and was messy to eat.

Prices are reasonable and the dim sum came quickly! Service is decent too. It doesn't stand out in particular, but the restaurant is a good option."}
{"text":"This just became my favourite dim sum place. I wasn't sure before coming because they don't have carts. The flavour and portion sizes are excellent. The service is excellent. The staff is there to clear empty dishes so quickly it's like magic. Our order came out at a good pace and the wait for the first dish was minutes. The ambience is excellent. High ceilings, covered chairs and art on the walls."}
{"text":"Funny how this place turned into a dim sum place. I remember this place as the place my school had their graduation ceremony. 

Regardless, expect to wait for a table if you plan to come here for dim sum lunch especially on a weekend. Even if you make a reservation, chances are your table won't be ready till later even if you arrive a bit earlier or on time. 

We've been going to this dim sum place a lot only because my grandma likes the dim sum here in particular. Food and service is decent. No real complaints here. 

Location is grand. The room is quite large and the ceilings are large. You'd think the place would be some kind of fancy European event, but it's a dim sum restaurant instead. There's a stage and fancy bar which does not seem to be in use there. Just there for decoration. Nice chandeliers. There's also massive portraits from what seems to look like it's from Europe in the 1800s?"}
{"text":"The hall is very large, and opulent. The center stage is made of marble, and there were 2 side projectors so that everyone could see while eating dinner.

I was there for a 10 course chinese banquet. The food was good, but not great.

- What is normally \"crab's claw\" came as small, breaded, shrimp balls. It was pretty weird, as the texture was more tough and rubbery, similar to fish balls. It wasn't bad, but the normal crab's claw would have been preferable.

- The fish came heavily battered. It was a good idea, as the whole fish can be quite tedious, but they should have (at least) served it with some sauce, as it was rather dry.

- Dessert was quite good. A sweet chrysanthemum soup with fungus, lychee and dates. Plus a dark sweet rice pudding, and sesame balls.

Everything else was quite standard.

I think the major selling point here is the size of the hall."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for dimsum with my family for years. Food is usually good and service can be a hit or a miss. They were quite busy since it was Chinese New Year weekend, so some dishes took a long time and they missed a dish."}
{"text":"Big crowd on a Sunday for dim sum (to be expected). After we were seated, I reviewed the menu and noticed that it was different from the ones posted by other reviewers here on Yelp (sorry fellow Yelpers, I forgot to grab a pic of the current menu)! This was slightly disappointing, because there were a few items I wanted to try. No matter -- I'll make do. The menu contains a number of the classic dim sum dishes, but then also has a large variety of more unique, modern dishes. 

The quality of the food didn't quite live up to the expectations set by the decor of the place and the long lineup for a table. The rice noodles were coarse and not smooth, the congee was lacking of flavour, and many of the other items were mediocre at best. One of my dining companions, who had been to this place before, remarked that the food quality was not as good as it once was.

The service left a lot to be desired as well. As mentioned by other reviewers, they have a very clear delineation of labour (which isn't uncommon for dim sum places)  -- the servers pretty much only deliver food while there are a small handful of the actual waiters/waitresses/managers who handle all of the real customer interaction, taking orders, etc. In other words, there's a big underpaid workforce doing all the grunt work and the number of actual waiters/waitresses is way too few for the size of the place. It took us forever to get someone to give us a knife so that we can cut some of our food into smaller portions, and finding someone to add a few items to our order was a real pain.

I think I'll pass on this place in the future, if given a choice."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:40am on a Saturday morning for dim sum and its packed just like all the other dim sum places around. We had to take a number and wait for our seats but within a minute we were seated. This place is huge and is nicely decorated. Even the waitresses were dressed up in their maid outfits which made if feel more of a high end place. 

We ordered 15 dishes between the four of us and the bill came to be about $61 after tax. They do have an early bird special which ends at 11am where the sizes small to large are all $3 each. 

Overall I was very pleased with the food and service. Empty dishes were cleared out promptly and the food arrived surprisingly fast even though it was so busy. I liked all the dishes we had and they all tasted really good and freshly made. Definitely a higher quality dim sum than average. The dish that really stood out for me though was the layer cake. You can actually see the layers."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon for dim-sum.

The place is large and spacious. Basically one huge banquet hall (that I'm sure is used for special/private events). Finding your party would be challenging - luckily I was given a table number and left-right directions for how to find the table we were at (once entering).

Food-wise, the meal was OK. I can't say it was by any means superior to most average dim-sum establishments. I will say that one dish that stood out (negatively) was the beef rice noodle rolls. What didn't impress me was that the rice noodle wrapping was very thick and tougher than expected. I don't know if it is a product of them over-steaming the rolls or that it was made that way to begin with, but it wasn't what I would expect.

Western-decor'ed dim-sum establishments are what I'm seeing more and more. Conceptually I do enjoy it as a 'classier' take on the traditional dim-sum joint; let's just make sure it doesn't take away from the food!"}
{"text":"Went for dim sum this morning, CNY so a special event with lion dancers. Solid three for dim sum. 

The food was good, with some dishes better and or hotter than others. Service was slow, but the place was packed. So they continued to bring dishes but took too much time to clear a bunch of empties all at one. 

This is a lovely room with high ceilings, comfortable large tables for big groups and comfortable chairs. I liked the large red lanterns hanging from the ceilings."}
{"text":"Premiere Banquet & Convention Centre....best way to describe it is \"Big and Gaudy\".  In line with its sister restaurants Casa Victoria, Casa Imperial, etc.. the decor is very how do you say very... \"Foo Foo\"?  Super high 30 ft plus ceilings, massive painted murals, workers wearing French/Spanish maid outfits and everything lined in gold.  Who owns this place??  Donald Trump???

This review is for dim sum as we came today for an early mother's day meal.  Like their sister locations the food here is on the expensive side but pretty good.  The har gow and siu mai are really big and tasty and they have some other good dishes that you don't see too often like the sweet and sour fried jumbo wonton skins.  Service is good as the food comes out quickly and accurately, no small feat considering the size of the place.  Being a convention centre, this is probably the biggest Chinese Banquet hall in the GTA and can probably hold at least 100 tables and then some. 

Major negative here is that they charge $1.50 pp tea charge even for kids.  And yes my kids don't drink tea:(  Cost is higher then most dim sum places but on weekdays there's an early bird special for S,M,L dishes of about $3 if you order before 11am.  They used to have this deal on weekends but have discontinued it so we were sh*t outta luck today:)

Overall an expensive but solid place for dim sum."}
{"text":"Place has good dim sum breakfast food, like to come here with my family, they have traditional dishes and new exciting dishes which match my pallet as well. They usually have pretty good service and has a classy environment but not expensive, but today it was super slow and I got super frustrated as I was on a tight schedule. Although today's experience was bad, I would still come back and recommend this place to others.. Been here many times already"}
{"text":"My soon to be father in law hosts his semi-annual company banquet here so he knows all the staff well. My first time dining in Premiere was my first meal of 2013 with my fiance's family aka the morning I got engaged. We returned on this holiday visit and I was reminded of how awesome the customer service was and creative/yummy the dim sums were. The dim sum menu had the traditional shrimp dumplings (but the size of your fist), tripe, chicken feet, beef rice rolls - but also the non so traditional crab dumplings, almond custard buns, egg tarts with birds nest, pumpkin with black sesame, unagi rice roll, tapioca soup with rambutan, and durian puffs. They constantly introduce new items on their menu too so I can never get tired of their dim sums!  I'm sure we will continue to return for many future visits!"}
{"text":"The first time I was here, I was mildly shocked at the fact how this place is meant to be a ballroom (imagine prom), but serving dim sum with tables and tables of chinese seniors!

This is the go to place if you are with a large party since they offer huge tables. Food is okay, I would say your average dim sum, but they do price it slightly higher, and I can see why - better presentation and better environment."}
{"text":"This is our first time having lunch here, and, for a Sunday afternoon, it's relatively easy to get a seat. The decorations are meant to be classy, but it's a little too out of place...for a Chinese Dim sum restaurant...
Any, the DimSum are decent, some REALLY good, some...like the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns are substandard. The bun itself was nice, but the filling was terrible! For what we are paying and there are two other really good DimSum place nearby, I expect MUCH more from them.
As for service, the captains are really good, but the servers...one came by to pick up some empty plates from my table...but while she was doing that, another server came by and they were talking to each other AT our table! What's worse? The server decided to use our table to restack our dirty dishes WITH those from other tables! For the class they are trying to be in, and the price they are charging, I expect MUCH better service than that!"}
{"text":"Base on a relatives recommendation went to this place for the inexpensive early bird special dim sum prices ($3.00 ea).

Place actually doubles as a huge ass ballroom with an ornate high ceiling and super sized Victorian style paintings on the wall, strange but hell I came for the dim sum not the decor.

The huge size works to its advantage as not all the tables are crammed together and creates a quiet atmosphere to enjoy your dim sum

Variety of dim sum offered is extensive (see photos).  For the price, not bad, not bad at all.

BTW, if you still have room for dessert after all the dim sum, try the mango pudding, it comes in a shape of a large carp or the Durian pastry which is creamy smelly goodness in a flaky crust 

Dim sum- 3 stars, early bird special- 5 stars, average 4 stars"}
{"text":"I came here just last week and the quality definitely wasn't as good as before. (last few times I came was probably 1 yr ago) Agreed with the Yelper below that there likely is a change of management. The dishes were oilier and just didn't leave me too impressed. This used to be a good dimsum place :( The dimsum items on the menu remain the same though! 

And for some reason, the waitresses that serve the dimsum were being a tad rude. Soya sauce normally gets served with the cheung fun, and vinegar comes with the beef balls - this is customary practice.  We asked if we could get the accompanying sauce, and on multiple times, they told us to ask the agent to get it for us (the one that seats you, takes your reservation, deals with the bill - not sure how to describe it in English.. Essentially like a head waiter).  Are the waitresses on strike or something?! But regardless the 'agent' was not impressed with their attitude and apologized to us, which was nice of him, but this restaurant has got to get it together.

Decor and everything os the same - Not your typical Chinese decor. Instead it's filled with European style paintings and sculptures. But regardless, this place used to be good.. Now it's just meh mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Love the dim sum at this place. Occasionally the wait can be quite long, but the food is worth the wait. Great selection of food. Slightly pricey."}
{"text":"Been here for Dim Sum a couple of times. Decor is great, food is mediocre, and service is horrendous. 

We sat for 15 minutes waiting for a high chair. And when our toddler was getting impatient, we went to ask a waiter for one and he simply said, \"go find one yourself\" in Chinese. We were beyond our beliefs!

Later on, an order arrived with an ingredient used which we were allergic to (and this wasn't specified on the menu or by the waiter). We told the cash counter attendant whom didn't take responsibility and asked us to go find a manager. When we asked who that may be or if they could send one our way, they asked us to go find one that's dressed in black ourselves.

A few minutes later, we find a manager named Martin and kindly explained the situation to him. He didn't even allow us to finish our explanation, and quickly said, \"You eat what you order. We're not responsible for your allergies.\" We further explained this wasn't specified on the menu or was it indicated by the waiter at the time of our order. He didn't care and kept on insisting that he takes no responsibility of the situation. Just as the conversation was getting heated, he very unwillingly and grudgingly said \"Fine, I'll take the order off your bill.\"

All we wanted was to have a good family meal and couldn't believe the trouble we had to go through at this place.

By the end of our meal, by the way, we still weren't able to get a high chair and ended up stacking two chairs together for our toddler ourselves. 

We highly Do Not recommend this place! Service sucks big time!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine had her wedding venue here and this was the first time I have been to this place. It was beautiful inside, don't be fooled by the looks of the building outside! This place had two different rooms, the room that my friend booked was huge! Beautiful ceiling, the walls were covered in beautiful wallpaper and paintings.

The center stage was nice too, everything about the room was great. The only thing that did not go with the rooms was the washrooms. It felt like a mall washroom.

Our server was the best server we had in a very long time. He catered to 3 or 4 tables and was still on top on filling our drinks, grabbing us hot sauce, serving our food efficiently and quick. Didn't get his name but the service blew my mind. 

Most of the food on the menu was delicious. The Crab claws, jelly fish and roasted pork was delicious! The shark fin soup was better than most places I have been to and their snow peas, shiitake mushrooms with abalone was so yummy! The lobster was also amazing. Didn't try anything else because I was so full but overall this place is GREAT for weddings! 

Can't really comment on the bar since there was no open bar at this wedding. 

There are also many hotels very close to the venue. The bride and groom booked a whole floor for the guests, it was a 5-10 minute walk to venue.  

Can't wait to try their dimsum!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Victorian-inspired convention hall/dim sum restaurant! Must say it's an odd combination but when it's not crazy busy, it's a nice place to enjoy your meal. They don't take reservations so we arrived at 9:15am on a Sunday to ensure we'd get a table. Sure enough, the place was still mostly empty so I got a table immediately upon arrival. The captain and waitresses were nice enough and I personally had no issues with their service. Do keep in mind that when you go for dim sum almost anywhere, don't be expecting exceptional service. No complaints for any of the dim sums we've ordered. Compared to most other dim sum places, I think premier has a slightly classier facade so their food is presented slightly nicer (not as messy and less of a we-just-scooped-this-out-of-a-bucket feel) As for food quality and taste, pretty good! 

Special mention goes to the baked durian pie and sweet egg yolk paste layer cake. I've never seen the durian pie offered anywhere else and it's really yummy! Good durian flavor, soft centre and a firm outer crust. As for the layer cake, it's the best I've had. 
Try to come earlier so that if you order your dim sum before 11:00am, it's $3 for small, medium, and large dim sums. There are also some dim sums on the order slip that are not available before 11am and SP are not applicable to the $3 special. 

Would definitely return to try a few of the other dim sums but prefer to go on a weekday. Weekends are too crazy!"}
{"text":"Went to a friends wedding venue in the Markham area, and lemme tell you, this spot was beautiful. you wouldnt expect that from the outside since we walked from our hotel which took 2 mins which was convenient! The venue was perfect inside gold wallpaper and historic paintings which was also huge, took me a great 20 mins to appreciate the cosmetics of the venue, There was a 12 course meal which got me full by the 5th and our server was on point. he made sure we were well taken care of. At the end of the day we had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves"}
{"text":"I don't understand why my mother loves this place. Well....probably because it has ridiculously high ceilings, big \"marble\" statues and fancy looking decor in general. However, I'm more focused on the food. As normal dimsum places go, there's the usual S/M/L/XL/SP for the dimsum size/prices. This place only has 2 at S, maybe 1? at M and a wholeeee lot of items at L and XL. The issue is that the ones they consider L or XL is something that should usually be considered S! Like siu mai (pork dumplings with shrimp and fish eggs)...why is this XL here? 

I find the food is never hot when it arrives, and given the sheer size of the place, the food takes a long time to get to the table, and getting the staff's attention is also a mission. Overall, for the price of the dimsum, and the \"MEH\" quality of what you get, I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for dim sum. The service is quick, the food is pretty good and best yet, it's a massive location with plenty of seating and shorter wait times. We came here for Chinese New Year and their hostesses were a disaster, but once we got in, the quality and service was consistent even though they were extremely busy during this occasion."}
{"text":"When I stepped inside Premiere Ballroom & Convention Centre, I was really impressed! 

The high ceiling, huge room and the lavish decoration. The wait staffs all dressed up in their little french maid uniforms, the nice table setting, the interesting menu that offers some unique items...

I have high hopes for their dim sum, but I left totally disappointed!!

Milk Egg Tart with Bird Nest ($7) - the fillings are nicely done but the pastry shell are soggy

Har Gow ($4.90) - One of the best item, the wrapping has a nice chewiness and shrimps fresh and have a nice bite

Crispy Chicken Gristle ($7) - tasted stale and feel like been sitting around for awhile, the batter has no seasoning at all anyway!

BBQ Pork Puff Pastry ($3.90) - A -OK

Bitter Melon with Salty Egg ($5.95) - A-OK, but served cool...?

Chiu Chow Dumpling ($5.90) - squid ball with fish wrapping, great bite but the broth a little too salty for my taste

Deep Fried Durian Puff ($4.90) - filling is generous but the puff all soggy, not fresh

Lamb Dumpling ($4.90) - no effort in seasoning the lamb resulted in overwhelming gamey taste! FAIL

Shrimp & Veggie Flour Roll ($4.90) - Over steamed the wrapping 

Deep Fried Taro Dumpling ($3.90) - one of the worst taro dumpling, the filling has no taste at all! 

Mochi with BBQ Duck ($4.90) - fillings are good and tasty but they over steamed the mochi

On a busy Sunday afternoon, all the dim sums arrived like a couple minutes after we placed our order. It is NOT a good sign! I really doubt they steamed them when ordered like some of the places I been to! So not surprisingly that a lot of the food tasted over cooked or have been sitting around under the heat lamp for awhile.

I doubt I will come back for dim sum even with their Early Bird Special!!"}
{"text":"Love the dim sum here : ) the decor looks luxury and elegant. They have a great selection of tea and food"}
{"text":"I was absolutely in awe upon entering this \"restaurant\". Honestly... I felt like royalty just standing beneath the castle-like ceilings, crystal lighting, carpeting, fancy fountains... even the staff were incredibly well-dressed. This restaurant really redefines the Dim in Dim Sum (pun very much intended).

Proptip - go on weekday brunches for price fixe a la carte. This means regardless of the serving size of Dim Sum, the price per serving will be fixed relative to what's outlined on the menu. This is your best opportunity to try out different dishes without the worry of breaking the bank.

Food on the other hand, did not live up to the decor (although the expectations were set VERY high). It was a little bit pricey for the quality of the taste, but taking into account the interior design, I guess it's pretty reasonable.

What I ordered:
Soup Dumplings - standard - typical soup dumplings that did not WOW me
Pumpkin congee - yes yes yes! This was super tasteful, healthy, and had nice squash undertones.
Vegetable steamed dumplings - pretty good. rice exterior layer was not too sticky or wet, but the vegetables inside could use a bit more seasoning.
Shrimp Rice Roll - standard
Mango Pudding - standard - probably made from a mix. At least it was shaped like a fish.

Overall, the experience of eating here was pretty cool, but I definitely would not be a regular."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the fanciest dimsum places I've been to.  If you walk in then you know what I mean.

The dimsum here is pretty tasty and you get a wide selection to choose from.  Plus price is pretty reasonable.

Huge place too which means lots of tables to sit and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Think french maids and school headmistresses serving you dim sum. 

I've been here a couple of times and the uniforms always make me feel like I'm in a 17th century French dining hall decorated with ceiling-high paintings of Marie Antoinette and 15th century Italian sculptures. And the tea cups are so fancy and European I feel like I should have my pinkies out. 

Garish, but endearing. So much confused opulence, but I actually love that.

Decor and clothing aside, the food is pretty decent. 

Though there used to be mass lineups on the weekends, but it was a breeze to get in recently so maybe the real deal dim sum connoisseurs have gone elsewhere? 

Who knows."}
{"text":"It used to be a good dimsum place but the quality has deteriorated (looks like new ownership has stepped in). Food is a bit pricey for it's quality. 

Overall, a bit too much oil and msg in the food. The pork spare ribs were good and quite tender. The sweet pancake rolls were too powdery and doughy - I would not recommend."}
{"text":"4 stars for the dimsum here.

I never knew this place existed until i yelped it.

very open and roomy, nice tea pots and big cups so you dont have to refill so often.
They have some unique dimsum options and waitresses dress who dress like french maids.

Food tasted good... customer service was good as well.  First time i had the lady pour tea for me after she brought it.  

I would come back, although it is pricey.  Especially if you miss the earlybird special."}
{"text":"I woke up ridiculously early one day to try out a new dim sum restaurant in Richmond Hill. It turns out that this place has the same owner as Crown Prince Fine Dining & Banquet, one of my favourite spots for early bird dim sum. Incidentally, half of the menu was absolutely identical to Crown Prince, down to the very wording. Their early bird special is also similar: $2.90 fixed price for any S, M or L dishes.

Now onto the food!

Angus beef and mushroom stuffed tart: tasted like a Chinese version of chicken pot pie. I didn't enjoy the tart because I didn't get that rich, meaty flavour that I was expecting from the filling. There was also too much pastry. 

Pan fried meat buns: why is the bun green? Despite my affinity for green food, this just looked like food colouring and didn't appeal to me at all. The filling was unremarkable as well.

Sticky rice with meat and conpoy: looked identical to the ones from Crown Prince. They were served in three individually wrapped morsels, which made it easy to pack home. Luckily, this was a pretty satisfying follow-up to the first two disappointing dishes. 

Pan fried pancake with seafood and chives: the texture should be slightly springy from the glutinous rice flour, and this was just mushy. The chives, while visible, were nonexistent in terms of flavour. 

Rice noodle stuffed with spring roll was another dish straight from Crown Prince's menu. While it still tasted pretty good, I would prefer the noodle roll to be presented in rows, like the way it is at Crown Prince. Maybe I'm just being too picky. 

Steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow): these were actually pretty good. The dumpling was large and filled with sweet, juicy shrimps. 

Sweet egg yolk paste layer cake: my favourite dessert from Crown Prince, so I was excited that they also serve it here. While the flavours were still delicious, this version was executed less successfully in terms of texture. The layers were somewhat blended into a mushy mess. 

Sweet yam and coconut tart: loved the combination of sweet potato and coconut! Although it seemed as if the coconut was just a garnish, it was actually incorporated into the filling as well. I could definitely taste both the yam and the coconut. I prefer my tarts with more filling and less pastry, so the thin tart shell was perfect for me.

I don't think I will be coming back to this place for dim sum on my own accord. I prefer both the food and the d√©cor of Crown Prince. The only standout item was the sweet yam and coconut tart. Everything else was unimpressive for the price, and I'd be much happier sticking to Crown Prince."}
{"text":"Very impressive looking hall. So I decided to try the dim sum. I actually found the food to be pretty good but still not like Hong Kong or canton.
I was going to give 4 stars but took a star away after to was told by the waitress they do not get any of the tips and that the house keeps it all. Very low of them to do this. And they probably hire all illegals to do the job and that's how they get away with it!!! 
Not nice!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service i've ever had in my life, made a yelp account just to review this trash. I said thanks you at least 5 times every time they bring an item and dosent even look or anwser. Waited 30 minutes just to get someone to pay the bill when it is not even busy."}
{"text":"We came here because we couldn't get a seat somewhere else - my grandparents can't deal with waiting, and we were seated immediately here. Which, as it turns out, is not a good sign.

The service wasn't great and while I don't really care about service at Chinese restaurants as long as the food is good, we've been going to Legend for dimsum, which provides very kind, polished service. Plus the food was not good here.

The menu itself wasn't great - there are so many types of dimsum and everyone has their faves, but nothing really jumped out at me here. I place a lot of importance on sweet dishes at dimsum places and nothing about the selection here interested me. So I decided to order the mango \"thousand layer cake\". It didn't taste like mangos at all, and the cake was dense and hard - no good. 

The savoury dishes weren't much better. The cheung fun was rough and thick - really poor quality. The siu mai was ok. Huge. The fried taro dumplings could have been a lot more fragrant. I was told the chicken feet were ok - I don't like that dish so I didn't have any. We also ordered a noodle dish with fuzzy melon, dried shrimp, shredded bbq duck, and glass noodles and rice vermicelli. It was oily and had no flavour. 

There really is much better dimsum to be had in Toronto. The quality of the food at Premiere can be found at other dimsum restaurants for 50-75% of the price. Like, say, Century Palace. If you are happy to pay a premium for good dimsum, Legend or Dragon Boat are much better choices."}
{"text":"I thought I had turned into the wrong parking lot. The outside did not seem like a dim sum restaurant. The decor is not what I expected at all from a chinese dim sum restaurant. It's all so Victorian; from the paintings on the wall, statues by the door, and teapots. My aunt told me that it used to be a ballroom. Guess the owners decided to stick with that theme. 

Can't speak to the price of the dim sum since I didn't pay. I can say that my family had a good time and I didn't hear any complaints of the food. In fact, it seems as some dim sum dishes offer more (quantity wise) than other restaurants."}
