{"text":"It pains me to write this, Sweet Lulu. You've been in my life for years. So it is with great disappointment and sadness that I write this review.

Sweet Lulu has always been a Queen West staple and I have many fond memories of date nights and lazy day deliveries. The concept is perfect and the meal has all the elements one could possibly want in a dish - noodles, protein, veggies, garnish and sauce, all customized to your liking.

My beef (no pun intended) began when both my husband and I started noticing tummy troubles after consuming the main dish. At first, I tried to brush it off as something else we had eaten that day, but it started happening more frequently. Before, just one of us or the other... but now, both of us.

I'm not sure what's causing this issue or if some wacky ingredient has been thrown into the mix but unfortunately now, you're just somebody that I used to know.

NOTE: The extra star is for the friendly phone service and awesome delivery dude."}
{"text":"This restaurant allows you to build your own meal the way you like it. They let you choose from a lot of options such as picking noodles/rice, stir-fry/soup, what kind of sauce/soup base and any extra ingredients (coriander, garlic, chili etc.). I went with the stir-fried rice with the Thai sauce along with garlic, basil, coriander and chili, with chicken and vegetables. The food here is very versatile and tastes fresh and yummy though I wouldn't say it's amazing or anything unique about it, just that it's the only place I've seen where you can custom-order a particular dish. Service was also fast and efficient with friendly waiters/waitresses. This restaurant is OK in my book.

{"text":"Sweet Lulu's entrance is actually on Temperance Street so it's a little hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. 

This is a decent option when you have a noodle craving - you get to customize your bowl of noodles with the type of noodle, flavour, herbs and protein. We tried the vegetarian hot thai flavour with thick ribbon noodles and chicken malay flavor with rice stick noodles. Both were pretty good but the hot thai was not spicy at all (in my opinion) and the malay flavor could use more peanut sauce! Both were on the salty side but was pleasantly surprised with the amount of vegetables and chicken in the bowls. Prices are a little expensive for what is served but I guess that's what you get in the financial district. 

Service was super quick - we got our food within 5 minutes and it was piping hot. Will come back to try other flavours!"}
{"text":"I dream about sweet lulu...
I've only eaten in the restaurant once - there are no w/c's so I don't want to risk it. Take out is quick and the portions are on the side of large. The malay sauce is fantastic. My go to is the veg with tofu, malay, brown rice and all of the spices. I would love to know how many calories this dish has as I eat it way too often."}
{"text":"I've been to Sweet Lulu a few times and every time has been the same - amazing. This is a great casual spot and if you're looking for some really tasty and filling Asian fusion food, this is the place to go. 

Whether you're eating in or taking out, you always get big portions and consistently good quality food.  

I love that you can make your own meal, You get to choose a base (rice or noodles), a sauce, some herbs, and your meat. I usually get either the Hokkien or the Rice ribbon noodles, the Malay (sweet Peanut satay) sauce, Coriander and crushed garlic, and chicken or beef. 

Prices are low, usually around $12-15 per person. A place to check out for sure."}
{"text":"Out of all three locations, this one is my least favourite. It still has the slick decor and the minimalist menu where you pick your noodle, your protein, your sauce and contents, but it's not as cozy or big on service. Part of what I like about the others are that they have a neighborhood, family feel and the they have great service.

This one, partly because it's on Bay I'm sure, is more of a process them and get them out kinda joint. On the plus side, I bet they are way faster than the others."}
{"text":"Sweet Lulu is a great little spot to eat if you just want some noodles or if you want an alternative takeout, OR if you're a picky eater who's always altering your order. You pick a noodle, pick a sauce, a protein, etc and they put it all together for you. They have those cute square cardboard take away boxes and the décor is modern and simple just like their dishes. There's a few in the city now, but the Queen St. one is the coziest by far, even if it's the slowest for takeout in all of them."}
{"text":"The third in a trilogy of restaurants, the Church Street Sweet Lulu has all the charm of the original Queen location and it's a great addition to Church St. which is mostly bistros and burger joints.

This is one of those fail safe spots you can take anyone of any taste to and find them something to eat.

It's hard to bring big groups because it's small so the wait time for a big group could be long, in fact the wait time could be long in general, but you don't need a reservation and the price points are decent."}
{"text":"Great restaurant - I ordered tofu and then they let me know that there would be egg - so they know what a vegan would be looking for. I just try not to eat meat, I'm not afraid of a egg, but I realized why they mentioned it later.

Has a decent amount of seating and is very quick for take out. I'll be here every week."}
{"text":"Have been visiting Sweet Lu Lu for years now at the Queen West location next to Trinity Bellwood Park. Love this place as they were one of the first to introduce such a concept allowing clients to customize their own dish. The service continues to be great as the owner makes sure he is on the ground helping out the team deliver great meals. Just had lunch for the fist time at the Bay location and the quality is consistent as usual.
My order goes as such: Edamame for starters. Followed by own signature plate: Steamed Brown Rice - Thai (Medium) for flavor - Shredded Ginger as an extra herb - Chicken Breast w/ Vegetables and finally topped with Cashews.
Love this combination!!! Highly recommend Sweet Lu Lu in case you haven't tried it already."}
{"text":"Great location and REALLY fast service. Streamlined service and good tasting food. It's a surprise sometimes if you don't know which combinations are good. 

The place is very loud and they don't keep it very clean but a quick bite is no problem"}
{"text":"If you are interested in authentic, affordable Asian food, this is not the place. Especially if it's Laksa you want. The dish they call Laksa is a bland comparison to the real Malaysian curry based coconut soup. Unfortunately authentic Malaysian is hard to find in Toronto, so people will think Sweet Lulu is decent enough, but for anyone who has tasted a genuine Laksa, made in a good Malaysian restaurant, you will be disappointed at their bland efforts."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat at this place again.  One of their cooks had a cold, blew his nose all over his hands and then proceeded to cook up my meal without washing his hands.  I could see the whole thing unfold in front of my eyes.  Suffice to say, I canceled my order.  Puts itself out as high end chinese fast food but overpriced and disgusting.  Use the extra price to pay for a cab to Chinatown, at least you know what to expect.  +ives: nothing; -ives: enough said above."}
{"text":"This place has a cool concept - pick your own noodles, sauce, toppings, etc. But the quality isn't that great. It's pretty cheap tasting food that comes in huge portions. It's definitely more noodles or rice than meat or vegetables. I had the vegetables and tofu with Thai flavourings and rice. It was alright - nothing exciting. The inside has a cute vibe - large communal tables - colourful decor - sort of out place in the middle of the dreary financial district, but I hear it's packed daily."}
{"text":"Our office orders from here at least once a week. Great \"make your own\" stirfrys. Try the Laksa soup too."}
{"text":"Went here April 17th with a friend for lunch (3:00 pm) and found it to be completely empty. I ordered the chicken and vegetables with the broad noodle and garlic with mild Thai sauce. My friend ordered the same, but hot Thai sauce. 
We were told to have a seat and our food would be brought over. Within 2 minutes our food was boiling steaming hot in front of us. Excellent food, just wish my chicken wasn't so shredded. Glad I work just around the corner, I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Spotted this place on my way to another restaurant. Thought I'd give it a try since I've never seen it before. Definitely impressed! The hokkien noodles with laksa soup and chicken was great and didn't feel salty. 

The only thing to note is that their spice level is very mild. Dishes marked spicy had very little kick to them. I usually order mild dishes, so the fact that I found it not spicy means it really isn't."}
{"text":"Love this place! I will usually pick up one of two combinations - either chicken with medium thai sauce or shanghai noodles with black bean. Both are DELICIOUS!! They have an online payment system so I order online, pay online, and pick up in 20 minutes, perfect for a quick weeknight meal :)"}
{"text":"A friend's band was playing up the street and a group of us went looking for food between sound check and show time. We wanted something quickish, cheapish, with beer and enough room for 7 at dinner hour on a Friday. Enter Sweet Lulu. 

The service was pretty good. Prompt, friendly, and no errors. Exactly what we needed. Our server even laughed at my bf's 'white person hot' joke and was very happy to split our bill at the end of the meal. Go her. 

The menu was pretty easy to navigate, though I was feeling far too lazy to make all the decisions about noodles, sauces, herbs, and meats. I had tom yum soup (meh. fine) and spring rolls (meh. fine). Most of the table had noodle bowls, which were big and tasty, but nowhere near 'authentic'. This is definitely Asian food for white people. The beer selection is Asian lager or Canadian lager, which will do in a pinch. 

A fine place to grab some cheapish grub in an area dominated by either really grungy or quite upscale restos."}
{"text":"Fast Asian cuisine that's delicious. Seems weekdays are the best time to come here if you want to sit down and eat right away. The menu is straight forward; 5 steps to order a rice or noodle main. Easy. I had the fried rice, beef stir fry, with Chinese flavouring (oyster sauce). The portion was generous and I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Came here with two colleagues for a (very) late lunch, as we had heard so many great things about Sweet Lulu, but none of us had ever actually been. 

I had tofu and stir-fried veg, with wheat noodles, malay sauce and black pepper. Absolutely delicious. The freshness of the ingredients hit me from the second I tasted my meal - the flavours were so refreshing. I chose the malay sauce after reading great things about it on here, and it was definitely interesting - mild, but with a somewhat spicy aftertaste. I really liked it! The tofu was tasty and had something of a sweet flavour. One of my colleagues also had the malay, with beef and brown rice, and she was thrilled. Our other friend, who's from Vietnam, had beef with the laska soup and he liked it a lot, but claimed it wasn't very authentically Asian in its flavour. That didn't bother me though, a tasty meal is a tasty meal!

The server was very helpful and patient with us as we made our choices. Price-wise, Sweet Lulu isn't cheap; I had one of the cheapest options on the menu, with no drink, and it came to almost $12. No complaints though, as the portion size combined with the fresh, filling nature of the meal ensured I definitely got value for money. You can really save money and time on dinner by coming here for lunch!

I was also very impressed with how fresh everything was even though we came well after the rush, at about 3.15. The lines are out the door of this place from 12.30-2.30, so I was anxious that we would be left with stale ingredients. There was no need to worry, this was as fresh a fast-food meal as you're likely to get and coming later on in the day ensured we had plenty of seats and space to dine-in.

The only let-down was the saltyness of the sauce. I didn't realise it when eating, but I have been knocking back litres of water ever since I finished my meal three hours ago. Nothing can quench my thirst! Maybe Sweet Lulu isn't quite as healthy as it seems?  

Still a great change from the processed, unfresh food of The Path though, and a lovely place for lunch."}
{"text":"It was a cute little restaurant that you get to customize your whole order. Waitress was extremely nice and gave great service.

Nothing really stood out to me when I came. 

Might give this place another try, but not anytime soon.

ALSO, it's pretty cute that they do their delivery on a bicycle. They have a wooden (I think it's wooden) box attached to the back of the bike with the Sweet Lulu logo."}
{"text":"My only complaint about my meal here was that I was still hungry afterwards.  I ordered the flat rice noodle with tofu and veggies and all the herbs/spices except for ginger and chili flakes. I thought the dish tasted wonderful. Though the bowl looked like a good serving size, there was a lot of bean sprouts in my dish, and not a lot of noodles.
Maybe it was a one-off and usually the portions are better, maybe I was just extra hungry. Prices here are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've always been missing my hometown laksa, and so my bf hunted down this restaurant to bring me to try. While the laksa still pales in comparison to the authentic laksa, I'd say it's probably the best or second best choice when I'm craving for laksa. Their Malaysian peanut sauce (not too sure of the name) used in stir fry is spectacular! It never fails to put a very happy smile on my bf's face and tummy! check that out!

Downside is there's not that many locations and the food is a wee bit expensive for a poor student like me."}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh food, fast and friendly service in a great space. New favorite lunch place!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Affordable and quick food, lots of options and you have lots of choice on flavours and contents. However I feel like the sauces are all too salty and leave a taste in my mouth after eating. However, the dishes are always tasty."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with the portion of my serving. I'm a pretty beefy male with a huge appetite and my stomach is now satisfied... for the time being. Spicy chilli + chicken was great. I'd be lying if I said I won't be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I stopped for take out lunch today and pleasantly surprised.  Given the other Thai offerings on the street, I felt this was the best."}
{"text":"Went in here with my girlfriend for a quick dinner and that's exactly what we got. The menu is easy and you'd be making your orders in about a minute. Would definitely drop by again."}
{"text":"My partner and I love Sweet Lulu's food and delivery guy, but the on-line ordering system is very problematic. Even though the on-line system is promoted when you call, the web site isn't set up to take delivery orders or cash orders. You can't complete the order without entering a credit card number. To get around the delivery issue, staff have previously instructed me to write \"delivery\" in  the special instruction section. This evening I called about bypassing the credit card payment section and a staff member cheerfully told me to \"make up a credit card number\" and write \"cash\" in the special instructions as well.  As I suspected, I couldn't just make up a number, it was rejected as invalid. I eventually inputted my own credit card number to get through it. 

50 minutes went by after I finished the order. I called Lulu's. No one there had noticed that I had requested \"delivery\". It was sitting there as take out. It took me repeating myself several times for them to realize their mistake. It was loud in the restaurant and their phone kept cutting out. (This is why I usually go with the on-line ordering.) The women on the phone seemed to be barely paying attention to me. She was laughing at something. She handed the phone over to a man and I had to explain the situation again. He apologized eventually, but he didn't offer to cover our meals or make any retribution. He also didn't attempt to explain what went wrong. He said he'd send us a new order \"within an hour.\" I was so mad I told him to forget it. 

If I ever order there again, I'm doing it over the phone. 

TL;DR on-line ordering if messed up and they don't care if they forget to deliver your dinner."}
{"text":"Not so sweet. It was an enjoyable enough experience, cool concept but I'm probs not going back unless I'm really in a pinch. The décor could have been cute if it wasn't slightly falling apart here and there. Seems people are always asking what each noodle looks like- I know I would- so I appreciated the little display of the dry ones. You pick your noodle/rice element, the sauce and then you can add herbs. I like how the guy didn't get mad at me when I asked for almost every herb. 

The vegetables were nice in my meal, the broccoli soaked up the juices. But I like my green curry. I didn't sign up for green curry soup and that what I got. NG. Though scoring several of Kate M.'s cashews was also a nice touch. 

I also made the huge mistake of \"when in Rome\"-ing. I really like coconut so I ordered the authentic-looking coconut juice. It was gross. Not Lulu's fault, but just don't order it.  

Good for a quick bite. Cheap. Quality- not so much."}
{"text":"Great noodles I give this place a 5 out 5 
This place is spotless very clean great service"}
{"text":"I have to say - they obviously read their reviews. 
they improved hugely after my recent rant, and I'm very pleased to see that."}
{"text":"My house mates order from here quite a bit so finally one evening I thought I'd try Sweet Lulu's for noodles.
I had the Rice Stick Noodles, Thai hot Chicken Breast with Vegetables for $9.95 and my girlfriend had the Malay noodles Vegetarian for $7.95.

Both dishes included crushed garlic, shredded ginger and coriander.

Delivery took an hour, so for that I probably would not order again, but to their credit they did say so in advance. 

I enjoyed the malay noodles that my girlfriend ordered, nice flavourful dish dominated by satay/peanut sauce.

If I ordered from here again, and I probably wouldn't given how many other options there are in TO, I would never order the Thai hot, Rice Stick Noodles. The dish was so salty I could only handle a few mouthfuls. Not sure if they just screwed it up that night and dumped too much MSG in or not, but it sucked. 

We also ordered Cold Vegetarian Rolls. Not the best I've had, very un-memorable actually.

I think the branding and niche this place is filling is unique, But as we're lucky there are so many options in Toronto, I would probably try another place before giving Sweet Lulu another chance.  From the other reviews people seem quite happy, and indeed it could have just been a bad dish."}
{"text":"Horrible. Hard to find.  And when i did it was gross. I asked for sweet peanut sauce and they added chili flakes. Then they said the Chinese sauce wouldn't be spicy but it's sooooo salty I couldn't eat it. So I got a refund and will never return"}
{"text":"Excellent.
Service was pretty quick, maybe less than 5 minute wait.  and the food was hot and tasty!

I had the chicken with vegetables and flat rice noodles.  Loved it!

Recommend for nice hot, quick lunch.  The cafeteria style seating option is interesting and could make it a good place for single person lunch or larger groups too."}
{"text":"Was starving when I came here but really wasn't feeling stir fry. After ordering my flat rice noodle with vegetables in tom yum soup (with every topping except black pepper), I took a glance around the store and regretted not ordering stir fry. The portions appear to be so much larger!!

Overall, the taste was such and delicious, though I was somewhat disappointed by the all portion of veggies they gave me in my soup noodles. Will definitely order stir fry next time!"}
{"text":"A nice little place to get your stir fry fix! It's fairly pricey for a fast food noodle place but it does let you mix and match your noodles and sauce. I got the hokkien noodles in mild Thai sauce with chicken, shredded ginger, crushed garlic, crushed nuts, coriander, lemongrass, basil and lime leaves which had really good flavours and you could taste a hint of ginger which I liked. The only complaint was it was a touch salty and the nuts were very coarsely crushed, I had a few whole nuts.

My girlfriend on the other hand got a rice stick noodles with chinese sauce, shredded ginger and chicken which I liked more than mine because it was simple and sweet and also with a hint of ginger. It was also a little salty for my liking."}
{"text":"3.5 solid stars. If you want good Asian fusion custom dishes fast - Sweet Lulu is for you.

1) Pick you meat or seafood - Chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu or seafood.
2) Pick your sauce - Black bean, Thai, Malay or Chinese (Oyster)
3) Pick your noodle - Rice, Pad Thai, shanghai etc.
3) Pick your fresh herbs to add on top - i.e. basil, Garlic, Ginger etc.

Voila - your custom dish arrives at rapid pace. No joke, maybe 2-3 minutes. Perfect if your in a rush.

Most importantly - the food is good and tasty. It's worth crawling out of the Path for this if your in the Financial district.

Lot's of seating inside or takeout.

{"text":"For a quick meal, Sweet Lulu offers a simple and tasty menu. My girlfriend swears by this place for a fast lunch.

Our selection was:
1) Protein: beef and vegetables
2) Rice/noodle:  rice ribbon
3) Flavour: Medium thai
4) Herbs: shredded ginger, sweet basil, chili flakes.

We also ordered the Laksa soup (similar to a green curry). I enjoy the unlimited herbs! For take-out, they gave me a nice, re-usable cloth bag.

It is a bit pricey for the portion sizes (meals run between $9-$13), but if you're looking for fast food and simple flavours, Sweet Lulu isn't that bad."}
{"text":"Went at lunch on a Friday, it was a packed house.  First off , they basically forgot my order, so my friends were eating away and I never got my food.  The whole concept of waitresses wandering around trying to see the microscopic signs on the tables is a bit stupid anyway.  
They did refund me for my order which was nice (after I had to ask though, they didn't offer).

When I finally got my food... it was... ok, nothing special.  But more edible than the food courts in the PATH so I guess that's something."}
{"text":"Fast, fast, fast!  We ordered, we sat down, we ate.  We were there in the evening when all the good business folk have gone home, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  

What great sized portions!  I wasn't expecting to be stuffed on tofu with wheat noodles in a peanut malay sauce, but found myself staggering out with an over-stuffed belly when I was done.  Taste-wise, I really couldn't find any special reason to come back especially for its offerings. 

Tip: When you want water from the tap, say, \"I want tap water.\"  Otherwise, they'll give you bottled, which of course, ain't free."}
{"text":"This place is convenient located in the financial district. I like how you can customize the 1) protein (chicken, beef, tofu, etc), 2) the soup base (malay, satay, thai, etc) and the 3) noodles (egg, rice, rice ribbons) and 4) toppings (lime, lemongrass, etc). They are quick with your order, and the taste is on par with a fast-food noodle joint. I recommend the malay chicken rice noodles, which had a good balance of flavors. However, they do close early at 7pm like many other eateries in the area."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when I went to eat here, but every person I spoke to was recommending this place and saying amazing things about it. After my 1st meal here I fell immediately in love and would eat here almost every week. Great food, love the make your own dish where you get to pick the meat+vegtables, carbs type and sauce... the least u can say is that their selection of vegetables is so fresh and amazingly good. Highly recommended place for lunch and dinner..."}
{"text":"I love this lunch spot whenever I'm craving rice noodles of some sort. I love this place because you get to customize everything - the type of noodles, protein, sauce, toppings, etc. Sometimes the line can get long, but they're pretty efficient so it goes quickly. There's quite a bit of space if you want to eat there, but you can easily get takeout. They'll pile everything into a takeout container that looks deceptively small. Once you pour it back onto a plate, you'll be surprised at just HOW much food is there."}
{"text":"Visited Tues April 11 for dinner
The place was fairly empty.
Eating downtown shouldn't cost an arm and a leg, and this place is perfect to grab dinner after work! My friends have come here multiple times and this place deserves a higher rating. Long communal table with unique ambiance. 

Pros 
Cold vegetarian roll, comes with 2 rolls. They are fairly big, so open wide. A bit too much lettuce in my opinion. 
Unique selection of noodles, use the noodle guide to help you pick. 
Custom made noodle or rice dishes
Love that we can custom the spices/herbs!
Service is fast, eating within 3 min!

Cons
Ran out of peanut sauce for the vegetarian rolls. 
Menu was a bit too high, so you have to strain your neck to see the menu. They end up giving you the take-out menu to order from. 
Some construction along Temperance obstructs the entrance. 
Closes at 7pm, you would think there would be more suits grabbing dinner late into the night.  

Protip - Easier to use the Temperance than the Bay St entrance. 

Damage - Only $12!"}
{"text":"We usually love the noodle dishes that we order but this time I decided to try the tom yum soup. It basically tasted like plain noodles in water. Very little flavour or seasoning. 

Spring rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"This pretense of a S'pore/Singaporean or Msia/Malaysian food place is exact as such, a pretense.

Just paid $16 for a bowl of Shrimp 'laksa' noodle soup which was basically wholesale purchased orange coloured soup base filled with stuff.  Not really sure why they even called in Laksa, I'm originally from KL, Malaysia, this is definately not Laksa lol.

I would suggest for potential patrons to chose other food options for lunch, otherwise if you really crave singaporean/malaysian style food, this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love this place. You get to create your very own meal. My favorite is beef + rice ribbon noodles + Malay sauce + chili flakes/sweet basil. Thai sauce is also very tasty! Great selection too. It's a bit pricy $12/bowl. I guess that's average price for downtown food. But at least it is made in front you! Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh Sweet Lulu...Well you came and you gave without taking.

For the picky foodie snob I can sometimes be, I love this place. A year ago I wouldn't even think of going here but nine months ago on that fateful day, Sweet Lulu found me.

I have to admit, since I've started working 2 years ago I've found it much harder to find the time and energy to cook a meal. Since I usually make a stir fry and I was particularly exhausted that day I decided to give Sweet Lulu a shot -  I haven't stopped since. On average, I probably eat at Sweet Lulu once a week. I know, sick! I have to stop, but it's so easy and tasty. I also probably need to stop eating out so much.

I always get the same order:
Vegetables (extra)
Stir Fried Rice
Malay Sauce
Ginger, Coriander, Garlic, (sometimes Basil or Lime Leaf) and pepper
Cashews (always get cashews...they give so much!!)

At first, it was overwhelming with all of the options but you get the hang of it. The orders are on most days incredibly generous. The service is very sweet too! I always tip because its a small team and they make so much happen in one night. If you eat in, the portions are even bigger!

If you're too tired to cook, or want something thats quick and delicious give Sweet Lulu a shot."}
{"text":"Decided to stopover at this location after reading the reviews. It was a Friday before Thanksgiving and there were considerable less people in the office, so hoped that I could quickly pick up. 

First impressions - it is noisy inside! I assumed the entrance was on Bay Street; it is not, it's in Temperance. 

The ordering was quick and was given a number. Assumed it would be quick. It was busy, and all the kitchen staff were seen working hard. The orders did not come out in sequence. Some numbers after me got their food before me and some numbers who were quite before me still hadn't. The order did take a lot of time to come which was not good. I assumed because it was a Friday before Thanksgiving and a Jays game going on, there wouldn't be a rush. But I can only imagine what it will be on a normal working day. 

Ordered a vegetarian with Thai hot flavour, thin wheat noodles and all the herbs. Cost =$10 + taxes. The container is the same size as Thai Express, but more expensive than Thai Express. The food was quite the same as Thai Express as well. I did not taste garlic or ginger or basil. 

The noodles are good, but the flavour lacked the zing of spicy sauce that I requested and all the herbs and chilli peppers I also requested. Disappointed with the quantity as  well. 

There are many Asian outlets selling at better price, better quality, and better quantity some times"}
{"text":"A-OK. Basically, this is the Subway for noodles and rice. 

First of all, let's figure out how to actually get here. There won't be a direct entrance on Bay Street, despite the address. You can either a) enter through Temperance Street (on the west side of Bay Street), or enter through 350 Bay Street, go down the hall, and enter the restaurant through doors you'll find on your right.

Second, the food. Like I said, it's like Subway - it's a casual joint. You 'build your dish' according to preferences set out in the menu. It's a step by step process. You choose a) your type of noodle or rice, b) your protein, and c) your sauce, and toppings. On my visit today, I purchased the Wheat Noodles on Malay Sauce, with Tofu as my protein. 

Overall, while portion size is great, I didn't find the food anything spectacular. I actually found it quite salty, and the sauce itself, while doused in spices, didn't really have much dimension and felt really plain. Because of convenience, I'll probably be back again since it's such a short walk from work, to but it wouldn't be my first choice in the area. Decent Asian comfort food in the Financial District, but not the best. 

With tax, I paid $12.07 for my order."}
{"text":"My favourite stir-fry noodle place. And the staff are super friendly. A great quick meal"}
{"text":"Oh my sweet Lord where do I begin.
I love this place.
Service is always so friendly.
The food is just incredible. The veggies are so fresh, noodle choice is amazing.
I haven't had any of the soups/curries but I imagine they're just as good.
I keep wanting to come back to try different combinations.
Always go with my boyfriend after work and we both are obsessed!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Sweet Lulu down by Bay and Richmond.  It's tucked away on Temperance St (west of Bay).  I'd say it's a great place a for quick, tasty meal near the financial district with a cool decor and spacious layout to facilitate a decent conversation (so many places in the financial district are so packed or loud that it's hard to have a good conversation). 

The menu basically consists of standard asian appetizers with rice/noodle bowls for entrees.  

My friend and I share the veggie spring rolls.  For my entree, I had a rice bowl with the chicken breast and veggies (Shanghainese Bak Choy, I believe), sweet peanut sauce, rice ribbon topped with cilantro, basil, peanuts, and chili flakes. 

The veggie spring rolls were nothing to right home about.  It's carrots, daikon and lettuce in a rice wrap with a peanut sauce.  It could have used some inspiration: tofu, pickled veggies, something.  It's fine, but I don't think I would order it again.

I really like my noodle bowl.  There was a good amount of meat.  I like the rice ribbon noodles, which are large pieces of rice noodles, and the sweet peanut was tasty.  

Serving size was respectable.  I'm still pretty full a couple hours after my lunch.  

Prices were $8-$12 for the bowls.  Appetizers ranged from $4-6. 

I think it's a good choice for quick, tasty, asian-flavoured food close to the financial district."}
{"text":"I used to order from Sweet Lulu pretty often, and raved about how tasty the little cartons of noodles, the green salad with sesame ginger dressing, and the hot and sour soup were. My usual was the wheat noodles, tofu, and vegetables with malay sauce, and pretty much their entire repertoire of optional seasonings (lemongrass, lime leaves, garlic, ginger, coriander, etc.)
Until one day, my dining companion and I got some takeout and there was something very off about it. It just wasn't the same, it wasn't delicious anymore. I'm not sure whether it was an unlucky day and our food just wasn't up to par, or if we simply got sick of eating there, but I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Have you ever looked at a menu in a restaurant and thought, \"I just wished they used a different sauce, or used rice instead of noodles, or used tofu instead of chicken or tossed in a little cilantro\"? Well for the customer who wants their Asian dishes made to order, Sweet Lulu is for you! 

Their 'design your dish' menu lets you choose noodles or rice, flavouring, meat and veggies and herbs and nuts. I had rice noodles with malay flavouring (sweet peanut satay) veggies and coriander and for eight bucks, I left feeling very satisfied. 

The service was also really great. The restaurant is small but it's clean and the seating is very comfortable. They also do take out, which is great way to get exactly what you want for dinner after a long day's work. It's not haute Thai cuisine but you get a lot of food for your buck and when it's made to order, you can't really complain!"}
{"text":"It's a good spot to grab a quick bite at or to get take out from. It's kind of hard to find the restaurant, because it's well hidden inside a regular looking office building. To get there, go to 350 Bay St, go inside the building and walk straight down the hall, it will be on your right hand side.

The place allows you to customize your own rice/noodle entrée, which is great! I love their Pad Thai noodles with Malay sauce. There aren't too many options, but just enough to satisfy your Thai food cravings. The place gets very busy during lunch time on work days, so make sure you go early if you are with large groups."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and tasty food.

Simple menu - order your protein, your rice/noodle, your flavour and your toppings - soups or stir frys - pick your poison.

They also have a small but delicious list of starter offerings as well.

Food is inexpensive and service is speedy.  It's a nice change from the food court and it's just a short outside walk from my office.

It's a small place though, so would recommend you arrive early if you are with a group and would like to enjoy your food there."}
{"text":"Sweet Lulu's does Asian fusion and allows you to customize your dish with a variety of fresh and tasty ingredients--and it's dang good.

At first purchase, it seems a tad expensive for take out. But dive in, and you realize you're not paying extra for the trendy location (locations in both the financial district and on Queen W) or the adorable design of their restaurant and containers-- inside that charming orange take-out box is exactly what you paid for in quality and quantity, a miracle compared to lunch in the Path. . 

Meals usually come in under $12. The portion sizes are quite large for lunch; too big for me, and I wouldn't call my appetite dainty. Since I happen to love cold leftover noodles, the large portion is perfect--big enough for two reasonable sized lunches. 

The quality of the ingredients and flavours is TOP NOTCH. 
I usually order wheat noodles, veggie (comes with tofu and egg!) with lots of ginger, coriander, cashews and extra chilli flakes to compensate for the fact that the hot thai sauce isn't really hot enough for spice lovers.
I recently branched out to the green curry chicken with coriander on steamed rice, which was fantastic. 

Service is fast and friendly, a well-oiled machine. 

This place is great but by no means mind-blowing; it's only mind-blowing to find such a reasonable place close to the financial district!"}
{"text":"I occasionally stop into Sweet Lulu for a quick lunch on busy work days, due mostly to the fact that it's in the lobby of my office and I don't have to go outside.  I enjoy the rice noodles with Malay (peanut) sauce, but find them a bit heavy at lunch so lately I've been trying other menu items. So far, I'm not impressed. I've had both of the soups (the coconut one is thick like a curry- too heavy for me), the cold rolls (dried out rice paper and full of romaine lettuce leaves) and the tofu satay (so greasy that it seeped through the wrapper and stained my desk). I think the key is to stick to the make-your-own noodles. 

One great thing is that you can place a take-out order online and avoid the lineup, which can get quite long at lunch. Another note: after dining in, my suit smelled like Sweet Lulu for the rest of the day. My advice? Opt for the take-out."}
{"text":"Really interesting place. Kind of reminds of Rice Bar in Kensington (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rice-bar-toronto) except that Sweet Lulu actually creates really flavourful dishes!

There's only seating here for about 10 or so people and I agree with Anna with regards to the wait times. Their menu is on their website if you want to check out what creations you can make but basically it's a create your own dish type place. You choose your noodles/rice, meet, sauce and herbs/extras and let them cook it up for you!

I don't think you can go wrong with any combination and the price is pretty good for the big bowl of food you get."}
{"text":"Was here the other night with my cuz...we were looking for a place to have noodles, and came across Sweet Lulu.  

It was pretty cool - you pick your grain, your sauce and herbs and choice of toppings.  

It was pretty tasty.  I wanted soup noodles but opted for the stir-fry variety instead.  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Excellent variety.  I love their mix and match menu.  Highly customizable.
They also deliver to the bar next door which is awesome for bar nights :)
The staff are friendly and the place is nicely renovated.  The prices aren't that bad... not cheap but ok... :)
Mmmmmm now i'm craving beef in black been sauce with the thick egg noodles... mmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Sweet Lulu gave me a sweet diarrhea that kept me out of commission for several days.

Never again. Never again."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident on Yelp.ca.  I saw satay on the menu and the good reviews, I was already interested to try.  

I originally planned on just ordering a take-out.  By the time I arrived at the place at about 1pm, it was not busy.  I decided to just eat in.  I guess I could not hold to eat till returning to the office, because the good smell of the food from outside the door was irresistible.

You simply order your food at the cashier and pay first .  Staff was very friendly.  You can ask for a cup of water at no charge.   I was given a table stand with a number, my order was delivered to my table within 10 minutes.

The chicken satay was not bad.  The meat was tender and grilled to just perfect.  The tofu satay was just meh and was a bit burnt.  The satay sauce (I would say more like paste) was served cold.  I guess the satay sauce was prepared ahead and stored in the fridge.  It tasted cold and a bit bland.

Maybe I should go back next time and try their stir-fry and tom yum soup instead.  It is definitely a good place to have a sit-down quick lunch at a reasonable price in downtown core.  A 3.5 star for the first experience."}
{"text":"I really like this place... It's small, but it's sort of fitting seeing as their decor and design is very cute and cozy. The staff there is actually pretty great and are always friendly and efficient. From what I can tell the menu is very minimal: you pick your noodles and toppings and you're on your way. It's a little expensive for just noodles, but pretty damn delicious. When I get takeout it comes in a great little cardboard container like old-timey Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Rubbery, sour tofu. Green curry was a soup. Not very flavorful - there should have been more veggies. If you want to try amazing green curry, go to Salad King (when it re-opens). I won't be back to Sweet Lulu."}
{"text":"Note for vegetarians: except for the oyster sauce, all of the sauces and the curry contain fish sauce.  The cashier told me they did not and I asked her to double check with the kitchen. The cooks confirmed that there is fish in all the sauces. This is not very upfront and the website even boasts about how vegetarian friendly they are."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleagues for lunch. The entrance is at this random small road that you turn in before the Bay/Queen intersection. A bit sketchy at first. The restaurant was well renovated, but didn't have any A/C when I was here so it was a little suffocating. 

You make your order at the counter and then they would give you an alphabet stand so they know where to deliver the food. This is like ordering at a fastfood restaurant, but this time they would deliver and cleanup without having you to pay for tips. Price wise it was more expensive that your average food court meal though, I got the chicken bowl without any additional add-ons and it was $12.

The food itself was just average. Presentation wise it looked like something that I could make on my own at home. Definitely just food course grade of food. I don't suggest you coming here if you're grabbing lunch with a client or business partner. Better left for grabbing lunch with your friends and colleagues.

The takeover container was really cute."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this yet?! I've been coming here for years. The staff are mega friendly.

I love the \"design your dish\" concept - pick your grain, flavour, spices and herbs, then your protein. I wish I could say I explored most options on the menu, but THEIR MALAY SAUCE that is OUT OF THIS WORLD has prevented me from doing so.

The few times that I have tried other options, I've been almost equally pleased. Their chicken satay and laksa soup appetizers are deelish!"}
{"text":"Great place to break for lunch in the core. The service is efficient and accommodating to food sensitivities. 

A word of advice; arrive ealry if you plan to dine in, it can get busy qquite quickly."}
{"text":"Been looking for Laksa since my trip to Singapore last year and I finally found it here! 

I ordered it with beef and all the fixins and it was delish! The best time to go is after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I really enjoy this place. I love that you can mix and match your ingredients and tell them what to put into your stir fry. If you know what you are doing (like can cook yourself) then you should be able to create a tasty dish. The malay peanut sauce is a must, and this is a place that does tofu well! I got the beef once and the pieces were really tiny and a bit disappointing so I will always get the tofu from now on."}
{"text":"I order in from here a few times a month. It is my good 'ole standby for quick delivery food for dinner. There isn't much good delivery in this city - this is ok. 

I think it is alittle pricey considering what you are getting - but who am I to complain? I am too lazy to cook the same thing at home.

It is a quick delivery. The food is consistent with no surprises. 

If you are in the Trinty Bellwoods park all day - the food helps you create a great picnic."}
{"text":"This is the location I visit the most. I love it here, the tofu is so good! It's cheap and quite a large portion. The laksa soup is also really good, but I like getting the pad thai noodle with the oyster sauce, tofu/veggie mix, and sweet basil. Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find but worth the search if you're looking for a quick noodle dish or soup. It was my first time trying it based on a friend's recommendation after being at the Eaton's Center. 

I ordered there rice ribbon noodles with chicken and vegetables + Chinese sauce + the following \"herbs\" ginger, garlic, crushed chilies and basil and fresh coriander. 

We had it to go and it didn't disappoint. Although it's not cheap as 2 chicken + vegetables came to $27 (no starters or beverages). 

Would I recommend to a friend? Yes 

Would I go back? Yes"}
{"text":"I'm so hungry. Like crazy hungry right now. But I'm also lazy. And broke.

Why am I telling you this? Because I can't get the thought of Sweet Lulu's Green Curry out of my brain right now. And by brain I mean stomach. My stomach just wont shut up.

At Sweet Lulu you make your own meal. Do you feel like shrimp or chicken or veggie OR EVERYTHING? Spices? You call the shots. I personally love getting some green curry with lemon grass, ginger, and a whole lot of cashews. 

BAH! I shouldn't have written this review. My stomach has begun to growl. 

The only thing stopping me from calling them up, placing my order, walking over and picking up/eating this delicious meal is money. Appertaintly I don't have any. This place isn't expensive or anything though. I just haven't been spending wisely lately. 

And now I must face the consequences. PB&J it is.*

Oh also, there's no bathrooms. So yeah. Don't plan on peeing there?

* Let the record show that I do love a good PB&J sandwich, just craving curry."}
{"text":"Love it.

I rarely eat here, but on this hot summers day, (after waking up from a sunburnt, semi-drunken, cupcake crawl sugar coma induced fitful rest) I made my way west to sit in the park with some friends.  How I did not feel well.

As I rode the trolley cars and listened to shameful pop music I thought 'I really need food... and something like... good.'  I stopped at the 7-11 across from Trinity Bellwoods and then saw Sweet Lulu.  

I ordered chicken whatever you order, with the works and Thai chili sauce and it was exactly what I needed.  It was like when you show up at your parents after a long day of bike riding, and your Mom asks you what you want to drink and you say whatever, and she brings you a big iced lemonade and it's EXACTLY what you needed, at that moment.  That was my Sweet LuLu Experience.  It was exactly what I needed, at that moment.

It was tasty too, I would definitely have this on a regular day."}
{"text":"It can be pretty difficult to make decisions at a create-your-own-meal joint when you're unfamiliar with the menu options, are overly hungry, or worse yet: both. However, ruling out rice, (due to personal preference), and seeing the dried noodle samples provided instant direction. The cashier's honest recommendations for (unlimited and at no additional charge) herb accompaniments were most helpful in completing the task as well. 

My colourful masterpiece of a veggie laksa with rice stick noodles, chili flakes, lime leaves, basil, and coriander was incredibly rich and flavourful. It arrived piping hot, brimming with fresh just cooked through vegetables, and came with a side of fragrant deep fried onion flakes. Unlike previous interpretations of the same noodle soup I have had, it was pleasantly missing that greasy red top layer of oil, but as spicily satisfying as ever.

Sweet Lulu's seating is limited to twelve, spread over two small communal tables in the almost entirely white room. No bathrooms are available, but if you can hold it, you'll be in for a convenient and flavourful treat."}
{"text":"Went there after referred by a friend. Like their design in the room, the light , table and the color all make it very warm and cozy place to have a lunch during working days. Ordered stir fried veggie tofu +wheat noodles + black bean sauce...to be honest, wheat noodles is actually the vermicelli (which is made of rice flour), I thought it should be something like soba..but not. A little bit over-burn smell and a bitter taste. 3 stars for it's environment."}
{"text":"This wasn't an easy place to find but so glad i did!  Out of all the fast food build-your-own-noodle-stir fry places there is in the PATH and around the area Sweet LuLu is the best place!  I had their rice noodle with black bean sauce and beef.  They have more ingredients for you to add in without paying extra and they're also very fast and great with service.  It's a good lunch time place to go to when you're alotted the 1 hour."}
{"text":"I only been there once.. and this review is more personal and maybe a little bias..

This is a cute little place and the idea is great to have you pick whatever you like and how you like your meals to be prepared.

But over $10 for a noodle with chicken and vegetables  that is quite pricey for the quality and quantity you getting.. I am not a big eater and I was still hungry after I ate my soup noodle!

But this is a good place for people that are more picky and want to know exactly what is in the food they ordered.

The services are really friendly and good.... and it is kind of cool to be looking out to Queen street through the big windows when you hanging out with your friends!"}
{"text":"Sweet Lulu is fantastic. They have the cutest logo ever, a really clean and cohesive setup, and a perfect menu. The option to customize your meal every time you come here means you will never have the same meal twice (unless you go a LOT).

Basically you pick your noodles/rice, sauce/soup, meat/tofu/veg, and spices + extras. They really accommodate vegetarian/vegan diets -- they'll ask you what products you're OK with and all the servers are really familiar with the food. They do takeout and your food is packed in those adorable little cartons with the metal handle -- they seem to be a lot more common in the States, I've only ever seen a couple Canadian places use them. 

But I digress. The food is amazing. Sweet Lulu definitely has a Thai influence, but isn't an authentic Thai restaurant, because it doesn't need to be. The food stands alone without being labelled. And the best part about it is that you don't feel so guilty about inhaling plates of it. They use huge amounts of fresh vegetables in all their dishes, and everything just feels cleaner than a typical greasy Thai place, so you know you and your intestines won't be regretting it the next day.

To make my belly happy, I usually get the pad thai noodles with malay sauce and tofu and vegetables, and whatever spices I'm in the mood for. That's my tried-and-true, but my absolute favourite is the Laksa soup -- it's a sweet and spicy coconut broth that is seasoned to perfection and tastes great steaming hot. I think I just drooled.

Besides the food being cheap and delicious, the staff are always courteous and kind, and now they deliver right to your door! And it comes pretty fast. It's a dollar or two extra for delivery, but when it gets brutally cold outside, it's worth it.  I used to call ahead and order takeout to pick up on my way home from work and it was always ready and waiting for me. I say go here, and go often. It's soooo good."}
{"text":"Since I work in the Financial District, I ventured over to Sweet Lulu on the recommendation of a co-worker. The combinations are a bit confusing at first, but essentially you can build your own dish which is nice. 

The food is filling and they certainly give you enough. I didn't like the fact that the rice came on top of the actual chicken/vegetables in the take out box (silly, no?). 

Anyways, the food delivers by all means for a quick lunch, but there is nothing extremely special that would make you come back day after day..."}
{"text":"Love customizing my noodles/rice and sauces! Service is fast & friendly. Prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've been back to this place a few times now (this is right near my work) and either they read this article or otherwise wised up on some things.  If you say \"vegan\" they actually know what that means and have special sauces to accommodate.  While much of their selection is not on my diet these days (oil = fat), I'm happy to recommend this venue to visiting colleagues now, just don't go to sit and eat when it's busy (it's LOUD)."}
{"text":"They do a good job of making noodles here - choosing your starch, sauce, topping, etc and it tastes pretty good, but not amazing.  I'm not sure why my colleagues say that the portions are huge here, I find I will only go here if Oriental Gourmet down the street on Temperance is really busy - they're much more authentic, tasty, and they have even larger portions!"}
{"text":"I think its a cute little place, but the food is not for me. Meals go for a little over $10 a bowl and are a bit too salty.

Ask for less salt, and they will say half the sause. And you say yes.

Note they were kind enough to remake mind with less salt."}
{"text":"Ha.. yeah, 5 stars. I do love it here. 

I work 1 minute away. It is on Temperance street, you have to go onto this street. It's right across an alleyway. I come here for lunch and perhaps dinner. Hours on a weekday: 11am - 7pm

Their busiest time: 12 to 12:30 office lunchtime.

Sweet Lulu is a cozy, little, bright yellow, and very cute Thai fast-food restaurant. You begin by selecting your meat (or no meat), then your soup base or stir fry flavor, your noodle, your herbs/toppings, and then they will ask if you'd like a drink. This is under the main menu \"Design Your Dish.\"

Sides you can get are spring rolls, edamame, satay meats, soups... 

If you are only going for the main dishes (like I usually do), expect to pay about $10-15. Typical downtown lunch prices anyways, right?

You can sit in or you can get takeout -whichever you choose, you only need to pay for food. Tips are welcomed.

Service -fast. Cleanliness -quite. Size of dish -large. Phone reception -not so good.

I love their Tom Yum soup and pad thai. Tom Yum soup is a famous and traditional Thai soup. It's spicy and sour, and it's very delicious. You would have to like spicy Asian foods (plural) to like this one. But I do recommend. Also it's not very spicy here.

FYI: The beef tom yum is more flavorful than the seafood. Unfortunately this is a hit and miss here. Sometimes the beef soup isn't so flavorful. I am still deciding on a favorite... I always end up finishing the soup in my noodle soup dish. It's so yummmm!"}
