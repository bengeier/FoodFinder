{"text":"I was excited as soon as I saw the sign for this place go up, because King W is in serious need of some snacks. I ordered the steak sandwich after seeing another review about it and it was freaking delicious. I got it with added cheese, which seemed to be grilled right into the bun. A+. The fries are fry truck/fish & chips style: aka best eaten drowned in vinegar. Mmm. I can't wait to head back to try the fish & chips. Welcome to the hood!  EDIT: Headed back March 15 for a quick snack of egg and cheese sandwich. Sadly there was no cheese on my sandwich :("}
{"text":"Came by here when they first opened, met with the owner, great concept for this area. One of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had. Fresh, great quality beef (and cheese for that matter), loaded to the max. Just awesome.  Football season, grab your proline/props tickets, pop in here for the rib eye and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Honestly even though this place is half a block from me, I avoided it because I don't like the way it looks. Last night I decided to try it and now I'm pissed I avoided it for so long! I had the ribeye steak sandwich and my girlfriend had the fish and chips. Both were fresh and obviously made in house. They were delicious and inexpensive. The owner is a good guy too. A definite repeat. My advice is don't judge a book by it's cover and try this place!"}
{"text":"The go-to here is the steak sandwich. It's a thin grilled steak with your choice of toppings(ie. mushrooms, cheese, fried onions) on an Italian roll. Nothing fancy but it's pretty good. The fish for their fish & chips is alright, but there's something weird about their tartar sauce. I think they're just adding lemon juice to mayo so it's tastes a bit strange. Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good too.   The fries are ok, they haven't been crispy in the two times I've gone, I probably won't get them anymore.  Overall though a good addition to the neighbourhood, the people working here are really friendly and it's nice to have something other than fast food franchise restaurants on this stretch of King."}
{"text":"Dropped by today( two days in a row) to confirm this place is in fact the real deal.  Yesterday I had one of the best breakfast sandwiches of my life, \"egg and cheese\" with hot peppers and a garlic spread. Needless to say it was good enough that I came back today for lunch Lunch: BEST STEAK SANDWICH I have had in Toronto. Its a real steak( and I mean real), on a fresh bun loaded up with whatever fixings you want, smothered in melted cheese.  Also added bonus: while I waited for my steak sandwich and fries( made on the spot) i picked up a few needed household items/groceries"}
{"text":"Being the new kid on the block, I must say that I'm happy Kings Corner moved into the neighborhood.  I had the chance to meet the owner (Fernando) and he is extremely passionate about setting up shop on King West.  This place will do well.  I've only visited them once and I was very satisfied.  I tried the steak sandwich and fries.  The steak is the real deal, fresh and cooked to perfection.  The amount of meat was very impressive for the amount I paid.  The fries are killer, fresh cut and made to order.  Unlike those frozen fries everyone else serves.  Portions are big and the value is great.  I like the fact that they are open late on weekends, perfect for a meal after pints at the bar.  I must say I'm very impressed and will be stopping by for another meal in the near future.  I want to try the Fish n Chips.  This place has my stamp of approval.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place! Fernando, the owner, is a talkative and kind person but that is just an additional feature of this joint - the burger I had was just awesome for this price. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great steak and egg! Generous portion and the owner is nice and friendly. He's new to the neighbourhood and is open late night for those club goers who would like to avoid McDonalds. Fries are fresh cut and everything is made in front of your face."}
{"text":"Great local spot with delicious, fresh, hot sandwiches! Can't wait for ice cream and milkshakes come summer!!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a quick place to get comfort food takeout in King West. There are lots of salad, international, and bar food options. But sometimes you just want some easy takeout that's not McDs.  Found this place from the Yelp reviews and stopped in on a rainy mid-afternoon.  I had the steak sandwich and an order of fish and chips. The steak is an Angus ribeye cut and was very tender and just the right size for the bread. Bread was nice and soft with a crusty outer layer. I had it with onions, tomatoes, and mayo. Hit the spot, I'll get it again. The fish and chips were also good. I think the owner said it was haddock. Fries are fresh cut. By the time I got home, after a couple stops on the way, they were a bit soggy but still tasty. My fault though, fish and chips are meant to be eaten straight out of the oil. All in all, a nice place for a quick grilled or fried snack, when you're not feeling all healthy and such.  It looks like a convenience store from the outside, but don't let that fool you. The food is the main feature here. Btw, they also serve patties from Allen's, for those who know their patties."}
{"text":"Great Steak Sandwich! Like others, I was skeptical but finally tried it. It's really really really good and very affordable as well. Really recommend this spot :) Owner is a very nice person as well."}
{"text":"I stopped by there for a night out with my friends expecting it to be at least a decent spot, but it was flying with mosquitos and fruits flies. One of the workers were picking flies out of their frozen French fries with their BARE HANDS. I'm super disappointed with my experience and was hoping to get a good steak sandwich - instead we ran out of the door for our dear lives."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I thought I'd try it out. I ordered  a hamburger combo.  The was only one person working the whole place but he did it well. I have an homemade tasting burger, very good, lots of options for topping The fries were fresh cut and pretty good, I prefer thicker fries. I would definitely recommend this place for a great burger"}
{"text":"The mild-mannered fellow behind the counter cooked up a solid breakfast sandwich. The eggs were fried medium with the yolk balanced throughout to award me with pockets of semi-set yellow. The fresh cut fries were brought out of a plastic container and flash fried. Not very crispy after our 5 minute walk but the oft-forgotten but distinctive flavor of potato shines solidly through.  The place is unassuming but these bites we had were solid. Great value!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for take out food :-) Fernando makes his food with care and I just love his personality! He is the friendliest! (Btw try the steak sandwich)"}
{"text":"Food: I ended up getting the steak sandwich.  It was super delicious but had taste closer to pork shoulder than a steak.  A bit more fat than usual.  (but at the same time, for $10 what do you expect).  Atmosphere:  The tables are very small,  wold not recommend going there for eating.  Just take out."}
{"text":"Great environment and the owner sets a great vibe. Friendly, accommodating, and a great cook! Me and my gf went and he immediately changed the rap battle that was playing on the speakers to Simon and Garfunkel. What a great read!   Also the aesthetics in there are next level!   Great experience and would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Now that is a steak sandwich. Absolutely amazing freshly grilled with your choice of toppings. The owners were so nice and have been in business for just over a year. Good choice of food. I will most definitely be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab a grilled cheese, breakfast, blt etc. So fresh and delicious this place is for anyone looking for a delicious greasy meal. Perfection every single time!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim on the first day open and everyone was super friendly and I was recod the streak sandwich with cheese. It was super fresh bun was soft and delish and steak was a real steak fried on the spot. Fries were cut on the spot as well.   Can imagine this is gonna be a sweet late night spot. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
