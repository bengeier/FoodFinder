{"text":"I will admit I am completely biased towards this place. I grew up eating their pizza. Crust is soft and fluffy, not chewy. The cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place. The sauce has spice but not too much. At some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue. Their one downside is that they're not always consistent. Some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done."}
{"text":"Eaten here twicebut only pizza. I do have to say its up there with Napolis or Ailleos as for the pizza. Tonight me and my neighbors were up for some more. Was disappointed when ordering a meatball hoagie to find out they had no meatballs! Pizza places should never run out of certain things. Had gotten a cheese hoagie. Didnt get get why someone would order this, but was told it was good. didnt like. Luckily the pep pizza was great, but.. when u get toward the crust, its all dough. Still kick butt pizza but get rid of the cheese hoagie."}
{"text":"First, I just have to mention that this place--bless 'em--was the only thing open in Morningside during \"Snowmageddon\" (aside from Rite Aid which was picked clean anyway), and we were all kind of stranded up here. I had the Italian hoagie and thought it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten (considering we had been living on canned soup and Chef Boyardee for days). Months later, after the snow had melted and sanity had been restored, we decided to try them again to see if they were as good as we remembered. I got the same hoagie and was surprised that it really was quite tasty! I wouldn't make a special trip for them if I didn't live here, but they're good for what they are! As a side note, we've tried the pizza, and it's rather mediocre. I suggest they change their name to \"Eddie's Hoagie Haus.\""}
{"text":"Really great local pizza. Probably the best crust I've had in a while. Very inexpensive for Pittsburgh but you can taste quality ingredients. They don't have many specialty pizzas. So, don't call in an ask for the works. They don't have it. But if you want a delicious shredded Italian sausage pizza, or a white pizza with tomatoes, they got you."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Dough always fresh, sauce has a nice tang, cheese blend is just right. Delivery has been prompt each time. Definitely our fav neighborhood pizza delivery place."}
{"text":"I've been eating this since I was a kid its never changed and the prices haven't really either. It's a great place if you want local neighborhood  pizza or pizza shop food. I tell alotta people not from around here to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza for an unbeatable price ($10 large). The subs are better than the pizza even. If you're in the area or live nearby this is your best option. Any time I call it's always 19-20 minutes and it's ready in exactly that time frame.

Edit: THE HOAGIES ARE SO GOOD"}
{"text":"This is a small takeout and delivery pizza shop in Morningside.  It has good pizza and salads and I presume the hoagies are also good but I have not tried them.  They doe a very good business and customers appear satisfied with a lot of repeat business.  It appears to be a local favorite.  I had avery good slice of pizza, good cheese, nice sauce and well prepared.  You can get served as a walk-in in 10 minutes or less.  Not the best pizza in Pittsburgh but adequate.  The owners, cooks and staff are all friendly and engaging.  Definitely has a neighborhood feel. I'll definitely be back when I am close by."}
{"text":"Eddie's is great. The place itself definitely isn't going for high marks on aesthetics, it's a pretty small and simple. But what they do get high marks on is their food. They have a big menu and the prices are super low (like $9 for a large pizza). It is cash only. Everything from the cheese to the crust on the pizza is just right. The folks working there always seem pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for Eddies."}
{"text":"After many years, I finally had a chance to try Eddie's Pizza Haus. We got two large pizzas (1 sausage & 1 cheese). I really wish I would have tried this place sooner as the pizza is really good.  I will definitely be a returning customer here.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I've lived less than a mile from Eddie's for the last twenty years.  I often drove past the store but up until two years ago I never stopped.  I mean how good could a pizza shop in the middle of Morningside be?  The answer is darn good.  I gave Eddie's a try on the recommendation of a friend.  My first order was for a pepperoni pizza.  It was at least as good as any pizza that I'd gotten from one of those places in Squirrel Hill.  The pie was cooked to perfection with a crispy outside crust. The red sauce has a kick to it and is not too spicy or sweet.  There was a generous portion of pepperoni and enough cheese that you'd never never have to order it as an extra.  From that day on Eddie's became my go-to pizza shop.  Their subs are reported to be even better than their pizza but I really can't speak to that.  I'm a pizza girl all the way.  I don't mean to give the impression that Eddie's doesn't have s few hiccups.  It's a family business and they shut their doors promptly at 10pm, and they're closed on Sunday.  At times the quality can be inconsistent.  Not the food itself, but occasionally there will be too much or too little sauce on the pie or the crust is less than crispy.  A lot depends on which member of the staff makes your pizza.  I always try to order between 4:00 and 9:00.  Eddie is almost always there at that time.  Eddie oversees all of the food preparation and nothing inferior leaves the shop when he's around.  Another minus is their delivery charge.  I'm sure somewhere tucked away in Pittsburgh there's a shop with better pizza than Eddie's but I sure haven't found it!"}
{"text":"I feel absolutely horrible for giving a 2-star review of this place. 
As a Morningside resident, I was really hoping to love and support the Pizza Haus. I ordered pizza from here for the first time a few days ago. I was probably the worst pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh. 
The price was great, but that was the only thing that was a plus. The crust was very tough. The sauce was so incredibly bland. And there was just an insane amount of cheese.
Never in my household has a pizza been left unfinished (left over cold pizza is the best breakfast of course!), but we threw away probably 1/3 of the large pie. 
I'll give it another shot and try the hoagies, but I'm going to permanently pass on the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza but their hoagies are amazing! The chicken fingers are really good too (we get them for our 5-yr-old daughter who loves them). The pizza is a bit on the greasy side, but it's that good game night/ have a beer kind of grease. The dough is fluffy & flavorful. Only downfall is they're cash only which is kinda tricky when the pizza urge hits & no one has cash. Rite-aid down the street has an ATM though."}
{"text":"According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite."}
