{"text":"Outstanding bulgogi bento box and Bun! They give you free edamame. Happy hour prices for appetizers was a welcome surprise! I also liked the laid back vibe."}
{"text":"One of the better places I've had sushi at. Everything was extremely fresh and everyone was very polite. Even my husband who isn't fond of sushi had a couple of pieces! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yuck, nothing to recommend this place.  Service sucked we ask 5 times for ponzu sauce, finally received it when we asked the manager.  Had to send one roll back because it tasted off."}
{"text":"We waited very long time, their service is very slow. The size of each dish is very small. The taste is okay but it does not deserve the prices."}
{"text":"We ordered the $29 sushi assortment plate and it was a good value and very fresh. The wait staff was very pleasant (Yui was great) and worked with our dietary restrictions (no mayo can be tough when trying to order rolls). Casual and didn't have to wait very long for our good. Upbeat music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Aria O, Sekushi 7 was Awesome Best Sushi ever in Las Vegas having a blast for Mel's  Bday"}
{"text":"Very fresh fish,  good service and reasonable prices. Nice place to dine in vegas!! Good place to have sake and everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant around 11PM on Memorial Day weekend.  It took a while to get someone to take our order.
We ordered some yellowtail sushi, a spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll.  
The spicy tuna and yellowtail were okay.  The rainbow roll was the diameter of my thumb and tasted like it was previously frozen."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great atmosphere & music. Delicious food, great customer service and super fast kitchen to table delivery. Great spot for locals & tourists."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but definitely not worth the price tag. The fish was definitely recently thawed and most of cuts were not as flavorful as you usually find at nice sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Jane was the sweetest server and the Kumamoto oysters were delicious! And the sushi was fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Good Japanese place to eat inside the Paris casino. Had some rolls and miso ramen. Waitress was very nice and helpful. Would come back again!!"}
{"text":"We stuck to nigiri and hand rolls and had a great time. The nigiri were large for the price and tasted great. They also have some interesting items on the menu like foie gras sushi which was really good. Prices are what you would expect for Vegas but we enjoyed all of it, would eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time , their service is really good, so are the food. I really love their green mussels, spicy tuna handroll, surf n turf and kumamoto oysters!! Those are the MUST TRY food!!! I'm glad they satisfied my hunger'! :D"}
{"text":"Came here for late night, got gyoza and couple sushi rolls. Food is amazing, and service is great!"}
{"text":"My wife and i came to get a quick sushi fix here and it was tasty. The AriaO roll had great crunch and good flavour.. The Salmon was fresh."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  OMG!!!  Wow! What a wonderful find!  Located in the walkway between the Paris hotel and Ballys. Amazing Lychee sake! Amazing spicy tuna hand rolls! So wonderful! Great food, great service!  And the freshest sushi I've had in mind years! Yui was our waitress and oh my goodness, what a sweetie!  10's across the board!"}
{"text":"Good service and wonderful food! The best sushi in town. Definitely come back again. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sekushi sushi is a nice option at the Paris hotel. Try the Aria O roll! : salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, massago arare jalapeño, micro cilantro with honey truffle oil."}
{"text":"Are here several times in the past and sushi was great.  Tonight, the otoro pieces (2) I ate was served still slightly frozen.  After eating the 1st piece, I left the 2nd piece on my plate and smashed it around off and on for several minutes.  When I finally ate it, I could see the \"small\" water ponding.  At $15 a piece, I believe it should have been served way better, if not, then better to eat at Nobu.  If only I had my phone to take a picture."}
{"text":"Delicious! Not many Japanese restaurants open at noon. The uni is sweet and unagi is well baked. Had a great time here."}
{"text":"Our first time here and this place has fresh sushi and convenient service! I would recommend the yellowtail jalapeño hand roll."}
{"text":"The food was amazing from beginning to end. The sushi is fresh and the rolls are delicious. 
A must is the chocolate moose cake."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Came out fast and accurate. I recommend this restaurant. 1st time here, definitely will be back when I'm in town. Melissa took great care of us. And surprisingly not expensive for Vegas."}
{"text":"What a great little Japanese restaurant! The bento boxes are fantastic and the service is excellent. We stopped by for a quick meal and were so pleased that we will be eating there again tomorrow. You won't be disappointed dining here."}
{"text":"Fast service and super friendly  definitely recommended . Also if you are eating in a group and want individual checks it's not a problem!!"}
{"text":"I went mid afternoon and it wasn't very busy. The service was good and prompt. I had the 6 piece sashimi chef's choice which came with salmon, tuna, and red snapper. I also had the ari0 roll and the house sake. The roll was nice and spicy. Overall the food was good. I didn't rate it higher because it wasn't anything memorable, just met my expectations."}
{"text":"Good sashmi and sushi place to enjoy Japanese food on the strip. Fast and friendly service . Must try place if you are looking for Japanese cuisine ."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit, and I still think it's as amazing as ever! We came to celebrate my in-laws 32 years of anniversary and they loved it here. There is bento boxes for those who don't eat seafood and a mixture of different sushi. Everything was always freshly made and delicious. Would recommend to any sushi/bento lover!"}
{"text":"I love the food, the waitress was so nice and friendly. I recommend the Aria O roll. It was sooooo good. If you are sushi lover you won't be regret coming to this place. My boyfriend got salmon teriyaki bento and he liked it so much."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a trip and sushi sounded really good. I found this restaurants near me. And I was not disappointed. The service was great as well as the food. Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I had a great experience, no wait, they served the food right away, sushi was fresh. Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. I went to get a couple basic rolls for lunch. The portions are ridiculously small and the prices are too damn high!

I give it two stars for the service? The waiter was nice. Save your money and go buy a sushi roll from the grocery store, you'd probably be more Satisfied with that!"}
{"text":"Nice place, tasty rolls, fresh fish. Although portions are not very large. Would probably come back."}
{"text":"This was our family first trip to Vegas.  The food at Sekushi was amazing. Please try their ramen and their kimino roll. Bia our waitress was very friendly and always had a smile on her face. This place had the best service."}
{"text":"Great service, Novi and Bia was especially helpful in helping us decide a sushi roll that didn't have raw fish in it. Very quick and we love the rolls she helped us pick!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy. Nice service --- they took care of my annoying children when they spilled water on the floor. Not really the best place to take kids....our bad.

Loved the Ario O role. The pork katsu and teriyaki chicken bento for the kids were much better than typical sushi places. Salad dressing and soy sauce were a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday. Was very happy with the selection of rolls. Though the rolls are a few dollars more than some of the smaller sushi restaurants, they offered real crab instead of the imitation crab that many restaurants use. We started with the Wagyu skewers as an appetizer, though they didn't bring it out until after our rolls were served. I ordered a rainbow roll and an avocado and eel roll, my husband ordered the sashimi entree. All were very fresh and well prepared and presented.I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We ate at the new skillet section and it was fun and delicious! We got appetizer skewers first.  I highly recommend the sea bass! I got the salmon skillet with rice. It comes on a very hot skillet wth raw salmon around the edge and the rice piled high in the middle. There is a paper wall around the skillet so tou don't burn yourself  as you start mixing everything together as it cooks in front of you. It was fresh and cooked perfectly with lots of crispy bits on the bottom. A great and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Most overpriced average at best sushi in the world. $30 for three small pieces of salmon and $35 for a boring roll that would have been 7 anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service. The small plate and tapas are excellent. Food is fresh and you can expect good quality."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend coming here for reasonably priced Japanese food (think Vegas). Yui was our server and she's really dedicated and friendly!"}
{"text":"They offer you a free cheesecake if you give them a 5 star. I think that's how they get high ratings.
Food tastes just okay, overpriced. 
Not recommend."}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi place ever. I would spend lots of money on good sushi but this place had the smallest pieces of sushi I have ever seen? Their prices are off the wall and the sushi comes as one order, not in pairs of two (like usual). We have a waitress at the sushi bar? Weird. And what's even more hilarious they told us they had high quality sushi? Haha! The most disgusting place ever!"}
{"text":"The most amazing creamy seafood udon I have ever tasted! Great recommendation by the staff. My husband enjoyed the salmon skin hand roll.  Friendly staff and great food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh, rolls were OK, and the miso was terrific.  I like the edamame being served as soon as I sat down.  Pretty pricy and a little difficult to find.   Restaurant was quiet around 7pm, but plenty of passing people watching traffic.  Not so easy to receive bonus offer."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. Food is pretty good and really fast. The people that work here are super nice too."}
{"text":"Just okay. Rice was tough. Fish was decent. Service was slow (but not horrible). In general, this is a mall-grade, unremarkable sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Sekushi in Las Vegas has excellent service and the food is very good and everyone working here are very friendly and pleasent."}
{"text":"Had happy hour there. Sushi was ok had better. The service was ok. Didn't really care how they put the sushi on the wooden player. We order eight sushi roll items and our table was small they brought out all the sushi at once and of course no place to put them. We didn't have any soy sauce had to flag down the waiter to get us some. We had to wait about 5 minutes for our soy sauce way too long. We should have grab it off the other table. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has four stars.  The salmon and hamachi were grayish the rolls were not well assembled. The fish tasted strong so it wasn't that fresh.  The servers were very pleasant but you couldn't talk to a chef even at the bar.  I would avoid for sure."}
{"text":"The Aria-O was one of the best rolls I've ever eaten. All the flavors just meshed so well together, even the mango. Highly impressed."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service spectacular. Save room for dessert too!
The green tea cheesecake is delicious and the authentic chefs that prepared the sushi made very good suggestions that we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Open late night with best sushi roll 
Front to Bellagio hotel, inside of Paris hotel. Lots of things look at on the way interior is awesome. Its pretty small restaurant hard to find, but they have best food with service by Jane"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. We got to sit and watch people walk by while eating the excellent grilled skewers of scallops, sea bass, and asparagus. Or server Teresa was attentive and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Fishes are fresh. Atmosphere is very relax. Enjoyed the meal. 
??????????????????"}
{"text":"Food was great and the best service! Our sushi chef Nikko was amazing!! We'll be coming back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in Paris hotel. We ordered the eel avocado roll, beef bulgogi bento, and the creamy seafood udon. All were very delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool sushi!! Fantastic ramen!! The best service!!! We've got the warm welcome. You must be here once you're in vegas."}
{"text":"This is hands the best Korean food I have ever had! And Teresa was so helpful and patient with my many questions! I got the shrimp bowl with noodles and chimichura sauce! Here is a picture after I mixed the bowl!"}
{"text":"Great food and Yui gave great service! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food tasted great. The service was excellent, the waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. The music was ok. The place is nice overall. The sake samplers were awesome, I say they are a must!"}
{"text":"Got into Vegas late on a Friday night and was too tired to venture out, so decided to check out the food options between Bally's and the Paris hotels. Came across this place and decided to try. There's lots of exposure and foot traffic here. It was moderately busy. Lighting and ambience had a hipster feel. Service was below par. They all just wanted to stand around and talk to each other. They have one side that's sushi and one side that's skewers and bowls. We order sushi and skewers. Had the shrimp ceviche, surf and turf roll, king crab roll, pork belly, bass skewer, and the salmon collar. The shrimp ceviche was horrible. The shrimps texture was rubbery. I tried to eat it...I really did, but it had no flavor. The surf and turf and king crab rolls weren't very much better. Rice was dry and fell apart. The pork belly had a good flavor, but the meat was over cooked, so it was dry. The bass skewer was quite tasty. It had a citrus miso glaze that was good. The best part was the salmon collar. It was cooked perfect. The flavor was slightly salty but sweet. If it weren't for the salmon, I'd probably give this place one star for what I got for the price I paid."}
{"text":"I had such a good time here tonight for an early dinner with my family. Our server Sandra was so attentive and really nice. She made the dining experience a lot more  enjoyable. The food also made our dinner memorable. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I ordered the specialty rolls and it definitely did not taste good.  Expected more from a restaurant in this casino."}
{"text":"Great bento box and sushi!!    And the house salad..... yep I got 2!!!     And the servers are also amazing"}
{"text":"A great hidden gem inside the Paris resort, a great selection and good quality for any late night cravings. Sushi, bento, ramen, and udon can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing bento boxes. Super friendly staff and the sushi looked really yummy. Will be wanting to come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious. Spicy tuna roll was BOMB. We got a second, just because. Free desert if you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Yui is so awesome! Loved her! The food is super good! The portions are nice size. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome cozy place in Las Vegas! So delicious and funny team! Return next time just this place!"}
{"text":"The food were ok. Their salad was alittle salty for me. Melissa was our waitress and she was super nice and an excelent waitress!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with the wifey and we left full & happy! 
.
The sekushi roll was amazing! The smokiness of the foie gras was a surprise and a welcome one. The flavor profile was very unique and combined with very fresh tuna that melts in your mouth made this our favorite roll of the lunch! We would come back just for this.
.
The kimono roll was a very close second, as the combo of he spicy tuna and nice crunch added to a change in pace of texture from the sekushi roll that led for a debate of which was our favorite.  Again, the cuts of fish were very fresh.
.
We tried two pieces of the Otoro, $15 each, but worth it with all its melt in your mouth goodness.
.
Service was great.  Very friendly, prompt and courteous.  Thank you Weethara for a very pleasant lunch experience.  We will definitely come back to try some more rolls!"}
{"text":"the fish was not fresh... soups and edmame was very salty food was pretty salty in general. Didnt feel like any of the food was good at alll."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant.  The menu look legit.  We ordered the kampachi tiradito ,the yellowtail tiradito, spicy garlic edamame and yellowtail jalapeño roll.  The kampachi was suppose to have truffles and did not.  The yellowtail wasn't yellowtail and the roll was horrible.  The edamame was ok and the service was very slow.  We did order sake and that was good.  Maybe it's because it's new but I would not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Best sushi my GF and I have ever had! The specialty rolls are well worth the price and service was good. We always use Sekushi as our \"gauge\" of other sushi restaurants and none have been able to top it thus far."}
{"text":"This place was the only sushi place open late. It's 12:40am and I just had some pretty clean sushi. It doesn't match up to nobu or sushisamba-- both Vegas favorites of mine, but yeah, it's open and better than pizza."}
{"text":"Very Delicious My 3rd Time Here within 2 wks. The Skillets is Also Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really, really liked this place! So much that my mom wanted to come twice during our stay in LV! 

Let me start by saying The service was fantastic! When your drink would get low, they were on top of making sure to refill it. Everyone worked well together to make sure customers were treated great! 

The food...YUM! Let's see in total during both trips we ordered the following:
Miso Soup: probably the best miso soup I've had! We ordered seconds on this. So fresh, delicious and perfect start to a perfect meal! 

King Cali roll & shrimp roll: didn't love the Cali roll but the shrimp roll didn't stand a chance! FYI they are super tiny rolls, so use this as an appetizer. 

Beef bulgogi bento box: very very good! Well cooked beef slices, with large amounts! Flavor on point! Bento box comes with soup, salad, chicken egg roll and rice. I enjoyed this way too much! 

Salmon bento box: Salmon had great flavor and was cooked well. My mom loved it! 

Ebi don bowl: this is a rice bowl, with an over easy (extremely easy) egg, onions and shoyu sauce with 2 fried shrimp. I came on a Friday and couldn't eat meat, so I got this. Looking at it, I was disgusted because of the runny egg, but I mixed it up and gave it a try...and glad I did because I loved it. Had a perfect sweet flavor because of the sauce, extremely good and worth it! Just wish it had more shrimp. 

Gyoza: the sauce made these soooo amazing! I let them soak up the juice before eating them and I still crave the wonderful flavor!"}
{"text":"2.11.16: I was really craving for ramen thinking that they will have it here. Well they do have it but not at the time that we came. They have a late night that is different from their regular menu starting at 10pm. I was too lazy to go elsewhere so we stayed. 

Located in Paris Hotel we sat near the front entrance. It was pretty quiet at 11pm. I guess everyone is out and about clubbing while I'm just hungry. I wanted something not too greasy so I opt to order their Rainbow Roll called Sekushi Rainbow. In this roll it's actually real crab, came with alaskan crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail as the protein. I order fresh wasabi on the side. To my surprise it didn't look like fresh wasabi. As wasbi is a root and if grated it would look like garlic consistency more than what we got. Maybe they mix it with other stuff? It was different and good. 

It's hard to say I'm a fan here as I only ate one dish. For $22 I think it's priced pretty high for a roll. I rather have imitation crab meat lol. 

Need a place that opens until 1am that is not fast food? This might be it."}
{"text":"The food came out fast and not bad but not very good. 
We had Wagyu beef skewer- good but overcook
Foie gras- good
Uni- good
Spicy tuna roll- OK
King Cali roll- Ok
Chicken teriyaki bento-good- the kids love the glaze
panko shrimp bento- good
Surf n turf roll- bad- mushy rice very mushy blah mushy 
Sekushi Sashimi- good- fresh
Hamachi kama- very good and the biggest we saw 
Japanese miso ramen- ok full of bean sprout
I will get the sashimi and the dinner plate/bento if we ever go back but I'll stay away from the rolls unless it was an off night for them. When it comes to sushi not only the fish plays an important role but the rice. If the rice is not right it just throws everything off."}
{"text":"Dropped in for some quick sushi and ended up getting one of the best rolls I've ever had! Seriously get the hot spring roll it's crazy good! Great quick service and good food is why I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Food. Good Staff. Totally overpriced even for happy hour, but hey, they probably have some monster rent to deal with. Go out to Spring Mountain Road, and I guarantee you'll find better deals on Sushi. However, If you're in the mood for Japanese in Vegas and too lazy to leave the strip, Paris has at least 3 little Japanese restaurants all right next to each other, and this is one of them. Basically what I'm saying is, come down to the Paris and you'll find something you'll like, maybe not here, be certainly nearby."}
{"text":"Been walking past this place for a few Vegas visits & finally made it in & it was happy hour. I had the edamame, tuna sashimi,  maki roll & 2 Japanese beers. The sashimi & sushi were fresh & the beer ice cold.The entire bill was under $20. I don't remember the last time that happened, let alone in Vegas, on the strip & for sushi but it did. I can't wait to come back for a visit to my new fave sushi bar on the strip."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmm yummy sushi.  Craving sushi and this hit the spot.  Everything from the kumomono oysters to the nigiri was spot on.  Rolls were filling and temura was on point.  Staff very friendly!! We will be back when in town"}
{"text":"4.5 stars? Not even. First, I hate when restaurants call themselves \"Japanese\" yet have Korean dishes. A real Japanese restaurant doesn't serve Korean food. Food was just ok. I ordered chirashi. It came with 4 pieces of fish, two pieces of fried egg, a little salmon roe and a shiso leaf. Rice was cold and unseasoned. Fish quality was ok. Not a $22 dish."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here last minute, and I was glad that we did. As is typical for Las Vegas, a person can't eat for less than $15, but this restaurant isn't a whole lot more than that.

We were seated quickly, and the dim sum cart came around pretty quickly. I have this sticky rice and it was very tasty. One of my companions had a pork bun and couldn't stop raving about it.

For the main course I ordered the vegetarian noodles, and they were okay. Probably not something I would order again. However my partner ordered the ginger chicken and I ate half of his plate. That is definitely something you would want to order if you're there.

Service was good and timely, and I would definitely eat there again the next time I stay at the Paris. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Asian food."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in this side area of NV!! Will definitely be coming back here again. Service was awesome and food was soooo gooood!!!"}
{"text":"I'm truly shocked this place has more than 1 star. This is hands down the worst excuse for sushi I have ever eaten in my life. The salmon skin roll was smothered in eel sauce, and the salmon eggs had a fishy odor. Nothing was fresh, nor was it prepared properly. The service wasn't great. Please don't go here."}
{"text":"OK fish in the desert.

Not as over-priced as other sushi restaurants on the LV Strip, Sekushi does a pretty good job. Nigiri sushi is priced by the piece ($5-$8 depending on the fish), instead of by the pair as in normal sushi establishments, and as a result you end up paying 2x for your nigiri. Rolls are $15+, and are \"slimmer\" than normal.

Fish quality is as one would expect in LV:  not straight from Tsukiji in Tokyo, but not spoiled either.

Service is friendly and efficient for the most part.  Although the waitress did forget to put in the order for one of our rolls, she remedied the situation quickly.

One drawback is there is only a limited selection of premium sakes and a few types of beer.

Locals would surely know of better sushi destinations in LV, but for visitors with a sushi craving Sekushi fits the bill."}
{"text":"Doesn't do deep fried after 10pm, uneven rolls, sushi/sashimi extremely expensive charged by piece, underserved, barely serve wasabi and charge $3 for extra (ridiculous), didn't inform tea is per person and charged extra."}
{"text":"Must order Ariao roll, very good and well balanced. Service was good and food tasty. Only complaint was food took awhile to come out, other than that it was a nice meal. I would come back again. Price was fair for sushi in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Kitchen is not busy, chefs are not busy but the Ramen is not cooked here and coming from restaurant next door. Not happy why I had to wait without explanation. Overall service not as expected but no complaints to the crew because they are exceptionally hard working."}
{"text":"Glad to have some thing authentic at a reasonable price .
The Chirashi don tasted good. Felt satisfying"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible quality food and service. They brought out the wrong sashimi and yet didn't fix the issue. We told them they brought out the wrong fish and it was not fresh with a piece still on the plate she took it away and didn't even replace it with the correct sashimi then attempts to charge us for it. False advertising they say you can get an assortment of 3 tiradito or ceviche for $25 I even confirmed it meant what I thought yet they fully charged us for the tiradito. Also, I get it truffles are not in season but don't put it on your menu and forget the truffle oil after the fact we already ate the sashimi. We had to keep asking for a server they left all the dirty dishes on the table the entire duration of us there and no refills on water. The fish was not fresh. The only good thing was the sake. Even the spicy garlic edamame didn't have enough garlic. Ashamed the food and service are both bad because the atmosphere is incredible."}
{"text":"I ordered Nakaochi(Tuna berry)
Tuna roll, crab roll, salmon skin rolls. Quality of sushi is high so I recon and you to come here. ?????? ??? ???????? ????????"}
{"text":"There was no wait time and everyone working here was friendly. Our waitress messed up our order twice (reason for star deduction) but the sushi and shrimp was amazing. We ordered the Sekushi Lobster Roll and Shrimp Cocktail. We were also able to try Mochi Ice Cream (Mango and Green Tea) from the Yelp check in. I would definitely come back here again. Everyone's Plates around us look great as well- and edamame was given to us to start."}
{"text":"Great food really enjoyed yourselves, our server was very personable and food was outstanding, I highly recommend this place, we stay at Paris very often, and are we deafly coming back here very soon"}
{"text":"Best Noodles I haven't eat . I recommend everybody when you go to Vegas 
 You should try ones"}
{"text":"Great place for a nice meal with friendly service. The food came relatively quick! Rolls were made very fast. As soon as we finished ordering, 2 minutes later the plates were hitting the table. I think the cut rolls were very small. It would be nice if they were bigger. The nigiri sushi is only one piece so I felt disappointed when I got it as I am used to getting two pieces at other restaurants. The manager was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Sekushi is a great spot! If you are staying in the Paris or Bally's you must try it, I find myself here at every stay. 
On my most recent trip we stopped in for a couple rolls at happy hour. The shrimp tempura roll and the eel & avocado roll were simple yet delicious. Ive also had the oyster shooter on previous trips and recommend that as well. 
The service is always great, its very cute inside, and theres not a bad seat in the place. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great sushi, I like their fish,it was so fresh. The server is very kind and all way smile when she is serving."}
{"text":"We were starving after walk a couple hours in Las Vegas Strip,then we look for a Japanese restaurant close by.finally,we found one in Paris Hotel.we decided to give a try,we were satisfied with the food and the services,specially Novi she did a good job,she always smile,nice and take care our table.i think she deserves to get raise.because she really did good job,for sure we would come back."}
{"text":"This review is based on the robata section. I don't know if it's because we were there near closing but the food did not taste fresh. Instead it was over cooked and hard. The portions are small and expensive for what you get but it's expected since it's Vegas but I wouldn't mind if he quality of the food we're good. This was not the case. They did have a good buy one get one free sake special. Maybe the other two sections were better but I didn't get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Menu is great and service is even better! Tina was our first server and Chika was our second. Both really great servers. Had so much fun! Try the Aria O' and Kimono! You won't be disappointed. Sincerely a little Asian girl"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing!! And the panko shrimp bento is wonderful!! This will be my go to place every time I visit."}
{"text":"Come with friends for dinner, and they us put at the table right away. Tried beef steam bun, and was delicious. Roles was mazing, aria'o especially."}
{"text":"Yum Yum!! Good and fresh sushi.  Salmon was very good, nice fat content. Service was also very good for the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Horrible awful disgusting disaster faux BS sushi in the most expensive city west of NYC. This is a HUGE embarrassment for Paris and Vegas.  Shishito peppers were on fire  and in an a very BAD way. Sushi quality was  positively SUB PAR. My stomach was aching for 24 hours after and I thought I was going to die. 
 Employees were useless and not because they didn't speak English, they just didn't give a"}
{"text":"Very good service! And food! The miso soup was the best. Yui, our server were friendly and cute. They gave us 4 free desserts for a party of 6!"}
{"text":"Great! They have red bean ice cream which makes me happy.  And were able to accommodate us last minute."}
{"text":"We like it here! Very nice food and ambiance. We ordered bento. Kind of pricey but the place is nice!"}
{"text":"This is a small Japanese restaurant located inside of the Paris hotel. The sushi prices were reasonable (especially for Vegas) and the rolls we ordered were delicious. My favorite was the sekushi rainbow roll. The tempura batter on the shrimp was also excellent, not too much and just the right temperature and texture. We picked up a 20% off coupon at the check in station as well, so look for it! Sorry no pictures, I was too hungry."}
{"text":"Good sushi but definitely is overpriced. $18 - $23 for artistic rolls on the smallish size. $19 for udon noodles.  The best of all is that they calculate tip based on tax and recommend 20, 25 and 30% gratuity! Lol keep up these awesome business practices and watch your customers disappear like the dodo bird!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant in December when I visited but didn't get the chance to check it out. I'm so glad I finally got to on my most recent visit! We had an early dinner here and were seated at the sushi bar. You receive complimentary edamame with your meal. They have a large variety of sushi as well as small and large plates. We both ordered bento boxes, salmon for me and bulgogi for my boyfriend. He also ordered kirin draft beer and said it was good. The bento boxes include your choice of meat (they also have teriyaki chicken and panko shrimp), salad with peanut dressing, a chicken egg roll, and white rice. You also receive miso soup as an appetizer. The soup was really good but the SALMON was the star. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with the skin on and the salmon itself was so fresh! It reminded me of what my mom makes for me at home. I sampled my boyfriend's bulgogi and it was also yummy. We also ordered pork gyoza and those were good as well. The egg roll and salad were just okay. For dessert we shared the mango and red bean mochi and they were a sweet and refreshing ending to our meal. In short, the food and service were very good! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi / steak house in town, servers/ staff is very friendly and don't have us wait a long time . Sushi is always fresh and really good , I love the environment there is very welcoming . If you haven't tried sekushi your missing out or probably still stuck in 2017 !"}
{"text":"The ratings are extremely deceiving here. I ordered the creamy seafood udon while my friends ordered the ramen and a few rolls. I thought the udon was okay until I got sick later that evening. Ramen was also disappointing  as it was way too salty and the noodles were still stuck together when it was served to us... As for the rolls, these were okay but very pricy. To top it off, everyone in my party of six got sick after eating here."}
{"text":"Attentive servers and the best food for my dollar during our entire stay in Vegas. We ordered the wagyu beef skewers, tuna tartare, tuna with foie gras, and the daily salmon roll. All of them were fantastic but the foie gras and tuna (their namesake Sekushi roll) really stole the show. An absolute must-order, but don't be shocked when you only get three pieces!"}
{"text":"We are here while staying at the Paris. I had the salmon avocado roll and mochi ice cream. The food was decisions and the staff was very nice. They even offered to get us water to go before our night out :)"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance, and the Japanese decor and they had some cool kill bill wallpaper. Everything tastes fresh and for a great price point. The staff was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Overly hyped sushi place located at the Paris Casino. Let's begin by saying that the staff was not at all attentive nor was I given any adequate utensils until I asked for them. I as well had to ask for soy sauce after my food was delivered and that took a bit of time while my food stood there aimlessly waiting to be eaten. 

Now the food. Well let me sum it up this way. Your local cheap sushi place will offer better quality sushi and overall a better experience. I don't and I mean DONT recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Good sushi bar on the strip. Really enjoyed the otoro sushi plus the Aria roll. Hot sake was bomb as always as well. Would come back for sushi for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4-star reviews. Very mediocre food for the expensive price. We ordered the lobster roll but could not find any lobster except for the tip of a claw in one of the pieces. Waitress also forgot part of our order and then tried to charge us for it. Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"good food, reasonably priced for the area and served Yui was lovely and helpful :) also great cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, small rolls.  Sekushi is located inside Paris Paris.  Service was good.  Food taste was average.  I cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Really great sushi place!
Here's what we ordered and my comments:

Wakame Salad - probably the best I've ever had and I order it everywhere!
Aria O roll - absolutely amazing. The masago is crunchy, the cilantro is amazing, the spice is just right!
Oyster Shooter - probably the best I've ever had and I order it everywhere
Spicy Garlic Edamame - this is seriously spicy!  (Too spicy for us)
Surf N Turf roll - very, very good!
Green Mussels - good, a little on the spicy side.

One constructive criticism...the servers should be mindful about reaching across in front of a patron...we had 3 different people reach across in front of us during our meal."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here. Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. I had them build me a custom roll from scratch and the chef nailed it... will be back for sure... All the way from Texas"}
{"text":"This place was amazing it was late so we only had about 15 mins to order but it was still enough time to order. I had a spicy tuna hand roll and the green mussels. Green mussels were amazing. They were spicy but so good. My friend had the salmon avocado roll and she said it was one of the better sushi she has had. I would give them a 4 star because all they have is Pepsi products but the food and server were to good to give anything less than a five star"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and the whole crew thought it was pretty amazing.  It's expensive but that's it.   I ate a piece with a raw quail egg on top and it was amazing!   We also had gyoza and the Baja crisp roll all was great.   Service was on point too!   We didn't have a wait for a table for 4 on a Friday at noon."}
{"text":"Great service, average sushi. 

The waitress was nice, friendly and attentative. People cleared out stuff quickly as we finished our food.

Got the salmon skin roll and the hot spring roll. Taste was fine but presentation was boring.

Same goes with the pork katsu bento.
Katsu was done well but the bento itself was boring. 

Nothing made me want to come back here.

They made me write a review before I got my check in offer."}
{"text":"Nikko was awesome!  Created some great items!  Highly recommend.  Great sushi and overall service"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of trying new sushi spots but this place was amazing. The service is top notch and the sushi was amazing. Yellowtail jalapeño roll was delicious, traditos were yummy and the pork upon was perfect. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We were walking inside the Paris hotel at around 10:30pm when we came across this place. So we decided to give it a go. We were sat down immediately by the sushi bar and it wasn't too packed. We were given a \"Late Night Menu\" that was only available from 10pm-1am The prices for the sushi were around $18-25. 

For starters we had the Kumamoto Oysters ($4 Each) which were already prepared for us and they were so good! We ended up ordering more. Now for sushi, I decided to try the Hot Spring Roll ($18) which had the baked scallop, crab meat, cream cheese, masago, and spicy mayo. It was a good sushi roll but I didn't think it was excellent.

At the bar you're able to see the sushi being made right in front of you with fresh ingredients. We were talking to one of the chefs and he was really nice and had us try different types of sauces. Now don't forget to check into yelp to get a free cheesecake or devil's pie. They didn't have any of those available so they offered me a Mochi which was nice. So I got the mango mochi and it was good!"}
{"text":"Good service. Location is very convenient, between Ballys and Paris casino. It is in between the casinos. The sashimi we had was good, the service was good as well. I would come back if I was craving sushi late at night."}
{"text":"While spending a long weekend in Las Vegas, my daughter and her friend were craving crepes and I wanted sushi, so I grabbed a roll to go from Sekushi.  The hostess was very nice and took my order for a Rainbow Roll ($22) and a green salad.  Being gluten-free, she told me that the chef could make me a GF salad dressing for my salad.  She also told me that the Rainbow Roll was a large roll, which I was happy to hear given the $22 price tag.  When I got my food, I carried it over to the the table where my daughter was and upon opening it, could not believe how tiny the Rainbow Roll was!  6 tiny pieces in a tiny container.  It also lacked much flavor.  The salad was just spinach & lettuce leaves, nothing else, and the dressing that the chef made for me was pretty much just GF soy sauce with a little ginger in it.  Such a disappointing & expensive meal, for what I got!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh edamame at your table as soon as you walk in. Very authentic sushi. Full of flavor! Eel roll was ok but the Yakuza roll was delicious!! Also the King Cali crab roll taste very well."}
{"text":"Today we  lunch at Sekushi Sushi in the Paris Hotel/Las Vegas. The food was absolutely delicious! We tried an assorted sushi plate, shrimp tempura and a salmon avocado roll. What a treat!our server Julie was attentive, friendly and professional!"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. ;) staff are friendly.  I highly recommend aria o, surf and turf and rainbow. Their house sake is amaaazing too. We will definitely be back soon. We love sekushi very much. Our server yui is great. matt is nice too."}
{"text":"The service is hit and miss as far as speed, but it is generally good. The sushi is excellent, but with an order of around 15 individual pieces we paid $106 after tip and tax. That is pricey in my mind. You should definitely try the fragois sushi.  It is $9 for a single piece, but delicious."}
{"text":"Our group was craving some sushi while we were on the strip.  Found this place hidden away in Paris.  No regrets.  Quality choices & service, and also a great playlist to set the mood.  Tina & Chika were amaze and supplemented the experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this restaurant for my 30th birthday, and it did not disappoint!  The tuna, salmon, octopus, yellowtail and hamachi Kama were some of the best we have ever had! This was a great place with fresh sushi and great service. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Service - 4 stars
Food - 3 1/3 starts

The place is located inside the Paris hotel, so obviously, price is much higher than the already expensive Japanese cruisine which ranges higher about 30 - 50%.  

Umi shooter - $8
Oyster shooter - $7
Sashim - 12 pieces - $39
Aria  roll - $18
Rainbow roll - $18
Hamachi Kama - $18
Hot sake - $15
Hot tea -$4.5

Is it worth it?  Let's just say, its the experience.  The presentation of the sashim was nice.  Fish were thinly sliced with two pieces that were questionable whether they were the natural color of the fish or whether they were turning into different stages.  Not daring to try.

 The aria roll was nicely rolled up in a skinny roll. The texture of the rice is mixed well, the filling is made with real fresh crab meat with maybe lightly salted, as you can taste the freshness of the crab meat.  Topping was salmon cerviche with a creamy sriracha aioli that added the heat to the roll along with the sesame coating on the outside of the roll.  That was my favorite dish. The fish and shrimp on the rainbow roll again thinly strategically placed on the roll perfectly fresh.  The shooters were interesting shots with heavy sake, soy sauce, raw quail egg, and chopped green onion.  Need to chute it down as fast as you can . Hamachi Kama is ok, it would have been better if it has more grilled mark that brings out the chard taste.  Again, it's all about the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh sushi!  The waitress was friendly!  Bulgogi Beef was wonderful!  
My sashimi was so great!  Quick service!  Only came for the weekend, but I will be back later tonight!"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian cuisines in Vegas! The seafood udon was amazing! Great service, bento boxes, and sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi on the Strip located inside of the Paris hotel. It's a tiny place so expect it to be packed at peak times. The sushi is comparable to some of the upscale sushi restaurants at a lower price, but I still think it's pricey...and I'm comparing this to Chicago and NYC standards. I love how we received complementary edamame. We had the Sekushi lobster, Kimono, and Aria O. The kimono is my least favorite. Still good, but I think it's the sauce. I prefer a creamier sauce rather than the balsamic. The Aria O is one of the best rolls I have ever had. There is a crunch component which is really unique. Don't know what it is, but it's fantastic. Wait service is good here too. Since it's a small place, they were all attentive to everyone's needs."}
{"text":"Came to this sushi place for my sister's birthday. I wanted to take her somewhere nice. This was the worst 70 dollar meal I have ever had. The size of their sushi is pathetic. We were wowed. Sushi from gas stations is bigger. 10+ dollars for the smallest rolls I have ever seen. The quality of the fish was hit and miss. I understand Vegas is expensive, but I went thinking I'd gladly pay 75+ dollars for amazing sushi. The reviews are from people that know not what good sushi tastes like. Never again.

Grade: Oh Honey No"}
{"text":"I get why normal sushi eaters don't like this place...it's because the patrons here order cooked dishes versus sashimi or sushi rolls so I think that's why the restaurant doesn't up their sushi game. I got the seaweed salad and the rainbow roll. I could tell with the first bite that the dish wasn't as fresh as a roll from Whole Foods.

Service was attentive and I got my food very quickly. I probably wouldn't come back here unless you are starving (me at the time). Not a must stop sushi stop."}
{"text":"OMG! The most creative and flavorful sushi roll that I have ever had.  I ordered a lobster roll that had avocado and jalapeños, but what really set it apart was it was topped with coriander threads and wrapped in pink soy papper. It was so pretty and delicious- I cant stop thinking about it. The restaurant is located inside the Paris casino.  Large double sided bar, otherwise a small place. Decorated nicely and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Incomparably the best sushi imaginable. I would recommend this place to everyone! I had the Aria-O and it had the perfect amount of spice and heat.  We also had the cheese cake with dried wasabi, definitely well worth it!  Located on the first floor of the Paris!"}
{"text":"Great place to get sushi on the strip! The rolls were so delicious and service was amazing. We really enjoyed our time here"}
{"text":"it was ok sushi. nothing memorable- have had much better salmon nigiri. wasn't expecting the salmon avo roll to be cooked but it was ok. for more than 20$ for a small lunch....small. would give 3 stars if not as expensive. not impressed with reviews that were so positive- not sure why unless gambling & drinking beforehand, lol"}
{"text":"Just had the best experience with sushi chef Nikko. We asked for a special mix of sashimi and he whipped up this amazing dish with a beautiful presentation. Thanks for the great service Nikko!! You deserve recognition!"}
{"text":"Don't let the affordable price fool you! Other reviewers who gave this awful place more than half a star must be the owner, owner's friends and relatives. The kitchen staff are not trained chefs at all. The rice was mushy, completely overcooked. The sushi size is miniaturized, there is zero flavor profile. The sushi pieces were unevenly cut - different height, some were slanted. While the service was good, no service can make up the waste of money and sub-par food quality. By far the worst, the worst restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious gem on the strip! Very yummy bento box and edamame. Very cool set up, and beautiful sushi bar! The waiters are very nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot to people watch and have great sushi and sake.  Located in the Paris Hotel near all of their other restaurants. It's a popular place so if you're in a rush don't even bother."}
{"text":"Hmmm, not a lot of sushi choices. I'm a big fan of salmon rolls and salmon, so I ended up getting the Aria O because that was the closest thing to salmon roll on the menu. It took awhile to get seated even though I was looking at some empty tables, but I ended up walking around and coming back. After we were seated, it took awhile for our server to come back to take our order. The table next to us was seated after us and I overheard the server tell them that they're out of plates and napkins? The sushi is expensive for what it is, and there were way too much things on their rolls."}
{"text":"I always hated reading reviews of people that didn't eat at a restaurant.  But my experience was bad enough to write a review.

Two weeks ago, as we were walking from the casino side; we decided to stop by for lunch.  All we saw was the bar and sat down.  I found it weird that we sat there for 10 minutes and the two guys behind the bar kept looking at us but wouldn't talk.  I wasn't sure if they speak English so decided to go look for a waitress.  As I got up, a lady approached me to tell me that unless I see a hostess, no one will be helping me.  Mind you, you can't see a hostess when you're coming from the casino floor.  I told her that I never saw a hostess, she told me 'good luck getting service'.  Really?  The restaurant was empty and this is how you treat a person?

I was so irritated that I came back after I ate elsewhere to speak to the manager.  The same girl says that the manager isn't in and that I have no reason to complain.  This was so rude!

I took a business card to call in the complaint.  Called couple of times and got hung up on when I asked for the manager.  I didn't raise my voice or tell them that it was regarding a complaint.    

This was such a terrible customer service spot that I wouldn't waste my money here.

If a manager reads this review, you have to manage your staff better.  Your staff is rude!!!"}
{"text":"Solid fish and good price for Vegas strip, but the service and seating are HORRIBLE.  Tables for two are on top of each other.  I mean you have to pull the table out to get into the booth without having your ass knock over a drink on the table next to you.  

The service is even worse.   With a tiny table the severs bring out your courses with no where to put the dishes. They just stand there and look at you, like you have to grab the plates from them and figure out how to fit everything on the table.  They run food without knowing what table ordered it.   Several times a runner brought a dish to our area and just yelled out its name...\"spicy tuna roll\" ...3 of the 6 tables that ordered it now have to figure out who gets it.  

What is it with Asians and horrible serving/customer service?"}
{"text":"Sushi was really tasty. The presentation was beautiful. The music is really loud, so it's hard to have a conversation at the table. Food was good, though."}
{"text":"Had creamy udon and bulbogi bento. Not worth the price. It was each 19$. However, I wouldn't order it even if it was half the price. I assume this place has 4 stars because of rolls and sushi? I don't think I would come back, though. Good service."}
{"text":"We order a spicy tuna signature roll and a tempera combo. The sushi is just average taste and is a little bit small. Tempura is pretty crispy with good dipping. The only ridiculous thing is that the tea costs 4.5 bucks...  Above all price is quite high but maybe it's because in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located just past the casino area at Paris as you make your way onto the shopping area...

Here's what we had:

Edamamae:  Complimentary; very nice of them
Japanese gyoza:  Pork dumplings; very good
Kimono roll:  Spicy tuna plus other delicious ingredients; very good
Chirashi:  I won't order this again; this is a very tough dish to make and probably my fault for ordering this at Vegas hotel

Good experience overall"}
{"text":"1. Very attentive service, and very friendly 
2. Reasonably priced
3. Excellent sushi (I had the Rainbow Roll)
4. My wife had the Miso Ramen = delicious!!
5. Matcha cheesecake - very good

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great dinner spot on the strip! Super easy and great selection. Ramen and sushi was good."}
{"text":"This was the perfect restaurant to check out before a night out! Great service, good food, can't ask for much more. Definitely try the salmon bento box if you want a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner!  Fresh ingredients and beautifully plated! If you want good food and not the usual strip restaurants then this is the bet. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good place to have a quick and easy food fix after hangover, other than that nothing is really exceptional about this place and overall tastes are rather neutral and in some case inexistant."}
{"text":"Great service! Food delicious!  Enjoy this place at the Paris Hotel!  Very clean and lots of choices.beer and wine also served."}
{"text":"Unexpected find. There's only one ramen soup dish on the menu, which was off-putting since I was craving ramen, and thought that it was added as an afterthought to the sushi-bar. But it did NOT disappoint. Delicious ramen, perfect texture noodle in a deep-flavoured broth. Quality sushi - \"Aria O\" signature roll - a must-try. Would definitely come again, this trip."}
{"text":"My girls and I saw this place on yelp, and they had good reviews, so we wanted to give it a chance. The interior is cute and the servers are attentive. We got the Hot Spring, Aria-O, and Negihama. We really enjoyed the Aria-O the most."}
{"text":"Really nice personnel and good foods! 
They have the best restaurant and people! Come here and enjoy eating!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered udon soup and salmon bento box for lunch. Both were delicious and well made would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, from their service, to their food, and the atmosphere. It was a really relaxed place to get some sushi. 

The employees were so nice and always made sure to check on how we were doing. 

The food was food, I really recommend the sliders and the spicy garlic edamame for appetizers. I had the surf n turf roll, and spicy tuna roll. Those were delicious and filling! My bf had the pork ramen (you can request for them to make it spicy) and he really enjoyed it! I tasted his ramen and I can agree that it was one of the best ramens I've had! 

This place is great if you're craving some late night Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dining experience here.

Our server was extremely courteous and friendly.

Food came fast and was delicious!

The oyster shooter was insanely good.  We had spicy tuna and salmon skin rolls.  Both were great.  

I ordered a single pacific oyster, it was one heck of an oyster.

We ordered the hot springs and it was off the hook.  It came out HOT and delicious.  

Totally plan on coming back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our sushi. The Surf n Turf and Hot Spring rolls were delicious. Our waitress Melissa was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I was bamboozled by all of the high reviews on Yelp. I came here this past weekend with high hopes of this being a great sushi/fusion spot. I was highly disappointed.

This place is located inside of the Paris Hotel and Casino. That should have been my first clue. It's literally located on the side of this wanna be alley way mimicking Paris streets. Huh....

The inside was not appealing at all. Very tiny. Small little booths with a center sushi bar. The walls were covered in some weird graffiti type of art. The vibe here is not a sexy one. Very casual and unromantic. 

Service was pretty good. Food came out fast. Very attentive.

As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:


Edamame - Way too salty!

Seaweed salad - tiny portion....

Sliders - Not bad...needed to add ketchup because it was very bland. 

Steak in a Bao bun - This was delicious!! Pretty much Bulgogi Beef in a Bao bun. Soooo good!!

Yellowtail Taco - Way too much Spicy Mayo!! 

6 different speciality sushi rolls - All of them were pretty good. But very tiny rolls, and each cost around $25 a roll. Way too expensive for what you got.

Creamy Udon Seafood Soup - This was really good. Tasted like mac and cheese. 

Overall - this place was way too expensive for lack luster ambiance and small portioned food. There are way better places out there."}
{"text":"Great service and food! The gyoza was tasted great and had a crispy outside. The surf and turf was totally worth it and that raw beef was very tasty. My mom even said the miso soup was legit!"}
{"text":"It is great sushi restaurant. Our server was nice and food was delicious as well. Good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, Sandra took great care of us!
Food, not too exciting!!!
My first Miso was warm, not Hot like it should be 
My California roll was ok, the end was missing avocado 
Shrimp tempura roll was ok
Eel roll was great !!!
Second miso soup was hot and great !!!
Green tea was good !"}
{"text":"The creamy seafood udon had rich flavor and very good! Service was nice and we liked our lunch here overall"}
{"text":"At $6-$8 for ONE piece of nigiri (instead of 2 piece as per usual), I expected the quality of the fish to be mind blowing. I ordered yellow tail which is something I use as a benchmark for a sushi restaurant because the taste degrades really fast if it's not fresh... and they're yellow tail was very mediocre, Super fishy and bitter. Fresh yellow tail tastes like butter. 
The rest of the food was good, but the fact that they charge double the price, for mediocre nigiri sushi really turned me off. 
Their specialty roles were $20+
this place should be classified as \"$$$\", not \"$$\" with these prices, if that was the case and I wasn't caught off guard on a night I wasn't tying to drop a bill on dinner, I wouldn't be so upset."}
{"text":"If your lucky enough, Nikko will be your chef. We sat at the bar and he took great care of us!
Definitely gonna stop by next time I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor to Sekushi. Found it on yelp.

FOOD: My friend and I ordered chicken teriyaki bento boxes. Each comes with chicken, steamed rice, salad, and a vegetable egg roll. It was a good portion and the food was delicious. We both particularly enjoyed the egg roll which was crispy and flavorful. All of the food was served at a desired temperature. The cheesecake stole the chose. Incredibly creamy and just all around delightful! 
SERVICE: We visited on a Saturday at noon. We were greeted and seated within minutes. The service was fast and efficient. The servers work as a team to execute orders with high quality and speed. Our server Weethara was friendly and helpful. We waited a minimal amount for our food and had our drinks and complementary edamame to hold us over.  
AMBIANCE: They have an upbeat fun vibe. It's noisy because it's near the shops but manageable. Casual.
QUALITY/VALUE: This place is designated $$; I agree. It's reasonable. Good value if you're looking for something quick on the strip and craving Japanese."}
{"text":"Ordered hamachi Kama and it was delicious. Miso soup was fresh, too. Definitely would come back next time when we are in town."}
{"text":"I love sushi anytime I can get it. My friend and I were trying to find affordable sushi before the Britney concert (you know how pricey Vegas can be)... We both got two rolls, I got a miso soup and she got fried rice and we both spent less than $30! They also gave us complimentary edamame. The only thing I didn't like was the spicy mayo; it was sour tasting."}
{"text":"i was hunting for food in tge strip, finally i found this japanese place inside paris, so excited . decided to try out, excellent .. the server name novi .. was help me out a lot.. explained to me patienly, smile.. friendly .. love it, overall experience beyond amazing.. highly recommended .. will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best quality sushi I've had in Las Vegas. The Ariao roll was my absolute Favorite. The have a great selection of sake. I don't understand the negative reviews of the service, Yui was our server and she was very attentive and was able to offer menu advice. The only negative is that that music is loud."}
{"text":"Overall decent service and good rolls. Food is overpriced and not worth the $$. Highlights recommended by the waitress were the Surf n Turf roll and the Aria roll. Honestly to be in Vegas this place is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent Service. Sushi, Rolls and oysters shooter are delicious. Must visit restaurant if you are on the Las Vegas Strip"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sushi place for dinner during our last night in Vegas. Came upon this place through Yelp and decided to make a last minute reservation.  This is a cute little sushi bar located across from the guests' elevators in Paris Hotel. 

The wagyu skewer was my favorite thing on the menu, the meat melted in your mouth.  We ended placing another order of it because it was so delicious. Some of my other favorites were the Kumamoto oysters and the NegiToro roll, the latter was super soft and absolutely delicious. 

On the downside, the grilled butter scallops was overcooked and a bit tough. The sashimi sampler was average, the presentation was beautiful, but the fish themselves were hit or miss, i.e. loved the mackerel but disliked the snapper. 

Overall, a great option to have a casual sushi dinner, service was attentive (our waitress was Yui) and efficient."}
{"text":"I ordered sashimi 12. It's really fresh! (In pic)

I do not recommend ordering their sushi cut roll. It's $6~$12, nothing special, super small size and the rice taste old.

But the service was good, and also I got a cheese cake with mucha on it which is really tasty."}
{"text":"Went last year when it first opened in December. Stayed at Paris it right bear the elevators. This time went twice in May.. I sit at the counter in front of the chefs preparing food. Soft bun with steak great. Always get different sushi fresh watch them make it. Nico one of the chefs very friendly talks to ne while working.
Hostess and servers attentive. Open late."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like buffet, so we stopped and took a chance.. am I glad we did!! My wife ordered the Kimono roll and loved it. I ordered 6 pc. Sashimi plate and was not disappointed, the everything was fresh and prepared correctly!! We will be back before heading home!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and awesome service! They're still working on their full bar (liquor) but were very accommodating with requests. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the rolls here it is very good and unique. The Chirashi Don good too. The fish tastes very fresh and the edamame is served on the house. Melissa provided great service too."}
{"text":"Best meal we have had in Vegas. Melissa gave us excellent service!  We arrived and asked for her recommendations since we had never been here before. Everything she told us was phenomenal. Try the Aria O roll with the gyoza to start!! Will definitely be coming back on our next trip."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here to eat! Super friendly service! Thank you Novi for your great conversation and nice smile!! A+++ service!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly attentive staff.  Great food!  We accidentally dropped one of the most expensive rolls on the floor and they replaced it for free.  Seaweed salad was great. Go with the Kimono roll or the spicy tuna roll!  Our server was Nami and Novi"}
{"text":"Good otoro . But terrible service and long wait ... you pay alot of money for what they say should be sexy \"sekushi\" . More like overated. The sushi is the star."}
{"text":"Really great option for some authentic food. The skewers were a bit small but overall the food was excellent. Meat was all tasty, tofu was really good. Great little option if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.. definitely enjoyed the saki and appetizers..if I could give this place 6 stars I would just because of Naomi!!"}
{"text":"We are here and I here while staying at the Paris. The California roll was delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place but service is absolutely terrible. As much as I like it I will not return even though I'm at this hotel monthly 
Food is not brought out at a timely manner and even when the place is empty no one wants to serve you. I had food made incorrectly and there was no desire to make it right. 

Second visit on same trip was even worse. Just don't dine at this estab"}
{"text":"Miso Ramen was excellent!!! Was starving and looking for a place to eat, definitely made the right choice..."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, wonderful service. Absolutely delicious. Came in wanting a nice, chill dinner with my girlfriend and got exactly that! Added bonus, two for one saki promotion!"}
{"text":"The rolls here are amazing. The Panko shrimp rolls are one of the best. The service here is also so good, they are always checking up on you if you need refills"}
{"text":"First timer here. Wanted to try this place because it wasn't here he last time I came. My friend and I shared plates. We ordered the bulgogi beef and diced teriyaki chicken. You have the choice of ramen or rice. We ordered one of each. Each plate was $20 and $19. I definitely didn't have an omg I must come back here experience but it was decent. 

The service was ok. They were friendly and the food didn't take long after we placed or orders."}
{"text":"My sushi was delicious :). They also sat us with no reservation. They also gave us free edamame!"}
{"text":"We came by Paris for a show, attracted by the \"???\" then decided to sit down first for a stylish Japanese dinner. Ordering and service were super fast, and an edamame was bonus which did not need to order! Various Japanese food selection with reasonable price and fast services made a definite recommendation. Yelp reviewed must be written for a free cheese cake redemption."}
{"text":"The aria I was all I had. My friends went all out. It was super good. Try the Japanese whiskey, super sweet! Thank you Tien for your service and recommendation!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The udon tastes like alfredo sauce with udon. But service sucks... we were not checked on for 20 mins. I was trying to order more and the servers kept ignoring me. I made I contact with someone of them but the girl with the short hair rather talk to the sushi Chef then check on us. I guess that's what you guys pay your severs for. there is so much staff here but everyone is just conversating with each other."}
{"text":"Quality was worthy of the pricing. I ordered the Yakuza roll and my boyfriend ordered the Sekushi lobster. Both were delicious! Definitely a good sushi restaurant to check out while you're on the strip."}
{"text":"Nice casual Japanese/sushi restaurant inside Paris Hotel, good solid food, great service. It was a good change from all the heavy food the last 2 days. Very convenient location."}
{"text":"I woulda given it a 5 if it wasn't overpriced. The sushi was great! I liked the flavor in the surf and turf especially but it's not really a $26 roll, maybe closer to $20, but then again everything is overpriced in Vegas. I'd recommend coming if you're in the mood for sushi! Oh and the sirloin soft bun appetizer was so so good! So much meat and a great sauce!"}
{"text":"I love sushi!
The sushi here is expensive, but really good. 
Small sushi rolls. 
Check in for a free cheesecake!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was best in Vegas. This is second time here in two day.

Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place, first time here. stopped in to get my usual rainbow roll and salmon skin hand roll.hand roll was ok but the rainbow wasn't as good and as fresh as I'm used too. Portions were also very small.service was good. Was seated reasonably.The check was $90 - left a $10 tip + so $100 for so-so sushi for 2?Will not be coming back.I'm good"}
{"text":"We went today around 3pm for sushi happy hour! They have $5.00 appetizers that were fantastic. We got an assortment of appetizers with the Goyza dumplings. I had the Tiger beer which was very lite,similar to a Sapporo. Great addition in the Paris!"}
{"text":"Very good food and fair pricing. Love that they are skewers, they also have skillets and bibimap"}
{"text":"First time here and I was expecting higher quality per previous reviews. 

Service left quite a bit to be desired - staff didn't check on us, didn't have chopsticks,
Soy sauce, or wasabi ready for is when we sat down   

Food was below average,  but expecting it to be amazing. I would rather go to a fast service sushi place than return here again. 

Save your time and money and go somewhere where the food is fantastic and staff take care of you."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was better than expected. We had the wagyu beef tataki, sashimi salad, Japanese miso ramen, salmon bento and crunchy roll. They were all good and fresh. Will come back again because of the friendly service."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the wknd with my gf. We found this place walking through the casino at the Paris Hotel. Decided to try this place out because the decor caught my gf's eye. Food was delicious. The Aria O sushi roll and green tea shots are a must!"}
{"text":"Good not amazing! Small little place inside the Paris hotel, so it's a little pricy. Was impressed by the size of the salmon sushi! Cut rolls were a little small but most were yummy! Yellowtail and jalapeño cut roll, spicy tuna hand roll and salmon sushi didn't fill me up so I ordered a salmon lover cut roll afterwards."}
{"text":"This place was really unreal
 Best service around and the food was amazing. I can't say enough about Novi, she was great!!!"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to understand how the fish can be so fresh while we're in a desert. Great quality, wagu beef, and fois grois- can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Review #129 - 2017

My aunties decided to dine in at Sekushi since they were staying at Paris Hotel & invited us to join them along with a few other people that I've never met before.

Unfortunately, since it was already late and I didn't want my daughter to ruin everyone's meal, I opted to just stay in my room.  My aunties felt bad because they said that the sashimi was really good and they wanted to get me something so I asked for the sashimi salad.

My auntie brought my order to my room around 10:15 PM & I ate the whole thing in less than 2 minutes.  Maybe it was due to the small portions, but also the fact that the fish was super fresh and their salad dressing was so good made me want to go downstairs for another order.

If I ever decide to stay on The Strip, I'll be sure to stay at Paris since my aunties's room was much nicer than my room at Bally's--just so I can come back here for their sashimi salad."}
{"text":"Staff and service A+. I'm only giving stars solely for how sweet and attentive the servers were and great personalities. Food quality and fish - were completely subpar for cost. Unimpressed and would not return. I guess I'm spoiled in California with our amazing sushi options."}
{"text":"Terrible! They charge $16 for one piece does not worth it . Also their service is terrible."}
{"text":"Sweetest waitress served me. Food is pretty good. I was the last guest here and ordered literally on the last call at 12:45am, but they were so nice and gave me food! There's also a wonderful check in offer in which you can get cheesecake or devil's pie. Since they ran out of cheesecake they offered mochi! So I ended up with a nice refreshing dessert :)"}
{"text":"Amazing upbeat restaurant with many choices available. My colleagues and I were visiting from SoCal for the annual SEMA Show. Novi, our waitress/hostess, provided excellent service and was very welcoming and friendly. I will be sure to return again."}
{"text":"Just keeping it real...this place does not deserve 4 stars.  The sushi is sub par.  We had the kimono roll, the king crab and yellowtail sashimi.  I eat at a chain called Ra sushi in LA and it's at least 3x as good as this."}
{"text":"This is a great place while visiting in Vegas. Reasonably priced and very fresh which is most important."}
{"text":"Incredible meal! My husband and I came with two friends and had an absolutely incredible lunch!
Great service!"}
{"text":"The sushi was oeshi desu! Service great and the sushi chef \"Niko\" was extremely skilled! Wonderful surprise & would certainly return! Novi was very helpful."}
{"text":"Had good sushi after a while.. after LA-LV road trip, good spot to refuel. We ordered creamy seafood udon, Kimono and Aria O sushi. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Their Aria O was delicious! Love the crunchy texture. Would definitely come back to try other sushi."}
{"text":"It was delicious! The miso soup and seaweed salad did not disappoint. My fiancé got a sushi combo with seven different nigiri. His favorite was the pacific snapper. I got a chicken teriyaki bento box. The chicken was very flavorful. We'll definitely be back next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great environment with amazing food. Would definitely come back the staff was nothing short of awesome glad I came across this hidden Gem inside the Paris Hotel"}
{"text":"Ordered the chef's choice sushi and grilled sea bass. Sushi tasted fresh, and the sea bass was super creamy and buttery. We also ordered the chicken teriyaki bento and seafood udon, and both were delicious as well"}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever. 

Rice is cheap. Hard, dry, and lacking flavor. Majority of flavor cones from the rice and this accurately shows ir.

Fish barely edible raw.

Price is way over its worth.

I know sushi, and this is worse than conveyor belt sushi."}
{"text":"Prices were on point for what you get. I ordered the ramen and it was really well balanced. Great pork flavor without being overbearing. The king Cali rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"We ended up at this restaurant by chance, waiting for a Wayne Newton show. We were not expecting to eat Japanese food at the Paris hotel, but we stopped to try it out anyway because the menu looked really good. The wagyu was delicious. In fact, everything that we ordered including the sampler plate was delicious. It was actually the best Japanese food I've had in a long time. Thank you so much Akeeya for the great service as well!"}
{"text":"Poor service has been confirmed. The people are definitely nice but I'm not sure if they are short staffed or disorganized. We sat at the sushi bar after 2 pm and after a wave of conference attendees had left. The bar had five seated at the most including the two of us. Our drink order took over five minutes to be delivered and it didn't come with water. When we asked, the server came with one cup of water. I ordered a bento box, and they ended up bringing it separate from my wife's chirashi bowl, and giving it to the guy seated next to us. (He didn't realize it was not his until they delivered me his five minutes later with Bulgogi (I ordered Salmon). 

Overall, the food was just okay. Quality is just as good as buffet sushi. So with the poor service, it's not worth returning. 

(I don't know how it has 4.5 stars!)"}
{"text":"Love it! Besides the food their servers here are really helpful. I'm not much of a sushi eater but they patiently explained what they had on the menu. The surf n turf was probably my favorite! Their steam bun was a winner too. Can not wait to come back here and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"this place is a little expensive, but the food is delicious. it was also a little difficult to find - you have to go in the main entrance of Paris LV then wind your way to toward the back of the hotel to find the restaurant. but it was well worth it - decor, music, and staff were all awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by the good reviews. The salad dressing is pure soy sauce and leaves an inch or so reservoir at the bottom. The rice tastes as though it was made a few days previously, cooled and microwaved. The seaweed was so rubbery, because it was old, that it was almost impossible to chew. Speaking of impossible to chew, the actual fish was cut very thick and again, was NOT fresh. Do not eat here. I rarely leave reviews for this but I am afraid someone will get ill. This was really, really terrible."}
{"text":"Great quality food.  The uni was so fresh.  Love the service and the wait staff is awesome.  This made staying at the Paris hotel even better than I could imagine."}
{"text":"Great service and great sushi! Lots of choices for appetizers. Fair prices. Definitely worth a try if you're staying at Bally's or Paris."}
{"text":"Me and my cousin ate here for the first time on our trip to Vegas! The fish was very fresh and the bulgogi bento was very good! The set up was nice and modern but still had Japanese culture!"}
{"text":"SEKUSHI is Great the Service was EXCELLENT, I had the Pacific and Blue Oyster combo that was excellent, then had Unagi, Tako, and Uni, and to top it off I had two more Unagi Salmon Skin Hand Roll and a Spicy Tuna Hand Roll with the House Saki and Kirin Beer, Miso Soup."}
{"text":"these guys need to study japanese cuisine, little bit off, A for effort thou, you can tell no ???in the kitchen.

flavors great, sushi on the good side but hamachi kama
not cooked all the way thru, and no daikon oroshi 

wagyu tataki was real wagyu but cut way too thick
they could have at least gotten another order had they sliced it thinner

miso soup salty, too much miso,

service not so great, japanese speaking girl running around but when you asked her for something she would call somebody else with out explaining what we wanted so had to order twice basically, they need to work on that

overall nice try, i would return besides all the little gripes"}
{"text":"Went to eat here and it wasn't really very good. The fish was flavorless, and the staff seemed very confused when I asked for a simple tuna roll. Maybe this is geared towards more experienced sushi fans, but I felt let down. Poor selection of rolls on the menu. There are 1000 other places to have sushi in this town. Maybe try one of them?"}
{"text":"Tuan was outstanding, sit at the bar. The Baja crispy is the best roll I have ever had. Wow. Places rocks the sushi."}
{"text":"Late night limited menu and open till 1pm in Paris Hotel, sure why not.  

Nice small restaurant.  Our server was very nice.  

The bus boy gave us some edamame and unfortunately one of the edamame's looked like it was bitten and eaten.  Our server then got us another batch and she apologized.  Oh my... 

I ordered a glass of wine and shrimp tempura roll.  My friends ordered a few other dishes but I don't know what it was called. 

Being that I do stay at the Paris from time to time, I'll possibly return."}
{"text":"Very good and nice place located inside the Paris Hotel. You have to hug the walls of the casino to get there, and once you do, the food does not disappoint. They greeted us with complementary edamame, which was a first for me. The fish was good and the rice was too. The ginger dressing on the salad was very delicious. If you're in for sushi at the strip and looking for a quick bite, this is a good spot!"}
{"text":"A rare find in Vegas. We had 6 pieces of oysters which is really fresh. I highly recommend the signature sekushi roll with foie gras. I would come back again."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Las Vegas! Novi was an excellent server. Salmon skin hand roll, oyster shooter, negihama were all spectacular. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"The place looks very nice. Table is be very space saving. Service is ok, staff is courteous.   Unfortunately, the rice is too moist and sticky. Definitely not sushi rice, ruins the whole creative sushi roll."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30 for dinner. Food and service are really great! It may seem pricey, but for being in a nicer hotel it is reasonable. Chirashi is a good deal if you're not too picky! Sushi by the piece is a little expensive but rolls are decently priced. The Salmon Avocado roll is great! Overall food and service were excellent. Definitely one of the best restaurants at Paris."}
{"text":"First time I'm eating here ... they have a Very good sushi and absolutely great service ! 
I Didn't need to wait long for the food and the servers were super nice. 
Check in with them on yelp and you'll get a free cheesecake .. 
highly recommended"}
{"text":"lovely restaurant , im in this hotel.( paris) i are here last night and i having lunch today. and the girls are really nice"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good sushi. I came here for a quick bite before my flight and ordered the sushi set with 7 nigiri and a roll. It was expensive but pretty good. They also gave complimentary edamame which was nice. I was a little disappointed that my hot green tea was just a simple tea bag... not the good stuff.  I guess that's what I get for ordering hot tea in Vegas! It was a little hard to find at first... if you're coming in from The Strip walk towards the back and go left and its near the shops and other restaurants."}
{"text":"As a Japanese person, I was skeptical, but this place is so much better than I thought it was going be. Wait stuff very friendly and attentive. The food is almost authentic Japanese, with a bit of twist for foreign customers. Pleasant surprised. I highly recommend this joint. 
????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Small restaurant inside Paris. Convenient location. Sushi was really good and our server Teresa was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I was walking along Paris and decided to grab a quick bite.

I stumbled upon Sekushi, and I'm glad I did!

I asked the server what she would suggest for their signature rolls, and she said the Aria O.

Considering that I just wanted a quick meal, one roll was enough.

The Aria O has salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, jalapeno, micro cilantro and honey truffle aioli. Since I am not a big fan of cilantro, I asked if it would be very pungent in the roll, and she assured me that it would not be overpowering the other elements of the roll. Good!

Out comes the food! Beautiful! Presentation's great!

And this roll had a bold immense flavor. It's a good thing I listened to Sandra's suggestion, she was right, the cilantro was not overpowering.
I loved the honey truffle aioli, it made the roll come together harmoniously! Ingredients were fresh, and the jalapeno was just the right amount to make it spicy but not burn your tongue.

I would definitely come back; food, price and service are great! 

I had a wonderful experience, and I would certainly come back to taste more of their signature rolls, and I would for sure recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"I don't get why the rating is so high. Decent looking place and good customer service are the only reasons for the 2 stars. Other than that the food is overpriced. The portions were too small. I ordered a rainbow roll, steamed rice and beer. My boyfriend had one their rolls with eel, don't recall the name - that's how poor it was, and some poke. Both rolls were small, dry and lacking flavor. I think the sushi buffet on the strip is way better than this and that's where'd you'd actually expect it to be not so great. Yet, somehow we wished we'd gone there. We basically paid $77 for appetizer sized meals."}
{"text":"Great food. I orders hamachi Kama with a side of rice. It take time for grilled fish which I understand. The hamachi came out perfect. Not too rare and not too well done. The hamachi collar is big compare to what I usually get. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"King salmon was mostly crab for $14. Rolls have rice on outside and sashimi doesn't come with rice at all. Overpriced and not authentic."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good service though my kids keep playing and dropping their chopsticks in the floor. My husband ordered some raw oysters: blue point, pacific, jumbo & kumamoto, tastes good. He also had Sekushi Sashimi with assorted raw fish in it. While I ordered a Pork Katsu Bento box, portion of the rice is small not enough for sharing with my son that I have to ask for another cup of rice and the dressing for the salad was ginger flavor not bad though. 

Next time we come back in Vegas, i'll probably try to go some other japanese restaurant instead. But we enjoyed the food they have."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and reasonable prices. Unfortunately I was forced last minute at the restaurant to write this review in order to get my free cheesecake or mousse as a Yelp check in bonus.  Not part of the original deal, and not transparent. Also, despite me telling the server we had this promo she failed to mention they only had cheesecake, not the mousse."}
{"text":"The 3.5 star review is mostly dedicated to the sweet sushi chef we had. He was so nice and patient with us. Different from most Japanese restaurants where the sushi chefs at the bar would be fast paced with none to minimal conversation. The food was just alright, we got the salmon avocado roll and salmon skin roll, with the salmon skin roll tasting very burnt and charred."}
{"text":"Great service!  Melissa was awesome suggesting great options for our large group. Green beans appetizer were a great start along with the dumplings appetizer. Sashimi was tasty and fresh.  Overall very satisfying."}
{"text":"Must say that this  place exceeded, by far, my expectations! Came downstairs thinking I would just grab a sushi roll and take it back up to my room. From the moment I walked in, however, Novi- my sever- greeted me and made me feel so welcomed that I decided to stay and eat. The food most definitely did not disappoint and I will definitely be back! You can find good food anywhere, but good hospitality is rare and therefore priceless."}
{"text":"Seriosly, the food here is just amazing. Looks like it's real Japanese place. Fresh food, open kitchen, descent prices. I got ramen and sushi 7 set - haven't eaten such a tasty sushi in a while. Highly recommend it. Was not easy to find. Go to the reception and turn left when you reach it."}
{"text":"The service was good. The King Crab Cali roll was not so great. Sea bass was mediocre. However, the Salmon was really fresh and good."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient and the food was quickly prepared and delicious. We recommend the Green Mussels if you like a little spice."}
{"text":"Maybe good for people that don't eat Asian/Japanese food frequently or any at all. If you have any palette, the prices don't even come close to the food served. 22 dollars for a basic roll with super small cuts of fish.

Service great, food.. not so much. If I had to compare this place with a chain, I would say Niko Niko is significantly better in terms of food quality and taste."}
{"text":"This was the first place we went to get dinner in Vegas... because I love Japanese food and it was highly rated with just two dollar signs on yelp. Im not sure how they got two dollar signs on yelp because one piece of uni was $8 before taxes... where in most places its usually about $6-$8 for two pieces. I went ahead and ordered it anyway because I love uni but as soon as I tasted it, it wasn't as good as the other places I normally go to.. you'd think for the price it would at least be comparable but it was far from it... and I dont remember seeing on the menu where they source their uni. I also ordered the Aria O - which was recommended by our original server, it's one of their more popular rolls... unfortunately, after almost waiting for two hours, it never came. The manager and our main server were very nice and kept on apologizing about the mishap - where half of our orders never came out even after almost two hours of waiting. 
Me and my friends were hungry, upset and to add insult to injury - one of their male servers that handed us the tuna tartare gave us attitude. Im not sure if he was having a bad day or maybe he thought we were just a bunch of complainers but he should've seen/ known that his manager is already trying to do service recovery and he just made the whole experience from bad to worse after almost slamming that bowl of tuna tartare on our table and giving us so much attitude - we were a group of 6 girls and everyone saw and felt the attitude he gave us. 
The manager ended up not charging us for the food that 3 of my friends got and offered to take care of us if we came back but most of us were traumatized with the experience and just opted out."}
{"text":"King Salmon roll - doesn't have any taste at all, didn't like it - 1/5
Rainbow - feels like all ingredients were frozen. Didn't like it - 1/5
Aria - spicy, but not crazy. Average taste, not good, not bad. Like nothing. - 2/5
Hot Spring-  warm roll. The one I liked. A little bit spicy, but ok - 4/5
Skin Salmon - nice, sweet and a little bit smoked. I liked it - 3/5
Waitress Sandra - awesome, friendly and polite - 5/5

General impression of the place: didn't like, won't return, don't recommend..."}
{"text":"Presentation was good but sauce for dumplings VERY vinegary . Crab leg sushi tasted old. Overpriced. Did not at all leave a wow favtor"}
{"text":"Enjoy our family dinner here the food was great. Enjoy it very much. If you have time come enjoy fresh sushi from Sekushi at Paris Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hit the spot for a sushi craving, get the tuna tartar. Reasonable pricing too considering the location. Nice touch w the complimentary edamame!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a quick drink before heading out for dinner with colleagues. Enjoyed a very unique Oyster Shooter w/quail egg. 

Really wanted to try the food after seeing the fish behind the counter.  

Came back next night and was treated to edamame to accompany my saki bomb and oyster shooter. Followed up with very fresh and filling yellowtail jalapeño and salmon avocado rolls. Ended the night with a a satisfying slice of matcha cheesecake. Thanks corporate card and Sekushi for a great meal 

Hopefully you get Novi as your server. She is awesome. 
Kampai"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Paris Las Vegas and decided to hit up this restaurant before we went to Jay Leno. We are a huge sushi family so we know what to order and what good sushi tastes like.  Our servers were terrific but that is where it all ended.  The edamame they brought us before dinner was very sad looking. I also ordered a glass of Merlot and was brought out a tiny, tiny glass of very mediocre wine.  I figured for the price I paid it should have been much better.  My family ordered sushimi and got one small piece of fish for $12.  I decided to try something different and ordered the wagyu beef and the seared foie gras.  They were absolutely the smallest dishes I have ever been served in my life.  The wagyu was around $15 and only 3 tiny strips of meat.  I had to fold them over just to get a taste of the meat. The foie gras was $36 and 4 tiny slices probably the size of a penny. I was starving and broke by the time I left the restaurant. Would have rather gone to the Dim Sum place next door.  At least I would have been full when I left. With all the great restaurants in Vegas, I will never go back to Sekushi again!!"}
{"text":"Good chirashi! Within the business of Las Vegas it's good to get tucked away and enjoy some sushi here!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Tried the ramen and it came out lukewarm! Staff is very attentive, but unfortunately they are not detailed enough to notice that the extra dishes they handed me were crusted with leftover food."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stopped here during a conference and had a wonderful meal. The food was delicious, especially the sushi, and our server Sandra was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 7PM and the wait for a table was until 9PM so we sat at the bar. We weren't given a drink menu and had no idea about the variety of Japanese beers and sake they had. It was a guessing game. The waitress came to take our food orders and we had to ask about the drinks otherwise we wouldn't have been asked. The food came out before the drinks and I had to remind the waitress about the beer. I ordered the six piece sashimi which came with yellowtail, tuna and salmon, typical but fresh and delicious! I ordered one piece of $15.00 Otoro sushi which was delicious and fatty. I also ordered the Wagyu beef skewers tapas style which was delicious as well. I recommend this place for convenience."}
{"text":"I loved this spot between Paris and Balleys
Fresh food really quick service and extremely nice servers and cooks! Check it out soon"}
{"text":"Aria O and Baja Crunchy rolls are so delicious - a perfect balance of flavors. Prompt and happy customer service."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Customer service was great. They were really quick! :) 

I got the chicken teriyaki bento box (comes with rice, salad, and miso soup) and it's a decent size. It filled me up. I liked it. We also got sashimi salad. That was ok. I think it would be better if they had a different dressing because the one that comes with the salad is really salty in my opinion. But other than that, it was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving for some Japanese cuisine and we found this place. 
This place is truly amazing and delicious! You have to stop by here if you're in Vegas. It's located in Paris hotel. The seafood creamy udon, Aria O, buttered scallop and surf and turf are a must order !! It was so delicious. Our server Sandra was extremely friendly and helpful as well. I definitely recommend anyone to stop by if you're craving some unforgettable Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Great spot. The salmon roll was mouth watering and the soup was delicious. We got the cheesecake as well, perfect for my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Located inside the Paris hotel casino.  Great happy hour see pics.  We had the oyster shooters, and almost every role on the happy hour menu.  We were actually full at the end.  The mackerel sashimi was very good if you like mackerel like I do.  The price outside of happy hour is higher.   However the ladies are prettier here lol.  I say check it out."}
{"text":"Sekushi is by far one of the absolute best Sushi restaurants I have eaten at. I am giving this wonderful place a 5 star rating for the reasons listed as follows. 

1. Ambiance. When you walk into Sekushi, you know immediately that you are in a well managed establishment and will receive only the best treatment. You are welcomed in by all members of the Sekushi team, seated in an area that best suits your personal needs, and the atmosphere around you can only be described as aesthetic. The restaurant is well lit, and far from dull as it is decorated with everything from neon lights to retro Japanese movie posters and kawaii anime eyes. Overall, a very trendy dining experience for people of any age. 

2. Staff. The people are enthusiastic about what they do here. Not only do they greet you, but they say farewell and thank you on your way out. They staff is quick to deliver the food as well as make it, yet the food and service do not seemed rushed in the slightest. Every server seems to be well polished in their profession as they are light on their toes, friendly, bubbly and well mannered. The bussers are quick to clean the place up as well as they are kind to offer cleaning up anything that may be of hindrance on your table. The chefs are skilled in their stations as well, always ensuring that the food is well prepared and that their station is always sanitary. 

3. The food. Everything in this establishment is extremely well prepared, and let me just say that you get what you pay for. My first time ever eating uni I tried here. The color was just as it is supposed to be; a bright light orange. In comparison to the other restaurant I ate it at afterwards, I was astounded to discover that this other place had given me the worst tasting food I had ever eaten in my life. After eating at Sekushi I  have learned what good sushi is supposed to taste like. The fish is fresh and colorful, the food is far from bland, and is a symphony for the taste buds. Everything from the appetizers, to the entrees, rolls, deserts and alcoholic beverages are up to par,  delectable and full of flavor. 

Oh, and one more thing, Nevada locals park for free inside the Paris parking garage, which is a huge added bonus. No worrying about rushing your food down to get that cheaper parking ticket. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happen to stumble upon this sushi restaurant on our way to brunch. 

We came on a busy Saturday night and the waiter, waitress and the hostess were so nice. We said we'd wait for the bar seating and they said they had a table open for us if we wanted to sit right away. So sweet. We waited for about 20 minutes then we were promptly seated but during those 20 minutes the waiter, waitress and the hostess asked if we still wanted the table. Again, so sweet of them for checking in on us and seeing if we changed our minds. 

We ordered the Waygu beef tataki and boy was it flavorful. I liked having the lava salt on it. The Creamy seafood udon was extra creamy. Reminded me of seafood pasta in Alfredo sauce. The Aria O roll was delicious. I love the crunch on the outside of the roll. My boyfriend ordered the chef's choice sushi and the fresh wasabi. It was a generous portion for an extra $3. 

Note: if you check in you'll receive a free desert. We were so full so they kindly packed it to go."}
{"text":"Im not the best in yelping cuz i always forget to take pictures of my food, i devour it lol and then i tell myself \" oh man i should of taken a picture! This was on the way to a night club at Paris casino and we were in for some sushi! So we came here and ordered very quickly and food came out soon after. The miso soup was on point and hot. We ordered the Aria O roll x2 and the baja crisp x 1. They were both good but the Aria O was the best. Definitely try it."}
{"text":"Nice little find on the middle of Paris. The will cater to your sushi roll needs of you don't see what you want. The bent salmon is good. Cheesecake is huge"}
{"text":"Pretty pleased with this spot overall.  The restaurant is small, lots of seats at the sushi bar.

I really enjoyed my Surf and Turf Roll - with two caveats - a couple of my steak pieces has tough fatty spots and it was quite salty (I like salt, so it didn't really bother me but it may be off putting to others)

The Aria O Roll was fun. Cited as one of their popular rolls, I can see why. The crunch makes it distinctive.

Service was attentive.  I actually was in and out of there in about 30-40 minutes."}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant. Just had lunch with the family (2 kids of 10 and 8) and everyone liked it.
Service was good and fast besides being high season.
Also value/price is very good. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Located inside The Paris hotel. Great service, they're open late and the sushi is tasty. Right after the BSB concert we needed some food fuel. We were running behind, which is always the case for me, so we didn't have time to eat before. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Came in with four friends on a whim for lunch. Everyone really enjoyed their lunches! One had sushi, two had the salmon bento boxes, and I had the ebi don.

My lunch was delicious! The only problem I had was that the sauce was a bit too sweet/salty, especially by the time I got to the bottom. The tempura shrimp was light and lovely!

We also had great service! I highly recommend this place if you want some quick, delicious Japanese food.

*This review was written in exchange for a free dessert."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento which comes with rice, ginger salad, miso soup, a slice of orange, chicken teriyaki of course, and chicken roll. The chicken was extremely dry, rice was too small of a portion, salad had a weird taste and there was sesame on everything and wayyy too much of it. Couldn't even scrape it off my meal since I hate sesame seeds. I hate Vegas food lol everything sucks"}
{"text":"The service was great, and the food was even better. This was the freshest sushi I have had in Vegas with my favorite being the snapper and tuna belly.

Will make this a regular stop on my Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"We were wandering through the Paris hotel looking for something to eat. We stumbled upon Sekushi and couldn't get past the menu. They have a special of 5 protein skewers for $25. We wanted a variety so we got the grilled shrimp, garlic scallops, waygu beef, Korean kalbi and teriyaki chicken. The presentation was beautiful. They laid out the skewers with a flower and designed it so nicely. All of them were really good. The scallops were my favorite. The only complaint I have is how small they were. The shrimp were the size of popcorn shrimp. Each portion was super tiny. Otherwise, I would say this is a great deal for the price and location."}
{"text":"Service was not good. We requested for so many things from the busy waiters, including soy sauce, chopsticks, water, and napkins... Waited for a long time for the foods as well. The foods are okay but pricy considering the quality and portion."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The steak was great and good portion. They also have sushi on the other side for you to order as well. The service is great!!! Staff always checking if we are ok. Over all I would recommend this place you should give a shot!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing!! We got a couple of rolls, but the hot springs roll is definitely the best! Everything tasted so fresh. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised to find this gem on the strip!  Food and service was great!  Price matched the value of food we received."}
{"text":"Sushi was very fresh. 
service was great, but the pieces were on the small side. One roll had a lot of rice. The tolls were delicious though"}
{"text":"Loved the service and food, definitely recommend for Japanese restaurant! I've requested to make order modified my way and they made it very nice and with no problem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I must say that Teresa was amazing on making sure my service was was good as the food. Will definitely come in again and recommend others try this place out."}
{"text":"If you actually eat and enjoy sushi in NYC, LA, SF etc do not bother with this place. The service and presentation is good 4 stars but the food needs improvement."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! This restaurant is located inside the Paris hotel and it took us awhile to find. It's located near the back of the casino and where all the restaurants are located at. We were seated at the sushi bar. It's a bit overpriced but what do you expect...it's at the middle of the Las Vegas strip.

I ordered the Japanese miso ramen ($18) and my friend ordered the Chirashi don ($22). We were given edamame to start off. The ramen broth was on the bland side and it didn't have that nice rich miso broth. I eat a lot of ramen in the Bay Area and had the best ramen in Japan, so you can say I'm a ramen snob. There were a few slices of chashu and half an egg, topped with bean sprouts and two pieces of seaweed. It was a decent size bowl size of ramen but the flavor just wasn't there.

The Chirashi don was a piece of art! There was a variety of raw fish on the bed of rice. The rice was a bit dry but the fish was fresh. 

I also checked in on Yelp and I asked for the cheesecake. Unfortunately, they were out of the cheesecake but they had the green tea mochi. The mochi was filled with green tea ice cream and topped with some whipped cream. So remember to check in guys!"}
{"text":"This was a cute sushi place we encountered on our last night in Vegas. Its tucked away in the Paris hotel. We ordered a couple of rolls and the sushi was fresh and tasty. Recommend if you want something casual and craving sushi!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"First sushi restaurant I've been to in Vegas and was left wanting more. Without coming off as too pretentious here, both my fiance and I spent over a decade combined working in restaurants so we understand the workings of the service industry. We get that sometimes servers are overwhelmed or in the weeds with too many tables, etc... I felt that our server had plenty of time to talk with the fellow co-workers but never once checked on our table once the food was dropped off. This means that by the time she finally did come back and dropped the bill off we hadn't received two of the items we ordered. Unfortunately we never had time to communicate this with her prior to the bill arriving because she never stopped back. Of course once this was addressed they were then taken off our bill but no additional service recovery was taken. I'm not asking for hand outs, but if you forget not only 1 but 2 of the menu items a table has ordered you should probably make an effort to do something to prevent a review like this from happening. All of this being said, the fish was fantastic, albeit slightly overpriced but what isn't in Vegas. We were very pleased with our food but the service, or lack thereof, will drive people away from this place. The only thing saving this from being a 1 star review was the Uni sushi. Some of the best I've ever had and I'm a huge sucker for Uni"}
{"text":"Creamy udon seafood bowl was very large and tasty. Fire roll was delicious. Great staff who checked on the table multiple times. My only problem was the music was a little too loud for good conversation."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi 
Very quick and professional shushi guys 
Will come again 
Very recommended A++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"It's a little pricey for the portion but not bad. 

I ordered:
creamy seafood udon - not bad, udon wasn't over cooked and the broth wasn't over seasoned, perfect balance and combination of the creaminess of the soup and seafood.
Nigiri -
  wagyu beef; nothing special, it is sweet, tasty and soft
  foie gras; very tasty and velvety, must try
  saba; love the fishiness, doesn't have a weird after taste, one of my fave
  hamachi; I didn't care for it, just like the wagyu beef, nothing special, it wasn't melt in my mouth but it definitely did not taste fishy. 
  hotate; nothing special about it either, it was sweet and tasty. didn't taste fishy at all.
aria o roll - the rice was waaaaaaaaaay too mushy, maybe it was just that day, not sure. flavor profile was not bad, it was a nice combo of flavors (i love avocado), ordered this roll since it had the least amount of sauce, I don't like rolls in general.

Service wasn't bad, the servers were attentive and friendly. The food was just not mind blowing though but I don't mind coming back for the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese food inside Paris, we especially like the eel. Don't forget to check in to get a free matcha cheesecake."}
{"text":"Couple problems that i experienced.1) miso soup. too salty, maybe don't order it if you could. 2) rice is too hard to chew, under cooked base on my knowledge. 3) Japanese restaurant but all the employees are non Japanese working here and playing korean, so that could explain a little bit of something i guess. good luck to find it, hidden inside the Paris hotel center..over all, not a fan of this place.."}
{"text":"I am so satisfied on the service  I experienced  eating  here .excellent foods !!congratulation !! Thank you. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"It's a small sushi restaurant tucked in Paris. One nice feature is that it's open late. The sushi here is pretty good but doesn't quite compete with some of the other strip superstars. 

This would have been a 4 Star review but I think we caught the Sushi chef on a bad day as he was a bit grumpy and even a little rude. Service matters!!"}
{"text":"The Baja crispy roll was really really good. Will definitely get that again. Great service. Tasty miso soup too."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would!! We spent $120 on 3 small, tasteless rolls (Sekushi Rainbow, had shell pieces from the crab, King Cali, basically a grocery store California roll, and their \"signature\" Lobster Roll, no flavor) and a 3 piece sushimi salad that literally came at least 10 min after everyone else got their rolls. The salad was an appetizer. Service was good, the only good thing I have to say about this place. Needless to say, we're headed for a real dinner now! Don't waste your $$$!!"}
{"text":"Pricy place. Small portions. Food is delicious. It's located in the Paris hotel, it explains pricing policy. I really enjoyed creamy seafood udon soup with extra shiitake."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant either shall be removed from Paris Las Vegas. If not, its executive chef shall be fired or the own shall look for a new chef if he or she is the chef.

You can tell from the traffics of crowds. I sensed it but still gave a try and I was right about it.

Don't give me wrong, the services are great like the most of restaurants in Vegas. If you believe that the taste of food is your ultimately choices by the end day, this place is not what you would like to go. It does Not taste what what it is worthy based on the location as well as the price. I understand the portion may be varied...

Imaging you can taste raw salts in the sushi rolls. The rice is cheap ones, certainly not the authentic Japanese rice. Shrimp tempura is the typical low-end deep fry style. It was not even well done and worse than Safeway sushi!

Overall I would never go again since there's so many other great ones to go."}
{"text":"The good. Sashimi was very good. The quality, flavor and texture were excellent. Very fresh. Everything else was mediocre- average. Roll flavor & quality was similar to what you will get in your average local strip mall sushi joint. Service was ok - I had to track a server down after not being acknowledged for some time (not a huge deal) after that very attentive.  The restaurant decor / ambience was lacking for an in casino restaurant on the Las Vegas strip.  Again, similar to what you will get in your average local strip mall sushi joint (only with Vegas strip price tag).  When I look at the overall meal and what I spent this place gets 2.5 stars and I likely will try other spots vs coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Buttery, sweet fresh sushi, good service and not badly priced.  Great lunch."}
{"text":"Got the Uni Don. First time in my life trying it and it was delicious. Fun environment and great service."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and eat some Japanese food. Had the tempura shrimp bento box and it was amazing! Tempura was crispy, rice wasn't dried and our waitress was so welcoming. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Yul yul she so cute! And good take care of me!! Promise I'll come back. Test so good!! I love cool Sake!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great. Service was good and my dish that I ordered was great. Our waitress Naomi was very friendly and constanly checked on us. I ordered the seafood udon. It was just the right creaminess and filled with lots of seafood. Its a huge portion too, essily shareable! I also tried the salmon avocado roll which was very fresh and tasty. The food is very reasonably price, especially compared  to the expensive food on the strip!"}
{"text":"The sushi was excellent! Very fresh and high quality with wonderful service. The atmosphere was fun, inviting, and casual."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good actually. Be aware this is a 3 star as far as price. Premium rolls are over $20. It's a bright room without a lot of character."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a conference and heard about the delicious sushi at Sekushi. The reviews weren't wrong--we had a great time and everything we ate was delicious. Our waitress, Areeya, made great suggestions and our sushi was fantastic. The prices were really reasonable for Vegas"}
{"text":"Nice food. Very happy to have dinner with family here. The waitress give very good service."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and beautifully presented! Definitely recommend the mussels! They pack so much flavor in every bite. The wait staff & hostess were very sweet and accommodating however, sitting at the sushi bar the chefs didn't make any effort to welcome or communicate with us."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here. It was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. We sat at the sushi bar. The chairs were a bit uncomfortable but the place was decorated nice. The place is a bit small for a sushi restaurant. We ordered several appetizers and tried the lychee sake. It was a big bottle. They give you free edamame to snack on. I enjoyed the wagyu beef skewer a lot. Beef was cooked to perfection. Mussels were good as well but a little spice to it. We also had the oyster shooter shots. My first time trying it and it was good but strong. We ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner and the sushi combo. Sushi was fresh and good. Size of the fish was cut big so it will definitely fill you up. We had so much food we had no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Located in The Paris Hotel Casino on The Las Vegas Strip. OK so it's a bit cramped. The Sushi was very fresh. I thought the prices were reasonable. If you want a table, I recommend making a reservation, unless you want to sit at the bar. There is a Yelp checkin offer. 10% Off for locals. So don't be that guy, and check in on Yelp! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"this is the worst Japanese restaurant I ever been. The worst chicken teriyaki, I can make that with my foot. The octopus taste like wet wood and the water  eel rice is too salty and oily."}
{"text":"My First time here. Everything was so good fresh fish and crab. We ordered bento set and Rainbow roll was so delicious. Our server is super nice and friendly very attentive. I will come back again."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Sushi resturant ever.  Novi perfect server"}
{"text":"Great decor with my sushi. Ordered dumplings, hot springs, bulgogi Bento box and scallops! Will definitely come here again tonight for a midnight snack attack with my beer (805)! Loving the cheese cake."}
{"text":"Very good, i like salmon lover roll! i ordered pork katsu box as well. and the cake is very good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Bomb!! Great location and a awesome spot for a quick bite. Nikko is the sushi messiah. Just stop drop n roll!"}
{"text":"Popped by here on a whim since we were staying in the hotel, and it was pretty good! I was in Italy for 2 weeks and had been really craving some good sushi and this place didn't disappoint. The real highlight of the meal was the uni scallop nigiri - literally 2 of my favorite things combined into 1 single heavenly bite. The prices were quite reasonable, overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"The salmon sushi and tuna sushi were yummy and fresh! And the gyoza were delish!
Service was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We are so happy we came here for dinner! We ordered the Uni Shooters, Kumamoto Oysters and Bluefin Sashimi! OH MY GAWD!!!! Everything was so fresh and so flavorful. 

Aside from the amazing food, the service was also superb. Everyone was so nice and attentive. 

Must try for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, Jane was so friendly and gave excellant recommendations on her favorites. Enjoyed the evening. Good atmosphere, great food."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and friendly staff! Got free edamame as an app. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I'm baffled at how this place got anything over 2 stars.  Worst sushi ever. The rice was hard, dry and beyond edible. Waitress was only concerned about getting my order so she can eventually get the bill and check the tip. The price is extremely high and the disappointment matches the price. I suggest anyone considering this place to just save your time and money and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is good but a fair warning pricy if you order sushi. The sushi is very delicious and fresh, the chefs put there own twist on things with the special sauces they add. For appetizers we ordered the wagu beef skewer a long with scallop skewer and the panko mixed appetizer (I forgot the real name). For the main event we ordered the surf and turf roll which is panko shrimp topped with seared wagu beef (I added mango), the lobster roll, spicy scallop roll and a spicy tuna roll. Nice place and really delicious."}
{"text":"The miso soup was Amazing, and the bento is great if you want a safe pick for dinner.
They are very attentive to your refills and are rather quick with getting something if you need it.
Very friendly and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The bento boxes are tasty and a good value for the price! The service was very attentive and treated us well. Would highly recommend if you're searching the strip for an Asian fusion spot!"}
{"text":"Omg! Best Sushi chef ever!! Chef Nikko absolutely outstanding and made a couple of things that I have never had before. Out of this world service! Thanks so much Chef Nikko, we will be back to see you soon! Live in LA, here every 6 weeks, so save me a seat at the Sekushi Bar!! love it!!!! --"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin while my husband was away at a conference. We each got the salmon bento box. The service was just ok, as well as the food just being ok. Price wise, this was reasonable for what you received. 

Note: if you do the Yelp check in for dessert, you must show them on your phone that you are giving them five stars before you can receive this..."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant inside Paris Casino.  It's a great place to drop in for a light fresh healthy and tasty bite.  The staff was very courteous.  Our server kept the drinks topped off without prompting.  The music and ambiance was awesome!"}
{"text":"The hangover cure was awesome! The music was so great! The service was outstanding! My friends and I are in town for a Bachelorette party and this was a great spot for us to come in and enjoy dinner before we went out!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we've ever had!  Everything was fresh and delicious. My husband and I were in Vegas for our anniversary for the first time ever!  We chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews and were not disappointed!

We ordered a sashimi sampler and 4 rolls in total. When you first sit down they bring you steamed and lightly salted edamame. Once my husband showed me how to eat it, I fell in love! We got the combo first. Each piece of fish was better than the next and all melts in your mouth!  When our rolls came we realized that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!  But, it was so amazing we ate it all!  Everything was very fresh!  

The coup de Gras was the cheesecake. We told them we were posting a review on Yelp and they brought us the best tasting cheesecake I've ever had. It was creamy and not overly sweet and absolutely perfect. 

Overall, the food is amazing, the prices are competitive and the decor is fun and lively. 

If you are looking for amazing sushi in a really cool little Japanese pop culture inspired atmosphere, this is the place for you. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very yummy sushi and sake. A bit overpriced and service could have been quicker. Overall, very good lunch! I enjoyed the edamame appetizer as well."}
{"text":"It is a four star for the food but definitely minus one star for the service.  They were unable to honor reservations that were made delaying us almost 45 minutes because they increased somebody else's reservations for a bigger table.  They had to give us 20% off... Which was nice but they need hosts to better manage the tables.

We tried many things...
Creamy udon-it's like various seafood with an Alfredo miso soup base.  It was decent and good to share.
Sekushi roll- skip it.. It comes in three pieces and really not worth the price 
Yellowtail taco-it's ok.  Just as it sounds like.
Aria-o roll - great... Get this one
Buttered scallops- it was good.. Comes with five pieces.
Tuna tartare-really fresh and delicious
Fried shrimp- I don't believe it was really a tempura batter and it was just ok

Only had one cloudy sake on the menu... But a reasonably priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service! I had the ramen noodles and really enjoyed them. The servers were really nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Very solid sushi spot in Paris Las Vegas. Nothing fancy, but perfect for a quick bite. Service is quick and expedient, the fish is fresh, and the rolls are well-crafted. The restaurant is conveniently located right across from the hotel elevators, so it's easy to hop in and out at any time of day."}
{"text":"Desperate for a healthy meal, we stumbled upon the great Yelp reviews of this place. Our server was great, food came out quickly, and everything was delicious. There's not a lot of great food in this area, but you can count on this spot."}
{"text":"Great food, loved the sushi! Very fresh and delicious. Service was excellent, Melissa took great care of us! Highly recommend Sekushi, we will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Seafood is fresh; we had mackerel and otoro sashimi.

Yellowtail Tiradito, the ponzu and jalapeño went really well with the hamachi.

Yellowtail Ceviche Taco is good too.

The honey truffle in the Aria O roll was delicious! 

Service is great, we'd like to thank Sandra for suggesting the Devil's Pie for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Order aria o rolls! 
Located in the Paris hotel, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Such yummy sushi! The portions are pretty small but it's worth it cuz it's so good! Have Chika take care of you!"}
{"text":"The service was so welcoming, friendly, and sweet. I loved my tempura green beans and vegetable fried rice. All of my friends love their food we had such a good time. Love this place."}
{"text":"Lithe sushi was amazing and not too expensive especially for being inside Paris. It was completely fresh and was prepared fast. They hostess said it would take 30-45 minutes to be seated but was seated in 10. That made us very happy."}
{"text":"Novi is very kind and dinner also super great!! Here is very clean and food is soooo fresh!!"}
{"text":"The kimono roll was my favorite and their bento  box was pretty big! Everyone was super friendly and I came just when they were switching to the late night menu but let me be the last dinner person since I came alone to vegas, dining solo was so good! They took pity on me! Coming back for sure I fell in love with that roll and they played jams from the 90's old school! Yay!"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot for a nice quick meal in Paris. Try the aria O for a unique and tasty roll."}
{"text":"I was on a weekend trip with my girlfriends and we stayed at the Paris Hotel. We were so excited to come to this restaurant inside the hotel once we seen their menu outside. They had many unique menu options and hard to find items such as blue fin tuna. We tried the uni shooters, oysters, blue fin tuna sashimi, tuna belly roll, and sea bass. Every single item was amazing. We even had their chocolate cake for dessert which was given to us complimentary by the most gracious host. The staff was so attentive. The host was receptive and personable and didn't mind the questions we asked about the locations the food came from. We would definitely come back when we return!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to get our sushi fix for our Vegas trip and we were unfortunately extremely disappointed. We ourselves work at a pretty well known sushi place in LA and for a sushi restaurant in Vegas with such high pricing and mediocre sushi, we had high hopes. 

To be honest, the good probably outweighs the bad, but for a place that sells sushi, it leaned more toward bad for me. I'll start with the bad and end with the good.

CONS:
If you want SUSHI, and I mean NIGIRI, do NOT come here. It would be a waste of a penny. It costs $5+ for just ONE piece where at most other sushi places, they charge you that much for 2 pieces.

Sushi had no presentation what-so-ever. No toppings. No options for toppings. Halibut was extremely plain without lemon and salt or ponzu or something. I received a scallop that was falling apart halfway.

Half the waiters looked like they were just there without really knowing the menu or really offering service. They took your order once and bye. They won't even pick up your plates without you asking them too. Really poor at sushi bar. Out of 4 waiters, 1 was attentive enough. Sorry I don't remember the name.

PROS:
If you want satisfying ROLLS, give this place a shot. Their signature rolls were up to par and decently priced for being based in Vegas. I tried the Sakura roll and it was saucy and tasty all over. 
(We also tried to Negitoro Cut Roll and it was average.)

Come here for the small plates and the cooked food. Judging from the menu, this place really likes its Wagyu, so plenty of Wagyu items here. Not easy on the wallet though.
- Gyoza - was tasty and tasted how gyoza should taste. You can probably skip it though.
- Sirloin Steak Steamed Bun - DELICIOUS. No more words for this but that.
- Wagyu Sliders - Good but not all that.

Complimentary edamame when you start. Not bad.

Overall, this place is worth a shot but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. I'd rather go to Katsuya or try another sushi place out. But if you're looking for some rolls or tapas, make your way here. Sushi? Nah."}
{"text":"Eh.   Runners(food) w attitudes(the asian guy behind the sushi counter(not sushi chefs).  Although separately the Server was very pleasant.   They don't carry vinegar-of any kind fresh wasabi is actually powdered.  Ramen is basic."}
{"text":"We wanted something that would be light before going out. Stopped in for some sushi, plus appetizer. Had grilled butter scallops, tried eel and avocado roll, the yellowtail with jalapeno. Also tried Krispy Baja. All were great. Service was great. Must stop if your a sushi lover."}
{"text":"Top 5 bento box I've ever had, and the Aria O roll was pretty tasty. The sushi chefs were lively and the overall vibe was great."}
{"text":"Great place! Got the chirashi and a shot! It's a little tough to find but it is in the Paris hotel! Good food at reasonable prices and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, after 3 full nights in Vegas, the hubs and I were in need of some take out and a movie. Because I had been eyeing this spot in our hotel since we checked in, we decided to check it out!

S = Superior sushi rolls! I opted for the traditional eel roll, which was absolute perfection! The extensive menu offers a wide variety of fancy and simple rolls, perfect for any sushi lover!
E = Excellent Korean dishes! my husband chose to nosh on a few different kabob's to introduce me to the flavors of Korea!
K = Killer staff. We had a tough time navigating the menu, but the hostess was so sweet, friendly and gave us great suggestions to accompany our meal. 
U = Unbelievable vibes/atmosphere! Although we got our food to go, the space exudes a cool/trendy/environment that feels as though you've stepped into a little shop in Korea or Japan!
S = Seaweed salad! OM NOM NOM! Literally full of flavor and so delicious! The hostess talked me into adding this menu item to my cart, and so glad she did! SO GOOD!
H = Hidden in a corner of the Paris hotel, it's quaint and small, and yet, you can't miss it! 
I - Incredible prices! After ordering sushi, seaweed salad, 4 different kinds of kabob's, sushitio peppers, eggrolls and more - our total was a mere $50! 

I find myself craving this place since leaving Vegas and will make a point to stop back in! MMMM!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant located in Paris! I got the 7 piece sushi and roll entree. Very good! The panko shrimp was good too. Our server Theresa was great! Good place to get a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I wasn't able to review the food because we didn't get all of it.
Don't get the green salad with ginger dressing because it is literally just greens and soy sauce. 
We got seated at 630 pm and we didn't get all of our order till we left at 745 pm
They kept apologizing and three people including the manager was already in crisis mode trying to woo us back
But what struck a chord was the server-- who loudly placed the bowl of tuna tartare on our table and didn't even tell us what it was and clearly wasn't thrilled that he was there. 
Never coming back. Boy bye."}
{"text":"I wouldn't expect fantastic sushi in the middle of the Nevada desert, but here it is! All four of us were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, and the service was excellent! I'd come back for sure next time!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot! I was really hungry and was craving for sushi and I must say my cravings was satisfied.  I love how cute the decoration are and the waitress are very nice and helpful too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the aria roll and it was so tasty. It is a little bit spicy but for me it is a bonus for this sushi roll."}
{"text":"Lovely little sushi place right in the Paris Hotel. The waitress, Yui, was great about keeping our water filled and checking on us to see if we wanted to order more rolls. 
We started with  the spicy tuna rolls, AriaO rolls, and rainbow rolls to start. We also had a nice cold Sake and there was a nice selection of Sake to choose from.  The rolls were fresh tasting with none of that nasty amonina odor or taste. We finished with the King Salmon rolls."}
{"text":"What a great place to have fresh sushi. Our waitress Jane was awesome, so was Matt. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great service. I enjoyed the rainbow roll and uni shooter

Yui is great :)"}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing. I loved the kimono roll and the scallops. The only bad thing is that the rolls are so small for the price. I was kinda disappointed with that but overall flavor of sushi was good. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"We were kinda hungry. Wanted to grab a bite before show. This okace was awesome. Great sushi,rolls, beer, and sake. Staff was extremely friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"We did not enjoy the restaurant. King salmon roll had no flavor and was mostly rice. The sashimi was not from the best fish cut. Scallops tapas was ok but not that great. The waitress was crabby."}
{"text":"Yummy! Healthiness! Fresh!

Had dinner & lunch here during our stay. 

The Specialty Sushi is awesome & the regular rolls are good but small. 

We had the Bento Meal for lunch & it was filling. I got the Teriyaki Salmon with the sauce on the side. I was afraid that they'd over marinate it but they didn't... Actually next time I'll order it with the sauce on it to save me a step :-) Hubby had the Bulgogi Beef Bento... it was good but if you're used to the Korean BBQ Bulgogi Taste, this is different. Not bad, just not expected. 

Green tea Ice tea is refreshingly unsweet & made with Matcha. YUM! I asked for some to go & I never ask for To Go drinks.

We will definitely be back! Yum! Oh & did I say that the service was awesome! Very thorough & helpful!"}
{"text":"Food was not as I expected. Prices was a little high for the quality. Liquor over priced, the service is excellent. Will not return but will try a place once. Place was to hot maybe the lights but it was not comfortable to eat with the blazing lights."}

{"text":"Rip off. They have happy hour until 5pm, showed up at 4:45 and they said it was last call and we could not get it. Talk about taking advantage."}
{"text":"It was delicious Wheelara was a good server very gently the surf and turf roll was amazing to die for food came out fast  cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is awesome! Super friendly and attentive! I sat at the bar and got a round of shots for the wonderful sushi chefs. A great experience and seriously excellent fish! Highly recommended for both solo and group experiences."}
{"text":"Jane was a lovely server!  She gave a great recommendation if the asai O roll.  AMAZING!  
Meal was spectacular And speedy.  Will definitely come back.  Best sushi I've had."}
{"text":"Good food, beautiful food presentations. Portions are small that's why 3 stars and over priced"}
{"text":"As a picky eater I can say this about Sekushi Japanese Restaurant:

Great food. Great service. Very clean and fresh. 

I recommend the chicken teriyaki Shishito peppers."}
{"text":"Fourth day on our Vegas trip and everything was great. Never had a disappointing meal yet from In and Out to pho and Italian. The cuisine quality is at a high bar and definitely at par or even better than New York City. That all changed once we ate at Sekushi in Paris hotel and casino. Started off with the hot sake which was pretty good sake for the price. Nice and smooth. Got the complimentary edamame and went with the safe gyoza appetizer and satisfying till that point. The uni scallop nigi was ok but not as great as i hoped. Ceviche taco again nothing mind blowing. Then our entrees came and went all down hill. My girlfriends chirashi don is cover with thinly sliced sashimi that looks nothing like their pictures i saw on yelp. The yellowtail is all mushy and has a weird stanch while the mackerel definitely got too warm and spoiled a bit. My unagi don was un editable. The whole eel has exceptionally sharp and hard bones in it, all over. I ve never had unagi where it was prep beforehand and deboned. The rice from both our entree is off too. I am puzzles how this place got a 4 star. Definitely one of the most over priced fake japanese food joint i ve ever had. So bad that i had to write my comments on the merchant copy of the receipt i left then and create my first Yelp review to warn others. Will be posting on other food review sites to steer people from wasting money and time  at the place."}
{"text":"This sushi bar was located inside Paris kind of tucked away in the back. The waitstaff were very attentive and nice. I have a shellfish allergy and sometimes struggle to find items on sushi menus that don't include shrimp but this place had lots of options. My husband and I were eating a very late dinner and wanted something light so we got miso soups, a spicy tuna roll, and a yellowtail roll. All were delicious. I would come here again."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay, but they didn't offer low salt soy sauce so the saltiness was over the top.  The rolls were \"meh.\" Not even a little sea weed salad or anything to start, which is a little stingy.   It's okay - the bento lunches looked better than the sushi."}
{"text":"I decided that I wanted to eat sashimi and despite the bad reviews I jumped in! Glad I did. The servers were on point and checked on me. The sashimi cuts were very big and worth the price! If you're looking for an inexpensive sushi/sashimi place come here. The guys making the sushi/sashimi plates were very nice as well. Guess the bad reviews could have been bad days. Either way I enjoyed my meal and was pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Very very quick service! Try the surf and turf and the Aria-o! Loved that they had red bean mocchi as not many places do. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by this restaurant. The fish in the rolls is sashimi quality and they have a bunch of really creative dishes as well. The decor is also fantastic. I strongly recommend coming here whenever you're in Las Vegas and looking for sushi."}
{"text":"Solid experience here and the fish is very fresh! Had omakase and everything was spot on. Wished the portions would be bigger but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Incredible sushi!!! Great service and really awesome selection of sushi. Everyone was so friendly and Melissa was a fantastic waitress! Made our trip worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a great Japanese place in Las Vegas, located inside Paris. We ordered the seafood udon, and there were lots of seafood in it and it tasted good!"}
{"text":"Kimchi pork belly was really good. Highly recommend. Also they matcha cheesecake. I'd been driving all day and this was a great place to stop in and get dinner at."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food.  Reasonable for Vegas as well.  The fish was fresh and my party of six all enjoyed their various meals.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Perfect timing to grab dinner since there is no line! We ordered the bento boxes Teriyaki Salmon and the Bulgogi. Serving is just right. Bulgogi was tender and flavorful. The teriyaki is just right kinda crispy in the outside and tender in the inside. Staff is really nice and attentive. Shoutout to Nikki for making sure our drinks dont go empty. Great place in the area of Bally's and Paris!"}
{"text":"The staff was really friendly and accommodating. Food was good, great atmosphere and aesthetic, & the music was amazing!"}
{"text":"Do NOT trust the yelp page and the price rating! This restaurant is definitely over priced and tastes no better than any of the sushi from the supermarket. I spent more than twenty dollars for beef tataki but not expecting only seeing three tiny pieces. I have been to many good sushi restaurants and willing to pay expensive bill if the food worths it, but definitely NOT this one. Worst resultant ever and my first yelp review."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere.  Very fair prices and food was excellent. Sushi was fresh, bento box was very filling."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi place I've had....

Located at Paris Hotel, Sekushi is an adorable Japanese sushi bar. Too bad the food wasn't good.

Chirashi don ($22.00): my sashimi had 3 little bones. Not one. Not two. Three tiny bones! I found the first bone inside my sashimi and showed it to my waitress. One minute later I found another one. The slices were very stringy too. 
Salmon bento ($19.00): better than my chirashi don. It's sad when you get better cooked food than raw fish at a sushi bar. 

FREE CHEESECAKE OR DEVILS PIE WITH YELP CHECK-IN. 

Our waitress was very nice, apologetic and comped our meal. That was the first time I was speechless when someone apologized to me. I couldn't even say it's ok. I felt bad for her, but I was very upset. 

2 stars!!

Sekushi Japanese Restaurant is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with amazing service. The waitress was extremely nice and attentive. We had the eel avocado roll.  They were both very tasty.  However, the highlight of our meal was the creamy udon soup.  They call it the \"hangover cure.\"  But, you don't need to have a hangover to try it.  I totally recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Robata skewers were pretty bland. We tried sea bass, scallop, shrimp, pork belly, and wagyu steak. All kind of blah. Veggies were the same. Not much taste, no smokey flavor."}
{"text":"Sushi bar was delicious Inkko was an amazing sushi chef!  Inkko let me sample different sushi options and was on top of his game.  Every time I come to Vegas he is the only sushi chef I will come to see.

I was greeted by a super sweet hostess and taken directly to the sushi bar.  She was very attentive and brought me edamame to eat while I decided on my sushi options.  I decided to venture from my  normal routine and try some hand rolls. They were all delicious and tasted very fresh. 

I come here every year and I will always come back.  The sushi is consistent and delicious always with good service.

The sushi chefs will try and make anything for you.  They ask you what you like and they make it to suit"}
{"text":"$6 for a piece of a tuna sashimi? Really?
I know this is LV, but c'mon.
I'm seriously shocked.
This is the first time I've experienced this.
All other restaurants will offer you a plate of say, 3 or 6 or even 7 pieces.
Just Terrible.  The menu needs to change.

Now for the cut rolls.
Oh the rolls are just super dinky.  
They look like shrunken rolls. What the heck..
They really need to beef their rolls up.

I'd say the only good thing about this place that's good is the service, that's it!"}
{"text":"Must stop when walking through Paris! Do not miss out! The staff is great and the food is amazing!)?)"}
{"text":"Great spot, amazing rolls. They also have gluten-free soy sauce; awesome option for a lot of people out there I'd imagine. Best sushi I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving some sushi in Vegas so after a bit of research and determining what was close to us we decided on Sekushi in Paris. Very glad that we made this choice because it was delicious. We ordered Spicy Garlic Edamame, Yellowtail Ceviche Taco, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sekushi Roll, and Aria O Roll. The best dish by far was the Sekushi Roll which melted in your mouth. Everything else was well above average and made for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi on my last stay and decided to eat at Sekushi in the Paris hotel. Edamame is complimentary and I received free this of my iced green tea. The sushi rolls I ordered were fabulous, fish was fresh. I ordered just before 3pm and discovered later that starting at 3pm there's a happy hour menu. Wish I had known sooner!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Vegas trip to Bally's. Everything was delicious:

1) aria o roll - wonderful use of spicy mayo mixed with salmon. Loved the crunch on the outside of the rice

2) surf and turf roll - nice mix of seafood with wagyu beef pieces
 
Even on a Friday night we were able to get seats immediatly and all the food came out quickly and was fresh. 

Service was quick and everything we needed was provided. 

Will come back!"}
{"text":"This was my least favorite Japanese restaurant ever. My husband is half Japanese and we live in Orange County and visit Diamond Bar often so we have a very good selection of Asian restaurants nearby.

We were seated quickly, the restaurant was not busy, but once we were seated a few groups walked in after us, and the server went to these groups first before checking with us. They don't seem to be assigned to tables so we were forgotten for several minutes, and about a minute away from walking out before the server came by.

We ordered a bento each and the tempura green beans. She brought us our waters and some Edamame a few minutes later, then the fun started.

I watched the tables adjacent to where we were sitting be brought dishes and the runner ask both tables if they ordered the thing he was holding. This didn't just happen once, it happened 4 times. 

My bento was brought out before the starter, then after several minutes where we were sure they had forgotten we'd order it the starter showed up, and then a few more minutes for my husband's bento to be delivered to the wrong table before finding its way to him. By this point, my salmon was cold. The Miso soup that comes with the bento was served when my husband's bento arrived because they had to make it, and that was probably the best thing we were served. He also didn't receive his roll when the bento was delivered, that came another several minutes later.

The rolls included were very small, I'd assumed they were half but these were tiny compared to a normal piece from a roll, and the entire place is over priced. Don't order the green beans, they were very soft and needed at least a little salt. At $19 per bento, and considering they charge $20 and up per roll, this place could not be more overpriced for mediocre food and service. 

Some of these issues I could understand if the restaurant has been busy when we came in, but it was not. To the point where several of the workers were standing by the bar while we were waiting for any one of them to just bring us water.

I don't think I've ever been to a place that was this bad at just getting the food to the right table. Don't come here, there are better places eat inside Paris."}
{"text":"This is solid sushi at non-Las Vegas prices in the heart of the strip inside Paris. Rolls are not huge but reasonable portions at those prices. Good apps/small plates as well."}
{"text":"Had been craving sushi for two days so I jumped on Yelp and tracked down Sekushi inside the Paris Hotel and Casino. I was dining alone so had a seat at the sushi bar without any problems and was immediately served some warm edamame to get me started and some green iced tea. By the time I was finished I think the staff were a little concerned about how much sushi I managed to shove down my throat- I spent $83 at this place BY MYSELF!

If you're a sake fan I suggest you try a bottle of the Lychee Sake. For $23 it is worth the price and goes down a little too well! For food I ordered the Pork Gyoza, the Wagyu Beef Bun (so tasty and tender), the Yellowtail Ceviche Wonton Taco (super fresh!) plus the Spicy Tuna Hand cut rolls and the Salmon and Avocado Rolls. I definitely could not pick a favourite out of all these dishes as they were all so fresh and so tasty!
Highly recommend for some fresh food on the strip. Hopefully will come back before I leave."}
{"text":"Great little sushi restaurant in the Paris hotel! Food was outstanding and the sushi tasted fresh. Our waitress, Melissa, was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"What can I say???? This is one of the best Japanese Sushi spot I've tasted in a while! Everything tasted so fresh and the unique menu that they offer!  We ate here twice the same day and the manager gave us a couple rounds of saki the second time around! Great customer service as well! The foie gras sushi is to die for!!! I'd come back to this place in a heart beat!!!"}
{"text":"Ok- so we've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did!  We ordered a couple of sushi rolls, the bass, and scallops... the fish was so good and tasty... as was the sushi and scallops. Absolutely delicious!  Service was good... quick... efficient... will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Yui did a phenomenal job at serving us. Food tasted delicious, and it was a time well spent! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If you are going splurge on japanese food this is the place to do it! Service was awesome and fast. They are really nice here. Tina was our waitress and she was really nice and helped my sister by bringing hot water and a white napkin to get her stains off her white t-shirt. Not many waitress do that and it was very appreciated. Not a big fan of sushi but I would come back here next time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite. I ordered the salmon avocado roll and the salmon portions were really generous. We got edamame on the house which was a nice touch. It's a really great value, especially compared to other restaurants in Paris, and the service was quick and friendly. Yui was our waitress and she was great!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Paris, wanted Japanese food, and discovered this downstairs. There aren't very many tables, so we had to reserve for 8:45pm. My family and I were pretty starving by then.

Aria O Roll ($19) - Mango inside was an interesting choice. I rarely eat sushi with sweet/fruity ingredients. The crunchy outer layer is definitely unique!

Chirashi Don ($22) - Yummy assortment of fish and fish eggs over rice. Too much rice, not enough fish!

(not creamy) Seafood Udon ($19) - My mom initially ordered the creamy seafood udon, but it turns out that the soup was super dense and cheesy. We sent it back asking for a seafood udon in a normal soup base (not on the menu), and they were super nice about.

Food is good but not amazing. And the price tag--yikes."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Really enjoyed their miso ramen and my husband really loved their assorted sushi plate. Theambiance is great and they have excellent customer service :) We definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a variety of sushi and are craving ramen!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Presentation for the sashimi was awesome (sorry) we devoured it before we thought of a photo. The bento box was filling- it couldn't finish it!"}
{"text":"For someone that doesn't eat sushi, I really liked this place.  I'm always looking for sushi places with good non-sushi items so that I look forward to going and my wife can enjoy sushi.  Sekushi's Chicken Teriyaki Bento was great and filling.  It came with steamed rice, ginger dressing salad, miso soup and spicy tuna roll (or panko shrimp roll) and chicken teriyaki (of course).  Portions were surprisingly large and was a filling meal (something I'm not used to at Japanese restaurants).

Ordered:
Edamame (complementary)
Chicken Teriyaki Bento (miso soup, steamed white rice, ginger dressing salad, spicy tuna roll and chicken teriyaki)
Aria O Roll (salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, masago arare jalapeno, micro cilantro, honey truffle aioli)

Summary: I would recommend this place.  Just keep in mind that I'm not a sushi expert :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, it's on the restaurant pathway in the Paris Casino. My favorites, the Wagyu Beef Tartar & Fois Gras hand roll.  The Hamachi is very good too.

Great happy hour, but can get packed. 

Prices are a bit high, but hey, quality ingredients and your in Vegas.

Nice size sushi bar, but not a lot of seating.

We frequent this place for a sake or sushi snack."}
{"text":"For the past 2 times we visited Vegas, I've wanted to try Sekushi at Paris because the reviews were always pretty stellar. We arrived to Vegas a little earlier than check in, so we decided to finally try this place out.

We were planning on buffet for dinner, so we ordered 2 rolls here to try: Spicy Tuna cut roll ($9) and Sakura Roll ($24). First impressions, rolls were very small, more like 1/2 size bites or maki rolls. The Spicy Tuna cut roll was not what I expected: chopped up tuna with spicy mayo ON TOP of each piece. The Sakura Roll was very salty, without any soy sauce, which masked the flavors of tuna and whatever else was inside.

The table seating is very underwhelming, doesn't feel like you're in Vegas at all. Try sitting at the sushi bar instead for hopefully better ambiance.

Unfortunately, we will not be coming back for the sushi. I can imagine the bill to grow quite fast if you want to leave feeling full. Almost $50 for a snack and drink before dinner is quite scary even by Vegas standards

I would love to see more noodle options as it's hard to find on the strip, particularly other udon or soba dishes. Hopefully we can give this restaurant another chance somewhere down the road."}
{"text":"I have made it a task to always try a new sushi restaurant every city I go! I believe I have found my 'must go to' sushi restaurant in las vegas. This place is not too big, not too crowded and easy to miss, seemingly unimportant but lord does it pack a HUGE punch!

I'm talking about Sekushi at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. Their staff is extremely friendly and sushi knowledgeable, the service is dead on, the sushi is as fresh as it comes, the presentation is to die for and the flavors will blow your mind!!!

Also, reasonably priced for it's remarkable quality. I've been to many \"fine\" sushi restaurants in Las Vegas that tripled the cost and didn't come anywhere close to this! So if you, like me, are a sushi fanatic and you find yourself in Vegas. Take a trip to Paris! LOL."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was poor, there were ample servers but service was poor. Do try the beef wagyu sliders and try the sashimi sampler."}
{"text":"The food was great. One person I would like to point out is Jessica at the front counter. She was very helpful and assisted us with placing our take out order. She had a great attitude and explained everything on the menu in detail. We will return"}
{"text":"I liked Sekushi because it is a very authentic sushi restaurant right in the middle of Paris.  The prices were fair, the fish was fresh.  You can go on the cheap with a 7 pc plus roll dinner and buy one get one house sake, or you can go all out with Omakasa, fancy rolls, expensive sake.

The booths are comfortable for a small group.  The sushi bar is good for singles but beware of the somewhat uncomfortable bar seats.

There were a number of sushi restaurants that I considered, and based on price, decor, and authenticity, this was the right pick for me."}
{"text":"We returned to Sekushi for lunch several times during our stay. It is a nice atmosphere, the service is efficient and friendly. Sushi quality was great, I don't understand some of the negative reviews here. Sushi is not a cheap meal, and prices were about what I would expect. I took a photo of our lunch including a very beautiful quail egg."}
{"text":"When I tried to make up my mind about which restaurant to go to the hostess welcomed my husband and I with her sweet smile and kind words. The waitress was really nice too. The green mussels were a little spicy but delicious. I would also recommend the steak steamed bun that was delicious!! We had the Bento box because it was more for our buck. The cheesecake had a hint of matcha which is my favorite. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Really, really good. I had the Sekushi Sushi which was chef's choice for seven pieces of nigiri and a special roll. The roll was okay, but the nigiri were some of the best cuts of fish I have had in Vegas. My wife got the creamy udon soup which was very well balanced and had several interesting ingredients. Service was prompt and fast and the decor was well done, if a little cheesy with the sample food displayed. Edamame at the table was a nice touch. 

During our visit, it was very warm inside the restaurant to the point of almost being uncomfortable but I am not sure if that is a common feature. 

Overall we had a great time and will visit again on future trips."}
{"text":"Ambience is good. Sushi is good. Service is good. It's all just... good. Ok. Not great. Not the best sushi meal I've had in Vegas. And I've certainly had better at hole-in-the-wall spots in the Bay Area. If it's all going to be this mediocre, I would expect it to be MUCH less expensive. $8 for ONE piece of sake nigiri?? $15 for a small house sake? This place was a whole lot of MEH."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so well. I ordered the rainbow roll, miso soup, and steamed rice. Miso soup was super good but the rainbow roll was alright. The fish did not melt in my mouth, seemed kind of tough, and didn't seem too fresh. Prices weren't that great either. Sucks that this was our last dinner in Las Vegas. Regrets."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! Fast and friendly. Gorgeous atmosphere(in Paris). We will DEFINITELY be back!! :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi. Perfect selection of beers and whiskey!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What an amazing place to eat at .  We stayed  at Paris hotel a couple of weeks ago , and just happened to walk by this awesome place  before going to see Jennifer Lopez at Planet Hollywood.  We didn't have dinner reservations so we found 3 seats at the sushi bar.  Everything was incredible ! We ordered the salmon rolls , the crab roll and the spicy tuna rolls and the volcano roll which is hot and deep fried on the outside. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and I have to admit this was the very best I have ever had . Not only is the food awesome but the service was outstanding . Our server was excellent , her name was Chika .  She was so attentive and nice . We had a great time watching  Tuan, our sushi chef in front of us making the most amazing sushi just like he was making a work of art . What more can I say . We loved that place and will definitely go there again the next time we are in Vegas . Thanks to Chika and Tuan for giving us a great experience and a delicious dinner!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was really bad. It took our table about 10 minutes to get  water, after being served the edamame, which they provide for free. They also never refilled throughout the meal. 

This is probably the worst sushi I've ever eaten. I love sushi and I feel it's fairly easy to tell if the fish is fresh. This fish was not fresh, nothing was raw and the rolls had so many \"extras\" on them, you could barely see or taste anything. They loooove spicy mayo here too. Do not order the Hot Spring if you don't like mayo. The presentation was horrifying and I sent it back because it was beyond hideous and disgusting."}
{"text":"Sushi really hit the spot. Service was great. Food came really fast. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend for anybody in the area to come by and try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi and oysters do not taste fresh.  Expensive and poor quality.   Selection is limited as well.   Unfortunately, blue ribbon was closed temporarily."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and the presentation was absolutely beautiful! Highly recommend for those hoping to get a tasty seafood fix."}
{"text":"Love this place. It was very accessible, the place was clean  and the food was delicious. The Wagyu beef and Foie Gras sushi is so good!! And Nechar is an excellent sushi chef. He not only make the best sushi but he's very entertaining as well. Our kids loved watching him making sushi. We highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Foie gras oysters, albacore tuna crudo, salmon rolls were all delicious 

Service was fast 

Great for a quick snack and small plates while passing through Paris to Bally's"}
{"text":"Came in to try this place after 10pm and they have a limited menu. No tapas. Service was really slow. Green tea is Ten Ren brand...didn't taste like Japanese Green tea. It tasted more like a watered down Chinese black tea. We ordered the rainbow roll $22 and it was a small  skinny roll. The crab filling still had crab shells. The sushi on top was only three kinds of fish tuna salmon and shrimp. The sushi combo was okay. Not spectacular."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with a craving for sushi while in Vegas. Having eaten a lot of fancy meals in the past week, my boyfriend and I were looking for something more low key. We stumbled upon this place and I was taken in by the awesome authentic looking decor. We were seated with no wait. The service was on point. We each had a sushi roll, a ceviche tuna taco and spicy edamame. Never had edamame served any other way than with sea salt. It was great! I recommend it. And it's ACTUALLY spicy. We were happy with everything. I'm surprised I remembered the name of this place to review it after this weekend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Came here because it had good reviews somehow. The sushi is extremely expensive and the rolls are tiny. The restaurant was mostly empty, yet it took them 30 minutes to make our sushi. My friend got the sushimi salad and she was the LAST one in our group to get her meal. It had 3 slabs of sushimi on it and a handful of lettuce and a tomato slice. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"This place is cool and the sushi is delicious! The decor is colorful, fun and modern...kind of like their sushi! 

My boyfriend and I tried their Sekushi Rainbow rolls which has Alaskan King crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, cucumber, avocado and wasabi tobiko ($22). 

Next we ate the Surf and Turf rolls ($26) with seared wagyu beef, panko shrimp, avocado, black lava salt and truffle oil. The beef was warm and so yummy!

We finished off our meal with the Kimono rolls ($19) with spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, crispy onion, and balsamic sesame. I enjoyed the crispness of the onion and panko shrimp inside the rolls.

All of these rolls were colorful, fresh, tasty and very easy to eat. The ratio of rice versus filling was perfect. The mix of different flavors and textures were amazing! These rolls looked as good as they tasted!

Overall, I found the rolls a bit pricey but I did recognize that these were high quality sushi rolls. They were refreshingly different! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. From New York and have had my range of sushi. This place is nothing special. It's so soon. Three stars that best."}
{"text":"Sekushi was a really fun sushi joint inside the Paris hotel. I absolutley loved the decor and music choice - it felt more like a club or a local joint, than a restaurant inside a casino.

We made reservations for 730 and enjoyed a variety of food. I ordered:
- Pork Gyoza: delicious! and beautifully presented with a flower
- Salmon Nigiri: incredible, fresh and delicious. The salmon was so tender it melted in my mouth
- Kimono Roll (spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, cucumber, balsamic sesame and crispy onion straw) - I didnt really enjoy this roll. The crispy onion on top was almost like hard oatmeal flakes? - it tasted flavorless and was TOO crunchy - to the point of being annoying/painful. It completely brought down the meal for me.

My friend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box. I had her Miso Soup and some of the fried rice - tasty staples.

I also used the Yelp Check-In offer for the free Cheescake or Devil's Pie -- but recieved Mango Mochi instead (they were out of the other two options). Yum! Cool and refreshing.

Also, I'd rank this as more of a $$$ than a  $$ establishment, as most of the options are $10-20 EACH. And unless you only have one sushi roll or two pieces (pieces, not orders), your tab is going to be higher. My final bill was $52.

I don't know that given all of the other Sushi options in Vegas, that I would return, but I can't say I had a bad experience, so I will give this 4 stars."}
{"text":"We got several sushi rolls for the table to share. The king cali roll was great. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out a sushi place for the first time in Vegas ! Did not disappoint-- great music playlist, good service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was delicious! And the most affordable place to have sushi. The fish is fresh, the atmosphere is fun, and the owner was so kind. A must go place for affordable and good sushi!"}
{"text":"Not good for big groups. We had 9 people and took the bar seats. 

The Surf and Turf is better with the wagyu eaten separately. You can't really taste the wagyu when it's eaten with the roll. 

The 12 piece sashimi wasn't bad. The cuts were very thick and pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Located in the Paris hotel, me and my parents ate here after a long exhausting day of exploring Vegas. We just wanted a quick meal. We ordered an eel avocado roll, salmon avocado roll, beef bento box, and the Chilean sea bass app. I did not like how they do not offer brown rice, I find that a little odd. The main reason I am taking the 2 stars off is for the incredibly slow service. My Chilean sea bass came out about 25 minutes after my parents food. I was not happy. But the fish was absolutely delicious and I would order it again if I ever return. The sushi I tasted was just average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch as we just got in and are staying at Paris. It was not busy, we were seated immediately. We were greeted with complementary edamme . I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box, my husband ordered 3 sushi rolls, spicy tuna, scallop, and tuna. 

We did not specify but assumed everything would come out together but the sushi was brought out one roll at a time all before my bento box. My miso soup came out before the rest of the bento box.

My husband enjoyed the sushi. My bento box was good. It included miso soup, a chicken egg roll, a nice sized piece of salmon, steamed white rice, and a mixed green salad. It was the perfect amount of food for lunch. Our bill was 55 dollars before tip."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Be careful tho, it can get pricey fast. The Wagyu beef skewers are a must. The Toro sashimi just melts in your mouth. I also really enjoyed the rainbow roll here. But that's easy since everything was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place. There's alot of odd decorations but gives a cute charm to the restaurant. The blocks of chairs are so heavy and annoying to pull out or push in!

I wish had more to eat but was satisfied with all the sashimi we ordered. The fish was really fresh and tasted great. The miso soup was a little bland and watery. But the salmon and yellowtail in particular were my favorite. 

Service was fast and efficient. Our sashimi and rolls came out like 15 minutes later. It's very convenient as a to-go or quick stop kind of place. The restaurant is quite small. Not really meant for romantic dates."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but they have a lot to work on. I just learned that it's only been open for 6 weeks, so they are clearly still working out the kinks:

The good:
-Fresh quality fish
-Oyster special totally worth it (learned about it from a family at the table next to us): 12 oysters for $24
-Friendly service 
-Quick seating; there were a couple of tables available (while some of the other restaurants in the vicinity had long wait lines)
-Interesting menu
 
The \"needs improvement\"
-While service was friendly, it was very spotty and inconsistent. They cleared dishes quickly (for the most part) but some items took a very long time to arrive.
-A couple of the oysters were a little weird...they were fresh, but a few of them had some inedible portions (that were not pieces of shell).
-Chirashi was mostly rice and very little fish; not the ratio that one expects for the price.
-Again - the quality of the fish was fresh, but nothing about the food screamed extraordinary.

It's Vegas. Gotta raise your game if you're going to survive."}
{"text":"Nice food. Cheesecake is nice and smooth.  Recommended! Surely will come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a great place... fish was wonderful, rice wasn't great but not terrible. Great selection and open fairly late. Wifey and I had uni shooters(which were outstanding). Don't miss out on this place, just outside of Paris casino. 

Will b here every trip to vegas!!"}
