{"text":"First time ordering here. Ordered pulled pork, veal and Italian sausage sandwiches with a poutine.  Big portion but lack taste, sauce and felt it was poorly made.

Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken sandwich and the steak sandwich. Both are good, I don't think I could recommend one over the other. The food is prepared fresh so it's not as fast as I need it to be when I'm taking a 30 min lunch break."}
{"text":"A classic sandwich..  A good alternate to California whenever you are in that neck of the woods. They use fairly decent quality chicken, I get it hot with sweet peppers and onion."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are \"meh\". Tasteless lacking salt. Over deep fried crap,  go to California's hopefully the . The staff didn't have change for my $20. Gave me a bunch of nickels.  Is this franchised ?  Because they ain't Italian and don't know what it's suppose to taste like.  Nice Reno though.  Could be good with the right people."}
{"text":"It's not rocket science to make a deep fried sandwich and yet somehow this place epically fails. They nuked my pre-deep fried veal sandwich which rendered it a soggy greasy mess. Barely any sauce as well. Terrible."}
{"text":"****NOTE****
On the bad news side, why a pizza and sandwich joint would be completely out of pizza slices, OF ANY KIND, at 1 p.m. with apparently no plan to make any more, (yes I asked) is beyond me.
****NOTE****

But otherwise another great experience at San Francesco's, at least partially because I now remember to outsmart their mistakes, LOL

The good news is there's a ton of veal on the \"hot veal\" sandwich and lots of peppers to add the heat, it just needs more sauce, so I always ask for a little extra ON the sandwich.

The other good news is the meatball sandwich has improved, and even though they are still deep frying the meatballs, they are not turning them into chewy nuggets, they were quite tender and yummy, this time out.

And seriously? You don't cut the sandwiches in half? Fortunately this time I remembered, as I watched them wrapping the sandwiches, to ask for them to be cut in half, to save the wrestling match later.

Overall, very good food. I love the pizza slices (when available), and the sandwiches are generous and delicious. And I 100% disagree with another reviewer, adding any more salt to these sandwiches would ruin the sweet flavor of the tomato sauce, but adding sauce DOES improve the overall flavor of the sandwich.

There just is a need to have a look at the sauce issue on the veal sandwich in particular, make a few pizza slices for the 1pm lunch crowd, and cut the sandwiches in half automatically, don't make me beg, LOL"}
{"text":"Very good veal sandwich. Usually get the baby sized veal with mushrooms, onions & mozzarella. Good sandwich, but pretty messy- you won't be eating & driving at the same time!

Hit & miss on the staff's ability to ask if you want the spicy or regular sauce. Most times they have not asked & just given me the regular. One time they didn't ask & gave me the spicy, which I didn't like. Hence 3 stars instead of 4.

Haven't tried anything else on the menu yet.

Very close to my place, sandwich is good, so I'll be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The food here wasn't as expected from what we had heard from the original location. My wife ordered the veal sandwich and I ordered a pizza. It took 25 minutes to get our food despite asking how long it would take (they said 7 minutes). The pizza wasn't worth ordering (tasted like a decent frozen pizza at best). The veal sandwich was much better but still nothing to go out of your way for. First and last time going here."}
{"text":"First time at this local joint and I was very pleased with the decor, furniture and cleanliness. Their wide menu offerings vary from classic Italian sandwiches and lasagna to poutines and gelato. I ordered the classic veal sandwich with zucchini (+1$). I didn't really enjoy it, I found the veal very greasy and dry tasting. Luckily I added a vegetable in, which I highly recommend because meat + bread can get really tiring to eat. My friends ordered the roast beef and crispy chicken, they looked much more appetizing than mine so try those out! If you're looking for a nice side the fries are very crispy and delicious too.

The highlight of these sandwiches are that they are HUGE. You really get your money's worth here, so if you can't eat a lot I recommend ordering the baby sandwich. I will definitely be doing that next time as I only ate half of the regular sized one."}
{"text":"I have had the veal sw and pizza slices from this location. The pepperoni slices were tasty but a bit light on the red sauce, but still better than ur typical franchise or cora pizza slice.  You are better off ordering a fresh personal pie.  Lasagna was a disappointment- small portion sized that came with no bread - wtf? how am i suppose to mop up the red sauce? why bother as the sauce was sour and not like nona used to make.  you would pay extra for cheese, extra for bread, etc before you have what I would consider a proper meal that was filling.

Finally, the veal sw tasted a bit dried and undersauced, which seem to be a pattern at all San Francesco locations.  You would have to order extras in order to get a proper sandwich.  You are better off at California Sandwiches for a better veal sandwich experience and value.  Altogether, my opnion of this franchise is that they nickel and dime you on everything in the pursuit of profits.  Why don't they just focus on making a good and consistent product that provides customers with value and then the profits will come.  Make sense owner?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and perfect location. Can't ask for more. The service was a little touch and go at times but I feel like I'll be improving my rating as time goes on and they settle in to the new location. 

Got the Pulled Pork sandwich with coleslaw, and it was all delicious. The sandwich was huge, and I really got my money's worth by the time I finished it. I even bit off a bit more than I could chew because I also ordered a poutine. Could barely finish both, although I did because they would so good :) 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a well made sandwich and is hungry for a lot of food. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I came in for a Crispy Chicken Sandwich, it was terrible, definitely the worst I have ever had. Clearly the meat was microwaved, not crispy, it was tough and chewy, the bun was so soggy that the sandwich fell apart the second I tried to eat it. The quality of the chicken was sub par and was very thin and dry. The cost for what I received was ridiculous. What a waste of money! Not sure what the positive reviews from others is all about!!"}
{"text":"First I was second in line to order and the lady from the back came to the front and took the 3rd persons order! 
Then
I ordered a regular veal sandwich and baby veal sandwich and they overcharged me! I didn't realize until after I had left! I paid $
What a rip off for a sandwich that was mushy and not that great tasting! 
Don't bother wasting your money here! 
I'd rather go to California Sandwiches on warden & Eglinton!!"}
{"text":"Came here today got veal sandwich with grilled eggplant and provolone cheese. Oh man so much food and soo good! I always get extra sauce in the side for dipping! In totally I spent $14 and I was not hungry for the rest of the day! 

Their veal is so good because it's thinly sliced and not super tough like many other places I have tried veal sandwiches. 

I highly recommend going here if you feel like a veal or even eggplant sandwich!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be short and sweet the veal is-not veal it is  beef call inside round that inner thigh. Even though it's not veal The last thing you ever wanna do is deep fry it. It will completely destroy that piece of meat. But I think my blast all the original recipes from the original stores on Clinton the original family Sold the business in the late 80s it's never been the same sense"}
