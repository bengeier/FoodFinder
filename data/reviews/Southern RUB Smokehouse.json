{"text":"Very nice BBQ place, it's small but the service is friendly and fast. My favourite are their ribs with medium sauce. Not too spicy, but has nice tang. Great place for take-out."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ is all of the GTA. We drive about 40 mins just to get here and its always well worth it. 

The ribs are the best. Smoky, tender and full of flavour. Nick will always make sure that your food is the best quality. The potatoes are my fave and the mac and cheese is a must have. The brisket is the best. Never dry. 
The wings are to die for. When we go there, we order a bit of everything. including pulled pork poutine. 

If you want the best BBQ ever. This is the place. I just wish they were open on sundays so we could go more often."}
{"text":"Going into this place, it has an Ol' Southern Comfort/Sports Bar environment to it.  Southern Comfort comes from a select few posters of classical Jazz musicians hanging on the wall and I even saw a small Trombone too.  

The musical consisted of a mix of R&B, Jazz and Country and when I sip my Iced Tea I can feel myself on a porch in the South on my rocking chair just passing time.  It helped that this place was on a corner spot with large windows where I can see the sun and shade on this beautiful Sunday.

When you first walk in there is a natural path directing you to the register otherwise indicated with large lettering 'TAKE OUT'.  Being the first one to be here at lunch on Sunday 12:50 pm as they listed 1:00 pm late open, I said I would have the meal on the premises.

Once again I sat down facing the Flat-Screen LCD showing some Golf highlights as the Masters are still commencing.  Here's where the Sport Bar feel comes in as even though this is a \"Smokehouse\", it did not SMOKE up the dining area like other BBQ places.  There was plenty of signs promoting Daily House Specials and Wine/Beer Specials.

Note: I do not consider myself a BBQ expert by any means.  Please take my words as considerations rather than advice.  I eat BBQ maybe 3 times a year.

I ordered the Medium sauced 1/4 Rack Rib & Beef Brisket with Corn Bread and 2 selection of sides.  I started with the Beef Brisket covered in BBQ sauce and felt it to be on the dry side but the RIBS were JUICY and didn't fall off the BONE until you nudge it a little.

There were 3 Bones on the 1/4 Rib and every one I teared into had some fat that complemented the meat and sauce quite well.  The corn bread came from a small tray sitting on the counter and was wrapped with plastic wrap, it doesn't have the same taste as the warm and fresh ones.

I got the Baked BBQ Beans and I can guess it came out of a can but MIXED with a tiny bit of Pulled Pork leftovers and I can see Onions in there too.  It's Baked Beans and came in a round ramekin, enough said!

I was IMPRESSED with the Mac & Cheese served as a side in an oval ramekin with just a bit of sharp Cheddar melted on top.  I tasted it and it had just enough bite (Al dente) to let my mouth feel the rounded shape slither in my mouth.  

The Bechamel had a good consistency and perfectly coated each Macaroni and it wasn't over sauced as I took the last bite and there were barely any sauce on the bottom of the ramekin.

I would go back to try the DRY Ribs next time as they have the option of WET or DRY.  Mac & Cheese would also be on my list as well as the Hush Puppies that I overheard another customer speak of.  The Rib & Beef Brisket Combo was $14.99 and it did fulfill my empty stomach.  

I'm just thinking now how much of that MAC & CHEESE I can take down next time as it was so SMOOTH and SILKY and for $1.99 I would order it as a SIDE ORDER to my Mac & Cheese side."}
{"text":"i've only ever had the pulled pork sandwhich but it is very good.  if i recall it is also very reasonably priced.  the mac and cheese side is creamy goodness.  i always order take out but the place is clean and has a big screen tv."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is solid, but I give this place extra credit for the attention given to side dishes, such as the green beans, salad, and mac-and-cheese.  Also my wife isn't into BBQ but she's happy with the 1/4 chicken or battered and fried fish."}
