{"text":"Arrived at the parking lot and at first wasn't sure if we went to the right place. You cannot see their restaurant sign at all during night time. It is not even lit up and font is small. First thing you notice upon entering is that the restaurant decor is quite unique as it is Victorian style and you can see that it is a high end restaurant. HOWEVER, many of the regular Chinese restaurants are far better than this one. 

A 5 cm ROCK was found in my E-mein noodles!!! 5 cm!! How the hell did it get in there? No one knows. The waiter said it might have fallen from the ceiling!!! That is just disgusting and I am lucky that I saw it before it went into my mouth. No manager or chef came to apologize. Waiter just said he gave it to the manager to investigate. More like throw it out and pretend nothing happened!! Asked to speak to the manager or chef but they just ignored my request!! Did not replace the dish either. 

Food portion was small but expensive! The abalone was quite hard as well.....! Once I got home, I felt really thirsty.... Lots of MSG! 

The service was bad. We had 12 people at our table but they only served us 11 plates and only realizing their mistake after serving. We let the first time go, but it happened again twice after! They told us they will grab another portion from the other table....... Pretty pathetic. 

When we sat down, the waiter told us not to shift our chairs as it would mess up their placing on the table. Why do we need to adjust to the setting on the table... We should be able to sit comfortably! Some people just like to have more space. Plain nonsense! 

Will NEVER go to this restaurant again nor recommend it to anyone. All the restaurant has is the looks. You are definitely not getting what you paid for. The food is really average but they charge you double the price! I'm not sure how a PIECE OF ROCK ended up in my noodles and quite amused that no one noticed it nor acknowledge their fault. And for a ROCK to fall down from the ceiling... does not seem like a safe building. Definitely not a high end restaurant and will just deceive you with its looks. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I suggest reading the 3-star reviews and below on Crown Prince before you decide to go, because I paid more attention to the 3-star and above reviews and after my experience there I feel that I should've taken my own suggestion to avoid a colossal letdown. 

Yesterday was my first time visiting this restaurant and I picked an awesome day to try it out: Chinese New Year Day!  I actually went early in the morning before they opened their doors at 9:00 AM, and there was already a line up!  As soon as the doors open people just started flooding in and I knew at that point not to expect too much on this visit.

I ordered 5 items of dim sum and the last one arrived at my table almost 1 hour  after I had placed the order. Maybe it was a special dish they make in batches at a certain time. It was the crispy pumkin with mushroom something-something.  Anyways, one minute after that dish arrived at my table, one of the managers came up to me and said that I had to pay my bill soon cuz I've been sitting for over an hour and I can't take my sweet time to eat  cuz it was new years.  Of course, this conversation happened in Cantonese. I thought to myself, WTF?  I understand they wanna turn tables but there's a better way to ask.  Some restaurants place the bill on your table and say thank you.  

If that conversation hadn't happened, I would've given this restaurant a three-star at most just for the food and somewhat okay service.  To be fair, there was an older manager who seems to have more experience in the restaurant business that was more helpful.  When I was looking around to flag someone, he took notice and  came up to my table to ask me what I needed. I'm not going to blow this incident out of proportion but it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth to be accused of squatting when I was waiting for the last dish to come out. It's not my fault their kitchen is slow.

That issue aside, the food is okay and they're priced okay as well at $2.80 for S, M, L and they have some unique items on their menu.  I noticed a lot of pumpkin based dim sum and I really wanted to try the puff pastry durian dessert thing but I didn't get the chance cuz the manager that tried to kick me out totally spoiled my mood.  

Finally, don't let the decor fool you. This restaurant is not as \"upscale\" as it looks; it's all a facade to make people feel comfortable about paying more for what is essentially less.  Fortunately, it doesn't work on me.  That's why I chose to go for dim sum.  I would be dumb to order off of their dinner menu. When you strip away the decor, it exposes the real substance of the restaurant and there's really not much there to differentiate this restaurant from others.  

On a side note, I wish restaurants like Crown Prince and Casa Imperial (possibly related or sharing notes) could be more original with their decor.  Some people associate this classic style with \"upscale\" and \"elegance\" but it looks out of place to me in the 21st century.  Note to the owners of Crown Prince: if you're gonna open another restaurant, please for the sake of this city take notes from the restaurants in Asia who have mastered the art of modern elegance and do your part in bringing Chinese restaurants in Toronto up to the 21st century--not down.

Bottom line, food is acceptable and the prices for dim sum are reasonable, which is probably why this place is busy, but everything else is lacking.  I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"I had been in this place several times. I like the food and price was very reasonable. 

The problems are you always have to wait at least half hour even in non-long weekend, and the service was a bit rough...last time I ordered a tentacle and it took long time to get it and was a bit cold... I guess the waitress forgot it.,,,

I will try some other dimsum place...I think the service can be improved!!!"}
{"text":"Very good dim sum place. The durian puff pastries were awesome, so was the pumpkin filled pastry. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Too bad the service ruined the overall dim sum experience.  It's a busy place, so I guess that's why the restaurant thinks that rudeness is OK.  First, they lost our carbon copy sheets with our dim sum order.  A waitress came by 10 minutes later, asking where our order was.  We told them they took it.  She said they did not have it, and that we needed to fill out another.  No apology.  Then, we found a hair in the lotus leaf of the sticky rice.  So we showed the manager, who harooomphed, and again, no apology.  This is just restaurant basics!  Too bad, the dim sum is pretty fresh, but the frustration of the service means I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sat morning, arrived at 8:45am and people have already started lining up. By the time it opens at 9am, the line up was huge and the restaurant couldnt accommodate everyone in the line. Felt bad for those at the end of the line.

Anyway, for the early morning special, everything in S, M and L was $3. We also order har gow (XL - $6). Overall everything was good. Not sure about the hype thou."}
{"text":"Poor service, my table full with empty dishes no one clean up.   Dim sum came out very slow, we have cancelled.  Not going to come back."}
{"text":"Disappointing service, particularly from one hostess. Food was mostly hot and fresh, but not super tasty, however overall experience tainted by the bad, snotty attitude of the hostess across a number of interactions."}
{"text":"Recently went for mother's day dim sum and it was crowded.  We arrived at 9:20 and were knocked out of the first seating (they open for the early bird special at 9AM) so we had to wait until a party finished so they could clear the table.  It was a long wait, we didn't get seated until an hour later at 10:15AM.

Compared to many of the other dim sum restaurants I've tried, the early bird special ($2.80 for all sizes) is way worth it.  There were some exclusions like the Chef's specials which included some deep fried items that were only available after 11AM. But all the mainstay dim sum items could be find for $2.80. 

Parking was terrible with so many restaurants in one plaza and everyone driving... my sister had to park in underground of the Buffet King plaza across the street, not terribly inconvenient but not desirable.  

I'm no dim sum connoisseur but a few things were prepared a bit differently, which, in my eyes, added a lot of value to the 2.80 early bird dim sums.
- The har gow (shrimp flour rolls) were packed with a Chinese vegetable with generous-sized shrimps.
- The siu mai was made to look like sushi with a shrimp toothpicked into the centre at the top.
- There was an egg/custard filled bun which I was a fan of. The bun was soft and the custard creamy (much better than most asian bakeries along spadina in toronto)
- There was an angus beef dessert bun (you couldn't really discern that it was top grade angus beef anyway)
- The fried durian rolls that were listed in desserts (someone posted a photo of it) was something to write home about if you're a durian lover like me.  Considering most HK dessert places in markham/scarb charge $5 for anything that contains trace amounts of durian, this was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth goodness!

The décor was incredibly decadent... the entrance wall had gold and mirrored tiles all over, marble tiles over some of the walls, Victorian/English paintings. The dim sum ladies dressed conservatively in French maid uniforms.   

The only reason I dock a 1-star is because it's so hard to track someone down because it's this huge banquet hall (with 2 floors of dim sum service).  At other dim sum places in the GTA, the end of the meal speeds by in a lightning flash with a waiter coming round to tally your bill, you paying and out the door in 5 mins or less. It took us at min. 15 mins to flag someone down to tally up our bill and another 5 for someone to bring us take-out boxes."}
{"text":"ZERO stars (the program requires that you provide at least one star): Don't know about the food at Crown Prince because we arrived at 10:45am for our 11am reservation (that was made 2 weeks in advance), only to find out that having a reservation was irrelevant.  While letting the \"hostess\" know that we had arrived by showing her our name at the top of the reservation list, we were surrounded by hordes of other people also trying to understand how to get a table. There was no \"queue\" or any attempt to assemble an orderly way to be greeted.  Our \"hostess\" not only lectured us (i.e. potentially paying clients) that \"having a reservation did NOT mean that we would get a table\" BUT that there were two SEPARATE systems:  1) getting a number to line-up for a table and 2) the reservations - still not sure what this means????  Then she gave the \"talk to the hand\" sign to signal anyone who tried to ask a question that she was not \"taking\" questions.  Her \"talk to the hand\" sign was especially unique as it looked like the \"putting up of a sail\" as she raised her hand between her side of the face and anyone seeking to understand the chaos.  Her nonverbal cues indicated that having a reservation was irrelevant and anyone having a reservation could not also obtain a number.  So if you DON'T want to dine at Crown Prince, then I would suggest that you make a reservation.   After 30 minutes of being shown the \"hand\" and being ignored, we left still unenlightened with how to get a seat.  Fortunately, we were able to have a lovely CNY lunch at Diana's Seafood where we were welcomed warmly and served amazingly fresh and delicious seafood.

But I don't want to be too harsh a critic regarding the \"hostess\".  She was obviously not trained in the food service industry.  Luckily, there are many restaurants in Toronto who not only serve good food but also value their customers with a welcome greeting even if there is a bit of a wait.  Most people understand how busy CNY is and are fine to wait as long as they are informed and treated politely.  Perhaps the owners of Crown Prince might want to invest in a little bit of training for their \"hostesses\" so that the customers feel valued and the \"hostess\" is shown how to behave professionally."}
{"text":"I have been to many dim sum place but this one had uncooked dish. I think \"uncooked\" sums up the quality of the food, period."}
{"text":"Went to special price morning dim sum. Ordered five dishes.  Two dishes were lukewarm. Service was quick and good and the waitresses were polite. I gave 12%+ tip and got thank you twice.  The dishes cost $3.30 each so they should be really good.  Not all came up to that standard.  
This is what I ordered:
1. Chiu Chow Dumpling: 5 star for quality but the dish was lukewarm.

2. Steamed vegetable and mushroom dumpling: 5 star for quality and steaming hot

3. Sticky rice w/meat wrapped in lotus leaf: 1 star for quality, almost no ingredients.  Only sticky rice and egg yolk and 3 very tiny pieces of diced pork.  Also less than lukewarm.

4. Steamed black chicken with cordyceps: 4 star for quality.  Chicken was too tough (maybe too old)

5. Sea food and sea cucumber dumpling (only 3 per dish): 3 star for quality.  Too similar to Har Gow 

With tip we paid $25 and it wasn't worth it.  Much better quality, selection and value in Richlane.

We might give it one more try."}
{"text":"This is our dim sum place of choice when we want to make a good impression on guests without breaking the bank. Their $2.80 special is reasonable, compared to the obvious drop in quality at other places where prices are only slightly cheaper. Get the siu mai, thousand-layer egg yolk and custard cake, pumpkin fried dumpling, and har gow!"}
{"text":"We had our company dinner at this restaurant a couple years ago. It's one night that our staff most looked forward to every Christmas.I was the one who did the booking. The dinner for 10 was $800+ (not cheap right?) including tax but not including tips. There was abalone and some other expensive ingredients but in terms of the number of dishes, there weren't too many. I asked the booking staff if that would be enough for a party of 10 (as most Chinese banquets usually have well over 8-10 courses but this one was less). The staff said,\" Don't worry! It's good for 10 very muscular guys.\"

We had 4 guys and 6 ladies. We finished all the desserts and I could see that our staff were not full (neither was I and I'm not even a big eater). We had to order a couple more fried rice and noodles to quench the hunger. When the bill came I thought they would do something to our complain about not enough food. Nothing! Anyway my boss was nice enough to tip $100 as he thought it's no fault of the waitresses who served us (now I even wonder if the tips would go to the waitresses!). When I went out to get the bill (we paid and the receipt never came, so I had to go to the front counter to ask for the bill), I was told that at this all inclusive price, they don't issue receipt. What kind of sketchy business is this? It's our company dinner and we couldn't get a receipt to voucher??!! I suppose they didn't remit tax either. 

It never crossed my mind to write a review about this sketchy tax evasion incident of Crown Prine until a friend of mine told me a similar experience of getting 10% off but was told that a receipt couldn't be issued. That's really worth a visit from Revenue Canada!"}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum I've had in recent memory. All the traditional favorites are delicious and just a bit better than the average dim sum place in Toronto (which honestly has a high concentration of good Cantonese restaurants in North America). Stand-outs include:

-- Fung Jao was falling-apart tender, and the sauce was very, very tasty indeed. 
-- Pumpkin/corn congee -- nice spin on traditional congee, I thought it was very fresh tasting and delicious. Although my parents thought it was a touch bland.
-- Seen Juk Guen -- yummy sauce again, especially with the knot of glass noodles that soaked it all up.
-- Egg custard bun - the filling was extra rich, in a good way.
-- Tea -- they don't skimp on the good tea here. We had sau-mei and it was awesome, even after a few water infusions.

I mean, every single plate that came was stunning and we ordered about 13 plates for 5 people. We were stuffed. And at $2.80 for S/M/L (cash only)? No wonder the entire parking lot was full at 9:30am.

The ambience/decor was a lot nicer than the typical Chinese restaurant too.

Dinner-wise, I wasn't as impressed with this place, so I knocked off a star when I otherwise would have given this place a 5.

The \"ging do pai gwut\" had a tasty sauce but it was way too boney and had very little meat. The \"hor yeep fan\" (rice in lotus leaf) was just OK, it had crab and shrimp but I didn't get much of the lotus leaf flavor. The \"gwai fei gai\" (steamed chicken) had good flavor but the meat was pretty chewy, not very tender. The \"seung tong dow miu\" (snow pea leaves in broth) was pretty good but nothing special.  My dad initially wanted steamed fish but backed off when an ordinary bass was going to cost $48/pound -- I mean, really?!?  Anyway, the dinner scene wasn't great value but definitely come here for dim sum."}
{"text":"TL:DR 
SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE! Would not recommend...

I took my girlfriend and her 88 year old grandmother for dimsum yesterday and had the worst experience. Don't get me wrong, it's forgivable when people make mistakes here and there because we're all human. 

We've been here before and it wasnt that bad but i couldn't believe what really happened to us that day. There were too many mistakes and the attitude along with it making the experience unbearable.

First of all we arrived around 11:45am and got seated. The service was ok at first. The standard what tea \"would you like...\" was asked as we sat down we were looking for the menu to order our food. No menu found on the table. 10 mins later our tea arrived and still no menu was given. I looked for a waitress and they ignored my attention. Great start to our morning...

Eventually getting getting the menu along with some attitude... not even apologizing for anything we decided to order. Whatever, they're busy we understand. 

After placing our order a few minutes later our food came out. But the problem now.... it's not what we ordered. The servers came out with the food, placed the food on the table and tried checking off the food of our menu. They couldn't find it because we didn't order any of it as we explained polity. More food arrived that didn't belong to us, they got frustrated at us for no reason giving attitude. OK fine we're ok with it. There's a big mix up and they want to get the problem solved as we're extremely hungry. 

45 minutes in we still didn't get 3 of our items, including a congee which the grandmother wanted to eat. The grandmother was upset so I decided to rush the items out by asking one of the waitress to look into our order.

Eventually all 3 items came in shortly but one of them wasn't ours and was given to the table behind us... We waited another 10 minutes and got fed up. We wanted to cancel it if it wasn't coming. We asked a manager to see if we can cancel the order and she said no... seriously? She said she can't cancel it but if we want to pay we can get the bill. With that being said... we said we would wait for the item. Shortly after it came, we asked for the bill and got boxes to take the remaining items home.

The bill showed up and we were charged extra items on our bill... my girlfriend took it up with the cashier and got that resolved. Being frustrated already with all our services and experience here, they did not deserve a big tip. Total was approximately $77 which wasn't a problem. She left a 3 dollars for tip and some service.... 

As soon as the cashier looked at what she left she got a waitress to chase her with the bill and demanded a 10% service charge. The menu never stated there's a service charge. Tips are optional depending on service as its our discretion. A manager came and explained we didn't pay 10% service charge. That just made my girlfriend so furious and she argued that the service wasn't deserving of our tip. It was a stalemate... they assumed we'd comply with the service fee. Eventually she said ok and let us leave....

Honestly with all that happening to us, do you think they deserve a tip?"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. Atmosphere was great,  food was fresh and taste great. The only reason I take away two star is because of the service. I came here for dim sum two days in a row. The first day we order a turnip cake and ask for oyster sauce,  the waitress is really nice and gave it to us.  But the second day,  I order the same dish and ask for the same oyster sauce,  the waitress (another one) said they don't have it and just walk away. She was busy and just don't want to get it for us.  Prior to that, we put in an order and 2mins later ask to cancel it bc we kinda order too much. The same lady said she can't cancel it. Seriously,  it's not like I never been to other restaurant,  if the time is not long they should be able to do it.  But she just don't want to bother; and don't want to walk to the counter and cancel it, we didn't make a big deal and just let it go. But the oyster sauce I really can't eat the turnip cake without it,  so I ask another waiter,  a male one,  he was able to get it for us within a minute .  Which prove the other waitress I ask just didn't want to help.  Service here depends on who u ask."}
{"text":"If you can get over the hideously tacky decor and the expensive prices that they charge here for average quality dim-sum, this restaurant is not bad for an early lunch.

Everything ordered on a weekday before 11:00am is a special \"early bird\" price of $2.80 a plate (instead of different prices depending on the dish), but feel free to sit around and eat at your own pace once your order has been made.

The food is decent but overpriced for what it is. They try to compensate for this by serving everything on beautiful dishes and their \"elegant\" decor."}
{"text":"I went to this absolutely beautiful restaurant with my family for dim sum. Service was amazing, decor was the most impressive and washrooms were very clean. There were no pushcarts for dim sum but it came out very fast and were still hot when they came out. Food was really good, our table ordered almost everything on the dimsum menu and we finished it all. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was quite an experience to eat Dim Sum for $2.80/dish at this over the top decorated (chandelier overload) establishment, which almost made me feel as if I should be wearing designer duds rather than my parka and salt stained boots. 

If you order before 11am you get the $2.80/dish special, which I am going to assume is popular because this place was jam packed on a random weekday morning. Doesn't anybody work? 

It was quite a challenge choosing what dishes to get because everything tempted me. I wanted to get one of each, but there is only so much 2 girls can eat. We got a variety of things, but the highlights for me were the the shrimp dumpling with scallop, shrimp and mushroom steamed flour roll, and the pan fried short ribs. (So tender) 

The pumpkin and corn con gee was good, but I wish it had been hotter (in temperature), the shrimp dumplings kept sticking to each and fell apart when picked up (but that might just be my lack of dexterity with chopsticks). I talked my friend into ordering the pumpkin and shrimp crepe because it looked like a popular choice amongst the other diners. It was a bit too glutinous and reminded me of something I would have for breakfast. Not my favourite. The durian pastry was stinky and creamy which can be a good thing or a bad thing - depending on how you feel about pastries that smell like they've gone bad. 

All in all, I had a pleasant experience dining here and am sure to return (specially since its in my 'hood) whenever I feel the need to get my Dim Sum fix in \"classy\" place."}
{"text":"really nice looking place. We went for dim sum and we got the morning special before 11am, which is much cheaper. They still charge you for tea when you sit regardless of if you want it or not.  so we got the flower tea! 
we went on Friday and Sunday morning.  weekends are much more busier and crowded. It seems like they let people send a person to camp when they open and reserve a table for the rest of their (late nonpresent group). We are all present on Saturday but all the tables were filled.  felt kind of unfair.  
so make sure you go early early early like 9.
You order from a paper when you start and they slowly bring it out one by one.  
The food was so good and big and I felt great afterwards. food def worth it vs the price when you get the special.  Any other time I think it would come out to twice the price.
Make sure you also check on what you get vs order so they don't forget to serve you an item but still accidentally charge you extra. almost happened."}
{"text":"I have been craving dim sum for some time, and finally we organised a big enough group to go (you want at least 4 people so you can get a variety of dishes!). Arriving at 0930h on a weekend should get you a table with minimal wait, though that might be a bit early for some brunch-goers. The decor screams tacky Trump palace, and the cup/plates/chopsticks all have gold trims. Waitresses are dressed like French maids. We were able to put in our order quickly and the dishes started arriving slowly. The tea is awesome as it actually tastes like tea!

The first dish served was the Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles (XL), which I find are one of the best in the city. With no batter and a slightly sweet and savory coating/rub, the tentacles were tender (though could have been a bit hotter in temperature). Other must-tries (from today) include: 
(1) Dim sum staples Har Gow (XL) - larger in size compared to other restaurants and flavour is good, stuffed with at least 3 shrimps in each dumpling...I would argue the wrap could use a little more work as it falls apart and sticks together very easily;
(2) Seafood and Sea Cucumber Dumpling (L) - I can do without the green colouring on the wrap, but the caviar on top gets bonus points;
(3) Steamed Bun with Custard and Egg Yolk (L) - this is like the Chinese version of lava \"bun\";
(4) Pan Fried Sweet Almond and Peanut Pancake (L) - chewy glutinous crepe rolled with sugar, coconut, sesame, almonds and peanuts filling;
(5) Steamed Lamb Meat (L) - explosion of flavour...this is probably a lamb stew that has been simmering for hours with spices like cumin, cardamon, cloves, bay leaves etc. The lamb is on top of a bed of water chest nuts and soybean wraps.

Other honorable mentions (from today): Sweet Egg Yolk Paste Layer Cake (L); Steamed Shrimp and Veggie Rice Roll (XL); Steamed Bean Curd Rice Roll (L); Steamed Beef Offal with House Stock (L)

Nothing to write home about:  Shrimp Roll with Salad Dressing (L) - looks like a fish stick, but is actually shrimps and Miracle Whip, battered and deep fried; Mango Pudding (M) - tasteless, despite the evaporated milk, and poorly presented

Our only complaint is that the Siu Mai (L) which we ordered shortly after we sat down, never came despite reminding multiple waitresses on multiple occasions. This still had not arrived by the time we settled our bill at around 1130h.

I would definitely come back as it is a different experience every time with the vast variety of dishes and the myriad of combinations for weekend brunch! See you in a few weekends?"}
{"text":"This is really 3.5 stars, bumped up to four in a process of bell curving my grades for dim sum because there is so much bad dim sum in Toronto and not enough good. I mentioned recently to a friend in food procurement that it was beginning to feel like all dim sum in Toronto was beginning to look and taste exactly the same. He replied that in fact it was exactly the same for many restaurants, he's been to the warehouse that distributes the dim sum in frozen crates to the restaurants.

Not so at Crown Prince, they actually make their dim sum. 

This means that some of it, like the shrimp hargow, is exemplary, large parcels bursting with shrimp flavour. And others of it, is not so exemplary, like the scallion ginger tripe which was a bit on the hard to chew side. Overall the food quality was very food, tasty, and well presented.

If you get your order in before 11am the dishes are on special for $2.80 each.

Another plus at the Crown Prince, the staff (though dressed like Asian goth dolls) are very friendly and efficient.

As for the decor, it's very Hong Kong. If you've never been to Hong Kong, think Vegas."}
{"text":"I went there today Sunday( Dec 11, 2016) at 9:15am, no waiting. good Decor, clean, good quality food. The washroom was clean and smell good ( some Chinese restaurant's washroom is smelly and not clean ). the staff member were welcoming and keep refilling my teapot with hot water. since, it was not busy yet my order came to my table within 5 min. When you eat in high class restaurant you feel good and feel you are important. very elegant place. This Christmas indulge yourself and love one and visit the place. ( be  early bird, though)"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum. Particularly enjoyed the shrimp and scallop dumplings. Order by the menu, no push carts. 

Recommended if you are looking for pricer dim sum, L- 4.80 a plate. Many items are XL, SP and J??? Fried short ribs not as good as Casa Imperial.

Victorian-esk decor that, for lack of a better word, is i-n-t-e-r-e-s-t-i-n-g."}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite dim sum spot! Although the selection is limited in the morning (cheaper before 11AM), everything tasted amazing. I got here around 9:30AM for breakfast/lunch and it was packed by 10:00AM, with a long line up by the entrance. The service was understandably not as speedy as dinner, when there was only a few tables. 

I love the bird's nest egg tart - two of them are made with egg whites and two with egg yolk. For dinner, you must try their Peking Duck - It looks small when they bring it out, but it tastes so nice and plump when it's in your flour wrap. The price of the Peking Duck is only $40 as opposed to $56 charged by Casa Imperial Fine Dining (see my other review).

The lavish interior is definitely set to wow customers. Crown Prince would be a perfect venue for a wedding dinner. The waiter mentioned they have another location that's furnished even more ridiculously bourgeois - I've got to try it out!  

I don't need to write a super long review for Crown Prince as everything speaks for itself once you've been there. And, thank goodness dim sum accounts for two meals, or else I'd gain so much weight!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. We had a meal here with friends and had the banquet menu. The dishes were substantial and was good and authentic. I believe it is reasonably priced as I did not pay for the meal. My friends have frequented the place and found it inexpensive compared to some other Chinese restaurants. They often bring their grandkids who are able to run around. We had lobster, chicken, fish, prawns, soup, vegetables , fish maw, some kind of shellfish, beef and more. Plenty for a table of 10.
I did not like the decor. The place was a little over decorated. The toilets were clean. But we were here for the food."}
{"text":"Best dim sum spot in the GTA. Crown Princess is the sister restaurant downtown.

Prices are slightly more expensive but the food is simply better than your typical dim sum restaurant. 

The must have for desert is the white bun with egg yolk inside (can't remember the name). When you take a bite, a river of sweet yolk spills out. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love to come to this place for early dim sum...great food, price and dim sum.
The har gow, scallop dumpling, char sui so and durian pastry are sinful!"}
{"text":"So with LWH being too far, and Spring Villa closed temporarily for renos, my family decided to meet up for lunch at Crown Prince. My dad actually came here the night before and was pleased. We were all very excited to try this place out, especially because we had always heard good reviews for the downtown location. So, reservations were made for 11AM lunch on Sunday.

Of course it would be a zoo here. Parking was a mess and of course we had to wait for quite a bit even though we had reservations. Now my family knew how others were made to feel at LWH or Spring Villa where we don't make reservations, but management always has a table ready for us...even if it means taking away a table that was already reserved. That's what happens when you are a regular.

Now, on \"the other side of the table\" we were kept waiting despite being repeatedly told that our table was \"being fixed.\" We had a great corner table though. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant is decorated with chandeliers, faugh gold-guilded chairs, paintings of Napolean speaking in Chinese, paintings of beautiful Victorian mansions with a Chinese Duchess...okay I'm being a tad bit sarcastic, but ENOUGH! What's wrong with minimalist and tasteful décor? Perhaps this location is following suit with their downtown counterparts as Crown Princess on Bay has frickin Parisian marble columns. Also, anyone been to Casa? Yes, you don't get Chinese teapots here - you get fanciful English teapots with pictures of Greyhounds and British aristocracy riding on their horses...

Ok, enough hating. The food. BIG! The Siu Mai and Har Gow were so big that I couldn't fit one piece whole in my mouth. But I have to say the selection is much larger here than at both LWH or Spring Villa. And for that, I can see why this place is so packed and popular. We also ordered the Pumpkin/Squash (?) congee which was so healthy and delish that I could imagining myself just eating the whole pot. We ordered a lot of fried stuff this time, but YOLO.

Overall, I paid (it was my turn to take the fam out) $160 including tips which I found pricey. My family complained, and I too, that the food was really salty (in other words, MSG). The service is not just up to par, but perhaps, I am missing all the service we get at LWH and Spring Villa. I hate how sourly the wait staff are here. And because we don't know head management, it's not like we get any special treatment. So for that, I am not liking this place. I am biased for sure, but we all start out new so my family weren't made to feel anything but superstars at LWH or Spring Villa. That's why, aside from the food, we kept on going back.

Not coming here anytime soon, but that's not to say that the food isn't good (although MSG, in our opinion/minds) and for some people who wish they could be in the Palace of Versailles, while eating on a Char Siu Bow with chopsticks, than this is your place."}
{"text":"I came here for a pre-mothers day lunch. The interior is pretty but it was this weird French/Egyptian/English theme going on that doesn't make too much sense.  Tried too hard to be fancy but the service is still typically Chinese - extremely poor.  The food is good if you can get in for the early bird special - otherwise, it's a little bit overpriced and you're probably just paying for the \"high class\" decor."}
{"text":"Arrive before 10am if You want to be seated before the 11am early bird dim sum deal ends on weekends. Not kidding.  

Very good quality dim sum.  My suggested items are: 

Ha Chung shrimp rice noodle rolls - big shrimp 

Beef rice noodle rolls - good quality beef with a tiny bit of veggie inside 

Xo sauce beef short ribs - flavourful, but note this is XL size dish so the special small-dish pre-11am price won't apply to this dish

Pumpkin tarts - cute, slightly sweet 

Fried ham soy Gok dumplings 

Average clean washrooms."}
{"text":"This dimsum restaurant is good if you want to eat somewhere nice and fancy. The decor and atmosphere of this place is true to its name, very majestic and of fine air. Everything from the walls to the tables and to the uniforms of the servers brings about a Victorian style era, perhaps a little bit too flashy to some. It can get pretty expensive eating here, so come only if you know you can afford to dish out big bucks from some pretty good food."}
{"text":"Crown Prince has a very extravagant atmosphere, from the moment you walk into the restaurant. Upon walking through the doors, you will see a luxurious purple velvet couch, along with slews of other rich decor and chandaliers. Nothing like the Windsor Castle where Queen Elizabeth lives, but it was still unexpected from a dimsum restaurant.

The china/tea sets were also very unique. I wouldn't say that the dimsum here was the best I have had, but it certainly met my expectations. If you are an early bird, try to come before 11:00AM for discounts on the dimsum. They have delicious bird's nest/egg tarts as well.

Overall, would come again, but I would like to concur with other reviews that this place is more well known for its extravagant decor than for its dimsum."}
{"text":"For a dim sum, this is one fancy looking restaurant. From the decor to the bowls and teapots, everything is so classy. I often come here just to see the restaurant itself. The food is decent - it's nothing spectacular, but at least it's not tasteless/poorly cooked. The cost is priced differently depending on what time you go at ($2.80/dimsum dish before 11am). The food itself, is on a medium-high end for dim sum. But friends and family justify by the balance with the decor.  What I do find is that it is hard to catch the waiter/waitress. I had to wait close to 20 minutes just to catch the attention of a waiter for getting our bill..."}
{"text":"We only come for dim sum.  Early for the special prices, later if we can't wake up.  Either way, the quality and consistency of all dim sum dishes is very reliable."}
{"text":"I was here for a private party. This place is super fancy. I always say it's better to be overdressed than underdressed and being overdressed would be a challenge in a place this beautiful. I did not know what I was in for as I'd never been to a celebration like this before. There were 10 people per table and a large lazy susan in the middle.

The server set up small plates around the perimeter of the lazy susan. He came back with a large plate of food and divided the whole dish up between all of the plates. He did this for 10 courses. I thought I may die I was so full. Service was excellent.

The food was absolutely incredible. Pork, chicken, duck, scallops, sea bass, lobster all cooked to perfection. The desserts were not my favourite, but I'm more of a sugary sweet dessert gal. There was red bean pudding, black sesame/coconut jello and almond cookies. Not that I had room for any of them!"}
{"text":"I was told I was going to dim sum, so when I walked into this place, I was literally SHOCKED. The decor and the atomosphere was not at all what I was expecting. Usually dim sum places are dirty and you are just there to eat. But this place blows all the other restaurants out of the water. 

As we entered, I swear we were walking into a Vegas club or something!! When we were seated our tea came in a elegant tea pot, not those dirty white ones you usually get. The table was clean and the food, OOOHH THE FOODDD. great portion sizes, awesome service, and TASTY DIM SUMM. I would and have already recommended this place to everyone I know. 

I can't say about the prices as I was treated by my aunt, but I think I would pay a little more to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Awful service. Arrived half an hour after opening time and the place was seated to the brim with a decent waiting line. Was told by the hostess of a wait around 20 mins for a table for 2. Actual time till number was called was close to an hour later. They called out a few numbers successively met with a barrage of folks making a run for the counter. They gave out our table with a pause of less than 30 seconds after the call out; I stalled to make sure an old lady wasn't knocked over by a rude lady rushing forward which incidentally snatched our table queue. Told the hostess that our number was just called n she responded telling us to wait again for a table to come up. Horrible experience and I would not support giving my money to these guys when there are other just as good if not better dim sum places around the corner."}
{"text":"Never expected a place like this here. It is very well designed and impressive.

The interior is designed with top notch Victorian styling, really takes you back to the Nepolienic era. The servers had black and white French styling uniforms. Attention was paid to all the little details such as French fancy teapots. They even have a very fancy and high end downtown lounge feeling waiting area.

The ambiance and feel was very immersive and unexpected for a Chinese restaurant. It was a pleasure just going to Crown Prince. Everything was very professional and gave the impression you were getting good quality food and experience. 

Despite having great presentation the food was just average. However they had these buns which apparently was really good. My parents and sister ate it but I didn't try any. 

The prices are above what you pay at typical Chinese dimsum restaurants but it's understandable because of all the additional costs. Go there before 11:30 am and get their dim sum special.

Overall it was a very good experience. We had to wait over an hour but it was Christmas day so it can be expected.

{"text":"We had our fair share of dim sum all around the GTA. This was one not a good dim sum experience at all for such a pricey place. The service was lacking and the food was lacking favour an freshness. Our beef ribs were raw inside so we send it back to the kitchen and it was still raw the second time. They forgot our siu Mai and BBQ ribs and charged us for it. We left the place disappointed and do not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Came here because it was recommended by my host. Long wait.. waited an hour for 4 people. Rude staff, bad service, and food was not good. The only thing that I could finish was the tripe, soybean dessert, and the fried dough with steamed rice wrap. Chicken feet was bland and straight out of the freezer. The sweet egg yolk layered cake made me gag. Egg yolk baos was not good. Sui Mai was alright. The lady spilled the whole soy sauce on our table.. Tea is calculated by person.. Bathrooms were gross and nasty..never going back, never again."}
{"text":"Pro tip: If you don't want to wait for a super long time, call ahead and make a reservation. They also do flat rate for any size before 11, I believe..but it's a mad house.

Don't travel uptown on a mission for this place and if you are uptown, go to Dragon Boat instead.

Service: for such a fancy place it was fairly impossible to get someone to help clear empty plates to accommodate more food as it arrived. This left me extremely annoyed. Same can be said for topping up hot water in the tea pot. I had to stand and flag to get someone to stop. 

Food: the rice noodle rolls are fairly thick, as was the har gow dumpling. The steamed chicken feet, taro balls, durian pastry and pretty much all the fried items were great.  Their tripe wasn't very tender and their sui mai was just meh. 

Because we came after 11, I paid regular price for the sizes. A mix of mostly dimsum and 3 normal menu items cost me $200 before tip"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese dim sum fare. Some hits and misses, unfortunately the Har gow (shrimp dumpling) was a miss. The skin was way too soggy. The deep fried squid tentacles were great tho. It's a large restaurant so should be easy to get seated if your party is under 6ppl. The service was pretty decent too."}
{"text":"The overly-ripe (it doesn't smell! more of a general 'feeling' of the place!), oddly opulent decor, and the size of the restaurant hits you as soon as you walk in through the doors.  It certainly doesn't look like a typical Chinese restaurant: from the Victorian-inspired decorations, to the 'English' place settings, to the servers in black and white maid uniforms.  My brain was briefly knocked out as all the black and red and gold decor of this dim, cavernous place displaced my expectations of what a Chinese restaurant is supposed to look and feel like.  I like surprises, really, I do!  The atmosphere just felt a bit off to me though.  

I had dim sum there on a Saturday afternoon with my family and we were seated right away.  There were empty tables around us the entire time we were there, which is abnormal during dim sum hours for most Chinese restaurants.  This could be due to how big the place is (doubtful - if a place is popular, people will come!), and more likely due to how pricy the dishes were compared to other Chinese restaurants.  Note: this is a higher end Chinese restaurant (as if the also atypical, younger, prettier servers in maid uniforms rather than the usual older, granny-type servers were to leave you in any doubt).  No carts here!  Order by ticking off what you want from a piece of paper.

The dim sum was OK.  Honestly, typically yummy like dim sum generally is in my books.  We had a riot with the dim sum descriptions in English vs Chinese.  An example in English was something like, deep fried sesame ball with egg yolk.  In Chinese, it was a much fancier and romantic description: Hard outer skin, soft heart.  

Tip: get there before 11am and most dim sum dishes (s, m, l, xl, I think) are all one price at $2.80 each.  Outside of these hours, depending on size, it's much pricier.  If you want to order larger carb dishes, etc like beef noodle, be prepared for prices of $14 and up.  Everything is is pretty much double or triple the price of other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"After trying LWH, this is my second dim sum stop. I can say prince is equally good/fancy.  Overall they are all on par with my favorite in LA. The fancier the better! My tips is that if u have a week long vacation in Toronto, try going in the afternoon on weekdays.  5 star."}
{"text":"I agree with the comments on the gaudy decor. It's a bit too much for some but their dim sum is satisfying. I don't go to dim sum too often so when I do go, I prefer a place that offers large dumplings and is relatively clean. I can't get over how large their har gaos are. I get them every time! Like many other have mentioned, it is cheaper if you go early in the day but the prices are  fair and reasonable later on in the day too. It comes out really cheap if you go as a bigger group!

My go-to dim sum spot."}
{"text":"My dim sum journey continues in the Greater Toronto Area.

We were there on a Saturday morning at 8:30, half an hour before they opened, and were number 4 in line.  By the time they opened their doors the line had formed an \"L\" shape along the parking lot.  The restaurant was completely full minutes after opening.

This is one of many restaurants in the GTA that offers morning tea discount on weekends.  Generally, to qualify for the discount, where L, M and S dim sums are all priced as S, the order ticket must be received by 11am and you have to pay in cash.

Therefore, the dim sum scenes at many restaurants can get rather chaotic at times, especially on weekend mornings.  The best way to avoid the chaos is to arrive before they open.

Most of the staples were great.  The SIU MAI was made with high quality ingredients and had a refined texture.  The BEEF BALLS had a good balance between softness and springiness. The black bean sauce that accompanied the PORK SPARE RIBS was rich in flavors and aroma.

Other than the usual stuff, I was particularly impressed with two items that were quite creative and cannot be found in most places in So Cal.

STUFFED \"COLORFUL\" PEPPERS:  They were stuffed with minced pork (rather than the typical fish paste) and pan-fried to perfection.  It came with two pieces of green pepper, a piece of yellow pepper and another piece of red pepper (hence colorful).  It was served with a delicious black bean sauce on the side.

PUMPKIN and CORN CONGEE:  A creative, healthy and refreshing item that was a much welcomed companion to accompany an indulgence of greasy dim sums and fried foods. It was full of natural sweetness and flavor, although I found the seasoning and saltiness a bit on the lighter side.

In the dim sum battle of Toronto versus Vancouver, Crown Prince is definitely comparable to some of the best in Vancouver, such as Kirin or Sun Shui Wah.  For me at this time, it's a dead heat."}
{"text":"We come here for tea and lunch a lot, one of my favourite places. Their BBQ pork pastry and fried dough is a great thing that should be tried out. Reservations should be made before you come, as it is usually extremely busy, and you'll be waiting for about 40 minutes if you don't make a reservation."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars
Food -- 4 stars
Service, enviro (noisy) -- 3 stars
Parking -- 2 stars, always crowded and you have to fight for a spot.  On the other hand, it's free

Dim Sum Style -- no push carts, you order and they make it fresh for you.  They have early bird special, order before 11:00am and you pay one price for S/M/L/XL dishes.

Quality and Selection -- pretty good quality and ample selection.  Rice rolls, steamed dumplings (shrimp, scallops, veggie, etc.), puff pastries are all good.

Service -- very efficient services if not super warm or friendly.  I recognize a few faces, so I think the managers / key servers have been in the industry for a long time and have worked in other Hwy 7-Markham area spots before.  

Keep this on the to-go list? -- a good spot to go if you like early lunches."}
{"text":"A pretty good place for dim sum. As befitting the name, a somewhat palatial, slightly gaudy European decor of velvet, chandeliers and western porcelain tea sets.  Quite an extensive menu of dim sum choices.

Our favorites: 
Bitter melon with salty egg yolk - I'd love more egg yolk, but as it is still very tasty
Durian danish - flaky with good flavor
Tofu pudding - very GINGERY syrup
Grilled Squid 
Sweet Pancake - with coconut, sesame and peanuts
Thousand layer cake 

Good:
Charcoal BBQ Baby Ribs - Tender meat, good flavor, but is lacking in the charcoal aroma
Tofu rice crepe - more flavorful than you'd expect

Won't order again: 
Pork stomach with black pepper - rather bland unless you bite into a peppercorn
Chicken Feet - too mushy, breaks apart into unshapely lumps
dan dan noodle - a very disappointing version of the noodle"}
{"text":"I came here for early dim sum on a Sunday. We had a party of 15 so we were able to get a wide variety of dishes. For the low price of 2.90, it was a really good deal, but I won't be coming back for regular dim sum. First off, the tea was bland and diluted to water fairly quickly after a few refills of water. The standard dishes were not bad, but for a place with such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more than just average. Their deep fried dishes looked like they were refried or over fried with such a dark brown colour. We also had two dishes that were spoiled, the deep fried taro and sesame balls were sour. Overall, this was quite the disappointment considering the reviews and decor of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Never feel a restaurant more fitting a 3 star rating. I will start with the Pros:
1. It opens at 9am and is big. So if you can get up early, this is a sure place to get a seat, as long as you arrive before 930. If you miss that batch, the wait could be quite long.
2. It is cheap for decent quality dim sum. S,M,L are all the same price if order is made before 11am. However, watch out for misc charges
3. The lamb dish is really nice.

Now the Cons:
1. Hygiene. I noticed food stain on my dish and asked the waitress to bring me a clean one. She sure did, by exchanging with a setting on the next table. I sat in horror watching her serve the next customer with that dirty dish. 
2. Rush and wait. Order fast and then wait patiently for your turn of food, chow down quickly and then pay up the bill. If you can't operate in that pace, well you get the warning. 
3. Disclaimer: not all the waiter / waitresses are like that, I did receive good services sometimes.

I am staying neutral on the debate on decoration. Calling it \"classy\" would be a far stretch, but it beats the red carpet for sure."}
{"text":"This place is my bank managers go to place for dim sum and so we went there today.

The place was really packed on a weekend, and I saw people waiting well over an hour for a seat. Good thing our bank manager knew the owner. Got a fast seat and started ordering. Service wasn't too good. Could be the number of people or understaffed but whatever the reason, we went without tea for quite a long time. We had to get up many times to ask for service. 

We were lucky that day because we were able to see the dragon dance. It was a nice surprise, but a little bit noisy. Other tables kids loved it but as we were talking about business, it was a little bit annoying. Next time only go on a weekday.

Food was fantastic. One thing I would recommend would be the roast duck. Best I ever had. Skip the congee. I don't understand why anyone would like congee for dim sum, but that's my opinion."}
{"text":"This place has great tasting dim sum and a variety of unique dishes... but the service needs improvement.  If you don't know the management here, you may be in for less than adequate service.  Also, don't leave things behind at the table as you won't get it back :)."}

Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can

Once upon a time steamed fish just fell apart
You were holding in your hands and the suckling pig touches my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh!

Ohhhhh...

Once upon a time, we burned thru the rice
Now all we ever seem to do eat once or twice
On and on...
And on and on and on...

Once upon a time on the same side.
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw water on my stain

[Chorus:]
I could've been at the Princes', You'd be a King
Could've had crispy chicken, and probably the wing
But no, you let me go

And stole my star

You stole my star la, la la la la laaaaaa

Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh"}
{"text":"Never coming back again! waited close to 2 hours when the hostess told us it would take about 30 mins.  If you want business, then at least be honest to your customers about the wait time (especially during lunch hour!! We're all hungry LOL).  Don't purposely underestimate the wait time to keep business.  You're going to end up with a bunch of grumpy customers."}
{"text":"This is the dimsum restaurant that my family frequents the most as it's just a five minute drive from home. We usually go on Saturday mornings for weekends or we go on holidays, but like other reviews have mentioned: expect a long wait on weekends or holidays. I've been coming here a while but this is my first review of the place. First things, the place itself is quite spacious and beautiful. The interior has a nice design, similar to that of a Victorian Era feel with chandeliers, fancy lighting, and regal paintings on the wall. The food and service itself is fine, nothing to marvel about but nothing to complain about either - - it is simply satisfactory. I'd recommend this restaurant for those who are in the area and want some dimsum. Lastly, they do accept credit card, credit card, and cash :)"}
{"text":"Rude staff and management does not seem to care even when you complain to them directly. They just shrug it off. When I ask a staff for something, I was told often, \"oh I don't do that, you have to ask someone who does it.\" There are staff who bring out dishes only, staff in suits who just stand around, staff who refill your tea pot, but you don't really know who can fulfill your actual request - quite a guessing game here. No designated server for each table either. 

Even though we got there at 9am when it opened, we were not given the early bird special pricing (S/M/L size dishes at $3.30). Perhaps because it is Father's Day - not too sure, they do not really communicate with you and do not even pretend to even care when you ask. 

You can come here if you don't mind being treated like dirt. There is a nearby dim sum place which I might try out going forward. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite...actually owned by the same owner as Noble Seafood restaurant but I prefer this one. 

We come here mostly for their yum cha. Today was busy but we still got seated within 15 minutes. Aside from the staples, I usually see a few Experimental new items from time to time.  

Today's food-  I like the rice soup. There's generous amount of oyster and the soup is light, non-greasy and flavourful. The deep fried chicken knee was great as well though this may not be for everyone- I like the crunchy texture of collagen lol...we also almost always get the fried bitter melon with the salty egg yolk (i realized that my caption is wrong... it's not thousand years old egg yolk, but the salty duck egg yolk that they used in the coating of the bitter melon)

For dessert, we had maple syrup beehive cake and the walnut pancake rolls. I prefer the pancake but it's kinda messy to eat  

Service- As with any Chinese restaurant, again the food always come out faster than we can consume and the waiters and waitresses were often unsure where they were supposed to put the dishes...half of our party arrived 1 hour late so we couldn't eat everything fast enough, but the head waitress was at least thinking ahead and had them delay the pecking duck till everyone was here.

A note. The servers are very attentive. Even though this is a dim sum style dining, they still help serve the soup, the duck and a few larger items individually for us.  

Decor- over the top gold and red, but somehow it works...I find the level of lighting inviting and warm."}
{"text":"Very fancy interior for a dim sum restaurant! Probably because it is also a banquet for special events. I can never wake up early enough on the weekend to make it for the early bird prices but still, it is worth it.

Recommendations: har gow/shrimp dumplings, egg tart/milk birds nest tart, curry octopus."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum,  everything was very hot and fresh made.   The har gow are GIANT!   The siu mai was a little disappointing since there was no fish row or shrimp on the top.   But other than that every dish was very delicious and well made.   I recommend this place for dim sum and the menu is quite extensive.   Also if you come before 11am all the s, m and l dishes are only $3.50 each.   And the service is very good for a dim sum restaurant,  the wait staff were very attentive to us even though the restaurant was full and had a lineup out the front door."}
{"text":"This place is my family's stable for din sum and dinner. Lots of staff floating about, they always keep an eye on you: tea, empty trays or plates. Food is excellent. Long weekends can be tough with the flow of customers. Aside from that, it's good."}
{"text":"THE FANCIEST CHINESE DIM SUM PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. We always come here when my family comes to Toronto, mostly because I force them to. I think the tea set that are give out are super nice looking and fancy. The wait staff wears fancy maid costumes. 

Tip: Come before 11AM and the items are half off. 

The Har gow are HUGE. I live in the DC area, and our dim sum game isn't that great compared to Canada. The beef tribe has chillis in them and they are super tender with a kick of spice. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Crown Prince has always been one of the better Dim sum places in the city, when it comes to quality, service and environment. It is also why this is slightly pricier then most dim sum places. i went with a smaller group of 3 people. and went for a weekday lunch, and it was packed. If you decide to go to this place during the weekend, you would have to arrive very early, reserve, or hope to god your not hungry, cause its going to be a long wait. 

The dim sum here past 11:00 is always pricier, however the quality is not bad. Outside of their pricing system which has staples like har gow labelled as XL for some reason just to charge you more, and other staples that other restaurants would not dare to label it that price mark. the food is decent. 

the roasted pork is pretty good, and is very crispy. The other dim sum pretty good. some of the ones i would not recommend woudl be the deep fried Taro. which they don't do a good job, and also the spring roll as i would avoid as the spices are not great for it at all. 

Overall with prices and some dishes not really good, it has knocked it from being a 5 star. but i would recommend this dim sum place to people. for those who want a good dim sum places and don't mind paying for it."}
{"text":"Expect long waits during weekend. 

Service sucked. You have to ask for everything and no designated waiter. Rice, utensils, napkins, - had to ask for.

Overall food was okay compared to other dim sum places in the area."}
{"text":"After visiting Crown Prince, I am fairly certain that there is one crazy, dimsum loving Asian out there who has: 
1. A large accounts payable for purple drapes, gold drapes, Victorian art, chandeliers, marble, and French maid costumes
2. A vocabulary that includes, exclusively, fancy but cheesy sounding words such as: Crown, Casa, Prince, Princess, Fine, Victoria, Dining, Premier, Imperial, Banquet
3. Loves serving people dimsum in said fancy but cheesy decorated and titled restaurants
3. Rolling in a bed full of money

I say this, because all the food at all of these fancy dimsum places pretty much taste the same to me. It would only make sense that there's a crazy (or rather, eccentric) dimsum tycoon out there who has attained economies of scale and capitalized on our dimsum loving ways.

If you have been to Crown Princesses, you have pretty much been to Crown Prince. Differences: 
+ You got to stay in Scarborough. Pro: You didn't have to commute too far. Con: You have to fight other crazy driving Asians for parking. 
+ Less attentive service. Probably because you're in Scarborough.

Three stars. Until another dimsum restaurateur out there does something really crazy and creative, like serve innovative dimsum in a modern, upscale decor that isn't Victorian themed."}
{"text":"Literally over-the-top Chinese restaurant, with high ceiling, opulent chandelier, framed European paintings, Victorian-style chinaware, and servers in uniform roaming about efficiently (but without much warmth) in a fairly relaxed, spacious setting. The food is expensive if you belong in the middle class or below. I tried the dim sum during the morning happy hour (Before 11 am - S, M, L items @ 2.80 per), but the special is deceiving because more than half of the dishes listed is priced as XL or SP ($ 5 - 9). I found the food disappointingly under-seasoned, although the ingredients were certainly fresh and of high quality. I couldn't bring myself to pay $60-70 for a dim sum meal for two, but I guess for those with deeper pockets, there's more to a dining experience than just quality and value."}
{"text":"So I was just getting out of this diet clinic (trying to lose the last of that damn baby weight) and I was put in that kind of scenario where you walk out of Weight Watches rs and RIGHT NEXT STORE there is a donut store. Well my personal donut store is actually ANY dim sum restaurant. So we headed into Crown Prince, thinking that it seemed popular enough for such a large place. 

When you walk in you're a bit taken aback at the fact that this doesn't look like your typical Chinese dim sum place - it has this very cool/odd mix of french decor accompanied by all the servers dressed in quasi-french maid outfits. Think Japanese maid cafe's only not as short skirts (I know, WHY were we there then!?). They also serve their tea out of fancy teapots which I really enjoyed cause I'm a huge tea snob. I was actually really mad at another table across from us which seemed to have a nicer teapot. Jerks. 

The dim sum we were served was pretty tasty: har gow, shu mai, steamed pork buns, beef balls, spicy squid, shrimp noodles, and tendon.

Ask me how this came to $60. Ask me.

Seriously I have no clue.

I mean, it was good, but $60 good? I'm going to go with no. No it wasn't. And granted: serves us right for not actually looking at the Saturday morning prices but I blame the surroundings - they distract you with the fancy frilly dresses and then serve you $12 shu mai! (probably not actual cost of the shu mai)"}
{"text":"The place is great, the food amazing... But i think having a menu full of pictures would be REALLY HELPFUL for people who doesn't know Chinese"}
{"text":"This place is regularly my go-to dim sum restaurant in the Markham area. Although the service is lacking (similar to many other dim sum places), the food is great and the price is right. I would recommend that you come here on those early Sunday mornings!

1. Food (4/5)

The food is pretty great. They have a lot of selection from their menu. The price isn't bad either. If you go in the early morning (before 11am), all S, M, and L dishes are $3; whereas the XL dishes are at $6. Be sure to try the spring rolls and the short ribs, both of which are common things that regulars order. I also like the salt and pepper deep fried mushrooms that can be found in the secondary menu! (You can only get the mushrooms after 11am though)

2. Service (3.5/5)

Not the best service. Everyone is so busy that they often forget when  you ask for something like hot sauce. You might have to end up asking 2 - 4 times before you get what you want. Other than that, the food comes out relatively quick, so you got that going.

3. Wait (3.5/5)

The waits on weekends are what you would expect. If you want to go for early morning dim sum, you should be lining up at around 8:30AM, before they open at 9AM. By 9AM, if you are not in the early batch of customers, you may not get a seat. If you know that you will be late and not make it by 8:45AM at the latest, go around 10:30AM - 11AM, where most other people get seats. Note, you'll miss out on the early specials.

Overall (4/5)

The place is great overall. The interior looks classy and so is the china that they serve with. The food is good and they come out relatively quick. Although the service can be better, the restaurant is bis enough to accommodate large parties, which reduces wait times! Overall, I would recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Our regular dim sum place, 10 minutes' drive, spacious, consistent quality of food, good price, average service (servers are more attentive if you come in big group, give more tips, or during off-peak time like anywhere else ;)).
Wish they add more congee options and fried dough (youtiao), and some fried noddles/rice/vermicelli for big group to share (they offer some after 11am though)."}
{"text":"came here many times after we discovered it. I've learnt the trick - arrive around 930-10, you get a nice seat right away, relaxing while you order, fresh food appear on the table as you laugh at the starved suckers that are lining up. (no seriously i refuse to go and line up for an hour and half for dim sum on a weekend morning, this place is so buzy it's like.. not even humane) only problem is getting up in the morning on a sat is kind of tough.

amazing dim sum for a fabulous price! nope i don't own the restaurant or anything but you MUST come and try it!"}
{"text":"Sat upstairs in Heidi's section. She was amazing! Best service we've ever had for dim sum with two kids and 8 adults. Mashed pumpkin was the best part."}
{"text":"This is a brand new restuarant that has just opened in place of one that went out of business. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food because I can get a million times better at home. But, on occassion when having to deal with the elderly members we must go out for some good old fashion Chinese dinner. Wonderful.

I came to this place with my family, when I walked in I thought I was going into a music video for J.Lo. Everything about the decor of this place is gaudy. I didn't think Asian were capable of that but there it is. The decor would make any crown prince blush.

The colour scheme is dark purple and gold. There is a velvet purple chaise lounge just randomly in the corner, you know, in case you faint or feel the need to lie down. The chairs are covered in a velvet purple cover, table cloths are gold. There is a huge China flag that drapes over the main stage and HUGE pictures of Napoleon all along the walls. 

The table setting was very Westernized with double plate setting with a silver lining, matching tea cup and saucer, bowl, chopstick and spoon holder, and a teapot with gold embroidery. The pink napkins even had a silver napkin ring around it.

The plates that the food is brought in were different shapes and sizes and it was very awkward to place everything family style with them but the servers were experts and did a fine job. 

The food was really good. That is saying a lot since I never like the food I eat outside of my own house. The sweet and sour pork was crispy and tender and definitely did not have that rubbery fat that you find in a lot of them. The roasted pork was so good and the skin was the perfect crispness. The dishes weren't too greasy or salty. I would definitely come back to this place, even if the decor is a bit much, it's not too shabby for a Chinese place."}
{"text":"Came here with friends to satisfy my dim sum cravings. We came around 9:30am on a Saturday and it was already quite busy. This place is designed quite nicely with beautiful decor including the many chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. They also have covers on all the chairs. Its a very clean restaurant. There are several tables in the restaurant and quite big. Expect long lines if you come after 10 so come early to avoid waiting for a long time. You place your order on order sheet. Different dishes have different pricing for Small, Medium, Large and X-Large. If you come Monday- Sunday before 11am, all the Small, Medium and Large dishes are $3.30 each. We ordered about 15 dishes ranging from classic dishes such as Har How, Siu Mai, Shrimp Roll with Salad Dressing, Deep Fried Octopus Tentacles, Steamed Shrimp and Veggie Rice Roll and Mango Pudding and much more.  Most of the dishes came in a timely manner and was quite delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the portion size. I found the rice roll strange with the veggie inside. In my opinion, it tastes better with just the shrimp. For some reason, we never got the Siu Mai after placing in our very first order when we arrived. Service was average. Overall, a very nice place to come get your Dim Sum fix. Just make sure you are willing to spend a little more here and definitely come early to take advantage of their special pricing and to avoid huge lineups here.  Definitely a new hotspot and favorite place for me to go for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"One word:  fabulous! 

Attended a formal wedding reception in traditional Chinese banquet style here.  A twelve course formal dinner was fabulous in quality of food to feed our gargantuan party of three hundred fifty (350) guests. Service from Crown Prince's staff is somewhat slow as it was held in the mist of Toronto's G20 Summit where Downtown Toronto was plague by the violence and destruction of protesters, thus some waiter staff were unable to be present.  The dinning area's decor of Victorian red flocked wall paper with small heart-shape crystal chandeliers float above the center of the banquet room, near the stage.  Table place setting were elegantly arranged as napkins were folded in the Bishop's Mitre to complete our formal wedding banquet.

Upon opening dinner with the first course, the entrance of Crown Prince's wait staff was a single line with lighting dim as they all carried sparklers for the renowned first course Chinese braised roasted pig (Siu1 yuk6).  A relative commented the wait staff's grand entrance of a single line with sparklers emulates dinner on a cruise ship.  Crown Prince is upscale in decor which comes with attentive customer service and high quality of food.

CHINESE presence is worldwide, period!"}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about the Victorian decor but the ambiance is quite nice.  Definitely feel clean and roomy unlike most Chinese restaurants.  The service is quick and fast.  Really enjoyed my dim sum experience.  I like everything that we ordered, especially the pumpkin and corn congee.  The quality of the food is really good, and the early bird special price really makes the experience more satisfying.  It will be one of my favs when I come back for a visit next time."}
{"text":"Decent place for dim sum, especially they are one of the few places that still offer a morning dim sum special on weekends but honestly I wish the staff can put in a more normal system in place instead of allowing patrons to just run in like chickens who lost their heads once the doors are open. Patrons run in like the food is free to secure a table. what happened to bringing the patrons to their tables ?

Crown prince restaurant is huge. It has a second floor and also a separate dining area next to the main dining area. don't understand the fuss as to why they can't just all open up all the space in the morning so that we don't see this madness happening every morning. I got really stressed trying to secure a table one time when I got there at 845am and haven't tried to bring my out of town family to try this restaurant 

Parking is also very limited in this plaza"}
{"text":"Fantastic!

I go out to dim sum. A lot. This place has become my favourite place to go to when I'm up in the Scarborough area.

As mentioned in many of the reviews, the decor is much Victorian-European inspired and classy. 

The early bird special for $2.80/dish (S/M/L) before 11:00am allows customers a chance to try a \"higher-end\" Chinese restaurant without breaking the wallet. My experience here has been consistent, as with the attentive service.  

Notable dishes:
Sui Mai - It's huge! Though it's an XL ($5.80), it was well worth it.
Pumpkin Congee
Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chives

The parking lot is a pain. Especially after 10:00am when everyone is trying to get in for the early bird special. 

Overall: 
If you're a dim sum fan like me, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding so this review will be based off of that.

The establishment is beautifully decorated with what feels like Victorian style in a Chinese restaurant. Food was decent but served quite slow, however, there were approximately 300 guests. Food is plated for you at the table with each dish so its quite elegant and nice that you don't have to fight with others for food. Nice selection of alcohol. 

Other than that, I would like to come back to try their dim sum very soon."}
{"text":"Worse restaurant ever came here  with my family from china, just to get bitched at and treated like shit ? first they serve us cold dim sum, and one of the dishes were raw so I asked politely for an exchange the manager came and just took the dim sum without saying a single word even thou it was their fault for serving that crap and on top of that he has the balls to tell me and my whole family to stop complaining ???? Good luck with that kinda of service towards your customer and the dim sum was below average and over price garbage."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum restaurants I've been to in Toronto. The decor is like your typical chinese restaurant but they take it a level over top. 

All the food is made to order, so its fresh and tasty, the food is cheap if you share with a large number of people and this is only the cleaner places I've been too."}
{"text":"Their dimsum quality is mediocre and food is quite salty. Prices are on the upper end of typical Markham/Richmond Hill dimsum. The staff are quite rude and inattentive with things like refilling the teapot. While the restaurant tries to portray a fine dining atmosphere, maybe because of all the drapes and cloths, it can get quite stuffy and warm inside, even if you sit close to the entrance."}
{"text":"Second floor is terrible. Terrible service and waitress was rude, even carelessly took away dishes with the condiments spilled all over the table without any apologies. I suspect she is overworked as she is the only one taking care of the second floor."}
{"text":"If you go in with the expectations that this place will be BUSY on the weekends and you will have to wait then you will be fine.  Located in Scarborough this opulent Chinese restaurant with it's hot pink velvet chairs and huge sparkling chandeliers gives it that wow/tacky kind of vibe.  The parking lot is a disaster so save yourself trouble of circling around countless times and park on the street or next door (there is a sports rink and a church - just a few minutes walk over). 

Half price dim sum before (S, M, L orders) 11am is the reason it's crazy on the weekends.  We managed after waiting 45 min to squeeze in our orders at 10:58am.  The food came quickly and everything was hot and delicious.  The typical dim sum items - beef balls, har gow, sticky rice in lotus leaf etc.

The waitresses are dressed up to resemble french maids and the guys are all in black and white so you can easily spot your server.  

We were lucky enough to get a show while here as there was a what I assume some local organization that put on a dragon show that performed for about 40 minutes.  Being the week after Chinese New Year it was most likely for that reason but it made the whole experience much more fun."}
{"text":"Oh my little crown prince. Dim sum and then sum.  Whenever I'm in TO I gotta make a stop here to get my shark fin soup dumpling.  Great dim sum, just don't sit up stairs."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum place in GTA (the other one is Dragonboat fusion at Richmond Hill).

Order before 11on a weekday gets you an early bird special, where you can get large and medium for the prize of a small. 

There are some unique but delicious items that you dont see often in other dim sum places."}
{"text":"Great for early bird dim sum specials! The dim sum was on par with the other uptown places and they have some unique items. Would come back again during the specials but don't think it's worth the full price"}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me was the decorations of this place. There were chandeliers, fancy furniture, and paintings. This was noticeably better than other Chinese dim sum restaurants. The food quality was great, though a little more expensive than comparable places. The waitresses wore aprons and headdresses that were reminiscent of maid uniforms (but they were not all dressed anywhere near identically). The dining hall is huge, and it seems the place often gets rented out for large wedding parties."}
{"text":"This place banks itself on its 'upper class' ambiance.  Upon entry you are greeted with two lounge sofas.  Theres some wear on the leather.

There are large decorative art pieces, I'd associate it with renisance french art (I'm not an art expert) but think Napoleon era.  The food runners are dressed in french maid outfits, complete with head pieces if I remember correctly.  The tea pot and tea cups are strictly of the english sort, complete with handles.  I like this type of tea set because you get more tea, compared to the small miniscule cups you get elsewhere.

Chairs are draped in purple velvet, problem is the waitstaff don't bother dusting off crumbs and food before you sit down.

Note - If you plan on coming here in the winter time, try to avoid any seats in the front.  Even though there is a wall partition at the front, if you sit in the middle you will feel a draft.  

Onto the food.  If you have always wanted to try \"birds nest egg tarts\" or other exquisite sounding dishes with abalone, shark fin, then this is the place to go.  

Unfortunately, the food falls flat.  Even regular humble dishes like spare ribs and black bean and chicken feet were less than average.  I expect the spare ribs to be of the highest quality meat, minimal fat.  However, it was the tough pieces full of fat.

Chicken feet with abalone sauce, tasteless and again bad quality.

We ordered the birds nest egg tarts.  I've heard about these when watching Chinese soaps, only the wealthy and elite order these.  What we got was laughable.  We got four mini egg tarts, two with egg custard and two with milk custard.  I asked where the birds nest was and I was told the small thing on top was the birds nest.  Needless to say, my egg tart tasted like any other egg tart.  Couldn't even taste the difference from this to a regular egg tart at any dim sum restaurant.

What does french decor have anything to do with Chinese food?  I think it's all gimick but that's just me.

I noticed that the servers were quite friendly with what we guessed were regular customers.  If they don't know you here, don't expect top notch service.  Our tea pot was left open and the manager walked by several times, and several wait staff looked at it and never came by to refill it.  Empty dishes and plates were not cleared at all until the end of the meal when we had paid and they wanted us out.  Service was definitely indifferent.  We had to constantly wave down staff for anything.  I noticed people sitting around us were constantly being helped or served.

Staff here is three tiered, you have the managers that wear suits, don't expect them to really help you.  They seat you at your table and that's about it.  If you have any needs they tell you 'talk to a waiter'?

The waiters are the ones dressed in black.  They will take orders, and bring you anything you request.

Runners, all women and are all dressed up in french maid outfits.  They are probably the least paid and least appreciated by mgmt.  The most friendliest in this place compared to everyone else.

Food 2/5
Service 1/5
Ambiance 3/5

This place gets the 1 star for the lack of service.  I don't expect stellar service at a chinese restaurant, but when I am paying premium prices I expect decent service."}
{"text":"I came here for a wedding the decoration of the main floor was amazing. The chandlers and the color scheme of the entire floor was what made it the look nice.

As for the food the taste was pretty average compared to any other chinese resturant ive been to. The difference in this one is that instead the servers divide up the food ahead of time to everyone that at the table instead of the normal leave the dish in the middle and everyone will just pick at what they want. What was very negative about this is that on certain dishes they only gave the number of people that were at that amount no more no less. That caused a bigger problem because in our table we had one less person in the table to 10 and since the reception paid for each table a a while before hand meaning someone paid for one we didn't get so did the waiter eat it then...."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Played titanic and jazz music suitable for ginger shagging. Nice lighting, cheap looking decor but clean. Pumpkin congee came first. Service is good. Note one Canada goose jacket per table minimum. Food was good as expected. You are going to see more tentacles passing per minute than in a hentai pornography. If you have a French maid fetish, this is your spot. Enjoyed the early bird special."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dim sum places !  If u come before 11am there's special pricing but remember to come earlier if u want the special pricing as there will be a line up.  To avoid the line ups I usually go around 12pm.  Going later u will feel less pressure to hand over the table as there r other guests waiting.  The staff does not pressure u at all, I just don't like the feeling of making ppl wait myself.  Good quality.  Decent pricing.  Nice decor.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Come here before 11am, and all dishes S, M and L are all $2.70 (or $2.90? Can't remember lol). 

We came in on Saturday morning at 9:30am for a party of 5. Waited less than 30 minutes for a table. 

They have a lot of classic dim sum dishes and some with a twist. Food was alright, nothing to write home about. Service was only okay, but they are pretty busy during dim sum hours. Asked for water 4 times before we got some. 

Overall, you gotta come before 11am to make it worth your while, I could see how you could end up spending an arm and a leg for dim sum after 11am."}
{"text":"I use to go to New World millions of times when I was a kid.  It was *the* place that my dad would always want to go to because it was dirt-cheap dim sum.  Then we started to go to \"Sam Woo\" located at Warden and Steeles because the quality started to get bad at New World.  Later on, we found out that it closed down.  It was a sad day for North York.

Anyhow, recently, my parents suggested to go to \"Crown Prince\" -- I heard it was overpriced before, but apparently now, they changed the pricing.  If you go for early bird dim sum (and my parents and I ALWAYS do), it's only $2.80 for the dishes (S, M, L).

Make sure you go EARLY though.  My parents and I made it there 5 minutes after opening, and it was already packed like crazy.

I was shocked by the new decor in the restaurant.  It had the Victorian European look with chandeliers and all.  I guess I was so used to the tacky, typical Chinese restaurants that it was nice to see something different and new.

The menu was very different from the typical Chinese dim sum places.  There were a lot of special dishes.  However, my parents and I ordered the typical items: har gow, siu mai, chiu chow dumplings, etc.

However, two things that I really liked at the restaurant were the following:
1) PUMPKIN CONGEE: It's different, but I absolutely loved it.  But I might be biased because I love congee. 
2) ZONGZI:  (a.k.a. glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves): apparently it's the speciality that they have at this restaurant for dim sum.  I noticed that A LOT of people ordered it.

Great service, great decor, and great food at Crown Prince.  I'm only giving it 4 stars though because I'm not sure of how it is on non-dim sum hours."}
{"text":"Came here on weekday for early bird special. 
S/M/L items are all at $3.3 cash only. 
Much less ppl than weekends. 

The must try is baked mashed pumpkin. they are so yummy, I would say #1 in town ^^"}
{"text":"Dim Sum review
Be prepared to wait, this place is packed all the time for dim sum.  We drove by a few times after I ate here and at all times, even at 1 pm, it was packed!

The interior of this place is very British, all the way to teapots and cups. It's very clean overall and looks nice.  We were lucky and got seated upstairs in a small room with a few tables, but it was still fairly loud in there, downstairs it's a zoo.  

Sui Mai (Pork Dumping) - these things are big with perfect density.  The flavor is good
Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling) - wow 3 shrimp per dumpling!  These tasted great!  Good thickness to the skin
Beef Balls - Not bad, very typical tasting
Deep Fried Taro dumpling - these are lame, they lack flavor and crispy outside
Shrimp and Veggie Rice Roll - the veggie kinda takes away from the shrimp flavor, i've had better
Sirloin Steak Rice Roll - um yea normal chopped up beef is much better, this was too much chewing to get through it, i understand the try at being a better upper class dish but it's not that good
Rice Roll with Spring Roll inside - the spring roll was nice and crispy, i am quite impressed with this one

Service was ok.  Slightly better than typical chinese places.  They were nice over all."}
{"text":"I did have enjoyable dim sum in the past.

My review is for dinner 2 weeks ago- Don't go. Horrible service. I was horrified as I had 10 guests with me. 

Slow service. For a Chinese restaurant to patrons wait 15mins for 5 bowls of rice is really unacceptable. They forgot a tofu dish. they kept on trying to serve us by dividing the dishes up 12 but they were always short no matter which server did it. It was unbearable. We had to tell them to stop and we would serve ourselves.

NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum twice and feel like it's always a solid choice. Service is only passable but the tea set/chinas are adorable. It takes a long time to get your water refilled or get the bill. The dimsum itself is standard and comfort food. Never disappointed. 

Don't come before 11. It'll be cheaper but holy crap it's a warzone and be prepared to wait amongst a sea of crazy Asian people. 

Decor is probably more grand than other dim sum places as it is a banquet hall type venue.

The larger parking lot does get full during busy times so be prepared to look for parking!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to dim sum place in Scarborough area if I want higher end dim sum. I prefer this place over Casa Victoria (warden/Steeles). They have early bird specials before 11am. The decor inside is pretty nice considering it's a higher end dim sum. Looks better than Casa Deluz (McCowan- old ruby). Overall, the prices are reasonable and the quality of food is good for what it's worth. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is nice, BUT

don't even think about coming here on or around any Chinese holiday - the food will take forever to arrive and you'll get to enjoy a good 4 hour sit. 

We can here for dinner on a regular night and it was nice, but on Chinese New Year they literally ran out of food and just stopped serving people."}
{"text":"Got here at 9:30am on a Saturday. Packed and almost no parking. Had to take a number and waited almost an hour before getting a table. Looking at all the photos posted I was really excited because there are many items I liked. Sadly after seeing the actual menu I noticed that many items photoed are not even listed so I'm guessing the menu has changed over time. 

The items that we did order though were very good but a few dishes did fall below expectations. The octopus tentacles were not cooked enough so the flavour was lacking and didn't have that caramelized crispy outer layer. Another dish that failed was the purple rice wrap. It just didn't taste good. The dishes that did stand out for me as positives was the soy milk custard \"tofu fa\" and the \"ham sey gok\" ( I gots no idea what the last one is called in English).

Service was also good considering how busy they were. As for the price I believe its $2.90 for small, medium, large before 11am for the early bird special. 

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ambience and decor absolutely fantastic! Very non traditional style for dimsum restaurant with European Victorian design and mix of east and west chinawares.  Staff have neat uniform. Good food, but not cheap. If you have an out of town guest, this is the place to bring for dimsum to impresss.  Staff customer service so-so (not much customer service). Tea costs $3.90 each. Before 11 am Mon to Sun, all sizes at $2.80; probably worthwhile during special hours only."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner last night for my Sister's birthday. Definitely not as busy for dinner compared to Dim Sum hours, especially the pre 11-AM discount Dim Sum!

As such, the service is pretty good because they have a lot of staff to wait on only a few tables. 

Food was great, one of their proclaimed specials is a sweet roasted duck, but after eating it many times I'm realizing it's not that special. Portions are a little small though if you're a hungry person. Desserts are good too!"}
{"text":"Here every weekend with my my fiancé and mother in law... Probably the most decent dim sum around in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is getting harder and harder to reserve a table for dinner on weekends; a lot of people have caught on and started holding weddings, taking the whole restaurant. Nevertheless, the few times we got in the food was excellent, such as tonight.

Shark fin soup (wait, I thought they banned them in Toronto?!) was one of the better ones I've tasted, the fins were actually thick unlike some of the other restaurants. My other favourite dish was the Chinese style tenderloin, that sauce is sooooooo sweet!!!

They really promote healthiness though, so they do lack a lot of the usual seafood (AFAIR no calamari, crustaceans, anything with a shell...). However they do make it up by providing a variety of options such as tilapia, halibut, etc.

Now you wonder, why 4 stars? Two things: The free range chicken was healthy...TOO healthy. There was almost no meat in it; our table of 5 finished that dish in, wait for it...40 seconds. The second thing was how fast the food came; everything came at once. While this normally would be a good thing for lunch, the problem was we were still barely starting our appetizer when all our dishes came at once. Sure enough, when we got to our dishes they were lukewarm to cool. While still tasty, I kinda do wish there was a small break in between. I mean...we were in and out in an hour.

Overall, 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Crown Prince is a huge fancy banquet hall with really piss poor service.  But luckily, the food was good enough for me to ignore that.  Most of the traditional items were pretty standard.  Their S, M, and L menu items are all $2.80 before 11am every day of the week so it gets busy b/t 10-11.  They don't skimp on the shrimp with big plump ones in their har gow and har cheung.  Even the shu mai were topped w/ fresh shrimp w/ tails left on which was a first for me.  My two favorites were the pan-fried turnip cake and the deep-fried mayonnaise (listed as \"salad dressing\" on the menu) & shrimp.  But aside from the food, the servers here are pretty rude.  I know if I want water, I should be asking one of the dudes in the vests and not one of the food servers, but I got the harshest cold shoulder from one of those beezies."}
{"text":"My husband and I hosted our wedding at this place because of the beautiful interior design and the sweet captain who assisted me throughout planning our wedding. Her name is Wendy and she was sweet, very kind and helpful.

The agreement was 12% tip on top of taxes. (which we paid)

SERVICE: I felt awful and embarrassed from the feedback I received from our guests. 70% of my guests told me that they were treated with poor attitude or received bad service.

A guest of mine asked the server to remove the beer bottles from their table, the server responded: \"I only got two hands.\"

My aunt asked for a side dish of hot sauce and the server pointed at the hot sauce on the table and rudely responded: \"It's right there!\"

It was ridiculous enough that they treated my guest like crap. But to top it off, they THREW OUT some of my guest's wedding favors. Also, they took away the centerpieces that people won and put them aside. Therefore, people who won the centerpieces were confused and left without them because they were not able to locate them.

ALCOHOL:  We brought our own alcohol and the agreement was for the servers to serve wine to my guests. The servers did not go around serving the wine as often. When my guests ask for alcohol, they did not bring it out. We also brought champagne for toasting and absolutely ZERO had been serve. I ended up taking them all home.

If they saw a bottle of wine on the table, the removed it without asking guests.

FOOD: 2.7/5

Overall, I was very dissatisfied because of the poor service. Would I ever go back to host another party? NOPE!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall that you would drive by without a second thought you will find this glammed up gem. 

From the moment you walk in you know you are in some place special. Hard not to feel special as you are hit with marble and gold and crystal chandeliers right on entry. The servers wear period costumes and yeah this place is just that great. 

Dim sum here is a bit of an art form. I have seen piggy faced buns and at this most recent trip carrot shaped/coloured ones which tasted better than they looked. 

It is not the cheapest dim sum. In fact most would find it expensive. But it is worth it. I have attached some pictures. And I won't describe the dishes too much other than really they are some of the best I have tasted. 

Go there and enjoy the entire experience. Great food, great service, and a very special atmosphere."}

Pros:
Dim sum is well prepared

Cons:
Seating area is very tight
Super long wait times

I have always heard a lot about Crown Prince for dim sum.  Every time I pass by, there are tons of people waiting and I never bother to wait myself.  Now that I live basically 2 minutes away, I was willing to try my hand at this place.  

When it walk in, first thing you notice is the sea of people waiting.  This place is a mad house on the weekends. Expect up to an hour and more of wait time.  This is mainly the reason I won't come back to often here.  I don't believe there is anything worth waiting more than 30 minutes for let alone dim sum.  That's just my personal belief.  If I'm told I need to wait longer, I usually look for somewhere else.  I will wait more for the first time trying something as an exception.

While you're waiting, you will get a number on a small piece of paper and wait for your number to be called.  The person calling out the numbers is on a microphone.  The microphone however is the worst microphone in the entire world.  You literally have to be 3 feet from the microphone to hear over the overall noise of the place.  The person waits 5 seconds for someone to answer and then moves on to the next.  Can you imagine waiting for an hour only to miss you're spot because of a shoddy microphone?  Because of this, you have this crazy amount of people crowding at the front so they don't miss their number being called.  This needs to be done much better in my opinion.

This place really tries to cram as much tables as they can.  It's not the biggest place so you end up with tables very close to each other.  There's not too much space to move around here at all.  It's a little bit cramped when the place is full.

The dim sum here though is very well done and prepared.  They definitely have a different spin on preparing their dishes here.  I can see why there are people willing to brave the crowds and wait times to eat here.

Personally, I would only come here if I came right at opening at got a table pretty shortly after.  The dim sum is pretty good here.  It's just the experience could be so much better if you ask me.  It's up to you whether or not you want to wait for a while and brave the crowds."}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague to try authentic Chinese dim sum. The banquet hall where this restaurant is located is really beautiful and they host different types of private parties here. We ordered several different types of dim sum and they kept bringing them out, a few at a time. We ordered the following: steamed pork dumpling, shrimp roll, beef ribs, deep fried sticky dumpling with meat, BBQ pork rice roll, sweet egg yolk paste layer cake.  Everything was delicious: nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. For each new dish I was surprised by the flavours and texture of the food. I just wanted to keep ordering and try more. On top of the awesome food experience, the staff was friendly and efficient. 
I can't wait to go back to this place again and try more of the dim sum! I give this place 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"There was a crowd of people waiting for their number to get called up, and the waitress didn't bother even if their speaker is so quiet that no one can hear.
After being seated, we were missing a chair and we asked the waitress for one. She kept asking what kind of tea we want, and ignored all our request while showing attitude. As well we request one extra bowl for a baby at our table and they kept threatening us that we have to pay an extra fee for the baby's spot.
Won't come again because of such bad service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We got there around 10 am and waited about 30 minutes to be seated (very crowded while waiting and too cold to wait outside). The food came quickly and was good but nothing extraordinary. Their siu mai were big and the desert tasted great. The price was reasonable because we came before 11, but they charged more than other places for tea (and no senior tea discount). If I do return it will only be for early dim only since I saw the price after 11 is a lot more."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over a decade or so. The quality of the dim sum is great, but it is definitely twice as expensive than dim sum in Chinatown (Spadina and Dundas area)."}
{"text":"Elegant over the top interior. More European style than Chinese.. which doesn't scream dim sum to me. My fiance's family and I came here because my fiance complained about going to Paradise for dim sum twice on this trip already. My fiance's dad managed to get us a last minute reservation for dim sum brunch and they a table ready for us when we arrived. Another no cart pushing dim sum place. My fav included the bird's nest egg tarts, silken tofu, mango pudding and their HUGE shiu mai and ha gao. Their egg custard bun's custard was really eggy and saltier than my like. Other than that.. everything was extremely yummy.. a little pricy.. but worth the quality!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5  
Service:  1  
Most of the food were good, some were better, so definitely worth the three and half stars; however, the service was substandard by a wide margin. 90% of the staff don't pay attention to customer (be it the ones who need something, the ones whom they were serving, or even the ones trying to pay). We had to ask three different servers just to get take out box."}
{"text":"Visiting Crown Prince made me question who was their interior decorator. Was there a surplus of discount pink velvet during the construction of the restaurant? Is this what the interior of Playboy Mansion looks like? All joking aside, I have to admit, the inside is kind of impressive. It's definitely hands down the fanciest looking dim sum place I've been to. The English tea sets are a very nice touch. If Marie Antoinette demanded a dim sum restaurant be put inside Versailles, you can bet it'd look something like Crown Prince but a little less pink. 

I came here with family on a Saturday at 9:00. Prices were $2.80 per dish for the whole dim sum menu. I was surprised at the incredibly cheap prices as the restaurant interior screamed \"tacky 1%\". 

Standouts of the meal include the lamb, giant shrimp dumplings, fried taro and chicken flaky dumplings and lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice. The squid tentacles were good but were pan fried instead of my preferred deep fried. Then again, I prefer a lot of things deep fried. One dish I would definitely avoid next time is the curry baby octopus. They were not tender and were hard to eat unless provided with a fork and knife. The mango pudding I ordered at the end was kind of flavorless though the koi shapes it came in were cute.  

Service is alright though the waitress forgot/ didn't care to tell us that one dish we ordered was no longer available until we flagged her down asking for the bill. The line-ups here around 11:00 are insane! I think there was a bigger crowd at the door after 11:00 than there was before."}
{"text":"The good:

Excellent curry cuttlefish - perfectly steamed, not chewy, just right;
Vegetable steamed dumplings - perfect, and generously stuffed with a lot of good vegetables;
Bundle of steamed vegetables:  winter melon, mushroom and pumpkin, tied with a green onion - exquisite.  Winter melon was a perfect texture (crisp) and the bundle refreshing.


The not-so-perfect:
Cold choi sum.  Big disappointment. 
Steamed lamb - seasoned with the perfect amount of cumin and what may have been 5 spice.  But lots of fatty pieces and a couple of large water chestnuts which should have been lamb instead;

Service:  OK, given there was one lady attending to our area doing everything from setting the tables to taking order requests, payment, etc.

Very glitzy and glamorous.  Less gaudy than the downtown Crown Princess location."}
{"text":"The food is good.  We had a good time until the server was so rude. I put my money in the tray and closed it.  She opened it and dumped all the money on the table and said \"what no tip?\" She kept saying it over and over again. I said I gave you 20% and she said oh. What was the point of dumping the money on the table if you weren't going to count it.  I should have taken my tip back. Terrible service will never come back or bring friends here. My friends were here for the first time and this was their experience. It was so embarrassing."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for dinner & dim sum. The service is quick & staff are nice esp. when we come w/ regular diners. 

We had a Chinese New Year dinner here for 22 ppl + & got a private room upstairs. 

Loved the baked spicy curry shell dish, it was amazing!! The scallops (fried & cooked the traditional way) was also very delicious. I thought the lobster could have had more seasoning but otherwise it was ok, liked the fried oysters also! Thought the duck was a bit fat & kept having to take the layers of fat off. 

Dim sum was also a very nice experience. The food was yummy! They were fast & the price was decent before 11am. 

I used to like the decor here as it was in purple and gold. Now I feel it's a tad tacky w/ the traditional Chinese colours red & gold hues. I believe they can fit 20-ish tables here for a Chinese wedding banquet."}
{"text":"Like everywhere else, they have their good times and bad moments. I have had the majority of my experience here in the super positive area. The only problems I have ever encountered is the wait times. But that it happens no matter where you go for Dim Sum.

Now about this place. Service is great and patience is not mandatory but useful. If an unhappy moment happen, they will look after it. Like right now, we're waiting for one more item. We asked and there was an unexpected delay making it.

Going about the day afterwards with good vibes.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Use to be decent, quality has gone down recently.  What is suppose to be shrimp taste more like preserved dried shrimp.  Portions are super small so even special time dim sum isn't such a good deal anymore.  Place is packed though, so maybe that's why quality became more of an option."}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum place. It gets super busy on weekends, so make sure to get reservations ahead of time. The layout of the place is quite spacious for dim sum restaurant standards and the high ceilings also means you can actually have a conversation with the people across from you. 

They stop serving dim sum around 3:30 to prepare for their dinner service, so you should plan accordingly. 

They have all the standard dim sum dishes. Make sure to order the BBQ pork pastry, Maggie short ribs, the egg tarts, and the gooey custard buns!"}
{"text":"DECOR IS EVERYTHING.
I have been to this location for dimsum many times over the years and watched it change from owner to owner. I remembered the hideous giant chandeliers and bland cream white colour concept from ages back. I came back after hearing about all the renovations they have done and was really surprised. 
I thought it would have been tacky, but it was actually quite tasteful for the most part. They kept up the theme to their utensils as well. My grandma who is an OG dimsum foodie, said the food was good, not excellent but still good. However, the atmosphere of the place seemed to please her. 

The food.
I didn't try too much since i came with just my sister and grandma, but the desserts were definitely the highlight. 
The sticky rice and chicken feet were quite good too.

I thought the food was slightly pricey since we didn't come at the \"special hour\" but I wasn't too bothered by their $$$"}
{"text":"It was my first time going here and was impressed by the decoration(made me feel like I was eating in a palace). Fancy gold all around the restaurant and red carpet. 
My family and I came here at 1 pm. the lineup wasn't that long but we ended up waiting for 10 mins - which was fine for us. 

The food came in a decent time after ordering. Food quality is good. We ordered har gow and siu mei. The meat and shrimp tasted fresh. But best of all, they put a lot of shrimp in my har gow (very generous). My new love is the durian pastry!!!!!!! It's sooooo goood. Very flaky on the outside with creamy durian in the inside. Highly recommend it!

Cons: not sure if it's because we were seated at the middle of the stage where all the lights are at, but we were sweating while eating. I thought I was dining in a sauna room. 
Service is meh. Our waitress was slow and inattentive. we asked her a few times for an ice water (to cool ourselves) but took her forever to bring it. 

Overall I'd say the food quality is 4* while the service is 3*."}
{"text":"If you are going to line up anyways (which you should be prepared to do for the 11AM dim sum special), then you might as well wake up a little early and do so at 9AM for the restaurant opening. That way you can be the first batch in and avoid being one of those who peek through the decorative screen at other people's Siu Mai, 'cause that just makes everyone uncomfortable. But I know, easier said than done. :P

Overall the food quality is very high. Shrimp dumplings had lots of fresh shrimps, soft tofu dessert melts right in your mouth and is delightfully tofu-y, and the beef tripe had just the right degree of chewiness. My highlight was the pumpkin shaped pastry, not too sweet, sticky and warm on the inside, plus they look so cute!

The service was only so-so. I don't think they have the best dim sum order taking system down, what with not being able to mark things down freely after the initial order and having different staff responsible for order taking and food delivery, but whatever, we cope. Wasn't so nice when the order taking lady gets called over by her colleague and barked at us 'what did you order that second time? what are you trying to tell me?'... maybe let us talk first? 

I also find it slightly awkward that some of their dishes have three-people portions, isn't usually four the ideal number? But I guess for big groups this is less of an issue since you end up ordering multiple helpings anyways...

In all a good experience. I wouldn't mind coming again for sure, or I might try some of the other fancier dim sum places, then again my heart has a special place for those traditional dim sum carts pushed by smiley and sometimes pushy Cantonese ladies. Call me old-fashioned."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.  So many options and everything was super tasty.  They also have discounts if you order before 11am daily.  Lines were out the door on a Thursday morning, so come early if you want to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"Been here many times like the food that comes all at once would recommend this place to anyone prices are ok"}
{"text":"Asian people need to think of better names. It either has to do something with a classy adjective (imperial/royal), colour (red), mystical animal (dragon), or a rock (jade). I mean if you're gonna use the SAME OLD words atleast jazz it up like ..

Yum Yum Sexy Unicorn .... y'know? I'd totally go in if I saw unicorn as the business name.. Or not. 

ANYWAY, if you've been to Crown Princess, this is opened by the same owner so the decor is over-the-top 'Royal' and fit for a king. However there is no red here but complimentary colours of purple and gold.

The food is pretty good. Above average, but not in my favorites. Their BBQ puff pastry isn't very flavourful, but the crust is nice and flaky. Their sticky rice was presented in a pyramid shaped which was unique and had lots of ingredients. Also their BBQ flour rolls have too much flour and not enough filling bbq pork and spinach.

Oh yeah, the service is great btw. Very attentive as to when the teapot is empty.

Overall: I go dim sum a lot and this place is only okay."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy dim sum comparable to what I can find in SF, but the price before 11 am makes it even better. :)"}
{"text":"Found a new favourite dim sum place! The banquet looks nice-decor is so fancy with huge chandeliers everywhere and the servers wear old fashion maid dresses. When we went at around 10:30am, it was packed and was hard to get the attention of staff. Other than that, everything else was good.  

Every dish I ordered was really delicious, especially the steamed pork dumpling (siu mai). Even though siu mai is mostly standard everywhere, this place made it an amazing texture (it wasn't too soft or hard) and it was stuffed with just the right amount of ingredients. They also offered some unique dishes that I've never seen before, such as pumpkin pancake and pumpkin and corn congee (if you want the deep fried stick that usually comes with congee you have to ask for it as they will not give it to you with the congee and it's not on the menu). For dessert I would definitely recommend trying the milk egg tart with bird's nest-it was the perfect sweetness. 

Like most other dim sum restaurants, come before 11am to avoid the rush and take advantage of their special! All sizes dishes (except XL), are $3.30."}
{"text":"If you order Dim Sum before 11AM, everything L & XL is $3.50. I usually come here Atleast once whenever I visit Toronto. But man, these Chinese wait staff was so rude. I never expect great customer service from any \"authentic \" restaurant, but be warned... they are really rude. Dim sum was good though. I guess it makes up for it????"}
{"text":"I didn't get a look at the final bill so i can't tell you if the food is worth the price, but what i can tell you is that the food here is very good but not memorable. The dimsum they serve was fresh and tasty, but nothing really struck me as being so good i want to come back for more. The decor is very flashy and a great place for family gatherings. If someone asked me where i want to go to for dimsum, this wouldnt be on the top of my list though."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm my friends and I went for breakfast and it was amazing!!!! Can't wait to go back. 
AMAZING DIMSUM!!!! Loved the fried pumpkin balls mmmm. 
Atmosphere is absolutely beautiful"}
{"text":"The quality of food and service has definitely declined as prices crept up.   The dim sum order took over an hour to show up.  They appear understaffed for most roles.  There are better offerings in the area to try and visit."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp. We were visiting Toronto and we wanted to have some dim sum. As soon as we walked in we were very impressed about the look of the restaurant. We decided to order a few plates and the plates came pretty quickly. The servings are a bit smaller, but I would say that they were quite delicious. I would recommend going here for dim sum with friends or family and I would come here again on my next visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

After having a great experience at Crown Princess Fine Dining (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/crown-princess-fine-dining-toronto#hrid:gj4vgAMbe7tv97-QKvUatA/src:self), I decide to give the sister restaurant Crown Prince Fine Dining a try. 

The good thing about coming here is that it is in Scarborough and have free parkings and it is in my hood. They too offer that Early Bird Specials $2.80 for (S/M/L) if you place your order before 11 AM. 

When comparing to Princess VS Prince: 

- Better Services the staffs are much efficient, polite at the Prince Attentiveness: Princess is much better, the reasons is there are so many managers working on the floor to ensure good services 
- Food presentation : Princess dim sum is a lot better presented. 
- Taste wise: they are around the same 

Crown Prince I guess since it is located in Scarborough... it becomes just another Chinese restaurants. The customers are mainly Chinese in the area.. ok maybe we are used to more crappy services. 

Crown Princess down at Bay/Charles near Yorkville attracts more non Chinese, Businessmen in the area... they do really step up for their services. 

If I really want to impress my out of town friends, I am going to drive all the way to downtown to Crown Princess instead of coming here!

We came on a Thursday morning and it is a full house, can't imagine how it is on the weekend!

BTW, I will never never come here if it is NOT an early bird specials!

* Durian Puff Pastry is the BEST I have yet! It is so Stinky Smelly!! Creamy in texture and just taste like eating the Real thing!"}
{"text":"This place amuses me a lot (in a good way!)...It's basically upscale dim sum in a Juicy Couture/Barbie store. The food is delicious, but what makes it really stand out is the decor. They have a room with VELVET walls and ornate purple/pink plush chairs with silver accents all around the restaurant. The waiters outfit is pretty cool, too. It's like some crazy mixture of Japanese gothic french maid/butler ruffly shirts and the like. Also, the dinnerware is a distinct faux European style. You wouldn't think it was a Chinese restaurant if it wasn't for the chopsticks and the food. It's really cool and definitely worth a visit for dim sum!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for Chinese food. I went there for dim sum. It is better than most places I went in NYC and San Francisco. Probably it is one of the best places for fine dining dim sum in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was there for dim sum.

The first thing that strikes me about this restaurant was it's over-the-top decor. It was like Las Vegas exploded everywhere. The place was dripping in marble, gold, chandeliers, velvet, Rococo oil paintings, and other over-the-top ornamentation. Yes, it's gaudy but I actually think it's almost funny, but most of the customers there seem to like it.

I was there 12:45 on a Sunday and there was a bit of a wait for a table.
The place setting at the table was nicer than your typical dim sum restaurant, with traditional English-style tea settings.
They had a really excellent dim sum menu and the ingredients, cooking and presentation are high in quality and very tasty. I liked every dish I ordered.

The food came impressively fast. Here are some highlights:

Shark fin soup dumpling:
This is in Scarborough, so no ban in effect here. I didn't want to have this but my mother insisted on ordering this for the entire table. If I could eat foie gras, I'd guess I could be un-PC this one time. It was impressively served in a personal-sized gold soup terrine with a large puff pastry lid.

New Style Spring Roll:
At first it looks any other spring roll but nicely arranged and presented on the plate, but biting into it you can taste the fresh ingredients and the care that was put into the dish.

Eggplant stuffed with shrimp cake:
There were 6 slices of eggplant sandwiched in between two layers of shrimp paste and lightly fried with a panko breading. It was very light, and had a very pleasant fluffy texture, not at all oily.

Beef tripe steamed with ginger and green onion:
Very simple but great flavour, freshness and texture.

Pan fried chive and pork dumplings:
I was expecting a gyoza or pot sticker dumpling but these were large with lots of stuffing with a delicately thin dumpling skin and complimented with a red vinegar dipping sauce. The great flavours just explodes in your mouth.

I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"For a \"high end\" restaurant the food didn't show it.  It was highly recommended by a friend because this place uses fresh green tea leaves.  Certain dim sum items were yummy but overall I didn't care for the food."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. After we paid for our bill, two servers came back to tell us that we didn't tip enough and wanted more money!!! Tipping is a choice that restaurant patrons make based on their experience and service level received at the restaurant. 

Servers do not have a right to ask for more money. This is embarrassing for an establishment that considers themselves \"fine dining\". 

I have never seen anything like this in my life. I will never go here ever again."}
{"text":"The inside here is top notch with chandeliers, expensive looking paintings, and very nice washrooms. The servers are even dressed up in french maid type clothing. As such, the dim sum costs a bit more than other places, but it's still very reasonable. 

The food here was generally good, and I don't think there was anything we ordered that I would say was \"bad\". By far THE dish to get here is the pan fried beef ribs with maggie sauce, which was just delicious. The sweet yolk egg paste layer cake was also very good. The har gow was also pretty good was well sized and filled with shrimp and no shells (my pet peeve). The siu mai was only okay surprisingly since it's a dim sum staple, same with the steamed bean curd roll, and the lotus leaf sticky rice.

Overall, this is a good place to have good, clean dim sum experience."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful with a very old school, Victorian feel. Lots of velvet, lots of huge chandeliers and lots of tall back chairs. 

The food to me, was just okay. Typical dishes of a typical dim sum restaurant. We went during the day on the weekend and had to wait about an hour. All the food is ordered off the menu so there are no carts for you to order off of. You also don't really have a designated waiter/server. You kind of just had to flag someone down to ask for anything, from food to refills to utensils. 

The service overall wasn't the greatest either. Everyone was very hasty and looked unhappy or stressed out. Personally, I've had better food with better service elsewhere. This place makes a good photo but that's about it."}
{"text":"The day after my birthday, I was craving for good dim sum, so I dragged my mom to Crown Prince for the early bird special before 11 am. Let me just say, people certainly go crazy for early bird dim sum! We arrived at 10:30 and had to wait 10 tables! Luckily, we were seated at 10:50 am, with 10 minutes to spare! 

I ordered a mixture of old favourites and new items to try!

Baked eel puff pastry- mashed taro filling and eel encased by crispy goodness! The piece of eel in each puff pastry is actually pretty small, but the taro filling is awesome enough to make up for that. 

Pan fried pork and veggie dumpling was well-stuffed but not very juicy. Not my favourite type of dumpling, but the flavour combination is delicious nevertheless.

Steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow). My mom and I didn't feel for har gow that day so I just took this all to my boyfriend who loves them. He reported that they were very good. 

Milk egg tart with bird's nest- the only SP item that I ordered. And it was totally not worth it. The crust was not crispy at all, and I couldn't taste the difference between the yellow and white egg tarts. I should've just gone to a Chinese bakery on my way home and picked up some egg tarts.  

Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf: one of my favourites of the meal! I love, love, love the combination of fatty pork and cured egg yolk inside the morsel of fragrant glutinous rice!!

Steamed shrimp and veggie noodle roll was tasty as well. The translucent rice noodle roll was velvety smooth, and the shrimps were plump and juicy. One small complaint is that a couple pieces of shrimp were nearly falling out of the rice noodle roll, making it difficult to pick up.  

Sweet egg yolk paste layer cake: my favourite dim sum dessert fresh off the steamers! I can't get enough of it! I just love the savoury touch from the cured egg yolk, which teases out the sweetness of the paste. 

All in all, it was an amazing feast! Other than the expensive egg tarts, I'd order everything else again. Dim sum here never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. The food didnot come after we ordered 40 minutes. When we asked them , they replied very rude and hostile . Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Don't let the nondescript exterior and gaudy decor turn you off, this place definitely serves up some delicious dimsum. I've only been here on weekdays so getting a table has never been an issue. We ordered eleven dishes for four people and I enjoyed everything, but I especially liked the steamed brisket in house stock (SO GOOD), baby octopus in curry sauce, and rice noodle stuffed with spring roll. Siu mai and har gow were both yummy too and really big! 

Come before 11am if you can -- most of the dishes are $2.90. The early bird deal is cash only though."}
{"text":"We attended my husband's cousin's wedding here. Absolutely gorgeous! Although it is a Chinese banquet hall, it has an European ambiance and flair. We had an amazing time and danced and drink our hearts out. The staff were very friendly and helpful particularly when we dropped our camera. It turned into a scavenger hunt at the end of the reception. Luckily, we were saved by them recovering it! We had a 10 course traditional Chinese reception, portions were extremely generous and fulfilling. It even included a Venetian desert bar at the end. And their full open bar kept the guests happy all night. Everyone had an incredible time."}
{"text":"Very expensive prices. The decor is a little too over the top. Its like a marble palace, there is marble everywhere. The food is average. But the decor is something to see...."}
{"text":"Today I had practically a smorgasbord of dishes, not my norm when there are a few of us so the price ended up quite high. $94 for 3 people.

However, it did allow me to try out a variety.  The service wasn't as good as I had the last time I was there so quite disappointed at that (so much so I knocked down one star because of it)

Their siu mai is still the best among any other dim sum restaurants and has a piece of shrimp stuck on it.  Make sure you remember to take out the toothpick.  The pork they used is quite excellent too.

I also had their eel stuffed taro.  However, it wasn't as good as I remembered either.  I barely tasted the eel.

Their ham-sui-kok is good, but I would say it isn't as good as the one at Century Palace.

Their har-gaw is run of the mill for me so quite disappointing.

They had some roasted pig belly that was offered and that one tasted awesome for me.  It wasn't too salty, oily is to be expected but it wasn't too overpowering.

Overall the restaurant sort of lost in terms of service and the food quality does not match the price this time around."}
{"text":"Some other Yelpers have written that the décor here is 'classy', but I'm afraid that I don't entirely agree. In fact, I don't agree at all.

I can probably best describe the furnishings in this restaurant as a cross between what I imagine the Playboy mansion looks like and the movie set for a low-budget film set in a French chateau. There is worn-down purple velvet everywhere, which attracts enough food crumbs to feed a family of four.

The food is middling, and definitely on the pricey side for a Chinese meal. The bill for four came out to about $100, and we only ordered four dishes! Service was prompt but emotionless; we got the distinct impression that both the chefs and hosts were preoccupied by the wedding occurring downstairs.

At $2.80 a dish for dim sum, this place might be a better bet, but as I'm in no hurry to ever return here, I suppose I'll never know."}
{"text":"The dim sum here was very good.   I was surprised at the dining set.    The teapot and plates were pretty fancy for a Chinese restaurant.    The decore makes you feel like you're in a fairytale castle.   The waiters and waitress wear these cute outfits.   They probably hate the uniforms but I think it adds to the experience.   I would go here.  It certainly is an experience.     This is the fanciest dim sum restaurant I have ever been in and I'm from Vancouver.   Even the bathrooms were updated and very clean.   I actually admire the tiling they chose for the mens room.    Good job!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum here I come!!!! Oh my, this was quite an experience it reminded me of Hong Kong's dim sum.  The place is huge!! It has a second floor, which is much smaller area and more intimate.  Nothing to be intimate about dim sum places, just look at the first floor, it looks like a swarm of people that have been chaotically organized - it's loud and noisy.  Typical chinese place.

I have one dish favorite: Crispy Chicken Gristle with Salt & Pepper!! Who would have known that they would do chicken ankles as a dish!!! Incredibly gummy and tasty, it was much fun eating them... yum yum!!!
Also had the Siu Mai, Har Gow which were wonderful as well!!  For dessert we had the sweet almond pancake, it was different, I would order it again.  Definitely a place to go with more than 3 people, if not you will not be able to try much stuff!!  We also had noodles cantonese style, it was a treat!

The place looks formal looking, very clean place, and staff is very very friendly.  Before 11am, they have all dim sum dishes at $2.80, it's quite a special!! what are you waiting for? just GO!!!!"}
