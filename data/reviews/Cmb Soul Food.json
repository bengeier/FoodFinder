{"text":"I've been here a few time now, and have enjoyed the food very much, I like the yams here I order them when they are available.  The wings were very yummy, well seasoned and fried. the fries can be a bit soggy from time to time, if that's a deal breaker for you."}
{"text":"In town for a business trip and had a craving for soul food sides. You know, greens and macaroni-n-cheese. Decided to look up restaurants via yelp and discovered CMB Soul Food... traveled nearly 30 mins, all to be disappointed. Smh! Unprofessional looking employees, children were in the kitchen, the back door was WIDE open, enough for flies and rodents to come inside. AND they were out of all the fish options that were listed on their posted menu. This kinda pissed me off... don't know why I continued to purchase my mac n cheese/greens. Smh   My MAC-n-cheese was dry and didn't taste like any seasoning was added!!!   My greens were cold and tasted old.  So needless to say, I definitely wouldn't recommend this hole in the wall to anyone. It's not worth the drive, nor the money."}
{"text":"Very good steak & cheese potato. I must admit a bit pricy but O soo good & the wings were fresh & hot & had a really nice flavor from the seasoning. I also appreciate that they cook your food to order no headlamps, so be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes but  worth it. I look forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"I have only been here to eat a few times, I think for the price the food is great! I order the loaded chicken potato and it is delicious! Of course just like every other hole in the wall in Cleveland there is no where to sit down. But all in all I like it a lot."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the process of getting it was problematic. Anything but an online order or cash payment seems problematic.  waited 10 minutes because of issues with their credit card machine before we could even talk with anyone.  It is a take out place, so I was not expecting a fancy decor, but they could spring for some paint and brighter lighting.  The inside and outside do not match.   I will never order lunch from there again, but I may give the food another try."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that the food is utterly delicious. We ordered three loaded baked potatoes: chicken, shrimp and steak and shrimp.  The meat was cooked well, the chicken done but tender, the steak flavorful but no pink, and the shrimp was cooked just right.  It is best to order ahead.  I was told the wait was 15-20 minutes, but it turned out to be 30 minutes, not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice to be told an appropriate wait time, then I would have just left and returned to pick up the food in half an hour.  Initially, I was taken aback by the pricing, the three potatoes set me back $38.50.  Chicken was $10.50, Steak and Shrimp was $13.50 and Shrimp was $14.50.  After getting the food home, I realized that the portions were hefty and could serve two people with a light appetite, or feed one person and have a leftover snack.    This is strictly carryout, no tables or inviting ambience, just good food.  I will visit again, and I look forward to trying some of their more traditional soul food fare.  All in all, the great food was worth the wait."}
