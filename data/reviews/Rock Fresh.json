{"text":"We had a great experience! We went in and were seated immediately, and got our drinks fast. The French onion soup was great along with the garden salad. We got the cheeseburger and open faced roast beef. The burger was juicy and seasoned well. The roast beef was cooked well, a little pink, as it's supposed to be. Some of the bread got a little soggy but a small price to pay for good gravy. The mashed potatoes were obviously from scratch, a little lumpy and really good. We got the brownie for dessert and it was fantastic!   Our waiter was very attentive and Rockne was in the back singing while he made our food. He actually has a great voice! :) Rockne also came out to greet us and ask about our experience after we were done.   Everyone that was there eating seemed happy with their meals, as we were. There were 5 other tables and 2 carry out orders while we were there. We will definitely go back again. If we have a bad experience, I will make sure to come back and add a second review. They are worth theming again, if you weren't satisfied before. And we paid cash, so I'm not sure if they take credit, but I believe they do."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited yesterday for lunch.  We ordered barley salad , chicken soup,  Hungarian sausage,  and Rachael sandwich.  We enjoyed the barley salad.  The soup was tepid and loaded with cabbage.  My husband's Sausage Dinner was inedible. The cabbage/noodles were apparently cooked for days ...homemade sausage was dry, mealy and underseasoned. Potatoes were inconsistent. At that point,  we cut our losses, paid $22 plus tip and left. There was no offer to adjust the bill. 2 more points: restaurant was messy,  ladies room filthy.  Save yourselves."}
{"text":"Used the Groupon ($20 for over $40 worth of food) and had a great meal with my wife.  We each got a salad, entree, and dessert.  There was only one person working (we came in between normal meal times), so he played the role of host, server, and cook.  He did a great job - no complaints."}
{"text":"Great food!  If it isn't on the menu, it doesn't exist!  You won't be disappointed. Good food and great place to meet friends!"}
{"text":"I just drove by and I see a sign that states they now accept Visa/MC."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened on State Road in a space that had housed a cafe that closed a few years ago.  The decor is warm and welcoming.  It was quiet when we were there, and we had no problem finding a table.  I had the Rock's Special Melt with chips, and my wife had the Portobello Delight sandwich with the cold barley side salad.  The food tasted great and was prepared quickly.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Be aware that they don't accept credit cards, so be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Groupon Review... $20 paid for a $50 meal  $6 for 2 drinks and tax...   There are credit card stickers next to the door... so not sure about the cash only comments in some reviews... we brought and paid cash just to be safe  Yes, the yound staff does nothing but talk to each other... very loudly... our waitress was more attentive than mentioned in other reviews... but that really didn't help the salt and mush and bizarre food.  They are only open for dinner 2 nights a week... ignore what their website says... Friday and Saturday are your only hope of redeeming the Groupon.  Groupon was for a 3 course meal for 2... salad or soup, entree, and desserts... here is how it went... (spoiler alert... not well)  French Onion Soup - wonderful... not too salty... plenty of cheese... real winner  Salad - room temperature lettuce, pear was chilled but still had seeds in it, walnuts were whole halves and not very practical, pretty sure blue cheese was listed on the menu... went to look online... it's not the same menu as in the restaurant.  So hubby loved his... I was afraid of my warm greens.  pork schnitzel, single potato pancake, green beans,and fluffy whole wheat bread - great bread, mashed potato pattie had nothing to do with the phrase \"potato pancake\" except maybe the sour cream served next to it, and the pork was rather tough to cut with the butter knife provided.  Open faced Roast Beef - mashed potatoes and gravy were nice... not too salty... but the roast beef itself was a total salt lick... and the bread underneath was the same light and fluffy variety that came on the side with hubby's pork... it turned into total mush.  So... neither of us liked either entree... but the pork was edible.  Chocolate Walnut \"cake\" Pineapple Upside down \"cake\"  At least the chocolate had the texture of cake... both were microwaved... in a cup... filled with sauce... and both the walnuts and the pineapple chunks were blistering hot... dead give away for a mivrowave.  The pineappe was gooey dough... no where near the texture of a quick bread... or a cake... and it tasted like raw flour... totally disgusting.  So resist the urge to get a bargain to try them out... honestly... the few bright spots were lost in the soggy mess of the rest."}
{"text":"I was confused when I walked in- wasn't sure if I supposed to walk to the counter & order or wait to be seated.  I kinda stood there with my kids for a few minutes & was kinda annoyed.  Finally, we started toward the counter to see how to order. We were then greated by a hostess or waitress, not sure.    We ordered water, which took about 5 minutes.  At that point, we were wanting to leave. I just wasn't feeling the love right away & they weren't very busy.  When it was time to order, we were told that they were out of reubens!  My daughter was wanting a reuben and, I could tell, she was dissapointed.  She had her heart set on one & really couldn't find a substitute. I told the waitress that we would pass and decided to leave.  She said she didn't blame us!    I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"This place has a great heritage, it's owned by the guy who started the Rockne's franchise, which I hold in rather high regard, so we had fairly lofty expectations for an everyday kinda restaurant.   The expectations crashed and burned starting from the moment we were seated.  It was a weekday, during the lunch hour, and we were the ONLY patrons. We remained the only patrons during the entirety of our visit.  We were soon to learn why!  For some totally unknown reason, there is a dining oxymoron that seems to apply universally, service is supplied in an inverse relationship to the number of patrons.  True to form, the waitress/hostess thought it was much more important to discuss whatever with the cook than it was to inquire if we would like a drink.  When she was done engaging in that segment of the conversation she ambled over and asked what we would like to drink. We both got iced tea.  After it was served the conversation was engaged in again, (this cook must be a BRILLIANT conversationalist, or more likely a GREAT listener!) When the conversation lulled a bit, our order was taken.  When my tea was empty, it was during the revival of the conversation with the cook, and mind you no occasional quick glance to see if we required some service was EVER afforded during these conversations. When my patience exceeded it's progressively diminishing fuse, I walked up to the station and poured my own refill. It happened at the same time as our meals were coming out. The lady got stuffed peppers with mashed potatoes and green beans. I got the roast pork with sauerkraut, a potato pancake, (errantly listed in the plural), and green beans. Let me preface my comments about the lady's meal with the statement that EVERY recipe I have seen  for stuffed peppers and EVERY time I have been served stuffed green peppers, they arrive in a seasoned tomato sauce, and rice is mixed with the ground beef, and usually the peppers are whole and seeded and stuffed with the beef mixture, and the peppers are cooked until soft. None of these things is true of the ones served at Rock Fresh. There is NO sauce, and NO rice and NO seasoning with the ground beef.  The peppers are roughly cut up and partially cooked, slightly beyond the state in which they would appear if they had just been blanched. There was a smidgen of a runny red gravy on the mashed potatoes, but absolutely nothing on the remainder of the dish. There was a bit of effort expended in the green beans, with onions and something  that was red, but not quite ham and not quite dried tomatoes and definitely not red pepper,  No idea what it was.  Rose petals from a bouquet that was shedding???They desperately needed salt, but were ok beyond that. The pepper dish was just crap.  It was almost like someone who had never before cooked and had never before eaten stuffed green peppers was instructed to make them, and this was the result. My meal was actually fine. Granted it's a tough one to screw up, but it was fine. Both meals were served with a huge piece of dense white bread that just didn't seem like standard commercial bakery fare, although it had to have been, and one very tiny butter packette, which, when deployed to a 3 micron thickness, covered about half of the piece of bread. When the lady said she could use more, it was obvious when a glance was made towards the waitress, whose back was turned to us, and who was fervently engaged in conversation, that there would be no forthcoming inquiry as to any needs we might have, I just loudly called the waitress and when her attention was secured, asked for more butter, which we got. When she brought it, she asked how our meals were, I said mine was fine, but that I had tasted the lady's and I didn't think it merited being served. She however, backpedaled a bit and said that when she poured (a couple teaspoons) of salt on it it was fine.  (Interpretation,,, it meant with the salt she could choke it down.) When the next round of conversation waned between cook and waitress, she brought our bill. Rather than wait for the next lull in her next conversation for her to retrieve payment,  I quickly pulled out my credit card and slapped it on the tray. \"I'm sorry, we don't take credit cards!\" What? Freakin' McDonald's takes credit cards! \"Yeah we're supposed to get one but the machine hasn't come yet!\" Bullshit! This place opened up in 2011, if they were going to take credit cards, they would have found the time to hunt down a vendor that would supply a machine in the interceding two years! Based on the absolutely aggravating service I can't imagine why I would want to return to this restaurant, It is a poster-child for why absentee management doesn't work! My advice to Mr. Becker is to immediately fire the daytime waitress/hostess and install surveillance cameras, so if he's gonna be off-site, he can use them to assess the performance of the help. Otherwise, if they don't fall back to evenings only, I don't expect longevity for this place."}
{"text":"Im not sure what these people are talking about. The employees were very tentative. The owner was there and was extremely nice and hands on to help me order. LOVED LOVED LOVED the food. It was different then anywhere else I had been. Not your same old typical salad burgers with fries. Very nice, great food, and good service. NOTE... the bathrooms were very tidy and there was a cleaning log on the wall. also easy to understand what you had to do when you walked in. lol really.... wow"}
