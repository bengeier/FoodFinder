{"text":"Cotto  sandwich with salad made by Claudio was amazing!! dressing on the salad was light and wonderful and we will be coming back"}
{"text":"Food here is delicious. This place just opened up and what I like about it is how fresh the food is. Had the salad with garbanzo beans and red quinoa. My favorite had to be the open faced sandwich called the Smorgas. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Where along the line did the human race change the most important element to survive [Food] to become anything other than healthy?   Thank goodness for this spot. Simple food. Simple recipes with the day's available ingredients  and not the same menu everyday.  No chemicals, everything made from scratch. So nothing is bad for the body and its digestive system.   Bread is literally made fresh in an \"antique\" style oven per say. Waited for a spot like this near my work for a while. Eat in and relax, take it to go or my favorite, sit outside and soak up some vitamin D.   Love it here."}
{"text":"Fire wood oven pizza...  toast... Sandwiches OMG! I love their pizza, their caprese sandwich is one of my favorites, and since I'm here I'll take some loafs  with me! Their tuna toast I def enjoy, it's a nice twist on the traditional tuna salad. It has beans, lentils, potato, vinegar, and deliciousness! My one complaint is that their Nutella loaf is very small..."}
{"text":"We pulled in here for lunch after a futile search for a specific deli. I drove by this gift of food from the gods about 5 times and decided it must be a sign. Divine providence. Have you ever had food so good you would try anything on the menu because your confidence soared at the skills of the maker? We split the turkey sandwich and the cranberry salad. Best sandwich award. It has the absolute perfect ratio of home-made, really tasty bread to really fresh, perfectly seasoned innards. The sandwich bread is thin and completely suited to being a delivery device. Same with the salad, perfectly dressed, not drowning. The green tea not only had flavor, but it was tasty with a nice finish. We topped off with PBJ cookies. So good. The service was just right. Delightful overall."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!  Everything tasted delicious, and I was doubly impressed by the \"uniqueness\" of  each menu item.  I love lentil soup, but have never had any version where the lentils remained so discrete (yet still fully cooked).  It was mixed with farro, which added a pleasant wheat-berry-like texture.  And the bread was to die for!  Perfectly crunchy crust with a simultaneously moist and soft interior.  Loved the taste and texture. Definitely \"cheat-worthy\" (am not supposed to eat gluten).   But most impressive was the cauliflower and oyster-mushroom \"bite,\" which turned out to be far larger than I anticipated.  I love vegetables, but I've never had anything like these.  I have no idea what they did to make them taste so good,  They weren't dripping with oil or anything like that.  And they had the most amazing, delicate texture.  As someone who loves to cook and who especially loves to roast cauliflower, I am completely stumped.  All I know is that I will be back to have them again and again.  I met a friend here for lunch and it was pretty crowded for a Friday morning at 11:20.  We got right in, though, without a wait, and ended up sitting at the last free table.  By the time we left (around 12:30), there was a line going out the door.    Parking was tricky -- I finally parked across the street on the north side of McDowell.  Luckily, there is a light pretty close, so crossing McDowell is not as daunting as it otherwise might be.  The food is definitely worth the drive, and I'm really hoping it doesn't end up having to shut down because it is so off-the-beaten path from lunch traffic downtown."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pure, yet hearty clean eating is what you will experience dining at Noble Eatery! Everything is made to order right before your eyes. The wood-fire brick oven is blazing and as authentic as you can get!"}
{"text":"Place blows my mind every time I walk in the door. Best bread, freshest ingredients and friendliest staff. Eat here. It's delicious."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about going in since it was located between a convenience store and a smoke shop. Once inside, it was pretty nice. The menu is on a chalkboard and they were not able to make something for me besides what was listed, so there isn't much variety. My husband had a grain salad, I had a turkey sandwich and my daughter got a tuna \"toast\". We were all happy with our meals. We got the nutella loaf to share for dessert and although it was ok, it isn't something I would get again.  It is a bit noisy inside because of the stark decor. We thought the prices were reasonable for what you got in size and quality. We do plan to return."}
{"text":"O.m.g.  everything is amazing.  Pretty sure it's almost all organic and the selection changes constantly.  I just wish they were open later! I have fallen in love with 2 new healthy snacks inspired by the chef.  And of course, the bread is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had one of their sandwiches, it had pork loin, cabbage, and apples in between a thin and delicious piece of bread! I wish we had a place like this on the west side! The cashier was friendly and offered help with the menu which he explained very thoroughly!  I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"You will not find a more sophisticated, delicious loaf of bread on the planet.   This is a truly artisan product and the depth of flavor in their bread is simply amazing.  If you haven't tried it, you are missing out.  And the new location at 24th and Campbell is more convenient.    Now, if Jason would just add some hours on the weekend..."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  Lunch is a great size and I always feel like I'm part of the in crowd when eating here.  Jason and his staff really know what they're doing.  This is such a personable friendly restaurant, the food is always on point.  I wish this place were closer so I can conduct all my meetings here.  Support your local business owners!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for lunch - a nice rustic decor.  The gentleman at the register was very helpful.  I personally liked the sandwich/ salad combo. The bread was great - born and raised in Europe so I know good bread.  For a $9 sandwich I felt that they skimped out on the meat.  So now you're probably wondering why the one star. Let me explain. After I placed my order I paid with cash. Immediately after handling my cash the cashier handled \"ready to eat\" food without washing his hands. I also noticed that the guy making my sandwich was not wearing gloves.  There are so many diseases transferred through food contact, particularly C-Diff and Hep A. Sadly, many people continue to not wash their hands following a bathroom break.  I'm not suggesting that all of these folks do not wash their hands.  However, the statistics are against them.  And to give the consumer a peace of mind they should wear gloves.  This is certainly a public health concern.  Until they change their practice I will never eat here again.   P.S.  A close friend of mine contracted c-diff from a restaurant. Believe me it is not something you want to get.  Hence why this experience makes me cringe."}
{"text":"This tiny little restaurant packs in some seriously big flavors and honest, high quality ingredients. Completely worth navigating the cramped parking lot."}
{"text":"Noble Eatery has the best bread in town hands down.  The grain bowl has a little bit too much vinegar for my taste and everything is pretty expensive. A loaf of bread and a sandwich will run you  $20+  Bread is absolutely worth it the sandwiches no so much."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today, ordered their pork sandwich(can't remember the name) and it was delicious!  What a nice surprise, it had very unique flavors and came with a yummy salad. I will definitely be returning, staff was friendly, nice place!"}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh! I've tried almost everything in their menu and they have not let me down!  Love how they have an inconsistent menu! Keeps me guessing everyday ;-)  They are only open for lunch so they get packed, as some users have mentioned, but it's definitely worth the wait! Brick oven pizza, Sandwiches, soups, Salads, lemonade, and dessert! you really can't go wrong with this place!  Business in the front party in the back! The parking lot in the front is a bit limited, but there is parking in the back, along with access to the business right from the back parking lot!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Yes, the bread is really great, and the meats and cheeses tasted good, but I don't like that it comes with a mandatory side salad bundled into the $9 (before tax and tip) price or that the sandwich had items on it not listed in its description (chopped green something).  I also felt the amount of cheese and meat was a little skimpy, as it was roughly the number of slices Subway would use, as opposed to somewhere like Miracle Mile Deli.  The employees were friendly, but there were a LOT of \"friends\" (of the owners and/or workers?) there who received a lot of attention (going behind the counter, obtaining free bread slices).  I feel this makes \"normal\" paying customers feel a little neglected.  Like when cashiers talk to each other (and ignore you) when ringing you up at a store.  I mean, I would've appreciated a slice of bread and you probably could've then tried to sell me a loaf.  Just my two cents on socializing versus selling.  Parking is absolutely, ridiculously inadequate, but this is also an area I would not recommend walking in.  The surrounding low-income neighborhood is not a very good fit for a \"hipster\" (every male there had facial hair, it was almost comical), higher-end (compared to what's in the immediate area, not 5 minutes north), trendy (no set menu, random Italian words) restaurant, but hopefully I am proven wrong.  They have potential, seeing as they are so close to the freeway and traffic on McDowell is not as bad as Indian School (and rent is MUCH lower than Camelback).  On the other hand, the Subway and Wendy's across the street here see MUCH less business than their locations on Camelback and Indian School.  Ways to improve: 1: Print paper (primarily for takeout) menus.  The chalkboard is difficult to read, and if they continue to insist on never having a set menu they might have issues getting regular phone orders.  2: Don't accept food supply deliveries during the lunch rush!  3: Unbundle the side salad from the price of the sandwiches and offer sandwiches for $6-$7 and soup or salad for an additional $3.  4: Offer every single customer a free sample of bread and then ask if they'd like to buy a loaf.  For brownie points, offer to slice the loaf into thick or thin slices for said paying customer!  5: Brand the restaurant \"Noble Bread\" and forget the Eatery sub-brand.  It's splitting yelp reviews and the website redirects anyways.  When you have a strong brand you reinforce it (See: Bianco renaming his \"Italian Restaurant\" to Trattoria Bianco then finally just rebadging it as another Pizzeria Bianco).  6: Include ALL ingredients in a menu item on its written description."}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming as it's set in a seedy strip mall. Don't let that fool you as this place is a hidden gem. The spicy salad and small wood fired pizza's are amazing. They also have amazing desserts like the Nutella loaf. Pricing is very fair and the service is excellent. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The location is inconspicuous from the outside but the food is amazingly fresh, the staff is friendly and the establishment is very clean and neat.  The beautifully crafted entrees are not upstaged by unnecessary flatware or dishes, the food is the focus and it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best little Sandwich/Salad/pizza/toast spot in town.    This neighborhood gem is amazing. If you are looking for good food, you must put Noble Eatery on your short list of places to try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Tried their burrata toast with arugula and prosciutto and grapefruit water. Very fresh and delicious. Portions are small but quality of bread and toppings are unmatched. Only thing that could be better is customer service. A smile of owner's face or people serving would go a long ways in making the experience perfect."}
{"text":"The most delicious sandwich shop in Phoenix! While on the outside the eatery doesn't seem like much (sandwiched between a few other shops in a small strip mall), the interior is quaint and clean. As they are only open for lunch, they do get packed very quickly. Be patient, though, and you should have a wonderful meal.  My party was comprised of lacto-ovo vegetarians. We ordered the vegetable sandwich of the day, the tomato basil soup (after confirming it was safe to eat), the daily pizza (without chorizo), and a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie, eaten before the meal as we got it at checkout, was AMAZING. One of the best cookies I've had as it was chewy, salty, and delicious. Next, we shared a cup of the soup with was easily the best tomato soup I've had! Unlike other tomato soups that taste watery, this one was fresh and flavorful and was the best part of the meal. The veggie sandwich was very good, but it was served on thin bread, not the kind that I usually purchase from them at the farmers market. A bit of a surprise, but still good. It also came with a side salad that was light and flavorful, a perfect accompaniment to my sandwich. Lastly, the pizza! While the pizza certainly could've used the spiciness of the chorizo to shine, it was easily some of the best pizza crust I've had in the area. It was charred without being burnt, it was chewy without being overbearing, and it was topped with some wonderful cheese.  While it might not be the most convenient lunch if you aren't in the area, Noble Eatery is worth your time and effort!"}
{"text":"I waited until I experienced 3 meals at Noble Eatery and I have to say, each was better than the last. I was pleasantly surprised , as great as my first sandwich was, somehow Noble found a way to improve.  The rotating menu is admittedly full of classy food and cured meats that I have no idea what they are, but it's fun to just wing it like I do at dim sum. I can only describe the marriage of fresh bread, hand selected meats, vegetables, and cheeses to be a symphony in my mouth. Great service, friendly crew, and a low key ambiance tie the experience all together.   My only complaint is the driveway position and the parking lot, but that is a City issue and I can add that to my list of complaints about the City."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a sandwich aficionado. I love a good sandwich, and I love making a good sandwich. The Mortadella sandwich here at Noble is easily one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever eaten. Hands down. The tenderness of the meat, along with the soft mozzarella, is complimented perfectly by the hot peppers and arugula - so much so that no other \"stuff\" is necessary. That is the mark of quality ingredients in a sandwich. It all starts and ends with the bread though. Bread makes or breaks a sandwich, and here, the bread is simply top-of-the-foodchain. Similar to Pane Bianco, the bread can't be beat, and makes the rest of the sandwich stand out to well. My sandwich on Friday made my mouth water all weekend long."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that doesn't warrant even three stars. The bread is good, but when was the last time you spent ten bucks on a sandwich just for the bread? I got the open-faced tuna sandwich and was sadly disappointed. It came loaded with a lot of stuff I can't name and probably will never eat again, but it just tasted like a plain tuna sandwich. The decor is of the beat up on purpose variety which perhaps I'm just not hipster enough to appreciate. The server was nice and even gave me a free refill of lemonade, but this is not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Such an amazing little place! Their bread is all homemade in house and is featured in a lot of different places around the area. You can walk out with a loaf, or get one or their menu items with one of their breads of your choice. They have a bunch of different sandwich and toast options. They warm it and lightly toast it in their open oven right in front of you!   I will for sure be coming back cause the avocado toast was amazing! Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"The best tuna sandwich of my life! Today's menu included an open-faced tuna sandwich on delicious fresh bread, and the tuna had fingerling potatoes, cannellini beans, and spelt mixed in with olive oil and a bit of onions. Wonderful.   The grapefruit lemonade was a really fun treat   My new favorite Phoenix lunch spot."}
{"text":"Excellent! High quality ingredients. Olive in the area but work too far to come here regularly but I make sure to have lunch here every time I don't have to be in the office. Sometimes the menu is a little too salami/mortadella heavy but it varies all the time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Noble was pretty okay for lunch. I paid $20 for sandwich and iced tea.. the bread WAS fresh"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've had here has been so good. They have a rotating menu, so it's different all of the time. They post what they have daily on their facebook page which is helpful. Some of the standouts are their panzanella which is lick the bowl good, their torpedo sandwich (which is like an Italian hero) and the pizza. They also have delicious arnold palmers with fresh lemonade and high quality iced tea. Service is always fast, so it's good for a quick lunch. The only downside is, is that they're only open on weekdays. I'm not typically in the area during the week, so I always come here on a holiday or day off which prevents me from visiting here as often as I would like."}
{"text":"It does not get better.   Not in Paris. Not in London. Not in New York. It does not get better.   Having this eatery in my hometown actually makes me proud to live here. Do you know how rare it is to find bread of this quality? Do you? DO YOU?   When that carb life beckons, answer it with Noble Eatery. You will not feel sorry. You will not feel bad. You will feel the purest joy you've ever felt in your life.  Then you will need to go to therapy to discuss how you've fallen in love with bread. It's ok. We can start a support group. I'll bring the snacks."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! If you're looking for a delicious and cozy spot for a lunch meeting or to catch up with old friends, Noble Eatery is the place to go! While they don't have a super large menu, they do have something for everyone! Their menu consists of sandwiches, salads, pizzas, and yummy sides like roasted veggies.   I ordered their ham sandwich on ciabatta bread and holy heaven, it was incredible! The meat was SO fresh and definitely tasted imported, same goes for their cheese, it also had cabbage, house pickles, mustard, and I added their spicy aioli. Perfection! They're known for their bread and it honestly makes a difference in their sandwiches. Simple is better here so that you can taste the freshness in all of their ingredients. Keep your groups to 4 and under because it isn't a super large place but perfect for smaller gatherings.   I'll 100% be back soon! I'm already craving that sandwich again!"}
{"text":"Read some of these reviews and stoped in because of the rave on them! Small but very cute place to get some good pastries! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when you find great bread, you wanna go straight to the source.  The first image that this conjures up for me is the Boudin Bakery in San Francisco.  A majestic bakery right on the Wharf serving up delicious artisan breads with their own sit down restaurant to match.  Boudin's bread is legendary and their bread bowl dishes at their in house restaurant are amazing.  Noble Bread in Phoenix by comparison is new to the scene, though has gained a city full of loyal followers at local restaurants and farmers markets alike.  While their growth has been impressive, so far they still remain just a small scale operation.  But like Boudin, Noble is apparently dipping their toes in the factory restaurant biz, but only just a little.  I'd heard they'd opened their own lunch nook awhile back, but they're only a Monday through Friday lunch operation which makes it almost impossible for me to get to.  Almost.  A day off from the office on a Friday gave me my first opportunity.  As others have described, the space is small.  Seating for maybe 20 inside, and maybe 4 outside.  Here you order at the counter and they bring it out to you.  I should note that the table and chairs feel and sound ancient.  The table and chair I sat in made creaking sounds pretty much my entire visit.  Didn't feel like it would collapse or anything, but just know the furniture is probably super old.  The menu rotates daily so much of what I'm describing probably won't be on the menu again for awhile.  The front is manned by a pair of guys working a wood fired oven for all the various creations of the day.  From todays menu I decided to go with three items.  Their housemade lemonade to drink for starters, plus a cup of their soup of the day, and their stecca of the day (basically a flatbread).  The soup of the day had garbanzo beans (lots of them), plus anaheim chiles and farro (basically wheat grains).  Pretty much a small cup size as advertised and it came out plenty hot, but surprisingly not spicy despite all the chiles. The soup also came with a slice of delicious rye bread for dipping.  I liked the portion of farro and garbanzo beans as I pretty much got a spoonful each time.  The stecca for the day was a whole wheat/rye flatbread mix topped with heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, and smokey ham.  Super fresh tasting dish and I loved the flavor contrast with the smoked ham, though admittedly the portion left me a little wanting.  The lemonade was good though nothing really out of the ordinary.  Total tab for the lemonade, soup, stecca, and tax came to about $18.  The portions are perfect for a light lunch and each of my dishes were ready in less than 5 minutes.  In summary, its a start.  The dishes I had today were quite delicious and Noble's breads are of course awesome.  One negative about Noble Eatery is that you can't buy that many loaves of their artisan breads here (at least not yet).  Seems to me like Noble is missing out on a big opportunity with this.  Additionally, it would be great to have a bigger variety of dishes to choose from.  Maybe Noble is content just to keep this place a small workweek lunch operation, which is fine if you can get here.  But for people like me who work on the west side of town, I'd only be able to get here on a day off.  We'll see where Noble Bread's owners take this operation from here.  There's promise in what they're doing at their restaurant, but it remains to be seen how big their aspirations are."}
{"text":"Got the turkey bacon and cheese sandwich. Nice salad, decent sandwich - was expecting more exciting bread from all I'd heard about them.   I'm not really a sandwich guy, so probably won't hit my rotation, but if you like out-of-the-ordinary sandwich ingredients, maybe this is your spot?"}
{"text":"Fresh and well balanced sandwiches. Great mix of flavors, textures, and temperatures gave a great mouthfeel. Pizza was good, but preferred the sandwich.  Outstanding place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I am NOT disappointed.  The best quality of bread... so worth every bite. Friendly staff,  very happy to help and suggest favorites.  I had two sandwiches,  I've tried the turkey which was good. I took one of the cooks suggestions of the Spaniard and NO REGRETS. I need to be here more, after ordering I saw the avocado toast come out and I know exactly what I'm getting next time!"}
{"text":"As advertised. The bread makes the sandwiches, but everything I've had has been really good."}
{"text":"The open face burratta, as well as the avocado smash, are indulgent options - even for foodies. Their menu provides basics and that's the point: crusty bread and fresh ingredients.  We are quite lucky to have the Noble Eatery in town & prices reasonable compared to the scrutiny and care that they do for their bread and veggie accompaniments."}
{"text":"Literally world class. The bread comes from their local bakery. The greens are the best ever- a great variety of seasonal greens from a local grower. I was impressed by the crisp look and the flavor that matched.  Greens you get at your local organic grocery store are no match. The dressing on the side salad was equally as fresh, homemade and delicious. I had the Italian sandwich. Awesome. I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Fresh made here bread and the food is on point. Large portions with unbelievable flavor. Also the ambiance is one of kind with custom local made creations from Urban Southwest! If you are in the area don't miss this place. The reviews say it all!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  Noble Eatery is in an obscure part of town, but this restaurant makes it a destination.  I loved the rustic feel inside and the smells that welcomed me made me know I was in for a treat once I walked in the doors.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The prosciutto sandwich was absolutely incredible - great quality ingredients and honestly, that bread is to die for."}
{"text":"First stop on our valentines tasting trek, my lady and I had a Vegetali. (Description in the pictures.) let me start off with how fantastic the bread is. Grainy, fluffy with a slightly crunchy exterior, it is wood fire baked. The sandwich had roasted and pickled Anaheim chiles, mushrooms, and greens. It coupled with a small side salad with what appeared to be heirloom tomatoes. The house lemonade was mild and sweet.  The owner was very personable, and equally as excited to talk about our love of food. He even gave us some veg friendly suggestions for our next stops."}
{"text":"Amazing. One word to describe my experience at the newly opened Noble Eatery. The menu changes daily and features a salad, a soup, a smorgas or an open faced sandwich, two closed sandwiches and a dessert item. The ingredients may be be difficult to pronounce, however, it is because chef Claudio knows his stuff and only sources the most original and tasty ingredients. The soup is very filling and the combination of the bitter greens and the beans creates a meal on its' own. But, you cannot stop there, you simply need to eat more. After just two visits i crave their sandwiches; the bread is freshly baked - right in front of your eyes  - in a wood burning oven - they fill the sandwiches with the highest quality meats and cheeses and there is always a surprising ingredient or spice that compliments it perfectly. The salads are crisp and fresh and topped with the best olive oils and vinegars. Also, they work with local farmers and support sustainability which is such an important message.  The eatery is small, but doesn't have a cramped feel to it - it is light and airy and there is constant movement from customers or the employees/owners of Noble Bread. It has a great family feel to the place and you can sense that they truly love what they do.  The location is great, SO close to everything - i would normally have lunched in the Camelback Corridor area, but it is too crowded and not enough great places to eat - Noble is only a few more minutes south and it is easy to get to and I have always found parking. The lot is easy to pull in and out of; traffic on McDowell is not that busy and I found it very easy to get to and to park.  Service is great, simple but great. They use paper plates and plastic (biodegradable) forks and knives and that lends to the ambiance that they have created.  The food is amazing, the breads are superior, the Eatery offers something different; it is healthy, it is unique and it is so delicious that you crave it and you just want to come back for more. Love the venture - please open more locations around the valley!"}
{"text":"Best quick and clean bite in Central Phoenix! Food is fresh, simple, and quick. Claudio is knowledgeable and eager to share the story behind his ingredients. Try the grapefruit fresca and avocado toast, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"To start off I am not a huge sandwich guy, so a $10 sandwich should be an ethereal gift to get my praise.   My $10 tuna \"sandwich here\" was not quite what one would expect. It was more of a tuna bruchetta plate served on 3 thick slices of rustic bread toast. The tun was a caned oil packed tuna, decent quality but still canned with some nuts and grains. On the texture size the nuts and the bread made it a hit, however on the flavor side it need an acid to balance out the flavors.   My biggest gripe was, that I was still hungry after my $10 lunch."}
{"text":"We were looking for a lunch place in Phoenix and found this gem. The avocado toast was amazing. They told us 2.5 avocados per order. The veggie sandwich and chocolate chip cookie were just as good. We are trying to figure out a way to come here again on our trip. So good!"}
{"text":"I had the Italian Chopped Salad and it was superior to most salads anywhere. It was clearly made with fresh ingredients, including the dressing. I can tell by the taste alone that it was made to order, without prepackaged or processed food. Just like I would make for myself at home. Plus they use filtered water so the iced tea was perfect. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This is a casual eatery were you order at the counter and seat yourself. At the time of this review they are only open for lunch Monday threw Friday. Noble Eatery is the restaurant side of Noble Bread. Many of the best Restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area feature Noble Bread. The menu changes daily.  On my visit they offered a house made soup, a couple produce sides, sandwiches made with the signature thin crusty bread pocket and Smorgas.  I saw that smorgas were open faced but didn't know what they were and ordered a tuna smorgas. It was three big chunks of Crusty Noble Bread topped with a mixture of tuna, EVOO, and spelt. It was suppose to also include Home Boy Jalapeño Hot Sauce. They used a very small amount of the sauce because I didn't taste anything jalapeño there. The Bread was excellent but the tuna was just ok to me. I would order a sandwich next time.  The grapefruit and strawberries with wild fennel seeds was very light and refreshing but was very light with the fennel seeds because I didn't get them in many of the bites.  My husband really enjoyed the #2 Fra Mani Sandwich and the canary lentil soup with poblano chilies, farro and kale was good but also was very light with the poblanos because neither of us found them in the soup.  3.5 stars   3-5 stars depending on what you try.  Parking might be tight and the tables are small and some are very close together."}
{"text":"Mr. Claudio has an excellent track record and pedigree and I was certainly excited to try this out.  My expectations* going in were a tad high and I was somewhat underwhelmed with my sandwich.  That won't stop me from coming regularly as these are still great sandwiches.   *Something to compete head to head with Pane Bianco"}
{"text":"This was our first visit for lunch here. We were down town for an appointment & found them on yelp. It is a hidden gem. Love the fresh ingredients, menu is changed daily. I had the Italian sandwich which was amazing. I realized every time I go to the Uptown farmers market we always get bread from them (which is amazing). My boyfriend had the turkey sandwich which was equally as tasty both came with a side arugula salad with a light olive oil dressing. Very healthy portion sizes. Very fast fast, friendly service. I had left my purse at the restaurant it had closed by the time I could get there & one of the employees dropped off my purse at another location so I would be without it over the weekend since they are closed all weekend. I'm so grateful, will be back & definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Another small, unique and really good lunch place. The menu consisted of a tuna bowl which was sold out, a couple sandwiches and a couple of pizzas. I had the remaining thing, a smorgas, which was openface tunafish. Tunafish without mayo but with potatoes, spelt, white beans and olive oil. It was great and it came on three pieces of that wonderful thick crispy bread that came out of their woodfired oven. A simple lunch, and a really good one. Next time it's the pork loin sandwich that looked great."}
{"text":"My \"running partner in crime\" and I finally got to try this hidden gem of a bakery and sandwich shop on Friday and it was like love at first sight!  I ordered the prosciutto and burrata with fresh greens and spices while my friend ordered the tuna salad and we split and shared our dishes. The ingredients alone are so fresh and tasteful that even on their own they made a great meal, but on top of that, they were served on one of the best breads I have ever tasted! These breads at Noble are baked daily and with such simplicity that it's amazing how great they truly are. I had the opportunity to take a loaf home for my hubby to try thanks to the owner and now my hubby is ruined. He keeps comparing other breads we buy to Noble Bread!   I love this bakery shop and will be one of the regulars even if I live a light year away it seems! My friend and I got there right when it opened and it didn't take long for the place to get packed! I wish they were open weekends too!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Smallish urban cafe/bread shop. Has about 6 tables indoor (some communal) and two outdoor tables. Patrons range mostly from the hipsters and business exec crowd. Parking is a little tight but manageable.  Food: Excellently prepared sandwiches (Ham, Salome, Veggie etc) in pita bread form. The breads used are excellent and can be seen being made in the wood fired brick oven behind the counter. Menu offers salad and soup options as well. All the ingredients used are usually high end culinary choices with a bent to Mediterranean cuisine. Veggie options exist as well.  Price: As to be expected the prices here reflect the high end culinary choice ingredients. Average sandwich was $10.50 (includes small salad)"}
{"text":"We had the mortadella sandwich and it was sooooo good. The place filled up for lunch for a weekday, but the staff gets things done quickly with a smile. We loved the food and the friendly service. It's a great casual lunch spot. You line up for your order and then grab a seat. You may want to take the order to go since it looks like seating can become scarce when it's busier."}
{"text":"This place overall is okay, but the high rating is pretty much for their mushroom ricotta honey toast!! That was the most delicious part of my meal and I would definitely come back for that. However, the other items on the menu were okay. Their sandwich was average and seemed like something you could make at home. Their roasted vegetables were not up to par because it was more just warm that roasted even, so I wouldn't recommend getting that. Otherwise, their bread is really good and service was nice, I just was a little disappointed with their sandwiches. Thus I would just recommend getting their bread and toast."}
{"text":"I absolutely love and adore this place. I don't know of another place in town that makes their bread from scratch, the old-fashioned way. By doing so, and using the ingredients they do, people with gluten intolerances can actually eat their bread without having stomach pains (everyone is different, but this is my personal experience). Their bread is sold at all the local farmer's markets, as well as at their store most days. And the bread is so YUMMY! On top of that, this location is the cutest, laid-back eatery! The ambiance is on point, the music is always great, and the service is excellent. I didn't even mention how DELICIOUS their food is! I LOVE their avocado toast, soup of the day, and their hummus plate the best (I'm not a big meat eater). I've heard their meat sandwiches are fantastic, but I can't speak from personal experience. The owner is the friendliest and most knowledgable man, and his employees are fantastic and friendly! I HIGHLY recommend anyone to come down here for lunch or to the farmer's market to grab a loaf of their bread."}
{"text":"Today I had a splendid experience trying out there open faced tuna fish sandwich! I normally don't eat fish but I had a hankering today. The sandwich was amazing and delishus! It was the best tuna fish sandwich I've ever had! Seriously I will be ordering this entrie more often. Eveything I've ordered here is extremely good,every time. Don't forget to try there grapefruit lemon aid. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We come pretty frequently for lunch. We usually get here shortly after 11 because the place fills up quick. I haven't ventured too far from the sandwiches and smorgas (now referred to as toast) but I did try pizza once when it was offered. The food is consistently excellent, as is the service. Super simple, fresh ingredients and the made-from-scratch bread is actually to die for. I was pretty disappointed to learn that Claudio was no longer a co-owner, but the food hasn't changed hardly at all. I'd still like to know where Claudio went. Either way, I really love this place. It's one of my favorites places to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Got take out sandwiches from Noble on Friday.  The open faced tuna was very good and is a creative take on cold tuna. We enjoyed it even though it is very messy to try to pick up and eat.  The other sandwich was prosciutto and fresh mozzarella - there was very little filling in that sandwich and for $10 it was very disappointing.  It would be nice if they were open at least one day on the weekends."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the place. I ordered the burrata and prosciutto and thoroughly enjoyed it. One thing I wouldn't recommend is the iced tea/lemonade. I think I've been too spoiled by Flower Child's and didn't think there was anything special about Noble's drink. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches.  Yummy bread.  Great staff.  No wonder like every restaurant in Phoenix uses them for their bread needs!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. Can't believe I have never tried it since its so close to home.  Ordered the turkey bacon sandwich.  It was amazing. The flatbread and turkey, Swiss were all top notch.  Also tried the hummus and it was also very fresh and tasty.  Prices are on the high side for lunch but the quality is well worth it. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"This is such a great little place!  Get here before or after the lunch crowd as the dining area is tiny and parking is limited.  I've been here twice and had the sandwich with spicy coppa which is delicious.  I'm sure the other menu items are also great but I love this sandwich with a little side salad and homemade lemonade so much I doubt I'll ever try anything else!"}
{"text":"very pricy for the crap they serve...a bowl of \"groats\" that cannot be digested and a pizza with practially nothing on it. Made me terribly sick. never will go back there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Just had ham and cheddar sandwich accompanied by avo on bread. The entire meal was fresh and outstanding. Strongly recommend as a lunch locale."}
{"text":"We've been loyal Noble Bread fans for years (as we purchase it often from the Old Town Farmers Market), so I'm not sure why it took me so long to make my way to dine at Noble Eatery.  Sigh... I didn't realize that I was missing out on what I may possibly now consider my new favorite lunch spot after just one visit.  I love a fast casual concept and this one is no exception.  When you walk in, you are met with smiles from friendly employees and the scrumptious scent of fresh bread.  Check out the menu offerings on the chalkboard (which change daily / seasonally), and then order and pay at the counter.  I don't think you can make a wrong decision as the bites, grains, legumes, salads, and sandwiches all sound pretty delicious and are as fresh as can be.  On a recent visit, I talked my husband into sharing an order of the avocado toast with me.  Three thick slices of avocado+tomato+chimayo chile powder come to the order and it's by far the best avocado toast I've ever had...   I also somehow made room for a chopped salad.  This one comes with spicy salame+provolone+pepperoncini+tomato+oregano vinaigrette.  It's chopped and dressed perfectly and is also an extremely generous portion.  Delicious.  So much in fact that I did not even take a bite of the turkey sandwich that my husband ordered, despite the fact that he raved about it.  Needless to say, we left Noble Eatery with extremely full bellies and beyond satisfied with the experience.  I am already dreaming of my next visit and that avocado toast..."}
{"text":"Lovely rustic Italian sandwiches made with wood-fired breads, fresh local cheeses, veggies and meats; an ever-changing menu based on local ingredients and the chef's creative whims."}
{"text":"Came in to this gem with a few friends of mine.  We ordered every item on the menu.    I enjoyed an acai cherry tea which was bright and delightful.  The cashier came by later for refills which was nice!!  I can't begin to remember the names of the menu items as there were many a foreign language included, but I did take a picture of it so please feel free to look at that!   We started with a tomato salad, grapefruit salad and a salad of greens.  All of which were fresh and flavorful.  What I found so incredible was that I'm not a fan of the extreme tartness and bitterness of grapefruit in general, but the vinaigrette tamed that completely and created a beautiful and very palatable flavor with amazing juiciness, just amazing.  The tomato salad pairs perfectly with the bread that Noble is so well known for! In addition to the salads we tried the lentil soup, deep rich flavor almost meaty, but completely vegetarian.  I was blown away by the \"starters\".  Then came the sandwiches made on these pillows of bread baked fresh when ordered.  The first of which was so simple: prosciutto with mozzarella, but the quality of ingredients were just stellar! The second was turkey served with a poblano pepper I believe and I honestly couldn't pick out ingredients, but the flavor was on point and again the ingredients so fresh and delicious!! These were phenomenal sandwiches!!!  And for the piece de resistance?!? The sweet plate made with noble bread toast points, amazing medjol dates and date syrup.  It just tempered my sweet cravings and finished the meal perfectly!!!   I will be back! Time and time again and I suggest you do the same!!!"}
{"text":"Actually my second visit. On my first they were profusely apologetic saying that \"we are out of food.\" On this visit, although about the same time (1:30 PM), they had ample food.  Very cute, nicely redone place with friendly service, obviously interested Cooks or Preparers and a great reputation for fabulous bread.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be another in a series or recent disappointments, but in this case only a  minor disappointment.  First, let me say that the ingredients are all here, I believe. Especially the creativity of putting ingredients together in an unusual and attractive manner. It just needs some \"tweaking,\" including a look at their pricing structure for their location. Otherwise, I worry about their long-term viability. I will divide my Review into:                                           The good - The Bad - The Ugly  THE GOOD: As mentioned their ingredients are pretty terrific. The Prosciutto and Parmesan on my sandwich were quite wonderful and certainly a combination I never would have thought of. The Bean Soup was AMAZING with wonderful taste, although the beans could have been not quite so hard. The STAFF is FABULOUS! At no time did the young woman taking orders and checking on diners not have a broad smile on her face. Wonderful and warm! There is obvious pride on display here.  THE BAD: NOT nearly enough of the main ingredients on the sandwich! In order to actually taste the Prosciutto and Parmesan I had to take some off of the sandwich. The chosen bread for the sandwich was the Chibata and that might NOT have been the best choice. The attending salad (with the sandwich) was nothing special, although the pickled carrots were very well done, although sparse.  THE UGLY: For the price point (almost $!6.00 plus tip for lunch!) plastic utensils and a tiny Styrofoam soup bowl have got  to go! They should invest in a dishwasher in order to be first class with silver and china, NOT to mention they will be \"Greener!\"  The price ($5) for the miniscule portion of soup (far less than a teacup!) can be raised, given the quality I tasted, with a bigger portion. The Price of Sandwiches can and should be lowered a bit (Under $9) with more of the important ingredients and served without a salad. Can/should have a \"Side Salad\" with more ingredients, which seems to be their specialty, and priced separately.  Quality is 4  1/2 Stars and it is obvious they care about quality. The drawbacks (price, disposables, improper portions and proportions) lower their overall score but there is GREAT promise here! I will be back!  I want badly for this dinning alternative to make it here as I am in this exact location almost five days a week. I hope they do, but they should consider some small changes to make it even a better experience."}
{"text":"Incredible, freshly prepared sandwiches on par with the best in town! The place is small so if you're there over the business lunch hour, be prepared to do the table dance until you can find a place to sit. Parking is a bit of an issue but hey - some of these inconveniences are due to the success of Noble. The word is out and Noble is an amazing gem."}
{"text":"I knew my mom would love this place, so brought her here for lunch during her last visit. The place is amazing! Friendly staff and delicious food. We split the trifecta because choosing just one topping is impossible. The toppings are piled on the best bread ever! We ordered a loaf to take home and couldn't resist the oatmeal cherry cookie at the register. Noble Eatery, ILY."}
{"text":"Over priced cold sandwiches with the noise level is way over the top   Not a good place to converse with the person across the table or enjoy your lunch.   Too bad that this is not a place that you can sit and enjoy because the only good thing about this experience was the bread !"}
{"text":"Wow! My expectations for this place were pretty high due to hearing about it from a friend at work and reading the reviews here on Yelp. And I have to admit I was not disappointed! I was so torn on what to order since everything sounded so good. But I had read another Yelper's review that mentioned the \"Trifecta\" so I went ahead and gave it a try. You get to select 3 of the various Toasts they offer. I went with the Avocado, the Burrata, and the Roasted Mushroom. Now I have had Avocado toast in the past but none have been this good or this stacked with avocado! The Burrata one was not lacking either with a huge portion of cheese laying on a bed of arugula with diced tomatoes and drizzled with basil oil. The Roasted Mushroom one was also delicious and paired well with the whipped ricotta cheese it sat upon. I loved how there were different varieties of mushrooms in the mix. And did I mention that all of these glorious toppings were served on their famous Noble bread? Their bread is so good that it doesn't even need any accompaniments. My friend opted for the Tuna Toast and I have to admit that I didn't care much for it and neither did she. Apparently it is a mixture of tuna, potatoes, greens, and beans but to me it had too much vinegar or lemon in it and the taste overpowered the actual taste of tuna. It is a pretty small place and the menu is written up on the wall as they want to ensure freshness which I really appreciate! The only thing that was a little disconcerting was the fact that it was kind of hard to cut the crusts on my toasts as the utensils they provide are made of plastic. Not that big of a deal. I definitely want to return some day to try their salads and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE SANDWICHES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY!  The only sandwich that I've had that even compares to this is at Pane Bianco.  This place might even be better. Well done Sir!  Easily in the top two best sandwich places in the whole valley."}
{"text":"Love this local eatery. Limited but inspired menu of fresh and delicious daily items. Loved the watermelon water. Helpful staff who are willing to adjust their menu for the picky eater. They bake and sell their bread onsite. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here on a spur for lunch during a meeting. Little gem in this area. Cute industrial feel inside and quite popular.   I'm gluten free and came in knowing they didn't serve my type of bread. But they let me order the veggie bites with the fixings of the ham and cheddar sandwich mixed inside. It was delicious. The addition of arugula was amazing. The cheddar was a lovely thinly sliced sharp cheddar. Quite filling. Ham was pleasantly smoked, nice flavour.   Topped it off with a green tea iced tea. Truly a great refreshing \"dessert\".   My coworkers had a variety of gluten items and said the bread was not to be wasted. Ate it all!  Will be back."}
{"text":"OBSESSED! Such a hidden gem. One of my favorite places to eat for lunch. I love how the menu varies from day to day. The bread is SO delicious and the meat is very fresh. I have yet to order something I did not like."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! What a wonderful place for a quick yummy healthy lunch. My only complaint...I'm gluten free and couldn't enjoy their yummy breads except to smell them! Ha! Had a wonderful chopped salad with spicy salami. Their other salads and sandwiches looked amazing too.  The atmosphere is cute and casual. Fabulous lunch spot just south of the Biltmore area. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wish I worked in this area so I could eat here all the time! Noble is a charming lunch spot with great sandwiches. I arrived a little before noon on a Friday to get lunch to go, and many of the tables were already occupied with people enjoying their food and drinks. There was no line at the counter though, and they took my order right away. The service was excellent; the man and woman who helped me were really friendly and when my food was ready (no more than five minutes after I ordered) they brought it out to me in a to-go container with a fork and napkins.   I had a veggie sandwich that had portobello, mashed sweet potato, greens, and herbs tucked into Noble's yummy homemade bread. It was delicious. It also came with a salad, which was amazing. They really don't skimp on the sides here- the side salad consisted of a variety of really nice greens (I think arugula, some mache, and something else) and a light, tangy dressing. I also had a black iced tea. Only down side about Noble is that it is slightly pricey ($13+ tip for my sandwich and tea), but I think it is well worth it for the quality of ingredients and service.   There are several tables inside and a few out front, so there are plenty of places to sit and enjoy. The atmosphere is really comfortable, and it was fun to watch them cooking (or toasting?) bread in the brick oven."}
{"text":"Stopped by after reading an article about meals under $10- got the recommended tuna on toast while the husband ordered the Cuban... delicious, however, the star is the bread. Chewy, crusty and flavorful....so good we bought a loaf to take home.  BTW...meals are over $10 now...my article was over a year old."}
{"text":"A new go-to spot for \"midday meals\", as they have cleverly coined. Don't let this unpretentious location fool you at first glance while driving down McDowell, the food is absolutely exceptional. From phenomenal soups & salad's, expertly executed legumes to gourmet wood fired sandwiches, its first class.  Well known valley chef Claudio Urciuoli and Noble Bread founder Jason Roducha have teamed up for a winner here. Fresh, clean, simple yet delicious gourmet comfort food that is sure to please.  A phenomenal take out option as well if you're a nearby biz."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Their sandwiches with the side salad was awesome, their food was well prepared and you can tell that the owner put some thought into their menu."}
{"text":"Soooooooo Good! The simplicity and freshness of the food is divine. I love the idea of doing a few things really well with the highest quality ingredients and that's what you get here. Best bread in Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"Noble eatery is one of Phoenix's undervalued gems. Every item on the menu (all the way down to the ice they use for your drink) is meticulously executed using only the best ingredients. The food is above and beyond five-star worthy and the ambiance and new location really pull everything together."}
{"text":"This place was made for me sandwiches, salads and fresh lemonade. It's a bit on the pricey side but if you want to splurge a little then it's a must!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh healthy delicious great food and fast friendly service from nice people! The lemonade was the bomb too! Stoked to find this gem in an apparent wasteland of mediocre at best food in this neighborhood, at least from what a visitor can find. Would return any time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I stopped by just before their Friday lunch rush.  I picked up a couple loaves of bread and a salad.  The salad was a great lunch sized portion.  It was very flavorful and tasty.  Both loaves of bread were fresh and had great texture."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich, fresh ingredients owner is great and always there.  Try and go early before 11:30 or after 1:30.  The place is busy for a reason.  Solid food."}
{"text":"it was our last day in phoenix for a while and we needed somewhere close but delicious to close out the week before we head home - noble eatery was perfect. nestled in a small strip mall off of camelback and 24th, we each got 3 different kinds of toasts on their housemade bread that was warm and inviting. we tried - the mushroom, avocado, and burrata + prosciutto - all were yum- for a little over $15 - not cheap but the ingredients were really quality and the service was friendly. the shop is small but clean - we shared a picnic table with a few others also enjoying a lunch break from a smoldering summer day in phoenix.  the toasts were very filling and tasted healthy - which is huge :)  i would try a sandwich next time, or even their personal pizzas.  well done noble!"}
{"text":"The freshest ingredients around including the bread. The sandwich, with salad, is $9 but worth every penny. The ingredients are the highest quality and you can really taste that. This is not a deli, Subway or Wildflower....this is high quality, locally sourced ingredients. Even the EVOO was just pressed yesterday. The soup is delicious but a little on the small side. You have to buy a loaf of their scrumptious bread to devour later of course. I think the disposable plates should give way to real utensils.The menu is on a chalkboard because its constantly changing depending on what is fresh/best that day. A real gem. Parking is tight."}
{"text":"I love this spot. I'm glad to see they'll be moving locations though. Given Noble's quality and popularity, their current digs are just too small...and if you sit outside you'll be feet away from oncoming traffic.   Noble has a very earthy, yet contemporary decor. Their crowned jewel is the huge chalkboard that showcases all the seasonal, farm to table items they have listed that day. I also really enjoy that they put out samples of their delicious bread to nibble on  It felt like a sin not to get a sandwich at a shop with the best bread in town, but I went rogue. Their Peruvian bean soup didn't amaze. It had the right amount of salt and delicate vegetables, but the base was a little light. The roasted veggies dish was wonderful. The brussel sprouts and cauliflower were the bees knees. Cooked perfectly with some charred sprouts for flavor. They were coated with a creamy lemony sauce that kicked it up a notch further. I will be coming here for many moons."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Destiny's Child - No, No, No)  You be singing, \"No, no, no, Noble\" when I'm really, \"Yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelping\" You be singing, \"No, no, no, Noble\" when I'm really, \"Yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelping\" You be singing, \"No, no, no, Noble\" when I'm really, \"Yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelping\" You be singing, \"No, no, no, Noble\" when I'm really, \"Yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelping\"  Bread, I know I want some, I can taste it at your place And you keep on bakin' - Won't you say what's in your dough? Cause each and every time I'm near you, you give me thrills And when I ask you what's that smell, you tell me to come inside!   Noble Eatery is one of city gems that deserves the buzz from locals when visitors come to the valley.  The place is small and dink but the lunch crowd manages.  The ambiance is like walking into an antique shop with fire oven blazing away, while patrons gaze at the bread basket displays; carefully choosing and deciding what their palates are saying to them.  I came with my sister for a quick lunch break.  She ordered their turkey sandwich while I went for the burrata toast.  Atop my toast was burrata, tomatoes, arugula, and lightly sprinkled with some basil oil.  The bread was fresh and soft with the crust providing a much welcoming crunch.  The burrata cheese was like eating clouds with the basil oil adding a hint of sweetness along with the tomatoes.  The arugula was slightly bitter which help balance out the meal.  My sister and I finished by buying a loaf of bread; the walnut cranberry.  I must say I was full but when I got home I couldn't help but continue eating the bread!  In the end, Noble Eatery deserves my love and recommendation for a hot spot to hit if you're ever in town.  The serve up some delectable bites, but buy some bread along the way! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Get the turkey sandwich.  So good.  You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Loved this spot for a healthy post hike lunch! We had the tuna, avocado toast and the tomato cheese as well as the delicious iced tea. Friendly service. Typical gross strip mall location, but that's typical for the valley."}
{"text":"Delicious unique lunch offerings.  Wood-fired bread, detailed attention to ingredients, great meats, fresh vegetables.  A fantastic treat for foodies.  I visited this place once and have come back again and again.  The menu is on a chalkboard and changes regularly.  I look forward to every visit and tasting what is on the menu for the day.  Dishes are typically about $9 - $11.  Worth every penny to get some truly good food."}
{"text":"Please please please spend money here and show them we want them to stay in our neighborhood!!!   I had lunch here today and it was terrific. Think Pane Bianco if you need a reference for the kind of food they serve, as well as the ambience. I had the Cattle Bean soup with farro and quinoa, which was hearty and delicious.   Then I had one of the sandwiches with thin-sliced salame, cheddar, olive oil, and Anaheim chiles. There was a generous helping of butter lettuce and rainbow carrot salad on the side. The bread on the sandwiches is thin and pillowy with a crispy exterior and chewy interior. Really, really flavorful.   I couldn't leave without trying the \"Small Bite\" of grapefruit, marinated celery, and sliced castelvetrano olives. The celery was sliced thin like slivered almonds and delivered the perfect crunch against the grapefruit and olives.   I hope people seek Noble Eatery out. I will get back there soon."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to check this place out as I'm a big fan of the Noble breads sold at the store.  Tiny place but clean inside and a cool chalkboard menu.  I went with the sausage sandwich - the sandwich was good, but not great, was expecting more flavor and I felt it needed a crusty type of bread.  I liked the fact it came with a salad.  Service is very good and I will probably return to try other items.  Expect to pay around 11 bucks for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I'm going to start with the main negative about this place.  Parking here is the absolute worst.  If you come at any busy time, the basically 6 spots out front will not do.  And when it's crowded, getting in and out can be a bear.  That being said, the food is excellent.    Menu changes daily.  Salads, sandwiches, soups, and smorgas (open faced sandwiches basically.)  Sometimes some other bites, sometimes some collaboration dishes, always organic and locally sourced.  I have enjoyed all his sandwiches but my favorites have been his collaborations with Little Miss BBQ and his use of their meat.  These are excellent.  The best smorga that I ever had was topped with a crab meat salad, also delicious.  His bites are typically some warmed vegetable dish but varies and I've never been disappointed in them.  Frankly, I've never really been disappointed in any dish here, just underwhelmed sometimes.    So, despite the parking situation, I reluctantly tell people about this place and tell them to come often, despite the worsening of the parking situation for me.  Delicious, local food needs to be supported."}
{"text":"Sandwiches embody the Italian three to five perfectly matched ingredient philosophy. The bread is outstanding. Cannot wait to try the salads and smorgas. Thank you Claudio and team!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread is just phenomenal. It's thin, so it's not overpowering, and the flavor is outstanding. Seriously, the balance is perfect. After the first bite, all I could think of is when I'll be able to go back. I work up north a bit, but it's right off the 51, so the trek isn't bad. The only negative to this place is that it isn't open for dinner or on the weekends. It was quiet today for lunch, but I can't see it stating that way for long. Can I go back yet?"}
{"text":"Went for the bread, stayed for the sandwich. Finely crafted sandwiches that are sure to please even the pickiest palate. Fresh, flavorful mixed greens compliment the main dish. Great lunch spot.   Parking is a little tough at times but worth the fight!"}
{"text":"Too cute for words! All bread made on site and they put it to such good use with this gorgeous little eatery. For such a small place they've made good use of the space and have a little something for everyone. Locally owned and independent, support this awesome place!"}
{"text":"All I can say is...WOW!  The food is amazing, and the atmosphere feels like a local Italian market with rustic tables and chairs, and a lively menu chalk board with delectable lunch options. AND you must leave with at least one loaf of Jason's award winning Italian bread to take home with you.  Always a pleasure Jason!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried at Noble Eatery exceeded our expectations. The food is fresh, unique and made with love. Took home a few loaves of bread, which I cannot get enough of! Awesome job, Noble Eatery, can't wait to come back and enjoy more delightful food."}
{"text":"After my eyes were opened about the bread we consume from the Cooked series on Netflix, I am very thankful for this place."}
{"text":"Bad vibes and good food. It's so drab. Everyones pretty unfriendly :/ The music is really quiet so the atmosphere is not very inviting especially since the staff is lame.  Food: Skip the veggies. They weren't great. The Italian sandwich is incredible! But beware... the menu seems to change daily so if you're having a craving for something pray it's available."}
{"text":"This is a normal lunch place with normal sandwiches, they're just superior in all ways.   The bread is the best thing since sliced bread. Inside, no compromise on quality is made. There's just enough plant-thing and spice element to add interest, but not to distract from the purity of the main ingredients. Meats and cheeses are thoughtfully combined and generally the bee's knees (like turkey from Little Miss BBQ.)   Noble is a standard-setter. There's nothing extra, nothing shmancy, but nothing is left to be desired."}
{"text":"Awesome service and unbelievable food. If you haven't tried this place give it a try and you will be hooked!!  The bread in this place is the best I've ever had.  I will be back very soon to try more recreations that they have to offer.  Thanks Noble Eatery"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch in this modern-rustic kitchen a couple weeks back. We were fortunate enough to get the last table available at high noon, and Jess - such a friendly hostess and server - got us a second chair from the back.   The menu changes and is written on a chalkboard and consists of soups, sandwiches, smorgas (open sandwiches), small bites and sweets. These aren't your basic ham-n-cheese sandwiches by any means. These are quality cured meats sourced from Creminelli http://www.creminelli.com , Fra'mani http://www.framani.com , La Quercia http://laquercia.us , and Little Miss BBQ http://www.littlemissbbq.com (local to Phoenix!) You're also getting organic produce and grains.   We started with the soup - garbanzo bean, red quinoa, harissa, olio nuovo (freshest possible EVO you can find).  The soup was good but lacked a bit of depth that I was expecting. The harissa gave it a nice warmth though and I will say that the ingredients were cooked perfectly (if you've ever had an overcooked garbanzo bean, you know what I'm saying!)   The sandwiches were divine - on of course, Noble Bread! One was La Quercia's prosciutto Americano with parmesan and mizuna, the other was Creminelli's cotto with NY cheddar and Anaheim chiles. Somewhat similar in flavor as you'd expect, but the cotto/cheddar was a bit dryer than the prosciutto/parm. We were OK with both sandwiches being \"ham-style\" but I could see how others may wish there had been another choice of sandwich. We enjoyed the fresh mini-apples from California and the olives on the side, but as an afterthought, I was hankering for an additional something crunchy.  Maybe some organic chips or kale chips?  I don't know if this could be down the road but I surely would go for it!   The parking lot is tiny and tricky so perhaps park elsewhere and walk a bit. I imagine that this fine little kitchen will only get busier. I lean toward calling it \"kitchen\" since you are sitting in a cozy room and there is an open wood-fire oven going behind the prep line. It has a homey feel to it and that is communicated as well by the warmth of the owners, Claudio and Jason, and as mentioned, Jess.  Thanks for the hospitality and a wonderful lunch! Looking forward to more mid-day munches."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoy coming for lunch, whether with co-workers (this is now their favorite place to come for lunch), or with my family. The menu can vary daily, so if you find a favorite sandwich on a particular bread, it may not be here the next time.   Wonderful burrata, roasted mushroom or  avocado toast. Amazing Italian, turkey (and on occasion, roast beef), vegetali sandwiches. Don't hesitate to try the roasted veggies (with a light sherry dressing) or the hummus  Take any of their breads home - you aren't going to find anything better here in town  If you want a tasteless, cheap sandwich just to fill your stomach, you can go to some other chain sandwich shop - if you want an outstanding sandwich, salad or toast and enjoy some of the best bread you will ever eat - then come here to Noble Eatery.  Of note, the parking lot isn't huge, and if you aren't using your mapping app, you may drive right by. Noble Eatery is on the east side of 24th Street, directly across from St. Thomas the Apostle (school), and just north of Campbell. (At least there is more parking here now than there was when Noble was located on McDowell Road)"}
{"text":"First timer here after hearing a lot of great things. This place lives up to the hype no doubt. Some of the best bread I've ever enjoyed on a sandwich and the spring salad is fresh. High quality ingredients and a friendly staff too. Expect to wait 10-20 minutes after your order to receive your food, as it is busy during lunch and it's a small place. Not a lot of seating either so maybe ask for the food to go just in case. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this lovely new restaurant. I was worried I wouldn't have an opportunity to try it, as it's only open for lunch Monday through Friday (and I generally work those days far far away), BUT they were open for MLK day... huzzah! I went in at about 1:30 and was surprised by how cute this place is set up. It's tiny, but this is kind of neat because you can see their beautiful oven, all the fresh loaves of bread, and many of the local ingredients they sell and use in this establishment. Unfortunately, when we got there they were out of the two items I wanted to try - the smorgas and the soup.... oh man! Next time I'll have to come earlier. The husband and I ended up sharing the roasted beet salad and the little miss BBQ turkey sandwich. The salad was divine.... the husband even liked the beets and he HATES beets. They were so tender and sweet... delicious. The dressing was light, but perfectly seasoned. It had small sections of citrus in it that added a bit of acid... it was great. The sandwich was also wonderful. The turkey was smokey and delicious, the cheese was creamy, the bread was very flavorful  and the perfect amount of crunchy and chewy in texture. The sandwich had wonderful peppers on it that added another level to the flavor of the sandwich. It was certainly one of the best turkey sandwiches I have ever had. The sandwich came with an apple and an olive (maybe they ran out of something? not sure). The only problem? For the prices, the portions were a bit small... I don't know if it was because it was the end of their shift, but it was a very light meal for the price. Will I be back? Yes, of course. It was delicious. Would I like a touch more food? Maybe a protein in the salad (for 9$ especially), yes, that would be nice. Also, pretty please open one day on the weekend??? See you on the next holiday!"}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes across town because I heard this place was so great. Got there at 1:30, an hour and a half before they close, and they were all out of food! Nothing. Zilch. Zero. That's not cool. How do you not have enough food to last until you close? I grabbed a loaf of bread and headed home. The loaf was pretty good, but I'm very disappointed that I drove that far and couldn't even order a sandwich or anything."}
{"text":"Update: pepper, mushroom, beet sandwich .... not really to my liking. but I still like this place overall!"}
{"text":"Fresh Authentic Rustic. New location really convenient.   We had a fantastic Spicy Coppa with Irish Cheddar sandwich -  it was superb. Also had some kind of Bean Swiss Char soup that was equally wonderful. Everything was so fresh and of such high quality you could actually taste the ingredients in each bite.  And of course all on the famous Noble Bread.  You won't be able to resist buying a loaf to take home either - so forget the carb counting when you come here. Wonderful wait staff.     You need to get there early or after the lunch crowd since the place is really smalOther than that total perfection!"}
{"text":"When I die and (hopefully) go to heaven, the cafeteria will look and taste like Noble eatery. Don't tell your friends but please go there enough so it stays in business but not so much that I can't get a seat or food. The bread is 100% the best in the world."}
{"text":"What a pleasant find! The home made bread is delicious! Generous portions that are fresh and well thought out. The turkey, bacon and cheddar sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time and was finally able to try it today. I read the reviews about how it's busy during lunch time so I called my order in.  The guy who took my order was not friendly at all, extremely short and rude. I explained to him I was not familiar with the place. Didn't have any problems picking up the order. The place was empty and parking was easy. Find out my sandwich is missing hummus and I ordered two vegetarian sandwiches. The website said it came with hummus. So to my surprise I just paid $22 for bread lettuce and mushrooms. I called and told the guy my sandwich was missing the hummus. He said the vegetali doesn't have hummus on it \"today\". Great. The website said that sandwich came with hummus and that's the reason I ordered it. Didn't offer me a refund, credit, or an exchange. Really disappointed in the customer service. However, the bread was good, the mushrooms were marinated and the sandwich would have been great with hummus lol. I was really looking forward to ordered bread from here for the holidays. Unfortunately, I don't think I will return."}
