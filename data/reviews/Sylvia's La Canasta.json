{"text":"On two occasions I visited this La Canasta and an Female employee(she is gay) was making out with her girlfriend in the eating area...we didn't wanna see that while we were eating. And the time before that we had ate here and they were doing the same thing. They let their employees make out with their mate while on the job, that's disgusting!! Grabbing each others breast, making hickeys, just doing the most!!  July 10, 2015"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and never got my order.  After 20 minutes of waiting and watching three groups after us get their orders, I went up to ask about my food.  My colleague already got his order (we ordered together and I paid for the entire order), but mine somehow \"disappeared\".  I was told they were really busy and that one of their employees had left.  Usually their food is pretty good, but they didn't seem to care about service at all.  I never got my food...my colleague had finished and we had to get back to work.  I asked for my money back, and when I got back to the office realized they shorted me 57 cents.  I WILL NOT GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the drive thru this morning for two chorizo burritos. It was 7:11 and the young woman told me that they weren't ready yet. So I asked if they opened at 7. She said they did but weren't ready but added what did I want to order. I told her the two burritos, she checked with someone in the back and said that they could make them but it would be a little bit. While I was there someone else came through the drive thru behind me. So I wasn't the only one expecting them to be ready at 7. I got my order, checked my bag and there were two unmarked burritos with 4 salsas and some napkins. Originally I took a picture of the sign that said, \"Check you're order before you leave\", to show my daughter the bad grammar. Little did I know that it would apply to my own order. Now the bean burrito that I got instead was tasty, as usual, but it wasn't what I ordered. I was disappointed that they weren't ready for business at 7 but to bite into the wrong burrito just ruined the whole experience. I've been long time customer of the Canasta family, this one and S. 7th Ave, and I'll probably go back but you bet your bottom dollar I'll ask them to mark the burritos, or make them open them, if I am getting them to go."}
{"text":"UGH, I am so frustrated to feel the need to leave such a rotten review.  But this place is SO ROTTEN people should know it is no longer what it used to be! The only reason I'm leaving one star is because you can't leave a negative!   Horrible.  I have no clue how they stay open.   Check out the photo of the cheese-less cheese crisp.  And I'm not even sure it was real cheese.  And the beans-   I think the salt shaker top fell off into the pot. Salt is meant for enhancing NOT meant as a flavor!  Clearly the employees and owners don't care whether or not folks return.   I WONT be that's for sure!  HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Ok, so first off if you are in a hurry don't think going through the drive-thru will save any time at all. Just went today during my lunch half hour and spent the whole time waiting for my food. One car was ahead of me that I waited at least 15 mins for and they got one bag of food, should have know then just to pull through and keep going! Second, they raised the prices by at least $2.00 on most items which is actually ridiculous at least if the food was good it would be justified but it is not at all. After I waited over 20 mins for a simple order of chips with green chile poured over them it they were not even good at all cold in some areas and hardly any meat at all just a thick gross sauce.Third, the customer service is totally non-existent you would think after waiting so long you would get some sort of apology or gee thanks for waiting but nothing at all not even during the transaction or after!!!! Just avoid this place and save yourself some frustration!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good tasting, but the prices went really up. I had #12 green burro with rice and beans. Burro was mostly gravy, less meat than before. Chips and salsa bar had no salsa, only hot sauce. Cashier said they don't have it anymore. Really? Hot sauce was good though. If you like the food, better to go to the 7th avenue location downtown. Better prices, better food, still have salsa."}
{"text":"This place use to be so good and now it's crap if the food isn't wrong it's cold and it doesn't end there. The customer service is horrible like your bothering them by placing an order. Please get it together maybe my last time there."}
{"text":"Just a little dive on Indian School Rd. with a lot of history. Now I might have been born here, but I grew up in SoCal! My father was born and raised here, never leaving this area. He had told me a story how as a little boy is mother sent him to the neighbors to get some tamales. As it turns out it was Sylvia? He was a devoted customer and has brought some of their food home to share with me. I really enjoyed their tamales and chili Verde! Wife and daughter enjoys their enchiladas, their sauce is almost like a mole sauce. Over all, very good food, location is not that great, but don't be scared!"}
{"text":"The chimichanga was sooo good. Cute little restaurant with fantastic customer service. Really good beans too!"}
{"text":"I grew up with La Canasta as part of our family for 40 years, my aunts and uncles worked there as teens in high school. Ever since they have broken off from being a traditional family restaurant  The quality of the food had gone to poop. For over 30 years I have taken my family to enjoy what I used to believe is good traditional homemade Mexican food. It's so sad and I'm discussed with how you have chosen to serve your food cold and making us feel so unwelcomed and cheap. Never again will anyone I know eat at La Canasta. I will cook my own real, fresh, hot Mexican foods for now on. DONT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT DIARRHEA AFTER EAT COLD, COAGULATED, SOGGY FOOD. La Canasta just ruined one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! The girl in the front looks like she HATES her job! The order was all wrong but didn't complain because we waited over 30 min to get our burritos. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"I love canasta food... But it is not the same... I ordered the green chili burrito lunch special that comes with a taco and a drink... And when I got home to eat my green chili burrito it was only three pieces of meat in my burrito and the rest was all gravy and tortilla... I was not happy, so I called and spoke with the person that was in charge and they told me that is how they serve their burritos... Not happy! The flavor of the food is very good but the portion is very bad... I do not believe I will be going there anytime soon and maybe not anytime later..."}
{"text":"It should be giving 0 stars if you ask me. Based on customer service if your looking for. It. You may not find it here I couldn't even Order anything the lady at the counter is the rudest person I have ever came across I ask 1question about a item on the menu and she gave me the nastiest attitude so if you Order something here make sure to not ask any  ? About the food so disappointed"}
{"text":"I love eating at La Canasta but this right here is unacceptable one of the driest tamales I've ever had! Won't be back over here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because the food is good, but the staff is horrible. Two days ago I took my family's through the drive thru, it was 106 degrees, the lady said please hold. Ok. 5 minutes later I ask if she's still there - no response. I drive up to the window and still no response. She looks over at us and walked away. We left.  Now I have been here a few times before and they all seem to share the same I don't care attitude. The food is good and reasonably inexpensive, but the owners seriously need to critically evaluate their staff."}
{"text":"So I'm kinda shocked. This place has such a nasty review. The food is good and there's little wait. I've eaten here 3 times and will come back. A lot of co-workers eat here often as well. The only thing that's bad is the building. Ran down a bit and the amount of space to order your food is limited. Other then that I found the price is reasonable and service was acceptable. But food has been good all three times."}
{"text":"Normally this place is pretty good (red chili burritos) but the prices seem to be rising, and the service and food has been lacking as of late. Went by for a navajo taco a couple of weeks ago and they were out. What? Today, out of Pepsi. The red chili burrito was good, but the boat of their flour chips were disgusting and were immediately tossed in the garbage. They were STALE (who knows how old they were) and tasted like they were fried in rancid oil. If they can't be bothered to offer fresh chips (they aren't cheap!) they shouldn't be on the menu! And if they weren't a few miles away, I would have went back for a refund! Get it together Sylvia's!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood restaurant -  food came quick & made to order. Owner made sure that I was happy with the food made me feel welcomed."}
