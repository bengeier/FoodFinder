{"text":"What a horrible experience: I placed a reservation on Thursday for the next day, and when I showed up on Friday night, the restaurant was closed!!! 
Did they not know the restaurant will be closed the next day when I placed my reservation? And if they didn't, was it too hard to give me a phone call? 
I am not setting my foot there again."}
{"text":"I literally did not eat my meal:

The menu listed \"White Seabass\" but what I was served was clearly not, based on the color of the flesh and skin.  If it was White Seabass, it was frozen improperly or spoiled to generate that color.  After the first bite, it was clear that the fish was severely overcooked, to the extent of being inedible.  Still, starved I took a few more bites.  Each bite contained one or more pin bones, which is a sign that staff did not know how to prepare the fillet.  

After eating 5% of the meal, I stopped and made a comment to the waitress about the fish.  She took the plate and did not offer a replacement or a refund.  

I had to leave and eat dinner elsewhere after paying a rather large bill for my \"meal\"."}
{"text":"We requested a burger from off the menu, and it was completely overlooked. Sent it back and was done correctly the second time, but no bargain. The \"big ass burger\" at Roaring Fork is far superior. We also ordered the prime rib and it was cooked correctly but came to the table cold. The sides were less than average. Everything in general was way over priced for the quality. 

In addition, the waitress was rather unpleasant. She was borderline rude and had a definite negative attitude."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! I went for a dinning experience but was given a below average restaurant experience. Let me start off by saying I've been in the industry for years and previously worked at a Marriott in California.  We came early and had a couple drinks at the bar our reservation was at 7:30 and we were seated promptly so far so good. We ordered our appetizers and a bottle of wine apps came out first ok I'll give you a pass on that then came the disappointments.  Steak was overcooked lob Mac and cheese was luke warm these things happen but what frusterated me was the fact that between the apps and when we got our food we waited a hour. They brought out the wrong order and our server only came to the table one time while we were waiting and again shortly after the correct order was brought to the table.  Not once did she offer to do anything to fix the problem and made a weak excuse on why it took so long to get our order out. Diddnt expect this type of service from the Marriott much less a JW Marriott. She also had the audacity to include the tip... we used a Groupon maybe that's why we got the service we did but even with that we spent over 200 dollars."}
{"text":"We dined with a Travelzoo deal of $79 for two and still paid an additional $77!  It wAS an additional $10 total for two 12 oz rib eyes and $19 in cocktails and they automatically add 20% gratuity ($30).  Service was excellent, the beef cheek appetizer and the banana creme pie were exceptional but the rib eyes were not that melt in your mouth, moaning, cant wait to take your next bite experience.  It's a nice restaurant but it won't be on our list of places to dine when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were warmly greeted & had great service. We sat outside on a Sunday morning which was lovely. I like that she left a bottle filled with water at the table. It's a nice touch since the water glasses are small. When we ordered our breakfast we found them to be very accommodating with making changes to menu items. You can also order lunch items at 9:00 am. In fact I ordered a salad to go so that I could have it at dinner time since I wouldn't be able to go out and grab something and was staying at the attached hotel. I had the 2 eggs and chicken/apple sausage. They have a multi grain toast that was really great, even without butter."}
{"text":"My family and I had an amazing dinner on Thanksgiving! We had one main server, but all the staff pitched in and helped each other! We were especially impressed with the bartender Paul who not only made exceptional drinks, but was so friendly and accommodating when we walked in and much to our surprise even through dinner!  He came to our table when the bar looked slow and checked on our table! Never ever have we been somewhere with this kind of service from a bartender! We would come back just to sit at the bar and eat if we could be served by Paul! Thanks for an awesome Thanksgiving experience! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for a special dinner and we absolutely loved the place! Had the seafood platter to start which was amazing.

We went with a New York strip medium rare and a Filet medium- similar to another review I saw on here they switched the cooks on the steaks so they may have a slight communication issue on their meat section. I'm a big medium rare guy and i have to say that the new york strip had SO much flavor at medium I couldn't bring myself to waste a gorgeous steak so kept mine, but had them refire my girlfriend's filet. The manager personally escorted the steak back to our table to ensure that it was too our liking- many times a refire doesn't turn out well and comes back way over done and dry- they came back like it was medium the whole time, so they did an excellent job and we were quite satisfied. This was handled in such a way that I feel that this still warranted a 5 star review especially based on the rest of the meal.

For the steak sauces I did the blue cheese butter and she did the peppecorn demi glace... I have to say I loved the blue cheese butter but the demi was OUT OF THIS WORLD good! Highly recommend it.

For sides we did mushrooms and mac and cheese which was FANTASTIC- use a little bit of that demi sauce for the mushrooms, trust me :)

I've noticed many positive reviews for their waiter Jerome and I want to reiterate as well that his service was nothing short of fantastic, some of the best I've had in a fine dining restaurant. Friendly but not fake and attentive but not overbearing. I think it's incredibly important to recognize great service when you get it and I'm glad to see others as well- the excellent service more than made up for the mishap in the steaks so it's the service that made this a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"We are staying at the resort and my husband wanted a steak, so despite the bad reviews we thought we would give it a try. 

Steak was ok. Prices were very high, service was slow and snotty. Had the goat cheese salad. Not only was there very little goat cheese, there was very little salad. Asparagras came with the steak, he got 2 pieces. 

Should have paid attention to the reviews. 

Don't waste your money, unless you want to end us paying $60+  for a steak and not much else."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased the TravelZoo deal as well and have to agree with another Yelper...not as impressed as we'd hoped to have been. The pre-selected menu had good options and while nothing spectacular the food was still good. However, I have noticed since purchasing not only this restaurant deal but others as well, there is a stigma that comes with buying a \"discount\" meal-deal. You are definitely not treated the same as the full paying customers - and Meritage Steakhouse was a prime example of that treatment. After our experience, I'm glad we had purchased this deal for a dinner out - had we not, I would have been even more dissapointed for spending that much on a mediocre meal, at best."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp review before I brought my family there.  However, unlike it mentioned in the reviews, this is a premium steakhouse located in a  5-star Marriott Resort next to its Pro golf Shop.  Most of its customers are business people and casual dressing is not recommended although it is not prohibited.  Main courses (steaks) are amazing and priced between $38 and $50.  Therefore, it shall be a $$$$ (over $60 pp) instead of $$$ restaurant.  You can choose the salt among 6 different styles of sea salt and 5 different kinds of steak source.  The menu is ala carte therefore, sharing side and appetizers are common.  The $17 appetizer \"tower of sea food\" is well-worth its price, that includes half lobster, 2 oysters, 2 jumbo shrimps, 2 crab legs.  The steaks and seafood are perfect.  Unfortunately, Arizona law prohibits customer to bring their own wine, which is not accustomed by Californian like us.   The waitress and waiters service is 5-star.  After all, we had a great dinner with higher price that was not originally expected."}
{"text":"We were there two consecutive days for the LPGA Golf tournament, neither day were they busy when we were there.  The bar and wait staff were attentive, but the kitchen seemed to be in disarray.  They lost our meal orders on both days!  It took 45 minutes for lunch to arrive one day and a half hour for a simple bar order of sweet potato fries to arrive,  the wait staff discounted our ticket and compted us some food and drinks to compensate.  The kitchen organization needs serious attention.  however, the quality of the food when it finally arrived was good."}
{"text":"\"Ok\".  Service was not great at all.  Asked for steak medium rare but was rare and had to send back.

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was awful! Waited 45 minutes for the bill with no apology. Was made to feel like a fool for asking for an explination of the bill and was forced to pay 18% gratuity for a party of 2. Will never return. ( Waiter's name was Jerome )"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, our server Marko was incredibly attentive and polite. Good steaks and great wine selection, in a nice but relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The kitchen service here was absolutely terrible. They ruined an entire evening for a large party of 20 of us. I say kitchen service because the servers themselves were very nice but the kitchen  took over an HOUR to get our food out. We arrived at 7:45 and weren't able to get out until 8:30. This is NOT a Michelin 3 star restaurant where one would expect a 3 hour seating. This is an average hotel steak house.

The hotel failed to book our reservation in properly. They had asked us weeks before if we wanted to sign what would have been a $4000 contract for a 20 person dinner in a private room. $200/head? Ridiculous. We said no and that we'd just like a regular table or group of tables. They said fine. When we arrived they said they didn't have a reservation for us because we didn't sign a contract. We explained that we didn't want a private room and already discussed this with their groups coordinator.

It was us, another large group (who has made their reservation earlier that day), and a couple random tables. Not busy at all. It was a Monday at a hotel restaurant. When we began to complain about the wait time the manager was super rude and blamed us for not properly booking a reservation. I once again explained that we had book a reservation many days earlier and THEY had failed to properly record it. Regardless, if you can't serve someone efficiently, why seat us at all? Just say your kitchen or staff can't accommodate us. There are only 4 other steak houses in the area that would have been glad to have us that night. Finally, one of the servers at the end of the night started to rudely explain to me how we should be happy they accommodated us and how we shouldn't be upset about the wait.

So in summary, the restaurant didn't keep a reservation, was basically empty when we showed up, except for one other large group and then blamed us for their slow service. I do a lot of conferences at this property and will never utilize this restaurant again unless they can offer some kind of apology. The fact that they blame me for their issues is what makes me never want to come back. Take some ownership for your problems."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars because the service was very good and the sides were very good.my wife ordered the 6 once fillet medium, it came out well done. I ordered the Prime Rib Medium, it came out rare. I sent mine back to be cooked more, when it came back still rare. We took the steaks home, then threw them in garbage. The lobster mac and cheese was great, so was the creamed spinach. So for $180.00 we got 2 glasses of wine, a salad the 2 sides"}
{"text":"We decided to try Meritage despite mixed reviews since we were staying at Desert Ridge (week of 5/16/11). What a disappointing mistake. 

After ordering our meals, we were served a pale and lifeless loaf of bread. It tasted as good as it looked. 

A short time later our salads arrived. I had the Meritage salad - it was overdressed and had just a scant trace of goat cheese. My husband had the Caesar - it was also overdressed and kind of skimpy. I would tell you about the flavor if I could but our waiter demolished mine with so much pepper (despite being told twice to stop) I'm not sure. Caesar was just ok. 

We both had the filet. I ordered the steak medium with bearnaise and a side of asparagus. I was served an almost raw piece of meat. This wasn't pink folks it was red/purple. Flavor was ok. This could have been a great steak if someone competent had been behind the stove. Asparagus was very good. Bearnaise was bland. Second steak was ordered medium rare - it was raw. 

When our waiter came to take our plates he hesitated but asked nothing about the two almost completely untouched filets. 

As we were waiting for dessert, a server attempted to pour tap water into our glasses despite the fact that there was a bottle of Pellegrino on the table. When I stopped her she advised that some people like having water added to their Pellegrino - give me a break, just say you're sorry for the mistake.  

Dessert came in the form of seven layer chocolate cake and banana cream pie. Cake was just ok and the cookie on the plate was burned. Banana cream pie was still frozen at the bottom and the fruit was mushy.  When  the server came by to remove our desserts she asked if we were too full to eat them, when we advised that they were terrible she said \"oh I'm sorry\" and that was the end of the discussion. 

I overheard two other tables send back their steaks because they were undercooked. We chose not to bother. If they were interested, someone would have asked about our meals. I have a feeling that no one asked about our meal or service because they knew both were poor.

If you're looking for a great steak restaurant, skip Meritage."}
{"text":"We were staying at the JW Marriott and I took a group of people to this restaurant for dinner.  We ordered drinks and it took our waitress over 10 minutes to serve us, although the restaurant was not crowded. This was the overall theme of the night at Meritage.  Several people in my party ordered the 20 ounce bone in ribeye and we they all felt it was an overpriced average steak at best.  In addition, our waitress actually asked one of the guest at the table if it was \"OK\" to reuse his glass and ice when he reorder another drink. He laughed and said \"OK\" and she made a rude comment as she walked away (I am pretty sure her name was Lori).  I spent over $1200 for a party of eight and the food was average and the service was below average at best.  Do not waste your time at this restaurant! If you stay at the JW Marriott, go to Roy's which had much better food and service."}
{"text":"Large resorts with several restaurants may run the risk of suffering from large scale banquet-like cuisine, but not here! Meritage was a terrific surprise. Lovely and delicious prime rib. My wife and I both ordered a 10oz rare cut it was cooked perfectly rare but tipped the scales well over 10oz, a nice treat. Scallops with a sunchoke purée were amazing. Best scallops we've had since we lived in New England almost 20years ago; they were cooked perfectly and the genuine scallop flavor was prominent.  Creative and well crafted cocktails. Attentive but not intrusive service. Terrific all around. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the restaurant with a groupon the other evening and enjoyed a great meal. We live in the neighborhood and have frequented the bar for drinks and appetizers in the past. My husband ordered the steelhead trout and it was cooked to perfection with extra crispy skin. I chose a salad made with local McClendon greens tossed with a lemon vinaigrette and I added smoked flakey salmon. It was perfect. I asked for rolls and the server brought three warm potato rolls with a savory butter. The service was attentive and I could see a manager overseeing the dining room. They also have a good selection of local beers on tap."}
{"text":"Jerome made our dinner experience great. All his suggestions and recommendations were exactly what he said they were. We each had a glass of wine (happy hour), shared the lobster Mac, beet salad and twice baked potatoes. Hubby had the salmon and I had the pork chop. Protein was cooked perfectly. Wonderful flavors in all the other dishes. Complimentary banana cream pie all for $100 before tax. Glad we chose this place for our last night in Pheonix."}
{"text":"The service was so slow, my steak arrived cold and the sides were only mediocre. I would not go back even if it was free."}
{"text":"We have dined at Roy's several times- food is fabulous. & service is wonderful. I anticipated the same from Meritage but was disappointed. The service was poor- now I did use a groupon so I can only assume that is the culprit! I had to ask for bread & frequently had to pour our water. Food was good but not stellar & at the end of the dinner we still owed $100- and the less than stellar service included an 18% gratuity! 

We have no problem paying premium for a wonderful meal there are basic expectations at this level. Unfortunately the Meritage did not rise to the occasion. We will not return- even with a discount!"}
{"text":"Great food and service at this urban gastropub. Chef Phillip Keppler has created a wide ranging menu from perfectly prepared steaks to sumptuous pub burgers. 

I have gone there with my wife for date night as well as hosted a family \"party of eight\" feast. 

All are well cared for including our two toddler grandchildren.  Chef Phillip assured their was ample selections for my vegetarian daughter."}
{"text":"We travel quite a bit and the dinner here was excellent , Marco was an awesome waiter and really pointed out some wonderful choices! The cowboy steak was my favorite and the prime rib and fillet were great also! Mark the supervisor checked in on us to make sure everything was top notch, kudos to meritage!!!"}
{"text":"Like the first reviewer can't believe no one else has reviewed it. We had one of there martinis to start along with a chef compliment of a shrimp with crandberry walnuts, my wife has soft shell allergies, and they brought a tomato mozzarella compliment, both very good. Our first course was Tomato Bisque and French Onion Soup, a nice portion. 
Our entree was Filet Mignon and Veal Strip, both grill perfectly, along with choice of sauce/butter and sea salt. What was nice, is the sauce or butter is on the side so you can put as much as you would like on your steak. Along with our steak, we selected Creamed Spinach, Asparagus, and Mac & Cheese, all $8 each. We ordered a half bottle of Plumpjack Cab, went great with our meal. For dessert, we decided on the Chocolate S'mores Cheesecake very rich, but very good.
Service was great, and just enough attention, that made for a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The customer service was fantastic. The portions were small, but I left satisfied after the wine and bread/butter. Not to mention dessert. They accomodated my vegetarian preferences and the chef designed a fabulous portabello creation for me. They did not overcharge, either... Overall, a good fine dining experience."}
{"text":"We went in this place for a birthday dinner with higher expectation. Unfortunately, the food wasn't good at all, it was just okay. There were a lot of crews at that time however the service was so slow. We waited for our drinks for almost 45 minutes. The place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great, and it was just an overall great experience. 

I'm from Los Angeles and I am an avid steakhouse connoisseur and this is at the top of my list. It exceeded my expectations with the ribeye steak and filet as well as the potatoes au gratin.

Definitely a must for someone on vacation."}
{"text":"The restaurant was accommodating when we asked for the dinner menu at lunch. Steaks were outstanding the New York Strip bone-in was so tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"So I'm from Minnesota and this is February and I'm eating outdoors on a perfect weather evening - but this was a delightful dinner. Just me on business travel, had a great drink Old Flames to start. Chopped Salad was good but large for starter, but the Chilean Sea Bass - on lentils and greens - was fabulous! Cappucino after dinner as the stars came out was perfect nightcap. Server Laurie gave just the right amount of attention to make me feel welcome. A lovely evening."}
{"text":"We dined at Meritage and thought it was OK.  

We purchased the coupon on Travel Zoo; a predetermined chef's menu was presented with the wine list as we sat down.

Menu - all meats were available with potatoes and asparagus; nothing exciting about the sides: potatoes were too smooth and the asparagus was over cooked.  It was nice that they gave us the option to upgrade our meats; but the prices were a bit high.  Wine was reasonably priced.

Bread was better than described in a previous review...actually we thought it was the best part of the dinner.

Salad and soup: I had the Meritage salad which was ok, nothing too exciting and husband had the french onion soup which was good but had too much bread and cheese on top.

I had the salmon - over cooked and didn't have the same garnish that was in the description of the menu...husband had the prime rib and said it was OK.

Desert: we had the seven layer cake...and it didn't taste fresh...like it had been sitting out for a while.  We split a piece and took the other home.

Overall...we spent too much for dinner that should have been great!  I wouldn't waste your time or money especially if you have a favorite steak house that is better than OK."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night and we liked it a lot. Good was good. Everything was clean and the staff was friendly. A bit overpriced for tavern food, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was average. If you are looking for a great steakhouse, look elsewhere. This is a 2 star hotel meal. Ordered a $40 steak (sides separate). Tastes more like Sizzler than a high end steak house."}
{"text":"We've been in twice for date nights and look forward to returning!

The service is excellent, and if you go early enough, you should walk around the JW since it's absolutely gorgeous.  

The prices are pretty steep, but if you're OK forking over some cash for a quality meal, you shouldn't be disappointed.  

Our favorite appetizer is the lobster mac n cheese.  YUM.

The first time we came in, both my girlfriend and I got food poisoning from something we ate at the restaurant.  This definitely spooked us from returning, but the very kind manager convinced us to come back, and our second visit was absolutely perfect.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place for sometime, so finally decided to make some reservations and try it out.

We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed.  Standard Country Club/Steakhouse decor, very cowboy/wild west.  Casual attire is fine here, as we were WAY overdressed.

The host was a bit snippy but aside from the interaction with her, the rest of the evening was delighful.  

The menu had a good selection.  For our app we got the seafood platter.  Oysters, lobster tail, crab legs, and jumbo prawn.  Everything was halved and nighly prepared with a selection of dipping sauces and lemon.

My bf got the 12oz NY Strip and I have never seen a man enjoy a steak as much as he did.  He usually enjoys a better cut of steak but craving something different and he was impressed.  He got the Blue cheese butter to go with it and raved about this steak for days.

I got the 6 oz filet medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The accompaniments were the cream of spinach and the twice baked potato and it was just amazing.

For desert we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb cobbler with basil gelato and it was delightful.  

The service was outstanding and really helpful and we never went without.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, we had dinner here, we had the  prime rib and it was  cooked to perfection, our server Jerome was great and  very attentive, we had dinner out on the patio because it was a little  loud inside but that's ok everyone was having a good time, thanks Jerome that made our  evening."}
{"text":"Excellent onion soup.  Worth the trip for the soup.  Generous portions.  The aged steak was a bit dry for the price."}
{"text":"We went to the Meritage Steakhouse today.

We were met with an indifferent greeting by the Maitre D' and were seated promptly.

Our waiter Jerome was upbeat, pleasant and fast in an efficient, graceful way.  

We ordered the Seafood Platter as an appetizer and it was very good. 

Our main course were two different types of steak. I ordered Medium Rare, if in doubt err on  the rare side and my wife ordered Medium.   Our sides were asparagus and twice baked potatoes.

The steaks arrived unfortunately done in each other's requested state.  Mine arrived Medium to medium well and my wife's a very medium rare.  

Not a big deal we just switched steaks despite them being different cuts.

The asaragus varied from a perfect  crispy to wet and soggy.  They had obviously mixed our asaragus with some that was lying around.

The twice baked potatoes were good.

Desert was creme brulee (very good) and the chocolate cake which was also good. Our coffee and cappuccino were very good.

For the price paid I was disappointed.  I would have gladly paid more at Morton's or Fleming's.  For the same money Ruth's Chris or The Keg would have been a better bet.

I am giving this two stars due to the fantastic service provided by Jerome."}
{"text":"If your a foodie like ME, walking into this restaurant is going to make you want to walk right back out.. I'm not saying give it a chance, but go with your gut instinct ;) lets just say you take the plunge :0. .. Every server here is Eastern European descent. I'm German descent, American raised though. These people treat your table like it's a poker table, they just wanna get shit done. That's the service I experienced, nothing American, so to speak. Moving on, so I don't become overwhelmed with myself,the food. Eeeeerrrrgggfml, the chilled seafood (shellfish) platter ($30, not the point, but still wtf) left me thinking, who really is this lame? JW Marriott? No way! Well maybe .. Cuz this platter looks like an unfinished unedited unreviewed drunken thought that the chef passed out on!! Too bad my server recommended it... The summer squash salad was the highlight of this dinner, like I always say when it comes down to earths produce, it did all the work, man just cut it up! Way to go earth! Ur squash rocks. Next up! The steaks.. I had the NYstrip, MW, it was done well, and tasted right, they gained a star.. The mushrooms on the other hand were basic bitches. Oyster n shiitake, w thyme. Everyone knows thyme makes basic bitches old.. The wine was ok. The end.. Go to Roy's. :)"}
{"text":"Came to Meritage for lunch and had a friendly waitstaff Tabarak. She was so sweet and great with our boys! I highly recommend the Meritage burger and the Gaduji (not sure if I spelled right) chocolate crunch bar!"}
{"text":"We went to Meritage tonight and were very pleasantly surprised. We weren't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews. The atmosphere is fantastic, cozy, and rustic. Absolutely beautiful inside and out. I had the burger, cooked to perfection, with some really delicious fries. My husband had the Chilean Sea Bass and he said it was delicious too. We were both part of the Clean Plate Club. LOL Service was great and friendly. A bit pricey but you're at a golf club at the JW Marriott so you kind of expect that. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 6 oz filet and forged mushrooms.  Wow - the food is fantastic. I will return for sure.  I recommend YOU to try it."}
{"text":"Ate here as we are hotel guests and didn't want to go far. Decor very nice - comfortable. Decent menu and drink list, mediocre service. Empty restaurant and still waiting, or trying to take plates before we were done. Spinach dip to start was very small portion and basically cheese soup with spinach. All 4 of us got steak - all cooked to perfection. Sides left a lot to be desired - potato au gratin a small portion and sub par. Dessert menu not enticing. Only thing saving this place is steak, decor, ability to walk for hotel guests."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner after purchasing a great voucher off of Travel Zoo. The food and service were great, with large portions and a good selection of organic meant and fish. Everything was prepared the way we requested and pricing was reasonable.

The atmosphere wasn't anything too exciting, but that's pretty normal for a resort restaurant in AZ. We were there on a Monday night in summer and it was pretty packed, which is always a good sign. I would definitely eat here again if offered a chance, but wouldn't recommend this if you are seeking a more traditional steakhouse feel, like Flemings or Mastro's."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place anything special. 
We opted, all 6 of us, for the 29.99 early dining special which we knew resulted in smaller portions but didn't realize that we'd be treated like peasants because we all ordered off of the early dinner menu. Mind you we were the only patrons at a table while the bar area was full of golfers who came in from the course to drink and get apps. 

Food was mediocre too. The prime rib was TOUGH! Desserts were good, Caesar salad dressing was very very anchovy salty and I LOVE anchovies. 

Hostess had an edge to her. Not sure if it was a cultural thing but just rubbed me the wrong way. I would so never go back."}
{"text":"Since we're staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge, we decided to try the steakhouse. My 6 oz filet was possibly the best I've ever had. The shareable sides are perfect for two people. But, the icing on cake was actually the pie. The banana cream pie with an Oreo crust was unbelievable. The dinner was pricey, but was worth it for a special treat."}
{"text":"We had a really good time at their beer and food pairing dinner event. Food was delicious and beers were perfectly selected for each course. I would definitely attend another one in the future."}
{"text":"#meritageurbantavern we saw advertisements such as this about their grand opening, so me and my boyfriend who live in a neighborhood nearby, decided to walk there tonight and enjoy the new venue. It was closed! No reason given, no one to talk to us, and no post on any social media, which we follow for the @jwdesertridge - which is very disappointing. Unlikely we will take the time to come back. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"We could have had a great meal. The food was up to steakhouse standards: not the absolute best but good enough to be enjoyed. One friend had great prime rib and I had a good \"shoulder\" tenderloin and our wives enjoyed soup and sides and I had good asparagus. The wine list had good, reasonably priced bottles of red. Unfortunately, there were  several very large groups. That took away servers from regular tables of diners. The only way we got the attention of our waiter was by calling the manager and placing a drink order with him. The waiter  was clearly offended but he did provide service after that.  Unfortunately large convention groups get to drinking then shout at each  other. The atmosphere in the restaurant was unbearable. When the manager or maitre d' came by to ask how things were we expressed our distress but he didn't act impressed. A gesture on his part, such as offering dessert or a simple apology would have meant something. As it is, I think before reserving a table, I would advise prospective diners to ask about large groups. This hotel attracts conventions, I guess.  Of course, some restaurants might close to other diners with several dozen in large groups. Bad service and customer disrespect were not intended but resulted from this evening.  Obviously this restaurant can do better when it cares to. The Yelp reviews show it."}
{"text":"The place: it is located at the JW Marriot resort and SPA. It has outdoor and indoor seating. Inside it is very spacious and nicely decorated.  Outside there are a few tables and firepits. If you can handle the heat I suggest you seat outside. The view is really nice. 

The food: I am not going to lie, the food was nothing extraordinary. Nothing I had was memorable that would make me want to go back for more. I am not saying it is bad it is just ok. 

The Service: as with any of the places at the JW Marriott the first I was asked was if I had a reservation. Not sure why because the place was not even half full. We were promptly seated and our waitress took our order right away. Every body there was really nice and were on top of our every need. 

Overall, the place is nice and clean. The service is great and ready to help. The food is ok but nothing that would make me want to come back for more."}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner using a gift Groupon and we had a interesting time.

Meritage is a steakhouse located inside the Desert Ridge Marriott and has a captured clientele.  It has a bar area nearby and can get very busy with everyone coming and going through the restaurant from playing golf.  I do not know the hotel well enough to know if this is the unofficial 19th hole, or if there is another reason for the confusion.  But it clearly detracts from the relaxed feel of an upscale steakhouse.

As for the food, one of us had Chicken Breast and the other a Filet Mignon. It was priced close to what you would expect to pay at Morton's, Ruth's Chris or the Capital Grille, but without the extras that those steakhouses normally provide.

The wait staff was excellent and made up for our nonplussed meal. If it wasn't for the gift card, we probably would never have came here.  Sadly, given our experience we will stay closer to Kierland if we want steak.  There at least, we can hear our conversation and not be distracted by folks walking by our table every few minutes.

If you do not mind a short ten minute ride, I would highly recommend you explore the Scottsdale Road/Kierland area as a alternative.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Date night with the hubby never disappoints because he picks really cool places for us to try out! 

We really enjoyed the Meritage Steakhouse.  It is located at the JW Marriott Hotel near Desert Ridge Mall.  The service was excellent; friendly and non-intrusive--just the way I like it. The food was very good. Not the best steak I've ever had, but I certainly wouldn't kick it out of bed in the morning either if you know what I mean. 

I ordered from the Sunset menu, which is a prix fix menu that is available before 6:30PM. Our reservation was right at 6:30 so I thought it was nice that they still offered it.  I had the Meritage salad, the Filet Mignon, and creme brule as well as a flight of wines that were most delish. The salad was a mixed greens type salad with a rather tart dressing. Not so tart that I couldn't finish, but tart enough to say...wow this is tart. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium, just the way I like it.  It had a sauce on it that I was unfamiliar with that made it a bit sweeter than I'd like. For me, I prefer my steak naked because I want to enjoy the integrity of the meat itself...but whatever. I scraped off what I could and did my best with it.  It was accompanied by several stalks of very hearty asparagus and yukon gold mashed potatoes. The asparagus was peeled where it should be and it was cooked to al-dente perfection. The potatoes were creamy and tasty, but could have used a bit more seasoning to them. The creme brulee for dessert was very nice as well...but if you screw up creme brulee you might as well hang up your apron.

Hubby had the NY Strip with peppercorn sauce which he enjoys well done. It was cooked PERFECTLY and not dried out or overcooked in any way.  They also put his sauce on this side, which I would have preferred myself, but oh well. He had the twice baked potatoes for his side which was very creamy and cheese. He had the wedge which came with a slice of pancetta on top. Always have to have bacon on the wedge. For dessert he had a banana cream pie which was very clever. It was a chocolate mini pie shell filled with banana cream filling and topped with a length-wise slice of dried banana that was tossed with cinnamon and sugar. It was very cool and quite tasty.

We dined al-fresco as it seemed most of the other patrons chose as well. It was a lovely patio with a nice fire-pit nearby. 

All in all a very nice dining experience and I'll definitely look forward to going back and trying some of their other selections!"}
{"text":"Good steakhouse.  My steak was great and the sauces and salts you add on made it mire interesting than a usual steakhouse.  Almost all members of the party were satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Outstanding fine dining experience. Excellent food, unintrusive service. The atmosphere is very quiet, and conducive to a lovely, romantic evening out. Though I have seen reviews claiming that service was found wanting if one used a Travelzoo voucher or Groupon, however I did use a voucher, and the service was impeccable regardless. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We dined at the Meritage for brunch on New Years Day. 

The ambiance for bunch is bright, inviting, and pleasant. The table and chairs were comfortable and a bit oversized, which I find that I like best. We were seated near a large window with a beautiful view. 

My family and I dressed up, but most people there were dressed down in sweats and jeans. Note to self for future reference! Also, the bar area had all the day's football games on its multiple screens. Good place to catch a game!

The food was awesome. We ordered the binets to start, which were fried exactly to our liking. My dad and I ordered a hash and my mom ordered the pancakes. All were delicious. The coffee was a bit strong, but who doesn't need strong coffee on New Years Day?

The Meritage lost a star with me due to oddly inconsistent service. Our primary server was on his game and extremely hospitable, but his assistant was in charge of our table for a bit and was either very new or poor at being a server. We asked for drinks that we never received, extra cream that never arrived, etc. So, if you go, FYI."}
{"text":"Poor service and not prepared well.
That is the review 
Don't need to say much more
Sent steaks back 2 times.  
And it is a steak place
Enough said"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and delicious food!! A little pricey but worth it!  Wait staff is very knowledgeable and very helpful.  We got there early and had a drink at the bar, then went to the table. It wasn't that busy, but got full very fast.  Nice sitting outside in the warmer season."}
{"text":"The steak was fantastic, but the rest of the menu left me wishing for a fast food. The mushrooms were burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. The creamed spinach was like eating shoelaces. I tried the Butternut Squash bisque which was inedible. The salad was sour. The trio chocolate torte was good, but it could not fix the damage done. A way to look at this was someone punches you in the face and then gives you 5 bucks. You feel hurt and the payoff was weak."}
{"text":"If staying at the hotel, the resort fee includes a free appetizer or desert for each entree ordered. They give little extras that are special. Tonight's was an amuse starter which was a little crustini with a bit of crab salad.  We savored each bite of the pork belly appetizer (which was free with our hotel stay), then enjoyed the fresh pop of the pomegranate seeds mixed with the jicama and greens in a delicious white balsamic dressing in the Meritage salad. The lobster tail was sweet and tender. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The food was so yummy. Best wedge salad I have ever had. Shared a 12  oz NY Stip and they split the plate for is. Lots of flavor and cooked perfectly. Would definitely recommend trying the Mead flight for Predcott Meadery - really tasty. You should give it a try. We will be back. Nice ambience as well."}
{"text":"So far, not good.  Appetizers were served barely warm.  The scallops were under cooked and my oxtail tortellini was too salty.  The iceberg wedge was flavorless due to the watery yogurt dressing.   Now some good news.  We ordered another appetizer which was the beet salad.  Wow!!!  The beets were served with creamy goat cheese, sugared pecans and sliced, pickled beets.  Steaks were good, but if you are going for the meat, there're other steak houses in town that serve a better product."}
{"text":"My friends and I came into Meritage for a nice happy hour and it was the best service and attention I've ever received from a restaurant staff. Troy made some amazing drinks! Chef Richard has such a talent as well, the food was phenomenal. Thank you for such an enjoyable evening! Loved Rodica as well, awesome staff!! :)"}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal food and it's nice and peaceful to sit outside.  They apparently don't do brunch anymore even though google and all the other sites say it opens at 9. We sat there ( door were wide open) for 30 minutes- Tvs were on, lights were on and no one around. I had to call the Marriott to find out they don't do brunch anymore. Is it that hard to follow through and get it changed online or put up a sign? I love local and come quite a bit but that's pretty bad."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Jerome and other members of the service staff. The lobster macaroni and cheese was very good. Tasty and creamy. There was enough for a meal in itself. The tuna tataki was also good.  But the main dishes were lacking something; like a sauce or gravy. The wild mushroom which was a side dish would benefit from a wine sauce. The same could be said about the asparagus. The complementary mini root beer float was nice. My overall impression is great service, nice scenery but average food, over hyped and over priced."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet! 
This steakhouse is definitely in my top 5, not because I like the steak but because they have a great fish selection as well. 
This is one of those fancy smazy places that serve you the \"Compliments of the Chef\". It was basically a crouton, with a couple pieces of corn and a smear of corn cream. Funny.
But my scallops were done to perfection, cooked just a bit with a pomegranate glaze. Yummy. And they gave me more than 3 which at most places seem to be standard. We had all ordered some sides as well. Since the wine was more than flowing I can't remember what I had other than the brussel sprouts. I can remember eating those since I never eat them but I was forced to try and I actually liked! 
I was there with a large crazy drunk group and the waitress held her own around us. Because the sides showed up way after our main course was there she gave our group a free bottle of wine....nice!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this Steakhouse, I purchased a Travelzoo voucher and the reservation host was rude and not very helpful when i explained which days would work for my family to dine since my Son is in college, when I asked for a Manager I was given the run around, first I was told please hold , then that the Manager was not available, followed by the Manager would contact me, which I never received a reply. Thank goodness Travelzoo  
was understanding and refunded me. Ruth Chris for me!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: An upscale restaurant/bar on JW Marriot property which primarily serves golfers on the adjacent Wildfire Golf course. It's exceptional well designed with two patios, one with gas fire pit and the other with a small enclosed lawn area for corn-hole and bacci ball.  Inside there's a beautiful bar as well as several tables/booths.  There are several flat screen TV's covering sporting events (usually golf). The interior successfully blends the atmosphere of a upscale golf club with a gastropub. Patrons are white collars, golfers and families.

Food/Drink: The lunch and dinner menu includes many high end offerings with a gastropub feel.  The appetizers are great as well. Their avocado toast is really good with capers, deviled eggs and smoked salmon as toppings. Their salads are impressive as well.  The bar has an impressive beer list. 

Price: On the high end but yo be expected.

Service: Here is where they truly shine, everyone is extremely helpful.  We've dined here three times and each time we've always felt well taken care of. We've also had an event here which went off perfectly.

Overall: The perfect place to grab lunch or dinner after a round of golf or simply to take in the great atmosphere and service (and play some corn-hole)."}
{"text":"My first thought was, \"this is gonna be hotel food,\" but this is definitely one of those books you can't judge by the cover! 

Two particular highlights: 
1) this steak ranks in the top two, if not the top spot on our search for the Valley's best, for it's simple, beefy flavor, perfect temperature and soft, melty texture. 
2) the use of beet in the beet salad is brilliant! They are creatively disguised as ravioli casing; tucked inside: a sweet, salty mixture of locally-sourced goat cheese, candied fruit and nuts. 

The missing star is for the venue: The environment is disloyal to the kitchen. Tucked away on the property with no view to warrant its placement, dim lighting with no further romance... Marriott has a gem here that deserves the polish to shine!"}
{"text":"This place does two things very well - Steak and Service!

Everything else is pomp and circumstance for the sake of pomp and circumstance.  The appetizers, sides, desserts are very pretty but very short on actual substance.  They tasted bad and we sent them back.  The restaurant made it right by offering other items and when we passed on the opportunity they comped our ticket for the items we ordered and didn't care for so they are more than fair. But I don't go out to eat so I can send it all back - that's why I give them poor marks."}
{"text":"Weird menu, weird beer selection, and even weirder, they didn't do anything to turn this into a 19th hole where golfers would enjoy going into. Chicharrones? Scotch eggs? Really?? And nothing but CRAFT beer?? Good thing Desert Ridge is close by, with lots of normal bars!

I'm guessing Mike V works there? Because, while criticizing my so-called \"emotional\" review, and not providing a \"useful\" review, his wasn't useful at all. All he said was \"Nice beer and food selection\". Really? What is so great about a beer selection that carries none of the top selling beers in the world? What is so great about having weird food selection?"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent beer and wine selection. These other people complaining are irrational. Yelp is not a place to leave your stupid emotions about whether or not a place is closed or whether or not the former steakhouse was a restaurant you liked. This is a place for reviews that other people might find useful."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the staff are a bunch of zombies walking around with absolutely no customer service let alone personality. Out bar tender Steven acted as if he was in hell and provided a borderline unpleasant experience do to how non personable he was.  Not to pick on Steven but this was a common trend with ALL the staff.... Not sure I'll come back again.  Try smiling guys!!!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the JW for a full week and had an opportunity top go here twice.  Both times the service and the food was phenomenal.  It's a little pricy but worth every dime.

I had both a NY Strip and the prime rib.  Both were perfect.  The kale as a side dish was great too.

I recommend you make reservations, was always busy - not packed but busy.

Great wine and cocktail menu.  If it's not too hot, cool patio too.

Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!  Meritage certainly rivals the other well know steakhouses.  The food was delicious, from the appetizers to the dessert.  Everything was visually appealing as well as a culinary treat for your tastebuds.  My only complaint would be that the lighting be dimmed in the dining area. Not only was our server Suzan wonderful, but all the staff was attentive and courteous.  I look forward to be able to dine at Meritage again soon."}
{"text":"An established, upscale restaurant shouldn't have to offer groupons and other specials to generate customers! My husband and I went here for our anniversary.  The food was good.  Service was a little slow, but staff was pleasant.  For the price I would have expected amazing, but it was just ok."}
{"text":"We had happy hour here the first day we arrived on resort. The HH is 3-6 and is great! There's a very good beer selection. I had the orange blossom beer and is was soooo good. We ordered sliders and a wedge salad which were great, but the best thing was the avocado toast with salmon and other toppings you put on it yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Service equally as great as the food.   We had the trout and the sea bass which we were told were the 2 best dishes and they delivered. For sides, the grits were delicious and the pimento oil was a nice surprise. We had the mashed potatoes and brussels  sprouts too. The potatoes were great but the sprouts were just WOW! Fried, tossed with Lardo, and glazed with balsamic. 

Recommendations:
1. Make a reservation
2. Sit outside 
3. 1 side is plenty for 2 people but order more and take them to go
4. Trust your server. They are well educated on the menu
5. If your staying at the JW, go there the first night!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food was better than average, but not consistent.
I ordered the scallop appetizer. I don't remember the details but I believe it had chutney on top of each and sat a butternut squash purée, too sweet for me and did not like it. Waitress offered to replace it even though I ate the whole thing, I told her it was not necessary. (Great service)
Husband had the Caesar salad and was very happy with it.
I ordered the chicken for my main which was amazing. My husband didn't like it at all, good because it was more for me. It had mashed potatoes (or maybe it was another root veggie) but it was awesome.
Husband had 6oz Filet as his main. Ordered it medium rare and it arrived medium, which we both agree was fine. The sear was awesome and he savored every bite!
Our sides were lobster mac & cheese and scallop potatoes, both were yummy!
Desert was mint chocolate something or rather that was awesome, and I had the lemon cheesecake. Both were perfect size, they weren't monster sized, just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth and paired well with coffee.
I'll go back.
Side note. The restaurant is located in an odd spot in the back of the hotel, past the gift shops, past the vacation desk, past the ballrooms, it seemed we would never get there. Be prepared to walk a bit even from valet, if you are staying at the hotel it may be better situated from your beautiful room."}
{"text":"Went here with a number of friends who were staying at the Marriott.  It was located upstairs and a long walk down the corridor.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  Our friends had two young children with them and we feared it was not kid friendly.  They were and had high chairs.  Staff were very attentive with servers for beverages and water refills.  The menu is rather limited and a bit overpriced.  Three of us ordered the fig salad with chicken, a hamburger, meat loaf and a grilled cheese sandwich with fries for the boys.  The food order came quickly and presentation was nice.  The food was good, nothing special really.  We had a water spillage issue and staff were there to quickly clean the mess.  That is why the scoring is a bit higher.  Parking is available.  Unless you valet your car from the front of the hotel, you will have a slight walk in the heat.  The hotel itself is very pretty and located on nice grounds."}
{"text":"We had an awful experience.  Slow to get drinks and they were the wrong ones.  I ordered a burger medium rare.  Two tries got it to medium. In fairness, the roasted Brussels sprouts, fries and sea bass were excellent.  The ambiance and decor just can't be saved by an exotic name."}
{"text":"arizona restaurant week rocks because it offers affordable eats at some amazing restaurants. to take advantage of this great deal, my girl friend and i trotted off to maritage for a meal we otherwise might not spring for. 

situated at the far end of the j.w. marriott at desert ridge, maritage is a well appointed restaurant that doesn't feel uppity. the $29 pp prix fixe restaurant week menu had a lot of variety ... baked brie, french onion soup, steak, prime rib, salmon and creme brulee to name a few. overall, the quality of the ingredients seemed top notch. the amuse was absolutely delish. a few issues (temperature at serving was off for our steaks and potatoes, some portions, like the brie, were underwhelmingly small) made maritage not worthy of the 4 or 5 stars i hoped it would earn.  i'm not sure the entire experience is quite worth the regular price, but maritage was a worthy choice for restaurant week. at this point i've rambled on for too long. the bottom line: maritage is good."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went here last night for drinks and dinner. Out of all the restaurants at this hotel this one was by far the worst. The bartender was extremely rude and the 15$ drinks were terrible. While the steak was pretty good I would not recommend going here"}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses I've been to. Wife had the filet and it was cooked perfectly. I had the bone in ribeye and it was one of the most flavorful steaks I've eaten. 
We started with the cold seafood platter. Very good. Really like the vinegar shallot sauce.  The crab, shrimp, and oysters were great. 
The we had the French onion soup and wedge salad. Salad was ice cold and large enough to split. The French onion soup was one of the best I've had. The broth was amazing. 
For sides we had the baked potato and Mac &a Cheese.  Highly recommend both.
Had the Boston cream pie. The Oreo crust was amazing. Wife had the flourless chocolate cake. Very decadent and chocolaty. 
Our server, Morgan was excellent. She made great suggestions and explained menu items. 
We used a Travelzoo voucher which saved us a lot of money.  That said based on the service and the high quality of the food, we will be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times and it's hard to please me when it comes to dining. The prime rib was great and cooked to perfection. My server Dillon was very knowledgable and had great recommendations. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food

This steakhouse has wonderful food and wine.  Our server was very attentive and helpful - she was outstanding.  However, the seating hostess was very snobby - our group wanted to go there for dinner one night and when she found we did not have reservations, she rolled her eyes at us!  Not very nice..."}
{"text":"Are here for lunch while at a conference. Ordered the Root vegetable salad with hot salmon and Meritage Chopped Salad. The root vegetable salad was very tasty and the salmon added a great touch for eating protein. The chopped salad looked good and the chicken was flavorful   The burgers that were served at other tables looked very good. The reason for the three stars is because the salads were $22, way too overpriced!"}
{"text":"After finishing a round of golf at Wildfire, we came in for lunch since the restaurant had been closed for dinner since December 17th and was reopening on the 25th. I dined here several years ago for dinner and really enjoyed the dinning experience. 

My order - the 8oz sirloin steak with garlic fries and an ice cold beer. My steak was cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce and garlic fries were yummy too! 

I love the decor of the place, it's part golf theme in the bar area but the dinning area is definitely Western elegance decorated. 

I'll surely return here in the future but next time it will be for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and and great food! Our meals were reasonably priced. We were especially impressed the fixins that came with the avocado toast... dried capers, smoked salmon, egg, and more. Meritage was the perfect spot for a quick dinner after a late check-in at the hotel."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! They also have an awesome happy hour. The starters bone marrow & braised short rib, as well as the smoked pork belly is just awesome!!! The only thing I have to say bad about is that the service is slow...but the food is definitely amazing!"}
{"text":"This place presents itself as a high end steakhouse but it has all the charm of a cafeteria and the food is mediocre to bad. Really the only bright spot was the servers, who were knowledgeable and friendly without being obtrusive. But they have a lot to make up for with the atmosphere and the food. The cowhide chairs and lounge area kind of remind me of a mens' grill at a middle range country club. It's just not what it presents itself to be. It's popular with an older crowd, and it closes at 9, even on the weekends. If you're looking for a good steak in an energetic upscale atmosphere, go to Mastros, Steak 44, City Hall, Ocean Club, or the like. If you're staying at the hotel, are tired, and just want somewhere you can go with a pair of shorts on, maybe check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying a the JW for the weekend on a Travelzoo deal, and we had also purchased a Travelzoo deal for Meritage.  I think we paid $69 for a voucher for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides, and 2 desserts.  

We had a late reservation, so the place was pretty cleaned out, but that worked in our favor as we enjoyed more privacy than I think we normally would have.  The decor was cool - not modern cool, but the cowhide chairs and the high top tables fit the embiance of the steakhouse.  As others have stated, they are definitely trying to be similar to Capital Grill or Flemings with the structure of their menu and their pricing.  

We ordered the seafood platter as our appetizer to share.  It was very large and I wish we had ordered something else because it was too much food and I wasn't very hungry for dinner.  The shrimp was wonderful, as was the homemade cocktail sauce.  The lobster tail was very overcooked, but everything else was fine.

I ordered the 6 oz filet with bleu cheese butter and my husband ordered the cowboy rib eye.  Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  Were they as good as Flemings or Capital Grill?  I'm not sure about that one.  For the price we paid, they were fabulous, but if we had paid full price I'm not sure I would have been satisfied.  We had the mashed potatoes and the honey bourbon carrots as our sides and they were both WONDERFUL.  We were both very full from dinner, so we ordered some lighter desserts: the milk chocolate creme brulee and the vanilla and bourbon gelato.  They were both good, but nothing to write home about.

The service was VERY good, I have to say.  Our server, Marco, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive but not too much so.  

I would definitely return, but only if I had another coupon special like I did this time."}
{"text":"I was at the JW for a conference and a vendor dinner was held here. The ambiance was quite nice. A nice cool breeze for the night. The chairs were comfy and you kind of sink into them. I'm not sure how great that is for a dinner place - it had me feeling a bit 'low\" to the table as I'm short.

The food was very good - I had a vegan option they made and it was very tasty. Everyone that had the beef dinners raved about them. The servers were attentive w/o getting in the way of convo. 

Overall if I stayed here again I'd go back. I don't think I'd make a special trip - but it's a good option if you are at the resort."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding dinner reception at the Meritage on 4/28/18, and it was so memorable. Our cake was beautiful and the wedding guests thought it was one of the best cakes they have ever had.

Some people who really stood out to us include the following. Arthur Pottinger helped us pick out the wine and champagne, and he was wonderful to work with and very knowledgeable. Dositello Robbins, food and beverage supervisor, was phenomenal and made sure everything ran smoothly that day. Chef Dejan Djukic's food was amazing, everyone said it was the BEST filet they have had in years, and it was cooked PERFECTLY!!! The guests also loved the Chilean Sea Bass, pork chop, chicken, and appetizers. Everyone raved about the food and Crème brûlée and said everything was excellent!!! All guests were happy with their meal. 

Ashley DiDea was amazing regarding helping me plan the reception dinner and her attention to detail and excellent customer service were greatly appreciated. 

The servers that night were amazing, fast, friendly, and attentive!

Couldn't have asked for a better experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a killer deal for this restaurant from Travel Zoo. For about $90 after tip we got 2 appetizers, 2 sides, two entrees up to $35 each, two drinks, and two desserts. Wow!

The waitress was great. Starting out was Tuna Tartar and Crab Fritters. The Tuna Tartar was great, very yummy. The crab fritter appetizer was overcooked and incredibly small and came with a very large bowl of tartar sauce, still tasted OK. For our entrees we both chose the filet which came out cooked entirely wrong, they fixed the problem with no muss and came out with fresh rare filets for the both of us and apologized. The Bernaise sauce is really lousy, way too heavy on the egg and no where near enough butter. The flavor in it was very eggy and I think they just failed in adding shallots or something else to it... The horseradish sauce was creamy and delicious. The sides, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were incredibly salty and almost inedible and I love heavy salt in my food. The deserts were both fantastic and absolutely the highlight of the visit. 

For the ambience, it's very loud. Very, very loud when the restaurant is full. As for the Bartender, the first time he made my Colorado Bulldog perfectly, the next two times it was either curdled or bitter and terrible. I didn't say anything about it after they fixed the curdled drink I felt bad for the waitress! 

Overall, I think it's decent to go here if you have a deal. It's not a bad place, but it's certainly no Mortons!"}
{"text":"I arrived first, around 4:30, and waited a bit for my husband to come and meet up with me. This place is large with a concrete floor.  Not sure a golfer finishing their round would feel comfortable walking in here on their cleats to \"relax\".  

Somehow they were out of their \"handcrafted\" Bloody Mary. Our server said \"because it's made with heirloom tomato and habanero pepper\". Happy hour lasted until 6:00, so I asked why they couldn't just make me one, and the server said because they make the mix in \"a big vat\", but they were out at the moment.  So much for the exclusivity of an expensive, handcrafted cocktail that should have been available during happy hour.   

With a Bloody Mary out of reach, I ordered a glass of the only Sauvignon Blanc they had on the menu -- Nobilo.  The regular, non-Happy Hour, price should have been around $9, since that's about what you can buy an entire bottle of it for at retail, but it was $14 ( I believe the Bloody Mary would have been the same price, give or take a $1).  To add insult to injury, the Nobilo arrived via the stingiest pour I have ever experienced in a wine glass.  I drank that in a few sips and pushed it to the very edge of the table, so the server might notice I was ready for something more substantial. 

My husband arrived and the server came to take his drink order.  After my husband ordered his drink, the server turned to leave and I had to call him back and point to my empty wine glass perched on the edge of the table.  Ordered a Grey Goose martini. I figured if i was going to pay  these kind of prices for a drink, I'd better ramp up the alcohol % in order to get some value out of it.

The music that played the entire time was the most head-banging rock from the 70s that I've heard since, well,..... the 70s.  Those kind of tunes are more than fine, but better suited to a dive, pool and darts bar than what this place is trying to be.  Very odd.

Our food was just OK.   Will not return.  Too expensive for the mediocrity that it was."}
{"text":"Had lunch with group.  Great setting at golf course and can eat inside or out.  Atmosphere is heavy wood and carpet, like an old country club lounge.  Full bar with good variety of cocktails.  Lunch was quality, but a bit expensive.  I also think that they did too much to differentiate the food. Sometimes a French dip can just be a French dip and does not need fancy adders to it.  All in all ok."}
{"text":"For those of us without large extended families available to share in the joy and pain in the preparation, consumption and cleanup of an extensive Christmas dinner, dining out tends to be quite attractive despite limited menus and staff frantically keeping up with the rush who could enumerate many places they would rather be, and thus my immediate wing of the C. clan embarked on the usual attempt to find an open place.

Meritage Steakhouse, portentously enough not overrun by a Baha'i convention we discovered on Christmas in the Desert Ridge Marriott that contains it, was this year's.

Meritage is confused. It looks like it changed hands a few times and kept aspects of each - the central area looks like a sports bar with tables added, a more wooden version of a Cheesecake Factory bar, but with side areas, receded booths and the requisite outdoor tables that look more like a restaurant in its price range. A modest attempt at holiday decorations made it worse instead of providing thematic clarity.

After perusing the a la carte menu, we all opted for the $55 prix fixe family style dinner, which while ample was thankfully a lot less jumbled than the environs:

- Goat cheese arugula salad: Unremarkable.
- Squash soup: Sinfully thick and creamy, non-overpowering, and so guiltily good.
- Beef tenderloin: Tender, soft spongy meat to absorb the maitre'd sauce and the butter.
- Goose breast: Paling a bit compared with its sibling, in both taste and unhealthiness.
- Brussels sprouts with ham: Tasty, but too much butter and oil to consume en masse.
- Stuffing: Unremarkable.
- Mashed potatoes: Equally unremarkable.
- Creme Brulee: A bit on the overly creamy side, but still pleasing.
- Chocolate: Chocolate cream between chocolate wafers. Sugar high.
- Cheesecake: Diabetes, here we come!

Against fixed menu Christmas Dinner expectations, Meritage scored well, but the overall meal was too rich for my taste. Compromise candidates don't usually run this much so I'm unlikely to be back. If I did return to the Marriott for a meal, it would be for the brunch buffet at Blue Sage instead."}
{"text":"Disappointed is how I would summarize my dinner. There was one vegetarian option for an entree, the ancient grain something. The quinoa was inedible. I was careful to not get it on any part of the rest of the dish. However, the rest of the dish consisted of a few pearl onions and a smear of sweet potato (I think). 

I also ordered a margarita, which was straight tequila. I guess that's okay sometimes but I actually wanted a mixed drink."}
{"text":"I expected this place to be more expensive than out usual steakhouse, and I wasn't disappointed.  Overpriced for what we got, totally so. Service was mediocre, though the waitress did write the name of my wine for me on a business card so I could find a bottle later. We saw nothing in the entrees that was appealing enough for the price, so we had French Onion soup, outstanding, and shared a baked mac n cheese with lobster ($18!!!!!) which was ridiculously small.  Bread served was a bland sourdough, with tasteless butter, should be salted, and per waitress it is a Vermont cheddar butter.....no cheddar detected by us. My wine, Sivas Sonoma, was the only shining star, excellent for the 9$.  Recommend you take you money to Ruth's Chris instead, or at least make reservations so they seat you in the dining room and not the bar."}
{"text":"A group of us (12 adults) were staying at the JW and wanted to have a nice dinner.  I spoke to Aaron Lee (group dining coordinator) and he set up the reservation at the Meritage.  They don't have a private room so we got a corner table.  I had preordered 2 seafood platters, calamari/shrimp , and sweet potato fries.  We arrived and was promptly escorted to our table.  At 8pm on a Tuesday night, they dining room was only at approx 40% capacity.  We were immediately served water and cocktail orders were taken.  Cocktails were a tad pricey at $15.  I tried one of their signature cocktails (pomegranate and whiskey concoction) and thought it was good, just not $15 good.  We ordered some white and red wines as well (fair selection).  The seafood platter was nice.  Oysters were decent.  You have to ask for the drawn butter if you want it with your crab legs and lobster.  I thought that made it better.  People said the calamari and shrimp was over seasoned and I would have to agree.  Fries were just fries.  For my entree, i opted for the prime rib (medium rare) and the rest ordered the rib eye.  I thought my prime rib was cooked perfectly.  I liked the smokiness that was hyped up.  The entrees didn't come with any sides.  We ordered the cream of spinach, mash potatoes, and mushrooms.  The sides were just ok.  I still would prefer Lawry's prime rib and their sides over this.  The rib eyes were good.  We had some issues with the temperature of the rare and medium rare.  The waitress initially came out and made it seem as if we were wrong (\"when you see it in better lighting, you would see that it was cooked properly) but sent it back.  I mentioned to her that rareness is judge not only on color but temperature.  And the steak she brought out was too warm to be called rare.  The chef came out himself to apologize and made sure the new ones were cooked well (and they were).  He also sent out some extra sides.  
From that point on, service was great.  Actually it was great throughout.  We ordered a couple of the desserts. The banana cream pie was awesome but the creme brulee (chocolate) was just ok.  
My last complaint was that we had a package with the hotel and was suppose to receive free appitizers and desserts.  I thought the group coordinator would pass this along to the restaurant.  We never got the freebies.  And when I wrote the coordinator about it, I did not get a respone...
All in all, this pace was decent and deserves a 3.5 star rating.  It doesn't really stand up to the Flemings, Maestros, or the other high end steakhouse.  But for being on the resort property, not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Last night of a work meeting at the JW and we stopped here with the team.  Nice atmosphere and solid service.

We chose a plethora of apps that included oysters, crab, lobster.. and who can resist lobster mac 'n cheese?  I always feel funny eating east coast oysters so far west.  They were OK but I would have prefered to see some west coast varieties on the menu.

I went with a filet for my entree and it was outstanding.  Perfectly prepared and properly rested before being presented.  It was a melt in your mouth food fest!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding meal here.  We both had the Cesar Salad which was very crisp and fresh.  I also had the French Onion Soup which was as good as any I have had.  For the main course we both had the Prime Rib, it was superb.  The value for the money spent was good.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, and stopped by for eats. Food was good, but we really enjoyed our server, Louise. Really personable, outgoing and friendly. Not what were used to in LA...better!!:)). 

Update: 11/26/14. After leaving my first review, the manager responded with a very friendly message and encouraging words that will definitely keep me returning to this awesome establishment."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience way beyond expectations. Rolled in with a 20 person party and they accommodated us with grace and ease. The fillet was better than other steak houses which I've frequented of late and get this wine lovers - they had Peter Michael - and it was reasonably priced. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a group of at least 30. Most of us (couples) had resort credit. First they told us they couldn't accommodate the separate bills until we complained. Two patrons NEVER got their meal. Crap. Py.. Some people paid before others got their food. L.A.M.E."}
{"text":"I was staying at the JW Marriott over the summer, so ate dinner here. I was pleasantly surprised. My steak was cooked & seasoned perfectly, and mussels were very good. Service was fine, and with the Groupon, the cost was very reasonable. Will definitely go back if I stay here again."}
{"text":"First, service was amazing! Second, such a cute place we didn't even know it was there..way around in the back by the golf course. We got a groupon and had the chips and dip, which was so yummy. I had the avocado toast with salmon and a whole create your own style basically. You could add what you wanted from the little dishes it came with. My husband had a great burger and yummy fries. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My overall experience was amazing thanks to my server Dillon. He was very knowledgeable of the wines, and everything that he recommended was amazing! I would recommend eating here and make sure to request him as your server."}
{"text":"Brought my husband here for Father's Day brunch and quickly discovered they only prepare and serve steak at dinner. They did verbally offer one cut for lunch, after I inquired, and while it was okay, we were stunned that the venue refers to itself as a steakhouse yet, only serves it for dinner."}
{"text":"We were staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge so decided to try lunch here. M y husband had been here before and couldn't stop raving about the lobster roll which is only offered at lunch.

The lobster roll is pricey at $19 but it is worth it! PACKED with fresh lobster light on the dressing with wonderful flavour. Highly recommend you try this.

My younger son had the turkey Reuben sandwich which was delicious and not greasy as some Reuben sandwiches tend to be. My older son had the prime rib sandwich which was also fantastic. 

The fries and sweet potato fries were also done perfectly.

The food is great here! Check it out!"}
{"text":"First experience -- amazing lobster roll for lunch!  Brioche bun fresh and perfect buttered and crisp, tons of lobster salad with celery and just right amount of mayo.  4 Stars!   Second experience -- dinner.  First, they said we could not use credit card because their system was not working.  Other funky issues, such as this.  Ordered the filet mignon medium well.  Server asked if okay to butterfly it and I said, \"sure\".  When steak showed up, it was well-done to almost burned, completely dried out and my kids could have done a better job cooking it.  Mashed potatoes good, but far too rich for my tastes.  Server did a good job of getting us out within our tight time constraints but food was lacking, especially since they are a \"steak house\"  Salad was good though.  Third experience - back for lobster roll for lunch.  Dang it, roll was sloppily presented, not buttered and grilled correctly and they was a \"hunk\"of bread hanging off side.  Lobster had so much mayo that it nearly ruined it.  Didn't send back since I had to catch a flight.  No consistency here.  Sorry to give them a 2 rating.  It is clear they use quality ingredients, but the execution is lacking."}
{"text":"I met a client at the JW Marriot for lunch, and we ate at the Meritage Steakhouse since not much else is open for lunch. Big disappointment. It looks like a mediocre resort restaurant - I expected more. 

Service: We got there at about 11:20, it was empty and we were seated quickly. The waiter came over and took our drink orders fairly quickly. However he dropped the sugar container on the floor between 2 diners, and never picked it up the entire meal.  We ordered and the food came fairly soon...but when the waiter served it he handed off some dishes to us mid-air, rather than putting it on the table. Just seemed odd, as he could have reached to put it on the table...and it was hot soup! He didn't smile much and was not very friendly or helpful throughout the meal. 

When asked by my client if there was anything he recommended on the menu (since he hadn't said anything when he came up to take our orders), he sort of shrugged and finally said, \" it depends on what you feel like, something light and healthy or greasy and rich\" Then he said he liked the French Dip Sandwich best.  I honestly don't think the guy ever said, \"Enjoy your meal!\"

Food: I had the \"large\" Meritage Salad & Onion soup: The onion soup was overly sweet with a thin layer of cheese on top. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it and I think I found one little piece...and the salad was small, and really not very flavorful. My client had the Lobster Bisque & Crab Cakes: the soup had a nice flavor, but no chunks of lobster at all. She enjoyed the crab cake...there was only one. Servings were generally somewhat scant. My coworker had the Turkey Sandwich: Looked like the pressed \"deli\" turkey you get at the supermarket....she ended up eating about half the sandwich and left most of the fruit side dish that looked like the pre-cut up fruit you buy at the store. Another coworker had the French Dip sandwich: She enjoyed it and the big onion rings that came with it.

Overall, the meal was mediocre. Possibly their dinners, steaks, etc. are better....but after that kind of lunch, I'd never go back to try it...and I'd be willing to bet they are not."}
{"text":"Meritage was delicious. I had a 6oz filet. It was good. The table split Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese, and potatoes. I really liked the Mac and cheese. Everyone at the table liked the potatoes. The Brussels sprouts were split. I personally have had better. There was someone at my table who doesn't like brussel sprouts but did like these."}
{"text":"Food was meh and a bit expensive. That said, this is to be expected in any big hotel restaurant imo.

That said, the service and experience as a lone traveller was amazing. It's a great bar and I was able to watch the games."}
{"text":"Located inside the JW Marriott, Meritage is a decent option if you don't want to leave the resort. The food was good, but nothing memorable, especially for the prices. The service was friendly and attentive. The back patio is really nice for sitting back and catching up with friends while enjoying a meal or a few drinks (they have a large selection beer cans and bottles) but I don't think I'd come back if I weren't staying at the hotel. There is a Groupon out there right now which might make this place worthwhile though."}
{"text":"Had a terrific dinner last night at Meetings. My lamb loin was perfect. My wife's filet was equally good. Sides were very good and service was quick and professional. Not inexpensive but the meal was top notch"}
{"text":"Last night, my family and I came to this restaurant and ran into an issue. We left, I wrote a review to share my experience and didn't think much until a gentleman came to find us at the pool today and invited us back, his name is Arthur the restaurant manager. We were impressed by the gesture, this gentleman walked to the pool to find us in the over 100 degree weather to invite us for dinner tonight.  am glad we decided to return. I am updating my review based on our experience tonight. I feel that is something that often folks don't take the time to do in our society in the age of social media which is filled with negative criticism. 
We had a great experience tonight. It started with a warm greeting from the same gentleman Arthur, we were seated in a very spacious booth and greeted by our server who was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. She took our drinks order, and returned with it very quickly. Shortly after, Arthur returned with the very creative Chef, Dejan Djuckic who presented us with a tasty and perfectly presented appetizer. 
We placed our order, and embarked on a journey. We experienced something new, a truly fine meal. We began with the salad and avocado toast, the ingredients were perfectly balanced which awakened our palate. The main course, was made with fresh and top notch ingredients. Our Prime NY steak was a fine piece of meat raised in a reputable ranch. It was cooked perfectly, and paired with their delicious mashed potatoes and savory vegetables. Our second entrée was the Chilean sea bass, a treat. It was cooked perfectly, and paired with the most flavorful Brussel sprouts. Upon completing our meal, we were served the most delightful, visually stimulating and tasty dessert- a dark chocolate brownie was baked perfectly and the components were balanced and complemented each other. 

People are often unkind to members of the service industry, our experience this evening has surpassed any expectations we had. The meal, service, and experience have left us wanting more. My wife and I have traveled extensively and dined in many restaurants and in my opinion the skillful chef at Meritage is one of the finest cooks in Phoenix. We will be returning very soon, hungry for more. Thank you for your efforts to provide us this amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"A nice gastropub type restaurant. Food and service was great, as were the drinks. All-around nice experience."}
{"text":"1 star for their hand-crafted cocktail experience.  2.5 for the food.  Food was fine--not great, not special, but fine.

When you say \"Hand-Crafted\" cocktails, it means something.  It includes a quality spirit, maybe a splash of bitters, a little simple syrup, maybe a little citrus, maybe shaken, maybe stirred and likely garnished.  This place claims to be hand crafted, but it is not.  We frequently stay at this resort (quarterly) and was excited to try it out.

I ordered an old fashioned and it was an old fashioned old fashioned, meaning the bartender had to go to the back room to get 2 sugar packets, when the simple syrup was 1 foot away.  There was maraschino cherry and orange muddling, with loose ice chips.  1.5 OZ of Buffalo Trace for $20.  Ridiculous, especially when I was enjoying Tito's cocktails, pool-side for half the price.

My wife ordered a drink from their \"Chili's Style\" cardboard drink menu.  The bartender had no idea what it was, had to take the drink menu and open it to the right page to make the drink that came out nothing as advertised.  I'm OK paying $20 for a quality cocktail, but this was not.

We found out later that we were there during happy hour.  We ordered our drinks 15 minutes before the end, but was still charged full price.  \"Specialty Cocktails\" were half price.  

Over charged and underwhelmed.  May try the food again, will not come for the drinks."}
{"text":"Conveniently located within the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort.  So hopeful when I walked into the joint, because it was quite pleasing to the eyes, but not so much for the taste buds... sad face.

Food: My friend and I did go around drunch (between lunch and dinner) time, so we experienced their happy hour menu.  Not a bad selection for happy hour.  Let's start with my favorite dish, the Season's Harvest Pickled Vegetables.  My friend's choice, did not sound so appetizing, but boy was I wrong.  The veggies were pickled to perfection.  You can tell that each veggie was pickled in a different brine, because you get a different experience, whether it be sweet, tart, spicy, or smokey with each crunchy bite.  Did I mention crunchy, how are these veggies so so so so crunchy after that pickling.  Overall amazing.  

Next we had the corn frites, would def not recommend this dish.  It was extremely salty... extremely salty.  Fried to perfection, but don't think it is something that I would get again.  

Moving on to the fish and chips.  The fish was very light, flaky, and moist.  I think the batter could have used a bit of seasoning, slightly on the bland side.  It came with a caper remoulade, which could have used a bit more flavor as well.  It was just missing a pinch of something.

Grand finale was the apple crisp.  Nice and crispy caramelized filo.  Had a nice cinnamon-sugar flavor.  We broke it apart and ate it with the tart apples.  Would have been nice if the apples were cooked down a little more, so they could be nice and soft.  Slightly too tart for me.  So if you have a sweet tooth post meal, this may not be the dessert for you.

Service: I'm pretty sure at any other time of day there is a hostess, but not during drunch.  We walked in and was greeted by .... nothing.  Now we stood in a bit of confusion.  So then after a good minute of looking and being awkward, I asked the bartender if we should seat ourselves.  Answer was yes.  After that, it was smooth sailing.  Our waitress was prompt with keeping drinks full, clearing away dishes, providing information about the menu, and had such a welcoming smile.
  
Ambiance: casual, urban/rustic.  The interior of this place had a restoration hardware kind of feel, which I absolutely love.  Very laid back, get your day drink on kind of atmosphere.

Dranks: Had some decent beer selections on draft, including some local beers.  Make sure to ask if they have the beer you want prior to getting all excited.  Just because it is on the list, does not mean they will always have it available.  Pretty good wine by glass option.  If all else fails, full bar baby.

Overall: Loved the atmosphere.  A place where you can just kick back, grab a couple of drinks, and relax.  Not a huge palate pleaser when it comes to their dishes, but def a good place to grab a few drinks, and chat it up with friends.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great option on campus at the JW.  Food was great and atmosphere very cool. Try the strip steak. Probably more adult than kid friendly."}
{"text":"Service feels a bit slow. The waitresses are good, but I suspect the kitchen is understaffed. I'm not sure; either way, the restaurant is not even half full. 

In their defense, we did have a party of 15+.

Spinach and artichoke dip was not quite what I expected. I did not enjoy the flavor at all. The guyere cheese is so strong that it destroys the flavor of everything else in the dip and just tastes like a cheese sauce. This might be the most unhealthy tasting spinach dip I've ever had in my life. The flatbread went fine with it, but the mushy oven crackers did not. 

Appetizer with the mussels was okay. They didn't really do anything with it. 

Bread rolls were generic ones that you could buy from any grocery store and were not soft or warm, the way I like them. For some reason, they served them after most people were done with their entrees, which makes zero sense. Did they forget to bring them out earlier? 

Most of the portions are pretty small. For the most part, the level of quality doesn't justify the cost. This place is fake classy/fancy: dress up your mediocre food with expensive decorations, European-ish names, a wine list, and more effort in plating. 

Case in point, my scallops entree was just 4 big scallops with condiments. Granted, that's not super unusual, but they did virtually nothing to enhance its umami and almost every bite had sand in it. If I didn't know better, I might guess that sand was the main ingredient in their recipe."}
