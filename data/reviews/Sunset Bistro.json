{"text":"The food is good here.  However, there's no restroom inside the restaurant.  You have to go out in the heat to a filthy mall restroom which is not air conditioned.  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Great Greek Food.  Very friendly service.  Had the greek combo plate.  Greek salad, falapel, dolomithes, and hummus. Went for linch.  Good portion size, and i am a relatively big eater.  Nice patio out front"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a sandwich and we found a great community hang out. The food was great the poor waitress was moving at top speed.  Before we finished our meal the karaoke was moving along non stop with everyone enjoying the food and fun. 
 The next time we stopped was for lunch I tried a philly cheese steak sandwich. It was great!
We are totally satisfied.

{"text":"We're regular diners at the Sunset Bistro. Ample portions are always value-priced. Daily specials are unique and tasty. Service is solid and accurate, servers very knowledgeable about the food and specials. They don't seem to push alcohol. Dinner salad is largest I've seen with a variety of fixings, and their Chicago Dog is the best west of Chicago. Small restaurant with an outdoor smoking/dining/drinking area.  Sincerely, Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ."}
{"text":"I love this place! We always grab some good to go when in Sun City! Great food and staff."}
{"text":"Great little Greek Bistro in the heart of Sun City. Both the Greek salad with gyro meat and the chicken gyro were excellent. Great, friendly service!! Will definitely be going back! The Greek appetizer was also very good, a little sampling of everything. The dolmas were perfect!!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for gyros so we wound up at the Sunset Bistro. We sat outside even though it was over 90. They added some shades so the sun wasn't directly in our eyes. Very comfortable. I decided to have a falafel sandwich which was delicious! Crispy falafel on a really fresh pita. Fresh lettuce tomato and onion. My friend had the burger which was really good too. The waitresses were really nice and attentive. It was a good place for a quick bite at a reasonable price. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant in Greenway shopping area.  Greek salad tasted fresh.  Pita bread was warm and very good.  Gyros meat was tender and seasoned nicely."}
{"text":"We were highly recommended to try this place, but our experience was very much less than satisfacory. Our waitress literally argued with us and still messed up the simplest of things. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall,  a bad experience and we WILL NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I'm usually driving through sun city and I happened to stop by Sunset Bistro and oh man I'm so happy I stopped here. The food is amazing, the service was on point. Very nice employees and very respectful. I at least stop by 3-4 times a week. Amazing selection. If you have a chance. Stop by you'll love it"}
{"text":"The gyros brings me back to Chicago Greek town. All meals are large, service is great and fast. One of my top spots."}
{"text":"This is the best keep secret in Sun City,  There wed and fri fish fry, be it one serving, is the best anywhere and very very well prices. The one regular waitress is amazing, I have been there when the lace is almost full, with a full service bar and a patio, and she never misses a beat.  There gyros are spectacular and try the Curry chicken soup, to die for. If you give it a try I guarantee, like me you will be back many times."}
{"text":"Very sweet restaurant, fairly small. We take up almost half the place when we get a table for 8, but there is a patio area. I've been here a handful of times and have had no complaints. I've got their Chicken Kabob plate and their Italian Spaghetti I would recommend them to anyone. I think all the entrees come with soup or salads. The Greek salad is definitely the one I recommend the Vinegarette they use is delicious. I have not tried any dessert yet but only because they are anything but stingy with their portions.. I always am left very full and satisfied. . . Then we always stick around for karaoke 7 to 11 on Saturday nights.. there are some very talented people that show off their vocals here. Don't miss out!
FYI: The restaurant  does not have a restroom so you'll have to take a little walk outside by Little Italy. Not too far at all"}
{"text":"This was delish!! Big portion for the price, and very accommodating for my allergies! Ordered chicken kabob, and a gyro. Both were moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise indeed: a Middle Eastern restaurant tucked away in the Greenway shopping plaza in Sun City, Arizona. From fresh Greek salads, to chicken kebabs served over perfectly cooked basmati rice, to yummy garlicky gyros this place has some really good grub (as well as healthy) in the food desert that is Sun City. An added bonus, the owner and the server/bartender were very welcoming."}
{"text":"Been there few times. The food is good, I love there greek salad. They have chicken kabob, which is not considered Greek actually, it is middle eastern.
The place is great, it need just a little more cleaning."}
