{"text":"We had a vow renewal at our house.  Short leash cme for the night!  Not one unhappy diner the whole night and we had 198 people!  Such great guys working it and the owner is AMAZING!  highly recommend!  P.s.  i didnt even get to try it we were so busy socializing!"}
{"text":"Last week, my wife were in Austin for an event over the weekend.  We walked around downtown and ran into a couple of food trucks.  We had a po'boy that was out of this world. Thought what a great idea...food trucks.  Low overhead for the owner, great food, cool dining experience with a local chef with the passion to serve great and unique food!  Now, a week later, back in Phoenix...  I am getting out of a meeting with my stomach grumbling and trying to figure what to eat.  So I hop in my car and now talking to my wife and asking where I can grab something that I have not tried in the downtown area...  She says \"...do not know...\". Then I see the food trucks!  I say to myself \"you have to stop, these are local entrepreneurs that deserve at least a shot!\".    Boy... Was I blown away!  I had a hard choice to make between the various food trucks...  I chose Short Leash. I was going to order the the Chicago-style dog. Because, if you knew my wife's family, anything else would be blasphemy!    I asked the recommendation of the owner between the Chicago-style and something else on the menu.  He recommended the Aiko that had mango chutney and jalepenos.  I took his advice!   He then called my name when the dog was ready...  Sat down... Unwrapped it... And was blown away with the presentation, the flat bread, the whole combination!  They even had the \"Mexican\" coca cola made with cane sugar.   Needless to say, I was blown away! Now, I have to take my wife there, probably kicking and screaming because she is a traditionist when it comes to hot dogs.  But I know she will love it!  BTW, they have a FB page with locations and times where they are at, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dear Foodies,  Normally when I write reviews they are about the alcohol and food that I enjoy at the establishment. However, this time around I only enjoyed the delectable cans of beer here at Short Leash because we ate elsewhere before stumbling over to this place during First Friday.   I had the Coconut Porter in a can and it blew my hair back. I also tried a yummy Pilsner that they have in a can as well. Their beers on tap or not that adventurous or exciting to me so I opted for can and was very happy. I will return to eat the food there; it smelled and looked amazing as the servers walked the food to the tables behind me."}
{"text":"This hot dog place is AMAZING!! I go to the one in the Union ( in the Biltmore Plaza ). I always get the pretzel dog and it is so good! They have amazing hot dogs. I don't like regular hot dogs, but when I went to this place for the first time, i fell in love! I have been here now a few times, and every time I saw satisfied! I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have followed these guys from when Sit-Stay was the weekend parking spot at Camelback and Central. They rocked then and have only gotten better! The fried green tomatoes stack will change your life. This is not your Dad's dog joint. Think haute cuisine in a Naan wrapper. The Bear is what you try first. I mean it, the peanut butter, bbq sauce, and cracker jacks totally meld into heaven in your mouth. They have beer floats also, I know, BEER floats. And now with Rollover Donuts; I should live here! These folks are so cool also. This is what Phoenix is supposed to taste like. Great local food, without the pretentious attitude. Go now, get up! Your palate will tongue kiss you for it."}
{"text":"It's all about the topping (and a huge choice there is), the bread, and the owners! Dogs could be big, but they tastes are big enough. Worst part is everyone discovering how great they are...long lines!"}
{"text":"Totally impressive! The owners are so amazing and sweet (they even remembered my name as a repeat customer!) I'm absolutely head-over-heels in love with their fried pickles (sweet and savory and crunchy) and the corn pups are delish. I love the beer hot spicy dogs and the variety of toppings. Support a great local business!"}
{"text":"Moki.  Hold the onion.  Beer Hot sausage.  Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"hard to find because it's a stand OFF central avenue. but plenty of street and lot parking once you get there. this review is easy: BEST DONUTS IN THE CITY. look at all of the pictures here on Yelp. yep, they taste just as good. small selection so gets there early, birdy."}
{"text":"Great place! Lots of unique donuts, fantastic staff, and a huge selection of coffees. Plus, you're supporting a local business. I'll be back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their hot dog creations. They have very different and unique flavor combination and they are served on naan like flat bread, not the same old hot dog bun.  My personal favs are the Aiko and the Moki. All hot dogs cost $5 which i'm willing to pay for these tasty puppies!"}
{"text":"So good it makes you want to raise a dog of your own just to have the off chance of having it named after a new featured dog of the week recipe. I had one of their dogs for lunch the drove across to valley to have another for dinner. Calling these culinary concoctions gourmet doesn't begin to describe the goodness found in every single bite."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot dogs with so many options it's unbelievable.  The Shreiners dogs are really worth it.  I'd rank this down for them staying mostly in Central Phx, but I really can't fault them for that."}
{"text":"AMAZING doughnuts! all flavors are to die for! Too bad they closed the cafe on W Vernon (hence 4 stars only), it was so charming and tranquil. The downtown place is not as nice. Wish they would come back."}
{"text":"These are the nicest people you'll ever meet and they sell amazing hot dogs. I especially like the Igby: coleslaw, BBQ sauce and blue cheese. You can order off the list or choose your own combination of toppings, and you can even get a combo named after your dog. Veggie dogs are available for the non-carnivore crowd. A must-try if you're in Phoenix; find them Wednesday evenings and Friday lunchtimes outside the Phoenix Public Market downtown."}
{"text":"Man what can i say about short leash dogs other than simply amazing . . . now that i think about it that pretty much sums up short leash. The first time i had their dogs was at my graduation party, my parents said that their hot dogs were absolutely amazing and they weren't wrong."}
{"text":"I saw the Yelp top 100 review and I quickly scanned the list to see if my city placed. Short Leash was number 81 in the country! I logged it in the back of my mind until today. My coworkers took me to a Food Truck Gathering, The smallest truck had the longest line. It was the fabled short leash. I took some suggestions in the line and I got a Spicy Beer Dog on the \"Lady\" set up. I also splurged on the fried pickles and a bottled water. 10 dollars even steven. For a 10 dollar bill that lunch was a SOLID home run. In the 10 buck range I can't picture you doing much better for flavor AND satisfaction.   Looking forward to the next time I stumble across this lovely truck."}
{"text":"Bad coffee (non-flavored. I'm sure the iced vanilla lattes are great.), great donuts. The staff were quick and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best food truck places you will find. Been getting crazy dog for about years and will never go any where else."}
{"text":"Love their dogs! Very interesting combination. A coworker took me there on a Friday while attending a convection. Soooo good."}
{"text":"AMAZING HOT DOGS! Couldn't believe how great the veggie dogs were! (That's right, were, those are past tense, so yummy!) One of the best food trucks out there. Not to be missed, and affordable too!"}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet hotdogs! I get the Bear on a veggie dog. Ingredients sound strange together (peanut butter, bbq sauce, cracker jacks, Gouda... and I add fried pickles), but it tastes like heaven."}
{"text":"I've visited the Short Leash truck several times now, and I have to help spread my love for this place.  I love this place!!      First off, the customer service is top notch.  Sometimes you have to wait a while to get your food, but that's what happens when there's a line and clearly the kitchen is tiny.  It's in a trailer!  Even when the line has been long, I've always been treated warmly and felt appreciated, which I think is charming.  Some eating establishments are more focused on turnover than character, and I think the opposite is true here.  Once I showed up when they were closed (or just about to be, at least) and they still took the time to churn out a hot dog for me!  My favorite variety so far has been the Igby (cole slaw, blue cheese, and barbecue sauce.)  The naan used instead of a bun really helps hold all the toppings in place, and it's less crumbly tasting than a regular hot dog bun.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I just don't like sausage casing. Fortunately, the veggie dog used at Short Leash tastes just like an actual dog but without that gross crunchy texture.  Awesome!    If you're a Facebook fan, you can get updates of all their fantastic sounding weekly specials and cute pictures of the dogs they're named after.  Great food, excellent service, Short Leash Dogs definitely has me on a... SHORT LEASH!  (Couldn't resist.)"}
{"text":"I too work on a food truck - The American Poutine Co. - and worked a lunch with these guys a few weeks back.  They have KILLER customization options. You start with your type of dog and go from there. They had pre-made specialty combinations, or you could add your own personal toppings from their EXTENSIVE list of options.  I went with a spicy dog, sauerkraut, and mustard. Simple yet elegant, and these guys NAILED it.  Working on a food truck - no matter how GREAT your food is - it becomes boring. So we trade food with other trucks.  Let me just say this: I'm looking forward to seeing them again and getting a delicious hot dog - you should too.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this. I mean the trailer is sooo cute, and the food truck idea I am crazy about, but the soggy flat bread wasn't what I expected. I am willing to give it another try, and if I change my mind, I will recant!!!"}
{"text":"Short Leash catered my circus themed wedding reception back in April. My husband and I could not have been happier with the quality of delicious food and their exemplary customer service.  We had 150 guests. Everyone received their individual order in a timely manner. The whole menu was available which meant that our guests with dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free, etc.) were taken care of as well. My father in-law was INSTANTLY obsessed and ate at least four hot dogs. Our guests could not get enough. We originally looked at caterers that would have cost a minimum of $50 per person. Short Leash ended up costing about $10 a meal. You can't beat that. If we ever do another large scale party, we will definitely be giving Short Leash a call."}
{"text":"Super tasty joint paired with mega tasty beers. The location is key and right down the street from me.  No parking, which I could care less about being solely a cyclist. I love dining on the patio while watching the city do its thing as the sun sets.  If you're a health nut, this is your cheat day location.  I highly suggest the bbq monstrosity, mouthwatering.  no really my mouth is watering just visualizing that steaming wiener."}
{"text":"Back from Phoenix, and still can't stop thinking of \"The Bear\"!   Once you get past the novelty of the peanut butter and the crackerjack, the trio of the smoked gouda, bacon, and bbq sauce make an incredible topping!   I had my dog sliced up and with no \"bun\", so each piece was just smothered in all that lovely mess, where the dog (nitrate free btw!) had enough delicious flavor to stand out as well!  Just heaven!"}
{"text":"One word: delicious.  Quick, friendly service, clean looking truck and for a hot dog stand an extensive menu. They offer all their selections with a vegetarian dog, which I love! I had the special of the day, it was fresh and hot, served on soft warm flat bread that tasted like it was baked that morning.  I know they travel around the valley, the best location for me to catch them is the Urban Market downtown - they are there Saturday mornings, Wednesday evenings, and for lunch on Fridays.  Will be back this evening for round two!"}
{"text":"The food never disappoints. We have eaten at both the food truck and their new restaurant Sit Stay in Downtown. They even catered an event for my company. Over 75 perfect hotdogs and satisfied guests! The service is a consistent A+ and the food speaks for itself. Great work everyone."}
{"text":"After hearing nothing but good things about Short Leash Dogs, I finally got to try them out for lunch yesterday. Every Wednesday during June & July (I think?) they are located at 335 W McDowell Rd (which is about a 2 minute drive from where I work) from 11am-1:30pm. My girlfriend Renee is in town for the summer so she met me there for some lunch & girl talk. We were warmly greeted by Brad (1 of the owners) & he explained it all since this was our 1st time. I decided on the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions & fried pickles) with a regular wiener, a bottle of good old fashioned coke & a corn pup for us to share. Renee decided on the weekly special Tyler (beef & bean chili, French's crunchy fried onions & cheddar cheese, sans the fried onions) with a regular wiener & a bottle of coke as well. We loved our wieners & the corn pup, so damn good! I loved that they used Naan bread instead of a bun, so clever! My only complaint was that I wished they used dill pickles on my wiener instead of the sweet ones. It was also a cute touch that they give you a lil dum dum sucker, brings me back to my childhood days. Total for 2 wieners, a corn pup & 2 bottled cokes was only $16 & some change, awesome deal. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came out here for the first time. Staff was very friendly. I got the lady dog and my fiancé got the macdaddy. Both of them were very flavorful. The naan that wraps the dog was just the right texture (not too crispy not too soggy). Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Short Leash Dogs food trucks since...well...forever.  I just realized I never wrote a review.  LOVE LOVE LOVE their dogs.  Who could ever imagine that mango, cilantro, mayonnaise, jalapenos and a hot dog, served on nan bread, would ever go together?  I'm so thankful that Brad and Kat did, because that concoction is one little slice of heavenly dog.      I actually hired Short Leash to cater a party I had at my house for 70 people and it was the talk of all my friends for months after.   I'm pretty certain that Short Leash saw an increase in visitor's the month after my party from all the guest that were introduced to their marvelous food :)  And, I'll tell you what, the price point was so reasonable (never mind the benefit I gained of not having to cook and clean up).  Brad and Kat are great people who care about the community and support the local-organic trend that is sweeping the nation.   Go catch them for dinner on Wednesday evenings (along with other food trucks) down at the Phoenix Public Market, or at Food Truck Friday's same locale.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS FREAKIN' TRUCK?  I am already being seduced by the sweet glamor food @ Urban Cookies.  On a regular, ordinary Tuesday afternoon I stumble upon a truck. \"What is this?\" my curiosity begs. Answer: THE FINEST HOT DOGS IN ALL OF PHOENIX.  Now I know what you're thinking. \"Anna, what about Ted's?\" Well, what about it? it's a classic joint that has been keeping Valley residents hot dog happy for three decades. I love Ted's and I always will. However, what Short Leash is doing is groundbreaking hot dog architecture (Short Leash, Inc. may use that quote ---- but I want free hot dogs). Tasty, tastier, tastiest. SHORT LEASH, you've got me on your leash for all time."}
{"text":"Most delicious donuts in Phoenix and the coffee is just as good! Great Saturday/Sunday morning activity. Their maple donut was excellent and the batter itself was top notch! This will be a regular spot for me and my friends/family!"}
{"text":"I like this place an will be going again. But there is more hype than quality. The 'pitchers' are tiny and the food is good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My wife got the Mac Daddy, daughter got the Bear, and I got the bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel.  Crazy cool flavor combinations and a foodies dream.  Bring your hipster friends too.  They'll dig the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love these guys great food, not your everyday hot dog.. Unique topping making it more of a gourmet meal.. Not to mention they are wonderfully nice.. Some of the pictures don't do the dogs justice."}
{"text":"Short Leash Dogs is obviously a front runner in the relatively small but beautifully thriving food truck scene in Phoenix.  Their truck had one of the longest lines today (Food Truck Friday @ Phx Public Market), and since I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try Cajun, I went for the dogs.  The Igby dog I gleefully munched was spot on - the acidity and fresh crunch of the coleslaw balanced well with the richness of the blue cheese and the sweet tang of the BBQ sauce.   It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.  It was a satisfying meal and not too expensive for the quality delivered.  Their menu is well-rounded, always important for a food truck since the menu needs to be small.  With five combinations of toppings, all with wildly differing flavor profiles, six choices of dog, plus the build-your-own option, there is something for everyone.  Their meat dogs are from Schreiner's, so you're golden with any choice you make there, and there is a veg option, as well, which I will never, ever be commenting on.  They also have a special of the day dog, which you'll have to arrive early for, since the devotees generally gobble them up.  And more power to them - the special I saw on the board looked amazing, and I was sorry I had missed it, having arrived an hour and a half into service.  The only reason I am daring to knock a star off this rating is that there is one tiny thing that needles me: the bread they use.  Don't get me wrong, the flatbread is delicious, inventive, and conducive to a not-too-messy eating experience.  It's a crucial part of their style of hot dog, and Short Leash's followers are nuts about it.  But...for me, I felt that they have a slight packaged quality to them that reminds me of Trader Joe's, which is not a horrible by any means, but it leaves me craving something more....  I can't help but wish they would add just one more option of bread/bun - in my opinion, a pretzel bun would make a killer addition.  Short Leash Dogs is a gem in the food truck scene and is absolutely not to be missed by local foodies.  I'm looking forward to trying all of their combinations in the years to come."}
{"text":"Oh, it's so easy to love Short Leash. The staff are super friendly and nice and the dogs are just fantastic. This food truck (and soon to be walk-in restaurant!) serves hot dogs, sausages and brats from Schreiner's, a local place, and they are always delicious. Each unique hot dog I've tried so far - the Oliver and the Aiko - are yummy and fresh. The super soft naan \"bun\" is great compliment to the dogs. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this little shop out for National Doughnut day!! Man oh man, it did NOT disappoint!! We were planning on getting two doughnuts, but ended up getting 6 because of the amazing flavor combinations. My hands down favorite was the pistachio lemon! My husband favored the maple bacon- he said it was the best maple bacon doughnut he's ever had! We also tried their coconut chai (yummmm), the flavor of the month that was a coconut/pineapple flavor, chocolate/walnut and the \"bear\" which was a savory doughnut with Gouda! Best. Doughnuts. Ever."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a food fanatic. I like to try hotdogs when I travel and try to find interesting experiences. This is one of those. It's classy and fun. Nice staff, good vibes and chill music. I rarely found a place where everything fits in like here. Try it! You won they do! Enjoy! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"High quality, local ingredients, $5!!    This will keep me coming back to Phx Public Market every Friday!"}
{"text":"Being six months preggos, and on the search for the perfect hot dog, I took advice from Jan, the owner of Sweet Republic, and tried the corn dogs at Short Leash Dogs.  These dogs did not disappoint.  They were the perfect blend of salty goodness of a local made, non-filler dog balanced with the sweetness of a homemade cornbread batter.  \"Gourmet corn dog\" sounds like an oxymoron, but Short Leash makes it a reality that works!  Can't wait to try more of their dogs."}
{"text":"My family has been looking forward to eating at Short Leash for sometime.  I give the food, the price point and the atmosphere 5 stars but because Tessas service was beyond effortless, lazy and rude I have to give an overall score of 2 stars. :("}
{"text":"There is a reason why Short Leash Dogs is the Number ONE Phoenix metro-area food truck and there is a reason why you will often find them to be the only truck with a line at all.  They are CRAZY GOOD!!!  Gourmet local dogs on warm naan flatbread with unique toppings - who would have thought?  I am not typically an adventerous eater, but this is a MUST TRY for everyone!  My husband and I are crazy for Short Leash Dogs and we are satisfying our cravings now an average of three times a week!  Really!  I am smitten about an \"adjusted Lady style dog\" - I order a spicy beer hot Lady with pinto beans and green chillis.  Yum!  The spice of the chipotle cream cheese and the crunch of the fried pickles are perfect with the snap of the spicy beer hot.  Unbelievably good I tell ya!  My husband has tried all of the suggested combinations and frequently orders the Featured Dog of the Week.  He has loved them all.  We have only gone wrong when we tried to make up our own - they weren't bad at all, just not as good at Kat and Brad's creations. They have deep fried pickles.. the good kind!  They start with local fresh pickles, batter and fry them to order.  We always share a side!  If you have never tried fried pickles, this is where you need to try them.  If you have had them other places, this is where you need to go to get them!   We only tried our own creations at our first visit and have since left the culinary creativity to these professionals!  We follow their schedule on Facebook and are excited to see that they are adding more regular locations in addition to their Phoenix Public Market days/nights... You can find them at Urban Cookies at lunch time on Tuesdays now, Urban Beans for dinner on the 3rd Thursday of the month and now EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT at their own spot behind Frances & Smeeks (Central/Camelback) called SIT...STAY.   They have a little dining area set up and a fixed sample menu.  (We have been there every Friday since they started.)  Great way to try different options in an inviting environment that makes you want to visit, sit and stay!  We luva-luva Short Leash and enjoy bringing friends and out of town guests to experience the Phoenix vibe that they have helped to create.  Again, I am not an adventerous eater.  I expected a weenie, standard bun, mustard and kraut from a hot dog truck.  I am sooo glad that I didn't find that here and I gave it a try!!   I will never have a regular dog again and I won't miss it either!"}
{"text":"I drive, walk or bike to this place almost every day.  I skip Lux because I'm sorry Lux fans, Rollover is just better.  Consistently good espresso and now they have donuts? Yeah, I'm a fan.  If you're expecting Krispy Kreme fluffy, well, this isn't the donut for you.  If you want chewy, textury, omg is that brioche based donut with the most unique combinations- then this is your place.  Spicy Thai is my favorite, the spicy chili in the custard is wonderful."}
{"text":"One of my buddies and I have been hitting up the Short Leash since early November, every Friday in fact. We missed Christmas and New Years day because the food truck court was closed on the holidays, the horror.  The owners are two of the most awesome people ever. They have remembered my name since the 2nd visit and since I'm a creature of habit I don't even have to tell him what I want, he just writes it down.  My favorite combination is a beer-hot dog with the siracha sauce, all 3 cheeses, and toss in a healthy sample of the cilantro. I'm going to lobby for including it on the menu having it named \"Dakota\" after my Bullmastiff.  Every single person I have taken to Short Leash loves it (over 20 now), and they always return for more."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood and wandered into the 101 East Roosevelt location looking for breakfast on Saturday December 23, 2017 at about 10:45am. There was a pleasant girl behind the counter-dark hair and glasses. There was 1 customer sitting at the counter. We were looking for breakfast and she offered us a breakfast menu...we were not sure what to have for breakfast so we ordered espresso drinks while we looked over the menu as she was making our drinks....after we received our drinks, we asked if we could order breakfast-to which she said. \"The kitchen stops serving breakfast at 11:00\" Why would you offer someone a breakfast menu and NOT mention that the kitchen stops serving breakfast in 15 minutes? Based on all the reviews here, it's really more of a hotdog & beer joint which it gets great reviews for.... You only get 1 chance to make a 1st impression and as far as a \" breakfast destination\" this place REALLY missed the mark with us, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I am not someone who likes hotdogs.. In fact, most times I turn my nose up at them... However, a few months back my friend invited me to a food truck event in Scottsdale and raved about the hotdogs.. I was up for an adventure and went for it.. and I was not disappointed. In fact, I've tried to recreate at home and I try to make it to the Short Leash Hotdog truck as often as possible.   The Lady Dog is where it is at with it's rich chipotle cream cheese and tangy friend pickles. I would recommend Short Leash Dogs to anyone. I am now a fan of hotdogs."}
{"text":"Short Leash is quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots. The people are kind, the food is wonderful, and the wait is never too long. Their veggie dog is the best I've had in the city (especially when smothered with barbecue sauce and blue cheese). I also appreciate their eclectic beverage assortment. It's such a fresh experience for the cost of a Burger Kind value meal."}
{"text":"Went back for seconds tonight at the Wednesday street market.   Life lesson for me: two dogs is more than even a fat guy can put down.   Another great outing at Short Leash. Sarah and I will be back again."}
{"text":"My first time at Short Leash Hot Dogs.  So far a great restaurant experience.  The waitresses/bartenders were very attentive and greeted me upon entering... Which is great.   I ordered the Mac Daddy and added the following ingredients: green chilies, bacon, mushrooms, and sautéed onions... It had to be done :).  The cool thing is that they did not gouge and charge for each extra topping.  Which is great because I like crazy combinations.  Oh, I forgot to mention I'm from Chicago.  So, no charge on the extra toppings, really was a plus.   The hot dog which is served in between naan, is fantastic!  Option fries or side salad..I went with side salad, which was great mixed greens (no Iceberg here) and a great balsamic.  To drink I order the Santa Fe  Happy Camper IPA.  It was tasty.  Good job Short Leash, I'll be back. Not to mention it is in the heart of Roosevelt Row, next door to the Nash. Around the corner from Firehouse gallery.  Good times"}
{"text":"I really should have gone here before since I am located so close. What a great reat. The name is a bit misleading, but do not let it fool you. The food here is excellant."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to taste these great dogs at the a street fair a couple of weeks ago. It was definately tasty! I opted to go with the Moki and a regular dog for the first time. It had a nice crisp skin and it truly was a great tasting dog. They have a ton of toppings to choose from, and I liked the combination of the Moki. I also liked the fact they have several options to choose from for their dogs. And they had a great selection of 'old school' soda.   A+ for service! While there was a huge line and they were definately working very hard and on a sunny spring day - the service was extremely friendly. I was not a fan of the pita bread, it was very good bread, I just would prefer my dog on a roll. I also thought the price was reasonable - $5 for the dog. (I didn't get a drink, I didn't see the selection of soda until after I had paid and I didn't want to hold the other people up, there was a huge line that day).   A+ for presention. It's not just a dog slapped in a pita - it's neatly placed and rolled in the pita with a toothpick and pickel (check out my pictures).  I am looking forward to trying their other selection of dogs!  Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night. The menu offers creative combinations of toppings and then you pick the style of sausage you want and it's all served on warm naan. At first, I was given the wrong order, but the staff was friendly, quick to apologize and fixed their mistake. The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20, we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery. Awesome."}
{"text":"Cute spot in a cute neighborhood. Rollover is our go-to for coffee and doughnuts. The orange pistachio doughnut is my favorite. We love bringing our dog and getting the home made dog biscuits too!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Austin, where crunchy vegan-friendly restaurants abound, trying to find a replacement for the girlfriends favorite veg-friendly hot-dog place in Austin has been hard to find... Alas Short Leash has surpassed even her expectations. Great service, fast, friendly, and too many variations on toppings to list.  I cant even pretend to know what hers was like because i greedily devoured mine ( the igby: coleslaw, bleu cheese, bbq sauce ) with reckless disregard for my fingers. Going to make it to Short Leash as often as possible....i only gave it 5 stars because i cant give it anymore."}
{"text":"Short Leash Dogs has the BEST hot dogs around!!  I met my dad here for lunch the other day.  I thought he was pulling my leg when he told me he was buying us hot dogs for lunch and he is a \"restaurant\" kind of guy.  This little hot dog wagon cranks out some of the best tasting dogs!  I had the Aiko with the spicy dog and it was delish!  We also had some of their corn pups that I think had habanero chilies.  They were oh-so-good!  I can't wait until we go back!"}
{"text":"Thank you for being amazing!  Short Leash Dogs is great people!  Very sweet with excellent customer service.  I explained to my husband that all I wanted was a good, a REALLY good veggie hot dog.  The next day we visited Short Leash and I couldn't be more pleased!  While they do employee the tofu Smart Dog (which I previously have found bland), their take on how to dress the dog drove me to buy my own pack that same day.  They have very eccentric toppings, the themes of which are inspired by the personalities of their favorite dogs.  My husband, who is not a vegetarian really enjoyed their hand-breaded corn dogs.  I believe there are 4 (?) non-veggie dog/brat choices.  We are considering having them cater our next big event!!  We also plan on visiting them much more often and with our pups in tow."}
{"text":"That orange glaze w/pistachio donut: AWESOME! And to be honest, I've never liked pistachios. I also tried a couple other flavors that were just as amazing, as well as the coffee. Which was fantastic because it wasn't bitter or burnt tasting like a lot of places. It was mellow but flavorful; you could actually ENJOY the taste."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place.  Being from Chicago, I love a Chicago dog any day of the week but what I liked best about Short Leash is the creativity.  You can even chose the type of wiener you're in the mood for...regular, beef, beer hot and brats.  And the flatbread instead of a bun is just the right combination to let you know you're having something special.    Igby is my favorite.  Well, honestly, it's the only one I've had because I like it so much I order it every time.  I'm planning on trying the Moki next and then maybe create my own.  After a couple more Igbys, that is.  Visit them at the Phoenix Public Market on a Saturday morning or Wednesday evening and check out some of the local goodies while you're there."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this cart since they first started.  Amazing creative dogs and a great price.  I really appreciate that for a set price you can get as creative as you'd like with your hot dog. The list of toppings is quite impressive and I enjoy that it's local and organic. The flat bread bun is more than filling and a great way to mix things up.   As far as hot dogs go, I feel like Short Leash gives me the most bang for my buck. I try a lot of dog places and they go above and beyond. There is nothing better than filling up on a locally made sausage loaded with just about anything you want for $5.00"}
{"text":". The best part is they have vegan options with great toppings to choose from.. Definitely the best food truck I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Absolutley delicious.  Although the line was long it went pretty fast.  Hot Dog in a flatbread?  Yes!  Especially with a spicy beer dog and crisp bacon!  Best dog I can remember... And it was out of a truck."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic people. Brad and Kat have a true Arizona gem.  Take quality product (their food) with clear and consistent branding, and run your business with love and genuine smiles--that's the ticket to a successful business.  Not many do that well any more. Short Leash does and we love them for it."}
{"text":"Super nice people. Pretty good dogs. Unexpected roll--it was flatbread.  We saw them at the Phoenix Public Market.  They were super friendly, did I mention that?  If you are looking for generic hot dog, this ain't it.  If you are looking for tasty friendly food at the Market, they're great."}
{"text":"We first saw this place at the food trucks in the Phoenix Public Market.  Unfortunately they were sold out (which is a sign that it must be good).  We drove over to the stand-alone location only to find out they sold out their last one right before we got there.  Now, we were on a mission to get it.  Next morning before we headed to the airport, we stopped by and bought half a dozen.  By far the best flavors are the Coconut creme and Strawberry glaze.  All the others were good but not as good as those two."}
{"text":"Great food! There are a ton of choices. I like to make my own, usually a brat with local hot sauce, blue cheese and sauteed onions. And always have to get a corn pup!  They also have gluten free options."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. I tried it on my lunch break and the brats were better than expected. I'll be sure to go back"}
{"text":"Great food! I NEVER eat a hot dog; however, I was pressured to try Short Leash and was not disappointed at all! I was not only able to to select special toppings, but could also select unique meat such as a duck dog, my combination was amazing, I will definitely try another.  Now we just need a cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"I don't always get excited about hot dogs, but this is NOT your typical soggy-bun plus shriveled-dog kind of hot dog stand. They have a variety of meats to choose from, from veggie to brat to spicy beer dog, and a huge list of unique toppings like mango chutney and chipotle cream cheese. My absolute favorite part is the warm fluffy pita bread that your dog comes on instead of a plan old bun.  If you're a Short Leash newbie, try one of their combos like the Aiko, which Brad recommended I try with the spicy dog for a perfect sweet-and-spicy combination. Or go for their featured Dog of the Day, which today was a Greek-style dog with feta and homemade tzatziki sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"Update:   Rollover has gone downhill since converting from Shine and lacks execution.  Most of the donuts are sold out by 9:30AM.  Why not make more, toss a few out that don't sell and make the high margins on the ones that do sell.  Business makes more $ and customers are happier.  Inside seating also smells like a basement.  --------- Doughnuts are OK, nothing special.  They need to label the types so you don't have to ask.  They didn't have a menu so no idea what they serve or prices.  I expect a few bugs because it's new but these are basic expectations.  I'm confident they can turn it around because Short Leash Dogs is fantastic."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Short Leash Dogs owns!  The first sign that things were about to get very good was when a saw a fork on my dog.  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be messy and that's what I like.  I scanned the menu and opted for the Moki dog.  It began with my choice of dog (regular wiener) and then topped with green chilies, pinto beans, mayo, tomatoes, and onions.  It may be the best dog I have ever had.  It was that good.  All the flavors exploded in my mouth.  Short Leash Dogs has managed to turn a simple American culinary staple into something that is utterly amazing.  My only beef with Short Leash Dogs is they tend to operate on a schedule I cannot sync with because of work.  Today I lucked out when they opened shop for the day at a Whole Foods by my place of work.  Can I really hold that against them?  No, I cannot.  Time to find a new job!"}
{"text":"$5 for an amazingly delicious taste explosion in my mouth? Yes please. : ) I finally was able to try SLD out today (thanks testing break!). I got up to the window and said, \"I'm so excited to be here right now!\" The owner just laughed at me. I don't blame him. I'm completely ridiculous!  Anyhow, I ordered the Lady and added green chilis and sriracha with a chicken dog. The owner asked if I liked spicy things, and I gave him a resounding \"Yes!\" He suggested next time I order a Devil Dog. I cannot wait for that day!  Super friendly service, amazingly tastetastic food, yeah, that just about sums it up. Yep."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after church for a sugary treat with a friend. I ordered the apple fritter and my friend got the maple bacon. I'm typically not a fan of bacon on donuts but this one was legit and the bacon was the best I've ever had on an donut.  I was told the apple fritters were extra large that day and they were delicious as well. Customer service was exceptional and the atmosphere was fun. Lots of seating available."}
{"text":"I'm not really a hot dog guy (not that there's anything wrong with that). When I crave a hot dog, I might get one and one is always necessary at a ball game and once in awhile i will get a hot dog at the gas station when in a pinch, but in general, I am not the sort of guy to go out of my way to find a wiener.  That being said...The first time I went to Short Leash at the Public Market with Ayesha S. It was damned good but ya know...still a hotdog, not my thing necessarily. Second time I went was with Julia T. and I think \"yeah I kinda get it, if you are into hot dogs...\" Third time...something just opened inside of me...something magical and warm and I felt like Belle in Beauty and the Beast, my heart opening up and for the  first time not viewing it just as a hot dog (There must be something there that wasn't there before) but as a sandwich, a meal, a real step above what I am used to in the hot dog department.  The actual hotdog...it is...How do i put it?...the texture and flavour are like BAM. Then the toppings...pick your own or go with one of the choice combinations they list...also they run specials with pet dog namesakes. You probably aren't going to get it wrong no matter what you go with.  The toppings are fresh, tasty and they are not stingy with em. It all gets loaded up into a flatbread which sounds odd but works.  Here is the real kicker...these people are effing rad. I walk up and guy says to me \"I'm sorry, I forgot your name.\" I had been there twice and not that recently I didn't even expect him to remember who I was at all.   So then I go pay with my card and realize I forgot to get a bottle of water for my dog. The guy gives me a bowl of water for him and then the lady behind the counter asks if he can have a hotdog. She even assures me they are 100 percent beef. Gives my dog a free hot dog! Mind you I think they appreciated the work he was doing gathering signatures for the DT dog park. *ching* I felt tingly all over and knew it was true love.   Cray good. CRAZY good."}
{"text":"My sisters and I visited here a few weeks ago. We truly enjoyed ourselves! My one sister is a vegetarian and we were so glad to find a cool lunch spot that had an option for her! Everyone we encountered was friendly and the hot dogs were tasty. Be careful with their donuts though...I'm not sure if it was because it was the afternoon but the donuts were not very good."}
{"text":"So we tried 3 donuts. A chocolate cake with cookie dough frosting, pistachio and the last was a coconut cream.  We really wanted to like the donuts and the place. But in the end the donuts were just bad. Really bad. I tried cutting the chocolate cookie dough donut with a fork but had to resort to tearing by hand. They were so dry and chewy that we weren't sure if it was made the same day or not.  Flavors tasted artificial at best.  We took a single bite of each donut and threw them away. Maybe it was an off day but you'd think a Saturday morning would be \"A\" game time for a donut shop."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong. Didn't discover it until I was home since I got it to go.  Didn't have time to go back, so I just ate it.  Didn't like it, but that's probably because I didn't like the ingredients and would have never ordered it.  Staff seemed friendly and it seems like a decent spot to eat, but obviously getting the order right is important."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are soft and chewy.  The apple fritter is my favorite; sweet with bits of apple and easy to pull apart and eat.  All the flavors of doughnuts I've tried have been very good."}
{"text":"Short leash is quite unique, but the novelty wears off quick.  I've been to the food truck twice and the restaurant a couple times as well. I liked it the first time, but it was all about the novelty factor. Additionally all of their items are priced quite high. for a regular dog, it was 9-10 bucks. I would be okay with it if it were a substantial portion. Unfortunately, it leaves me hungry.  Overall, a cool concept, but not worth the value. It's good if you want to try something new, and don't care about bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The selection of beer is vast and very reasonably priced. Good place to eat over all. Customer Service was questionable, even though they were not busy."}
{"text":"We hired the food truck for a backyard party we were hosting. Katherine, Ariel, and Megan manned the truck for 2.5 hours and were GREAT! They were so friendly, pleasant, and helpful. The hot dog truck was the hit of the party - the food was just delicious!  Short Leash was on time, supplied all the necessities (dogs, chips, other snacks, napkins, plasticware, etc.), squeezed into a tight spot in our backyard, and made sure everyone was happy. It was a great time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs in pitas to hold all of the toppings. I like their selection. It's a great place to come and have lunch, it's community-oriented, people are very friendly. There is a patio to sit outside. Be back to try some of them."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the staff, love love the food! My favorite is the Igby."}
{"text":"I stopped eating hot dogs years ago...too scary, too salty, too mysterious.  But all that changed with my first exposure to Short Leash Hot Dogs.  I am not an overboard foodie who likes bleu cheese on a hot dog.  I am a purist.  Call me old-fashioned, call me a traditionalist, but I like my hot dogs BASIC.  Mustard only.  I love that they don't give me a sad look when I order, they just deliver a great dog that fills the length of the superb nan bread.  Perfectly prepared, no mustard drips on my lap!   Childhood is a state of mind and when I take a Short Leash bite, I'm zapped back to ball games with my dad, summer days at the pool, memories of the real thing!   As good as it gets!  Phoenix is so lucky to have them!"}
{"text":"Our first choice for lunch was closed so we decided to check this place out and we are glad we did! They do breakfast and lunch. Hot dogs are naturally their specialty but they have other menu items including loaded fries which were delicious. Both indoor and outdoor seating available. Portions are quite large- we shared fries and each got a hot dog and were stuffed by the end. It looks like they have an incredible beer list but we stuck to water while we were there. Plenty of parking around the area so you shouldn't have trouble there. It looked like carry out was also very common so if you need to grab something quick or to go you are in luck! Sit outside and people watch!"}
{"text":"I was going to Shine Coffee around lunch time and was pleasantly surprised that Short Leash had their food truck there. The staff were very friendly, down to earth and patient. I ordered a veggie dog with green chilies and pinto beans but they have a great unique assortment of hot dogs and fixings. The hot dog was wrapped in a sort of pita bread. It was delicious. The service and the experience was great. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"This did not taste anything like CA hotdogs, but the taste was great. The service was really good and the restaurant was really clean. I will really want to out the truck service. Gave it four stars because I was expecting it the food to be better."}
{"text":"Been trying to get a Short Leash Dog for months. Today I made it downtown to food truck Friday. I hauled ass directly to Short Leash Dogs. I was not disappointed. Menu looked good. The special stole my heart. It had bacon, lettuce, fried green tomatoes, bleu cheese dressing & I chose the spicey dog served on flat bread. The dog had the best snap to it & was hot. Loved every bite. I reccomend trying Short Leash Dogs if you get the chance & hunt them down if you don't. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I am a bonafide food truck fan. From the very early days of waiting for the Kogi BBQ truck in SoCal way before the entire food truck revolution when groups would be gathered at seemingly odd spots with people curiously wondering what the heck we were waiting for. Well, it's not so weird anymore with the rise of numerous food trucks and I was happy to see that Phoenix was no exception. When I moved from SoCal, I was really bummed about leaving my food trucks. I'm dead serious.  But life is a bit brighter now that I've found several delicious food trucks here in Phoenix, including Short Leash Dogs. Of the few that I have tried so far, SLD is definitely the meal that gave me the most bang for my buck.   My fiance and I tried the Lady combination on a bratwurst. I didn't know what to expect so when we received our hot dog wrapped in flatbread as opposed to a regular hot dog bun we were pleasantly surprised. Think about it...the larger flatbread holding the hot dog can also hold more toppings and thus, more yummy flavor!  SLD has quite a few options to choose from so it will be fun going back to check out other flavors. And as others have pointed out, the service is great. The wait time is as expected for a food truck serving lots of customers - no biggie, that's just how food truck dining rolls - besides, as every foodie knows the good stuff is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Listen. And Listen Carefully.   These hot dogs are unlike anything you've ever experienced. My company sponsors a weekly \"Food Truck Wednesday\" event and ever since my first experience, I wait in anticipation to see if Short Leash Dogs will be there. Literally like a kid waiting for Christmas.   I ordered my own hot dog creation, I don't remember what was in it. But it was so good, I had to put the hot dog down after the first bite to make sure it was real.   I rarely eat hot dogs and I primarily consume them twice a year during a typical Labor Day or Memorial Day BBQ but I will travel for Short Leash Dogs. Yes, I said, Travel for a Hot Dog!   It's that real."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs. They usually leave me feeling icky and gassy and no one wants to be around me after I've had one. But when we asked our friend to take us somewhere delicious in Phoenix, she suggested Short Leash, so we threw caution to the wind and went with her.  This is definitely not your typical hot dog place. There are all kinds of flavors to choose from, and you can choose the type of wiener you get. During this visit, I opted for an all beef Bear -- peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce, and Cracker Jack. Yep. Cracker Jack and I also don't have a good relationship, but it sounded like a good day to give things a second chance. When our orders came out, each wiener was wrapped in fluffy naan rather than the traditional hot dog bun. I was absolutely blown away by the flavor combination in the Bear. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce, Cracker Jack, and peanut butter mixed perfectly with the savory gouda and meat. I never knew a hot dog could taste so good.  Seating at this brick and mortar shop is also pretty spacious. Plenty of seats indoors and outdoors."}
{"text":"The donuts are good and large portions, however $23 for a dozen is a little pricey for me. Location is easy to access from Central Avenue. Just wish at least ONE of the breakfast menu items didn't include onions. We don't all want onion breath all day."}
{"text":"One of the docs where I work brought these in. I split the maple bacon with someone (because it's giant) and bit into the most delicious effing donuts I've had in ages. It's substantial, too! It's close to my work, so I can imagine the picking these up for the family on occasion for sure."}
{"text":"I like these dogs because they are more like a sandwich than your typical American Frank.  They are served on a delicious flat bread/pita  \"bun\" and are filled with all sorts of toppings - not just ketchup and relish- I'm talking beans, cilantro, onions, chipotle, cheese, and peppers.   And yes, they do have a vegetarian one!! Their mock meat looked so real it was eerie - I took a nibble and I couldn't tell if they had accidently given me a real hot dog!  So, I tore off a little chunk and showed it to the hot dog man, \"This is a vegetarian one, right?!\"  He laughed and said, \"Yes.  We actually get that comment quite often.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Hot Dog! As a matter of fact, calling it simply a hot dog is an understatement. I had the Beer Hot- Aiko Style and was really happy with my choice. I would've never thought to put that combination of ingredients together on a hot dog but it works! The warm Naan bread was so good, I'm suck a sucker for warm bread. I visited them at Food Truck Friday's in Phoenix and the whole time I was there they consistently had the longest line of all the other food trucks yet their service was relatively fast. I'd say to go out of your way to hunt them down at least once because they are worth it! As far as a food truck is concerned I don't think they could've done any better! They have great food, an eclectic drink selection and friendly service."}
{"text":"Always a fun lunch with awesome service from a happy and cheerful staff!  Short Leash never disappoints."}
{"text":"Their truck was mentioned on YELP talk by Anthony and lo and behold they were in the parking lot of the Four Peaks Tasting room last night.  First off I will note I am vegetarian so I am only reviewing the veggie dogs but they were spectacular.  I had the Aiko ( Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo + added sirracha), Igby  (Coleslaw and crumbled Bleu Cheese drizzled with tangy BBQ sauce) and we shared a side of fried pickles.  By far my favorite is the Igby and I wasn't that big of a fan of coleslaw before I had it even.  It's a perfect blend of crunchy, tangy, and sweet. The staff running the truck are extremely nice, friendly and very fun to chat with while I waited for the food. They made excellent suggestions so ask them what they think if you can't decide.  You are doing yourself a disservice by not tracking them down ASAP.  TRY: - Igby - Aiko"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix. Tuesday is $2 can beer and they are some of the finest beers. Never been disappointed with a hot dog or a donut. And, the specials are always worth trying."}
{"text":"When you want the best food on earth & awesome ambience mixed with excellent customer service. Short Leash sets the standard!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I really couldn't have enjoyed my first experience at Short Leash Dogs Food Truck more.  I had the pleasure of experiencing this tasty treat before a recent Secret Cinema Event.  I was excited to give this food truck a try, as it's been on my \"to try\" list for quite some time.  Now down to business... the food...  I ordered a regular wiener \"lady\" style and shared a side of fried pickles.  The fried pickles were everything a fried food should be and more.  Perfectly seasoned, fried golden, and served warm with a side of ranch.  YUM.  I could eat those babies all day.  As for the dog, it was to die for.  Loved the pita bread, the spicy mayo, and of course more fried pickles.  The dog had a great \"snap\" and was extremely flavorful on it's own.  The Hubs had the spicy dog with the style that featured peanut butter.  It was surprisingly sweet, but also very good.  Though we had to wait awhile for them to cook up our order, it was surely worth the wait.  I can't wait to try some more of Short Leash Dogs amazing offerings!"}
{"text":"The combination of Art and Hot Dogs has been competently accomplished by this man and woman team in a mobile food cart. And they're having fun doing it. And the food is made with love. And the soda selection is perfect. And the price is reasonable. And you shouldn't start a sentence with \"And\". And Short Leash Dogs makes commuting downtown bearable. And the fried pickles are a real treat. And I'll never wanna eat another hot dog in a bun... gimmie a warm flat bread. And who knew that corn dogs could be so gourmet. And I love Short Leash Dogs!"}
{"text":"I'd drive to any part of the city to find this food truck.  The food is great (Igby and a corn pup...mmmmmm).  They make you feel like you're a friend when you patronize them.  Shortleash is easily in my top 5 places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"This is a cute quaint place. The donuts are quite dense but they have unique flavors. I prefer a fluffier donut but these were gear! Got to try the special of the week. It was a seven layer doughnut. It had chocolate, caramel, graham crackers, walnuts, and coconut. It was filled with a coconut cream. I'm not a huge fan of filled doughnuts but it the flavors were great. It was slightly too sweet for me and couldn't finish it but it was great! I also tried the maple bacon! And I loved it. Overall adorable place with delicious unique donuts."}
{"text":"Sooooooo amazing! Why are the donuts so huge?! I love them! I totally didn't expect them to be so big. I am so excited. Everyone in my offices loves them and has been asking me where I got them. They are awesome! Thanks."}
{"text":"Moki (with a beer hot), no mayo, add Sriracha and bacon.  Life changing."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite food trucks. I adore Short Leash! From the fluffy naan to the high quality dogs and the killer service, this place rocks. I have to admit I overlooked it many a time at Food Truck Fridays, having a hard time imagining paying $6 for a hotdog. But the people kept lining up, and I started seeing these glorious creations and figured I'd take the plunge. The Igby is my absolute favorite. I always get it with the spicy beer wiener, and it includes coleslaw, blue cheese, and bbq sauce! YUM! It never gets old! I keep telling myself I'm going to get something else, but I'm hooked! I am so excited to get down and try their brick and mortar place! Short Leash Dogs are worth every penny!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food truck (it's easily our favorite of the bunch in Phoenix), so we had them cater our wedding. It's really saying something that one place can appeal equally to a family full of ravenous meat eaters just as much as it can to vegans (we had both at our wedding and both were in love with what the ordered.) Their catering menu is somehow even more interesting than their already robust and dynamic truck menu, and their prices are fantastic for what you get. We ordered their salad, mac & cheese and awesome potato salad as our sides and people almost literally couldn't get enough.   Every time I do business with this place, I come away impressed with how awesome they are. It's a delight to have such a dynamic, interesting and delicious place right in the heart of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart! No sirree Bob, if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water, steamed buns, and French's mustard you may want to keep driving.  However, if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook, then this is your place. Hot dogs with gouda cheese, bacon, and even peanut butter as toppings. I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious. Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed them.  Additionally, at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as well.  Finally, the service was great! Despite the crowds, service was friendly, attentive, and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucks.  Short Leash Dogs - we will be back!"}
{"text":"This was set up for work. I wasn't interested in any crazy toppings so I just ordered a brat with relish, onion and ketchup. It's served on a gyro bread. I had the coleslaw which didn't have any flavor, tasted like I was just eating plain cabbage. The donut was extremely greasy. And very chewy. I've never seen such a skinny bratwurst not really sure it was a brat, I think it was a dog.  Don't think I'll go out of my way to eat from here"}
{"text":"I have been faithful to only Short Leash dogs for years and just realized that I had not written them a proper review.  First, Brad and Kat, the owners/operators/chefs/etc, are the most friendly folks you could hope to meet. Talk about service with a smile.And, as a vegetarian that loved hot dogs in my past life, it is wonderful to have so many tasty options in one spot to satisfy me and my meet loving husband. The Igby is my personal fave, or was, until I tried the Bear. Served on delicious pita-like flatbread, it is covered in peanut butter, gouda and cracker jacks.......OMG!!! Had one Saturday and going today for another. Yeah....that good! Also, try the fried pickles! The fried pickles are a delicious side to the interesting dog combos they offer.   I can't say enough phenomenal things about their unique take on hot dogs or the flavorful concoctions they have come up with......My mouth is watering and yours should be too. So why are you still reading this? Find that food truck!"}
{"text":"A friend once told my husband and I that Short Leash has the best for dogs in Phoenix, but the line was crazy long when we saw the truck at the Phoenix local fest, so we passed.  No line at 10am at the Gilbert Farmer's Market...yes please!!  I ordered the Lady. My husband ordered the Aiko. We both got the all beef dog. Freaking AMAZING!!!! The only complaint is that my husband expected more toppings (cilantro, red onion), but instead thought the little bit there was had been mixed in to the mango chutney. We also ordered two kids corndogs. At $3 each they were a little pricey. The kids liked them but picked the batter off.  I still give them five stars. Can't wait to catch them around town again."}
{"text":"OK so I'm late to this party but we had the truck at work today so I decided to go for it.  I ordered \"the Lady\" with a chicken hot dog.  All I can say is WOW!!!  The dog itself was from Schreiners and it was top notch.  So fresh and yummy!  I don't do well with chemicals and additives and this had none at all!  It was served on grilled naan with sauteed onions, fried pickles, and spicy cream cheese.    I was a little leery as I have not had a dog in at least 5 years and don't have the digestive power anymore but this went down really well.  The guys on the truck were very welcoming and helpful and I cannot recommend this truck any more highly.  Their menu is really diverse and has a lot of different option, including vegetarian.  This little company does SO many things well...give them a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My biggest problem with Short Leash is that the Chicken Igby dog is so good that I haven't tried anything else. Sure, the other dogs look tempting, but a hot dog with BBQ sauce, blue cheese, and cole slaw is too good to pass up, and I crave it before I go. The chicken itself is high quality - slightly spicy, but not too much so. And the side of fried pickles ($3) is excellent and I have a hard time passing that up as well. Thankfully Short Leash goes to Urban Cookies every Tuesday for lunch, and that's just a couple miles from where I work. Of course, that means I may just have to stop in for a cookie as well..."}
{"text":"Short Leash catered our family birthday event. Wow - Fantastic food and fantastic  people! They are professional and very personable! We highly recommend Short Leash for all special events!"}
{"text":"Nice meal with good service on a Saturday morning. We were the first people in on Saturday and had a nice time."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when this food truck showed up to a company event over in Chandler.  They told me their green chilies come out of a can - I was thinking \"yuck\" - you guys need to invest in a large freezer and buy Hatch green chilies.  Having said that, I tried a dog with mustard, sauteed onion, relish, and kraut - it was one of the best dogs I have ever eaten!  I highly recommend trying this Food Truck if it comes to an event near you!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"These dogs are really as good as it gets!!!! Love me some Short Leash Dogs!!!"}
{"text":"So far I've had the Aiko and the Moki and both were super delicious (the Aiko tastes better)! The meat they use for the original wieners are good quality. I've tried a few other food trucks and Short Leash is by far the best both in quality and value. It's $5 for a dog and in my opinion, that's not a bad price for a gourmet hot dog.  There's always been a long line when I've gone there, and everything is made to order. With that said, be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes after you order.  Service is awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"First off... very blah coffee. But if you're here for the coffee, you're missing the point.  The donuts are amazing. Creative flavors in creative combinations, about as sugary-sweet and fatty as possible, and just delicious.  So grab your coffee somewhere else and then get your butt to Rollover for amazing donuts."}
{"text":"Rollover Donuts is the latest venture from Brad & Kat of Short Leash Dogs!  Housed in the former Shine Coffee location, they have freshly made donuts and outstanding coffee! The coffee is amazing, and you can get anything you can think of, from a fresh drip, to salted caramel latte.  While the coffee is great, the doughnuts are the stars of the show.  Try the chocolate chip cookie dough doughnut- it will knock your socks off- so wear two pairs! I also tried the chocolate iced with walnuts, and it was sooooo good.  These doughnuts are brioche based, so they are different than old school cake donuts, but in a really good way, much like fancy wood fired pizza is different than more pedestrian types of pizza.  As with the other Short Leash ventures, Rollover Doughnuts has an outstanding since of community. It's really cool to be in the sixth biggest city in the country, and it feels like a small town. Brad, Kat, & Co. go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable, and its a very nice touch.  Long live Rollover Doughnuts, another great reason why Phoenix is a great place to be."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll be honest: I came here exclusively to try the Iced Orange Cardamom Latte as well as the Iced Rose Cognac Latte and as soon as I walked in and asked for it, they informed me they no longer have either of them! It was kind of upsetting because I have really only fulfilled my floral latte obsession once before and that was exactly a year ago in Savannah, Georgia. Instead, I settled on a Frito Pie and a Chocolate Walnut Doughnut. I know it's a weird combo, but let me tell you, it was damn delicious. The Frito pie is veggie (I don't typically love vegetarian-style chili but this was really good) and the Chocolate Walnut Doughnut was garnished with spiced walnuts on top.   The store is actually connected to the Short Leash Hot Dog joint, which is where the Frito Pie came from. They specialize in signature hot dogs (I'm pretty sure they had at least 20 on the menu) and I'm definitely going back to try them! Cute little spot with lots of space and friendly waitstaff.   *Easily accessible via Light Rail/Valley Metro Bus   On a side note, if anyone knows of a place that has a floral latte like a lavender latte or a rose latte like this one^ SAY SOMETHING! I'm buying!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place on National Hotdog Day and im so glad I did. They really were able to execute their ambitious hotdog/sausage menu. Their dished are inventive, creative, and pair well together with the homemade potato chips and craft beer selection. Located in the Phoenix Arts District, you feel at home and comfortable in a great space with artistic surroundings. All in all, it was a good and welcoming experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome little doughnut place. Set up near downtown, they offer many varieties of doughnuts. I got the maple bacon doughnut which was an absolute delight. A bit pricey considering the fact that you can probably go grab the same doughnuts at other places for a dollar. However, I knew what I was getting myself into. I bought two doggy treats for my lab. She loved them!! Good place, good area and good doughnuts. I recommend trying at least once."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out Short Leash Dogs for quite some time after hearing lots of buzz on Yelp and on Phoenix New Times.  A trip to the Urban Grocery store for some wine tasting yesterday provided a perfect opportunity.  There were four specialty dogs up for grabs, but after subbing out my blue cheese for cheddar, I decided to go completely original and ditch the coleslaw for pinto beans.  I went with a beer hot based on the guy's recommendation.    What can I say?  This dog was magical.  I think I loved the bun best.  I don't know what it was, but it was soft and fluffy and held the dog and fixings well.  Beans, of course, went tremendously with the slightly spicy dog.  And all for just $5.  Phoenix, you need to try this place."}
{"text":"5 star dogs... Service was a bit slow - we came at opening with a baby and a toddler which means we don't get to casually converse and linger - but somehow we lasted a whole hour and then some, and service was friendly. The kids' mac and cheese looked so good I had to steal a few bites from my little one. It was good. The hot dog combos were delicious. Overall, we loved it and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I like hot dogs. A lot. And these folks make them healthy-ish, from local ingridients, and even offer gluten free options!   I was so impressed with them, and love the fact that it's a mobile business. Hoesntly, if you're a fan or meat on a stick, you need to try it. It just may have pushed Costco out as the Valley's best hot dog vendor!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed Short Leash? I am so impressed with this food truck. Brad and Kat are always friendly and gracious, even when lines are 40 people long and they're running low on supplies. I've never had anything here that I didn't like. I usually get a chicken dog and it doesn't disappoint! Get anything here. Seriously. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I always make my own dog, so this review is not for a particular dog. It's super crowded at this location on weekends so the wait will be a while.  Service is always great, price is reasonable. It's a specialty hot dog restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend brought in Short Leash to cater her wedding reception and it was a great time!  They were friendly and fast.  I had heard about the infamous Bear Dog, which has BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, peanut butter and Cracker Jax so I had to get it.  It was surprisingly delicious.  I'm not sure the amount of drugs or alcohol that had to be consumed to come up with this concoction but I'm glad they did.    A must-try for any self respecting foodie!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs I have had thus far and had them twice. Once at the Scottsdale Art festival and they've catered at my job. I've ordered the Aiko - mango chutney, cilantro, jalapeños, red onions, beef hit dog wrapped in a flat bread: Oh so delish! That mango chutney is amazing."}
{"text":"Ate here months ago for the first time. Just now getting around to the review. Service was efficient and friendly. I ordered \"to go\" and they gave me an extra flatbread/bun on the side, just in case the dog they prepared got soggy.  I ordered the veggie dog, toppings were generous and tasty."}
{"text":"Holy cow this was good. I'm not a hot dog person but they have chicken sausage and bratwurst options. I got the chicken Moki style, OMG it was incredible!! Pinto beans, shredded cheese, tomato and chiles on Naan  flatbread. It is amazing. I may have to hit them up tomorrow and get another one. They have a brick and mortar store in addition to the mobile option."}
{"text":"Love these dogs!  If you love hot dogs, you should track down this truck immediately. I always get the same thing--the dog with the sauerkraut--but everyone I've dined with has loved their selections too.  Ask the owners what combos they suggest for the various toppings.  They are incredibly nice and knowledgeable.  You will have to wait for your food longer than if you get a hot dog at Costco (which I also love), but it will be worth it.  It's good food, not fast food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim as we were hanging out down town. Just wanted to take a look, but the doughnuts were calling our name so we decided to try one. Shared the Peanut Butter Dream as I am a peanut butter lover. The peanut butter cream filling was rich, but not too rich and delicious, but the cake/dough was dry and not very flavorful. I would probably stop in and try again sometime; this may have just been a less than stellar batch. The doughnuts are beautiful no doubt; hopefully next time they taste just as good as they look! Customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"So I heard all about this bear special.  It has peanut butter on a hot dog?  Hmmmm. Well I tried it and - it was actually pretty good!  I also tried a brat with sauerkraut jalapeño cream cheese and something else.  The possibilities are endless. My work makes weekly trips to go there.  Can't wait until they open up full time at the biltmore!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Food Truck that visits the Biltmore area on Tuesdays. Will be happy when they finally open their store front there. The hot dog is a great butcher dog made locally, natural casing beef and pork dog. The dog is cooked to order, wrapped in Naan. I got the chipotle cream cheese and green chilis on mine. Overall very nice dog."}
{"text":"Top notch folks! Had the Aiko.  Pita was light and airy, all beef dog was tasty and the mango chutney was great without being overpowering.  Chased it down with a Ruski lemonade. Shame on me for not coming out here sooner.  So many possible combinations for custom dogs too! cheers"}
{"text":"Great sausages (from Schreiner's), creative and tasty combinations for fixins, on hot naan bread. And wonderful, friendly people - they made sure that I enjoyed what I ordered. A great meal, definitely. I wish there were more than one truck, and I wish one were stationed closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Short Leash Dogs are the best Hot Dogs in Town. If you are in downtown Phoenix on a Friday afternoon, you should head over to Short Leash and try one of their awesome Hot Dogs.   My favorite hot dog is the Bear; it has peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked Gouda, bacon and BBQ Sauce on the Hot Dog.  Or you can create your own masterpiece with your choice of these 20+ toppings!"}
{"text":"During superbowl weekend, we spent much of our awake time at the Whatever USA event in downtown phoenix. This was a monster event which included free budlight branded booze and food trucks that were changed twice each day the event was being held.  After we literally just picked up an order from the brick and mortar short leash dogs location, stopping at our condo, and coming back onto the Whatever grounds, the short leash dogs truck was also there -offering up free food. Of course.  Well I sampled the crispy dog which was a jalapeno cheese filled dog, with some cheesy spicy sauce, wrapped in a crispy corn tortilla and fried up. It was delicious. My hubs who isn't typically a fan of jalapeno'd fare also expressed the same omg this is bomb face."}
{"text":"Really cool store in a really cool area. There are games and a cool seating area. Doughnut was tasty. Selection was limited they probably only had like 30 doughnuts total. Also a little bit pricy, $2.50 or so."}
{"text":"The Strawberry Glazed donut tastes like strawberry jam every bite YUM!! Went  recently coz it's slow at work plus I had a hankering for coffee, and starbucks gets lame, the coffee at the market downstairs, although fresh and cheap is not delicious, so, Rollover sounded like a good place for coffee and a sweet treat. I have to say although I'm not a big fan of brioche donuts (more of a cake donut fan), their flavors are on point. Albeit pricey for specialty donuts at $2.25/piece and the regular donuts at a little less than 2 but their baker's dozen comes out to $14, so, not bad. I like they have a good selection of coffee and carry alternative milks, like soy and almond although there is a 50 cent upcharge but no big. Will I go back? Yes, and next time I'm gonna try the maple glaze with bacon, the other specialties just sound too weird for my taste like the Bear which is bbq sauce and pb, say what?! Anywho, try out the goodness!"}
{"text":"Very good dogs!  Simple as that. Great assortment of dogs. I love the spin with the pita bread instead of buns. Make sure your servers are on point and you are properly staffed for busy times. That's the only thing that stopped me from granting 5 stars.   Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Creativity in your mouth! When you think of hot dogs, they can be pretty boring. I almost never order them when I'm out, because I could easily just make one at home or there's usually more interesting options. This is not the case with Short Leash. Who would've thought that peanut butter, bacon, Gorgonzola, and Kracker Jax would go well on a hot dog?? Well it does, and it's awesome! Everything else I've tried is awesome too, including their fried pickles. I love these people!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst doughnut I have ever had. Shared it with my significant other and he was not impressed either     Extremely dry, as if you were biting into a piece of the Sahara desert........  I asked the server what were the flavour  of the doughnuts  were. She has no clue. I guessed the bacon maple (that was kind of easy with the bacon sprinkles). The rest she has no idea. I ended up choosing a chocolate one which I think had some hint of heat in it. There was no real chocolate flavour and I was trying to discern the other flavour nipping at my palate. But the dryness of the doughnut just over whelmed any further investigation.   Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst cup of coffee I have had all year. Ordered the drip...terrible. Not the way to start the day."}
{"text":"I've ordered everything off the menu in every co nation seemingly possible. It's all so so good. And very affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this food truck for almost 2 years. It never lets us down & never disappoints! We follow them around to all of their different locations/events/parking lots so that we can get our Short Leash fix! You might call us food-stalkers. We have eaten there during Food Truck Fridays, Public Market Saturdays, in the Stinkweeds parking lot, and at the Willo Home Tour! We have introduced a lot of friends/family and they are all just as smitten as we are. It's basically the most gourmet hot dog you'll ever eat, but the owners are so nice & not at all arrogant about the amazingness of their food. They will even make a point to get to know you by name! I always get the Igby, which is a lovely combination of BBQ sauce, fresh coleslaw with purple cabbage/carrots and blue cheese, all tucked into a warm, toasty piece of naan indian flatbread. I usually pair it with an old-fashioned coca cola in a glass bottle. (Their selection of retro drinks is another great thing about them). My husband is more adventurous than I am, he has tried them all, but his favorite is the Bear, a new addition to their menu that involves both peanut butter and bacon. What more could a man want?  They are the best food truck in Phoenix, and possibly America! Get yourself to Short Leash today!"}
{"text":"The place was good but not great. We went on  a Saturday afternoon and it was not crowded. They have a great selection of dogs. Some were great and some were misses. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed meeting Short Leash last night at Shady's, when Brad tapped me on the shoulder and asked that I move my truck so that he could back the food truck in. Sure glad I did! The choice of Shreiner for their meat provision told me a lot without having to ask. I had a beer hot with custom toppings. Wow what a list! Very fresh and tasty. I believe it was well worth the price of admission. Great food and great people."}
{"text":"I ate there while at the Farmers market downtown, I had the corn dogs, but they were called something cute... SO GOOD! the Jalapeno and cheese dog was amazing!  If you get the chance and you love hotdogs I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These are the best dogs I've ever had, no contest. This place is worth going out-of-your-way for. My favorites are The Lady and The Bear. I recommend getting The Bear with the spicy hot dog, you likely won't find anything so addicting!"}
{"text":"I came here for food truck friday a few weeks ago. It was delicious! I got to choose all of my toppings for cheap- no $1 extra here or there. I love that their dogs are in the flat bread they use, it's yummy and more efficient than a bun. I'm willing to go out into the phoenix heat for these hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Well I live across the street so clearly I frequent this place and their delicious iced vanilla lattes. I've had a couple donuts but the apple fritter destroys everytime. So worth every cent, every wait in line. Try everything you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"After seeing this food truck sitting at the Phoenix Farmer's Market, I finally decided to give it a shot.  Boy was it worth it!  When you walk up to the truck, the menu seems small but there are a ton of options.  First, there are four different types of hot dogs to choose from as well, all from Schreiner's Meats: regular dog, all-beef dog, beer-hot dog, or bratwurst (or veggie dog, for those that dislike meat).   Then, you have to choose one of the four different types of hot dog styles, and I chose the \"Moki\" combination.  This winner had green chilis, onions, tomatoes, pinto beans, and cheddar cheese.  It was delicious!  (Fear not, if none of the combinations match your desires, you can create your own custom combination).  The toppings were generous, so much so that the hot dogs are served on fry bread and not hot dog buns.  In addition to being plentiful, the toppings are top-notch.  They are fresh and delicious.   Overall, this was an excellent hot dog experience.  Everything was made to order and in a relatively timely matter.  While waiting, I conversed with the owners inside the truck, and they were extremely friendly and nice.  This was an excellent visit and a delicious lunch.  I will be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest.  If you hate donuts, we can't be friends.  Of all the food holidays we celebrate in this great United States of America, arguably the one we celebrate more enthusiastically than any other is National Donut Day (or doughnut depending on your preference).  I mean c'mon, donuts are basically perfect.  Sweet, savory, soft, warm, decadent deliciousness.  Its our greatest excuse for having dessert at breakfast time (or anytime for that matter).  The creators of Short Leash Hot Dogs had been experimenting with donuts for awhile, but it's only been recently that they've decided to take their donut concept to a stand-alone operation.  In addition to a food truck, Rollover has opened a small full time stand right next door to Oven & Vine on Vernon Street just west of Central Avenue.  With that, I made my way here on Donut Day Friday.  The menu was pretty much as advertised on their website as they had about a dozen different types of donuts to choose from.  I wanted to try them all, but in the interest of my cholesterol I kept it at just a half dozen this time around (though I got an extra for free for donut day).  I got a couple of strawberry glazed, a couple of the coffee cake donuts, a cinnamon and sugar, an orange glaze with pistachios, and the Bear as my free donut (a peanut butter filled donut topped with gouda, crackerjacks, bacon, and a hint of BBQ sauce).  Total price for the donuts including tax came to about $12.  A little pricey, but then again these donuts are a bit more artisan than your run of the mill donuts.    The verdict?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes (use your own When Harry Met Sally sound effects here).  Everyone of the donuts was warm and fresh and had a very liberal amount of glaze.  I've had the Bear before at Short Leash Hot Dogs for dessert so I knew that one was awesome.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but after trying each, my favorites were the most simple offerings I got.  The strawberry glaze and the cinnamon and sugar ones.  Just the right amount of sweetness and portion to enjoy blissfully.  The Coffee Cakes were probably my least favorite (I don't drink coffee so the coffee custard was a little different), but they were still quite delicious.  Next time I'm here I'll probably give the Maple Bacon and Chocolate Chip donuts a whirl.  A quick tip if you're coming here.  If possible, walk or ride your bike here instead of driving.  Parking is a little scarce and it seems like the businesses nearby restrict their lots to their own patrons only.  As a result, your only option is the street and the overflow from the Tapestry condos makes that challenging.  Lots of places around to park your bike though.  Overall a cool little spot.  Much like Short Leash, Rollover keeps the physical scale of their operation small, but with a menu full of tasty options to select from.  Whether its National Donut Day or a regular workday, you're bound to find a donut you'll like at Rollover.  Now excuse me while I rollover from my donut coma."}
{"text":"Very good hot dog (had the bear). Was definitely skeptical for the 8 dollar price tag but definitely plenty of food. Also they sell donuts there which are amazing, definitely have to try the maple bacon donut."}
{"text":"Ode to Short Leash.  I once heard a whisper of a much beloved hot dog; of island dreams come alive atop a six inch bun. I dared not believe there could be another to even compare against my precious.   I feel as a guilty lover drifted away from his one true love in a moment of weakened convictions. The hot peppers and spicy caribbean sauce left me breathless and weak in the knees. As a guilty lover always does, he comes crawling back from rediscovery of what he once knew to be true. Short Leash's love is ever lasting, and how dare I even consider another.   I have faith in our bond; Short Leash, and our ties are not easily broken. I regret even the consideration that there could be another out there to quench the lunchtime desires for hot dog delights. I promise I shall not stray again, with a conviction of the strength of stone.  From hence forth, I promise to remain faithful to the lovingly topped gourmet hot dogs. Available with sauerkraut, cole slaw, pepperoncini's, jalapeños, mango chutney, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, diced tomatoes, fried pickles, grilled onions, peanut butter, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, blue cheese, green chilis, smoked gouda, relish, bacon and barbeque sauce.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, don't stray far from your one true love."}
{"text":"Awesome A MUST TRY! great addition to the Phx food scene."}
{"text":"I work close by, so I decided to try since it has good reviews.  I was just not impressed with this place.  The pretzel dog had way too much salt. It was gross. The donut was stale took one bite and threw it in the trash. I have had several friends try the donuts and toss them out too. The place itself is nice, staff was friendly.  If the food was better the price would totally be worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Simply amazing.  This is the Poutine.  Brat on Naan bread with fries, cheese curds, and gravy.   Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"It does not get better than this.  I'm not one for hot dogs, so I always opt for the chicken dog. They have some crazy combinations that are absolutley fabulous. The pita bread they use for the bun puts it above the rest. It's different for sure, but so worth the money. It's filling for sure!  They feature a dog of the week sent in by customers which is pretty cool.  I never thought anything gourmet could be sold out of a truck, but Short Leash proved me wrong!"}
{"text":"Just got back into town and still on east coast time.  Thankfully, Rollover is open somewhat early and one of the few in the area (that I would consider) on the weekends.  So I tried the Mayokoba.  Their own chocolate, cinnamon and other secret ingredients potion.  It was good enough that I went back and asked for another concoction, this time included cayenne pepper.  First sip had a bit of a kick that worried me if I would need an antacid before I was finished with the cup, but it ended well.  Now, on to the doughnuts. Decisions, decisions.   Plethora of flavors does not begin to describe what is found behind the front window and I was very fortunate to talk to the creator of the bundles of joyful dough. Talk about someone that loves the work and it shows.   Coconut Thai was amazing.   The second day's visit was the chocolate with spiced walnuts. If you like the chocolate doughnut - you won't go wrong with this one.  Lastly, I left them with the suggestion of having a sampler plate.  If that's available on your visit, you have me to thank."}
{"text":"Wow.  It had been a long time since I was so excited to try something.  Our original dinner plan was to order Chinese from China Village & run across the street for a drink at Shady's while we waited.  We lucked out big time!  The parking lot of China Village was full, so we went right to Shady's and were introduced to Short Leash.  All it took was one look at the menu and I knew I would be hooked.  I was tossed up between the Aiko (mango chutney, jalapenos, red onions, fresh cilantro and mayo) or the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions and fried pickles) - but went with the lady.  I have not stopped thinking about the deliciousness of that dog since it touched my lips.    Speaking of fried pickles - I have always loved them, but the fried pickles from Short Leash were hands down the best fried pickles I have ever had.  I need to find out what they put in their batter to give it the spice and crispiness that lasted through the entire meal - no soggy pickles in the end.    So if you're a hotdog fan or even if you're not (they will convert you!) find them on Facebook, track them down in the Valley and get some goodness!!"}
{"text":"Just ok...cute atmosphere, friendly staff, but really nothing special about the donuts.  I was expecting a lot more, I guess!"}
{"text":"Had a hot dog with mango salsa it was in a pita bread type roll it was messy and totally delicious and all fresh no preservatives. It was on a first Friday outside sage, lots of artists there was great fun!"}
{"text":"hots dogs arent spectacular but i like how they use flatbread instead of bun.  you can request for a bun if youd like. had the aiko and corn pups (jalapenos and cheese inside corn dog batter) which was ok.  couldve been more spicy.  they are really friendly and nice so i gave 4 stars went on a fri and sat but i prefer saturday cause theres a mini farmers mkt around which local produces, etc"}
{"text":"My experience was fantastic! We went to the truck at four peaks brewery...what a great idea! I tried 3 different hot dogs and all were amazing...my favorite being the bear....that peanut butter and Gouda are to die for! Everyone was so friendly and added to the experience. I wish I lived in Phoenix because \"Short peaks\" is definitely a place I would go on the reg."}
{"text":"his was my first time eating here.  I had the Igby  on a spicy dog.  Very tasty.  Great coleslaw and blue cheese.  Quick, and a friendly staff.  I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I love this food truck! The owners are super friendly and the hot dogs are always awesome."}
{"text":"I was reading the reviews on yelp and excited to try it out.  Was super happy when I saw the food van at Phoenix Public Market on a Saturday.  I got the vegetarian dog Igby style (BBQ sauce, slaw and blue cheese crumbles).  It is wrapped in the softest, warm, delicious flat bread.  Something in it was a bit to spicy for me - not sure if it was the BBQ sauce or the slaw that was spicy.  I also tried the vegetarian corn dog.  Basically hot pepper jack cheese dipped in corn meal batter and deep fried.  I didn't care for it much at all.  Either did my daughter.  (And we really like a similar thing from Hot Dog on a Stick at the mall).  I am super excited that they have veggie dogs and can't wait to try another combination.  YUM!"}
{"text":"The breakfast special has hit my taste buds and is being digested as I write this! I am so happy that I woke my arse up early this Saturday to get down to the Phoenix Public Market to try SLD. For a mere $5 I got what a lot of people will call a gourmet hot dog, but what I would call an ingenious new take on American street food. It was filling, flavorful and a perfect way to start my day. Not only that, but the owners were super friendly and happy too chat with me!   Do yourself a flavor and read the other reviews on Yelp, look them up on Facebook, find their schedule and be at their next location to get yourself a damn-good dog. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I want to update this review. The owner of Short Leash called me and told me the whole story. It seems it WAS Ubers fault. They picked up my order but left half of it there and pretended it was Short Leash that was at fault. Not the case! Brad has made everything right by me and he gets FIVE stars from me. Shame on Uber!!!! I highly recommend Short Leash, try them today you will be in good hands with them."}
{"text":"Short Leash, hmmm, what can i say. If you love dogs, hot dogs and food in general, this place is the only way to go. Look them up on facebook, get heir calendar and follow them around. My wife and I love them, great food, awesome people, what else can you ask for. Price is awesome, but quality is waaaaay better. Get an awesome meal at SIT-STAY and end the week in good company. Enjoy and stay safe"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing tasting donuts I have ever had! The pistachio Thai coconut orange glaze donut is amazing! The staff was very friendly. New donut shop for sure."}
{"text":"Really cool place that offers some very unconventional hotdogs - mine had peanut butter, bacon, and cracker jacks on it, served in naan.  Yep, you read all of that correctly - it defies logic but was oddly delicious.   The brain said No but the mouth said Yes.  They also have a small selection of decent beers.   It's very unique food that's delicious, and the service was good as well.  I'm not sure I could eat here very single day (sometimes a guy's just gotta have a burger) but my first trip there was so good I did find myself trying to get right back the next day."}
{"text":"Step out of your box and give something new a try, Short Leash is your opportunity to give a hot dog a chance. I experienced the Bear my first time at the truck, now I'm on a mission to try them all.  Fun, friendly service. Small, but fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just saw Short Leash Dogs on Eat St. (Cooking channel) and had to try it for myself.  I had the Oliver with a beef hotdog and my husband had the Aiko with the spicy beer hotdog.  I wish I had taken a picture but they were so damn good they were gone in less than 5 min (don't judge).  Who needs a stupid hot dog bun when you can have your dog wrapped in naan?! Pure genius.  We also couldn't resist the fried pickles--my pregnant lady dream come true :). Can't wait to stop by their new restaurant once its open!"}
{"text":"Downtown Phx holds a lot of hidden gems, and this is definitely one of them. I am not a fan of hot dogs so I was a bit skeptical about this place. Gladly, I was surprised. The naan instead of the hot dog bun transforms the whole meal. I hardly want to call it a hot dog! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They offer a great twist on good local made hot dogs. Who needs a bun anyways? Try the the Igby, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Still phenomenal, and if you get to the truck at around 11:40am on Fridays the line is not too bad. The Igby is by far the best dog they have available."}
{"text":"I always get naked veggie dogs with lots of saurkraut, gouda, banana peppers, tomatoes and mustard! It's amazing.   If you haven't had their fried pickels, it's a MUST!   I work in North Scottsdale so I get very excited when they will be in the Whole Foods parking lot, however I only made the mistake of going at noon once. I spent almost an hour in line, but it was sooo worth it."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!!!! Must try if you're in phoenix"}
{"text":"Holy.crap.  The best, ever.  I LOVE THEIR HOT DOGS!  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!  I could eat their hot lady dog everyday forever and be happy.  A delicious spicy hot dog, on a naan bread, topped with chipotle cream cheese and all sorts of other delicousness.  SO GOOD!  I should have gotten two.  One to eat, one to go."}
{"text":"It's all about the bread and what is around the dog, not the dog it self.  I finally made it down to the mobile food court on a Friday and was not distracted by another truck.  I oped for a veggie Moki A veggie dog with into beans, cheese green chillies and a mayo based sauce. What made it was the great soft flat bread and the toppings as the veggie dog it self was a bit bland and had no character.   As I side I went with an order of veggie corn pups. Which are balls of cheese covered in con batter and fried, all on a stick, they are heavenly.  All of this for $7  I tried some of my friends fried pickles. They were just too sweet.  Check them out at this location most Fridays from 11-1"}
{"text":"Hot digity dog!!! Fun place loaded with character and great food.  Great staff and vibe.  We had the \"Lady\" and the \"Aiko\" with all beef hot dog (there are other options) and couple sides... fries (order extra crispy...simple but awesome crunchy and soft in the middle) and mac'n'cheese (over the top creamy goodness). Will definitely be back to try the \"Bear\" and the \"Crispy Dog\".  a few craft brews. This place is 100% a WEINER!"}
{"text":"Hyped up hot dog?  I'm traveling from the other side of town...waaaaay East!  I picked up hubby from work to enjoy a nice lunch downtown.  There were about 5 food trucks to choose from.  I came especially for the wieners.  I had the Lady, hubby got the Aiko and my little cutie wanted the Corn Pup (corn dog) with relish on the side.  I prefer dogs with natural casings that lend a crunch to the bite.  Love the chipotle mayo and deep fried pickle topping.  Naan bread to hold the yummy stuff is very clever.  Hubby seemed to enjoy his order.    \"This is spicy!  Too much pepper!!!\"  as my little guy guzzled water down his mouth.  Just FYI if your kids do not like any heat on their food!    I'll get him a regular hot dog next time.  It is the best hot dog I've had in AZ so far. Now I get what the hype is about!   We will be back to tackle some of the other 50 toppings!"}
{"text":"I've had Rollover doughnuts bookmarked since it opened and you have no idea the excitement that aroused when I saw that it was right next to the salon I just started to go to. Like a little girl, I was giddy and big-eyed to walk up to the cute little window with a stunning display of doughnuts. I stood there for awhile trying to decide what to try. Boy, it wasn't easy. I wanted to get them all but I knew that I shouldn't. I went with the strawberry glazed and their featured doughnut of the week - cookies & cream. Oh wow. Their doughnuts are so fluffy and soft. I could tell the strawberry glaze was made with so much love and the filling in the C&C was amazing - perfectly creamy and not too sweet. Essentially a cookie in cream form, lol. I hope they make this one often. So good. This is what I love about local businesses. Although I may not have been eating the most fresh doughnuts at 2pm, they were quality to me. I picked up a bag of their dog treats for my pup - $1/2. She loved them! They have a small counter/bar with water available for you to enjoy your doughnuts as well as a cute studio next door with places where you can sit or do some work.  I'm not sure if Short Leash food truck is always parked there but they were when I came in. I am loving downtown Phoenix more and more because of gems like these."}
{"text":"Short Leash usually has a surcharge for coming to your facility, but as it turned out they were just finishing an event near our church on the day of our gathering, so they came to us with no additional surcharge and the promise of 20 people.  Many of the people attending were physically challenged, so I played waiter and the entire event was well received.  These guys will work with you, and our experience was very good.  The food had good reviews too."}
{"text":"The veggie dog was good but I probably would not order again. I mean, I'm not much of a hot dog girl to begin with so maybe I'm biased and unAmerican--completely possible.  At any rate... they are crazy friendly and it's a great place but just not for me."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a hotdog! Love the lavash bread and every topping you can imagine! I went a little crazy with the sriracha last time, though :)"}
{"text":"YES, YES, YES!!! My brother and I were in Phoenix for the week (unfortunately our father had a stroke...but is doing much better now) from San Diego. We saw several catering trucks parked at a farmers market on Wed night and popped in.  So glad we did! I had a dog with mango chutney and other yummies.  Serving them on flat bread... Genius!!!! My brother ordered the corn dog.  The breading actually tasted like corn!  The owners couldn't have been more friendly and outgoing.  When they told us of their breakfast dog on Sat mornings....  We happened to still be in town on Sat and it was a given that we'd be going back!  Breakfast was insane!!!!  We took one to go for our family at the hospital.  All in all, utterly fantastic. If I should be in Phoenix again, you can bet I will make it a point to seek out Short Leash!  Thanks again, -John from San Diego"}
{"text":"The best Hot Dogs around bar none! So many different hot dogs to choose from and the toppings are pretty much unlimited. So far the Igby has been my favorite, but next time I so have to add fried pickles to it! Try them out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Short Leash and I are one. Brad and Katherine are super nice and you cant go wrong with anything u order.  Recommendation: Torn between 2? ask then to split a dog. Also, Try the fried pickles at least once in your life.  FYI: you ever get a chance to try the SUNNY, do it!!! thats my pup!"}
{"text":"Can you say strong comeback?  The first time I went here, I didn't like it. There was too much bread and not enough filling. Maybe that was because I got it to go? Anyways the flavors were good but the bread overtook everything because there was just too much of it.  I had been working and hadn't ate all day aka I was hungry AF. I had to stop somewhere so I decided to give this place a second chance. Wow? Was I right to do so! I ordered the bear dog and it was awesome! The bread was not overwhelming because they had put enough toppings on it to fill the tray. It was delicious! I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise at the Mesa Arts Festival!  I have been dreaming of a place to get a veggie dog with interesting and mouth watering toppings for as long  as I can remember!  I was a little surprised when I was handed my dog wrapped in pita bread, but it was better than a bun. I will be tracking this one down again and again!"}
{"text":"Two words people: FRIED PICKLES..   The fried pickles are literally what sent me over the moon.. they were nicely battered, fried to a perfect crisp.. and were juicy, spicy, sweet, and super addicting..  They were my favorite thing about Short Leash...   Now onto their amazing dogs... I ended up getting the March Special, it had cajun potato salad, bacon, and a spicy bratwurst.. soo delicious but definitely not healthy (if that it all even matters!). I honestly cannot remember what other things were in it.. but if you are in line right now trying to decide what to get.. like I was, please go with the fried pickles for $3.00, and try the March Special.. theres a picture of a cute white bichon frise on the food truck window that explains what the March special is, if that helps you out!"}
{"text":"I sought this out because Yelp caught my eye with it being on their \"Best of Yelp Phoenix Restaurants\" so I made a deliberate drive to get there, ate what I though was representative and think Yelp has this one wrong.  First of all Yelp, it isn't a restaurant that you claim but a food truck, a very small food truck.  But I had read the Yelp reviews and knew that.  I stepped up and had trouble finding the ordering line through the people.  While there wasn't a big group ordering, about 6 people were clustered around blocking the window, apparently waiting for their orders to appear.  Turns out it would be a long wait, but good things are worth waiting for, right? I sorted through those waiting, politely asked and found there was no line and made my way to the window.   I ordered the Beef Moki and because of the positive Yelp comments, added a side of fried pickle.  Total was $8 without a drink (I got one of the fruit drinks at the other trucks there).    Window guy said it would be about 7 mins, which caused me to look at my Droid - 1:22PM.   At 1:38PM my Moki arrived but there was a few minutes more wait for the fried pickle which wasn't ready yet.  Took 20 mins total and this was well past peak lunch hour.    Sat down and looked at what I got (see photos I took).  Other Yelpers are right, the dog is small. The Moki is listed as having green chilis, onions, tomatos, pinto beans, cheddar & mayo. I was anticipating a nice SouthWestern style blend of flavors, but that was absent.  I bit in and none of these flavors jumped out, no chili heat, no flavor burst, no taste of fresh veggies melding.   What I did get was a sensation of the tough skin texture of the dog, very thick naan bread and a pinto bean absorbtion.  Turning to the fried pickle, its breading kept falling off just leaving the limp, soggy pickle.  I finished the 7 pieces of fried pickle that I had paid $3 for and wondered why the ratings were so high.    The dining area I sat in was very windy, blowing fiercely which made the experience forced; a hand off between eating and holding down anything that I had ordered.  Hours later, my iron stomach is still getting belch tones from the dog's meat spices and oil based aromas.   This isn't good.  Unless you're working right across the street and this place was the utmost in convenience, I'd pass.  The flavors didn't work or even stand out, the service was incredibly slow, and the eating area was dumpy and windy.  Spending $8 for \"a dog and pickles\" then add an additional cost of a drink beyond that, you are already at sit down restaurant prices found elsewhere nearby.    I just don't see what the ravings are all about at this place.  Heck, I saw a Pita Jungle a few blocks before and wondered why I would pass that up to come here.  SIDE NOTE - I went back and read some of the prior Yelp reviews.  I just don't get how reviewers are giving this place such high ratings. Here is a review that rated 4 stars but stated it was only held back from 5 stars because;  -small dog,  -undercooked naan,  -toppings flavors don't fuse together,  -neglected service,  -overpriced http://www.yelp.com/biz/short-leash-dogs-phoenix#hrid:_FrRd1SiaPMV5-sIcTWu1A wtf - Yelp, you've let me down."}
{"text":"Have to add my fine regards to this little truck.  I had the \"Devil Dog\" and it was indeed fairly spicy.  And I'm the guy in my group who loves it \"so hot my face sweats\" so when I say something is fairly spicy, it's not going to be for the faint of tongue.  Good bargain for what you get.  The Naan bread made for a \"different\" kind of \"Hot Dog\" for sure.  All the fillings were fresh and added to the overall taste instead of getting overpowered by any one ingredient.  I'll definitely hit this truck again in the future.  Good Job !!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying out Short Leash Dogs at Ignite 10. I had a bratwurst slider. The slider was a bratwurst  served on a pretzel roll with sauerkraut and cheese. That combination was awesome. It was the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and salty.  The sauerkraut was the best I have had since I visited Germany. It was sweet and in combination with the cheese the slider just melted in my mouth. When I think of sliders I think of small portions, but this one was rich and filling. I highly recommend Short Leash Dogs. I can't wait to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Pros:    Excellent Hot Dogs    Good Prices    Superior Service Cons:    Why can't they open up next to my house? :)"}
{"text":"I've unearthed hot dog Nirvana!  I've been Yelping on and off for about nine months and during that time never --- I say NEVER ---  have given five stars to any restaurant.  Much to my surprise and delight, I've found the perfect quick serve meal in the most unlikely of places: a food truck!  The local food trucks and specifically, Short Leash, have had their fair share of \"ink\" recently and I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me.  The long line in the hot Phoenix weather during last week's Food Truck Friday was long forgotten once I bit into a \"Regular\" (pictured) with \"Lady\" toppings.  The hot dog was cooked to perfection with it's slightly crispy casing and flavorful meatiness.  I had no idea it would be served on naan, but loved the soft, light freshness of it all.  And the toppings?  The Lady includes Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed Onions and fried Pickles ... all of which created a wonderful combination of flavors, though did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  I was so impressed with Short Leash that I made a point of visiting again THE VERY NEXT DAY!  This time it was The Chicken (pictured) with Aoki toppings (Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo) which blew me away.  Whoever came up with these flavor combinations is a genius!  And as for the staff, let me just say that they are genuinely THE nicest people around or deserve an Academy Award.  (And remember, they're working hard in the heat, ya know!)  Thank you, Short Leash, for doing it right.  I'll undoubtedly be back for more hot dogs --- and smiles.  But don't worry, I won't complain about the long line.  ;)"}
{"text":"Their truck was invited to my office event and there was a long line to go with their reputation for churning out tasty, unique dogs.  Soooo good, sooo different, snappy dogs.  Made to order but worth the wait. Too bad they are not located in Tempe in their own brick n mortar.  So it is a special treat to see them at an event."}
{"text":"Delicious food cart.    The spicy beer hot dog is the best.    They messed up my order and gave me the wrong version of the right dog and it was delicious.  I wanted  Aiko (mango chutney) but I got the Oliver.    I did not give it five stars because its more expensive than it should be.  However, the people keep lining up."}
{"text":"Unleash your hot dog inhibitions and enjoy a fresh, local take on a time honored street food.  The Na an bread bun is a stroke of genius and their commitment to sourcing their food locally will definitely endear themselves to the locals.  My only complaint?  That they'd expand their coverage and set up shop closer to home."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with delicious donuts. I got the cookie dough and the peanut butter pretzel donut. I will return to Phoenix just for those. They also have uno at every table which i thought was acute touch"}
{"text":"First timer.   I've always wanted to try this food truck, so the annual Fall Fest at Hance Park provided me the perfect opportunity to do just that.   My friend had told me just how good the hot dogs this truck offers are & he wasn't kidding! He had the Oliver; I had the Igby. We each got an order of 2 Roll Over donuts: Cookie Dough & Chocolate with sprinkles.   I am not a sauerkraut fan at all but my friend is & loved his Oliver. He has ordered that one a few times now since he likes it so much. I really enjoyed the Igby. It has great flavor and with the coleslaw, barbecue sauce, & bleu cheese, the blend of flavors was heavenly!   The Roll Over donuts were okay; a bit sweet for my liking, but good nonetheless.   I will DEFINITELY do Short Leash again! You guys have not seen/heard the last of me or my friend Mark."}
{"text":"The BEST!! I crave these hot dogs, especially The Lady. All around outstanding service and food. Go try them!"}
{"text":"Although not prepared like your common hot-dog, Short Leash Dogs have a unique fresh taste that really makes them stand out."}
{"text":"The hot dogs we ordered we're sufficiently awesome and reasonable priced. Great craft beers and nice service."}
{"text":"Finally made it last night 30 minutes before they close! only to discover they had an unexpected lunch rush and had run out of bread... They apologized profusely and said that to make up for it, they'd cut up the dog, give me double the meat and mix it all up into more of a bowl-like situation. I had wanted to get the Oliver (Reuben-esque), but when I heard there was no bread I opted for the Aiko which has red onion, jalapeno, mango... It was good And spicy! I also picked up a Miko for the roommate which looked tasty and she didn't seem to have any complaints. Dogs are $5. I think Maui dog is a better deal for what you get.  Was glad to hear that they set up shop at Shady's on Thursdays until 11pm so I'll have to give them another shot over there sometime."}
{"text":"Awesome hang out. Awesome service. Awesome food. Not much parking though. Great location nonetheless."}
{"text":"Imagine every hot dog you've ever had. Ok, now throw every image out the window because you haven't tasted anything until you've had a hot dog from Short Leash Dogs.   Everything I heard about Short Leash Dogs is true and today I finally got to experience one. I visited Short Leash Dogs during their Pop-Up lunch at 335 W. McDowell today (a location which is pretty cool and I can't wait to see what it becomes, by the way).   I studied the menu and had major menu anxiety while trying to figure out what to order. I wanted my first Short Leash dog to be perfect! I noticed that the special was called the \"Sunny.\" It has peaches, goat cheese and prosciutto. They told me that it's only on the menu for a limited time, so of course I had to order it, especially since it has everything I love in life on it!   I anxiously awaited my order and envisioned the luscious flat-bread engulfed in the goat cheese and prosciutto on top of the hot dog. It finally appeared and it took just one bite for me to be in a scene of \"All Dogs Go To Heaven.\" I got the chicken hot dog and it was seasoned perfectly. The flat-bread complimented the meat and toppings and the prosciutto, peaches and goat cheese were the perfect summery twist on this hot day.   After my visit to Short Leash, I decided that I will tie my leash to their food cart and follow them religiously around town. Not only are the owners two of the nicest people around, but their hot dogs are an extremely tasty addition to the Valley.   Now if only Old Town allowed more food carts to post up shop. You'd think with the amount of bar and foot traffic, they would want gourmet food carts like Short Leash!"}
{"text":"ooooh, sweet baby, come to momma! the first dog i tried at Short Leash was the Lady: Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed onions, and fried pickles. at first bite, the song resounded in my mind: \"Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling. Give me all your love. Your hands build me up when I'm sinking. Touch me and my troubles all fade,\" and i'm not even a Styx fan (sorry, not sorry). it's just *that* good.   but wait! listen, linda, lookit honey honey. you MUST try the Bear. with Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, Smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce, how can you go wrong?! you can't! just do it! i did it, and i'll do it again."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars because of the friendly service, originality, quick service & most of all, their indoor seating.  I had a iced chai tea latte which was good. I also had a coffee cake donut with coffee cream filling. That was delicious as well.  Nothing here wow'd me as much as the indoor space did.  I wish they were opened later hours because they offer such a great indoor study/work/hangout place. They have games, free wifi. Their chai tea latte & coffee cake donut were delicious. Just a good spot, overall.  Final thoughts: yes, it's worth checking out. I've read in other reviews that they tend to run out of the \"good\" donuts towards their closing hours. It makes sense. Luckily for me, I came 2-3 hours before closing and still got me a cool donut! Also.... not a single person walked into their indoor seating area so I had it all to myself for 2-3 hours. If you need to get work done at earlier hours of the day. Come here. They even have free wifi! It's cool, nice, and really quiet :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered twice through GrubHub. Both times the food made me I'll. Got the wrong donuts both times & food made me seriously sick."}
{"text":"Outstanding food...best Arnold Palmer I've ever had!!! No wonder they have so many awards!  Def will be coming back to try the whole menu...deep fried pickles are where it's at."}
{"text":"Finally a hot dog with a snap in it's bite! The true sign of a good dog.  We enjoyed the Aiko and Moki, both were delicious, the mango chutney was a perfect little sweet compliment to the meaty hot dog.  The flat bread is a great idea because you can really wrap this guy up and enjoy it as you walk around the market! Price was right, I mean $5 for a hot dog might seem a bit high for some but this is a BIG DOG! definitely worth it.  The only criticism I might have is that we had one person come up to us when we were going to order and ask us if they sold dog food in the truck... I guess because of the big dog painted on it with a short leash! LOL! but seriously it was a great gourmet style hot dog! We'll be back to try some other combinations! P.S- The extra touch to remember our names while we were there was nice! Good clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place has the most creative hot dog combos I've ever seen. Kinda disappointed in myself though. First time here and I went with the weekly special which was pretty much a chili dog. I asked for jalapeños on the side but the were all chopped up inside the chili so it was a little too hot for my mom's taste who was splitting it with me. I know I'll be back for another round & think I'll get adventurous & try the lady dog. Oh and in the way to the bathroom te have the cutest wall filled with photos of customers dogs & names of the people who love them, too cute!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs for breakfast??? Oh yes, my friends... You must try the Breakfast Special during the Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market on Saturday!  Scrambled eggs with chopped up hot dogs, mushrooms, a little salsa, and a few other yummy ingredients- all nestled in a pita. Lots of flavor with a little kick that made my taste buds sing! And a portion size enough for two meals- or one if you're hungry. Good price, too. If they're busy, order one and shop around- it doesn't take too long anyway, but also gives you a chance to explore the rest of the Market. It's not on the menu, so ask for it! (Also loved the little lollipop surprise in with the to-go box!)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of this place I knew I had to try it!    The \"Bear\" sounded like it was right up my alley.  And let me tell you...  it did not disappoint!  The peanut butter, smoked Gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce, and cracker jacks that accompanied that spicy beer hot on naan bread, was just amazing!  A true palate pleaser!!!    I also tried poutine fries for the first time.  The gravy and cheese curds atop fresh fries is another awesome creation.  I can't believe I never tried them before.  The service is great and the food is BOMB!    If you're in the Phoenix area and you're a hot dog fan at all; you've got to give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Scooby snacks for Ivy, our dog. Bacon maple,  goat cheese blueberry holes,  coconut and coffee cake filling delights and an apple fritter for us.  Wow.. The young man was a delight to all 3 of us AND THEIR INDOOR PET FRIENDLY SITTING AREA IS AWESOME."}
{"text":"I love food trucks.  Short Leash does it really well.  The signage is a little confusing but basically for about $5 bucks you can get a great meal.  Customize a dog with pita bread and fill up.  I like to go on Fridays and follow up my meal with some ice cream from Sweet Republic.  Lunch for under ten buck, both me and my stomach are happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome little stand. It's all outdoor, casual seating so don't expect it to be anything more. I had the Orange pistachio donut and tried the bear. Loved the first one and the second was ok. Can't wait to make it a regular morning stop."}
{"text":"Dry but oil heavy dough. Not sweet. Look delicious but are not at all. Received wrong mix of doughnuts than what I ordered. So disappointed after ordering a half dozen of these. Just flavorless. They did arrive quickly though."}
{"text":"Stop today for doggies they were very good. A little different serve on a flat bread \"pita style\".   Pro: Good many combination to order Con: A little pricey \" 2 dogs, potatoes chips and drink  $ 16.00 total          Off a lunch truck for the that price.          No seating, or tables          A steep price for a hot dog"}
{"text":"There has been plenty said already about this crazy hot dog wagon ~ Short Leashed Dogs, and most of it true!  Their hot dog creations are  creative, tasty and just freaking awesome!  Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.  Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.    I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalapeños, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.  They have bottled H2O and soda in bottles. I found the diet black cherry goes well with any hot dog. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations around town.  Look them up on FB, find them and enjoy a creative and delicious bite to eat."}
{"text":"A small little trailer hauling a huge load of Flavor, Short Leash has become an instant favorite of mine, and on your fist bite, will be one of yours as well.  I love their food, and Short Leash shows in their handcrafted selections that they Love serving it even more.  They'd make a Jewish Person give up being Kosher.  A Muslim give up being Halal.  A Vegetarian take down a cow with their teeth and bare hands to help provide beef for the sausages!  I first sampled their scrumptious Jalapeno Cheese Corn Dogs and their ever so savory Spicy Beer Beef sausage at a Yelp Play Date at the Phoenix Children's Museum.  Immediately I sprung into action, liking them on Facebook  and following on Twitter so that I could stalk this cart of deliciousness wherever they went like a psychotic ex-girlfriend.  Fast Forward to last Friday Night at their weekly Sit and Stay behind Stinkweeds on Central and Camelback..  My Wife decided on the tried and true Jalapeno Cheese Corn Dogs and I tried the Moki Dog.  This decadent dog, is loaded with roasted green chilies, sauteed onions, fresh tomatoes, pinto beans, cheddar cheese and mayo, then served on a warm flatbread instead of a bun,  Also, upon my wrapped dog came a spicy pickle slice that smacked my taste buds around and made them it's bitch.  I was tempted to order a whole mess of them as a side.  Then I moved to the sausage in question.  Upon my first bite of the Moki... instant Foodgasm!  The Spicy Beer Beef was my sausage of choice and I can definitively say that any other way is just Blasphemy and you should be beaten with reeds should you deviate.  But that's just my opinion.  Since that last bite on Friday continuing through to these past few days, I've been wanting a Moki Dog so badly that I'd fistfight a Nun, a rabbi, a priest, an imam and my own grandmother if any of them got the last one!  Thankfully, Short Leash keeps a detailed schedule of where they will be and makes sure to alert their Facebook and Twitter followers to any special events and menu items.  So, getting another dog shouldn't require an ecclesiastical or familial melee.   I could go broke following Short Leash, and be happy for it.  But, Short Leash is so amazingly priced for what you get, that it won't break the bank hounding them for their Treats Of Ultimate Tastiness.  If you haven't already tried them... drop what you are doing this moment, get that browser opened to http://shortleashhotdogs.com/, find where they are today and start a line NOW!  If I could give them 10 stars, I'd still bitch that it wasn't enough.  Sit.  Stay.  Good Dogs!"}
{"text":"Went to Four Peaks Tasting Room's grand opening and I knew I had to try this place.  They have a hot dog called \"The Bear\".  it has bacon, barbeque, gouda (sounding good right...just wait this is the weird part), peanut butter, and cracker jack.  Okay now I am intrigued and stay with me people! I nervously waited in the endless line which included some weirdos who were not in the line just standing by it to confuse everyone.  I was still questioning this crazy concoction, but as an adventurous eater I had to try it.  When we FINALLY got to the front I ordered.  They did not have gouda, but no matter I order swiss instead.  They were also out of most of the types of hot dogs, but luckily I just wanted a regular anyway.  Then you stand in a line to wait for your food.  This was lots of time to second guess my sanity on this one, but I am glad I did not. The hot dog was REAL GOOD!  i took it over to where the band was playing (Blueshounds were also a really good addition to my hot dog experience).  WOWZA!  This thing was good!  The dog was served up in naan bread instead of the usual bun.  The salty sweet and spicy combo was unlike anything I have ever tasted and good too!  The peanut butter gave it a kind of pad thai taste and the cracker jack crunch sealed the deal.  This was a winner."}
{"text":"So every time I get off the light rail and walk over to work I aways see this place and today I tried the ginger something tea. It is so good. I am a huge tea head. So I will definitely be coming back. It's literally around the corner from my job. And the people that work there are nice. It's very cute. I suggest that you stop by and try it."}
{"text":"yummmmm! I think this is my favorite donut shop in Phoenix, and not just because of the adorable location.  We tried an assortment of donuts here, but my favorite by far is the orange pistachio - which I was NOT expecting to like. My foodie toddler loved it as well.   The apple fritter was not quite typical - I think it had some cardamom spice to it; not bad, but not what I expected. The maple and bacon was meh.   I love that they have a cute little lawn and a separate little study building too."}
{"text":"WARNING!  Might be offensive to those with no sense of humor!    If I could give 10 dogs...I mean stars I would!  I had heard a lot of good things about this place and figured I'd give it a try...despite the LONGEST line ever.  As we approached the menu I felt this wave of anxiety wash over me.  I mean how many different toppings can you put on a hot dog.  Wait? Did I read that correctly? Cracker Jacks? Peanut Butter? BACON? GOUDA...on the same hot dog?  Um...yummy???    Ok. so I wasn't as adventurous as my best friend...I opted for the spicy beer dog with sauerkraut, spicy mustard, cilantro, jalapenos, tomatoes, and smoked gouda.  Wrapped in not a typical hot dog bun, but in this soft pita type bread.  I was in love.    My best friend went for it though...she ordered THE BEAR!  Beef dog, peanut butter, bbq sauce, smoked gouda, cracker jacks....I took a bite and instantly had weiner envy!  (hehehe)  The peanut butter gave it this asian/thai/korean type of flavor.  It was delicious! Next time I'm going back to have the mango chutney/cilantro dog.    Ok...I know I keep rambling and this review is poorly written, but as I write I keep remembering all of the goodness that goes on in this little food truck.  As for the weiners...(the following has a rating of PG-13 due to some innuendos and connotations that could be inferred) they have that casing that as soon as you put the weiner in your mouth...well, it kinda snaps/pops!  Then all the flavorful goodness just begins to take over your tastebuds and well, I can't speak for everyone here, but I got this warm and fuzzy feeling searing through my body!  I had to take a moment to savor this feeling as I wasn't sure when I would experience it again!  Woooo-sahhhhhh.  This was like being on a date with Shemar Moore...I just wanted to take that dog in my hand and say \"Hey baby girl...how youuuu doin?\"  Ok so I mixed a little Joey Tribiani in there as well!  Anyway...the dude at the window was super friendly and very patient with my inability to just make a damn decision!  The line moved fairly quickly and the wait for the food wasn't long at all!    Oh did I mention that their corn dogs look like a giant fried piece of heaven?  There's always next time...."}
{"text":"OMG! I love this place. My husband and I hope on the Harley's and ride down here from Glendale for donuts. They are so good. I'm not big into donuts, but these are exceptional. But you have to get there early, cuz when they run out, It SUCKS! It's happened to us and we had friends with us that we were bragging to about the donuts. The best place to get a donut."}
{"text":"fantastic gluten free versions of practically everything on the menu. Top notch quality every time I've tried it."}
{"text":"On a nice spring morning I took a trip to the downtown farmers market where I first saw short leash dogs and had my taste buds knocked upside down, now at first I was reluctant as looking at menu with the weird combos and even weirder names I decided to take a chance and will forever be thankful for that decision. The Igby my friends should have a street named after it I would kiss that dog if I met him they start with a delicious flat bread (pita-ish) with your choice of hot dog (spicy, regular or bratwurst) I go with brat they then layer with a fresh coleslaw they add BBQ sauce to it and then layer it with blue cheese I know what ur thinking but trust me it works. I also love the fact that they put a slice of a hot pickle on the top. And the dum dum for dessert is classic."}
{"text":"After a year of wishful thinking, I finally got an opportunity to try this place out; I was not disappointed.  I drug my boyfriend out to the four peaks tasting room where I saw Short leash was set up a couple hours; heck what could be better than beer and hotdogs?!?!?  I ordered the moki and it was soooooo good.  I love that they don't use regular hotdog buns here, instead they opt for naan bread which has way better flavor.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back some time for a second round:)"}
{"text":"Was driving down the street today and looked to my right and was like....OMG SHORT LEASH DOGS!!!! I had been wanting to try this place since forever.   IT DID NOT LET DOWN   I created my own, and I wanted to try everything! The staff was super friendly and they served it up quickly with a long line behind me. I can not wait to find them again."}
{"text":"Umm...YUM! Short Leash is, so far, my favorite food truck and my favorite hot dog in Phoenix!  My favorite is the lady, but I do often try their weekly specials. The owner is always super nice, the food is great and affordable. I suggest that you follow them on twitter and find them at a location near you!"}
{"text":"I love this place because my friends love this place. But take this with a huge grain of salt as I am presumptively opposed to hot dogs. That said, the hotdogs here are very inventive, and there's a rotating hotdog of the week, named after a local pup. They have exciting names that I can't quite remember, but they run the gamut from laden with spicy goodness to laden with sweet goodness. The Bear has peanut butter, jelly, and even cracker jacks. It also happens to be a favorite of most of my friends who go there. Fun fact? The hotdogs are wrapped in naan instead of a bun, which is a huge plus in my book! Get them with chips or a side salad :)  When I come here, as a hot-dog-hater, I love ordering a smorgasboard of apps. This is one of the few places in Phoenix where you can wrangle yourself an order of hushpuppies, and boy are they worth it. They've also got fried pickles, pimento cheese dip, and jalapeno poppers. The jalapeno poppers are pretty spicy and I do not recommend them as a solo meal!  The sneaky bit about Short Leash is their expansive beer menu. I've heard mixed reviews on the mixed drinks (see what I did there?!), but as a beer patron, I can say I'm consistently happy.  Kids would love this place, adults would love this place, I don't even like hot dogs and I'm pretty taken with the joint."}
{"text":"From the reviewer who brought you a stellar review for Short Leash, comes a review for their donut/coffee shop located on Vernon. Now, I completely forgot that they took over Shine, and I was just going to go randomly grab a cup of coffee after my niece was insisting that I needed coffee, she's two years old. lol.  Anyways though, parked right out front was their Short Leash Food Truck, but I wasn't really hungry just yet and was in the mood for coffee. My niece on the other hand, is always hungry, and she wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed a latte which I just told them to make me something sweet, so I wasn't 100% sure what kind it was, but it was awesome. My nieces had the maple glazed donut with candied bacon and she loved it all. They are a little pricey for their donuts, but worth it on an every now and then basis. Coffee/Lattes are priced in comparison with most of the coffee shops around here. Will stop in again, once I have a few extra bucks to spare that is. Next time, I'll have to get the \"bear\" donut."}
{"text":"BEST DOUGHNUTS IN TOWN...in the valley...the state...the country...in the world. Basically it's the best. I had their orange pistachio doughnut and it changed my life. It's a doughier doughnut, and ugh it's so good. I would HIGHLY recommend this place. The workers are super friendly and helpful. GO HERE NOW."}
{"text":"Awesome food truck! A regular at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturday mornings but I run in to them around downtown frequently and the food is consistently excellent. Great and creative hot dogs. I love the Aiko but don't be afraid to create your own with their vast collection of toppings. I just wish they had a chili dog!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I'm super underwhelmed with this one. Ordered corn dogs and the lady hot dog and the actual sausage tasted like a value pack hot dog from the grocery store. They also skimped on toppings and didn't specify that the corn dogs were filled with cheese or that they're extremely small."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck I've tried in the city! The hot dogs are unique, the people working are nice, and you definitely get enough food for $6. Try the Igby!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite food truck in Phoenix.  Everything on their menu sounds amazing, so deciding which dog I would like by the time it's my turn to place my order can sometimes be a challenge. But have no worries. Whatever you order will be delicious. When I'm not feeling adventurous to try something new from the menu, I usually order the Moki with a spicy beer hot dog and a side of fried pickles. Yum!"}
{"text":"Exquisite hot dogs, donuts, coffee and brew. The staff is wonderful. I had a hot dog with pretzels. I was not sure that it would be delicious, but I was impressed by how good it is. An amusing place to eat with excellent food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's over a week now since Yelp office hours met up with Short Leash Dogs at their Pop-Up location on W McDowell.  I can still taste the hot dog I had.  Beef hot dog w/ grilled onions, cheddar cheese and spicy mustard.  I have to say it was better than your average dog.  If you get a chance to catch up with these folks I suggest you do.  They not only make good dogs they are nice people to deal with.  They were even out of the trailer checking on customers as we were eating."}
{"text":"The new restaurant in downtown phoenix is fantastic.  The only drawback is the wait time because my last visit included a forty minute wait.   If you cannot decide which dog to pick try the one with the peanut butter and popcorn."}
{"text":"Went to a Sit Stay UYE Friday night with my daughter & a friend, I had been wanting to try Short Leash Dogs for awhile now, so this opportunity sounded like the perfect time for that!  I found them in an alley way off Central & Camelback, and when I walked up it had a nice cozy feeling, couple of wooden tables, a fire pit and plenty of cool people.  I knew that this would a hot dog eating experience that I haven't had before; I ordered the Pippin Style Brat, came with grilled pears, prosciutto, watercress, goat cheese & topped with some honey & pepper severed on naan bread.   Ok sounds interesting right? Let me tell you, it was amazing, who would have thought, everything blended so well together, what a great treat!  My friend and I had been lil standoffish about the Bear; I just couldn't get my head wrapped around it. Friend asked if I would be up to splitting one, that we came this far and to not try it would just be an epic failure on our behalf, so I said yes!  The Bear, it's interesting, has peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon & bbq sauce on a brat wrapped in naan bread. The peanut butter sort of melts and mixes with the bbq sauce and it kind of reminded me of Thai Peanut sauce, which I just love!   Over all the hot dog was good, just was unsure of what to make of the cracker jacks, would I order another one, Heck yea I would!   Glad to have finally had the chance to try Short Leash, look forward to my next run in with them!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! You are unholy goodness! My favorite hot dog was the Costco Polish Sausage. I've had many other hot dogs, including those New York chili dogs, but this place makes them SUPER unique. My boyfriend and I walked in, looked at the menu, and both agreed to order three to share. We weren't even that hungry!  What we had: -The Sunny: This was our favorite. It's such a refreshing combo of light ingredients. The chicken is amazing, do yourself a favor and do NOT substitute it with any other type of hot dog meat. The pear that was in there gave it some nice crunch and freshness. SO unique. SO GOOD. Will 100% order again. -The Bear: At first I wasn't sure what I was eating. It is a 'salty' dog (doesn't mean that it's too salty though, but that the flavors were more geared toward that). I was really unsure about the Cracker Jack popcorn, but it actually gave it a nice crunch without being distracting! The BBQ sauce gave the entire dog some zest and the peanut butter worked really well with the bacon. It wasn't at all overwhelming. -The Poutine: Very savory. I like the balance of gravy and potatoes. Though it was good, it was my least favorite out of the three. Would I never recommend it? No. I think it was just overshadowed by two other really outstanding hot dogs.  1000% will eat here again!  Also, the nice cashier guy raved about their donuts. I don't even like donuts, but he gave us the last cookie dough donut and IT WAS AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an iced coffee yesterday and it was horrible!! The coffee was extremely bitter!! I ordered a large. Took two sips and threw it out. I thought their coffee would be amazing since I hear good things about their donuts.  Guess it's back to Starbucks for a large iced coffee at $2.80.   So much for supporting local businesses if they can't make a decent cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Super nice folks and wonderful donuts. The lightest, fluffiest yeast-raised donuts I've ever had, and an Apple Fritter that just melted in my mouth. Not a ton of variety (6-10 kinds, so a little less variety than Welcome Donuts), but I don't think you could go wrong with any of them.   If you prefer Dunkin/BoSa/Rainbow donuts to these, then I just can't help you."}
{"text":"Finally saw their truck at The Willo Home Tour event. And I was hungry so I got two dogs: a regular wiener with coleslaw, Swiss and thousand island dressing. The other was called the \"Bear\" and seemed to be named a \"7th inning stretch favorite\" since it included peanut butter, Cracker Jacks and nuts. both very good but would've been better with melted cheese. The warm flatbread is a great touch and allows more toppings to surround the dog.  Service was friendly and efficient. I'll be keeping them on a short leash in the future...and look forward to trying more of their concoctions!"}
{"text":"Two words: Wow and wow.  \"Wow\" because of how good it was.  And \"wow\" simply for the fact that I was wowed by a HOT DOG!  Had the beef hot dog and it was about as perfect as I can imagine such a food being. (If I recall correctly, they source their weiners from the local  Schreiner's Sausages, so certainly there's some credit due there.)  What really made this meal was that is was wrapped in a warm piece of fluffy flatbread. Best. Idea. Ever.  For toppings, I had them add pepperoncinis, bacon, and spicy mustard. Though I began to question this combo not long before sinking my teeth in, it turned out to be an excellent decision, if I do say so.  On a down note (which I didn't dock them for), the bag of chips I added to my order was stale, emanating an unpleasant dank cardboard smell. I don't know how difficult it would be, but they really should consider serving fresh chips. Even if they prepared them beforehand and kept them warm until served, it would probably put their menu over the top.  And finally, appreciated the beverages they offered, which are from smaller bottlers and provide a non-HFCS infused way to wash your food down with. I went with a GuS (Grown-up Soda) \"Extra Dry Ginger Ale\" which is not too sweet and turned out to be a good complement to my dog."}
{"text":"Ryan J brought me out here and, yes, I brought my A game--went ahead and ordered the Bear: peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, gouda and BBQ sauce. It was state-fair-what-did-I-Just-Do? awesome. So good.   The carneys selling overpriced knitting nearby were odd--but we liked the lamps the guys recreating Mad Men were pimping out there.  I don't know anything about these Short Leash Dogs people--but they clearly have something dialed in. The Bear dog was part of some contest put on by the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won, so now it's become a big deal for them.  Ryan J got a different dog. And as he reviewed nearly two years ago: you gotta \"unleash your hot dog inhibitions\" to get into this place.  Who has hot dog inhibitions? Dumb people, that's who."}
{"text":"Sorry but I cannot follow the \"crowd\" in heaping praise on the Short Leash. Totally overpriced. Slow service. The food was so sloppily prepared and presented that you wore it more than ate it. No forks or knives in sight and it could not be eaten by holding it without all the toppings falling off onto the paper plate. What a mess. there is a hot dog vendor working out of a little room at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona that puts Short Leash literally on a short leash...and to shame. Try it next time you are in Sedona. Sorry Short Leash lovers but you are busted as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"At first I thought the pepper  was in the bacon,  but my daughter's corn dog tasted super peppery too, so I think it's the beef we had.  We just couldn't  eat it, love the concept though,  and the friendly  staff."}
{"text":"I came over because I needed some caffeine. I decided on the 16oz iced vanilla latte with almond milk and I added honey in it.  It was good, but it was really strong that I couldn't drink the whole thing and ended up tossing half of my cup away.   Since it is so close to me, I will probably be back. I never went inside of their facilities or ate their donuts so I can't give you my perspective on that."}
{"text":"The amazing staff opened early to hook up me and my friends with 2 dozen fresh doughnuts! I took the recommendation of a staff member and tried the award winning Thai Coconut doughnut and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for unique flavors and something local."}
{"text":"Passing through town with my 14 yr son and I had to bring him here. We weren't brave enough to try the bear. But he loved his poutine dog and while delicious, I couldn't even finish my brat stuffed pretzel. There's a reason they serve it with a steak knife! The beer selection was aces and so was the service. Coming back to try more of the menu is the only reason my boy and I could think of to return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! Love this place!! Great place to hang out and have a coffee and a doughnut!"}
{"text":"So good! Love the veggie options. Great food truck!"}
{"text":"These hot dogs were amazing. They are not your run of the mill hot dog stand though.  The toppings are not the norm, and there is no normal bread bun. However, you must give this place a shot. The food is delicious, and makes you want to go back for seconds."}
{"text":"I am not really a huge fan of hot dogs. Yes, I know it is the trendy new thing, but I am always behind the trend. Until now---I finally tried the Short Leash Dog, and there is no going back! I tried the Oliver Dog, which is your choice of dog, I chose the chicken dog, covered with 1000 Island, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese. The best part of the dog is the pita like bread the dog comes in. It is fresh and moist. I could eat the bread alone, but topped with a juicy chicken dog, and all the toppins', I could not ask for a better lunch on a beautiful, sunny, Phoenix, Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday.  Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs.   I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day.   I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway.   WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG!   This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric.   Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too!   P.S.  For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you."}
{"text":"I love me some Short Leash!  On Tuesdays I often grab my lunch from here when they're parked in front of Urban Cookies, and today I was able to snag lunch from Short Leash at the Phx Public Market. It was no surprise that out of the 3 or 4 other food trucks parked in the lot, theirs was the only one with a steady line. I love that their ingredients are locally sourced, which means that when I support this local business, I'm essentially supporting all the other local purveyors of tasty foods as well! My favorite menu item is the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, fried pickles and sauteed onions), with a chicken dog and easy on the cream cheese. Another delicious option is the Igby (cole slaw, bbq sauce and blue cheese) with swiss. instead of blue cheese. Since their dogs are served on naan-type flatbread, you're saved from the awful and inevitable split along the bottom that traditional hot dog buns so tragically suffer from. Pure genius! I have yet to branch out from the chicken dog as I'm not a big consumer of pork and beef products, so I can't vouch for any of the other dog options. I did, however, try a bite of a jalapeno-cheese Corn Pup and it sure was awesome! The owners couldn't be nicer, also! Just an all-around lovely food truck that Phoenix is lucky to have."}
{"text":"Yes, I get the hype, Short Leash is a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene, but I don't think this is the perfect food cart by any means.  The dogs are delicious, I love the local-organic focus, and the cart itself is very attractive.  I just can't seem to justify 5 stars, here's why:  The dogs are much smaller than the naan, leaving lots of bread and toppings left over.  The naan could be adjusted for the dogs a bit, I mean, if you're going to go to the trouble...  The naan is good but mine was kind of undercooked, leaving some bites overly chewy.  The toppings don't all fuse together that well, leaving much of them to drop out of the bread.  I wasn't given a fork and was left scrambling for beans.  I welcome Short Leash and wish them well, but don't go thinking it's going to revolutionize hot dogs, it's just a good dog.  Worth $5?  Maybe if the dogs were a bit bigger."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan.  Partially because this was the most filling hotdog I have ever had.    I 100percent put my taste buds in the hands of the owners and just said give me whatever I should have.  They brought me out two halves prepared in two different styles,  One had beans and was delicious (the Miko I think)  and the other was spicy (the Aiko I think).  I was absolutely in love with both.  They apparently will be at Shady's every Thursday night and Public Market more often.  From now on every time I see them I'm stopping.    YUM!"}
{"text":"I always love making myself gourmet hotdogs and brats at home, so this place is like a dream come true.You simply pick your dog and then choose from a massive list of toppings. The Best part is, it is not on a normal bun but a flat bread so all the toppings fit in and roll up nicely. I've had two different ones and they were both great. I want more and would recommend it.to anyone. Great food, very nice service, love this place."}
{"text":"Love short leash. The best part is they have vegan options with great toppings to choose from. I've been to short leash many times in a variety of places and every time they are extremely nice and consistent with their food. Definitely the best food truck I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and am so happy I finally did!! The BEST hotdogs downtown and I love the idea of using pita instead of a bun.  Really cute ambiance with a vintage feel and they even sell Mexican Coke and Big Red out of the bottles.  My friend had the Bloody Mary and said it was the BEST he's had in a long time."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  They have great tasting hot dogs and brats with a wide variety of toppings all for about $6 to $7 per dog.  I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ive been hearing from numerous friends that Short Leash Dogs serve amazing food, but Ive always missed them....until last Wed.  They were the only reason I went to the ASU food truck block party and I was not disappointed. Being a pretty adventurous foodie (and coming from a region where we eat peanut butter on hamburgers) I decided to dive right in and order a Bear: Peanut butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked gouda, bacon, and BBQ sauce on the dog of my choice (all beef) wrapped in a flatbread. Um, delicious. Tangy, and sweet and just throughly enjoyable. I never ever wouldve thought that that combination of ingredients would be as good as it was. Ill definitely be making more trips to SLD."}
{"text":"TASTY DOGS!!!!!! One of the best hot dogs I have ever had!! It's a mom and pop own food stand. But well designed and friendly service. The price isn't to bad just make sure to bring cash though. But the way Brad and Kat make their gourmet hot dogs makes them stand out from the rest of those hot dog restaurants. Now if everyone can just convince them to open a store up and have more hours that would be AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"They are also at Shady's (Indian School and 27th) on Thursday nights!"}
{"text":"Love. 5 bucks for a super tasty dog with ample fixins served in naan? Yes. And they have chicken dogs! And veggie dogs too. Great for those of us who are not into beef or pork. The chicken dog is super flavorful. I love it \"Lady\" style (fried pickles, onions, chipotle cream cheese)  or \"Igby\" style (bbq sauce, cole slaw, blue cheese). Service is fast and friendly and I love that they include a lollipop with each order, very cute. Find them, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mmmm...the Aiko with a beer hot! Mango chutney, fresh red onion, tucked into a warm soft flatbread. Best lunch ever at Phoenix Saturday Public Market."}
{"text":"Sean S's review pretty much covered it all, but I had to reaffirm the goodness of this food truck.  I had the spicy one with the green chile, and it was very tasty.  Though I'd only give my dog about a 4 out of 5, there were so many different permutations that I could have chosen; there are potentially limitless 5-star combinations possible.    Oh, did I mention that the service was great?  Really nice people and they really aimed to please.  Just ask and they'll walk you through all the dogs and help come up something extra special just for you.    All in all, I really liked eating here."}
{"text":"Hello. I think I love you!   I FINALLY got to try out short leash dogs at the Yelp pleY event!  The corn dogs were probably my favorite! Though the other little bites were just as fantastic! I cant wait to actually eat a meal from this place!   Keep it up! You guys rule!"}
{"text":"YUM! If you haven't tracked this Food Truck down, you haven't lived in Phoenix. These guys serve Hot Dogs Right!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most interesting hot dog I have ever eaten. Vegetarian dog with some kind of mango? SO GOOD! I wish I could follow them around and always have that kind of tasty option. Little pricey at $7 but not bad. Worth it, for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Food Truck Friday and my lunch companion had her heart set on The Bear. I took a quick look around and knew I wanted to follow her. I ordered the same on a veggie dog and got jalapeños instead of bacon. Eero (cool name, cute kid) took my order, complimented me on my name, and was a nice guy, kudos to him. They put a lot of jalapeños on my order but boy was it delicious! Sweet, savory and spicy: killer combination. When else does peanut butter, BBQ sauce, cracker jacks, Gouda cheese, and jalapeños mesh well together? Nowhere except at Short Leash. Keep doing your thing, y'all.   I also noticed their donut truck but they seemed to have run out, alas, til next time."}
{"text":"I can walk there to get doughnuts every weekend. I can stop by in the middle of my shopping trip in Biltmore to get doughnuts.   Creative with ingredients and also tasty, not too sweet not too oily."}
{"text":"YES!!! this was soo good, a little messy but good. It is at a farmers market on Wed and Saturdays from 8am-1pm ish. I went around 12 and the wasn't a big line.  I got my dog pretty fast and wow was it amazing. I got the Aiko with a Hot Beer Dog. The spices were perfect and soo tasty. The Aiko had Mango Chutney, Jalapenos, Mayo, (something else but i can't remember). This was served on flatbread/pita or whatever you want to call it. It was quite different way to eat your dog, but wow I love the idea and it was super good.   Got my food in about 3 minute wait, there isn't really too many tables to sit at so prepare to be friendly with some strangers or learn how to stand and eat. I am not afraid of strangers yet soo i sat with one and ate.   Be aware if you have big sleeves food will fall in it ... mango chutney was in my jacket sleeve...soo my arm smelled REAL good after. I did get a \"complain\" that my breath smelled like mango chutney...but whatever i think they were just jealous of me getting some good food :)  oh yeah 5 dollar a specialty dog...heck yes good deal, it filled me up!"}
{"text":"A while ago the words \"hot dog\" and \"food truck\" would have made me cringe. Combine those words and I'd turn green. Short Leash Dogs has changed my mind and has me wagging my tail.  Short Leash is a food truck that offers gourmet hot dogs, sausages, and brats all from a local vendor - Schreiner's Sausages. They can be found where most food trucks convene around town, but I enjoy them every third Thursday of every month at Whole Foods Raintree. They have 5 regular \"combos\", a weekly special, and build your own. The build your own is rather daunting, as there are so many toppings. I love that they come on Naan bread instead of hot dog buns. (The Naan bread is super soft, so you know it's fresh.) They also have corn dogs for the kids or young at heart. (They are delish.)   The line can be long, but the actual service is quick and friendly. Also, a long line indicates how good the food is! And let me tell you, it's good! I've had a brat, an Italian sausage, and the \"adult\" corn dog (jalapenos and cheddar). My friend had the veggie dog and said it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to trying everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good.  And how the heck does the owner Brad remember all of our names!?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix.  The menu is creative and really tasty.  The beer list is long and affordable.  And the service is really great.  This is a great lunch spot in downtown Phoenix.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Called in a Togo but ended up inhaling it there. The guy that was working(believe he had glasses on) was incredibly sweet and not judgmental that I decided to eat there after packing up the dog. Good thing I keep my back to him because I seriously ate that vegan dog so damn fast he would've thought he was dreaming. Without asking, he set a cup of water next to me. It made my day as I was about to be late for a meeting and didn't want to go in starving.   A cup of water...that's all it took for me to know that he's the type of server/bartender to put himself in the guests position and go the extra mile. Meant more than ya know dude!"}
{"text":"I had the beer hot dog with their signature askio (or something like that) addons. It was quite good. I then got a beer hot dog with more normal fixings and it was good as well. They have some unique signature hot dogs that I wasn't brave enough to get. The bear has peanut butter and cracker jacks. One of my friends got it and they said that it was good, minus the cracker jacks. I personally really liked the two dogs I got, but I wouldn't say that they were the best hot dogs that I have ever had. I like hot dogs in a bun, not a pita.  All that being said, I still am a fan, and I would recommend them!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the doughnuts here. I got the coffee cake donut and bought the maple bacon for a friend. They were INTENSE! A little too much for me, but that doesn't mean I would not, say, try another donut to see if it suits me better. I mean, you have to find the right one! The coffee was also good. Not bitter like some other establishments."}
{"text":"I'm loving Short Leash Dogs!! Walking into Old Town Tavern for drinks, we noticed their food truck right next to the bar and decided to check it out. What a good call! All the other Yelper reviews have summed it up pretty well, so I won't be repetitive! Definitely get your hot dog on the naan fry bread - you'll never want a regular hot dog bun again! Great service and one of the best hot dogs I've had in a while!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a charming historic turned hipsterish part of town. We stopped in on the drive back to California. We arrived 11ish a.m. to a sparse donut selection. High demand is always a good sign. The Thai coconut custard donut looked intriguing. We quickly inhaled the sweet, yeasty bit of gluttony and thoroughly enjoyed it.   We were tempted to patronize the establishment because of the unique rose cognac latte we perused on yelp.  Unfortunately, to our immense disappointment we were told that they were out of the sugar to make the drink. We were cheerfully offered a not so exciting vanilla latte as an alternative but opted for the cold  brew instead."}
{"text":"Crazy. Awesome. Good. I cannot believe it took me this long to try some Short Leash Dogs!!  The truck is adorable and the service is top notch. I don't have to repeat things 50 times and the service is much quicker than I expected.  I ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.  It was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. I'm not complaining though. Next time I'll just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me.   Additionally they have pepsi in a bottle, which is hard core. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"After much anticipated waiting, my friend and I got to finally try this place. Unfortunately after all the hype my expectations were high but overall I still think it was pretty good. Interesting flavor combos. Got the Lady with the brat- chipotle cream cheese, fried pickles, and onions on flatbread. Liked that they used the flatbread better than regular buns. Would be back to try other combo flavors."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Brings a whole new dimension to hot dogs. Only the best ingredients and cooked to perfection. I had no idea that a dog this different could be so wonderful - Simply Outstanding"}
{"text":"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.  I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.   I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!"}
{"text":"Short leash has been on my list of favourite eateries for quite some time now. I love that they're all over the valley and that I don't have to deal with the food truck Fridays crowd just to get some good wiener.  There isn't much to be said about Short Leash that hasn't been said countless times already. I love me some Short Leash. The team is amazing. The product is high quality. Everything is put together with seemingly effortless flair. Brad and Kat always make it a point to say hello when they recognize you. They are always bringing new stuff out for patrons to try. And the usual (whichever yours may be) is always, always, always consistent.   My go to is the naked Aiko with fried pickles on top. The boy likes the Bear or occasionally a corn dog. I have yet to find a reason to complain. Not that I'm looking. Just, one has never arisen!   You can find me every few Wednesdays ordering my usual for lunch at the Shine and Dine. I love it. Its never very crowded, so I don't have to wait the treacherous Food Truck Friday lines, and I can order my coffee while I wait for my dog!   Hooray for Short Leash! Making the world a better place one wiener at a time!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to give this place a try.  I hate to be a bit negative but I will be honest.  Rollover does have quite a few different doughnuts to choose from and the names and descriptions seemed very tempting to me.  I decided to buy a few so I can share the goodness with my family.  Bought 6 (pricey) but thought it would be worth it. They looked so good to me. The description of each doughnut was sounding good. Took them home and everyone had a taste of each doughnut.  There was no mmmm, there was no OMG. Just ehh ok.  So I believe it is the dough itself that just killed it.  The variety that I picked were the maple doughnut , pistachio,coffee cake doughnut, chocolate, and vanilla. To me the dough was very heavy. These doughnuts tasted like they were literally a week old. Everyone at home said that.  Maybe we did get old doughnuts.  I don't know. So a lot of people asked me at the office what I thought I said I didn't like them.  I didn't tell anyone not to try them. But no one wants to pay for a pricey doughnut and be disappointed.  Especially if you have that craving for just a doughnut. Just with that being said when we went to Food Truck Friday everyone went for the pies."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I travel a fair amount and am an avid donut aficionado and the Black and Blue (brioche doughnut filled with blackberry and blueberry jams and dusted with lavender sugar) may be the best donut I have ever had. Period. Also tried the Maple Bacon which was excellent. Can't wait to go back soon. They aren't the cheapest ($2-3 per donut) but worth every penny. Also had a caramel macchiato which was perfect. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Keep in mind, brioche donuts will be a bit denser and sweeter but give em a try, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything in this truck is amazing, but I tip my hat to the Bear Dog. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, cheese, and bbq sauce on a hot dog somehow works fabulously.   Each hotdog is named after a customer's dog and every week they feature a new dog of the week. Someday I'll submit one named for my dog too.    Side note, the fried pickles are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed food trucks when I'm in New York because they are cheap, fast and convenient, so I had to try this place. I live within walking distance from here, so I have no excuse for not going sooner.  Well I finally checked it out this morning  and ordered a vegetarian hotdog with all the spices and relish on a pita bread.  I have to say that I concur with the other yelper's commentary. Yum! :)"}
{"text":"A little expensive for a hot dog, it's still a hot dog. Fried pickles are amazing. Mac and cheese is a bit bland but good. Pretzels are really good. Good place to eat over all. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously good dogs. Get em how you want or order one of their specialties. All of them come on flat bread. I like the igby which has bbq sauce, Cole slaw and blue cheese...3 of my fav ingredients! They're at the food truck Fridays downtown every week.   You can either select one of the created menu items, or build your own dog. I have also had the Aiko dog, which comes with mango chutney, jalapeno, cilantro, red onion and mayo. I chose a hot beef dog as my \"dog selection\" here. Overall very good, but I could have done without the mango. Not that the mango was bad just that it seemed a bit too much as it kept falling out of my flat bread!   Always excited for whatever creation I can have next time I go."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. Lots of interesting choices. I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"For a hot minute there I was actually the duchess of this food truck so I guess it is about time I updated my original review. Every time I have the opportunity to eat a dog from Short Leash I will. They are just so tasty. No matter what kind of sausage link you get, it tastes delicious! And even throughout my low-carb phase I still have to get the bun because I absolutely love them with the naan bread. My favorite is still the Bear with a spicy brat. That is just heaven!"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs but rarely have them with anything but a squirt of mustard. That was until I tried the Igby; Coleslaw and crumbled Bleu Cheese drizzled with tangy BBQ sauce. Just so incredibly tasty, words do not do it justice, just go out and try it, fall in love and dream about it!"}
{"text":"Had my first Short Leash Dog at the food Truck Friday a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)"}
{"text":"I finally got to try the fabled Short Leash hot dog last week when they were parked outside the Convention Center during Comicon. For those that are hot dog traditionalists, this might not be a good hot dog for you, since they wrap the hot dog in a naan-like flatbread, and the selection of condiments for your hot dogs is more unique.   I tried the Aiko, a hot dog with some sweet and spicy flavors. You have your choice of different meats for your hot dog, and I chose the spicy hot. Overall, each component in the meal was good, but it was generally just a little too sweet for my tastes.   Service was fast and friendly.  Oh and they offer veggie dogs too for those that are vegetarians. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a good donut in awhile. Stumbled on this spot when I was craving for chai tea. I was greeted by  nice lady who was happy to describe the different donuts. I chose the pistachio. Good choice. The end. Five star."}
{"text":"Back again we go (okay, so this wasn't the C-Clan's first time back...Ive stopped counting how many times we've had SLD..lol) for some tasty dogs on Wednesday night at the PPM! I mention that I wanted to try something different than my jalapeno corn dog.  J about fell on the floor when I mentioned trying something new and building it from the toppings on the menu.   I shall name my dog creation - Tatonka aka Buffalo Dog.   Or maybe \"The Leroy\" after my mom's dachshund.  :)  Chicken dog, blue cheese, tomato, and the faux buffalo sauce concoction that Kat, Brad, and I conjured up!  AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!  I think next time I shall try adding cole slaw at Kat's suggestion.  And maybe some onion.     And congrats to the Short Leash Family on the brick and mortar venture!!   The C-Clan is looking forward to the grand opening!"}
{"text":"WOWzer!  Hot Diggity Dog!  Best hot dog hands down!!   I was introduced to Short Leash's corn doggies at the Ultimate Pleydate Yelp Party.  And I finally made it out of work to go check them out.  They are located certain times during the week downtown Phoenix where they hold the city market.  There were many food trucks lined up, but I was headed straight for Short Leash.  My eye was on the prize.    I ordered the Igby all beef hot dog and a corn doggy.  It was delish!  They even have sodas in a glass bottle for sale, and they do take credit cards.  I noticed that there were more people in line for Short Leash.  Once you go, you will understand why.  The owner was there taking orders.  I had my name badge on, and I liked how he called me by name the whole time I was ordering.  Very cool!  I agree with Lindsey F., \"Imagine every hot dog you've ever had. Ok, now throw every image out the window because you haven't tasted anything until you've had a hot dog from Short Leash Dogs. \"  That says it all!"}
{"text":"Great dogs! Was very pleased to find they had a veggie dog option- and it was tasty as well! I had my veggie dog Lady style (chipotle cream cheese and sauteed onions) and it was delicious. Only downside was they had run out of some ingredients by the time I visited but it was a delicious dog regardless."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing a recommendation from a Facebook friend, and boy, am I glad I did. Hot dogs and donuts - why hasn't anyone thought of this idea sooner? They even have hotdogs on naan, which is such a healthier alternative. I like to get mine with goat cheese and arugula as well. Don't get it twisted, I also got a donut with cookie dough frosting, and I think that was the best part. I will be back on my lunch break!"}
{"text":"Please go out of your way to find out where they are located!  You won't regret it.  I have eaten here many times (20+) at Food Truck Friday.  They were part of the food service at World of Beer in Tempe last Saturday.  They had many regulars follow them to WOB and we chatted with many people in the bar who also keep Short Leash on a Short Leash and follow them around town."}
{"text":"I have heard more about this from Jon H. than I can tell you. He did not understate how great these hot dogs are. I almost wouldn't categorize them as hot dogs because they are better than any others I have ever had. Short Leash Dogs is not to be missed."}
{"text":"The spicy dog was to die for! REALLY yummy and hot without overwhelming the other flavors on my doggy (^_^)"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and WONDERFUL service. Literally have loved everything I've ordered (which is a lot). So many options and combos with a \"featured\" dog every week, which really keeps me coming back. I love supporting local, and I REALLY love supporting local when the food is great and owners actually care about your experience. Can't rave enough about Short Leash. A true gem of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had some budget to spend for my office so I arranged to have Short Leash come out to cater lunch today. I contacted Kat and Brad about three weeks ago and they were super nice, very easy to work with. They gave me a date that worked so we booked it. They came by today about half an hour before the scheduled event, got situated, and were on their way. Everyone in the office was raving about the food. I took a culinary risk and had the Bear. Don't be fooled by what you may read, it's a wonderful combination of flavors that went really well with the spicy dog. They were a pleasure to work with and I hope to do something again with them in the future!"}
{"text":"The bear with a bratwurst, Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce is AMAZING."}
{"text":"I swear I already wrote a review for Short Leash but I guess not. Everywhere I go where food trucks are present, Short Leash always seems to be there. They always have the longest line too. My coworkers and I try to make it out to the food trucks every 3rd Thursday in front of the Whole Foods off of Raintree Dr. They always get Short Leash and after seeing them order the corn dogs every time, I caved and had to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, their jalapeno and cheese corn dog is the best I've ever had. I was a little skeptical because I'm not a huge spicy food person but I was told that it was pretty mild (which it is). The batter definitely made it, it was nice and crunchy (not soggy like your usual corn dog). I may have to try one of their dogs next time but the corn dog was so good I don't know if I can stray away. If you do decide to make a custom dog, you can put on as many toppings as you want without an extra charge. I think that's pretty neat since places usually charge you for every little extra thing."}
{"text":"Manna donuts of heaven! Not just amazing flavor combos (orange glaze with pistachio FTW) but really well-made donuts served by charming and delightful people in the geographic center of cuteness.  It is impossible to get enough of these donuts."}
{"text":"I love this place --- right near the Art Museum and the Heard Museum --- makes for a great day out.  The location is hard to find if you are travelling North on Central (Phoenix does some odd things in this neck of the woods) --- need to do a U turn at Virginia or Thomas  Fave = spicy Thai coconut donuts  (amaaazing!) Weekly specials are fun ----  Really --- you can't miss with these  and ... When these donuts are fresh they are unbelievable ---"}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs! Prepared with attention to detail."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of cart food, but these folks are great. Clean inside and out, they offer a consistently great meal with weekly specials and regulars. The staff is super friendly, knew me by name on my second visit, and even after I had been away for a few weeks."}
{"text":"This food truck is amazing! The food keeps you going back for more. Who knew a hot dog can be so good. I been ordering the Lady and just can not get enough. It has fried pickles on it and a spicy sauce. All these flavors really mesh well together. Cant wait for my next visit! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts, got the adult donut (sweet burbon cream), chocolate cookie dough, and orange pistachio. Great texture and flavor. To me they are just the right consistency  not too dry or too greasy. Recommended if near downtown Phoenix. A lot of seating areas outside to lounge and fill your tummy"}
{"text":"Beautiful day at the market. There's a little line at Short Leash but worth the wait. Ordered the Lady and my sister had the Aiko dog. Both were delicious. Please support our locals and check 'em out."}
{"text":"Hotdogs and donuts .. Umm yes please.. you can't go wrong with this combo.   On today's visit I had the Sunny.. a chicken hotdog with peaches, goat cheese and arugula on naan .. great flavor combination.. with a side of fried pickles... crunchy and fried just right. My daughter had the Monika .. two cheese stuffed hotdogs wrapped in corn tortillas and bacon with a side of dragon sauce and French fries.. the sauce was really good with the hotdog and fries.  For dessert we shared the bourbon donut.. a brioche donut with chocolate custard and bourbon cream .. covered in powdered sugar.. it's a smaller donut, light texture and the perfect level of sweetness.. this is for the 21 and over crowd..   The donut display case looked amazing! You should leave room for one or two of these yummy treats  I definitely recommend this place next time you're in downtown.. they have gluten free and vegetarian options also."}
{"text":"Loved it!  We each had one of their breakfast specials and they were delicious!  Hubby even called it the best thing he has had from a food truck in Phoenix!  Great quality, tasty flavors, good portions."}
{"text":"My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?  Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart?   Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!  The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!  I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.  Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!  Wiener wiener wiener!"}
{"text":"I finally caught up with these guys at the phoenix market. I really love the soft flat bread they use as buns, its wonderful. And the owner, couldn't be nicer. My experience was really a positive one. The dog I had with the mango chutney on it was great, the one with blue cheese, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce was surprisingly good as well. I hope to catch them at shadys in the future!"}
{"text":"YASSSS. These doughnuts are exactly what your Monday morning needs... or really any morning to be honest! My husband and I tried three different doughnuts- coffee cake with coffee cream filling, maple bacon, and plain vanilla with sprinkles. All of the doughnuts were very soft, but retained their full and thick shape while eating. The coffee cake one was topped with coffee cake crumbles and icing. The toppings gave it the coffee cake crunch feeling, but with a soft and doughy touch. The filling was just perfect. It tasted like a coffee with a little cream in it, so it was just what I expected! The maple bacon one was so flavorful! I loved the flavor mix of sweet and salty. It also has the texture mix of fluffy and crispy, so all of your senses are intrigued. Finally, the plain vanilla with sprinkles was far from plain! The icing was just dripping off the doughnut and would melt in your mouth to give you that *drooling while smiling* sensation.  Atmosphere is similar to any diner- metal and wood chairs with metal tables. The outside seating area is a great spot for your morning coffee and to just relax before starting your day. The staff is friendly and welcoming too! I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Nashville has no good donut shoppes so when I travel I always seek out local places to get my fix. After much research, we decided on Rollover and we're not disappointed.   The donuts are large, fresh, beautiful and full of flavor. I had the Thai Spicy donut and cognac rose latte. Amazing flavors. Others got the strawberry donut and the caramel bacon donut, both were amazing as well!  Go there and get your fill on creative donuts and coffee!"}
{"text":"Another amazing creation from Brad and Kat! We have had a couple of different types at shortleash but we went to the grand opening today and it was awesome. We came a little late and they were almost out of everything (yay for them!).  They are really unique. I was not in a donut mood today so I just got tea but because they were out of what I wanted the girl at the register gave me a thai coconut donut to go (so nice!). It was really unique. It was full of sweet and spicy. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I loved it when it was Shine and was excited to try scratch made doughnuts today but sadly I was left underwhelmed. We came at 9 AM today and there were 4 donuts left that looks like it's been sitting there since they opened. From what I see in from the writing in the window, there should have been a dozen different variety but unfortunately, we only got to pick from the 4 old donuts. The donuts were stale and heavy tasting, nothing to write home about. I really was looking forward to biting into a soft fluffy and melt in your mouth donut but these were very heavy and doughy.  Luckily, the coffee is still decent thus the extra star."}
{"text":"Great little donut shop. Stopped in with my fiancé to get a few donuts and they were excellent. Can't wait to go back and stuff my face."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I decided to hunt this food truck down and check it out for myself and I am so happy that I did. Not only is the food wonderful the service is great! The owners treat you like family. Definitely a must try if you haven't gone and if you have you already know its a must go to place when you want some yummy food!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly...to people, to dogs, to doughnut lovers. On this Ohioans first trip to Phoenix, the employee ran me through all the flavors and was incredibly kind. Settled on the Thai coconut and pistachio donuts. Delicious. Please go. And Rollover, please have a mandatory fun trip to the Grand Canyon for all your employees. :)"}
{"text":"Diggity dank dawgz!  I've been frequenting the Food Truck Fridays for lunch at Phoenix Public Market recently and finally made it back around to sample another Short Leash Dog. Originally, I tried the Beer Hot sausage, Aiko style (mango chutney and other goodies) and was blown away. I now know this is the real deal since I tried the Bratwurst Sausage with swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island Dressing... also crazy delicious! While not a traditional German emulsified weisswurst, these brats from Schreiner's deliver on taste.  Can't say I'm too crazy about the Corn Pups. Couldn't really detect the jalapeño and cheese too much and I prefer a sweeter corn meal batter to counteract the tartness of yellow mustard. But do try the deep fried pickles if you get a chance. They have a great crunch... and (surprise!) they're sweet pickles, not dill!  This food truck is a great addition to the Phoenix food landscape. I hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"Legitly, one of my favorite places for coffee!  Though the donuts are denser as a raised donut, the flavor combinations are wild. I'm obsessed with their Iced Rose Cognac Latte and come back almost every week and the great service from the gals working the registers is too inviting not to come back.  I love the living room space and work in there for hours, it's perfectly air conditioned and quiet. Definitely an under appreciated space, but I'm okay with that if it means I get it all to myself! /evillaughhere"}
{"text":"\"But I don't even LIKE hotdogs!\" I proclaimed as I devoured half of my BFs beer hot Oliver style.  That is what I thought until I had my first taste of Short Leash Dogs at the Downtown Phx market a few Sundays ago.  I was shocked at how much I loved it!  The bread!  It's so soft and compliments the dog and toppings perfectly.  The dog, the endless variety of toppings!  So awesome, I can't imagine better street food, and I can't wait to try the one with cream cheese and fried pickles.  In fact, I am planing my next visit as I type this, reminded of how instead of stealing my bfs - I have to have one of my very own ASAP."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. I don't think there is anything from Short Leash that isn't amazing. Even my vegetarian friends can walk away happy. My favorite is the Aiko with sriracha. Even if you don't want a specialty dog, there are so many FREE toppings to choose from, you can make your own concoction. Definitely visit their Sit-N-Stay location Friday nights at Central & Camelback. The menu is different, but still delicious!  Bottom line... if you don't like Short Leash you are probably the kind of person who hates puppies and love."}
{"text":"After a trip to the Market, I was roped into trying a short leash dog. I generally as a rule of thumb, refuse to eat hot dogs, but I decided to make an exception, because Sean S. said they were sooooo good. I decided to have a vegetarian dog with mango chutney, jalapeño, and mayo. It was pure heaven and served on a delicious piece of naan. Kudos to the creativity of the dog topping combinations. The combinations are named after the owners pets, dogs none the less - how cute is that? Delicious, filling, and unique. What more can I say? Stop by the Market on Wednesday night or Saturday morning and try one for yourself!"}
{"text":"tried the aiko...with a chicken dog. it was delish! great dog...great toppings...perfect combo (i was skeptical!). friendly service and hot food! i'll try again...and will try another type...another time!"}
{"text":"Great little boutique  Service was perfect, food and coffee were on point! Definitely a come back too when in town. Worth the visit especially if you have a pet :)"}
{"text":"I pretty much love this place. The hot dogs are great and the options for toppings are unending. It is a little pricey for a hot dog but still worth a stop in. FYI The location at the Biltmore does not have fried pickles (which are amazing) so go to the original location for full options."}
{"text":"O my goodness!! I just tried The Bear today (a.k.a. the 7th Inning Stretch) and it was crazy delicious! Where else in the Valley can you get a spicy naan wrap dog smothered with Cracker Jacks, peanut butter, crumbled bacon, smoked gouda cheese and BBQ sauce? I admit that it sounds like a wreck, but I have never had such a tasty dog in my life. Live on the wild side and give it a try, you may never think of hot dog toppings the same way again!"}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Thai Coconut and Orange Glaze and Chopped Pistachio donuts and they were delicious! I love donuts and they were some of the best that I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Honestly?  Kind of disappointing.  My family got a half dozen donuts on a Sunday morning when my parents came to town for a visit and nobody was especially impressed.  The donuts all tasted too greasy and worse, it had that 'day-old oil' taste going.  I love fun donut shops and don't mind paying two or three bucks a donut--when it's worth it.  Since moving to Arizona, we've been looking for something to satisfy our (San Diego's) Donut Bar craving but have still yet to find it.  Rollover could have been having a bad day but I don't think I'll be back to find out."}
{"text":"Their sausages are made by a place called Schreiners Fine Sausages.  If you don't like the casing on your dog to snap when you bite into it, this is not the place for you.  The food is good, and they have interesting menu options.  Everything from saurkraut and swiss to peanut butter and bacon.  They also sell a hand battered corn dog, coleslaw, fried pickles, and kettle chips.  A highlight are the fried pickles.  They are great by themselves or as a topping on your dog.  I was underwhelmed by the coleslaw--It was good, but not great.  If the coleslaw had more flavor, and the batter on the corn dog was a little sweeter, I would give this place a solid 5.  4 stars ain't bad though.  I will definately be back to try the \"Bear.\"  Bear (7th inning stretch) Peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon and BBQ sauce.  It takes stones to have something like this on your menu, and perhaps equal stones to order it.  I love it when a solid business has a challenging menu item for the public to wax and wane over trying."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in all of Phoenix, hands down. Over the years I've been vegetarian, gluten free, no pork/beef. No matter what my tastes I know I can always find something at Short Leash. Love the names of each of the hot dogs, I have my favorite - let's just say, I love me some sauerkraut! Check out the location downtown or in Biltmore, for lunch or dinner or a snack late night - they offer food at Valley Bar!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great outdoor seating, doughnuts, coffee, right off the light rail. So glad they transformed this space into a cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"This is the first review I've written where I wish I could give more than five stars.  I was so hesitant to try this place based on all the hipster reviews and and the preconcieved notion that is overpriced stuff that appeals to granolas and hipsters. Well, that may be true, but I think it appleals to everyone as well. I ordered the Noki, a dog with green chiles, pintos, cheese, and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog. They serve the dogs on flatbread which is awesome beyond belief! The taste and quality was definitely there and the portion is enormous.   Where I really want to give this place more stars is the service. I want to say they have worked in high levels of service industry before because name usage was constant. They took my name for the order and used it at least three times in conversation with me. I noticed they had a catch for bottle caps from the sodas they sell, so I asked if my girlfriend could have them for an art project she is doing. Not only did he say she could take them, but gave her a ziplock bag for them, offered to save them from future days, and tried to refuse when I recognized the great service and gave a tip.   in short (get it?) these guys get how to run a business. They are friendly, helpful, serve high quality food, and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs. They take credit cards as well through a Droid app the guy has on his cell phone, and you sign with your finger on the phone's touch screen. I don't go to the market much, and I try not to eat hot dogs, but if I'm ever out and about when this truck is there, I'll definitely stop by again.  One hundred stars, thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"Great space, service is great, but the doughnuts were dry, frosting was over the top sugary, and there wasn't a great selection. We had chocolate glaze on raised, pistachio orange glaze on cake, and the choc chip cookie dough glaze on cake - all had the same problems.  I'm hopeful that they're just working out the kinks.  There's definitely room in Phoenix for a solid doughnut shop."}
{"text":"Finally caught up with the Short Leash Dogs Truck. Thanks to Twitter I have been able to track down this hotdog heaven on wheels. We caught up with the truck at the Phoenix Market this Wednesday. This is a usual stop for Short Leash and they are joined by other food trucks. Very cool scene for a Weds. night.  We pretty much ordered the left side of the menu. We ordered the \"Lady\" and \"Moki\" both hot dogs are nestled into pita like buns (delicious). Absolutely the best hotdog I have had west of Wrigley Field. Sorry, Chicago dog will always be my fav.   We also ordered a couple of the corndogs. Love their batter. Has kind of a cornbread consistency to it. I would recommend getting one or two of these.  We also ordered the fried pickles. I have always heard about fried pickles, but I have not found a place to try them. So glad Short Leash was my first. Would much rather have fried pickles than fries.   The meal was awesome. The price was awesome. The Owners are awesome. We will be supporting this food truck regularly and will make sure we spread the word with our friends."}
{"text":"The Phoenix food truck scene is finally taking off. We have almost every kind of gourmet food truck that other cities are proud to showcase. The first thing you will notice when approaching Short leash is their huge line, while virtually every other food truck doesn't have a line. Don't be tempted to leave. The lines are long- but completely worth it. Just a mustard dog kind of person? Don't be boring! Shortleash aren't just any hot dog...don't be afraid! My first glance at the menu, I was intrigued. Mango Chutney? Mayonnaise? hmmm...  After my first Short Leash- I was sold! I love trying their special of the day in order to try the latest and greatest concoction. I just had one that I still talk about that included a pretzal bun and apple cole slaw. Yum! Try it once, and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Orange Glaze and Chopped Pistachios Maple Glaze and Candied Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough with Salty Brown Butter Glaze Apple Fritter Coffee Cake Doughnut filled with Coffee Custard, Dipped in Vanilla Bean Icing, Cinnamon Walnut Streusel Champagne Doughnut filled with Champagne Custard, Topped with Champagne Frosting, Fresh Strawberry  Admittedly a fan of neither hot dogs nor foodtrucks it still strikes this writer as odd that Shortleash Hot Dogs was visited during a 15 month stay in Phoenix, but coming away fairly impressed at the time a return to the city shows the brand to have expanded substantially, several trucks now joined by something far more befitting my proclivities than encased meat in the form of fried dough.  Playing off the \"dog\" theme, patrons actually encouraged to send in photos of their furry friends in sponsorship of specials, it was just after 8am that I approached the small Vernon Avenue kiosk housing Rollover Doughnuts and greeted by a pair of friendly young woman I was sadly informed that the savory oft-cited \"Bear\" was no longer available due to 'lack of interest,' a half-dozen other options selected at the $11 discounted price.  Truly a \"cheaper by the dozen\" - or half dozen - space, doughnuts usually billed $2.00-$2.50 each, it was at a stone table nearby that seating was found for indulgence, items spread out and the New Year special \"Champagne\" offering glimpses of brilliance as the springy brioche pocketed rich cream custard beneath vibrant Strawberry glaze.  Attempting to taste in mild to bold fashion, a light ring of citrus topped in chopped pistachios strongly resembling a cannoli next to grace my tongue, it was unfortunate that the fritter was anything but a typical crunchy apple experience, the texture closer to a bready pull-apart without a lot of flavor beyond cinnamon to be found.  Back on track with Maple Bacon, the nearly ubiquitous modern-classic better than most as a result of natural tasting frosting and a hint of woody smoke, the best bite of the morning was next found in Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, both the base and frosting studded with dark chocolate that helped to anchor Salty Brown Butter Glaze.  Impressed to this point it was with \"Coffee Cake\" that the Rollover Doughnut tasting did end and although rarely a 'fan' of filled options the execution was every bit on-point with the fruity version prior, custard the flavor of lightly sweetened espresso quickly flooding the palate and dissipating slowly to nutty notes amidst subtle vanilla bean."}
{"text":"I finally tried and am so glad I did! Definitely not your typical dog. Warm and easy to bite into, and wrapped in delicious bread... what was that, pita?   Definitely try... you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I had previously heard many good things about Short Leash Dogs from friends. My first time at Short Leash Dogs was at their recent sit and stay for a UYE. The food truck was nestled in a alley off Central and Camelback. Seating was outdoors with some wooden tables and a fire pit in the center, great for the s'more packs and the kids really love melting the marshmallows.  Short Leash Dogs offer a new twist on the everyday hotdog. For the sit and stay they have a different menu.  I was there with a group of friends and although I really wanted to try the Bear I decided to try the bacon wrapped bockwurst. Lucky for me my friends tried both the bear and the pippin style dog.  We all shared so I got to try half the menu.  The bockwurst was a very typical German style brat with German potato salad and gravy.  It wasn't very flavorful but it was delicious.  The pippin style dog was great and flavorful even without the naan. Adding some seratcho gave it a great kick that totally brought all the flavors together. The bear ended up being my favorite. It's unique blend of peanut butter, bacon, BBQ, cracker jacks and Gouda. This odd sounding combination when at first glance sound like it wouldn't work but the BBQ and peanut butter mesh together with a flavor explosion.  Most of the dogs can be made with a variety of hot dog choices like regular dog, beer dog, and more.  My first experience was awesome and I recommend trying one of the crazy sounding concoctions made at Short Leash Dogs."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a fan of any sort of \"food truck\" food. Bad experiences with Mexican food trucks in the past have left me jaded.  That being said, upon seeing the well-taken-care-of truck & a delicious sounding menu, I decided to indulge. This was one of the best choices I've made in my entire life (I've been married, graduated college, bought a home etc) and this ranks right up there. I plan on following these fantastic people to wherever they drive their truck at least once a week."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a well-deserved review for Short Leash, and after I paid a visit to their cute little truck yesterday I think it's time.  The obvious: These dogs are delicious. Pairing creative, delicious ingredients with Schreiner's products is a no-brainer and the result is one phenomenal hot dog. I've never had a sub par meal at Short Leash, everything is tasty and perfectly cooked every time I receive my order.   What I think should really be mentioned is how good Short Leash is at bouncing back from getting swamped, or making a mistake on an order. When my partner and I placed our orders yesterday, they were knee-deep in orders with a line of 12 people behind us. While we waited, I popped into Urban Cookies for a cupcake, and when I came back out our food was already made and ready to go. Through some miscommunication we received pepper-jack corn dogs instead of the pepper-jack hush puppies we thought we had ordered. The dude handled it like a pro despite being super busy, and was really nice about the whole ordeal. What I thought was going to be at least a 10-minute wait was barely even five. Kudos to the Short Leash team for that, I'm always impressed by how friendly you are despite being stuffed into a tiny truck in 106 degree heat.    Amazing food, awesome service."}
{"text":"I am not your typical hot dog lover, but these are oh so good!  The flatbread that it comes on is full of flavor, soft, and super tasty!  I got the Aiko, and I can't wait to try more next time.  The flavor combinations that they offer are endless and could make your head spin.  $5 for a pretty large meal. It is very filling.  And Messy. Extra napkins are a must...and maybe some wet wipes lol.  The staff is beyond nice.  They seem very down to earth and genuine.  Check it out! You will not be disappointed! They are at the Phx Public Market on Wed, Fri nights, and Sat. morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"Ok... Messy, messy, messy.. But that dumb naan, or pita bread stuff was actually pretty badass.. Not too soft or brittle, held together through the whole devour'ment.. Now this was catered to us for a work party.. But I would buy again in a heartbeat....  Had the Aiko. And tho most of the variants looked weird, i was surprised how good the flavored went together.. Mango, chutney, tomato, n some sorta mayo.. Yeah.. I know, but dayum was it pretty dang good.. Cant wait to try the bear, devil dog, or get me a lady..  Good stuff"}
{"text":"Having spent the last 10 days in Portland, we came back to Phoenix lamenting about the creative food scene here - why can't Phoenix have more of 'that'! Well here you go - Short Leash Sit...Stay is what we're talking about. We had the corn dog bits appetizer with spicy mustard and a Devil Dog - with spicy beer hot dog. The food pops! Wonderful! The corn dog bits were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, and the hot dog wrapped in flat bread was an amazing mix of spicy flavors. All the hot dogs on the menu sounded delicious. We will be back. Love the owners mission: \"eating well and surrounding yourself with people who make you happy\" - mission accomplished. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I liked this place. The atmosphere was cool and open-- I would even think this place would be awesome in a place like Maui! It was different to have a hot dog on a pita-- but I didn't hate it! I had the Lady dog? I can't quite remember the name. It had grilled onions, chipotle cream cheese and fried pickles. I had originally ordered the dog without the pickles-- but the chef came out and said I have to try it with the pickles since that's what makes the dog what it is! And she was totally right-- the pickles were fried perfectly. They weren't mushy or overly oily-- instead super crisp with a perfectly fried batter. Yum.  The only thing I would recommend is for the staff to be a little more aware of the customers coming in-- maybe it was just a weird day but I felt like some customers were standing around a little longer than necessary waiting for the gal at the front to help them."}
{"text":"Incredible food and amazing service is a hard to come by these days, but Short Leash delivers!"}
{"text":"After reading all the hype, I finally made it downtown to try Short Leash Dogs... and it definitely met the high expectations. I really enjoy hot dogs, but I rarely eat them because the regular store bought weiners kind of gross me out. Short Leash's franks come from Schreiner's, so you know they're quality.    They were super helpful in explaining how everything was served and I couldn't decide what to try so they offered to make me a half Aiko and half Moki. They're served in flat bread to hold all the delicious toppings. The Aiko's main ingredient is mango chutney and jalapenos (almost reminded me of a sweet salsa). The Moki had green chilis, bean, and cheese. They were both so tasty, I couldn't decide which to eat first and which to save for my last bite.   I can't wait to go back and try some other great combos  (you can create your own from a long list of inventive toppings)."}
{"text":"Bratwurst with Mango Chutney, Cilantro & Sriacha and a side a fried pickles... heaven."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Physical location + mobile food truck. Great selection of fixings and dogs. Make it just how you like it for a very reasonable price. Will be back soon and often :)  Naandogs ftw."}
{"text":"Good Lord, this place is delicious. They make their own bloody Mary mix, the cheese sauce on the fries was clearly in house and fresh, the dogs are served in a warm fluffy naan, the beer selection on point."}
{"text":"Heads up: If you're a vegetarian, don't expect some epic veggie dog. They focus more on the quality of the real meats. It's not bad, it's just kind of measly and you could probably microwave it at home from a package.  That being said, don't be discouraged, dear herbivores. There's so much delicious shiznit that goes on top, you won't even be thinking about the dog itself. From fried pickles, to sauteed onions, to mango chutney, to bleu cheese, it's basically a topping smorgasbord. How does all of that fit in a hot dog bun? It doesn't. It's wrapped in an awesome, big-ass piece of naan, and it's going to cost you a whole 5 bucks. Even if you're not a hot dog fiend, Short Leash is a good time, so go for the novelty of it (because next time I personally deep-fry pickles for a hot dog will be approximately never.)"}
{"text":"I have no doubt that Brad and Kat could put just about anything on a hotdog wrap it in the wonderful flatbread and it would be absolutely amazing!  While I usually don't stray far from the Aiko (fresh diced mango, cilantro, onions, jalapeños on a beer hot), I have become quite fond of their Corn Pups (corn dog with spicy jalapeño cheese inside).  Recently tempted to try something new here while reading their Specials board I was drawn in by a hotdog topped with blackeye peas, onions, green chile, old fashioned english cheddar and crumbled Fritos corn chips.  FRITOS...*drool*...  I couldn't decide! Seeing my dilemma, and not being too busy at the moment, they offered to do half of each the Aiko and this daily special.   Needless to say I was yet again BLOWN AWAY with Short Leash's delicious creation. Don't doubt the Masters!  Brad and Kat know their stuff!"}
{"text":"If you love the wiener then you better try Short Leash Dogs! It's worth the wait.   I had the Moki and it was delicious! What a random but tasty combination of ingredients. Sometimes you just have to trust the experts and go with hteir suggestions - and that's what I did with this one. It was a little bit spicy and a super messy but very satisfying.   If you're looking for something different - the topping possibilities are endless.  The last star for me would be a bigger selection or beverages. Maybe they were just picked over but I'd love to see some sodas and bottled water available. I appreciate the cute factor or the cream soda, etc. but really love a cold soda and a hot dog.   I love that we're seeing these types of urban concepts in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Didn't try the donuts but grabbed a very necessary vanilla latte. Being a Seattle-ite, I'm very picky about my coffee and wasn't prepared to be blown away but the latte was very good. Smooth and not too sweet, i.e. you can actually taste the coffee as opposed to just vanilla and milk. Plus they have both indoor and outdoor seating. Nice location, not a huge parking lot but there seems to be easy access to street parking. Right across from the Heard Museum and near a light rail station. I'm really impressed at how this neighborhood has grown and will definitely be back for the coffee and to try a donut (which looked amazing!)."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon The Short Leash Food Truck  while we were at Craftateria--which I would describe as a hipster swap meet--this evening.  Waited in line for around 20-30 minutes before it was our turn to order.  The prices are definitely reasonable, I ordered a Bratwurst Moki and my wife ordered a build your own veggie dog with like 10 toppings, I also wanted to sample the Jalapeño And Cheese Corn dog (at $3 I had to) and we had to get an order of fried pickles, and a bottle of Mexican Sprite. For $20 that seemed like a bargain, these food trucks are usually higher priced.  The food was all really good, I think I enjoyed the jalapeño and cheese corn dog the most, very tasty.  The fried pickles were nice and crispy!  Again I was taken back how inexpensive it was.  All in all I say it was worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. Hate that i'm giving them anything less than 5 because i want local joints to do well.   Service was awesome. Lady explained all of the donuts, her favorites and just seemed like she wanted to help us newbies make a great decision.   We werent exactly in business for a dozen donuts but what the hell...we went a little nuts.   The only reason why im giving it a 4 stars is because their chocolate seems cheap. I'm the biggest chocolate fan ever and we did the triple chocolate, cookies & cream and chocolate icing ones and we were disappointed. The original and old fashions were amazing though!   They also fill you up big time. I ate two and was ready to go into food coma"}
{"text":"We found Short Leash Dogs about.... 7? years ago? We stumbled across their food truck in Downtown Phx. What a find!!! We love their food. Its creative and delicious.   Do yourself a favor... don't make any substitutions. Order it how the chef prepares it, even if you aren't sure. You may be surprised!   They also have a location at the Biltmore, if you are in the area, be sure to stop in their for lunch!"}
{"text":"After a long awaited second try, I believe rollover donut has significantly improved.... Their maple bacon donut is super tasty and the chocolate walnut is rich and delish.... Also the owner is super nice. Come here, eat donuts, be happy!"}
{"text":"Best donut place I've tried in Phoenix. Hands down! Great customer service. I absolutely love the coconut cream donut. The coffee cake donut is ridiculous too! Their donut dough is the bomb!!!! I love you little donut gem of the desert!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't like the red-hot on Naan fry bread you're either a vegetarian or a traitor to your country, and in either case we probably don't hang out very often. The cole slaw and BBQ dog is also TDF.  Short Leash's owners put together an impressive ensemble of local food truck vendors for the Downtown Mobile Food Court, open Fridays 11am-1pm in the Phoenix Public Market parking lot. Today's debut drew massive crowds and I expect the roster of food trucks to grow in the coming weeks."}
{"text":"I visited Rollover yesterday to try the donuts and coffee I hear everyone raving about. I ordered the orange cardamom latte, an orange pistachio and a maple bacon donut. The coffee was excellent as well as the orange pistachio donut. The maple bacon donut I can't quite get behind. There was something off about their maple glaze- it was oddly spicy and didn't go well with the bacon in my opinion- sort of messed with the whole salty and sweet sensation that you would expect."}
{"text":"Second time here and miserable experiences both times. Horribly ran business. First time I was there with a large group and hey refused to serve us inside - we could only order on the patio. Problem is, the server was absent, she refused to let people pay as they go, she couldn't figure out each persons tab, and we ended up being delayed almost 30 minutes just waiting for our checks. Mind you, this was a prearranged party, so it wasn't a surprise that 50 of us showed up. Tonight they refused to serve us at all!! Issue with their card machine which is fine, but seriously we waited 15 minutes for it to get figured out and absolutely no accommodations. We had cash and they wouldn't let us purchase a drink while we waited.  All the while everyone else is getting served, two guys at the bar, the people at tables, every person before us, but not us. Get your act together."}
{"text":"I've had several different doughnuts they offer......something always seems to be missing. Like, they should taste better for the types of options they have. I should not be underwhelmed by a bacon doughnut. That is just not normal. OK coffee, meh service."}
{"text":"First off I am not a hot dog person at all...but one amazing truck called Short Leash Hot Dogs has changed my life forever! Amazing, creative, unique and delicious are only a few descriptions I can say about these dogs.   I was first introduced to Short Leash Hot Dogs through the Yelp science fair when they were handing out samples of their corn pups to everyone in line and thought they were super delicious, little did I know what other creations they had up their sleeve! I came across them again at the Devoured Culinary Classic where I got to try different samples and I also saw they encourage you to send them pictures of your dog so they can feature them with a special hot dog! Being the dog lover that I am, I sent one of the owners, Brad, an email the next day with a picture of my Siberian Husky named Sky.   At the end of May Sky was the featured dog of the week with his own special hot dog made up of grilled pears, romaine lettuce, bacon, and blue cheese dressing. I was told it was hit, so I decided to take the pup with me downtown and get a chance to meet them and try the delicious hot dog!  I have also tried other hot dogs on their menu, and you may be a little hesitant about some of the combinations of different ingredients, but trust me... they know exactly what they are doing and you will not be disappointed with any choice you make! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to try Short Leash Hot Dogs just once, even if you are not a hot dog kind of a person!"}
{"text":"In town with friends visiting and decided to go to the food truck event today. Saw short leash hot dog truck and decided to try it out. We tried the Aioki dog with mango chutney, the naan bread is a great idea however the dogs were very small for the price. The mango chutney and mayo was not a good combination and the mango chutney was too chunky more like a salsa. Also had a plain hot dog and the dog was crunchy which was a bit odd to me having eaten hot dogs my whole life. The hotdogs would have tasted better just steamed and not grilled afterwards made it too dry. The staff is overall friendly. They gave a free sample of there fried pickles to try and they were okay."}
{"text":"REALLY good!!!!  Found them at Food Truck Friday at the Phoenix Public Market.  A bit pricey for just a plain dog... but some REALLY interesting choices!!!  Great naan/pita rather than a bun.  The man who waited on us was super friendly, smiling and seemed like he enjoyed what he did and working with people.  (They need to do a little customer service inservice for the Urban Cookies workers on Tuesdays!).  We will be back Short Leash!!!"}
{"text":"I can't freaking believe I haven't reviewed Short Leash yet!!!!!!!   I go pretty much every Friday to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market food truck court.  Is that a mouthful or what????? I make a beeline here.  Not only are these people totally kick-ass but so are the hot dogs. I try to get a different one each time, but I always end up with the one that's got the jalapenos on it.  I don't remember the names ever.  I am there to eat, not read, but I think it's the Igby. They have a new one I learned about last night, the \"Lady,\" and my mouth is watering right now at my desk.  I will be trying it out today for lunch. :} Oh, and when business owners remember the names of their customers, they are tops in my book.  After all, I may be eating their hot dog, but it's still....all about me.  ;}"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were watching a show about food trucks and heard about Short Leash-we had to try it out!  I'm not one for hot dogs, but I loved the food and the bread.  Very different combinations and the crowd was fun.  We also loved that when we went it was in a parking lot that had one of the Cupcake War winners' shops.  Had to stop there as well.  Yummo!  Just wish they were closer-as we live in Anthem which is easily a 30-45 minute drive."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lady with regular pickles instead of fried (gotta keep it gluten free) and a bratwurst. Yummy!! The chipotle cream cheese sauce drizzled over top gives a little kick and the sautéed onions added a little sweet. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see veggie dogs on the menu. Yaay!!!!   The dog was thin but the flatbread and toppings were amazing! I love the variety had the Aiko, the Lady and built my own with beans.  I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"For the dog lovers! We started enjoying the food truck hot dogs served on Naan instead of buns with fresh local ingredients including the dogs themselves years ago on Fridays at Phx Market. But now mostly go to their Sit-n-Stay restaurant at 3rd and Roosevelt. No worry figuring out where the truck will be! Dogs are named after their canine friends or those of clients (featured dog of the week). The Bear sounds strange, but is oh so wonderful...spicy beer hot with peanut butter, bbq, smoked gouda, ... and crackerjacks. Won the Dbacks hot dog contest as \"the seventh inning stretch\". My wife like the Moki (mayo, pintos, green chiles, cheddar and tomatoes). You can take your four-legged friend and sit on the patio and they will bring him or her a bowl of water."}
{"text":"Pros: lots of topping choices and you can add as many toppings as you want; fair price for a hot dog; if you are into low carbs or can't eat bread there is a \"naked dog\" option where you pay the same price as a regular hotdog but you get two meats and no bun  Cons: the buns are not traditional hot dog buns, but more of a pita-like bun which I didn't like that much; the fried pickles were cut a little too thick and therefore not that crispy  would I eat here again? sure, but not before trying all the other food trucks at the public market on Fridays"}
{"text":"Someone once told me that if you're going to preface a sentence with \"It goes without saying..\" then you should probably say it. So despite the plethora of superstar reviews, I am going to chip in and echo the feedback this magnificent food truck deserves.   Meatless dogs should taste like, well... meaty dogs. Let's face it, real hot dogs have a je ne sais quoi about them because you pretty much don't know what is in them. While I can't speak to the quality of the real meat hot dogs which are probably higher quality that Oscar Meyer and likely consist of real meat, I can tell you that buying veggie dogs from the store will never suffice again. No it's not that the roll of mystery non-meat is a superb mockup of actual meat, it's the furnishings. Who the heck thought of delicately and lovingly wrapping this cylindrical American staple in a fabulously plush piece of exotic non-American naan? These guys.   As for the toppings, I am so indecisive about choosing among the incredibly delicious options that I typically just tell them to surprise me so long as it's not bacon. Blue cheese? Well usually I'm vegan, but for this...yes. Cabbage? Um yes. And whatever that is on that guy's hot dog before me, I want that too. I have never finished consuming one of these hot dogs wanting anything more from life at that moment. So while \"it goes without saying,\" it's worth being said over and over. This is yum."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't typically like hot dogs....honestly, I hardly EVER eat one. The only other place I will order a hot dog is at Pinks in LA or Vegas.  We tried Short Leash for the first time Thursday night. For the month of October they are parked at Jam Market in Old Town every Thursday from 4PM-8PM. Since they mainly set up shop in Central Phoenix and we live in Arcadia, we decided this would be our best bet!  Holy delicious. It was honestly one of the best things I've had in a long time. After drooling over the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Aiko with a chicken dog. Brad was taking orders and when I told him I wanted to sub the mayo for spicy mustard, he was quick to offer up his suggestion of trying sriracha instead. I always appreciate when people give you their suggestions on what can make your meal that much better and the sriracha did just that...it was AMAZING. Now I like my food super spicy so I also added pepperoncinis and even got a little spicy mustard on the side.  Next up....fried pickles! These were awesome too! Thick cut and breaded perfectly! Now I'm a huge fried pickle fan (I like the chips VS the spears) and with not many valley spots offering up these tasty treats, I was super stoked they had them. I actually ended up dipping these in the spicy mustard...and sriracha. I know, I have problems.  Now my boyfriend on the other hand is a major hot dog fan, however, he typically doesn't stray too far from the standard hot dog with ketchup. Thursday night he decided to go with their featured special which was named after an adorable pup named Desi. This one came with a smoked Italian sausage, peppers, onions & garlic all slow cooked in a red wine tomato sauce and topped with shaved parmesan. He LOVED it. Cleaned his plate. I was somewhat skeptical of how he would like the naan that it comes on instead of a bun but it didn't phase him one bit!  Overall, we were two happy campers! The only thing I would love to see are french fries or tater tots gracing their menu!"}
{"text":"This food truck is DELICIOUS!  Everything is made with high quality ingredients, and I have yet to try something that I didn't love!  This place is not your normal take on the hot dog.  Though, if that's your fancy then you can still get it :)  I can't wait for the restaurant to open up on Roosevelt!"}
{"text":"Must Go-To Place if you are around.   Really loved all the different options for Hot Dogs, so many flavors.   We ordered much more than we could consume, because everything looked good. The price point was right (good value for your money).  Service was good too."}
{"text":"This place is SERIOUS about hot dogs!!  The flavor combinations are tasty, unique, harmonious and portions are huge!  I tried the Bear, which has, no lie, peanut butter, bbq sauce, smoked gouda cheese, bacon and CRACKER JAX!!  Peanut butter on a hot dog?  Sounds disgusting but is actually delicious!  Sweet/salty to the max!  A lot of people ordered the LADY, which has chipotle cream cheese, sautéed onions and their trademark FRIED PICKLES!!  They serve their hot dogs on Naan, which is like a thick soft pita and awesome!!  Service is awesome! Food is wonderful.  The only thing I tried and didn't like was their coleslaw - very dry and bland.  Not worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The regular cake doughnuts are the best!  They have this crunchy/moist/soft thing going that I have never experienced in a doughnut.  Glad I don't live anywhere near this place, I'd be too tempted."}
{"text":"Well, apparently, these are to die for. I am a diabetic, so I will never know. I had stopped by yesterday to get a little something for the awesome people that work the GI wing of the Phoenix VA. Had to park on the street. (Parking for small cars only) So my wife and I order two dozen, not looking at the prices. The guy moves a bit slow, but eventually, we do get the doughnuts. It didn't look like there was much to choose from, but when the total came up to $53.78, I thought, man, what's the deal with this place ? So, today, the day after, I get a call from one of the nurses that demanded to know where the doughnuts came from. I looked it up, gave her the name, number and address. She said that she saw that I live in Maricopa and told me that she would have driven out here for a doughnut. And I said, \"even at two bucks a doughnut\"?  You bet ! She said. So you go."}
{"text":"I thought the hot dog was good, but not $6 good. It would have been nice to have had a choice of a regular bun instead of the flat bread.   I am not sure why everyone is raving over this food truck. There are better alternatives for hot dogs in this city, especially if you are downtown."}
{"text":"I'll admit...I've always seen the hot dog as the lowest possible form of meat there is. Even as a kid, hearing playground rumors of what was actually in hot dogs struck me with fear and made the hot dog's more attractive cousin...the hamburger...a much more appealing option for stuffing into my gullet. Sure...I'd have a hot dog once a year or so when I was in the mood, or at the occasional baseball game. But for all intents and purposes, the hot dog was dead to me. Now, thanks to Short Leash Dogs my mild disdain of the hot dog has made a miraculous 180, rising from the recesses of my palette like a phoenix from the ashes.   How could a hot dog be so amazing?   Maybe it's the fresh and local ingredients...or the high quality dogs/sausages they use...or maybe it's the Naan bread. Whatever they're doing...they're doing it right, because when you bite into one of their unique dogs, it's like an explosion of flavor that can't even be compared to the type of hot dogs I grew up on.  So far we've tried a few different styles and they've all been uniquely tasty in their own way. My personal favorite is Beer Hot served Lady style...it might just be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Oh...and if it wasn't enough that their food is orgasmically good, the two owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Someone with a product this good has no right being so genuine and friendly. Honestly, they could be assholes and their food is good enough that it would probably still sell like hot cakes. When a restaurant (or food truck in this case) has amazing food that is matched with friendly service, it creates an environment you want to keep coming back to. Did I mention the prices are pretty cheap too?  Thank you to Short Leash Dogs I am now craving their hot dogs on a weekly basis, at the very least.  We love this place if you can't tell. If you haven't tried it already...GO NOW. My only hope is that they continue to expand and trek to more places around the valley more often...maybe even open up a brick and mortar location somewhere close to where I live; hey I can dream can't I?  5/5."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit Rollover Doughnuts. I love gourmet pastries, and the idea of gourmet doughnuts really hyped me up. When my boyfriend and I got to Rollover for the first time, we were at first very pleased: the building is super cute, the separate \"lobby\" (study/table room) is well-decorated and clean. But when we got up to the main building to order....  There was a huge swarm of tiny flies in the corner of the pastry case. RIGHT where all of the doughnuts were sitting. A few flies were buzzing around and landing on the doughnuts, but most of them were crawling over one another in the corner. I asked the cashier if there were any doughnuts that hadn't been sitting there all day, and he said with a very bored expression, \"Nope, that's all we have.\" Ummm, no. My boyfriend and I left.  Like I said, I really wanted to like Rollover....but that's absolutely disgusting. Isn't that a health code violation?"}
{"text":"Unique, unusual, out of the ordinary, different, all that and TASTY!! The chocolate donut had a lovely spice to it - a little bit cinnamon, ginger, maybe cardamom?? SO good with a chocolate walnut frosting. The orange-vanilla donut was all that - concentrated vanilla cake with a delicate orange/vanilla frosting. I'd hit them up again and again and again."}
{"text":"Ooooo-K! Looks like there is some pressure to give SLD a 5-star since every Elite did! ;-)  Yes, they deserved it! Ever tried a Gorilla dog at a Suns game? Well, there's really no comparison actually, except for its approximate 12-inch size.  The fusion of a simple, yet tasty Indian bread and the ever so popular American sausage really worked.  Upon ordering, you decide on their pre-set toppings, like 5 of them OR you can customize from 20 or so toppings.  The hot dog itself with any number of toppings is only $5.  The tricky part about customizing is understanding the flavors of each ingredient! So I had to carefully choose ones that made sense! :)  I was glad to see mushrooms on the list so I had them sauteed it.  Other ones I was happy to see were the spicy mustard and siracha!  My meal came with a bag of sea salted chips and a bottle of cold, pure sugar cane ginger ale, which was quite refreshing! My total was just $8.  If any personnel from the Phoenix Suns organization is reading this or have heard, I sure hope they would consider opening up one of these in their arena."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about Rollover since I'd really liked Shine Coffee which was the former resident of this location. Carrying over quite a bit of the wonderfully cheerful and efficient staff, having the same great coffee and tea, and substituting great tasting doughnuts for the great tasting pastries Shine offered works for me.  For the folks complaining about the variety of doughnuts, please take a look at the storefront. It's tiny! How many varieties do you think they can fit on their little counter? As for the people complaining there aren't any doughnuts left later in the day... that would be because their big doughnut business is in the beginning of the day for the breakfast crowd. A couple of doughnuts left over after sitting on the shelf in the display window at the end of the day and they're not fresh? Gee, why could that be?  How about this? Show up early at Rollover, get a doughnut or two (I can personally recommend the chocolate frosted, maple glazed, and maple glazed with bacon), have a big cup of hot or iced coffee or tea, and just relax.  Oh, and as a seasonal (fall) tip, try the pumpkin spice latte with a maple glazed with bacon doughnut. No need to thank me. Just enjoy this perfectly decadent combination."}
{"text":"Ah, Rollover Donuts. You make my Friday mornings zing. Your dozen assorted donuts make me both the envy and the ire of the office. And those delightful taste combinations make my taste buds sing like an opera.  Conveniently located right off the Encanto light rail stop, Rollover has been a payday Friday staple for our office. The maple glazed bacon lured me in, the Tahitian coconut and orange pistachio and, really, any other combination keep me coming back. I've been fortunate enough to get here right when they open and easily score a terrific assortment of these fried delectable delights. While donuts don't fit in to the revolving office diet, at least I'm assured to have a delish sweet treat throughout the day.  Can't wait for their downtown location to open!"}
{"text":"Hate to call it a food truck because it felt like so much more. I think they are definitely more gourmet than the image that is conjured up when the the words hot dog or food truck are put together in a sentence. I had just a basic dog in a pita and it was delicious. Service was friendly and fast! More than just a hot dog!"}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 star reviews, so the fact I am giving a food truck 5 stars is significant.  Let me start out by saying I cannot recall having eaten a hot dog since age 6.  I haven't wanted to, nor have I caved... even at a ballpark when \"everyone else is eating one.\"  Today DD and I called Short Leash, found out where they were camped out and headed down to Urban Cookies lot to try them out.  My daughter is a hot dog connoisseur.  I mean this literally.  My parents actually started a hot dog cart business in her honor when they lived in PA.  She is very picky when it comes to her dogs.  Today we ordered the kid's dog - plain - and a veggie dog, Moki style with no mayo.  We also ordered two of the cheese corn pups.  DD said the hot dog was delicious and the best dog ever.  She said she loved the flatbread.  Okay, she called it pita... but still.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I bit into my dog, but I finished the whole thing!  Delicious.  The owner came and chatted with me for a bit and recommended the chicken dog for my next visit.  I asked if it had a pork casing and he said no... so I will try it out.  I loved the Moki preparation, though.  I love this place and I hope they offer a franchise to someone in the East Valley so I can get it more often.    Yes, it was THAT good.  Get over to Short Leash ASAP!  They have their locations listed on their website a month ahead of time.  I've printed the month of June out already!  Now if only I can get my dog to be featured..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a dog, they are quick and not to bad in price.  Their truck is actually a small trailer and they have have bottled soda in a bucket of ice.  My favorite that I order all the time is the  Bratwurst Moki. The Bratwurst is placed on a pita flat bread and topped off with the Moki concoction that includes roasted green chilis, sautéed onions, tomatoes, pinto beans and cheese. The combination is perfect and a treat to eat.  No frills and a good amount of food.  Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog! - Rufus Thomas said it waaaaay back when, but I'm saying it now.  I'll walk a dog and anything else a long way to have one of these creative tasty delicious hot dogs.  It all dates back to my childhood when I thought a hot dog, boiled in a pot of water, on an unassuming bun with a squirt of mustard and a dash of ketchup was the best a dog could get.  Then I went to Chicago/New York during my undergrad years only to  discover that more than ketchup and mustard can go on a hot dog and make it taste REAL good.  So, as my hot dog paradigm is making another shift... I want to recognize and give the appropriate YELP-out to Short Leash Dogs!  This place is quite simply Ah-mazing.  They put \"stuff\" together on a hot dog that I never would have imagined putting together across meals in the same day!  But these interesting toppings together  taste sooo good on a hot dog from SLD!  I've had exactly 3 hot dogs from this place and each time I'm amazed that, not only did I like the dog, I LOVED IT!  The most interesting thus far has to be the Bear hot dog.   I had it prepared Naked (that's no bun, 2x the hot dog) with the spicy hot dog.  The bear has Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce on it.  Yes, you read it correctly!  Cracker Jacks and Peanut butter... If this is your first time around the block, I'm sure we had the same first thought - Are they serious?  Oh, but yes... serious as a dog about his bone!   The flavors in the bear meld together in your mouth and the taste bursts with the peanut butter and the cracker jack, just enough salty with the sweet; nutty with the mild flavor of the cheese.  I would recommend this dog to anyone!  When you go, look for the special of the week.  I think upon my next visits, I will always have the special of the week OR I will try my own hand at creating my own dog.  Be sure to try the very delicious fried pickles.    To boot, the folks working in this food truck are top-notch folks.  I find that most if not all food truck owners/employees are extremely pleasant.  Wag your tail on over to their website and check out the calendar and see where you can find their trailor.  I just heard that they have a new true bonafide truck.  Don't you want to break it in?"}
{"text":"Out of all the donut shops in Arizona, made the decision to try this place while visiting last week and I must say it was definitely the right decision!   Their donuts are AMAZING!! Tried a lot of them, but the orange pistachio one was my favorite! The worker was extremely friendly and helpful. There was a little cute side room where you can enjoy your coffee and donuts. It has the cutest decor and was filled with a few board games to play and books to read while you were there.   If I ever get the chance to come back to Arizona, I will definitely be returning here."}
