{"text":"Great spot. Good food. Friendly staff. Enjoyed my first visit this morning for breakfast. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want to spend the better part of your morning waiting for cold, overcooked food, this is the place to go.  We pretty much experienced the same service as J.J..  We will never be back."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys going here for meals.  We have had both breakfast and dinner on several occasions.  The breakfast menu has your typical breakfast items with a few special touches that makes them unique. Example, the french toast is coated in corn flakes making them a little crunchy, the eggs benedict is different since they use corn bread instead of english muffin.  They have great hamburgers and chicken fried steak.  Must try the chicken cordon blue sandwich.  This is a great place to try if your looking to get away from the long wait lines at chain restaurants."}
{"text":"When it was LW's this place was great, definitely not now!! I had heard the food was no longer as good but we still decided to give it a shot. I'm not sure what changed besides the name but half the food was burnt and sevice was HORRIBLE. We came mid-morning on May 28th, there was no wait when we arrived. We were sat right away but had to wait 10-15 minutes for anyone to come by to greet us and take our drink order. It was another 45 minutes to get our food once we ordered. Our server (who i believe was also the bartender) never came back to check on us, other servers eventually brought out our food, we had to ask for silverware, our food was dry and burnt, the eggs on the Ranch Hand Benedict were basically hard boiled... and we heard other tables around us complaining about these same things. This is not the LW's we used to love."}
{"text":"Love the food! I enjoyed the chicken pot pie even though it's not traditional. Good size portions."}
{"text":"Met friends for a late Sunday breakfast and everyone loved it!!! We had the French toast and both burrito options and all were fantastic!! Totally unique breakfast menu items and we can't wait to go back and try more! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish that Campbell's could get service to balance with its kitchen.  We were seated at 10:05 this morning and no one had even come up to our table by 10:25.  Food showed up at 10:50.  OK, it's New Year's morning.  OK, you're short staffed.  But it's the same thing every time we come there."}
{"text":"Few things:

1. Fire your cook immediately!
2. Find a calendar and mark Memorial Day as a holiday!
3. I'm telling 10 friends to not eat at your very slow establishment (who might tell 10 more people)
4. Lower the salary of who owns this place, because they need to hire 5 more people"}
{"text":"It's a biker bar.  Drunk biker girl had to be hauled off, she should have been cut off much earlier.   Do not recommend if you want a quiet lunch.
Seating uncomfortable, decent food, chilli did not have any flavor, pulled pork sandwich was tastey, but the bread was soggy.  The cornbread was awesome, beer was cold.
The server, Adrian, was excellent."}
{"text":"The food is great, very good size portions. The service is good, I got the bacon wrapped chicken and my wife chose the caujan shrimp! We will be coming back!!

Also, there is a buy one meal and get one free in the Savvy Shopper, look for it cause we only paid 25 for all that food, including the cobbler!!!"}
{"text":"Great, hometown restaurant. Happy servers, food that you can taste was made from scratch. A little small so there's a wait when it's busy. The cornballs are amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at JD's for breakfast, brunch, lunch and happy hour.  We loved everything we had from the chicken fried steak to the potato Benedict. We have invited friends to meet us for happy hour and tried almost everything they offered, everyone enjoyed themselves.

{"text":"I got the corned beef sandwich it was great good sour kraut and meat on a crispy marble rye bread also my brother got the cheese steak it looked delicious and I heard it was my only problem is that it could use a lot less flys and better service I ordered sweet potato fries and got French fries that weren't sweet potato other then that not bad"}
{"text":"Long needed west side breakfast joint...just wish I had done it first eggs sausage yum. Bloody Mary's were just ok. That's why it only gets 4 stars"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!  i went in to pick up my phone order.  I watched the cooks in the back making the food.  I was waiting for my eggs.  one of the cooks (short hispanic male)  i watched him take his cell phone out and check it (disgusting, germs, he plays his games while he using the toilet and all his disgusting germs) puts it back in his pocket and scoops the eggs out of the pan with his HANDS!!!  NEVER AGAIN, WILL I BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE, I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT EITHER, NEXT EMAIL IS TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.  after i complained he put on 1 glove!  ONE!  whoever the owner is, you need to lock this down.  I am going to all health department online, phone and even by written letter if i have to.  I will not stop until either this restaurant get an  \"F\" or shuts down, or if your lucky the get there shit together!!!!   YOU LOST A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!!

{"text":"We've driven past this place tons of times.  It's always packed so we tried it out this morning and it was AMAZING!  We were greeted and seated instantly, had a phenomenal wait person.  The food was excellent - sweet potato pancakes were stellar. Nothing but awesome all around!!

The funky deco - lots of animal heads - adds to the fun here."}
{"text":"best burgers in north america! I have trepidation giving review because more people will come, however happy hour's apps are fabulous like cheeseburger sliders, corn fritters are unique
 tasty and if you're a soup lover they have amazing vegy soup. It's our go- to diner. The owner has same name as my wife."}
{"text":"Tried to go for Mother's Day brunch only to find out it was reservation only. Pretty upsetting considering there was no mention of reservations on the sign we see everyday when we drive by. We didn't go for Easter brunch because the in-laws were worried about the wait because of NO reservations. After convincing them to go here for Mother's day, we thought it would also be nice to walk from our house, a quarter mile away, only to have to turn around and walk back, with empty stomachs... Doesn't seem like the \"Sunday brunch\" idea works for this place, and I guarantee we will never try to attend another.

Generally speaking, LW's is a decent place to grab a basic bite to eat and a good beer. The Bloody Mary's have always been good, was just really hoping to have one this morning...

We ended up going to Lakeside Bar and Grill, where they always have room."}
{"text":"We are so pleased with this place every time we come! We've always been here for breakfast bit tried dinner tonight and we're happy we did so. Excellent enchiladas, my daughter loved her spaghetti, and my \"Merc\" burger was fantastic...the green chile had great flavor, the burger was a spot-on medium as requested, and the bacon was perfect, not dry and crumbly like you would normally get. They were also very attentive and accommodating with my gluten and dairy allergies."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. The service leaves much to be desired. Took 20 minutes to find out they were out of soup. Took another 20 minutes to get the replacement chili. The chili came out with no cheese or cornbread. We were told that was what was ordered when in fact that was not true. A few minutes later, less then 5 minutes the salad and both meals came out. Now we have a table full of food where as for approximately 30 minutes we had nothing. I am getting really tired of people who take no pride in the way the do their jobs."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing hometown feel! My first time here and I feel like I've been coming here for years. Best wings I've ever had and great, friendly service with a smile. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Two of us went for dinner on Sunday 9/10. Food was LEGIT. We ordered the brisket, with veggies and the pork loin/chops with rice and asparagus. The veggies were roasted and not steamed or boiled so they were fantastic and not mushy like at other places. Keep up the good work because this is a local place where we can get a home cooked meal. The server was hustling but never ignored us. Carrot cake was good. SO good. The only thing I would suggest is the guy playing the guitar could be a little quieter. He was amazing though - singing recent country and his voice is amazing and not twangy. Keep it up Campbells! We are trying breakfast this weekend."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice decor for the area, prices are just \"ok\",. The only complaint is
Neither myself or my friend liked the coleslaw and couldn't finish eating it . 
New place so it might take time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"1 star because I can not go lower. My family and I have been going here for a couple of years. Mostly for breakfast. It was never 5 star but it wasn't bad. After today I think that they have lost my business. Sat down ordered water and cofee. Coffee was cold...no biggie got some fresh. I didn't think much of it but it was a portent of the future. We ordered food.. French toast biscuits and gravy and country fried steak. Waited for a long time as they were pretty busy. When the food came out the gravy on both the biscuits was refrigerator cold. Sent it back. Started to eat my chicken fried steak. It was luke warm. I think the same cold gravy that was on the biscuits was put on my steak as well. The eggs with the steak were also cold. Cold gravy is a health hazard. Cold eggs are as well. We didn't send the steak back as I was no longer hungry and our server said that they will take some money off of the bill. So I was like well that's good at least try to make it right . Total taken off for serving 2 plates of cold food? $1.88 on a $40 tab. They should be ashamed. Mostly for serving food that can make people very ill and secondly for what truly amounts to a \"I don't care about you as a customer\" attempt at making things right. I am not asking for a comp but $1.88? Really? And that was from the manager. That's just insulting."}
{"text":"Service was poor. The wait staff was nice but they weren't attentive. Never filled my drink that kind of stuff. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with 2 over easy eggs and potatoes. The gravy was really thin and the biscuits were hard and crunchy. My eggs we definitely over easy as the white was still really runny. I ordered French toast and had them take my plate away. The French toast was much better. My moms scrambled eggs were over cooked. We won't be returning. I gave 3 stars because the atmosphere was nice. The restaurant was clean. But the food was not great and the service was sub par."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there often, the staff is friendly and the food is great.  The owners make awesome desserts, but you have to try the Ding Dong cake...phenomenal!!!  

They are open for breakfast and have football on Sundays!

They have chicken fried steak, huge omelets actually filled with meats and veggies, not all egg.  I love the waffles, I usually have my eggs sunny side up and sandwich them in between.  Really good.

Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place serving breakfast only on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday's. It gets busy so go early. Food is great with generous portions and decently priced. Country look atmosphere dining."}
{"text":"Not what is once was. Wendy and Lita worked hard to make this a great place. Now Campbell got rid of the two girls, longer wait time for food, portions are decreasing, and pricing is going up. The morale is ok at best. Just ask the girls working there if you want the scoop. Word is he's now going to make it more upscale.....SURPRISE a Morton's your not. Keep it local, simple, and good, with great service and we (all the locals) will continue to support you. If not, see ya..."}
{"text":"we have visited this restaurant many times and have always had a good meal. We love the salads, breakfasts, and burgers.  Have we had a meal that was not our favorite, Yes, mainly due to seasoning that we are not particularly fond of ( rosemary). But I did eat it all. Next time I will know to hold the rosemary.  We love that we have a small local home style restaurant in our neighborhood.  The only reason we did not give five stars is that most of the servers are great but there have been times where certain servers are having a bad day and bring that to their performance but yet the next time are spot on.  We will continue to go and tell our friends."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. Rude stand off staff. My girlfriend and I came in and ordered biscuits and gravy and she ordered eggs. It took 35 mins after our order to be put in to see our server and I asked if there just was a back up in the kitchen and she was like uhhh sorry I put it in when you ordered and there is still two tickets ahead of you. Your just going to have to wait and walked away. Don't waste your time go to haymakers right around the counter better food better service better everything!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices on food and drinks. They have a lot of specialty drinks that were all very good. I especially like the salted caramel drink. They have unique takes on traditional bar food. We ordered the  cheesesteak sandwich, which was hot and very flavorful. The spinach artichoke dip did not really have much artichoke, but was good and had a bit of a kick. We also ordered the brownie, which was awesome. It would have been perfect if it had a better quality ice cream served with it. We sat outside and watched the sun go down over the mountains."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts and kid friendly here! We always get great customer service and enjoy coming here. 

I tried something new with the cowboy Benedict and unfortunately will stick to what I normally order as I wasn't a fan of the potato cakes."}
{"text":"I found this place as I was driving by for work....it is a quaint saloon type looking restaurant and bar.  It has limited seating and seems to cater to alot of locals that know the owner as well as each other.  I ordered the chicken fried steak based on a recommendation and although it  was crispy like I like....I came to find out after returning 2 mornings after that the previous piece I was served was burnt and a runt of the litter!!!  My wife and I BOTH ordered the CFS and it was fantastic....ALOT better than my previous experimental order.  We returned a few days later after church service to bring our daughter....MAN was it PACKED!!!!  We wound up waiting approximately 50 minutes!!!  Never realized that it would actually take what we were estimated when we checked in!  Thru the endless groans and whining of my daughter we were sat and she was VERY pleasantly surprised!  She did state she would never rather wait so long but was happy with the food and DEFINITELY the service!  I gave the three stars due to the fact I was served such an inferior CFS upon my first visit, I felt the chef, prep cook, and server SHOULD have caught this before it being served because if it were served to another individual, such as my wife, it would have been sent back immediately upon casting eyes upon."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for breakfast.  The potato cakes, big ole breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich were awesome and very reasonably priced.  I will be frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service, prices not bad.
However, food is bland. I ordered the breakfast burrito and had little taste. Very little egg or cheese, mostly potato. :("}
{"text":"Great Fritata.  Great Chicken Fried Steak.  Although I read of someone having a bad time with the Bloody Marry, mine was great."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I've been looking for since moving to Arizona. If you're looking for where the locals go, this is it! I've always gone for a late breakfast but their menu has all tastes. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs, New York strip, are just eh. Good quality not that great. Maybe breakfast is better..."}
{"text":"The food has gotten better every time. Most restaurant's get cheaper on food. Not here! The service is friendly, environment small town AZ and the menu is awesome and has something for everyone. Going back for the Pork Chop. Phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Tumbleweed breakfast burrito is my go-to! Chicken fried steak, white gravy, eggs, sausage and potatoes all rolled up! What more could you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"I was curious about this place since we moved here.  We stopped in on a weeknight around 8 pm and we were pleasantly surprised; judging by the exterior you'd guess it is a biker bar, probably smelly and dingy - but it was actually comfortable and pleasant.  Family friendly too - they even offer a very long breakfast on weekends.  It's very small though, not much seating at the bar, and the rest of the restaurant feels more like a homegrown Denny's.  The service was great, and we would have happily stayed later but unfortunately the place cleared out and they closed very early... I will probably stop in again on the weekend!  Inexpensive drinks and nice people."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed our dinners at J.D. Campbell, we went Friday and my girlfriend ordered the fish and chips which were good, I ordered the Briskets, I could not believe how much pieces of fat were in the dish, there was more fat than meat, the meat was burnt in small pieces I had a hard time finding to eat, I told the waitress about this after the meal and she said that was too bad and left. I really like this place to have dinner but will think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience ever... I'm rewriting this to not waste the readers time like the Resturant did of my family's and my time. Below are why I am still irritated 10 hours later at this morning experience and mind you I have eaten here 6 times in the last 2 weeks with my family.
Today's issues
1. Waiting 30 minutes for a seat as people arriving after us with same or more people were seated ahead of us when told 2 groups ahead.
2. Sat at a booth to small for the four of us when asked to be sat outside when there was a table avail and a larger booth avail
3. Waiting 15 mins more before being acknowledged by our server
4. Waiting another 10 for beverages to return to be served the worse coffee in my life. Cold bad coffee during breakfast rush hmmm
5. Waited another 30 minutes to watch people sat after us being served and finishing with still no server checking on us
6. Going and asking for answers and being told by the person beside the kitchen and orders I'll have to wait 
7. A server arguing with my wife that we have only been waiting for 25 minutes but she will see how much longer
8. When finally getting a manager I appreciate a gesture of bagging up our food to go as you see my wife storm out after being insulted by your server. And you might have offered to try to make it right
10. Insult a man and his family with a free meal after waiting an hour
11. And the worse part of them all is during the entire time there my wife and I felt that a lot of it was based on the fact we were not of the same complication as everyone else around us just had all the signs of a server and some ignorant and bigot motives but I hope that was not the case and she was having a bad day.

That was my morning at JD Campbell. Am I exaggerating I really wish I was. Am I still angry about the experience no I'm still angry that a professional establishment allows patrons who have returned multiple times and people in general this way it is just sad.. Great food all the other times, horrible server and experience this time"}
{"text":"What happened? Where are the two women who made this place hum? The wait staff is gloomy..some dude is now running the place. We live 1
 block away, have made this our local diner...but no more. So sad, but there are other places, like Haymaker...anywhere but LWs....even Dennys is better! Money is not an object with us, but when you go to a place and get lousy food and a wait staff that looks down in the dumps, you know something is wrong. So so sad."}
{"text":"JD Campbells was recommended by a friend.  So we came to try it out for breakfast.  The place was really packed inside and out so we were pretty excited when we arrived.  The building is a former gas station/supply store back before there was anything out this way heading towards Lake Pleasant.  

The inside looks and feels like an old saloon.  There seemed to be too many tables and chairs inside as it was impossible to walk to our table without bumping in to other tables and chairs of other parties.  The table next to us had a chair from our table to fit their party so I basically had a kids head in my lap which he continued to lean back literally hovering his head over my table.  Another person attempted to move out of the way and spilled their drink on the ground.  There's really no need to cram so many people in one area.  They should consider removing a few tables and chairs and make it more manageable and more comfortable for their guests.  

I ordered a tumbleweed burrito which came with potatoes, country fried steak, eggs, cheese, and peppers and gravy.  My wife ordered scrambled eggs with onions peppers and cheese.  The burrito was disappointing all around.  The tortilla was store bought and pasty, the potatoes tasted old and reheated, the country fried steak was tough and chewy, and the gravy was bland.  My wife had gobs of thick cheese she had to remove before she could eat her eggs.   Neither of us finished our meals.  All of it was low quality and sloppily put together.

It's just baffling that as we were leaving people were lined up out front and the parking lot was packed.  Maybe it's not them, maybe it's us?  I am not sure but I'm not going to waste any more time trying to figure it out.  I would not come back here and do not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day Breakfast. It was phenomenal. Hubby had the French Toast and I had the Potato Cakes. Can you say YUM?"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food and the service is great. Try the corn nuggets and the pot pie!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. This may not be the right word to describe my experience at LW's, but it's the first word that comes to mind.

My family and I came for breakfast on a fairly busy Sunday morning. The restaurant was at about 2/3 capacity at the time we arrived. There was a table of two ahead of us. Tables were visibly cleared and ready for service, but there was still a 15 minute wait. I understand staggering tables to avoid overloading the kitchen, but at the very least, we could have been sat.

After we were sat, it took a good 10 minutes for our server to stop by our table. There also seemed to be a little confusion internally about who out server was. We had two servers arrive at our table at the exact same time. One of them bowed out and we placed our drink and food orders at the same time.

The food arrived in a timely manner. Everything was hot, prepared fresh, and presented appropriately for a restaurant of this type. The overall food quality was very average and not very well seasoned. I believe this may be intentional, due to the fair amount of Sun City residents that dine here.
 
Chicken Fried Steak:

Average quality. Very heavy, flavorless breading. Standard frozen CFS product. The gravy lacked salt and the biscuits were average quality thaw and serve biscuits. The potatoes were a big let down for me. The cut on the potatoes was unique. They were neither a hash brown nor a country-style potato. More of a rectangle shaving of potato. Unfortunately, they were only about half cooked (still partially crunchy) and lacked any sort of seasoning.

Overall:

The service was slow and the food was mediocre. For what came out to $15.00 per person for breakfast, it was very underwhelming. I am glad to see another non-chain dining option in the NW Valley, but do not know if we will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the breakfast here. They only serve breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. I got the steak skillet special, it was excellent,good portion size. Service was very quick and waitstaff was courteous, my wife ordered the Fratatta of the day and was also very pleased with that selection. Have been here previously and had the French toast which is unique and very good as well, would recommend Campbells to anyone who is interested in a good meal at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Went up there on a Sunday to grab a quick bite to eat. The game was playing, the environment was great. The food I ordered was past my expectations. It's all around just a great place to go with the family or to just swing by and have a few."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I would have given this a much better rating if we were not waiting for so long when there was several empty tables that just weren't being cleared off. I don't think they had enough servers. 

The food was really good and the price was great. I had the frosted flakes French toast and they were grrrrreat just as they claimed. My kids had omelette and beef with green chili enchiladas. They were impressed with the food. My husband wasn't too impressed with pancakes. Felt they were dry. 

The atmosphere is super local-feeling. It's casual and welcoming. We will come again to see if next experience is better. Perhaps this was a fluke day. Service was ok. A little slow but like I said, they may have been short staffed."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this adorable place !!! Our serve Nicole was awesome!!! Our coffee was never empty and she was attentive and soo pleasant!!!  We met friends for breakfast and all of us had their AMAZING blueberry pancakes ... what a funky, fun little jewel of a place !!  We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! The specials are always excellent too. Not too pricey.. A fun place with some history and a cozy cabin feel."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places is Peoria. Great dinners, always changing specials and the best breakfast around. Great service and a fun local hang out. Anyone in the area should check it out. It's had a great story behind it too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are great!  A perfect place to catch a game, some suds, and some great food.  Love the buffalo burger and chili nachos."}
{"text":"Awful service. Got our drinks, never saw our waitress again, paid for our drinks and left. She's not to blame though, as she was the only server on staff DURING THE LUNCH RUSH!!!! If you like a restaurant that's so poorly staffed that they can't function during a rush, then this place is right up your alley."}
{"text":"Went there at 11:30 Saturday morning for a burger, waitress informed us they only serve breakfast up to 1:00. Come on man!"}
{"text":"Great local breakfast place in the area. I'm a big supporter of small businesses so highly recommend this place. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Outdoor seating is nice during the beautiful weather. 
They always have a new special which is typically quite yummy! You might have to try it as it won't come back around! 
My favorite is the potato cakes with a poached egg on top. I can't seem to deviate from it every time I eat here. Their green chili pork omelet is delicious as well. It's great to have some different breakfast options rather not than the traditional items. FYI- Weekends after 9:30 they seem to be quite busy."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day; $20 per person (all you can eat). Reservations were required, which we had. We were seated immediately. They had a brunch buffet layout. The food trays were kept exposed with no cover to lock-in the moisture. Overall, the majority of the food was extremely dry and rubbery. The meat was tough and hard to cut. What a disappointment for a place with a great atmosphere and nice staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks after a ball game.  So nice that you can sit outside on the porch and we were impressed to see two horses feeding at the hitching post out back.  Drinks were good, home made salsa was tasty. Chicken cordon bleu sandwich was marginal, brisket was tasty.  House salad was really good and the chicken pot pie was huge!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the corn beef hash and eggs over medium.  Eggs were over hard and the corn beef hash wasn't even recognizable. Tasted horrible.  Breakfast burrito was pretty good. Service was slow and horrible.  Will probably not return."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast in the middle of a residential neighborhood in north west Phoenix."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  We were so disappointed when we pulled up to what we thought was LW's hideaway, and found JD Campbells instead (actually we were hopeful, then disappointed).  

On the advice of the server, I ordered the brisket, which was supposed to be a specialty.  In my entire life, that is the worst thing I have ever tried to eat, not even a close second.  Tough, smoked to death and far past edible.  Still pissed off I didn't send it back, but was surprised that when the server came back and saw a full plate, she had nothing to say.  My wife ordered a sandwich and it was at best acceptable, surely not worth what they charged for it."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new breakfast place because The Good Egg just isn't cutting it anymore. Have driven past this little place tons of time never considered stopping till I found it listed here on Yelp.

Excellent menu. Great service. The food is incredible! Got the Frosted Flakes crusted French Toast. (yes, it is as absurd as it sounds.)

Here's my new breakfast place near home!"}
{"text":"There are many choices when you take a family of 5 out for a late lunch.  This place has great food and a staff that enjoys what they do and make you feel like you are a guest!!"}
{"text":"Nice place,  reminds me of an old western town. There is seating inside and outside on the porch. We sat inside in a booth which was large and comfortable, there was 4 of us. The waitress was friendly and prompt. Everybody ordered breakfast except for me, I had lunch.  The guys had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which was very large and had no gristle.  The French Toast was dipped in egg and cream with cinnamon and then rolled in crushed flakes, I tried a couple bites and it was wonderful!  I had the Southwest Chicken Salad which was big and fresh with corn, black beans, bacon and tomatoes, it was great and filling.  Very large portions! 
It has a great western atmosphere!  We went on a Sunday around noon and was seated immediately and everyone was attentive and made sure they said good morning and have a good day when leaving!"}
{"text":"Hello-

The Good-
This is a great place to have and drink and unwind. The western atmosphere is casual and comfortable. 
The Bad- My husband and I ordered the baby back ribs and they were so tough we couldn't cut through them!! $22.00 bucks for bad food. The waitress didn't even come back to ask how the food was. We had to ask for silverware so we could eat. We ordered drinks and they never showed up.  Soooo do not order the ribs or expect good service at LW's Hide-A-Way."}
{"text":"I've often wondered where the worlds worst server worked, and today I found her!

Wrong drink served to me. Asked for Diet Coke and she brought regular Coke. Then she brings back the correct drink but walked away without giving us straws. I went and got them myself from the bar. 

A few minutes later I ask her if we can order. She walks away while I'm talking to her over to another nearby table who was seated after us and proceeds to take their order instead

To her credit our food did come out first. The only problem?  Our order ends up looking beautiful. It just too bad it was at the wrong table...

Buh-bye LW's. FYI, I think it stands for \"lousy waitress\""}
{"text":"In town visiting family. Wanted to grab a bite.  Always try to pick something local. 
Immediately greeted and seated by a friendly employee.  
Our waitress was very good. Food was good, very filling.  Great portions. Another employee noticed my water was low, refilled it quickly.  Love that.
I noticed an older man, in the background.  Spoke to a couple tables (guessing owner, as he knew the tables by name) never approached us (which is totally fine, we are not locals) 
Overall,  I'd eat here again and recommend it. 
The carrot cake was DELICIOUS.  Probably the best I've ever had. Seriously,  and my kid orders it 8 out of 10 times. Hands down the best."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour for our food, and the food was pretty awful. This place was so much better before it became Campbell's. This is corned beef hash? I think not....dry as hell chunks of fried potatoes with cubed corned beef that was mostly fat and onions that were almost raw. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now. The first three were lunch or dinner and I was less than impressed. The food is just average and the service is too. Although I wasn't going back again, I decided to try breakfast because the server last time said they were known for it. Well it's no better. The coffee is not good! Although I admit breakfast is better than their lunch/dinner there are dozens of better places to chose from. And again, the service is inattentive. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice patio and friendly service but the food quality today left something to be desired.   Requested medium rare burger,  received one well done with some charing.  Asked for bacon on burger,  none added.  Fries were crunchy and good -  fresh."}
{"text":"This place has its charm. The sweet corn nuggets were definitely delicious! I also ordered the cajun shrimp Alfredo.  It was okay. I'm not sure I would go back here when there is so much good food in town."}
{"text":"I checked all the reviews for the ZIP Code that I live in , which is 85373 . JD Campbell's came up with the highest rating on yelp.
So we decided to give it a try.... wow will definitely be going back again the food was great customer service was great the atmosphere was great just a very very pleasant experience. I tried one of the special s of the day.
I ordered the blueberry waffle and bacon,the blueberry waffle was huge and probably had half a pint of blueberries in it probably the best waffle I've ever had. We went on a Sunday morning around 10:30 AM and the restaurant was packed. We will be going back again to try the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"Tasty food! just moved into the neighborhood we have been there a few times the service the food everything was top notch. it's a little old wood building that even has a real estate office upstairs just a lot of locals."}
{"text":"JD Campbell's formally called LW's Hide-A-Way used to be an Old Country Store and was converted into a restaurant back in 2013. The atmosphere is Wild West with wood and trophies. The grub isn't fancy but they have been known to serve up some killer specials that were priced right and they are well known for a special burger menu.

It kills me to lower my rating for this restaurant since I enjoyed some killer specials here. 

I note that I am not lowering the stars after one not so good visit and am lowering the stars after a couple not so good visits. On my last visit I tried a special that tasted awful. I just figured they screwed that one up.

My last dinner here was the Blackened Salmon. I've had this dinner on the menu before. Last time I had the same dinner the fish had a great texture, could have passed for fresh, tasted great and the sides were prepared nicely.

This time when I had it I can tell a different story. The fish had a crumbly weird texture and didn't have the same taste. Last time the vegetables were pretty good but this time if you take the time to look at my current photo you can see the vegetables might have came out of the microwave without seasoning or anything. Nobody likes zucchini just warmed up from the microwave. The macaroni and cheese really was awful. It was so overcooked it was gooey pasta. The sauce tasted like blue box thined down with a smokey bbq sauce that was added or possibly just fell into the pot. 

The food was so bad I almost started to cry.

I asked if they have a different cook and was told nothing has changed. (???????????)

I didn't give one star because my husband wants to try them again since we had many nice meals here.

You might do best ordering breakfast or a sandwich here."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times and always for lunch. I've ordered different things each time and I have to say I've always been pleased. The food is decent, the prices are reasonable and the service has been excellent every time. 
This is a wonderful place to meet friends for a casual meal! I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood watering hole!  Enjoyed the food and the old west atmosphere.  We will be back...
Plan on trying out their breakfast!"}
{"text":"We like this place because it's down the street from our house, the patio is nice, and the food is edible- most of it. It can be fairly inconsistent and the waitstaff can be a bit unstable. The burgers are ok, my kid likes the chicken tenders, but I wouldn't order anything beyond that. The ribs are greasy and fatty, the brisket the same. It's a good place for a bite and some atmosphere, but if you are looking for a 5 star meal this is not the place."}
{"text":"I have been there several times in the past two months.   Never a regret!!   The service is fast and friendly, and the food is always great.  I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have tried several menu and daily specials.   This past Saturday's Frittata was especially delicious.   We plan on returning again this week."}
{"text":"Sorry...looks like the Campbells have taken over.  Lita and Wendy are gone and the place is definitely lacking management.  Burgers were still done well, but the waitresses we used to see are all replaced.  And not for the good.  Business is still strong, but it won't stay that way if this afternoon was any indication."}
{"text":"This place has really picked up its game!

We are now happy with our last two visits and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool setting but not to much that was truly special in regard to the bar area. They service was \"ok\" and the beer was beer. I don't there is something about watching the bartender drink more then me that was a little bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Such a nightmare! We had been dying to try this place as it has a beautiful curb appeal. So we went recently. Wish we hadn't. Started off with being seated. The booth benches are rickety so when the 5 kids sitting behind us were jumping on their seats, we got to feel all of it. Time to order and we put in breakfast orders. Coffee came out luke warm. I ordered my eggs scrambled well, they were still running all over my plate. I ordered my bacon cooked easy, it came slightly burnt. During this whole experience, there were flys everywhere including on our food. It was so gross. I ordered a mimosa. Now I like a heavy pour, but even I had to order a side glass of OJ to balance the drink out. At the end of breakfast (most of which we didn't eat), we then ordered a growler. The waitress and bartender didn't know how to put it on the tab so had to ring us up two separate checks. Time to give them to card to pay for the checks and their system ain't working. The waitress said the only way to pay the bill was to write my cc # on my receipt and she would ring it later when they were back up. She says it happens often, my first thought is fix it or get a back up plan. Scary security risk?!  We left and went to a second place to have breakfast with no flys."}
{"text":"Great little spot to grab lunch or dinner. They have good size portions at a good price. Can't go wrong for a small place in the middle of no  where."}
{"text":"The breakfast is great the ambiance is awesome. Everyone is really friendly. The country music is very relaxing. You feel like you're way out in the country. The waitresses always make sure you have water and drinks. I would give 5 stars except they forgot to give me the check when we finished. After we got it we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at JD Cambell's this morning after a good hike. The coffee was outstanding. Our waitress, Molly, was amazing, engaging and attentive. The food took just a bit longer than I would have thought but was excellent! I had the green chili omelette - just an amazing burst of flavor - the black beans were also very good. Highly recommend this location to everyone!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss here. They get a 3 star because half the time the food is good, half the time it sucks, and twice it has actually been inedible. 

I've had the pork ribs. 8/10 times they have been really good. Note that the sides suck. They are bland and flavorless. The mash potatoes and gravy have NO flavor, and the macaroni and cheese doesn't either. One time we ate here the ribs were completely inedible. The manager and waiter that night were very gracious, and refunded one of the meals and gave us a free desert. (I had chewed through the ribs, which were tough and awful).

However, we went there and ordered the chicken special, which had been smoked, and it was absolutely inedible. It tasted like eating some kind of fuel. Taste the fuel not the food? I thought that slogan was supposed to be the other way around! This time the manager was not apologetic. It was a different manager, and she actually got defensive with little quips like \"Well we are really busy.\" OK.... didn't offer to comp our horrible chicken dinners. She admitted we were the only ones to order them that night. Each person in our party complained and said they were inedible. Bad customer service lady....

Their bar is equally hit-or-miss. It is really good (if a guy named Tim is bar tending), or is is absolutely abominable. Tim makes great drinks, and the other bartenders don't know what the heck they are doing and you will get some terrible version of your favorite cocktail. I ordered a very standard cocktail last time (Tom Collins), and the poor waitress looked at me like \"what's that?\".

If Tim is not bar tending, just suck it up and get a beer. It's not worth the gamble!

This place needs to learn a thing or two about constancy. I am afraid to go back because I know there is a 50/50 change I will have a good experience. For the most part, every waiter or waitress has been extremely friendly and overly nice. That is the best part about this joint. 

I can't give them a 1-star because they are an independent business, and not a chain. A rare find in suburban Peoria. But their food is all that pre-packaded production grub that comes from food service companies. It is a line kitchen... so no true chef or wizardry is occuring, its just the last stop food makes in the mega-food-production chain before your toilet. If you don't know what I am talking about, read a Michael Pollan book about where your food comes from."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere especially if you live in the neighborhood.  Fun walking up or riding your ATV to hang with friends."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed to have to give this rating for the quality of the food... but sad to say, I came down from Flagstaff to visit my 2 month niece. I love to eat here with my family. (Never have been to the bathroom) This time we came in and we had to change a baby diaper, my sister in law asked, they informed us they had no changing table in the bathroom. My sister in law then proceeded to change the baby's diaper at a bench. We then had an employee approach us and told us we can't change her there. My sister in law ask where was she supposed to change the baby's diaper. The lady told us \"out in the car\"... 100 degrees outside, small car. When we came back in for a table after changing, she approached us and said she was mistaken and there was a table to use to change her in the bathroom. It's very unfortunate the employee couldn't be more accommodating and helpful, she just rushed us outside."}
{"text":"Food was a 3 star and the service was a 2 star. The waitress messed up three of our orders and we also had to ask for the same thing multiple times. The server was very nice but didn't seem to pay much importance to what we ordered or simple requests."}
{"text":"A great find hidden away. An old gas station / diner, now bar and restaurant has that 60's ambiance that make one reminisce of past travels . And, the food is excellent. Started with corn bites. Tasted like deep fried cream corn, without a heavy oily taste. My wife said these were better than those in Kansas City ! I had the signature 'Merck burger. A bacon burger with thick cut bacon, sliced poblano peppers, cheese on a very tasty roll. With a couple of Kilt Lifters, extraordinary. My wife had the reuben on sourdough. Very nicely done. I will definitely be back to try the fish and chips and the buffalo burger. Also want to try the elk burger. Full bar, draft and bottled beer, wine, JD's has something fir everyone."}
{"text":"The location is great, the ambiance , esp. on patio, is nice ---- excellent view.  But the breakfast, from my point of view, not so good.  I ordered the quiche and couldn't eat it --- too done, and dry.  In their defense, they didn't charge me, but I wouldn't try it again.  However, the rest of the people I was with said their breakfast was okay (burritos, hash, scrambled eggs) .  So that makes me want to try again here.  Maybe lunch or dinner the next time?"}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped by for breakfast. They have a great outdoor patio when the weather is cool. Their food was excellent. I had an omelet which was wonderful. Their iced tea and coffee was fresh brewed. The waitress was friendly and the service was perfect!"}
{"text":"Super horrible service and the bartender-service staff seem to think they should completely ignore you and not present the happy hour prices if you are not a regular.
Very bad experience.  Stay away, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast with family and in-laws.  A good down home country-style breakfast.  I had the Eggs Benedict and my daughter had French Toast.   Expect a unique twist to traditional favorites.

Informal atmosphere with indoor/outdoor seating.  Plenty of TVs that become popular when the bar scene begins to arrive later in the day.

If you're looking for something a little different than the chains come here and come early to escape the crowds."}
{"text":"Service was good but food could be been better.  Ore ida style frozen potatoes were overcooked, ham was not homemade eggs were decent hard to screw eggs up though."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Ruben I have ever had! Chunks of corned beef roast homemade 1000 island dressing and top notch marble rye..... I would come to this restaurant to have the Ruben again... Came here a couple of weeks ago and has breakfast....eggs benny with house made hollandaise served on crispy potato cakes...great call!! What a
Hidden little gem....I've seen some of
The cry baby reviews and my experience was the exact opposite....as an Executive Chef I know Good food and good service...I give this place 5 stars for my two visits"}
{"text":"We have been going here for breakfast since the place opened. Today, will be the last time. The food was awful. My over medium eggs were extremely runny and partially uncooked in the middle. The potatoes are dry and taste old and reheated. Coffee was sent back. 2 stars are for the great service and the fresh toast was yummy!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. The bartender on Saturday afternoon 4/29 is horrid. I have never had worse service in my life. 
We had just left a restaurant where absolut was 6 dollars. It is 8 here. We simply asked the price and when we were surprised at the cost as this is what it would cost in the heart of Chicago the bartender told us \"well then you can go back to Chicago\" and then said \"if 8$ surprised us then we should get out more.\" I was horrified at the attitude we received. 
Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food but a very slow kitchen. Don't bother eating when there is a wait it'll take over 30 minutes to receive your food."}
{"text":"I used to love eating here but the last 2 times we've been here, the food has been horrible. Had the corned beef hash breakfast, the corned beef hash wasn't even corned beef hash, it was just chunks of beef and it was only the size of a tablespoon portion. Just had the fried chicken special and it was burned and got both white and dark meat after asking for all white meat. Plus the mashed potatoes were cold and wasn't even served any gravy with it. I won't be going back. Twice burned."}
{"text":"Always a great burger friendly service sometimes it gets a little bit busy but they always seem to manage it very well"}
{"text":"I wanted to try some place new on Mother's Day, so hubby and I loaded up our son and went knowing that hey every place we went would be busy. Reservations were not a requirement so we expected to wait a while. To our surprise we were never seated because people had called in to make reservations and nothing was available until 1 pm. Again having a reservation was not a requirement. Serves me right from steering away from my usual breakfast place. Sadly we will never go back to this place, based on this experience alone."}
{"text":"CHICKEN. POT. PIE. To die for!!! Where do I start without drooling... This was a restaurant I had saved in my bookmarks for quite some time and in an attempt to do something different for once, came in here for dinner Sunday. 

It is such a cute little restaurant and it makes you feel all warm and cozy the second you walk in. Being from Wisconsin, I enjoy a restaurant with a darker ambiance and this did it for me. I had a glass of wine, chili, salad and the amazing pot pie. The chili was good and hearty with just enough kick and the side salad was you know, a salad. Ranch was delicious which I always appreciate. The pot pie came out piping hot and the first bite made my mouth water. It was so much better than anticipated. Just enough creamy with large chunks of tender chicken throughout. And the flaky crust...wow! My husband ordered a club sandwich because he wanted something a little \"lighter\" and he was really jealous of my entree choice. 

I will definitely be back. Even it's just to take a seat at the bar, enjoy the cozy atmosphere and country music. It's hard to find a good watering hole around this area that isn't so commercialized and I am glad I finally decided to swing in!!"}
{"text":"Just not good

Overpriced juice prices and not good food


Also very strange to be under a real estate office


The service was very sub par


Maybe they should get rid if the gas
Station sign and covers"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday at 11am. Tjey were serving only breakfast. No lunch offered. I ordered biscuits and gravy, eggs and bacon. I asked for crispy bacon and it was burnt. The biscuits tasted canned and the potatoes were overcooked. I didn't send it back but should have and pretty much just ate my egg whites. This is the second time I've had food there get messed up. 
Ordered Bloody Marys with extra olives. The extra olives were delivered when our drinks were almost gone. 
I like the look of the place with its country theme. The service was pretty good. I'm just not willing to go back for burnt food or messed up orders."}
{"text":"Went here this morning with my wife --- at first we were skeptical because it wasn't very appealing when we walked in (still looked like the Campbell's market inside...minor remodel). But after meeting the friendly staff and served promptly, our experience started turning around. My wife ordered the frosted flakes encrusted French toast (AMAZING!!!). I ordered the burrito with chicken fried steak, eggs, cheese, potatoes, & smothered with gravy. It was delicious ... Definitely will return back and refer to friends and family."}
{"text":"Recently moved here and found the place by accident. Great atmosphere, great food (especially the creative breakfast menu). Ya'll gotta try the ding-dong cake. Service is a little slow when the place gets packed, but overall worth the wait."}
{"text":"Second time we were here for breakfast. Disappointed this time in service and food. Molly seemed to be overwhelmed and forgot to bring g me syrup for my pancake. The pancake tasted like it was frozen and reheated. I didn't need syrup as it wasn't edible. Molly was too busy and another server was needed. She threw our bloody Mary down along with the bill. They need better help in the mornings."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go there when I visit my parents in Peoria. Can't beat the great happy hour prices. The people there are always friendly and the beer is always cold. :)"}
{"text":"F-ing French toast. Love it! So many friendly faces in the staff. You can sit at the bar for a lil sass with your football. I kid she is an eagles fan. Always nice to sleep in and get breakfast after 11!"}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie:  Meh.  Huge I give them that, but it is bland and you can hardly cut the breading on top.  I'd never order it again myself.
A friend got the oddest Cobb salad I've ever seen made with black beans.  However, he seemed to enjoy it.  Just don't expect it to be made with items that normally are seen on this specialty salad.
However, the other food looked good--and every portion seems pretty huge.  I'll give it another shot sometime down the road for sure.
Service was good from the entire young staff of kids.
If you are so inclined, you can sit on their little porch where a number of tables for 4 are set-up.  That could be fun some cool morning or evening sans bugs to do.

Update:  Went back with a group of friends, and had their Reuben sandwich which is pretty darn good!  Would definitely go back for that.  
The downfall here is the service from what we experienced this visit.  I had iced tea, and no sugar.  Had to ask another waitress to bring some.  The gal drifted off to get the order from a group of 3 when we had 14 people waiting for a good half hour or more.
Still and all, we could sit outside, and we all loved that since the weather was great.
I like this place overall, and will go back again.  I am even upping them to 4 stars now!!!"}
{"text":"Tried JD Campbell's last weekend for brunch. I ordered the green chili omelette. It was just okay, it was pretty bland for green chili. 

The other people in my group agreed it was average as far as breakfast goes. 

The waitstaff was helpful, despite having their system down for checks/receipts."}
{"text":"I enjoy the breakfast waaaaay more than the dinner.  I ordered for dinner the corned beef sandwich with mac & cheese.... would of love more meat... but it was tasty.  The mac and cheese was probably one of the worst... it tasted like the rue mixture (flour)... needs fresh cheese badly!"}
{"text":"Stopped here this morning for brunch. No wait, but had a decent amount of customers. My daughter ordered the kids breakfast quesadilla, and I ordered a waffle, with eggs and bacon between waffle halves, and gravy on top. Both meals came with a side of fried potatoes. The food was yummy, came out quickly, and the service was great. The restaurant ambiance makes you feel like you're away in some small town family cafe. Will definitely go back and try dinner."}
{"text":"This place is really close to our house, so we have eaten here quite a few times. It's always packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a while. The music is always great, but always way too loud. I don't want to yell across the table when I am trying to hold a conversation. The food is hit or miss. Sometimes it is super good, sometimes it's super bad. I have had the frittata special a few times and it is always good. We have had dinner here and it wasn't wonderful. The calamari appetizer was greasy and didn't taste good, the brisket my husband ordered was very dry on the inside, but super greasy on the outside. Go for breakfast and you will love it."}
{"text":"Second visit to Campbell, this time for breakfast...all I can say is delicious! I had their blueberry pancakes with bacon...the pancakes were large and fluffy and loaded with berries, so good they didn't need any syrup...if you find yourself on 91st and Pinnacle peak on a Saturday or Sunday be sure to stop by...you will enjoy the casual atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about the French toast but missed the breakfast cutoff. Had half rack and Ny strip. The ribs were dry and the ny strip was served with bbq sauce for some reason. Not the best place to eat but since the steak was perfectly cooked lets call my sub par experience a blip rather than the standard. I'm going to try that French toast if it kills me."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was great, the portion size was excellent for the price and the waiting staff was exactly what I was looking for.

Will I be back? You're damn right I will be. I am happy to have found my new breakfast place."}
{"text":"The merc burger is fabulous!! I wouldn't go here for a fine dining experience... BUT they make a really good burger, and the drinks are reasonably priced. I paid about $6 for a bloody Maria. And it was super yummy. I also love that I could have more bloody Marias because this place is literally across the street from my house. I just have to look both ways"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for years, have always wanted to stop in. Had the chance to today and we are so happy we did! It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice, and it's hard to say if we will go back. Both times it was on a Sunday and both times it was for lunch. The first time we ate in the dining room and food was really good. We had a pulled pork sandwich and the nachos (they use potato slices instead of chips, different). The service was great. 
The second time we went we decided to sit in the bar and this turned into a two hour lunch. I realize the bartender (who was an excellent server once she got to us) is both the bartender and server, but it took at least 10 minutes for her to come by. She was talking to a table next to us for the first 5 minutes and never acknowledged us. Once the drinks were ordered they came pretty quick, but we are probably talking 15 minutes before that all happened. We ordered a burger (medium) and the sliders. When the burger came out it was so well done it was actually burnt on one side. Now I hate returning food, in fact I have a huge anxiety thinking about what the cooks do to your re-cooked food, but the server insisted and took my food away. In literally three minutes, she brought back a new burger without the fries (because they were still cooking). Let's think about that. The burger came out in 3 minutes, but the fries weren't done. So as you can imaging I basically got a rare burger. Now I'm going out of my mind because I have to return this second burger, but yea the fries finally arrived and yes as well done as the first burger. I didn't want anything else, but the manager came over and insisted I try something else, so I ordered the sliders, ate one, drank another beer, and left. The server/bartender was again awesome and very apologetic and she gave us a $5 off card for our next visit. 
I'm torn because I really like the atmosphere, the service is great, but the food now terrifies me. Plus, as I looked at the other reviews here a lot of people are saying the same thing. Maybe the are going through growing pains and are working out the kinks. I'll just have to keep an eye on Yelp and see where it goes."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to the restaurant. Th e portion size is very large. Great brisket and my fiancée loved the pulled pork. Ended our meal with the homemade Carrot cake which was to die for. Service was great."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE This place! 1st time there but definitely will not be the last! Tried it for dinner...looking forward to trying out breakfast and the live music on Saturday! btw service was amazing!"}
{"text":"After several visits now, I'd honestly say I like this establishment, but I am leery about the true food quality- as in the sourcing.  Don't get me wrong, it does taste fine, but any food can taste fine and still be of poor quality.  In short, I would prefer a restaurant be proud to mention where they source their food from, especially their meat.

I labored too much over giving the 4th star here.  Partly, because I am hopeful, but also because the service has been pretty good but not exceptional.  Had to help myself to some table items when the place was new, but I won't let that cloud otherwise pretty good table-side manners.  I still suspect rather ordinary food (canned/frozen) but since I can't see it...

Took out of town family in for burgers on one visit- one commented on it being the best burger he'd tasted in a long time and wanted to ship one back home to enjoy once he got back!

Inside, I love the feel.  the large dining room flows nicely from a family area, to casual dining, to pub-side, and then even a spot or two that are more intimate.  It seems strange, but it works.  A corner bar completes the happening hodge-podge.

As an area \"native\", I couldn't bear the thought of the old Campbell Mercantile building not being a part of the landscape.  For that, I hope this place enjoys a long, successful run.

But seriously...let's work on the food sourcing..."}
{"text":"Stopped by Friday for breakfast.. Love this place great people here! great beers with growler fills and a great to go selection.  Thanks for making us feel right at home."}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood joint! Great service, decent food! We had a blast on the patio with our kids as well! Fun environment!"}
{"text":"Not too happy about this location anymore. Service was not good and food was even worse.  My wings were not good and when I told them about it,  they refried the same wings. Who would do that?"}
{"text":"We love this place! Just moved close by and have passed it so many times over the years on our way to Liberty High but never stopped in.  This is now our weekly place! The food is amazing, service excellent!"}
{"text":"Good if you like greasy bar food. Staff is not friendly at all. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"They've done a good job since reopening as JD's but wish they had the Gardenburger and fries Campbell's had. But other than that, good and friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast by a local owner!! The French toast is amazing! Portions are huge so go hungry!!"}
{"text":"Great country time place, everyone is smiling. Prob because the food is great and the cozy country atmosphere brings the cowboys home. You can take a city girl here and she will instantly feel like a cowgirl. This pace has it all for comfort foods and great breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with delicious spins on country breakfast items. I had the Ranchhands Benedict and it was incredible. the corn beef hash was amazing and I will use this as a basis for good cornbeef hash for now on. it was served on cornbread, which was fantastic. The chicken fried steak was tender and perfectly crispy. Will definitely come back again for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place in the past but today irritated me!! We ordered the chicken fried steak burrito which comes with chunks of chicken fried steak, chunks of potatoes and cheese smothered in sausage gravy. WELL today the potatoes stuffed into our burrito were OLD and COLD!! Unacceptable!!!! No, putting old and cold potatoes, just because they are stuffed into a burrito does not make them fresh and hot!!! 

I'm being nice by giving them 2 stars because of the fact that when the burrito is done right, it is quite tasty! SHAME on the COOK for serving us OLD and COLD potatoes in our burrito!!!"}
{"text":"The greeting at the front door is extremely warm and welcoming. The service is excellent. The onion rings are delicious and so are the French fries. The rest of the food was mediocre at best. My husband had the Buffalo burger and I had the hot wings. The wings were mushy and not hot at all. Burger was odd tasting too. My friend had Philly cheese steak, flavorless, his wife had a nondescript sandwich. Merlot tasted like watered down wine. Nothing impressive here."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere.  A really fun place to come and eat and visit with friends and neighbors.  Really a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"My 2 stars are for the convenience of location... And cold beer... The menu needs a serious revision considering their location... They have potential to really become a \"hot spot\". I can't stand the other place nearby which is more like a bottom shelf with top shelf prices! The food really doesn't hit my palette but again... i do enjoy the"}
{"text":"Nice to have a local joint like LW's. Burgers are very good. Salad was fresh mixed greens (not iceburg lettuce). Flourless chocolate cake is delicious."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, until the manager ruined it... TERRIBLE food, EVEN WORSE service, and a manager that acts like you insulted her personally (and TAKES it personally) if you complain... After you've waited 20minutes for the mayo that they forgot on your sandwich... AFTER YOUVE ASKED 3 times lol... Just don't TELL them you've had bad service."}
{"text":"We have been here two times now.  The food was great and the service right on....It is so nice to have a nice place to go right in the neighborhood.  We have had the pasta, ribs, pulled pork and a chicken sandwich...They were all good.  Large portions so ended up taking some home.

Both times our waiter knew the menu, and told us about the specials....  Spot on.....

I love the decor...you feel so comfy and right at home...The place is spotless.

The first time we were there we had a flat tire when we went to our car.  The owner was wonderful...After a long long wait for AAA she offered to take us home.  Finally two of the guys on her staff changed it for us...Above and beyond the scope of their duties."}
{"text":"Great burgers! This is a fantastic little neighborhood spot, and the prices are fair for what you get. Elk & buffalo satisfy our more adventurous palates and the fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was pretty concerned about going here because the reviews I saw mentioned quite a few negative things about the place. Our visit on Sunday was definitely was a positive one! 
They wasted no time seating us, despite it looking pretty busy. 
The waitress that worked with us was polite and swift!
The food came out faster than expected!
The food was very tasty and arrived with no issues!
Breakfast was well priced for the amount!

My only regret is that I didn't take a picture of the current menu! Some of those desert items looked amazing! We would definitely go again! A+"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times now. Great place. Food is always good. The deserts are to die for. You can't go wrong with any of them. The ding ding cake is unbelievable. All the deserts are home made. Be sure to read the backs of all the t-shirts the staff wears."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast on the weekend. They have some outside seating and the inside has some old west decor.   The food was awesome.  My son had a blueberry waffle and he was amazed at how good it was.  As he is use to eating ihop waffles.  I tried it and agreed it was awesome. I got the breakfast sandwich and that was good too. We got plenty of food and the prices were reasonable.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local restaurant.
If you know the area at all... This location use to be a gas station (the last one to stop at before heading out to the lake). I love how the restaurant kept the Campbell's name & the history decor inside.
Now, the food... The menu is pretty much the same you would see at any American style restaurant (burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.); however, there is something about the twist on flavors & ingredients that gives this american restaurant something a bit special.
My favorite time to come is the breakfast menu served Friday-Sunday. The eggs Benedict served on-top of potato cakes is scrumptious.
If you are in a hurry & looking for a deal on food, not the place for you.
This is a layed-back cowboy restaurant with high quality menu items thus a bit more $$ will be spent.
On another note... It's also a fun place to come hang out with friends or date night with hubby during happy hour. The place takes on a whole new vibe. Enjoy! Giddy-up!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I won't come back. Clam chowder didn't taste like clam chowder. Chicken fried steak tasted like the cook dropped the whole jar of fennel in the pot of gravy."}
{"text":"It's ok here, I really enjoy breakfast more than the dinner here. That's usually when it seems busiest also. It's nice that it's right down the road from us but it's not a favorite place. It's just ok. But I do love their gravy and their breakfast, so if you want to try them out that's when I would suggest going. Yum"}
{"text":"Our favorite local joint. Amongst all the chain restaurants that are in this area it is great to have a local bar and grill with surprisingly awesome food! Great service to go along with it. Make sure to try the Pig Wings!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice local restaurant! My husband and I went here for the first time for dinner. Happy hour is from 3 to 7, very generous! They had a good selection of beer and other drinks and wines. We sat outside on the patio out front. It was very pleasant. The food was very good, I have to say I was surprised! My husband had the ribeye and I had the ribs. Both were delicious. We had the Sweet Corn Nuggets for an appetizer - yummy! 

I didn't give it 5 stars because the service was a little slow. But, the food and drinks were worth the wait. They had other servers coming around and asking if we needed anything. The owner came by with a desert tray and tried to tempt us, but we were stuffed! A new favorite place, will definitely come back, and soon too.

Can't wait to try the breakfasts on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"I love having JD's in my neighborhood - it's a cowboy diner where everything has a bit of a Western flair.  They have a 12-14 seat bar, a nice porch area outside facing the south (sun in winter, shade in summer!), and tables for 4-6 inside.  I've been here on dates for dinner, done family breakfast with 16 people, brought friends for lunch, walked over for drinks at night, and I've been happy each time.  Here's a Top 5:

1. Anything Breakfast - only a limited breakfast menu from 11-1 on M-Th, but Fri-Sun they're open early with a full breakfast menu - some personal faves: Tumbleweed Burrito (country gravy covered breakfast burrito), Ranch Hand Benedict (hash brown cakes instead of English muffins), cereal coated french toast, and corned beef hash.
2. Sweet Corn Nuggets - deep fried sweet corn batter with a spicy dipping sauce
3. Lunch salads - taco salad, fruity salad, greek salad, liked them all
4. Pork Green Chili - I've never liked this particular thing, until JD's
5. 'Merc' Burger with guac, bacon, and chili peppers, plus their fries are really crispy and delicious"}
{"text":"Slower service on Sunday's. I think the chickens are still laying the eggs for our breakfast. Been waiting so long ice all melted in our drink. Good food - just a loong wait."}
{"text":"I have several favorite breakfast restaurants i go to often. Every once in a while you just want to go somewhere else. Opened up Yelp this morning and started looking. LW's was a drive but looked interesting. My wife likes cinnamon french toast and they had a different take on french toast. 
Surprise, surprise, when we got there I saw a very familiar building. Campbell's, I had stopped here many times years ago on my way to the lake and my children had spent hours here as this was the only place open late. Now it is LW's. Waitress said it changed names about 1 and a half years ago.
Basically a square two story building with the restaurant in the bottom. There is plenty of seating inside and outside, weather permitting and this time of year it would be a nice place to eat. Nothing fancy, wood floors, I believe it would call the decor rustic. (thats what my wife said)
My wife liked the french toast and I also had a piece. It was good. I had my standard, 2 eggs over easy. I was surprised when they actually came to me over easy. Most places serve them over medium or over well. I enjoyed my eggs. The hash browns had a new flavor to them I could not identify. They were excellent. Only down for the meal was they forgot to bring my toast. I really did not need it but I did expect it to come with the meal. Instead when I mentioned it, it was delivered immediately. Meaning it was the piece I ordered but was now hard and cold. 
Even with that I gave them 4 stars as everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
As for returning I will but it will be because I am in the area. Just to far to travel for breakfast. Go see them I think you will enjoy."}
