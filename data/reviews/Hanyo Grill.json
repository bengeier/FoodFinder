{"text":"Went here several times during stays at Sheraton Wild Horse Pass; it is also the source of poolside food and bar service. Casual patio dining complete with umbrella covered tables which are scattered around the center bar and overlooking pool; birds will join you at the table, it happens. 

Typical fare: burgers, sammies, chicken, salads, and bar bites=AOk; drinks were good and refreshing on hot days; servers were friendly and efficient. Perhaps I'm easily amused, but the 'flag system' (a flag at your poolside lounge chair which you raise for service) was ingenious to me, especially considering how many times I've languished at Las Vegas pools waiting for Holly, Bridget or Kendra to even TAKE an order! 

I digress, we enjoyed our food, beverages, and service at Hanyo and will absolutely be back for pool season again. 3.5*"}
{"text":"The brisket and Barbacoa are good.  Menu is burgers, salads and quesadillas.  Atmosphere a bit like a cafeteria but the outdoor seating is nice. Been there twice and the service is incredibly slow."}
{"text":"This is a great outside poolside place for delightful and imaginative drinks. Located at the Wild Horse Pass Resort and Spa in Chandler, AZ. Also provides  a variety of food items to satisfy your hunger. 

Fantastic view of the surrounding mountains with large pool area for adults and children. 

Pool chairs have a flag system that you can raise for service. So no matter where you sit you never have to leave your seat for food or drink. The separate eating area is covered and the birds that beg for food are not afraid of humans. 

After a long flight this is the place to sit back, enjoy the scenery, and take in a drink or three. 

Staff is the best. Only draw back for me is like the places in Miami the gratuity is added to your check. It is a shame that businesses feel this has to be done for their workers because some \"people\" leave little or no tip for the servers. If you don't wish to tip there is always the fast food drive thru. 

We enjoyed the drinks, food, and especially the staff we are hosting a family get together here this weekend."}
