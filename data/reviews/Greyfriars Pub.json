{"text":"Love the risoto balls and black bean patties!! The staff is friendly and location quiet pub style"}
{"text":"Not the best experience eating here.  Atmosphere and beer are A1...but the food is ordinary at best.  In particular as huge curry lover.. I expected a pub to have a 'decent' curry.. but I asked the waitress if it was any good.  She enthusiastically responded that it was fantastic!  I said great and couldnt wait to get my hands on it.  When it appeared it was not even a curry..more like a pasta type of dish.  I ate some of it and then decided to ask her about it, she then said that well yes she prefers her curry elsewhere but as a waitress/salesperson she was doing the right thing by promoting it to me.  I didnt finish the meal and she made no offer to provide another dish or credit for it.  I got the managers name, paid and left.  When I contacted the manager he was extremely professional open to the feedback.  He acknowledged that the situation should have been handled differently and he mailed us $75 in gift certificates.    We did try it again.. avoiding the curry of course.. and had an average meal.    Still some work to be done here to increase quality of food and service but I give cudo's to the manager for handling the complaint so well.  Also.. they host free Poker, Wed or Thurs so they have that going for them!"}
{"text":"I'm a local, here's my take: Pros: - cheap booze - good booze selection - friendly staff - family friendly - central locale if you want to eat elsewhere - shows UFC!  Cons: - mediocre food - I frequent this pub ;)  Great overall value. Cheers feel and great staging pub or finale destination."}
{"text":"Most of the Oakville bars I went to in high school (sorry Mom) and undergrad are merely memories today, having gone out of business or changed hands several times. When I met a bunch of high school friends here for drinks, I wasn't sure what to expect out of a stripmall pub 'near Walmart'.  But it's really cute inside. It has an authentic pub 'everybody knows your name' kind of feel. I guess it didn't hurt that I ran in to my brother...  But anyway, cheap $4 pints and mixed drinks were a welcome change from the Toronto scene.   The food was only okay and the menu was a bit comical. No bells and whistles, printed on a white piece of paper (not laminated). The best part was that \"wings\" and \"nacho\" (singular) and \"fingers\" appear on the menu with no other description or information whatsoever. Even the waitress had to laugh at it - luckily she was able to fill us in on some descriptions.   I went for the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was tasty, but was served on a regular ol' hamburger bun. The fries that came with it could have used some salt or something. Nothing to rave about really.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend for drinks with old friends, but next time I'll probably eat elsewhere."}
