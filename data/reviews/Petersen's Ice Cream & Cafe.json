{"text":"Fresh waffle cone and REAL ice cream,  non of the fro yo crap. What more could this girl want?   Amazing!  Located in booming downtown Gilbert with some great restaurants.   Service is good, they hired some pretty smart kids behind the counter they are respectful and friendly. Made sure my family and I were taken care of. Ask for samples!!    Lines maybe be a little intimidating but move pretty fast and the atmosphere is great.    Hands down best ice cream in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this little cute ice cream parlor out while dining in old town Gilbert and needless to say we won't be back. The aroma you get when walking into this creamery is amazing; but unfortunately there were several bugs (fruit flies) everywhere on the glass of the freezers with the ice cream. We figured ok maybe their just outside of the freezers but the ice cream will be fine.. Ha wishful thinking on our part:( while eating my ice cream I found a dead fruit fly.. Despite finding the bug the ice cream (YUCK) there was nothing special about it.. Unhappy & won't be returning.."}
{"text":"I asked employee for a receipt and she said it did not asked for that option. So she wrote the amount paid on a piece of paper. After a few hours I received an email of the purchase with a tip amount added which I did not include because that option was not available.  I feel scammed into not receiving my receipt in order for the staff to enter there own tip amount. I really liked this place but may not return due to this type of employee behavior. This business needs to check on their employees who may be taking advantage of other ppl's hard earned money. :("}
{"text":"4/22---21:47   Wade recommended Moose Tracks and it was the bomb. They were crazy busy, and he took the time to hook a brotha up. Katie rung me up, and asked me about my weekend. They both made for a great experience. The third employee was visibly busy, and doing her job. Killer stuff guys"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday night around 10pm. My husband and I both ordered brownie sundaes as 2 of our original choices were already sold out. That was fine, as I knew it was late. The brownie sundae was great!   Service was super slow as it was being run by 3 teenage girls. It was annoying to see their friends who came in after us being served before us, and not charged. Ice cream great but service is lacking."}
{"text":"Decided to come have some ice cream since it was national ice cream day. Came and waited in the long line for a banana split. The banana split was ok nothing exciting and average price for a banana split. The servers are young and relatively friendly.  In terms of cleanliness the score is low. I've been here for about twenty five minutes from waiting to order to consuming the food and I have not seen them wash their hands once.  They go from serving the ice cream, grabbing ingredients for the sundaes and taking payment. Gloves will come out randomly but not enough. They get TR jw ingredients in them and maneuver the cookies/doughnuts/brownies with their hands while trying to serve the ice cream on them.  To be fair the girl working seems to be more aware of the cleanliness and tries a bit more.  Overall I'd rather go to a national chain. Which is a shame because I like supporting small business.  Came Sunday Afternoon around 5-5:30"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little ice cream shop! I just had a scoop of butter pecan. The ice cream was delicious but my favorite part was the waffle cone - they actually make them in the store. You can watch them do it.  Can't wait to try more. They make shakes and malts too from all their flavors of ice cream. We definitely will keep this place in mind when we want a sweet treat."}
{"text":"The ice cream is fabulous and the fresh waffle cones are delicious! Haven't tried their other dessert creations but I appreciate they have a variety of offerings."}
{"text":"this place is great the ice cream is great idk who Peterson is but he is omnipotent and there's a special place in heaven for him next to Michael Jackson and my guncle who overdosed on cocaine last year (may he rest in peace)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Have to say this is a very sugary place for ice cream haha, but is SO good. Everything is good. Usually only get a scoop of ice cream, but have tasted most of everything. Worth the wait on weekends. Moderately friendly staff. Not many chairs/tables to sit. But great taste!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I was thoroughly impressed. The service was great and both the ice cream and sorbet were amazing. I highly recommend the cappuccino and Mackinaw Island fudge ice cream flavors.  The lemon and raspberry sorbet were great as well.  I am thrilled to have a nice dessert spot in downtown Gilbert and I wish Petersen's all the best."}
{"text":"The ice cream was hit or miss. Customer service was friendly but we did see every employee touch their face, hair, nose, etc with their bare hands and then touch waffle cones with their bare hands. We even told them what they were doing and they still didn't wash their hands before serving the next several guests. We will probably be back. Until then, please wash your hands."}
{"text":"Sunday, January 31st around 3:45. I would have rated this a 5 but it's a 3 unfortunately.   Being my first time into Peterson's, I was really excited to take my girls. The gentleman that greeted us, Victor, was kind and extremely patient. My oldest cannot have dyes. I asked Victor if he knew what ice cream had dyes in it. He said he didn't know so he turned around and asked his coworker. She rudely and impatiently scoffed, \"I don't know. The white one.\" (I would like to point out that even some white ice creams have dyes too.) She turned around to proceed being on the phone, drinking her drink, flirting with another coworker, and doing side work the entire time while several other people came in after. I was immensely disappointed by her poor manners and rudeness. He, without hesitation, looked at the ice cream for us. Throughout it all I was grateful Victor was taking care of us because had it been his coworker, I would never return. I would've tipped had they not shared tips."}
{"text":"This place is good if you like hand scooped ice cream.  Unfortunately, it's not my favorite.  It's a little on the expensive side so either share or plan to order small.  The shop is really cute and the staff is really nice.  It wasn't what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Although the staff was friendly and greeted us this place is a nasty dirty. Doubt it's been properly cleaned since it opened. Many ice creams in the case had other flavors mixed in from being dropped in or not cleaned scoops. Not to mention the have Awesome brand spray cleaners sitting on there counters where food prep is happening. They also sprayed the ice cream case with the cleaner yes lid down however not cool with ice. Team in the case. Dust is thick all over this place even back where the food prep is. Waffle cone batter has stuff floating in it."}
{"text":"What an amazing ice cream shop! Everything is amazing, including the cookies! They have so many flavors and are always introducing new flavors and updating the existing flavors."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite ice cream spot. Everyone working their is incredibly friendly and passionate about customer service. They all know the history of Peterson's which tells me it's a good company that cares about their employees. The homemade waffle cones which are made right in front of you are delicious. The ice cream is just incredible. If you go during the day you won't wait. After dinner in a Friday or Saturday night you'll be waiting in line but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is Nathan aka Pink Floyd. He is the best ice cream salesman I have ever met.   Not only is he super friendly, his standard of customer service is off the charts. He knows his product and how to market it like a pro. I know this review should be about the ice cream , which was very good, but sometimes the personal experience is the layer of flavor that makes something good truly great!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. The decor is cute, the kids who work there are \"meh\" about their jobs and the prices are outrageous...all of which would be fine if the ice cream were good. But...plot twist! It isn't! I'd rather have blue bunny and my fifty dollars back.  Just proof that you could literally sell poo on a stick in downtown Gilbert and get a line out the door."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is just adorable for starts- great curb appeal and such a great addition to this Gilbert area! Fun retro, old soda shop vibe. Today was my second visit to Petersens in just the past couple weeks. I'd never had their ice cream before and found it to be extremely light and fluffy. They offer some food selections and of course a tasty variety of dessert options. When you first walk in you're hit with the most amazing waffle cone smell- you can't turn away once you're inside- it smells too delicious!   Oh by the way- our waffle cones were made to order! Where else are you going to get that?!   Our ice cream shop attendant today was Logan. He was bubbly, service oriented, fun, welcoming, and just delivered the best experience for myself and my parents who were first timers! Service was so outstanding I had to come straight home to write this review. It's places like this that need community support and they have mine!   I would definitely recommend visiting Petersens for a fun trip out for dessert! Trust me- you will find room after dinner if you take one wiff of the intoxicating smell inside!"}
{"text":"Petersen's Ice Cream shop is a blast from the past. It's an old school mom and pop ice cream parlor with interior design/decorations that bring you back to an era that matches the oldies music being played.   They've got large selection of ice cream with some unique flavors--so you're bound to find one you love. I got their brownie sundae with NY vanilla ice cream, topped with hot fudge. It was served perfectly--warm, gooey center, and it didn't get soggy.   Had some good great customer service here too. Workers were helpful in explaining what the flavors would go well with and were extremely friendly. When we sat down and were eating, we realized we forgot to ask for some water, and a worker came up to ask if she could grab us some water! Perfect timing on her part.   Love this little ice cream shop. Perfect place to take the family or to end date night."}
{"text":"Cute little ice cream shop in the middle of a ton of great restaurants in downtown Gilbert. Perfect place to stop on a hot day after grabbing dinner or just because. My daughter loved her mint chocolate chip ice cream & my cookie dough was good. It wasn't the best I've had but it was good! There is a lot to choose from & many tempting options (brownie sundae!). Friendly customer service, indoor and outdoor seating and many different flavors to choose from...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just wanted a nice strawberry ice cream cup but I guess you can't find something like that in Arizona. When I checked their website everything looked great and it was in glass dishes but when I went there everything was served in a plastic cup and the girl looked like she really didn't want to work that day. The ice cream wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this ice cream spot because it's old fashioned ice cream rather then these fancy frozen yogurt places that are just not real ice cream. The place looks very inviting from Gilbert rd. We came here on a Friday evening around 730 pm and although the ice-cream was good the store was very poorly taken care of. I first noticed the menus to look at rather then looking up at the board, they were dirty/sticky, who knows how long it's been since they were wiped down I put that right back and preferred to look up at the board. The display cases look very tacky with paper written flavors and taped to the display, the freezer closest to the main door had a broken hinge so when they opened and closed the lid it was very noticeable that it's broken. The employees were not that friendly. No welcome in, or would you like to sample some flavors. When we sat down at the table I was looking at the wall and noticed alot of dried ice cream among other spilled ingredients splattered on the wall,  the chair rail (molding) on the wall had dust and dirt on it, the base boards were gross if the dining area is this dirty it makes you wonder what the back of the store looks like. The display case had nothing in it, I'm assuming cakes and ice-cream to go are suppose to be in there. The amount of dust on the awning above the to go fridge needs to be cleaned. Considering this area downtown is fairly new/ up and coming newer attraction area you would think the store wouldn't look like its been open for 5+ years. The store needs some serious TLC. Hopefully this will be addressed and noticeable if we decide to return ."}
{"text":"Very good ice cream shop!! Lots of flavors to choose from and a variety of options to spice it up (e.g. Shakes, sundaes, malts, etc).  Good to have a quality ice cream shop in an area dominated by frozen yogurt.    Mint chip is delicious.  We will definitely be back,"}
{"text":"Favorite stop after eating at one of the restaurants nearby. Love the Affogato myself."}
{"text":"There is an old ice cream parlor shop feel and has fun atmosphere. Service was good and they were kind and helpful in giving samples. There were many different flavors, shakes, and menu items.  I got the NY cherry ice cream which was good, more vanilla than cherry, not too sweet but was like any other place. I also got the waffle cone; I wish it was a little thicker (also its an additional $1 not $0.95 like it says on the menu). I would stick with the sugar cone.  Next time I would probably try their shakes or sundaes. These items may be the things that sets them apart from other places."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place after hearing and reading reviews. We went in and the place is adorable no doubt and the smell of fresh waffle cones mouthwatering. However, the ice cream itself was nothing special and a bit overpriced in my opinion. I wish I could give it a better review but, we left a little unsatisfied. :/"}
{"text":"While visiting family in Gilbert, we walked to downtown Gilbert to get some ice cream.  It's a cute place playing 50's music.  The kids were nice.  They were out of Pralines and cream which is what half the group wanted to try.  They had about 20ish flavors to choose from.  This is a solid ice cream shop."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. .... large portions which are unheard of!!!   They guys are super nice too!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute ice-cream shop in downtown Gilbert ... much needed! We've stopped by a couple of times after dining at one of the nearby restaurants to have some yummy treats from Petersen's Ice Cream & Cafe. The interior is really bright even with the pastel mint, pink, & white walls; it makes me feel like I'm in an old fashioned ice-cream parlor from another era! Their friendly staff always seems to be willing to help out so we've had very pleasant experiences every time. They offer multiple different ice-cream flavors which are honestly pretty standard, however the taste is spot on!  We typically get a scoop of ice-cream each, but the last time we went in, my fiancé did the ordering. We ended up with a 1-scoop brownie sundae! They let us pick our ice-cream flavor so we went with the Mackinac Island Fudge. It was a super chocolatey treat, large enough for two to share.  I glanced over the menu and saw that they offer multiple shakes, malts, floats, coffee drinks, and even cookie & donut ice-cream sandwiches! Overall, this place is worth a stop-in if you're in the area, looking for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"This place is great! Flavors aren't super creative or out of the ordinary but they're quality. I've been here twice with the SO and have tried their donut ice cream sandwich (really good but would only have once, way too sweet), their affogato (no complaints!) and have had their waffle cones with a couple scoops of some of their flavors. The boyfriend being a vanilla man loves that they have more than one type of vanilla. I wasn't wow'ed with the mint chocolate chip but I was happy. And their service is always happy and fast and friendly! Really no reason not to go here."}
{"text":"We felt like dessert from a unique place in Phoenix since we were visiting. I yelped and found this place and are happy we went. It's in a cool hip area. I had a banana split with three  scoops of butter pecan, cinnamon and turtle ice cream. Sat inside though, as it's real cold at the moment!"}
{"text":"This place has some old school charm going on with it. There is a large selection ice-cream and they have a whole board of ways they can make that ice cream into straight diabetes for you. Want to make your own ice cream sandwich? On a hot cookie? With 18 other ice-cream scoops? With sprinkles? Hot fudge? On a brownie? Smothered in fruit? Caramel? Fudge to go? Ice-cream to go? Want them to hand-roll a cone in front of you?   Then go here."}
{"text":"Cute little shop but it was pretty cramped with just my friend, me, and 2 little families inside. Sunday afternoon it was pretty darn busy and only 1 employee was working. I know that feeling and it sucks, it would be different if everyone only wanted 1 scoop cones/cups but my friend wanted a banana split and the lady behind us was talking about shakes. For one person that's a lot of work. At least it was nice and cool inside. The ice cream was yummy too and the girl helping us was really nice."}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream place in the area love the old fashioned feel custom sundaes are delish ice cream floats are nice as well I go whenever I am in the area"}
{"text":"I went back yesterday (Saturday night) and gave them another shot as I was craving a hot fudge sundae.  The traffic was busy but the store clean, the ice cream servers were quick to recognize folks coming in while they multi tasked. My order was taken quickly and was no need for a ticket.  I got a hot fudge sundae in a glass as I was eating there, with the works!, and it was great!! Could have been a fluke so we went back again tonight for another sweet tooth craving and found the same atmosphere with the employees once again pleasing and a clean store. So based on two follow up visits I will raise the level to five stars."}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced. The stamp card is 1 stamp per visit not per purchase. The flavors weren't that great, customer service was average. Waffle cone didn't have anything at the bottom to stop your ice cream from dripping all over you. Try investing in some marshmallows. Won't be going back there. Better choices, such as Frost(gelato) or Sub Zero!"}
{"text":"Our family's new favorite ice cream place! Sampled a ton of flavors, New York Vanilla and Cinnamon were big hits! The employees were friendly and didn't seem to mind that the kids needed a few extra samples before they made their final choice. Loved the old time music and cute decor too!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sundae and got a cup with ice cream and topping. When we ask the young guy did we ordered wrong because on the menu it has bananas he said the menu is out dated... really then what menu should we go off of ????"}
{"text":"Cutest little ice cream place in Gilbert! Make sure to stop by after getting dinner! I always end up getting a sundae, but all of the flavors I've had are great! Can't go wrong with anything. I'm still dying to try their signature root beer float."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place in Gilbert, but so disappointed now. The ice cream was just cold, no flavor. For old fashioned ice cream, the creamy flavor just was not there.  This was the first time I threw it away, just no worth the calories.  The waffle cone was excellent, but nothing else. The floors and tables were filthy, clearly being supervised by just teens. Suggest save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"DEELISH. We had an ice cream sundae with toppings and a malt shake (because we are twelve years old and heart hiding in mid-twenties bodies) and goodness they were delicious. Great service, fun atmosphere, and I will be getting fat here often if anyone needs me."}
{"text":"Ice cream was beyond delicious ! I loved the creamy delicious cappuccino flavor of triple chocolate sundae - so yummy. I would suggest Petersen's as a nice family outing, perfect for friends visiting.  Or take your sweet spouse to grab dessert and walk around the downtown area  Great weather to get an up close perspective of all the fun offerings in Gilbert  We noticed a candy store that we'd never seen as we enjoyed our treats and browsed around"}
{"text":"Cute and clean, with a super helpful staff. Ice cream is good and really creamy--this has replaced Coldstone for us (prices are comparable if not cheaper). The homemade waffle cone/bowl is amazing."}
{"text":"We went yesterday, not their \"grand opening\" yet but things were operating smoothly.  Too bad some other reviewers felt the need to diss this place...when we went, all ice cream flavors were listed on a menu and on little placards near the ice cream itself, garbage can was available, and seating was as much as feasible inside and out without creating a mob scene.  And no one was \"touching themselves.\"  Geez, sounds tittilating.  So, on to the ice cream. The friendly gal helping us happily let us taste all the different flavors we wanted to.  Then made a waffle bowl for my wife.  I got a waffle cone with two flavors.  The pecan praline was quite good.  I also had a standard...mint chocolate chip.  Yeah, I wouldn't say any of their flavors were real exotic, but maybe that's not what people want.  OK, people? Maybe the basics sell best.  And maybe they'll experiment and rotate in some different ones.  My waffle cone dripped though the bottom.  So what?  Am I gonna fault them for it?  Fuhgeddaboutit!  Ice cream drips, capisce?    All in all, all staff were fun and friendly, service was quick (there was no big line when we went on a Saturday night), and the place was clean and bright.  It's a perfect place to get hard ice cream in downtown Gilbert....especially if your tastebuds are singing from some of the spicy food from some of the neighboring eateries.   BTW, they said they'll have more offerings at their grand opening.    I'll be back.  I suggest you do, too."}
{"text":"How anyone gives this place more than one star is beyond comprehension. It's terribly noisy. The ice cream is not made on premises and is just so so. The flavor choices are dismal. The employees didn't seem organized or know their own menu. Their lack of attractive uniform didn't help. The decor is tired, insipid and dull. This place needs a real makeover, New product...it needs class. Why couldn't Frost locate downtown instead of San Tan Mall? As a food destination Gilbert is doing well, but Petersens is far below the mark."}
{"text":"Fresh waffle bowls and yummy ice cream! I had the New York Cherry and it was delish! Big chunks of sweet black cherries in cherry ice cream. They had Superman ice cream too-one of my childhood faves! The fresh waffle bowl made right before my eyes-now that was fantastic! It was a busy Saturday night but I got my ice cream very quickly! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome little ice cream place. Logan was super awesome and very friendly. Would recommend to anyone driving through Gilbert or near. Ice cream is so delicious and creamy. Checkout the root beer too!"}
{"text":"Try their chocolate milk shake... Its Fire. With the abundance of trendy fro-yo and gelato places Petersen's is a breath of fresh air, when your being smothered by trendy candy crush flavors and insain jaw breaker toppings from other places. We went here because it was a favorite hang out spot of my mother in-law who grew up in Chicago, which is where petersens is originally from. The new local in AZ got her stamp of approval and is easily one of my favorite good old fashioned ice cream shops. Their ice cream alone is amazing and tastes like its make with quality ingredients. Creamy and delicious, we will be repeat customers for sure.  UPDATE: Ordered an ice cream cake from here and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy ice cream.  A great way to end a lovely evening.   Ordered the moose tracks. Liked the fact that it was not overwhelmed by the chocolate   The turtle on the other hand was not as good. There needs to be at least some caramel running through the chocolate"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?!?!!! I totally and absolutely love the feel right when you walk through the door but the ice cream.  Now that's the real star of the show. Banana pudding and strawberry cheesecake.  Yummmmm then there was pistachio almond. I'm in pink and white heaven. Or a sugar coma:)"}
{"text":"Finally a place that know how to make a frapachino. Went there for the first time Today. Fortunately not busy,funny when its 115 out people wont even go for Ice cream . We sat inside our grand daughter had a sherbet while my wife had a small ice cream. All top quality creamy the way ice cream should be. I HAD The Frap not the Starbucks excuse cut a smooth wonderful drink with double shot of expreeso. Service behind the counter was great giving us taste and no rushing. I will need to check out there Italian  sandwiches next and a shake."}
{"text":"We went opening week and the line was out the door but moved quickly. I was super impressed with the service, we were offered water while we were waiting and the staff made sure that our order was taken. The ice cream was delicious, hot fudge is a MUST! We will definitely be back, was well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I don't go out for ice cream often, but I am a fan of old ice cream parlors. Petersen's is a cute little ice cream shop nestled within downtown Gilbert's long row of restaurants. Its pink and teal colors along with the wallpaper of old fashioned photos gives it that old ice cream parlor feel. The neon sign out front says established in 1919. That's because a Danish immigrant by the name of Hans Petersen opened up his first shop in Chicago that year. His 18% butterfat ice cream recipe mixed in with fruits and nuts has stood the test of time. In addition to a variety of flavors, they also have brownie sundaes, ice cream donut sandwiches, floats and ice cream bars. I stopped in after a downtown Gilbert food tasting for a sample of ice cream. The girls working the counter were fun and energetic and my ice cream was perfect for a hot summer evening. Prices are comparable with most other ice cream parlors. Petersen's has been the perfect addition to Gilbert's Heritage District for a quick dessert snack after dinner."}
{"text":"Old-Fashioned ice cream is my jam!! It's so hard to find in AZ too. Everyone wants to get all fancy and weird. Not me! I want the good stuff. And that is what Petersen's has. And with the throw back 50's decor you really feel like you are being sucked back in time.   Something I really loved as well is how nice the service was. There were about 8-10 different people standing around trying different flavors trying to make up their mind's and the 2 people behind the counter were so sweet and helpful. They did not try to rush anyone and were ready to give you any and ever sample.  I unfortunately live in Glendale so I wont be able to come back much but when we come to this part of town this place is going to be a must for me."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a yummy smooth sweet treat after dinner. Unfortunately, it wasn't so. I ordered a half scoop of chocolate chip and a half scoop of NY cherry. Three chocolate chip was grainy, like it had been frozen, thawed, and refrozen, and the cherry had little ice chips in it. The waffle cone was yummy though."}
{"text":"Super cute location in Gilbert (newly open).  I had never been to a Petersons but I loved the 50s theme and the ice cream was delicious.  Be prepared to take your ice cream to go if it's a Friday night ... there is limited seating and the town gets BUSY."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy! I got the warm brownie with banana ice cream and loved it! Abby who worked there made the experience! She was so sweet, nice and fun. Loved it here."}
{"text":"The throwback sign and interior are cute. They were pretty busy so sitting inside would've been noisy and not relaxing.  They tried to help everyone but were not big on smiling. With time I'm hopeful they'll be more efficient and warm. They weren't unfriendly, but maybe a tad overwhelmed?  My husband felt it was expensive and griped about it. A few bites in he said \"This IS really good ice cream\".   Tad confused about a sign saying they served a sandwich. Do they? Doesn't seem like a natural fit or that they're set up for it but...who knows?  If we were in the area and craving ice cream, we might come back. We might also choose to sit at one of the nearby restaurants and order a desert for a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Nice ice cream spot in Gilbert. Great location in the middle of a small town with a ton of lunch/dinner spots. The ice cream was delicious and the waffle cones were made in shop! Friendly workers. Had some pretty cool items on the menu but opted for a scoop of cherry which was great. Would definitely revisit when back in town!"}
{"text":"Customer service was completely lacking. Girl behind the counter couldn't give a shit lol  I asked for 2 scoops in a cup which should have come with toppings but I wasn't asked if I'd like some. The cup was just set on the counter and she walked away. NOW the important part, the ice cream. It was below average. I had Turtle and Cookie Dough. They tasted freezer burnt!  Turtle was okay but just straight chocolate and pecans, no caramel flavor. Cookie dough was awful. Super gritty and hardly any cookie dough. The pieces that were there were almost melted into the ice cream. If you make cookies at your store this should be a shining star!  Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"The peanut butter cup ripple chocolate ice cream... no words to describe how freaking good it is...then smash it between two delicious chocolate chip cookies...I've died and gone to sugar heaven."}
{"text":"The VIBES of this place are everything! Love me some old-fashioned ice cream and classic music. I could sit in here all day and feel right at home. The employees were so kind and helpful, and DANG they know how to give a good sized sample (catch up Cold Stone.) I'm usually not one to choose the multi-colored ice cream but I had to get their birthday cake, which is by far the most different and interesting cake cream flavor I've ever had. (In a good way!!) Super creamy and fresh, and it had what I think were little cake pieces in it. I would eat that flavor alone for the rest of my life. Also, the waffle cone was prime. Nice good crunch and it didn't go soft after eating the ice cream after some time, a big peeve of mine.   You can also get a cookie sandwich or even a DONUT sandwich, yes that's right a DONUT sandwich. I'll definitely be trying that next time. Just overall highly recommend this place after a hearty dinner with the fam. It's a crowd pleaser for sure!"}
{"text":"I hate to spend a lot of money on ice cream. Especially when I know I can buy a 1/2 gallon for the same price. But I was out n about with my daughter and we went to Petersen's for an Ice Cream. My 3 favorite flavors are Chocolate Chip Mint, Chocolate Chip Mint and Chocolate Chip Mint, so guess what I ordered.  Oh My God that was delicious. Not sure how or why but it was soooo good.  The hot fudge didn't hurt either. They probably deserve 5 stars it was just a little expensive but that's ok."}
{"text":"It's as little expensive for what it is. Nothing really made it stand out. Waffle cone was egg shell thin and would crumble apart if you touched it. They also have one tiny trash can overflowing inside, should really upgrade that."}
{"text":"I woke up in the middle of the night craving rocky road ice cream. Honest to goodness, it was 2 am. and i wanted almonds dipped in chocolate swirled with marshmallows. Three hours later I'm at work and I'm craving rocky road ice cream like a pregnant lady craves ice chips. My coworkers, sick of my distraction, decided to take me for ice cream. I walk into Petersen's and almost cry in relief - I'm so close to my rocky road dream!!! I look to the right - no rocky road, I look to the left - also no rocky road. Clearly there must be a mistake, but one look at the stricken faces of my coworkers confirm my fear and my heart sinks in my chest. There is no rocky road at Petersen's.   Depressed I slunk into a chair to wait while my coworkers order various frozen delights when this little teenager behind the counter plops down a depressing looking hot fudge sundae for me. There's no rocky road ice cream, half melted whipped cream and a plump red cherry. I swirled my spoon around and unconsciously take a bite while thinking about my rocky road and I freeze (pun intended). I was in such a state of shock I completely blacked out. I come back to my senses, and look down at the table and there was no more ice cream. No more thoughts of rocky road. There was just me, in a happy sugary cold bliss.   My review: This was the best ice cream I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations of this Ice Cream shop. I had heard so much about it from both my partner's and their families, that I thought I would bring my wife here to see what they were all about.   We were actually on our way to Arcade, and decided to stop by this place.  It is a super cute shop, and the people working here are just so nice and polite. For a bunch of high school kids, their attitude and work ethic were simply remarkable.  Unfortunately, the same can't be said about their Ice Cream. I had the Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake with a scoop of Turtle and Mackinaw Fudge. The Cake didn't taste all that fresh, and it had the consistency of a cupcake. And the Ice Cream was quite bland. On top of that, the nuts that they put as a toppings were fairly tasteless.   My wife had the Raspberry Sorbet with Turtle, and she indicated that Sorbet was delicious, but she was disappointed in the taste of the Hot Fudge. She stated that the fudge taste was off from typical fudge that she is accustomed to.  Perhaps, they were having an off day; and we just need to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"such a cute little retro Ice cream shop! Gilbert blvd is the most happening part of Mesa/Gilbert area and this place is perfect for the after party to wind-down and relax over a cone of ice cream. Their speciality are the donut infused ice creams or the ice cream sandwiches - which are the better deal in my opinion. You get two cookies plus heapings of ice cream in between for less than $5! The quality of ice cream is fresh and sweet, just enough to satisfy that sweet tooth but not make you want to work out right away. The decor of the place is the perfect backdrop for your next Instagram post or group photo. The staff are extremely nice, patient, and helpful when you ask for suggestions! I've been here several times and would definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"This was our third our fourth time coming here but we hadn't been since they opened. This place is filthy inside and out. All the glass above the ice cream, mirrors, glass doors, etc... are covered in grime. The floors are dirty as well and the inside could use a fresh coat of paint and the base boards need to be repaired and replaced in some places. It appears management is either uninvolved it simply doesn't care about the cleanliness or appearance of this store."}
{"text":"So good! I have walked and driven past this place 100 times, and wish I would have stopped in sooner.   This place has a retro old school vibe - yet amazing ice cream. I only had a single scoop tonight, but the New York Cherry is delicious!   Limited seating, and is pretty popular, so that means finding a place to sit down could be a challenge. Indoor and outdoor seating available.   The staff were quick and polite. Got our orders correct.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"A dreamy little ice cream shop with vintage pastel vibes. The sundae pricing includes all toppings, which is awesome, because the prices are already reasonable, and 2 scoops was more than enough for 2 people to share. Had vanilla bean & chocolate chip cookie dough. Both were very creamy and rich, better than Baskin Robbins.   They serve cappacino, lattes, & Americanos, which is perfect to balance the sweet side. Lots of other treats on the menu besides ice cream. Friendly service and located on the downtown Gilbert strip. Good place to grab dessert after a meal at one of the many nearby restaurants. Will be back to try with my daughter!"}
{"text":"Visited 7.15.17.  Walked in and the guy behind the counter immediately engaged myself and my husband, suggesting samples based off our likes. After trying a few different things, I decided on the Caramel Ripple malt, and my husband got the Mackinac Island Fudge cookie sandwich. Both were very good, and the service was superb. I only wish we had tried the place sooner!"}
{"text":"Tried this establishment, in over crowded, downtown Gilbert's contrived old town.  It is so sad that there is nothing to do at night in Arizona.  My posse felt like an ice cream at a shop and this was our alternative to BR.  From East Gilbert, it took 15 driving minutes, then we parked in a dirt lot, (with all the other schlubs,) took pictures on a lit couch, and dutifully marched to our destination which was lined out the door....normally I would have left.  BUT I INVESTED TOO MUCH TIME TO GET THERE.  The prices were high, single ice cream with homemade waffle cone 3.55 or so.  They had donut ice cream sandwiches which looked flat and disgusting to me.  I split a banana split, with others, which was $7.00.  3 scoops of ice cream,  etc.  I couldn't taste the pineapple, strawberry or fudge topping.  Tiny amount of whip cream, nuts, cherry.  The young, skinny crew were adorable and not one spoon of ice cream probably passes their lips...all of us in line were \"fat slobs...\"  If I am going to blow those calories, give me a reason too.  There was inadequate seating inside and out, based on that crowd, you need 10x more tables in your shop...we spent $15,  can we please sit down?  Based on that experience, I wouldn't return to that overpriced, downtown, \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. An Old Fashioned Ice Cream parlor in Downtown Gilbert was absolutely genius. Just driving past Petersen's, I did a double take of the cute, pastel colored exterior and thought to myself, GO THERE! And I am so glad I did. I believe I came in the very first week they opened. I am so glad there was no one behind me and my friend because I took forever to decide what I wanted. I probably sampled more than half of their flavors. And the girls who man the ice cream are more than lovely! So sweet and helpful. They answered all my questions. I gathered that this shop comes from Chicago and this is the first shop outside of there. Their ice cream is not made in house but that didn't take away from the quality to me. After lots of sampling and contemplating, I ended up going with a single scoop in their freshly made waffle cone and it was heaven on earth. The perfect dessert. My friend got the affogato (coffee ice cream with a shot of espresso) and I think if I liked coffee, I would have loved it. If you live in the area or are in the neighborhood, you must go here for dessert! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yum!! We got to enjoy some ice cream here last night!! I had the cappuccino chip which was delectable!! My daughter had superman (colorful bubblegum flavor) and cookie dough and also loved here.  Next time I'm getting their amazing looking donut sundae!! I didn't have room for it last night, but it looks amazing! They've got great sundae options-go check them out!!"}
{"text":"Hot ice cream sandwich was amazing! Needs a new name though.... It's a large doughnut (center still in) that's cut in half, filled with ice cream,  and sealed up again after 15 second in the panini press. Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   I already know this place is going to be a problem. I found out we live within walking distance. I guess the walk there and back can make up for some of it. I had the brownie sundae with 1 scoop of mint chocolate ice cream and it was definitely a generous one. The brownie was oh so warm. And it came with lots of whipped cream and sprinkles. Amazing. You have to go."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Scoop size was tiny, and if you get a yummy waffle cone that is warm, the ice cream immediately turns soft and starts melting.   The display cases were empty.  The owner seems nice, but I will probably go to Baskin Robbins next time because at $6.00 for a double scoop, I'd rather have larger scoops and hard ice cream that stays hard."}
{"text":"Wow! We were SO looking forward to ice cream after dinner tonight. We ordered two ice cream cones with vanilla ice cream with a side of acne scabs.... I'm horrified! The young lady serving us kept picking at her face as she took breaks in between scooping! I tried not to look to justify paying for it but she just wouldn't stop. My husband refused to order & I promised my son he could have ice cream! Needless to say it was $6 not worth spending. Ended up throwing them both away as we walked out! Please train your servers to 1) use gloves when serving and 2) don't touch ANYTHING while serving ice cream other than the cone and scoop after you're gloved up. I worked in food service and that was serving 101!! So sad because we LOVED coming here!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that this shop's ice cream is homemade. The service is wonderful and the music is awesome! We will be back for sure! Thanks Bayley!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Awesome and friendly staff. The HUGE plus is that they have superman ice cream!! I am from the Midwest and have not found anyone in the valley that carries it. You bet I drive 40 mins to get that taste of childhood back! Awesome job Petersens!"}
{"text":"Great old school scoops of ice cream in an old school ice cream parlor.the feature fudge from Mackana  island in Michigan.  Enjoy the shakes and scoops"}
{"text":"Be transported back in time to an era of ice cream parlors and soda fountain shops when you step foot inside Petersen's Ice Cream Cafe.  You'll be greeted by the cafe's cute pastel interior and the friendly employees dressed in true soda jerk fashion: white apron and rectangular hat.   Treat yourself to a single scoop, sundae, milkshake, float or banana split. Ice cream flavors include: rocky road, praline, mint chocolate chip, cookie dough, pistachio and strawberry. Super fans of vanilla will be beside themselves with delight as this spot offers three different kinds: classic vanilla, vanilla chocolate chip, and vanilla bean.   The ice cream is standard but solid. Which isn't a bad thing, but I typically prefer a few more imaginative options. However, they do offer some fun flavors like cinnamon (I like to pretend it is horchata) and Superman (three flavors in shades of blue, red, and yellow -- like the Man of Steel's uniform).  This place might be more about the adorable atmosphere, friendly service, and the fact that you are in downtown Gilbert and are craving a frozen treat, than it is about having a mind-blowing dessert.   In some places when the weather gets colder, ice cream parlors close down during the those months. Luckily for us Zonies, we will never have to worry about being without our frozen treats!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience. The only downside was there were a lot of bugs around the outside of the ice cream containers which was concerning. Otherwise the ice cream was great and the customer service was good."}
{"text":"Been having Superman cravings during this pregnancy and this is the only place that I've found it. Tried other flavors too and it's all pretty good. Reminds me of this little shop I worked at in highschool. The cashier was a little off putting but the ice cream and serving size made up for it."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop has so much charm! The moment I walked in, I was taken back to an old school ice cream parlor. I knew I was at the right place because it was packed on a cold and chilly evening. They have several ice cream flavors and many friendly workers ready to assist you with samples. My favorite ice cream flavor is green mint chip and had to order theirs. It was good but not the best green mint chip I had. Their ice cream is creamy and light but not too thick. Definitely a cute place to go on a date or hang out with friends for dessert."}
{"text":"Went here for desert after having dinner at Joyride taco house.  It was a nice night to be outside walking around downtown Gilbert.  Atmosphere here brings you back to the old school ice cream parlor feeling. I got a double scoop of butter pecan along with a double latte.   Butter pecan ice cream was good, but not as strong in flavor as I'm used to. The extra creaminess of it made up for that.  The Latte was suprisingly very good. They don't give the impression they specialize in coffee but they do an excellent job!  Happy we took we time to stroll down the street to have this experience."}
{"text":"Update: I got a msg. saying that child seating will be available the next time we make a visit! Superman ice cream here I come!   Went to Petersen's on Sunday afternoon with a girlfriend and our two young girls (1yr and 1 1/2yrs) for a girls ice cream day and I was so excited until we were told that they do not have child chairs. I was excited to get the Superman ice cream, but it was kinda difficult to enjoy when we had our daughters on our laps in chairs that were not really made for that. For being smack-dab in the middle of Gilbert, one of the most family-centric towns, you would think that keeping kids in mind for seating would have been considered. The staff was super friendly and I would definitely go back for my childhood ice cream, Superman, but I might have to make a run without my kiddo. :-( If someone that works for Petersen's reads this, please get some child seats for the littlest customers!"}
{"text":"The girl told me I look like Lauren Conrad so I was happy."}
{"text":"Just average.  Ice cream was on the icy side (tried two different flavors).  Had the turtle and the fudge island.  The waffle cone itself is good."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It's fairly cheap, the ice cream is delicious, and the workers are SO friendly!! One employee came to our table outside after we had already paid and were eating our treats and told us she was about to leave for the night, but wanted to see if we needed any napkins, ice water, etc. before she left. We were all so impressed!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. I was very underwhelmed with this place. The customer service was pretty good and flavor choices were also a plus. However, my ice cream had significant amounts of ice chunks in it and my children's did too...almost as if it was old or freezer burned. Just inexcusable at an ice cream parlor that charges you over $3 for a single scoop. We'll be sticking to Baskin Robbins or Coldstone. I really wanted to like this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a several times and this place is still my favorite! The smell when you first walk in is amazing, they make the waffle cones in front of you so the smell is wonderful. The ice cream selection is unique. They have donut sandwiches?!!! If you haven't been it is a downtown Gilbert MUST try!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Joanna Wang - Lost In Paradise)  I know that it might sound strange But you made my palates start to sing It happened so suddenly Like dessert has waited up for me  I've just been Yelping so long Kept eating my dessert wrong  In every order and every size Now my appetite is craving at your sight  Sometimes you think I'm old fashion But I don't know I'll keep it to myself Your sandwich taste so wonderful My smile can show I'm lost at Petersen's   You scream I scream we all scream for Petersen's Ice Cream!  Petersen's is a long established ice cream parlor from the Midwest for over a decade and seems to me finally making it's way West to Gilbert AZ.  The nostalgic feel of this place fits perfectly for downtown Gilbert.  Old fashion ice cream with a twist; on a donut or cookie sandwich!  I had to try their famous Mackinac Island Fudge; fudge swirls with chunky fudge in vanilla ice cream; donut sandwich simply because .... well I do!  Needless to say, the sandwich didn't disappoint!  Warm doughy glazed donut with creamy cold chocolate fudge was a perfect marriage!  This came quite large so I would recommend sharing with your friends unless you're a greedy dessert person.  Then you could also get their cone ice cream cause they were large in portion too!  Petersen also makes their own waffle bowls that's an extra specialty I would definitely go for if you're into sundaes.    Overall, a nice visit to Petersen's.  At first the place seems pretty plan and definitely needs more seating for patrons; couches and high tops perhaps?  I would like to see more flavors, but what they had was fine.  It would be cool if they had a soda jerk machine that would actually work.   In the end, it's good'o fashion ice cream with some old fashion fun! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love ice cream! It is great having a new ice cream establishment to visit. The only other place we know to get scoopable ice cream is Baskin Robbins 31 flavors on Greenfield & Main or McClintock & Southern which are both quite far from our humble abode. The good:  We were pleasantly surprised by the number of flavors offered.  The pink & white striped walls & the menu written in blackboard were cute. The menu consisted of sundaes, scoops, shakes, rootbeer floats, pre-packed pints & pre-packs quarts in a cooler as well as bottled soda in a cooler. There were samples of waffle cone on the counter. The not so good: The menu options weren't as varied as some places, for example, there was only 1 size rootbeer float & shake.  Marshmallow is spelled incorrectly & there is an apostrophe s on the word SUNDAES on the blackboard menu.  The straw in my shake would NOT work. I went to the front to wait patiently for a spoon (there were none in my reach) but was ignored until my husband went directly to an employee who was scooping ice cream for another customer. It was Sunday afternoon & there were only 2 teenage employees in the entire store, which resulted in a long line. The seating area was pretty small so we were lucky to get a seat inside.  The chairs were padded with metal backs so it isn't a place you can comfortably sit down & enjoy your dessert like you can at Friendly's in Ohio or MacAlpine's Soda Fountain in Phoenix.  There was only 1 garbage can & it was overflowing."}
{"text":"As far as ice cream goes, everything tastes and smells really good. It's just not what I was expecting or hoping for as far as atmosphere. I thought it would resemble an old school ice cream parlor and soda fountain but it doesn't. The sign on the back of the building is also confusing because it says they have Italian beef and other savory items that they definitely don't have when walking inside. I ordered a 1 scoop sundae and it was over $5. Very pricy! We also saw the employees not wearing gloves and touching their hands on their faces and surfaces while making the cones and serving the food, which was off putting.  Overall, very average to me. DQ is just down the street and is half the price."}
{"text":"This little ice cream shop in the heart of Downtown Gilbert is very quaint with its decor similar to an old ice cream parlor. Customer service here is also great; everyone is very welcoming, fast, and helpful. There are many types of ice cream creations: floats, sundaes, sandwiches, donut sandwiches, etc which makes it a great place for fun foods/meeting place for friends with different tastes. My only dislike is the ice cream itself. Some flavors are ok while others are seriously lacking and is a problem given that this is an ice cream establishment. I have yet to find a flavor that satisfies my taste 100%."}
{"text":"\"Sweet\" place!   We got the banana split with 3 scoops of our choice. Was very tasty and didnt taste like cheap ice cream either. Will def go back to cure a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"This place is in a great location. Is it out of this world ice cream? No. Do they have a ton of options? Yes. The fact is that it's a nice place for dessert if your eating in old town. There are tons of other options if you are not down there. Otherwise, stop by and get some ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is the place to go for a delicious shake. That's exactly what I had...nice creamy, smooth, delicious strawberry shake. They had many varieties of ice cream, shakes, banana splits, coffee and many, many toppings for whatever you want on your ice cream. I will definitely come back here whenever I'm in this area. The staff was great and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the flavors I grew up with in the Midwest. They have mackinaw island fudge, blue moon and superman ice cream which is not available in Phoenix. The location is awesome and we enjoyed our treat on the patio to oldies music."}
{"text":"6:55pm on a Sunday. Strolled in for a cup of ice cream for myself and my wife.    They were out of Moose Tracks which is the only ice cream I've ever had here.  Instead of offering up another variety our \"server\" just blamed someone else by saying \"I don't do the ordering\". That took me off guard as we have always had great service here.    Wifiepoo got a cup of ice cream and our \"server\" completely ignores me and asked he next person in line what he wants.  Wife says \"we are together\" and \"server\" boy says \"I only serve people who are ready to order \".  Like WTF!?!?  I was ready to order a different flavor.  This pissed me off beyond belief and my wife left her cup on the counter and we left.  I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  This is an ice cream parlor from Chicago that serves ice cream that is light and creamy.  The cinnamon is especially delicious.  I got the cookies and cream and cookie dough flavor.  If you order one scoop, they can do half and half and give you two flavors, which I thought was really nice.  They also have Mackinaw Island fudge here, which any Michigander will appreciate."}
{"text":"Have to try the ice cream filled donut!!! Where has it been all my life! It is a glazed donut filled with ice cream & toppings of your choice. Then warmed up in a panini griddle... Warm gooey outside, cold creamy filling!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have an ice cream spot in Downtown Gilbert especially next to all the great restaurants. It's a great location. The ice cream tastes like \"ice cream\" It tastes just as the same as Water and Ice except for only half the price.  I will most likely come here after a nice dinner or to just sit in an ice cream shop. You are paying for the ambiance and location. On a Sunday afternoon they need more than 2 people behind the counter cause the line can get lengthy."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE GREEN RIVER SODA O MY GOSH THEY HAVE GREEN RIVER SODA!!!  Ok, so outside of the fact that they have Green River Soda, which you can tell I'm a fan of (a crappy but sentimental Chicago tradition), this is a SOLID SOLID SOLID Ice Cream spot. A perfect way to top off your downtown Gilbert dining experience.   It's a smaller venue, so you may want to get your order to go or spot a table you think you might want to sit at.   I ordered a double scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough, which is by far my most favorite ice cream... Of all time. They are generous with their portions (bring it on) so you'll never feel skimped (one scoop was... Probably all I needed in hindsight--- but Ice Cream, amiright?).   Their staff is friendly, and the place was clean, without the typical sticky syrupy ice cream countertops and tables. Great job guys, I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was great and wade katie was a great ice cream maker man 10/10 it's great"}
{"text":"Oooh this place is so delicious! I got an ice cream sandwich with a brownie and a cookie with banana ice cream yummm"}
{"text":"Cute old fashioned icecream place. ... Can't go wrong with icecream. Will definitely come back. Got the almond pistachio and Eskimo kisses. The Eskimo is a coconut with mackinac chocolate. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The exterior of this spot makes you super hopeful and excited about this ice cream spot. The storefront is adorable and romantic in the 50s high school way. They play oldies music outside and there are colorful wired chairs that look 50s-ish. I saw that they sold sundaes, shakes, ice cream & hot dogs. Their ice cream flavors were mostly basic: chocolate, three different types of vanilla, mint chocolate, sherbet, lemon sorbet, raspberry sorbet, etc. The more unique flavors included blue moon, superman, cinnamon & pistachio almond. The texture of the ice cream was nice but the flavor was a little bland. The price is costlier than the quality of the ice cream."}
{"text":"So. Good.   Cinnamon ice cream = da bomb. So happy to have found a place that carries it even when it isn't the holiday season. The Moose Tracks and Mint Chocolate Chip were great, too!   The line was a little slow, but they are still trying to find their rhythm after the recent opening.   Will definitely be back to give the other favors a try!"}
{"text":"I'm normally very basic and I rarely ever try anything new, but tonight my boyfriend convinced me to try the butter pecan ice cream so I did with a waffle come( which they make there right when you order them) and let me tell you! So good! Can't wait to go back! Was our first time in and we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Super good ice cream!!! They treated our kids great and were very patient with them.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"The Donut Sandwich is worth driving from where ever you are to get. Choose your ice cream flavor. Choose your toppings. Then stick it in a waffle iron. What you get is unimaginable. Incredible. I had pecan praline ribbon with Nutella topping. Amazing! Went with friends and its counter service. A group takes a little time but it's a great space! Price is more expensive than most but worth it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stepping into Petersen's is like a blast from the past. You'd think you were walking into an ice cream parlor in the 50's or 60's. They have 30 different flavors to choose from. They also have sundaes, ice cream sodas, rootbeer floats, and other ice cream yummies.  I was super happy to find out they have blue moon, my favorite! So, of course I got one scoop of blue moon in a waffle cone. The waffle cone was made right as I ordered it. Yum!  The store was clean and bright. I can't wait to come here for a treat again when I am in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The ice cream, waffle cones and service was great but a bit expensive which is why I give 4 stars instead of 5. Atmosphere was also nice, I would recommend trying."}
{"text":"Very cute shop. Yummy ice cream. Owner came and checked on us while we were eating. Concern would be limited seating during the after dinner rush"}
{"text":"They have a good selection of ice cream. I just got 1 scoop which was huge and the bf got a brownie sundae. Both were delicious. Prices weren't too bad for ice cream. Comparable to cold stone.  The part that bothered me was there was no organization to ordering. People were lined up but they would just yell out who's order can they take. It was strange. They were also all young kids working. Good food, unorganized, slow service."}
{"text":"Most amazing brownie ice cream sandwiches! I ordered it with Cappuccino Ice cream and of course hot fudge topping! So delicious! I should have split it with someone as it's very rich but was so hungry after SUP'n on Salt River I inhaled it!"}
{"text":"If you have Midwest roots, this is the place for blue moon and superman ice cream fix"}
{"text":"I've found my favorite ice cream spot.  Took my kids here last night. We had a great time.  Ice cream was delicious, waffle cones smelled and tasted terrific, and the price was very reasonable.  We shared a huge scoop of chocolate ice cream for only  $3.50!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE ice cream. I don't think it's possible for a dessert to be excellent unless it includes ice cream. Since I have a great love of ice cream, I'm also fairly picky when it comes to it. I don't eat it all that often (you know, because health), so when I do eat it I want only the best! It needs to be made from high quality ingredients and not taste artificial in any way. It also needs to be firm, but not too firm, and be creamy without leaving a film in your mouth.  Petersens does it all. There is a large selection with rare flavors that are sure to please anyone. I personally love the Mackinac Island Fudge ice cream. I've had many of their other flavors, but I continue to go back to this one. Tonight I also had one of their house made waffle cones, and it was absolutely delicious.   As for their service, they have always been really nice. Yes, they do seem to hire really young people, but they all seem to be genuinely nice kids that care about their job. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Here we are on a cold rainy afternoon getting ice cream. Not bad. They are from Chicago and have some interesting concoctions. I have never seen an ice cream donut before and it looks so delicious. When it gets warmer, I will definitely be heading this way."}
{"text":"They had me at Blue Moon ice cream. Add mackinac island fudge to that and I'm half tempted to quit nursing and apply for a job. I've been gone from Michigan since 1998, but I fondly remember my favorite ice cream. I cannot believe I'm tasting it again. This place is awesome! The atmosphere is fun and cheery with the friendliest service I've had in this state. Logan blew me away with his upbeat attitude and huge smile. He also sang along to the oldies hits and made us all laugh. When we were done he came to our table to ask how we enjoyed everything. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"There aren't a vast amount of ice cream places around Gilbert, but as soon as Petersen's opened, I knew I had to try it.   Brand new, friendly employees, and amazing ice cream! They're best known for their cappuccino ice cream flavor, and I have to say, I now know why they're known for it. Not only do the workers greet every customer with a smile, but they are not hesitant or slow to act when asked by a customer. Also, it being new and very clean is definitely a bonus!   Ice cream isn't all that they serve too, they have a variety of fudge, coffee, and even sandwiches! This is definitely a family-friendly place, and the playlist that they have on in the mid afternoon will definitely make you feel like you're back in an old ice cream parlor! And the best part? Everything is totally affordable!  I intend on coming back here often, and I definitely recommend the cappuccino ice cream!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! The waffle cone is amazing! And the ice cream is so smooth. Not to mention the service! Everyone is soooooo sweet. Deffinitely coming here again and again and... Again!"}
{"text":"Fun cool ice cream place I recommend the ice cream filled donut filling and very good friendly staff."}
{"text":"As a treat I decided enjoy a rare ice cream. I don't eat much of it because it's so good and bad. I went for the Pecan Praline and Caramel. A scoop of each in a Waffle cup. I was very pleasantly surprised with how rich and smooth it was. Some of the best I've had in some time. I did find it hard looking at the menu. Everything looked so good and I could just imagine all the delicious calories going to my waist. I will be back. Sitting out front enjoying a treat and watching the people go by ended up being very nice end to my evening."}
{"text":"Such a cute place!  I really felt like I was back in the day.  I shared a brownie dessert and it was as delish."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I'm at an ice cream joint back home in Michigan. They have Blue Moon! If you're from that area, you know the significance of this :) The staff is super friendly, the location is clean, prices are good."}
{"text":"Cutest little place and I am so happy to see that Gilbert Road is finally livening up and has a dessert option! They have a good variety of cold treats! I got the pizookie & my hubby went with a good 'ole cone! It was yummy but mine was enough to share!"}
{"text":"I love ice cream and this place is at the top on my list Fave flavor so far is cappuccino chip"}
{"text":"This place has awesome ice cream sodas and huge ice cream sandwiches where you get to pick the cookies and ice cream."}
{"text":"Lots of ice cream! So much I couldn't even finish! I got the fudge ice cream in a brownie bowl. And we got the original sundae. So good"}
{"text":"Owner/Manager needs to mystery shop.  We drove over after a Mesa concert to check out Petersen's.  My daughter wanted ice cream.  I wanted food.  Shop names says Ice Cream & Cafe.  Really disappointed when we got there and there was no food.  Two young guys serving.  Told us they were out of hot fudge (say what???) then one guy gave my daughter 1/2 a scoop while the other guy gave me a whole scoop - same price - same order (say what!!!).  Outside seating was available and it was a pleasant but but why was it all outside?  What if I wanted to sit inside (right...).  Ice cream was really good.  The rest of the experience was not."}
{"text":"I was expecting really good ice cream. This ice cream is nothing better than what you can buy at any local grocery store. I was extremely dissapointed after having a solid meal at the So Cal Taco place down the road. The best ice cream around is still Jeni's in Columbus OH. I wish they opened in AZ, it would be perfect since I come down here quite often."}
{"text":"I really want to hope that it was just a bad night for this place. I got cookie dough I cream on a cookie sandwhich. The ice cream had NO flavor what so ever, it tasted like frozen chunks of ice. I'm not sure if it was freezer burned or what but it was very disappointing. I ate a few bites and had to dump he rest. The cookie it came on wasn't much better. My husband thought his was fine and I tasted his pecan praline and it was ok. This place is definitely not 4 star worthy though. Disappointing, I was hoping for a real ice cream place around here."}
{"text":"Good ice cream. Great customer service. My boyfriend and I enjoy taking our child to get ice cream here on the weekends. Nice variety of flavors and great tasting ice cream."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and while my ice cream tasted great... The service was mediocre. When we walked in no one welcomed us or offered us help. We stared blankly for 5 min before the employees turned around from their conversation to ask if we needed help."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream as usual. Super impressed with Kyle working all by himself on a Sunday afternoon with a line out the door. Kept his cool and gave everyone great service!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ice cream I've had in AZ. There's a variety of flavors you can try which are all equally delicious. They are very generous with samples so try everything out. I recommend the carrot cake, fudge, and cappuccino flavors. The place also has a nice sit down area, is reasonably priced, has great customer service, and in an awesome location since it's in Downtown Gilbert. There's ample parking behind the place so that's not an issue either. I'll definitely be back to try the sundaes."}
{"text":"I don't get what is special about this ice cream shop. The ice cream is just meh, tastes like Dreyer's (not made in house or even artisan quality). Sure, it has a cute old fashioned parlor vibe but there is very little seating and the flavors are pretty typical.  Its nice that there is an ice cream shop in downtown Gilbert, I just wished it were higher quality."}
{"text":"Me and my friend's time of interaction with the employees was all together, less than three minutes. In those three minutes two seconds of it was enjoyable because that was the time it took us to try one flavor. The male employee (either Zack or Logan not sure they don't wear nametags) rolled his eyes when we ordered. The order was not exactly what you could categorize under the word \"complicated\". It was a waffle bowl, one scoop cinnamon, one scoop chocolate chip cookie dough. Dude tells his coworkers want two bowls with two scoops each. So we correct him and he rolled his eyes again. Like I don't understand how I was getting so much attitude from him not being able to understand a set of instructions that was under twenty words. Then we went to pay and asked to split it. I had cash and my friend was paying with card and instead of doing it directly down the middle I just gave him four bucks and said thy she was gonna pay the rest on her card. Dude fumbled with the computer (which is not that hard to navigate bc I have worked in the food industry) for 15 seconds gave up and just told us to take the ice cream and leave. Yeah we got free ice cream out of that, but the customer service is the whole point of reviews. If you fail at customer service, that will be the first and last thing to be in your mind when you leave a business. He can do better and I hope he does."}
{"text":"They relocated from old town Scottsdale. This location is super cute and all the flavors are just as good as they were in Scottsdale.   I love petersons. The best ice cream I have ever had in my life. It's addicting and now I only want to eat their ice cream.   Perfect for dinner dates then a quick walk here for a cone."}
{"text":"What a cute ice cream shop with their pink and white candy striped walls and white parlor chairs. They have some awesome flavors and add new ones every season. Their shakes are smooth and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"From the outside it just looks extremely cute and that vibe continues a little bit on the inside, but that's about all I liked about it. This is my first time and I was at a complete loss as to what to do after I walked in. I didn't know where the line started, I didn't know how to order, I didn't know how to get their attention, nor was I greeted.   There is one thing that really bothered me.  It was how unclean and unsanitary the employees were. The cases for the ice cream had hinges that were falling apart and the employees were using the same pairs of disposable gloves to try to fix the broken hinges and broken doors as they were to get their sample spoons out of their dirty apron pockets and provide samples to customers. I noticed an employee go to the back, get a new tub of ice cream, bring it back out front, put it in the ice cream case, and continue serving ice cream all while he used the same pair of gloves. The aprons of the employees were filthy.  Definitely not a place I would ever go again."}
{"text":"The ice cream flavors weren't anything too exciting and the employees indeed would touch themselves and handle cones soon after. The service was slow & understandably so, since it's their opening day. There was no definite leader/manager, which I'm sure made it all the more stressful. On a side note, a couple things on the menu were spelled wrong. To be a professional and reputable business, that should be fixed. The menu, chalked on the wall, looked as though someone in high school wrote it. Hopefully that gets fixed soon.   All in all, mediocre ice cream, sub-par service, and they should invest in more seating inside and a garbage can somewhere perhaps?"}
{"text":"I just finished up a trip to Peterson's with 20 middle school students for a field trip. Wow, what a great experience! There was only one man working, unfortunately, I didn't catch his name. He was remarkable! I'm sure many would feel overwhelmed by seeing all those kids come in, but he handled the group perfectly. He served up anything they wanted with a huge smile on his face! High praise for Peterson's. I will definitely return if I ever make it out to Gilbert again."}
{"text":"Went here last night right before closing and the staff was amazingly gracious and friendly. But let's talk ice cream!! Wonderful flavors - got a freshly made waffle cone with a double scoop of chocolate peanut butter (possibly the best I've ever had!) and Mackinac Island fudge. Wow!! They even sell the fudge!!!   Seriously, delicious ice cream and super friendly and helpful staff. Go there!!"}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is a gem in old town Gilbert. It is such a cute place with an inviting atmosphere. It has that old fashioned ice cream parlor vibe. The decor, menu, and the uniforms worn by employees give this establishment that special flair. The menu will have you salivating long before you even place your order.   My wife and I decided to stop by this place because of the long line. When I see a line at any business serving food, it's a good give away that the place is dishing up something tasty and worth waiting for. That was definitely the case here. I ordered a brownie sundae and it was amazing! The brownie was soft with a subtle crunch and the chocolate ice cream was out of this world. I'd of given this place a 5 star review, but there were a couple of reasons why they missed the mark.  The young lady that took my order was a bit confused by my \"what flavors of chocolate do you have\" question. Perhaps she misunderstood what I was asking, but once she had registered the question; she rambled off 6 or so different flavors. I couldn't keep up with what she had said so I just settled with plain chocolate. I walked over to the register and when my \"sundae\" had arrived, it was just a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top of a brownie. I asked the young lady if that is how they make a sundae and she said I hadn't mentioned any other toppings. The gentleman at the register offered to make it with all the fixings, but by this time the line was enormous. He charged me half price for the mixup and that was good enough for me. That was an amazing dessert regardless! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a chain from Chicago that started in 1919.  Has a cool Happy Days vibe.  I had 2 chocolate scoops, wife got a cone with vanilla and peach, and we got our daughter birthday cake ice cream.  I personally prefer gelato but this was good.    There are a few tables inside and outside."}
{"text":"Ice cream is made in house per the cashier. Good amount of ice cream flavors but I wasn't too impressed. I tried the butter pecan and Superman. Below average compared to other ice cream shops. Also felt like we were bothering the young cashier with our order. He definitely did not want to be there that day."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! For the last month I've been on an ice cream/brownie cookie sandwich kick and luckily this place was open the night I had a craving! I had a brownie with a huge scoop of ice cream topped with fudge. The brownie was soft and delicious. I wondered if the ice cream was made in-house or where it was from but that was pretty good too. I would recommend this spot if you're in town and want something to satisfy your sweet tooth. The decor inside is retro and makes it feel family-friendly."}
{"text":"Edit: The owner personally apologized and made the situation right. Late night runs to Petersen's are back on! :)   This is my favorite place to get ice cream. It is always delicious and has become a place that I really like to frequent. However, I had an experience that may have me looking elsewhere for my ice cream fix. On Saturday they close at 11. I got off work at 10 and drove there to get a late night snack. After parking and walking to the door it was around 10:40. The doors were closed, lights were off and the two employees inside were cleaning up. If you don't want to be open that late change the hours listed. It really sucks to go out of your way to get something and the employees just decide that they don't feel like working their full shift and close early."}
{"text":"This place was pretty empty when we came in, and we had never been to a Petersen's before, so we decided to give it a shot.   The ice cream was good, but nothing that blew us away.  I would have given it two stars as a \"meh,\" but the guy behind the counter was friendly and let us try several different flavors... so +1"}
{"text":"Old fashioned Chicago style ice cream in Az. Sign me up! Great variety of flavors. Love the homemade waffle cones. Fudge is some the best I've had. Terry & staff do a fantastic job running this place. Can't wait to return with family."}
{"text":"This is more like 3.5 stars.  I liked things about this place.  Good customer service, variety of choices, cute place.  I just was not wowed by the ice cream I had, it looked really good, but it seemed a little bland.  Maybe it was the ice cream I ordered.  The one with the Fudge chunks in it.  I thought that would be good.  I tried a sample, and I thought wow this will be awesome.  It did not hold up after a few bites for me.  It's a cute place, I want to like it more.  Perhaps if I order something different.  I will try it again and see sometime.  In the meantime, it's Sweet Republic for me!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was good, waffle cones were stale. Most disappointing was the condition of operations behind the counter. Super messy. They need to wipe down counters and put the box of Krustez Waffle Cone mix away :|  The line was long but moved quickly."}
{"text":"Best peach ice cream in town! Cute decor, music, and antique sign make you feel like you're back in Chicago!"}
{"text":"There are only two places that can make me feel stress free and like a kid again, Disneyland and Petersen's Ice Cream & Cafe. I love this location's atmosphere, music, energy and (of course) ice cream! They have tons of creative options and let you sample anything! This is important to me because I'm always very indecisive. I love the fresh mint chip, the very sweet birthday cake and good o'fashioned pralines and cream. I appreciate the fact that the staff will let you sample and not judge you at the same time. \"I do this cause I can't make up my mind! I promise I will order one! It's just two or three is too much...\"   If I wasn't so sensitive to dairy and could eat and not gain a pound, I'd probably be here every night. No joke."}
{"text":"Great Ice cream...ok, maybe the best in all of Glibert.  The old school feel of the ice cream parlor is fun and inviting.  This place is a great addition to the neighborhood for a date night treat or somewhere to go and relax.  As far as the prices go... I think that you get what you pay for, and I do not mind paying for good ice cream.  For the people who complain about price, I guess they can go to Dairy Queen for a dilly bar or blizzard.  Love this place and I plan on being a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Naomi made my first experience here amazing! I highly recommend this spot! Right in the middle of old town Gilbert. I had the cappuccino ice cream in a waffle cone and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"The homemade waffle cones, creamy and delicious mint chocolate chip ice cream, and friendly staff made this ice cream trip worth it. This place is so cute and it reminds me of the places I used to go with my grandparents when I was little. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to take my parents that were open later then normal and we stumbled into here.   Place has been around forever according to the sign and is located right around all the good restaurants.    The ice cream isn't as fancy as their specialties that they have.  You can get a doughnut ice cream sandwich that loomed really good.  We kept it basic but loved the ice cream.  Note to everyone coming it does get packed but they work pretty fast"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned ice cream. That's what they have here. We stopped here for a sweet tooth fix after lunch down the street. They have about 30 different flavors. They even have blue moon ice cream which you only find once in a blue moon. I ordered a scoop of New York cherry. After I was almost finished the guy offered me another scoop on the house. He apologized for the first scoop being a little small. I did enjoy the ice cream. It was a good quality."}
{"text":"I've been to Petersen's two or three times and every time I was satisfied. It's a cute little ice cream parlor in downtown Gilbert surrounded by tons of other restaurants which is so convenient because sometimes you eat too much during lunch/dinner that you decline dessert but then after walking around a bit, you decide you can go for something sweet and Petersen's is right there. I always end up getting two scoops in a waffle cone, the cones smell so good and they're made right in front of you. This is really a double edged sword because it's delicious and hot but now your ice cream is melting much faster than usual and now it's dripping out of the small hole at the bottom and it's a big mess but whatever, I just deal with it. I've tried a few flavors - cookies and cream, cookie dough, butter pecan, and I think NY cherry and they were all super creamy and tasty. Last time my husband and I went it was literally after I said I wasn't in the mood while we were in town and we almost made our way to the highway when I was like, \"actually...\" so we turned around and it was free ice cream for their 2 year anniversary! Score!"}
{"text":"Great staff and very helpful on their different selections. Currently in the Grand Opening stages right now and they've ran out of flavors, but that just means come back again! The ice cream was extremely delicious, but be patient since they get surges of people to make busy lines."}
{"text":"Went to Petersens tonight, expecting a benign, even pleasant, ice cream parlor experience. I went with my family, and there were lots of ohhs and ahhs about how cute it was, and with free samples it felt like a throwback to our childhood. My sister and her husband got a two scoop sundae that was about five scoops, so I got one scoop, which was one scoop. Fair. Who orders one scoop? The ice cream was a lot softer and more bland than other ice cream parlors. A bummer. Then, my brother-in-law pointed out that the wall was moving--because of a crazy amount of bugs crawling on it and a few buzzing and flying around our heads. One landed in front of my niece, who panicked. The bug wall was gross, and I suddenly was glad that the ice cream hadn't even been worth eating. Then my sister looked over, and said, \"Molls, there's something on your shoulder.\" I looked at my shoulder and wondered how a big chocolate covered something could have gotten there. Had a child flung ice cream around? Did my sister reach for a bite and it fell from her spoon? Then I realized that the big chocolate covered something was a bug as it scuttled down my shirt sleeve, totally creeping me out with its tiny legs leaving a trail of paranoia in their wake. Needless to say, I panicked like my three year old niece and ran out. I may or may not have been yelling roach... to be fair to the bug, I'm by no means an expert on bugs, as I try to avoid them. It remains an unidentified ice cream eating (I'm assuming) large, black, scary, scuttley insect. There was another (smaller) bug on my foot when I got outside, not to mention more big beetle-like bugs right outside the door. Maybe it's the neon? I don't know. I don't care. I need to go take a shower because I feel like those bugs are on me. Ew, ew, ew! Gross. Grosser. Grossest. I love ice cream, but after that, pretty sure I won't be eating any for a long time."}
{"text":"\"What makes me happy is just curling up in with my mom in her bed and watching a marathon of 'CSI' and 'Grey's Anatomy' episodes with pints of ice cream.\" ? Taylor Swift  Petersen's is a retro-esque ice cream parlor in Downtown Gilbert.  This Chicago gem is too cute in its pink, white, and minty glory!  Jesse, the young gentleman that served us on Thursday afternoon, was fantastic.  He was helpful, friendly, suggested some samples for us to try, and even told us fun facts about Petersen's (i.e. The fancy cask of root beer on the counter actually just dispenses Mug root beer!).  Being extremely full from lunch at Joyride, my pal Linh and I decided to share an affogato.  That espresso was strong!  Pairing it with their cappuccino ice cream made for an extreme caffeine rush.  Like that ATC song from 2000, it made my heart beat, \"like a drum, like a drum (dam dam dam).\"  Other yummy ice cream flavors includes cinnamon, pistachio almond, and Mackinac Island fudge.  Superman is also great.  It's a colorful rainbow swirl that tastes of good old bubblegum.  Yum.  Another great thing about this place is that they serve maltshakes.  I have a great weakness for malts.  Ice cream sodas, root beer floats, sundaes, frappes, meatball sandwiches, Chicago dogs, and a surplus of coffee-related items are also on the menu so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Loved the root beer float! Wit free refill of root beer too. Great selection and late night options too with quick food bites too. Malts available too ... Great new spot in downtown Gilbert"}
{"text":"The ice cream was just fantastic! The birthday cake ice cream is just like a homemade funfetti cake! Nathan helped us out and was so patient, and let me try almost all the flavors before I came to a decision :) when his shift was over he even came by our table to make sure we had everything we needed. Fantastic customer service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream in town. I drove from the Westside (45 mins) just to endulge. I ordered mint chip and added oreo cookies. I love the nostalgic decor. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I dont know if the staff was new but I asked for a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a cup for my son...the first attempt-he had it on a cone, so I asked him for it in a cup again minus the cone because my did not want a cone. He took the ice cream and put it in a cup overflowing with the ice cream-I asked for him to put it in a larger cup so it isn't melting all over the place...which was the original reason why I asked for it to be in a cup. He hands me a larger cup to put it in-I finally just asked another employee do it."}
{"text":"Good ice cream but nothing really spectacular. Very expensive and small scoops."}
{"text":"I love this place and am so excited to have it open in Gilbert. From the old fashion set up with the Patel colors to the smell of fresh waffle cone, I was in heaven.  My husband and I initially went on their grand opening and it was totally worth the wait.  We now make it our ritual to go there after any dinner/ lunch we partake on in downtown Gilbert.   I saw some people complaining about trash cans and prices compared to DQ up the street.  Never had an issue with garbage cans.. im pretty sure they have the normal amount a store would have (maybe those ppl need a dumpster to be happy? ) and sure.. you can go to DQ up the road, but their service is not even half as good and I found a hair in my chocolate dipped cone the only time I ever went (& never went back).  There is always a fun happy greeting and a smiling face when I go into Peterson's. Also im not gonna lie we have sampled a lot and switch up our order and have never been disappointed.  Seriously so good! Def. go and get your ice cream on !!"}
