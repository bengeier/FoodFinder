{"text":"Je ne sais pas si je suis tombé sur la dite Denise, mais le service était digne d'un \"petit café\"; 45 minutes pour recevoir un Cheese Burger sec, une bière qui goûte le fond de baril et des frites pas cuites! Denise qui m'appelle \"Bea\" comme si on avait passé nos étés ensemble à Old Orchard, bref un 16$ mal investi!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast. Was hoping for more.   Had the  Arizona omelet Pretty sure it had El Paso salsa on it. But the rest of the breakfast was just ok."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere...  plenty of parking in the back of restaurant.  Definitely a recommendation for people looking to have breakfast and lunch with large groups."}
{"text":"Petite découvert et pas déçu, service et déjeuner parfait."}
{"text":"Amazing place! We always go here when we are in St. Saveur. The owner is very friendly and food tastes delicious. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour fêter un ami en groupe. Le saumon était délicieux aussi bien que le filet mignon! Le personnel était de plus très agréable et avenant (merci Ben!). Nous y retournerons c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Service was not that great, asked for smoked salmon benedict and got smoked meat instead. Apart from that the food was good you get alot of food for your money. I'd go back."}
{"text":"We will return! Lots of breakfast/brunch choices to choose from. Tried the duck/brie Benedict which was delish! And the sausage is a must try! Arrived around 10:30am but the crowd was picking up around noon. Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Saturday midday on Canadian Thanksgiving and the place was packed. I'd been here once before and I think this is totally normal. If you're a group of more than 2, be prepared to wait. If you value personal space, this probably isn't the place for you. 

The choice is very wide, with sweet and savoury breakfasts. The service is extremely friendly and helpful and quick. We didn't wait to get served, nor did we wait when we ordered more hot water or extra toast. 

We chose the eggs Benedict with spinach and cheese, and Ben's fricassee. I had the fricassee, which was potatoes, sausage, ham, peppers and onions, mixed with hollandaise sauce (you could also have tomato) au gratin. The server recommended the half portion, though I'd have gone for the full. It was indeed enough. It came with a round of toast and a little fruit on the side. I asked for more toast and got two extra rounds. My beloved didn't fancy the cheddar the eggs Benedict normally came with and was able to swap it for Brie. It was served with what they term a \"mountain of fresh fruit\", and I have to say the portion was copious. Special mention to the fruit, which was varied (melon, watermelon, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, orange), fresh and not freezing cold and hard as it so often is. You could actually taste it and it was good!

At just under $30, including tax, tea and a large grapefruit juice, this was a well worth-it experience."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I don't speak French and everyone spoke English and was very nice. I had the smoked salmon Benedict."}
{"text":"Came for a nice Breakfast on Saturday Morning and Au Petit Cafe  was open so gave it a try.
 
 The girl told us to sit where we wanted .  I looked around and the food looked great I was excited. 

  The ceilings are high gloss and reflect more outdoor light, and the bar had a blue 
LED light made it more modern with the traditional.

  We got coffees right away and handed English Menus.

 I ordered the 2 eggs over easy with Sausage, and English Muffin instead of the Bread.  The Eggs were soo delicious and the Sausage tasted soo fresh I was happy the Man who took our order told me they were Fresh Beef Sausage.

  The Home Fries come with the dish as does the coffee, and they garnish the plate with catalope slice and an orange wedge.

 My Fiance ordered the Egg White Omelet and came with the same garnish, and Home Fries, choice of Toast, and Coffee. He ordered Oatmeal as well and was asked if he would like the choice of Milk or Water Oatmeal. Yes Options are cool.

 Best Breakfast Ive had in Quebec so far and noticed a line forming outside as we were leaving, so I guess other locals know about this Gem.

 I will Def be back and try more of the Menu!"}
{"text":"Oeufs bénédictines excellents. Grosse portion de friits frais. Jus d'orange bizarre : un genre de mix de jus tropicana avec un autre jus cheap selon la serveuse. Service bon mais peut risquer d'être très long si achanladage (45 minutes avant de commander). Gestion du personnel bizarre: pleins de filles pour remplir ton café mais 2 serveurs dans tout le resto pour prendre la commande."}
{"text":"Breakfast was absolutely amazing and the staff was great even though there was a language barrier."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant. I go all the time when I'm in the area. The food is consistently good. Never a surprise or a disappointment. You might have to wait a few minutes, but that's a good sign. The owner is a very sympathetic guy who's always nice! 

Give it a try. Just please... Not when I go. I hate lines;)"}
{"text":"Was travelling through Quebec and was looking for a great breakfast spot close to where we were on the highway. This restaurant popped up and after a brief glance of the reviews and pictures on Yelp we thought we give it a try. 

Cute place that was easy to find and had free parking. Greeted pleasantly at the front and we sat ourselves at an open table. 

Customer service wise, this place has room for improvement. 

It took a while for them to take our drink orders (coffee & tea) and wasn't offered a refill until our meal was finished. 

Ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon. It was served with a fruit medley and home style potatoes. 

The potatoes were excellent in texture, warmth and freshness. They were define it made to order. 

The fruit portion of the meal was amazing. Fresh kiwi, green apple, red apple, honey dew melon, cantaloupe, red grapes, orange, watermelon, pineapple, grapefruit -'d strawberries. Like seriously!!!

The eggs were fantastic as well. Perfectly cooked with right amount of sauce. 

All in all a great food experience."}
{"text":"I have been is St-Sauveur for 15 yrs. This resto was excellent years ago. However, recently, the last two times I ate there, I felt ignored and taken for granted. The food is standard. However, there are many other places that are better."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, le cafe est excellent. J'ai pris deux oeufs, bacons et c'etais tres bon. Par contre, les patates etaient dégoulinantes d'huiles et n'etaient pas tres appetissantes. 

Ca n'enleve rien a l'experience et j'ai bien apprecié mon dejeuner. 

Interac ne fonctionnait pas (manquait de papier) mais par chance j'avais un peu d'argents."}
{"text":"Breakfast in the morning... Okay I have to say the portion of the food are BIG!! I had the american style breakfast, nothing to special about that, my friends got duck meat she said it was good. Overall 3 persons comes out total of 55$... It was a bit toooooo pricy"}
{"text":"Terrific. So many options, generous servings, clean. Standout was the fruit that came with each meal---half of the plate piled with creatively cut up, fresh fruit. Most meals came with coffee. Clean, modern bathroom."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and genuine. Even with me not speaking much French the servers were very friendly which isn't always the case in Quebec. That's essentially why it's got a 4 star rating from me. The food was good but nothing spectacular and on the pricey side. More along the lines of Cora's or higher than your local breakfast spot but this is in a tourist area so it's to be expected. The menu has a lot of options and something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, clean bathrooms. Get the benedict or the poutine.

Located in the heart of saint sauveur."}
{"text":"Quick and fast!
The good: easy to get there. Can find your basic comfort breakfast meals. Presentation like Chez Cora but less pricey. Excellent service even when busy! Nestled at the heart on the main road of St Sauver downtown
The bad: during weekends can walk in without a problem before 10am after long line-phone due to its popularity. Small space so you can easily hear your neighbor's conversation.
The ugly: Yup when you're late you will wait sigh...
Tip: if you get in early you can park at front. Good bang for your dollar $-$$"}
{"text":"Great spot in Saint-Sauveur, portions are big with option for 1/2 portions for those with a smaller appetite, Kids menu is also pretty good, over all prices are reasonable but not cheap. I personally would recommend the Breakfast Poutine or the fricassee du Ben. But there were so many other interesting options on the menu as well it was hard to choose."}
