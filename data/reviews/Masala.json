{"text":"Im a bit of a Indian food snob. I don't usually like Indian food in restaurants, but I absolutely love the food here. Be sure to try the aloo paratha! Food is appropriately priced, the staff is really friendly, and the ambiance is fantastic.  They're also on uber Eats, close to the strip, and open 24/7!"}
{"text":"I ordered for a non-veg thali to-go, was given a veg thali. Food is below average - chicken tikka masala was filled with oil. Paneer curry had no paneer in it. All curries taste sweet. Pricey too..Waste of money.."}
{"text":"This place is a restaurant by day and a cooking school by night.   I tried the butter chicken, an old classic, with naan and a lentil soup. Everything was well prepared and the naan was very fresh. I wish the soup was a bit bigger though.   Decor and music were quite nice and homey... something that is often lacking in other indian places.   Surprisingly for an indian restaurant the waitress was Dutch (!). She was really friendly and attentive so good marks for service."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food ever. I visited here because I was craving for dosa and this place was close to my hotel. All people working here were young boys and an elderly uncle , seems he was probably the owner. We ordered pav bhaji, dosa and uttapam. The guy who took our order made all 3 things I ordered right after taking my order. ( I didn't  even see him sanitizing or washing his hands after touching the register). People were coming in while he was making my order and he was doing both simultaneously.   The Bhaji was obliviously pre made which he burnt it on the pan and the pav was sweet which was burnt too. It just tasted equally bad as it looked. The dosa was just horrible and coconut chutney was bad. Uttapam didn't look like one.   Moving on the price was not at all worth it. All 3 items cost me $30 in total.  Tip from me is to go to mint Indian bistro if you are in Vegas and craving for Indian food. Only thing is they close at 11:30pm versus these one which  is 24/7. But so not worth it."}
{"text":"Decent and light Indian meal. It's at one end of the strip a quieter place as compared to the actual strip. It's a small restaurant and crowded at peak hours so plan your visit accordingly."}
{"text":"Me and my went here for a lunch during Thanksgiving break. Sambar was delicious and it had lot veggies in it. The only thing is that idli could have been soft, it was really hard. We got Uthappam which was really good and well cooked. The food was priced equal to Bay area restaurants which i felt was little costly. Overall the food quality was decent. Would recommend to others.  One request to hotel management is that, please make sure the desks are cleaned properly before the next customer sits on the table."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service  .. non oily, healthy and delicious !!! A rare Indian restaurant of its class !! Keep it up guys !!"}
{"text":"Incredible food! This restaurant has the best Indian food in town. What sets this particular restaurant apart is the ambiance. Very modern and creative interior design. Me and my family had a terrific experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto (tons of Indian restos) and ate at many Indian restaurants I rank this resturant easily in my top 3. Simple menu served with rice and lentils which was out of this world."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to this place on the strip. They just opened up yesterday and has a great vibe. The interior was fun with cool artwork. I ordered some pani  poori, butter chicken with rice and a masala dosa. The food was delicious and something I'll definitely be coming back for. The service was also great. So overall amazing"}
{"text":"The place is buzzing with people when visited late afternoon. The food is tasty and had decent portion sizes for the price. The management is friendly. It would have been better if the tables were cleaned after every customer. Small place, not an expensive menu, tasty food, 24/7 - really worth another visit."}
{"text":"The old location at the Rivera was my favorite Indian resturant in vegas. I was blown away by there new location and flavors"}
{"text":"Finally good, well priced South Indian food on Las Vegas Strip. Refreshing decor and menu. Love the fact they are open 24 hours. :)"}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast, and had dosa and vada which my parents liked it, I'm happy for that."}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever visited  Worst Indian food  Don't know why people are crowded for this worst food"}
{"text":"Food was OK. But they served Frozen Parantha by making them hot. Small little place and service is fast but avoid if you dont want to eat Frozen food"}
{"text":"Really good home cooking. Took the cooking class and really enjoyed it. The hours seem a little funny sometimes but worth going for it!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food. The chai is simply amazing. We ordered Veg thali, it was yummilicious."}
{"text":"Awesome South Indian/ North Indian Food(Dosa/Uthappam/Chole Batura/Biryanis). Little crowded over holidays. Good for take outs. We first ordered here in Uber and then visited this place on 3/5 day stay in vagas."}
{"text":"Very bad food. Quality of food, curry, Naan and especially paneer was yukky.. worst restaurant ever"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! Went super late at night and couple of drunk guys just going crazy. The employees had no control. The food was even horrible. Got pav bhaji, goat curry and butter chicken. Butter chicken was somewhat okay. Only thing this place has going for itself is its open 24/7."}
{"text":"Decent food. We tried the South Indian menu. Coconut chutney was really good. Dosa was good. Sambar was ok. Best advantage was that is place is open 24/7"}
{"text":"The worst chicken biriyani we had. We ordered 3 biriyanis to go and after reaching our hotel found the food had a smoky flavour and found burnt chicken pieces in it."}
{"text":"One of the best place to have indian food in Vegas...parathe, chhole bhature are really good.."}
{"text":"This place is a blessing in the middle of Vegas strip. Open 24/7. Cheap. With yummy food. We got the paneer curry and chicken curry. They both came with rice and naan. Aloo parantha was super spicy but really delicious."}
{"text":"Worst food never had a experience where Dosa & sambar  went wrong.i happen to see the chef tasting with hand and putting the same hand on the pan very untidy i will never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Masala Restaurant:  Located on the Las Vegas Strip next to Ross and less then a block from the Circus Circus Casino is in one word (((AWESOME))) !!!  This hole in the wall serves awesome Indian Cuisine at a very affordable price compared to all the over-priced eateries on the Las Vegas Strip.  Masala is now my favorite place to eat while staying on the LAS Strip.  NOTE:  If you are looking for affordable VEGAN dinning options without paying the high prices in the luxury casino/resorts... then Masala is a great place for an awesome meal!!!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate street food experience. The food is piping hot, the joint bustling and the taste is fantastic. Steer clear of all South Indian options though; The vegetable biryani and Thali are fantastic !!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it!  1. Amazing hours (24!) & great location. 2. The most modern, hip Indian restaurant I've ever been to. The art is downright fun. 3. The menu has vegan items marked, so there's no guesswork. 4. Turnaround time was super quick.  We tried the chana masala (5/5), which comes with both roti & rice (they call this kind \"jeera rice\" - extra long basmati speckled with whole cumin seeds, yum) which you always have to order separately elsewhere. We loved this!    The golden dal was just okay. (Maybe a 3.7/5?) I don't have a strong opinion on it. I would have some if someone else ordered, but it wouldn't be my first choice.  We also had the veggie samosas (7/5, lol), and they were the biggest, freshest tasting ones ever. They are huge!! The sauces were both vegan (no yogurt) & yummy. Can we just get 50 of these?  I do have one bone to pick, and that is the roti. It did not seem fresh at all, it kinda pissed me off. I am used to tandoor-charred goodness, but these tasted packaged.   All in all, we totally will be back. I want to try their aloo gobi (cauliflower/potato) & onion bhaji (fried onion balls) next!"}
{"text":"Always looking for authentic Indian cuisine and this place did not disappoint.  The portion sizes were large and the food was made with quality ingredients.  I would recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Briyani."}
{"text":"This is a nice small place owned by Punjabi family. We visited this place twice and both times it was too crowded. The food is good here especially the south indian food however they do not know how to manage the crowds. I am also taking away one star because their parantha and naan was frozen. Plus there were huge waiting time ( about 30 min) for each order. Overall if you are out of options on the strip, you can give it a try."}
{"text":"Good food and good customer service. Very pricey for me though. I ordered the non-vegetarian thali combo plate.  Total was $16 and some change for the one plate of food. All the stars goes to the taste of the food and the fact that it is a 24/7 place. So i guess I'll be back if I want Indian curry at 730am again."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Reasonably priced. The pao bhaji was out of this world! The coconut chutney was stale the first day and we told them. They promised to fix it and when we came back the next day, it was fresh!"}
{"text":"It's too worst restaurant, they don't even know what food items they are making. Chicken Biryani, I never have such kind of biryani, it's not biryani, chicken pieces are dry and hard, rice was not good, funny and  one of the worst part was they add lemon pickle on top of it."}
{"text":"This is a small joint at the end of the strip. It tries to represent overall Indian cuisine. If you are familiar with real Indian food, you can skip this place.   My experience was average. Food was bland. If you have walked the strip and are particular about Indian food ( not taste) - you can consider."}
{"text":"I loveeeee their chicken tikka masala!! The rice was so fragrant and tasty, the sauce was so yummy to eat by itself or dipped with the naan. The place is very modern and cozy, also very clean. The workers were funny and friendly, so that's always a plus. I also got the masala dosa which was a vegetarian type wrap, somewhat like a burrito and the size was huge. They are definitely generous with their portions! I would recommend this place to anyone & definitely come back here! And it's open 24 hours!!"}
{"text":"Who knew that delicious food in Vegas could actually be this inexpensive!! The Tiki Masala was even better than their curry. Loved it so much!!"}
{"text":"Was pretty good and walking distance from Trump Hotel, ordered the Chicken Masala, just wished the rice portion was a little bit bigger. Great taste and open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Indian food. Not pricey budget friendly. They are open 24 hours and they make fresh authentic Indian food. We tried dosas, paranthas, cholay bhatura and took take out food for our canyon trip- chicken biryani, paranthas and pakoras. Yummy food. Must try, walkable on the strip!!!"}
{"text":"Tried couple of times, taste and quality was above expectations!! Service is fast as well. Harpreet and team is friendly!! Good is they are open 24/7!!"}
{"text":"Food is really average. The place is cramped. The cashier made us wait for 15 minutes just because he wanted to close out for the hour. Stay away!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant in Pointe St Charles with a foodie group on a night where the restaurant offers cooking classes, and we had a blast! It's a bring your own wine restaurant with very little in terms of decor and an open kitchen in the back. Although some members participated in the actual preparation of the dishes, the chef demonstrated the making of chicken masala, cardamom rice, masoor dal, and eggplant bhurta, while we enjoyed our glasses of wine. The chef was engaging and funny, and we learned much about Indian cuisine, the use of spice and the variation of cuisine across north and south. At the end, we shared the prepared meal which was plentiful and delicious! We also left with a printout of all the recipes so I'll definitely be preparing these dishes at home, especially the bhurta which was so simple and delicious. As I didn't actually have a sit down meal at this spot, I'm going with four stars based on seeing the love put into the preparation of the meal from the experienced chef, and the tasty results!"}
{"text":"We visited the above said Indian Restaurant, food and the service was good.But I request the owner of the restaurant to please change the glass under the billing station because the same has our God's pictures which we don't think they should be at such lower place."}
{"text":"If u have nothing to eat  in Vegas , den only u can go to dis place ..!!! Highly disappointed with the food quality..!!!  I don't recommend dis place ..!!! Not worthy!!!"}
{"text":"Went with family and friend. Great Food. Good quality and Quantity. Liked the music outside the restaurant that gave me the feel of being in India:-)"}
{"text":"Ordered biryani and got pulao and quantity was also insufficient for what we pay ..!! Taste like it was made day before and reheated and served ..!!"}
{"text":"Un peu cher pour un repas du midi. Les classiques sont absent. L'ambiance est intime."}
{"text":"Awesome quality and tasty Indian food. Didn't feel like we were outside delhi. Dal makhani and chole were very authentic as were the dosa and chai. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Finding a vegan friendly spot that's open after 2am is quite difficult, even in vegas so I am absolutely ecstatic that this place opened up! I have only been here once, and I ordered the vegan chana masala. I love that the cashier notified me that although the vegan masala comes with naan, the naan is not vegan. It is great to see restaurants that are knowledgeable on various diets and restrictions. Although it was after 2am when I visited, I was completely sober so I can say with the utmost confidence that my meal was delicious! I was with 5 other friends, and they all enjoyed their food as well. All of our food was reasonably priced and well portioned. I cannot wait to come back and try the rest of their vegan options. One note: Please please make a vegan mango lassi available! Ok, another note: The restaurant had \"Sohn Munda\" by Sunidhi Chauhan on repeat (yes, we Shazam'd it)...so maybe have more than one song playing? lol"}
{"text":"So I just found my new favourite Indian restaurant in Montreal. It's right down the street from me, which means I'd eat here even if it weren't delicious, but holy smokes... this place is incredible!   The menu is simple, with maybe a dozen or so items, each bursting with flavour. Each is also served as an individual plate, with a main dish, rice and daal. Not knowing this, we ordered the Palak Paneer, the Giant Shrimp Masala and the Butter Chicken for two people. Add 4 papadums (some of the best I've ever tasted), and needless to say, neither of us is hungry.   I won't go into detail about the food. All you need to know is that the portions are generous, it tastes incredible and is made with love."}
{"text":"We ordered Dosa,aloo paratha and Paneer paratha for breakfast.. it took sometime to come. The dosa was okay but parthas was frozen parathas heated and given not freshly cooked. Waiting time was more and staff was not that friendly. Masala Tea was decent.All n all average don't set expectations high."}
{"text":"Good Indian food On busy LV strip (slightly north) and apparently open 24/7. Tried one veg and one non-veg thali. Food tasted good, service was prompt, nice no frill casual ambience. Offer cuisines from different parts of India. Place and restroom were clean."}
{"text":"Bad bad service! Never buy Paratha, it's frozen paratha defrosted  vada I think was made last week and the chole lacked Masala!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and reasonably priced!   Probably one of the best butter chicken, samosa and naan I've had in a long time.  Nice alternative on the strip to hotel buffets and over priced restaurants."}
{"text":"So glad to find this Indian place on the strip.  Nice to have some normal healthy wholesome food at a reasonable price instead of all the overpriced bland diners, fast food, and chain places in most hotels.  We tried masala dosa and uttapam and both were pretty good."}
{"text":"I typically like to eat Indian food when I am travelling and it's usually easy to make a determination on the quality of the food. When  we walked into Masala, we were pleasantly surprised about the wall decor with filmy dialogues and Indian memes. We were a group of 11 and ordered Chole Bathura, Paranthas (Aloo & Paneer), Goat curry combo and a Masala Dosa.  Apart from the dosa, everything else tasted like amazing home cooked meals. The icing on the cake was the masala tea afterwards."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. While the menu is simple and less extensive than most Indian spots, their food is more authentic (and delicious w/ a wonderful use of spices) as well. I believe it is only open for lunch. Interestingly, they offer cooking classes during some evenings. I'm hoping to try that as well someday!"}
{"text":"I really don't know why all the great reviews. This place really disappoints. I'll cut right to it. We ordered a lentil soup each. They had put so much cumin in it that my tongue was numb. The papadum wasn't like the ones I'm used to. I could taste the old oil. The samosas... oh two TINY (one bite each) for 3$. At any other restaurants i would of gotten two regular size (tennis ball size) that we are all accustomed to for 3,50$! The naan bread is literally store bought. And our main you ask? I took two bites of my lamb saag and was ready to leave. It came with rice and dal that was super bland. I sorry but I really did want to like this place. I'll guess next time I'll just have to go back to the \"sure value \" restaurants. Service could also be more polished. They offer cooking classes as well. I don't think I'll be taking them."}
{"text":"Super greasy chicken tikka masala. Gave us both a stomach ache, do not recommend. We always have Indian food, and the exact same dish everywhere we go. This was not a good experience"}
{"text":"This place is so good and convenient it's open late. We were passing by and stopped to eat here. Got the chicken tikki Marsala and some roti. I've been to india before so I really love Indian food. The place was hip on the inside."}
