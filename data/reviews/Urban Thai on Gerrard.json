{"text":"Poor quality, disappointment Mango salad had zero fish sauce, and I think zero lime juice as well. They used cashews instead of peanuts, which wasn't bad. Sweet pineapple rice was ridiculously sweet  This is below average Thai food, would not recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Ordered a phad thai with a spring roll on the side. I could only eat a quarter of the meal. It was pretty bad. Too much sauce so the noodles felt gloopy. Too sour and not enough balance with sweet and salty. Chicken didn't taste fresh. No smokiness from the wok, essentail for good phad thai. I was the only one in the restaurant. Probably a good reason why."}
{"text":"Well, the food was 1 hour late, for a total delivery time of 2 hours. Allergens which were specified to be unincluded in a dish where they were easily avoidable, we're ignored. Hairs were found in the samosas, and the initial temperature of Curry dishes we received at 113 degrees Fahrenheit, as specified in the photos. Avoid at all costs literally, anywhere else in Toronto will provide better food quality, and will not hang up on you if you call to complain."}
