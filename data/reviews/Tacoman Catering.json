{"text":"I went to an event where this guy was catering.  Food was standard food-truck cheap tacos on stale, store-bought tortillas.  Of course I got sick the next day really bad as did my wife and kids.  I didn't see any sort of Health Department card at his stand.  Not sure if he's licensed or not.  Never again, Taco Man.  Never again."}
{"text":"We've booked The Taco Man for our church events several times and love them! It was very simple to book a reservation and Omar is easy to work with. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. The flavors are so delicious and everything is fresh!!! I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"We have used the taco man twice for our parties and they are amazing. I can not recommend them more. Professional, on time, and the food is delicious. The best and most impressive deal in town!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I never write reviews. This special occasion called for one.

I arranged for Omar to cater a rehearsal dinner for out of town guests for my cousins wedding. I confirmed my appointment with Omar via the telephone and email. The day of the rehearsal dinner Omar was supposed to show up at 1pm to start setting up and cook. By 2pm he was no where to be found. I looked at the reviews here on Yelp and most of the complaints were that he wasn't timely so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. By 3pm Omar still had not arrived. I called Omar and when he answered he had no idea that he even had an event that day. He completely forgot! My family and I had to run to Costco and cook for 50 people in a moments notice. I tried to call him back to maybe see if he could still cook something but he never answers my calls. He purposely avoided all of my calls. Needless to say, Omar is unreliable. I will never use him and do not recommend him for anyone's catering needs."}
{"text":"This was the worse experience ever.  The man was over 2 hours late for delivery at our daughters graduation party.  We ordered $400 worth of food and what he delivered was not even $100 worth of food.  The food looked like it came from another party and he forgot the tortillas!  What kind of Taco Man shows up without tortillas? He did not even apologize for being late. The salsa was not freshly made, the beans looked old, chips were from a bag.  When he left to go to buy some tortillas we called him and asked him to come back and pick up his food and he never even came back.  In the end we got the food for free but we couldn't eat it because we didn't know if/when he was going to come back or how old the food really was.  Will never use this company again."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Omar was awesome. Arrived on time, everyone raved about the pork tacos and we had plenty left over, will definitely be booking him for any further events that we have."}
{"text":"We used The Taco Man for a holiday event and it was AWESOME!  Took so much stress off the host and hostess as they do everything for the meal.  And it was great food - extremely flavorful and good meat choices.  They understand the importance of a good sauce to add to each individual's preference of spiciness.  

The one bad thing was their tortilla chips.  I wanted a bit more fresh/homemade style tortilla chip and the ones they brought looked and tasted like store bought blandness.  :(  Tacos make up for it though.  They set up and cleaned up everything!  Would definitely use them again."}
{"text":"The Taco Man was hired on short notice to be our food vendor at a youth racing event in Las Vegas. Omar was willing and able to get the additional permits required by the venue. He and his staff showed up on time and did a phenomenal job over the 4 day event. We had a huge crowd, and they were a bit overwhelmed the first day I think, but they buckled down and provided a simple, but very tasty menu that was enjoyed by all. Huge thanks to Omar and his crew,  I highly recommend them for any event, big or small."}
{"text":"We've had the pleasure of working with the taco man on two separate occasions. One was for a 60 person reunion and the other was for a 100+ person  reception. Easy to work with, affordable, and everyone raved about the tacos (made fresh to order). As the organizer, I didn't have to worry about the details as they brought everything needed including tables, napkins, silverware, and all the yummy fixings! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Taco man is awesome. He does it all. Makes the party easy so you can enjoy your company and not worry about cooking and cleaning. 2nd time I've used tacoman and will do again. Thanks tacoman!!!!"}
{"text":"Well.... I have had some lengthy discussions with Omar the owner... and we seemed to have worked things out.  Like I said in my original review.. things can't always be perfect and we all have bad days. Omar apologized for being late.  He said that because he added the corn to the menu that he typically did not do, he underestimated the time it would take to cook which caused his schedule to be off. The corn was very good. In the end... he did show up... he did bring what he said he would.  The tacos were very tasty..."}
{"text":"I hired them for a work event I did for my residents and they were awesome! Prompt and very nice. The food was great and everyone enjoyed it. Thank you for providing great food for our event! I will definitely be recommending them to some of our other communities around Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Tacoman and his team are the best!  We loved their food, and they did such a great job on our Engagement party!  There team was prompt, courteous, and all of our guests were very happy!  The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food and the service they provide.  I would absolutely recommend them to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"The Taco Man was recommended to me by a friend. We had a company luncheon that the taco man catered for approx. 50 people. He was there on time as promised and was serving our people with what had to be the most delicious tacos and fixings. Everyone was extremely pleased and full! I would definitely call on the Taco Man again and again. The price was right too  Thanks Omar"}
{"text":"Had a great party with their catering.  Everyone loved the food.  They were on time and kept in communication before and during the party.  I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Tacoman Catering is awesome for any kind of event or party you are having! They are very professional & the food is fresh & delicious!!! I had reserved them 2 days before the 4th of July & they squeezed me in. I recommend them for your next fiesta!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience with The Taco Man during a double retirement party.  I was not impressed nor was my husband and other attendees.  

It was edible but wouldn't go as far to say that any of it was good. Meat was dry, could have had more flavor and the rice didn't seem to be an authentic Mexican rice. (maybe instant? idk)"}
{"text":"Needed food for 40 people on a film set here in Vegas. Taco man came and was able to feed everyone with food leftover. He set up quickly and the food was awesome. Can't still believe how cheap it was. Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Omar was wonderful to work with! I had less than 24 hours and needed to cater my party of 25. Omar arrived with EVERYTHING. From Guacamole, salsa, meats, tortillas, Chafing containers, serving utensils to stereo! I literally put a table in my kitchen. Her arrived (on time) set everything up and viola it was plenty of food, and my guests loved it!! Excellent! If you want awesome food, confidence in a company and a great service, Omar is your man. 
Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"The Taco Man was recommended to us by a friend. They served authentic fabulous tasting  mexican food with moist flavourful meats. The food the service and the staff were just \"Great\" they showed up, set up, served requested food to guests when required and best of all, they cleaned up before leaving!
Omar and his staff were a delight to work with when it came to catering for my Birthday Party. 
\"Everyone loved the food and service, awesome evening party experience, would most definitely hire again!\""}
{"text":"Despite the positive reviews on Yelp, we had a bad experience with the Taco Man.  Omar confirmed our reservation for our holiday party via email - but when we called him the day of our event - he did not remember our reservation and ultimately stated that he would be there for our party that night.  Unfortunately...he did not show up for our party and instead sent an email that he could not get into our gate.  If they had all of our food prepared and with them, why would they leave and go back home?  Something was not right.  We tried to email, text and call him multiple times but were unable to get in touch with him.  We were left hanging with no food and a party of 30 people.  Thank god for Domino's pizza and 30 minute delivery."}
{"text":"Booked them for our sons 4th birthday and loved them! Showed up on time, great setup, and courteous. Guests were talking about the tacos for days. We will definitely be booking them for future events! Thanks for making it an awesome birthday!"}
{"text":"Omar and his staff are great! We had them for a birthday party. They were on time and professional and the food was outstanding. The kids and adults All loved it. We would definitely use him again and recommend him."}
{"text":"We had a celebration of life party on mother's day and the Tacoman was outstanding!  Omar was very easy to work with and Julio was our amazing party chef.  Everyone LOVED the tacos and they even brought veggies to grill for the vegetarians in our group.  We highly recommend  Tacoman and will be using them again when we have our Mexican themed holiday party!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to 4 parties where the Taco Man has served his food.They are always professional, friendly,food quality is fantastic, arrive on time, set their thins up and deliver a wonderful variety of food with a flavor that is hard to forget. I cannot say enough about them and highly recommend them to all"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Delicious. Polite. Showed up in time. Served all our guests. Was a big hit. Great guys. They set up quick and inna breeze. Asked for a last call, then packed up neatly and said goodbye. Great for any sort of backyard party! I would definitely book them again."}
{"text":"The Taco Man Catered our Halloween Party and all our guests raved how great the tacos were!! We opted for the \"Fresh Tortillas\" made on site by the Tortilla Lady, they were amazing! I'd highly recommend adding her! Omar's  staff was very friendly and professional, arrived on time and handled everything. We were very satisfied with the service and pricing. We will definitely use The Taco Man again : )"}
{"text":"The Taco Man catered our \"Day After Wedding Lunch\" at a public park and it was hit. The food was delicious, everyone loved it. We had carne asada, curry chicken, and pork tacos. Plus all the toppings. They did a great job, and not that expensive to cater a party of 100 people."}
{"text":"We had a party of  30 people my husband called to confirm. And the day of they called to say they were going to be about an hour hour-and-a-half late. I pleaded with her and told her that you didn't give me another option and that you were our only choice. If you would have given me a heads-up I could have planned something else! Its superbowl sunday!  Instead they left us stranded so we told them we'd see them at 5 5:30. Then come to find out they never showed up when my husband tried to reach out and talk to the lady again she said call the owner when we called the owner it went straight to voicemail or send us a text message saying text me I can't get to my phone. We tried that into is an auto-response. He never called never showed up no response from the owner and the worst part is we use them previously. Stay away take your money someplace else thank God for Pepes tacos they save the day ! Horrible they dont deserve any stars! This business should be shut down!"}
{"text":"We definitely recommend taco man: delicious food, perfect and professional, on-time!!!! This was truly a great choice for our daughter's birthday party. Our guests loved it, everyone was content! Thank you so much Omar for your wonderful service! I recommend this company to whomever wants a great outcome,  and believe me, I'm very picky but Omar is AWESOME and made our party an unforgettable one!!!! Thanks sooo much!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  He didn't show up for our first appointment, and didn't respond to my messages to confirm or cancel.  I think it was meant to be, as I found a better and more reliable taco caterer.  Glad this didn't happen the day of my event, as I see some others had this bad experience of his no show for their event.   Terrible way to run a business!!"}
{"text":"Take your business elsewhere for sure. I booked him months before my event and called to confirm the details just before my event. He showed up extremely late so the food wasn't ready until an hour after the time we agreed on. When he finally showed up he was acted like it was no big deal that he was 40 minutes late because he had some issue with the rice and beans (which were clearly straight out of a can). I had also emailed back and forth with the owner to verify he would serve a specific type of pork taco with pineapple. I even offered to pay more to be sure that it would be served. He assured me that he would be serving it and it would be no problem. He served some type of nasty ground pork that was nothing close to what we had discussed. Keep searching party hosts because this is definitely not the caterer you want for your event."}
{"text":"I have had their food at numerous catered lunches at work and the food is amazing! They always have a great selection, very fresh, and perfectly cooked. They are professional and friendly. I have just booked a private party with them and I am excited and hope our guests will love their food as much as I do."}
{"text":"The Tacoman catered a party of 30 for us and the food was great! I had no problem communicating with them every time I called. Everyone was raving about the tacos! Jessica set up quickly, was very attentive and left our yard clean. We would definitely have The Tacoman cater again!"}
{"text":"I've heard his tacos are great, but I wouldn't know because The taco man didn't show up to my event on 6/16/16. I have evidence of our agreement  in an email as well as in a text message. My father in law passed away and we were holding a memorial service. I thought hiring the Taco Man would be a great idea, but I guess he had better things to do. He was supposed to be at our house at 3:30 to set up (the service started at 4pm). He never showed .
I gave him until 3:45pm (assuming he was running late) and at that point I started texting and calling him either the number he provided me with as well as the store number and I was completely ignored. I was unable to get someone on the line. 
I would have at least appreciated a call or a text message saying he was unable to make it if that was the case... But I didn't get anything. At 4:27pm,after the taco man ignored several calls and texts from me, I gave up trying. 
I ordered pizza and Pizza Hut came through for our event, but it would have been nice if the Taco man would have been there Instead like he previously agreed.

I've posted the picture of our text message conversation under photos to show I am being truthful about the situation."}
{"text":"Never eaten here before, but glad I tried it. Fast service and really good food. I hope I can do it again soon. Pretty cool place."}
{"text":"If I could give him zero stars I would. He catered an event and ran out of food before everyone ate. I will say that the food was tasty however it was nothing special. But the fact that he made a commitment and did not meet it says loads. I will never recommend this guy."}
{"text":"The Taco Man is yummy, fresh Mexican food.  I highly recommend!!  They showed up on time, set up very professionally and made our vow renewal party yummy!  Omar and the tortilla lady (I highly recommend you spring for the tortilla lady) were great.  Both very engaging and personable.  The food was fresh, tortillas were made right there, the presentation was perfect and everything was clean.  Try them- you wont be sorry.  Loved it and will definitely use them again!"}
{"text":"Hired him to do my son's graduation. Very nice over the phone and asked me what I needed. Day of the graduation his workers came in asked where they could set up within 29 minutes they were cooking. Great food, cooks were very nice, and plenty of food left over. Will definitely hire the Taco Man for my next party. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We booked this people to handle our company party yesterday and it was a DISASTER! We had people doing our taco catering before and the service is always good with tons of meat left over and a little bit of everything to take home but nfortunately they were all booked for yesterday event. We had no other choice to hire this guy...HUGE MISTAKE! I'll explain with detail how this awful taco thing went. Some random guy on a really bet up van showed up into my office with all the food \"uncover\" on the back of this filthy van starting unloading the food and when we looked  closely into what he brought were all frozen meats that were possible left overs from previous events. We paid 550.00 to feed 60 people but they only brought food for 30 people making ourselves looking really bad and  some of our customers that they showed up to our party couldnt eat due to the amount they brought. The taco guy say that they always cook the meats fresh but those frozen meats we're far from fresh. The unprofessional guy that was frying the meat (not freshly cooking...frying) was very rude when I asked him to make sure to warm up my tortillas nicely and he looked at me bothered by my  request and start shaking he's head so I asked him what was the issue and that if he had a problem we were going to call he's boss to send someone else more professional and he said that he didn't care that we can call him if we like. I wouldn't recomend this guy to anybody regardless of some of the few ok comments posted here. We will be requesting a refund!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! We had steak and chicken tacos and both were phenomenal! I absolutely loved the salsa... Very flavorful with enough of a kick to make your lips tingle but not so spicy it was overkill. The steak was tender and delicious and the chicken was very tasty as well.

We will absolutely plan on using Omar again in the future!"}
{"text":"Attended a Party with this Service and was well impressed by the fish Food and the great Service !"}
{"text":"Omar was wonderful.  He was very professional and dressed like a caterer to the event.  We had Asada, chicken and al Pastor.  The meats were very flavorful and not dry.  He had a great display table with the condiments (onions, cilantro, homemade salsa, cheese, beans and rice).  He was very courteous and worked hard on the grill.  The food was great and the leftovers were given to us to eat at our leisure after the 3 hours was up.  I would highly recommend Omar.  He was very reliable and really nice.  We will be sure to use him again for our future events."}
{"text":"These guys catered a wedding I attended, and all of the food was hot, very fresh, and delicious. Guac, salsas, sides all super tasty, and the beef, pork and chicken were all well seasoned. Very efficient setup and personable staff. There were no issues with timeliness or quantities."}
{"text":"We have used Tacoman on several occasions.  They always arrive on time, provide great service and quality food at an affordable price.  They respond quickly to email and phones are traditionally answered each time I have called by someone who speaks fluent english.  If you are looking for in home catering this is a great easy option.  Thanks Tacoman!"}
{"text":"I requested a quote for my birthday party over two weeks ago. No response at all. That's just rude and unprofessional.

After receiving a response to my Yelp review on 9/11, I went back to their website to see if it is possible that I made a mistake in entering my information.  I have Chrome autofill, so unfortunately, that's not what happened."}
{"text":"One star is a gift for these guys!  Literally blew off the party, didn't answer the phone and then finally after repeated phone calls they answered and had a lame excuse.  We still asked if they could please come late... we had a house full of hungry people.... they said nope.  DO NOT BOOK THESE PEOPLE... if you do, make sure you have Dominos number handy!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is our favorite so we had to have tacos for our wedding. We looked up Omar months in advance, set up a time to meet, and made the reservation. 

Fast forward to two weeks before the wedding when I get a final numbers count and send these details to Omar. He emailed me back stating that he did not have a reservation for me. After emailing back and forth for a couple of days and sending him a copy of the reservation and deposit, he agreed to continue to cater our wedding. I did pretty much have a panic attack over it though. 

Then the actually wedding day. We had agreed that food would served at 3:15. At 3:15, our caterer is nowhere in sight. I called Omar and he let me know that they were on their way. Again, a little bit of a heart attack that got better once they showed up. Our hungry guests just drank and danced until he showed up and pounced on those tacos. The man that served the tacos was very sweet and everyone reported that they enjoyed the food very much. My husband and I both did not eat anything because we got so busy, so we rely upon our guests feedback. 

So besides being an hour late and the snafu with the reservation, it is a good choice. The food is decent and the price is amazing."}
{"text":"I attended a birthday party that was catered by him, we were all so impressed! The salsas and sides were so fresh and so many options! Love this guy! We will be hiring him for our next event."}
{"text":"When your having a party and want it catered look no further. Omar is awesome and the food selection is on point unbelievable and great price!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Worst taco man ever!. We hired them for a wedding and told them we were going to have between 80 and 100 people but on the safe side we told them to make sure there is enough for 125 people so we can have left overs and people can have seconds. First of all they did overcharge us and also said they would be there for two hours and were only there for one hour and ran out of food when there was only 85 people at the wedding and everyone didn't get to eat. The food was not that great either compare to other taco man's that we hired in the past. Very unprofessional and not worth the price for the quantity and quality of food."}
{"text":"I never heard of The Taco Man until I was at a fabulous Cinco De Mayo party on Sunday which was catered by The Taco Man!  This is essentially interactive catering - the menu is on the web site.  You choose your meats, sides, and tortilla type and The Taco Man brings all of the goods and grills out at your place!!  Our host had chicken asada, carne asada, and that other meat I don't eat (but people really liked it!)  I was gluttonous and started with 3 tacos and ended up eating 2 more later.

The corn tortillas were warmed on the grill and piled high with beef and chicken at my request.  Toppings in separate bowls on the table included shredded lettuce, shredded taco cheese, diced sweet onion, cilantro, spicy tomatillo salsa in a squirt bottle, and medium red salsa.  I covered my tacos with everything.  The flavor was phenomenal - so much flavor packed in the little tacos, and they were delicious!  I liked both meats and all of the toppings.  I really enjoyed how sweet the onions were!

This was a really great idea for an outdoor shindig.  I highly recommend checking out The Taco Man to cater your next event!"}
{"text":"They recently catered my son's engagement party and it was a huge success.  Arrived on time, gracious and attentive servers, great food, plenty of everything and very professional.  Thank you so much for making it the perfect event!"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, we hired the Taco Man as our caterer for my fiancé's birthday party and we loved them! The tacos were great and the service was even better. It's so nice to not have to worry about setting anything up or providing anything. They bring all of their own equipment and even plates and utensils. They were so professional and so accommodating. I find them also the most affordable compared to other taco caterers. This year, we planned a last minute party and I went back to the Taco Man. It was literally 3 days before our party that I contacted the Taco Man. I emailed late at night not thinking I would get a response right away, but sure enough early in the morning I already had a response and luckily they were available. Alex with their sales team was so quick and efficient when responding. I definitely recommend the Taco Man for anyone looking for a fun and delicious caterer!"}
{"text":"After seeing the positive reviews on yelp regarding the Taco Man we decided to book him for a party at our house. Omar was very professional. We booked our event and Omar checked in with us several times before the party. We made some slight adjustments on numbers a day before and it was no issue. On the day of the event Omar's team was there 45 minutes prior to the event. His staff was very professional and courteous. The Tacos were ready to go at the start of the party, and every guest was very pleased with not only the taste, but the amount of food.
At the end of their scheduled time, the chef advised us that is was last call. I thought this was great as it gave every one last chance for more tacos. The meat and chicken were seasoned well, and the salsa was great. 
I would recommended using The Taco Man, and I know I will be at my next event."}
{"text":"The Taco Man is The MAN!
Food was delicious! It was simple yet extremely satisfying. We hired them for a Cinco de Mayo event at my office. The salsa was delicious and topped off the tacos perfectly. I would hire him again!! That's all I can say.. it was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Taco Man! The food was wonderful, it was the best party for me and my husband becuase we didn't have to do the cooking.  The clean up was easy, fast and quick.  While the party was going on the food never stopped I didn't have to give direction to anyone and I was able to host the party and ENJOY it.  I would highly recommend The Taco Man for any event."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! 1st event showed up late, didn't receive the\"free chips, quac and salsa for 50+people\", didn't want to leave leftovers, and left the yard a mess with trash. Tried it again with 2nd event, promising that \"they would make it up to me\" with the price quoted the same as 1st event of $300. Timing was better but still didn't receive the \"free chips, guac and salsa\" had to leave and go get it after I noticed. Then disputed the price after the event saying\" he did not remember our conversation about our agreement and the issues we had\". He tries to scan the free chips coupon that is on his website, and needs to take better notes on his conversations, especially with repeat clients. Do not waste your time or money on this business, there are plenty of other options to guarantee great service. Very disappointed again!"}
{"text":"We hired The Tacoman for our daughters wedding reception 9/4/16. Let me just start by saying, our Tacoman showed up on time, 10 minutes early in fact, and served great tacos and great sides. He showed up, set up everything on his own without any bother, and had our food ready on time. He was professional and courteous to our guest and everything went off without a hitch. All our guest raved about how good the tacos and sides were and we couldn't have been more pleased. If you want great tacos, great service, for a great deal use these guys! We will be using them again for our next event in Vegas! Thank you Tacoman!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this \"Taco Man\". Omar was very professional over the phone and extremely nice, but the food and actual service was another story. Omar had two high school girls running the grill. They appeared to have no interest in serving people, spent more time texting on their phones and couldn't answer basic questions about the food. They were left alone serving while Omar left to an unknown location for hours. All of the food was dry and cold, along with the canned beans and rice from a box. The meats (pastor, asada and chicken) had decent flavor, but all of them were terribly dry...especially the asada. They even asked if we had an onion. Really????!!! How does a \"Taco Man\" not have an onion? Absolutely unprofessional!!!!! For $240.00, it was definitely not worth it. Once I explained my concerns to Omar, he apologized  but made excuses as to why the service and food was subpar. Trust me, save your money on this one. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We used Omar for a 40th birthday party and everything was wonderful.  He was very helpful an contacted me several times to confirm the reservation.  I called him at least 3 times in the 24 hours before the event with questions and he answered quickly each time.  Our guest loved the food and I will use him for my next event!"}
{"text":"Don't book them for your event. I had to call them three times to confirm they were coming in the first place. They quoted us $300. I confirmed with them on the phone and it was in the email. They get to the house- food was great! The guy that came and set up was cool and but at the end they said okay $400. $10 per person, 40 people. There weren't even 40 people there. I call Omar and complain and he says its common sense if more people then more price. I thought it was a flat rate. He never said  $10 a person. 
DONT BOOK WITH HIM"}
{"text":"I used the Taco Man for my daughter's college graduation and the food was amazing. My son is getting married and they want the Taco Man for the reception. I am excited because the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"So I was doing my research on who to hire for my son's birthday party and I cam across this business that had pretty good ratings but mixed reviews. I decided to do a taco tasting since this is something they offer(listed on their website). I scheduled this online and received a confirmation. The location is not the best, but that's beyond the point. However, the owner, could not locate my confirmation so I pulled it from my phone. He later then tells me that someone came in the day prior as \"me\" to taco taste. I was confused. Regardless, he told me that we would have to PAY for the taco tasting since it was my son (who is 2), my brother and myself that came in that day. The website states they do complimentary tasting for two people so I figured we would pay for my brother's tacos and since my son is only 2 he did not need to taco taste. I informed him on this but I'm assuming that he jumped to the conclusion that we were all going to be taco tasting. His response was that he doesn't \"feed for free\" and that if we ended up booking with him he would give us a $20 credit. Ok fine, we will pay for the tacos. Turns out their location does not have a card service for payment and only accepts cash. Since we did not intend to order a lot of tacos and it was a small order he decided to not charge us. The tacos were mediocre. We decided to pay him for his tacos and decided not to do business due to the way I was treated. Poor business skills."}
{"text":"Good tacos. I'll come back for more love this taco stand. One of the best in Vegas. Recommend carne asada"}
{"text":"Horrible... Horrible... Horrible!!!  Definitely do not recommend. After giving them a deposit we were NO SHOWED!! After multiple phone calls and text attempts with no response I physically called the restaurant and was proceeded to be told lie after lie. I was told there were at my house, when obviously they weren't. I had to call back yet again and was finally able speak specifically to Omar. After being promised yet another call back I again had to call back after 40 minutes since my called back that was promised never came. Finally getting ahold of someone else they said they would call and find out the situation. Then I get a text back saying Omar was in an accident 2hrs prior when I physically spoke to Omar less then an hour ago. No remorse for not showing up or offering to refund my money. They started to be very rude and not concerned with the situation I was put in. Please understand I am not heartless. I just don't believe their story. Every time I spoke to someone it was different. So I feel as though I was definitely lied too and cheated. I definitely recommend finding someone else with better business practices."}
{"text":"didn't even show up to the event I was at. The host tried contacting them and was unable to get a hold of them. They just completely ignored his calls and we were all left without food. Thank God for pizza. Do not hire these people unless you want to risk having them not show up"}
