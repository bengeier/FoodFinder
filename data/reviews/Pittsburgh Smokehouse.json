{"text":"Went to Pittsburgh Smokehouse yesterday. Wings were good but the ribs were like a brick. Couldn't eat them. Threw them away along with my money. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. More meat than we could eat...baked beans are amazing. BBQ sauces were on point. Staff very friendly. The new NONsmoking  dining room is beautiful. Can't wait to go back, bummed we didn't spot Rick Sebak ;-)"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be our last! Excellent friendly service and great food from a family operated business.  Excellent meats and the best home made sauces. We especially enjoyed \"blast furnace\" and \"chipotle horseradish\"."}
{"text":"My first time trying out the food truck.. who doesn't love BBQ food!?  Brisket was really good and you do get bang for your buck with the amount of meat.  I love the spicy/hot bbq sauce - no doubt a good kick to it - just how I like it.   I tried the sides - cole slaw and mac and cheese.  Ok ... sure they are great accompaniments to the meal - but at the same time was a bit \"meh\".   I didn't even finish.  They didn't have a home cooked flavor or anything special about them - very average.  Overall it was decent food from a local food truck and definitely better than fast food -
 no doubt!! Thanks Pittsburgh Smokehouse BBQ!"}
{"text":"I've tasted BBQ from all over the South, but never did I ever expect to find the ABSOLUTE BEST BBQ in Pittsburgh!!  WOW!!  PITTSBURGH SMOKEHOUSE has the juiciest, tastiest smoked meats, beans (that are so special I can't even describe--just go get some!!). Only do I wish they delivered to Florida!  Whenever I go to Pitt my first stop in This place!  Andy the Pittmaster has some amazing dishes he's created that will blow your mind!  I especially love his BLAST FURNACE sauce on his Bacon Burger Bombs & the smoked wings are unlike anything you've ever had!"}
{"text":"Grabbed the 50/50 sandwich from this food truck today and it was legit. It was loaded with brisket, pulled pork, and slaw.  I put some of the \"blast furnace\" bbq sauce on and it enhanced the flavors of everything.  Be careful because I love spicy food and this was definitely hot.  Highly recommend this truck."}
{"text":"I've tried different items off the food truck, but was finally able to make it to the restaurant for dinner last night. There were 6 of us and everyone had a fantastic meal. The fresh chips and dip were spot on as an appetizer, the baked beans were delicious and my brisket was perfect as usual. We really wanted to try the ribs, but they were out. I guess we will have to go back another night to try again. The waitress did a great job on her own as busy as they were."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews, I  was certainly looking forward to getting some good bbq around the burgh but....i decided to get the 3 meat platter which actually only consists of meat and no sides or bread so for another 7.50 I added 2 sides and 3 rolls but didn't care as long as it was good.  The pork was pretty good but the brisket consisted of mostly of fat and was unappetizing to say the least.  Kielbasa was smoked very nicely but had not other discerning values.  Sides were acceptable but for 27 bucks not even close to worth it.  Very dissappointed"}
{"text":"Friendliest people, best bbq in Pittsburgh, cheap food, and one of the best yinzer bars around. People in Lawrenceville would totally be jealous of this place! 

I highly recommend the pulled pork, whether it is on the sandwich, fries, or salad. It is my favorite!  Can't go wrong with combining their bbq sauce with the chipotle sauce. It's all homemade and delicious! (Don't be afraid to combine the pulled pork and brisket... Kind of like a little taste of heaven).

Just some caution, this place does allow smoking. Some nights are heavier than others. Overall a Pittsburgh hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Andy from Pittsburgh Smokehouse does a lot of catering for the local film & television business, and that's how I first found out about his food.  Everything I have ever tasted has been excellent, and I have had food both on set, and have also eaten catered spreads at two events at the Italian Club on Lower Rodi Road (Rick Sebak of WQED was also at both events, so you know the food is wonderful).  And it's not just the meats, but the side dishes were fabulous as well (One of my favorites was some of the most delicious Brussels Sprouts I ever remember eating).  A lot of the dishes are extremely creative too, like \"Rattlesnake Tails,\" which were bacon wrapped  jalape√±o poppers . . . Yummers!    
This past week, Pittsburgh Smokehouse catered some of our meals on set, hot breakfasts and lunches too.  Everybody on the cast and crew seemed to really enjoy the food.  Thanks Andy!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp & glad I tried it. The food is amazing. I had the ribs with the chipotle horseradish sauce and the brisket sandwich. It was awesome. The brisket definitely needs the sauce but it is nice & tender."}
{"text":"When I have a taste for something, I often go to great lengths to obtain that foodstuff...
I had been in the hospital for a great length of time and as soon as I was allowed to eat food, I wanted some seafood and some barbecue.   My sister obliged me by taking me to a local seafood restaurant and I had that fix satisfied right away.  Now onto the barbecue fix...  Hmmm...Where to go???

I live in the eastern suburbs and the nearest decent barbecue place that I was familiar with is located in the actual City of Pittsburgh.  I had heard that there was a barbecue place not far from me and I set off to find it.  I went over hill and dale, into nooks and crannies, still no barbecue to be had.  Humph!  

I was about to give up my search when I happened to read an article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that mentioned a \"local to me\" barbecue spot that was participating in an upcoming pirogi festival.  What?  Barbecue and pirogies???  Anyhow, I followed the directions that were posted and low and behold, this joint is located minutes from my home.   Here's the kicker!  The Pittsburgh Smokehouse is located in the Italian American Citizens Club on Lower Rodi Rd in Turtle Creek.  WTH!  You have to look for the big azz smoker sitting outside.  (BTW, it's cash only)
Let me tell you something...The food there made my pilgrimage worth it.  Tender, smoky beef brisket that fell apart after touching it. (Real smoke flavor too!   Not liquid smoke smoky, but long hours of knowing what you're doing smoky!)  Smoky, crispy wings, fresh cut fries and macaroni and cheese, chile please.   Lord a mercy!  I have a new barbecue spot in my neck of the woods to go to.  Those Chipotle Horseradish and Blast Furnace BBQ sauces were scrumpdilly-icious!  How did I miss this place?

Anywho, don't go looking for some fancy schmancy place.  This is a local bar/grill/club that has great smoked meats and sides and the wait staff is friendly.  I may have to set aside funding to ensure that I have enough money to keep myself supplied with their brisket and wings..."}
