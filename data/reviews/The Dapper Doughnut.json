{"text":"The dapper doughnut really exceeded my expectations. The doughnuts are cooked fresh in front of you and are served piping hot. They are like little bites of heaven and they have a good selection of toppings for these bite sized doughnuts. Their employees are super kind and welcoming and will help explain their menu if need be. Definitely check this place out- great location, you will see it when you walk in from the parking garage. If you don't see it, you sure will smell it!"}
{"text":"The PB&J milkshake is fire. Great decor and great service. No idea what that Donna lady is talking about, the coffee is fantastic. Desert winds uses their Burundi blend that isn't plain at all. Gotta love yelp food/beverage critics that have no concept of taste. Nice to see a local coffee roaster providing the coffee to a business on the strip."}
{"text":"Had samples of their freshly made donuts at epicurean this year and I was blown away. Out of all the restaurants and food vendors there, this was definitely one of my favorites! I hope they open a local little donut shop in town so I won't have to drive all the way to MGM for these donuts everyday. Haha!"}
{"text":"I'm a local and 2 out of the 3 times, I drove all the way down to dapper donut in all the traffic my donuts were not made fresh they were already sitting in the basket and they were cold . my first experience was good but I think because the manager waited on me, but theother 2 times really sucked fur the price they cost it's a shame BUT IF YOU GO AND TRY THEM BE AWARE AND ASK FOR THEM TO BE MADE IN FRONT OF YOU.."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go most every day on my way into work. It's right inside from the parking garage - so great location for anyone coming in or leaving for that car ride out... ALWAYS made fresh.  I like to bring them as incentives for my team and just as a treat for them all. I love the variety of flavors and the cute bite sizes! You can smell them all the way down the hall!

The staff there is so nice and always so helpful. I've come morning, afternoon and even late night after a concert. Always fresh, and always an amazing staff!

I'm all about the Sin City and the Fluffer Nutters! ALL DAY EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for alerting me to The Dapper Doughnut's existence! I've been down the downstairs \"restaurant alley\" of the MGM, but it's changed a lot & I wouldn't have thought to go down there. 

The Dapper Doughnut is basically customizable, mini donuts (the size of doughnut holes). The friendly worker let us sample one of the cinnamon sugar donuts and I was sold faster than you could say \"The Dapper Doughnut\"! 

I thought it would be like underwhelming like Pips in Portland, but these were so good - very fresh, soft, & warm. Also, I'm usually a cake doughnut person, so I'm not easily persuaded by yeast doughnuts. 

You can get 6 piece (up to 2 different types of flavors), 12 piece (up to 4 different flavors), 24 piece (up to 6 different flavors) & 48 piece. From there, you choose your flavors! We went for half cinnamon sugar and then s'mores (chocolate drizzle topped with a mini marshmallow & chocolate (chocolate drizzle with rainbow sprinkles). Also, the box that it comes in is so cute! Definitely dapper. 

Only complaint is that there was no seating anywhere to enjoy our delightful doughnuts!

{"text":"Dapper Donut is a tiny spot to get tiny donuts for a (relatively) tiny price in the Underground area of MGM. Perfect for a treat when you're running early (am I the only one who does that?) to an event or when your friends are perpetually running late to meet you (insert hard side eye here).

The 6 piece is $6 and the 'nuts are light and made fresh to order. The cinnamon sugar flavor is often recommended by the staff, but I most recently tried PBJ, Nutella Dream, and Turtle. They were all pretty tasty but I wish they had grape for the PBJ rather than just reusing the strawberry syrup (previous photos show real strawberries on the ND?). Flavors with a sauce drizzle and a sprinkle for texture seem to be the best bang for your buck (turtle, strawberry bella, smores). 

NOTE: The 6 piece is currently only available in 2 flavors per new policy. If you're polite they may still do 3, so you and a friend can try a few each. So be nice!"}
{"text":"We ran across this place by accident. It's in the underground of MGM. They had free samples out and after trying them we had to indulge. The cinnamon sugar doughnuts are to die for!!! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for locals and tourists. Must try. Prices are good for the quality and freshness. Everything is made to order. MGM has paid parking but it's free as long as you leave before the hour marker. We come just for this and always make it out with free parking. Right when you leave the parking lot to get into MGM it's right in the corner. Nicole is so helpful and awesome. By far my favorite donut shop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't care for it. Small and meh tasting donuts. We all agreed the mini packaged ones at a gas station are better for much less $."}
{"text":"We stopped by on an early Sunday afternoon for a snack. I initially thought it was a regular-sized donut place. But mini donuts are good too.

The location is convenient if you parked in MGM's garage, but I parked at the free parking at the Tropicana so it's a bit of a walk over to this underground hallway at the Grand. 

It's only a counter, but it's a nice counter. The service is friendly.

Basically, delicious mini donuts in a variety of flavors. I won't necessarily go out of my way to get these, but if you are in the area they are worth a taste."}
{"text":"So in consistent fashion, I am FINALLY able to get around to this review with two visits now under my belt here and the 5 star rating doesn't do justice here. Go figure, I despise Dapper Day at Disneyland, but I am going gaga for The Dapper Doughnut in MGM!

Thanks to scouting it out ahead of time navigating here was a breeze. You start on the park map (literally) in the front lobby of MGM and head towards the Brad Garrett Comedy Club which almost seems like a walk of shame as I was there when they first opened. These are the perfect comfort food though with or without the shame. Ha-ha! I think by far the best part is, you'll know when you're getting close to it. Immediately when turning the corner you can smell the freshly prepared doughnuts from a mile away. I practically full on sprinted at that point and I am a very \"leisurely\" walker if you get my drift.

Before I get to the food I do have to recognize the staff. On both occassions I had nothing but top notch politeness. Although when you do seem overly excited to devour their craft I'd think that brings out a good mood from anyone. I enjoy the time they take when creating each doughnut flavor and don't treat the experience like a conveyor belt. Call me crazy, but I really do appreciate that most of all. 

On a semi empty stomach this will suck, but now time to start describing the doughnuts. I have chosen the 12 pack each time because it seems really like a steal at a $8.99 price tag even for miniature doughnuts. They allow you up to 4 different flavors and as you can see from my picture of the menu there is so much to be desired. It took me FOREVER to decide (I'm talking days in advance) and even when I was there waiting to order I was so back and forth. Yes I am that die hard when it comes to mini doughnuts and crazy enough to say these can compete with my favorite (mini doughnuts from the Minnesota State Fair). It's taken me about 30 years to find a place that could?!?

So overall, I can say that these are super soft as they are made to order and not caked in oil or grease so I can sum its appearance up in one word: Dapper. They get delicately placed in a blue to-go box, but truthfully eat them right away. I ate mine while on the Monorail (the second visit) and while they were still marvelous, nothing would beat in the moment.

The Smores one is literally just that. It's like having a personal camp site on the strip. I thought the marshmallow on the top was an intricate touch and one of the few places that advertise Smores and have it taste like it! I also selected Turtle pretty much because of drooling over the pictures on Yelp at the time of discovering this. I did enjoy the caramel sauce and chopped pecan crumble topping, but it really didn't move me to want more (just my preference). What did and certainly what I'd call a sleeper flavor was the Blueberry Lemon. I tried this one because I adore blueberries, but deep down I went in thinking this combo was going to flop, but boy was I wrong. It is a bit on the sweet side, but it really was layered well. You get that punch of blueberry at first and then hooks in the lemon and the vanilla aftertaste is a guaranteed twelve round TKO. If you're tossed between what to get I'd say bet on this one! Also during the initial visit I had the PB+J and that is another surprise. It tastes just like the sandwich and it took me back while \"adulting\". Being an adult I guess really has its perks?!?

All in all, I don't know of an opportunity beyond this to get a mini doughnut on the strip, but my prayers were certainly answered! For a light snack or even breakfasting like yours truly your tummy will say double down on 20 for a visit to Dapper Doughnut!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and free mini donut samples. They also offer a 50% military discount, which rocks!"}
{"text":"THE warmest, softest, cutest, tiniest donuts you'll ever need in your life!!!!!!!!!!

They have SO many different flavors to choose from and they'll so unique! We ordered 24 donuts, but I'm pretty sure we could've finished all 48. I wasn't the one who ordered though so I'm not sure how many flavors you can choose for each set.

We got the Cinnamon Sugar, Blueberry Lemon Glaze, Strawberry Bella, and PB & J. But I would definitely go back for the Smores, Turtle, Fluffer Nutter, and Cinn City (no idea what that is but I like the sound of it).

10/10 would get Cinnamon Sugar again. Same with Blueberry Lemon Glaze, which has a blueberry on top! It's super cute and colorful.

Probably wouldn't get the Strawberry Bella or PB&J again though. Strawberry Bella was strawberry glaze with cinnamon sugar on top I think. For the PB&J, I think the jelly kinda overpowered the peanut butter.

I think it's also SUPER fun that you get to watch them create these donuts."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEEEE their tiny donuts!!  MUST EAT!!!  

I like to think I'm a connoisseur of donuts. I eat them religiously every Sunday.  Probable eat it more often than I go to mass. Also, I'm original from Portland, OR where we are supposed to be known for our Voodoo donuts which I rather like to call Voodoo-dookey! I think their donut is just mediocre & over priced. Not sure what the hype is over them. I think Safeway donuts are way better than them.  Remember this is just MY opinion so don't hate on me cuz you are addicted to Dookey donuts k. 

Anyways, about these amazing fluffy delicious small donuts. Words cannot describe how amazing these donuts are! We flew in a couple of days ago & every single day we've been getting them.  It is magic in your mouth. The soft donut literally melts as it touches your lips. So delicious!! I think it's made of cake flour or something so it's not dense as most donuts. 

They have several flavors to pick from, but my favorite is cinnamon & sugar. If I'm courageous I'll get their powder donuts, but I gotta check to make sure the powder isn't all around my mouth or on my chest/clothes.

If you have any issues with your donuts one of the owner will usually be working & they will handle any issues you have. They believe in providing excellent service! They will even give you a sample of their donuts if you are unsure of making a purchase. Really great guys & I love that they work there so you are sure to get great customer service. 

I hope the next time I come back to MGM they will still be here or my  would break a little.  It's my lil taste of heaven!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little pit stop on the way to the rideshare area. Enjoy a freshly made petite doughnuts. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. They're an assortment of flavors. My favorite is the Loco coco which is chocolate drizzle with crisp coconut flakes.  The value packs come with a free beverage. 6pk of two flavors was $5.99 + free beverage with tax was about $8.00. Definitely worth dropping by if you get the chance! You won't feel guilty after it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  You can smell the doughnuts baking on the casino floor.  I was on my way to ride on the monorail when I walked by.  There wee samples to try and I was simply amazed at how light and airy the doughnuts were.  Simply delicious!!!  I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I had made a special order 3 weeks in advance of 50 mini donuts for a baby shower. Even supplied them with photos of what I was looking for, they said they could accommodate me. The morning I went to go pick up donuts, the gentleman working said he'd be right back-- I assumed to go get the donuts. He immediately starts making them right then, they weren't ready upon pickup and because of this he was rushing to make them. The icing did not stick to the donuts because they were too hot and then when he went to put the pearl sprinkles on, none of them stuck because there was no icing to stick to. They were incredibly sloppy looking, and not at all what I would expect with an advanced notice. I even had to add my own blue icing to them just so they looked decent enough to serve at the event. They should be embarrassed to serve anything that they aren't proud of, and those looked terrible. Definitely would not go through them again."}
{"text":"The perfect little sweet snack! Customer service was great, even after we accidentally spilled coffee all over their stand . We ordered the cinnamon one, the one that tastes like a cinnamon roll and the Nutella one. 
Sooo good
Not heavy, just airy, soft, and fresh. Will return on our next visit."}
{"text":"Wow!! What can I say. Tommy is the MAN! hooked us up with a hot dozen. Got to try these!"}
{"text":"I picked up a few boxes for my office for a little Sunday treat and these turned out to be a massive hit! I didn't get enough, as they were all gone within 5 minutes! The doughnuts were great and we got really good service from Alexis as well. Definitely recommended for a quick snack or to feed a full office as well."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan doughnuts but I'll never really crave them in particular...UNTIL NOW!

They are made to order and are soooo yummy! Nice  and hot with a little crisp to them! Perfect little snack to have! 

The toppings are in perfect proportion! 
We had the Nutella, sugar, cinnamon and s'mores! The cinnamon and s'mores are a definitely must!"}
{"text":"I literally made it a point to stop by here on our recent Vegas trip and it was totally worth it! Very cute bite sized donuts that are definitely a hit with kids! My boys loved them and the flavors are all so good! Will definitely come back when we're back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh boy! this place was one of the best things of our vegas trip. They are located inside MGM Grand towards the Uber/rideshare area. We walked by it and were pulled in by the smell of the freshly made donuts.

They make them right there after you order them and then lay the toppings on them. One amazing experience that we lived all the 3 days we were in Vegas!

Will come here every time we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Despite getting catfished by their bananas foster doughnut ad, the fresh to order mini-doughnuts drizzled with your choice of sauce were fun to eat.  The use of little marshmallows and the blueberries for toppings gave the doughnuts some added flavor.

The service was a bit iffy as they didn't even provide a straw for my iced coffee.  With your coffee and doughnuts in hand you better keep walking, as there is literally no place to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"hands down the best donuts! i don't think i can eat a regular donut again with thinking about these. they literally melt in your mouth! they have so many toppings to choose from, it was hard to just pick a few of them. AND the donut milkshake, trust me it is definitely better than it probably sounds. it's definitely worth the purchase. 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing! They were a party hit. Love that they are hit size and easy to try lots of flavors"}
{"text":"Made to order! So fresh and good! Especially the lemon ones and the owner was really nice !"}
{"text":"Nothing special - they're just mini cake donuts with different flavored drizzles. Agree with Donna - I had a really hard time reading the menu between placement and the art design of it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Fresh mini donuts that are delicious! Classics like cinnamon sugar, and fun flavors like smore's and Nutella! Can't wait to come back and get more for the office, I bought 2 dozen and they were gone in less than 10min"}
{"text":"I usually don't post negative reviews, but the service we received was so bad, it left me upset, so I'm posting.

We walked by this shoppe on our way into the MGM and I told my husband we'd pick some up on our way out.  I was very excited to try these cute little bit-sized donuts!  

We walked up to the counter on our way out to order.  There was no one else around.  We were trying to decide what to get and ended up with a 24-pack.  The gal working stared at us without any expression most of this time, while we were trying to decide on flavors.  She rang us up efficiently, but didn't say much of anything or even crack a smile.  It was nice to see the donuts being made in front of us and I got quite a kick out of it.  Still, she said nothing.  She finished making and boxing them and handed them to us without a word.  No thank you, have a good night, or goodbye.  I was disappointed to say the least.

The donuts themselves were not bad.   They tasted excellent while fresh and hot, but were soggy when they cooled.  I would probably give them another try if someone else made them, but it will be awhile.  She was so unfriendly, I can't imagine going back or sending out of town visitors to this shoppe."}
{"text":"Cute little small spot to grab mini donuts. I ordered 6 small cinnamon donuts with an ice coffee. They have either cinnamon or powder sugar I believe. You can add toppings and other stuff for the donut. I didn't  like the way they did their menu it was on the board on the wall and it was kinda hard to see it while you order because it's wrapped around so you can't see it while you order so I had a hard time remembering what to order. The small cinnamon donut was good but I did get a bad one and it was super hard. The ice coffee was just plain and you can add cream and sugar to it so it was nothing special. I probably would just come back here for some small donuts."}
{"text":"Cake doughnuts and specialty doughnuts are some of my favorite cheat day foods. This place is nothing but spectacular making these perfect bite size pieces. The batter is made fresh in house and has a great flavor on its own, but adding the toppings makes these delectable minis so delicious. It doesn't matter which flavor you choose to get, all the flavors here are good and it's not overly done with the toppings. Did I mention they put the toppings on all by hand and as you order it? Yes it's freshly fried up then topped off nicely.

I wish that they had more spots because having to drive to the strip is the only thing I don't like to do but for these I can."}
{"text":"Overall: cute but small place, fresh donuts, large menu 

I had seen this place on food instagrams but we just happened to walk by it in MGM Grand. You can smell it as soon as you walk in, the donuts are freshly made and so delicious!

They have a wide variety of options on the menu. We got the smores donut, the turtle, and lemon blueberry. Each one was great! They cook the donuts and then add the toppings to order. When you get 6 donuts, you can only choose 2 flavors, but the employee was nice to us since we didn't have a line and let us have 3 flavors. The toppings add a nice sweetness and the donuts are still warm from the frier and so soft! I am a big mini donut fan and these did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to be on the strip and have this again at MGM. Such a yummy, crispy, buttery delight for your mouth. Although, I can remember the flavors we chose, the strawberry graham cracker sticks out in my mind. It was just the right flavor and the right amount of crisp. 

Loved watching them get made and flip right in front of you and that they top them right there. Super delicious and fresh donuts!"}
{"text":"These donuts are awesome! Better than any donut shop in town. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a cute shop in the Underground of MGM Grand Hotel. I got their 6 donut holes combo which comes with a drink. I paid $7. The cashier told me I could order two toppings. I got their Nutella Dream and Strawberry Bella. They were good but nothing out of the ordinary truthfully. Nutella Dream was nutella drizzle and a tiny strawberry topped in the middle. Strawberry Dream was strawberry sauce with small graham cracker crumbs I believe. basically paid $1 each hole and the drink I selected was OJ. They gave me a small oj bottle. I just wasn't really that impressed."}
{"text":"When I saw this spot I knew I had to try it because I love donuts. The entire premise of this place is, they make your doughnuts fresh to order. I told the cashier-donut maker that I wanted 3 cinnamon sugar and 3 turtle donuts. She proceeds to make me 3 powdered sugar and 3 turtle. When I brought it to her attention that she messed up my order she tells me \"powdered sugar is what I heard ....sorry about that\" and hands me the box of donuts.  Needless to say I had to let her know as calmly as I could, just because you heard powdered sugar doesn't mean I ordered powdered sugar I ordered cinnamon sugar and I should get what I paid for. At this point she's smacking her lips, crossing her eyes, and coming to the realization that she f'ed up. She asked with attitude, if I wanted her to remake my order. I politely told her no... at this point I didn't want this silly child touching anything else I was gonna put in my mouth.  But before I left, I had to let her know that she really shouldn't fight with the customer and tell them that whatever she hears is what your gonna get!!! That is never a good idea. My Moral of the story, the Dapper Doughnut was not that Dapper. Poor customer service is never appreciated."}
{"text":"This place is located just underground of MGM GRAND. Staffs are friendly, price is fair, and the doughnuts are small but it's super crunchy and yummy! I have tried 4 of the 14 flavors they offer and I'll certainly be back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! It's not anything special like the mini-donuts you find in Pier 39 in SF. 

They took a while to make them since, I guess someone messed with the machine and the guy working there is new."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick bite. It's located right at the entrance (from the parking garage) so if you're like me, you pick up a bag of half dozen bites and walk the casino floor with an easy snack.  Actually, they didn't even make it to the lobby - I'd already devoured them. 

The downside to the Dapper is that the yummy, warm, lightly crunchy donut bites are made to order, and today there was only one gentleman making the orders. With two people ahead of me, I waited what felt like 5 minutes and left with only the cinnamon sugar flavor. There's lots of toppings to customize your 6, 12, or more donetts, but it felt like I was insisted upon the cinnamon sugar when I asked about the others. Maybe it was to save time. 

Well, I'll come back soon and try then! With MGM's parking being free for the first hour it's no hassle."}
{"text":"What a great find here at the MGM! My husband and I are enjoying a staycation and we love donuts! The owner is fellow Air Force, as is my husband, and he gave us the best customer service. Both employees were pleasant and the donuts were delicious! Highly recommend this place when coming to the MGM. They're located in \"The Underground\" right when you come in from the parking garage. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The woman working the counter was so sweet! I wanted a variation of two of their donuts and she happily obliged with no extra charge! Not to mention the donuts were absolutely delicious. You will certainly want a minimum of at least 6 to yourself seeing as they are about half a bite each. If you are staying at the MGM or neaby I strongly suggest giving them a try."}
{"text":"I've swung in here a few times while at MGM. On my most recent visit I was with a girlfriend and her son. We literally ordered ALL the flavors. Cinnamon rolls are my jam so I had to try that one and I love anything Nutella. That was also a winner.

The donuts are made fresh and the are oh-so-perfectly-tiny. It's a one bite kind of donut and they are super light. This means you can order and eat a dozen and it feels like you've only had one of regular size. I'm very experienced in this, trust me.

They have coffee too. Win-win."}
{"text":"I was getting to ride the monorail for a travel episode and found Dapper Donuts directly inside the MGM from the parking area.  It's location was convenient for a perfect stop along on my way and the fresh sweet smell drew me in.  

The donuts here might be small, more like a donut hole, but they pack a huge punch of flavor!!  So many varieties blending sugars, syrups and toppers for anything you could want for a sweet treat.   

I tried a dozen and mixed the flavors.   You can get up to 4 per box, though because I was shooting an vlog I got a little sampler treat of all the flavors.  My favorites were the s'more and CinCity.   S'more was topped with a little marshmallow such a cute box!!! 

Best stop on the strip for a familiar treat done an unfamiliar way!!!"}
