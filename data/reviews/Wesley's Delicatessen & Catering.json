{"text":"Another fantastic sandwich today, prompted me to review. It is a bit hidden around the corner of 4th and Wood. I have not found a place that can make a sandwich as good. I enjoy the coleslaw too, creamy and fresh crisp cabbage.   Do try, and you'll go back again. Portion of a sandwich is plenty. The special 1/2 sandwich and side is a great deal."}
{"text":"The soups are great here and so is Wes! Friendly, fast service. Wes makes a point to introduce himself to new customers and gives them a free cookie (which are quite good).  The soups are hearty and choices change daily. Personal favorite so far is lentil & vegetables. They use Boars Head meat in the sandwiches which is high quality & also sell it by the pound. They have great sandwich choices and I like how they are named after different areas of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really good deli, which seems to be hard to come by down town. Great selection, healthy portions, fresh high-quality ingredients and nice selection of sides. Only downside is that it takes a while to get your order (since most of the sandwiches are served hot) but it's worth the wait. It's tucked away in the former bank vault so it's easy to miss. It's a great alternative to the million subways and au bon pains that proliferate downtown. I plan to be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Today wasn't my first stop at Wesley's Deli, but it may be my last.  And only because there are several good sandwich locations nearby and closer to me and what I got was not what I was expecting.
I phoned first to order what their menu calls the \"POINT PARK\" sandwich described in their menu as follows: \"Marinated portabella mushroom topped with roasted red peppers, melted picante provolone cheese served with lettuce and tomato on 7 grain bread\".
When I arrived and paid, the gentleman at the register (named on my receipt as owner Wesley) calls out to the counter person who answers back that my sandwich  is not in fact prepared or ready.  For my inconvenience Wesley says that I can pick out a cookie or brownie.

When the counter man calls out \"POINT PARK\" I went to retrieve my sandwich.

And what I got was some sort of quinoa looking goo topped with two tomato slices on a brioche bun.  And the quinoa goo was cold.

There is certainly a chance that the wrong sandwich was made or picked up but I will say that (a) there was only myself and one other person waiting for a sandwich and (b) when counterman called out \"POINT PARK\" this was the sandwich bag in his hand.  so you decide.

I've posted pictures of what I picked up today.  Total cost for this bland mistake was $12.64 including tip (which as I said before I paid before pick up and certainly before returning to my office).

They are probably nice people but with other options in this area I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Most days when eating out for lunch I want exactly what Wesley's offers: A great sandwich or  delicious soup at a friendly place with a varied menu of new items and old classics.

The soups are homemade and ridiculously good. Hello Peruvian Shrimp and Corn Chowder where have you been all my life? Hungarian Mushroom? New England Clam Chowder? Italian Wedding? Someone stop me before I make this a dangerous habit. Wes is very kind to offer free soup samples while you wait, and I've loved every soup I've tried.

They also have an choice of Stratta and Quiche that I have yet to try but look very good, as well as several salad options. There is something for everyone on the menu.

The quality of the meats, cheeses and breads is fantastic. The sandwiches are large and Wesley's features a daily whole and half sandwich special. Again- usually a great deal and always delicious. PRO Tip:  Wesley posts the daily specials on his Facebook page every day. Check it out.

Looking for the best BLT downtown? The bacon is incredible so do yourself a favor and order the Polish Hill immediately.

On top of all this- the staff is extremely friendly and always working diligently when I've stopped by.

A regret i have is that when I order to-go, i have to choose my order carefully. If I were to order a Rueben and walk the 7 minutes back to my office or meet a friend, by the time i get there the sandwich has steamed in the wrap causing some difficult/messy eating. On the flip side, the sandwich is fresh and hot- so I'm not sure how the steam can be prevented.

The other regret is that there is only limited counter seating by the window, but this hasn't prevented me from stopping in as often as I can.

Every neighborhood needs a place like Wesley's."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich on really fresh Ciabatta bread.  What ever the sauce they used was Excellent.  I had the strip district.  The coleslaw was just ok, very liquidy but had good fresh taste.  Tried a sample of the Italian wedding which is house made, superb taste and quality."}
{"text":"The food is great and the customer service when Wesley is behind the register is top notch.  Service like that is so hard to find nowadays.  Everything I have ordered off the menu is fresh and delicious.  The bacon is like none I've ever had which makes the Polish Hill my favorite.  The only downfall here is the younger guy who sometimes handles the register subbing in for Wesley.  He's usually doing the cooking when not behind the register and his attitude comes off like he doesn't want to be there and can be a little combative with customers.  The customer is always right even when they are wrong.  I get annoyed by people from time to time (my wife would probably say that's an understatement), but when you're in the service industry you have to hide your personal feelings and suck it up for the good of the business.   Anything customers ask, Wesley does it without hesitation.  That's pretty much the only negative when dining here.  Don't let it deter you from trying it because if you get Wesley he'll make sure you're leaving in a better mood than when you came in.  Everybody else in the place is consistently friendly.  And one more time...don't leave without trying the bacon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday and had what is now my favorite breakfast sandwich. Wes was very friendly and took great care in making my sandwich. Very convenient for the Point Park University community, though not a lot of seating. Four stars for now until I try lunch. Looking forward to trying the pastrami."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. So I cannot speak to space or the inside experience. 

I read all these reviews and thought, shit why not just treat myself today to a lunch at work.
I got the pulled pork sandwich with bacon and muenster cheese and bbq sauce. It came with a choice of side. I picked one. I added on a brownie titled \"THE best brownie\"

My food arrived VERY quickly. Was still pretty warm when it arrived as well.

My sandwich was soggy (I expected that since its a very \"wet\" sandwich). The pork tasted alright. The muenster cheese was a great compliment. It was messy and sloppy, all the things i like about a pulled pork sandwich. They neglected to include the side I had chosen, but the sandwich was more than enough to fill me up so I didn't bother calling. Honestly... I didn't need it. 
The brownie: well i'd not call it \"THE BEST\" but it was good. Not cakey like some and not incredibly fudgy either. Just the right amount of both. It was good. I split it with one of my coworkers. She was far more enthused with it than I was. 

I'd try more from this place. Perhaps I'll walk over next time and see what else they have, daily specials or whatever. 

For the price i paid, including a delivery fee and whatever else tax they included and a tip I spent about 17 dollars. Which is why it's three stars and not 4."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service! The owner, Wes, is so awesome and is willing to give samples without you even asking for them. He also gives all first-time customers a free homemade cookie!

What you'd expect from any deli, the menu consists of sandwiches, soups, and salads. Soups are homemade, which make sure you ask for a sample. They also have a daily special. While they can build a sandwich any way you'd like, they also have a huge selection of pre-determined choices that aren't just your ordinary turkey or ham sandwich. 

This will be a regular stop for me when I'm in the mood for a good sandwich for lunch!"}
{"text":"There are a few \"Gourmet Delis\" popping up around town and anything that adds variety for downtown workers is always a good thing.  Wesley's is probably the smallest of this Genre, which probably includes Erin's, the Bluebird Cafe and a few others, but apparently nobody told Wesley, so there is a huge variety of excellent salads, soups, sandwiches and desserts to choose from.  I've eaten there about 6 times so far.  Each time I've ordered a different type of sandwich from the menu along with soup and a dessert.  Today, I had a Brookline Blaster, which is a pulled pork sandwich with bacon.  It was huge and easily the best BBQ sandwich I have found downtown.  Wesley gave me a sample of his tomato soup (with all kinds of other stuff in it) and, rather than tell him I don't like tomato soup, I went ahead and tried it.  Surprise!  I liked THIS tomato soup!   I topped it all off with a piece of chocolate cake.   They also have an excellent breakfast menu!    GO ahead and try the place.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tiny deli with big taste! They have a pretty great menu, I always go for a Reuben sandwich when it's offered and the one from Wesley's didn't disappoint! The man behind the register (Wes, who I assume is the owner?) was very polite and friendly with all of the guests who came up. Let them know of their options and of toppings they could change on the sandwiches, thanked everyone for coming in and trying it out. There were 3 other people working behind the counter, a grill guy, a sandwich builder, and the QC/order completion gal who got whatever side you had ordered and handed you your bag of food.

The Reuben was good overall. Bread was grilled, but not too dry and rough, also not soggy. The sauerkraut was plentiful on top of the corned beef held together with swiss and thousand islands dressing - traditional Reuben style. The redskin potato salad was the (unhealthy) side I chose and was a good addition to the sandwich. They do have a small counter by the window with about 5 bar stools, but we took ours to go. When you check in on Yelp, you get a coupon for a free cookie, too! Overall it was a great experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and Wesley's did not disappoint! I was greeted by Wes himself, given a large sample of the wedding soup (with the urging to always ask for anything I wanted to sample, even the meats and cheeses!) and handed a sandwich loyalty card. I was even given a free cookie with my order, since I was a first timer. The sandwich I ordered was another highlight- bacon was delicious and cooked to order, egg salad had the perfect amount of mayo. I will definitely be back to fill up more punches on my card!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh needs more places like this!  The fixed menu has countless great sandwich, and other options.  But what I really love are the daily soup/sandwich specials.  You can NEVER get board eating at this place because there is always something new for the daily special!  I at one point I ate at Wesley's almost every day for 3 months and I never had the same soup twice!

The food is great and the prices are reasonable!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"My bus drives by this place every morning, and I've been meaning to try it for a while.  Finally did today with my boyfriend - spectacular food and service.  I got the special, and he got the strip district sandwich.. with sides of pasta salad and macaroni salad.  YUM!  The owner could not have been sweeter - and amazing food on top of the service.  Finally a legit deli in downtown worth re-visiting.  Couldn't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place IS as good as it gets.  The owner, Wesley, is super friendly, helps you decide if you are unsure of what you want - offers samples of the soups - which are are all delicious, and the sandwiches are top notch, high quality additive-free deli meats & high end bread.
Prices are great too!

AVACADO IS NOT EXTRA!!"}
{"text":"I just came back from Wesley's and boy, was I impressed all around! The owner and staff was incredibly nice! They offered me a sample of their Manhattan clam chowder while I waited for my sandwich and they gave me a free cookie! The soup was really good and I was happy to see a Manhattan claim chowder on a menu for once!

I ordered the special of the day which was a grilled shrimp po boy with lettuce and spicy remoulade. The sandwich was the perfect size, which is important to me as to not overeat at lunch. I also was happy that the shrimp was grilled because often breading and batters are too much on a sandwich.The remoulade was spicy and had a good amount of capers in it (love). The sandwich also came with a choice of side so I got coleslaw. The coleslaw was solid, nothing special but I love a standard coleslaw so it wasn't a bad thing. All around, a great experience, I am super happy to go back. My only regret is that I devoured the sandwich before taking a picture of its beauty!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Wesley's Deli for lunch when I was home last and it was delicious!  The area definitely needed something like Wesley's and now they have it.  I can be picky about my reubens and this was one of the best.  For a no frills, fast, delicious sammy look no further"}
{"text":"I noticed this place a while ago, mainly because they sell Boar's Heads meats by the pound, as well as serve breakfast and lunch, so I stopped in one day strictly to buy some deli stuff for the BF. The corned beef was wonderful, which is not a surprise because it's Boar's Head, but besides that, they were so NICE! They asked me if I had been there before, and when I responded no, they gave me a free soup to taste-it was delicious- and a cookie and offered me a soda...They really were wonderful. I can't wait to go back for breakfast or lunch, which looked amazing. They have a pretty diverse menu as well. Over all what I have tried was really good and REASONABLE, not always the case in Downtown, and the staff was over the top nice, not usually the case..."}
{"text":"To avoid repetition, I'll simply concur with most everyone else's review:
* Wes (owner?) was super friendly
* Free soup sample
* Free cookie
* Quick service
* Spectacular sandwich (I had the Northside Chicken)
* Extraordinary soup (I had the stuffed pepper soup)
* Quality ingredients

My only complaint is that there isn't more seating; only a counter with four stools along the window. But that's not enough to offset the great service and product that they put out. I give it a deserving five stars and would highly recommend Wesley's Delicatessen & Catering to any and all."}
{"text":"I stopped in here this afternoon on a whim as I was in the vicinity.  It's a tiny place with a few seats in front of the window but it has super nice people and even better food!  I saw that there were daily specials posted, but I was hungry for the West End sandwich wrap.  

It did not disappoint - the oven roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, onions, and pepper jack cheese were wrapped tightly in a wheat wrap with a dousing of chipotle mayo that had a kick.  Yum.  Even better, there was a (surprise!) dill pickle spear included.  I LOVE PICKLES.   I also got a small pasta salad chock full of veggies and a vinegary dressing, which is a welcome relief from most places that sell pasta salad laden with mayo.  Ew.

And, as it was my first time there, I received a free cookie!  MAN.  That totally made my day.

I'll be back to try more tasty stuff, and probably drag my coworkers and my boyfriend in at some point, as well."}
{"text":"Was looking to try out some new lunch places to break the routine a bit and came upon Wesley's. Service was fast and friendly and the \"west end\" sandwich was somehow even better. The wrap was fresh, filling and delicious. Didn't hurt to get a free cookie for my first trip! All in all would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Wesley's Delicatessen is a great local small business downtown that I recommend supporting. Owned and operated by Wes himself - this shop offers high quality Boar's Head deli meats, delicious homemade soups, and fresh salads. Plus, the customer service is top notch. The staff is very friendly and welcoming to newcomers and regulars. Samples are freely given and highly encouraged.

The lunch combo offers you a sandwich, one side, and a drink. And, if you're a new patron or you check in on Yelp you get a free cookie. All of this for between $8-$12 at lunch."}
{"text":"Chef Wes is down right the most amazing caterer for everything! He has skills and an ethic beyond any expectation. If he created it, made it or suggested it....I'd be game! If you haven't dropped by his deli....make it a point ASAP! He won't disappoint that's for sure!"}
