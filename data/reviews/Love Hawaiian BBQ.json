{"text":"First time try out the kalbi short ribs noodle soup...it very tasty. Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best hawaiian bbq I've had in Phoenix. You can tell the meat was quality and freshly cooked. Everything about the food was perfect, it kind of caught me off guard! The staff is very friendly and Alex made us feel welcome. 10/10 across the board, I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and food was absolutely delicious the potstickers are one of my favorite sides here and the chicken Katsu is so yummy. If you want to try good Hawaiian food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!   Nice and clean but the food was horrible.  Katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken was very fatty.  Salty BBQ beef was also fatty   Rice was mushy and macaroni salad was tasteless.   Vegetables were ok except for a moldy piece of broccoli.   Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Hubby brought home a Hawaiian Plate. It has 2 meat entrees, on top of cabbage, rice and macaroni salad. The two meats he chose were the grilled marinated chicken and the Kalbi short ribs.

The chicken was super popular even though it was dark meat. My son polished the well marinated pieces. He also consumed the rice with it. My son did complain gristle in the chicken.

The Kalbi short ribs were a little dry and did not have much meat on the bones. 

The macaroni salad definitely lacked luster, and after the bed of cabbage was consumed, it was left on our plate. The texture was good, but it seemed under seasoned."}
{"text":"Love Hawaiian BBQ! Love their food, love their open kitchen, everything looks so clean and nice! You don't want to miss it!"}
{"text":"First time visit, food is delicious, portions is really generous, definitely will eat there again."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but the staff the cashier by the name of Anna wow I wanted to slap her she was very rude and looked at my kids like she wanted to squish them you don't ever look at my kids like that. I would be surprised if we go back as long as she is there. This was our first time there and every time we asked her Zoe thing she would just point to the menu and tell us that is what we have. So rude didn't leave me with a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is average.  Had the beef bowl, chicken bowl, and musabi. The bowls didn't have much meat or greens on it. Almost all rice. Tasted ok but nothing to come running back. $8 a bowl is kinda high for what you get. I loved this place when it was the Chinese food."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent price. Clean environment and very nice decoration I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by hear for the first time and really enjoyed the Hawaiian Pork with fresh salad. Everything was fresh and clean and the owner was very nice and hospitable. If you enjoy Hawaiian BBQ, this is the place! Aloha!!"}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! Here is my plate before I devoured it. The bbq sauce is packed on the side."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and pork spare ribs... They both looked like the same meat. Meat was rubbery and fatty. The macaroni salad tasted like it came from Fry's market ( nasty ).
Nothing looked authentic nor tasted authentic. Very disappointed in food. The establishment was clean and smells so good when you enter. I'm scared to go back and be disappointed again due to the quality of the meat and the sides. For the meal costing so much you would think it would taste authentic and good."}
{"text":"Delicious foods at affordable prices. I'd highly recommend the Hawaiian chicken, Kalua pork, and the Kalbi."}
{"text":"This place is great! Super healthy and friendly! I love the owners they are super great"}
{"text":"First time there yesterday my kids and I loved it the bbq steak and chicken was so tender and yummy and the potsickers were delicious!! The place is so clean and the staff has great vibes! Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and the place looks super clean and nice! Will for sure come again!"}
{"text":"This place was super clean. Owner was very very nice and helpful. Food was superb. Ono Hawaiian BBQ has real competition now. My family and I will be regulars here. We live far away but we will be repeat customers. I pray much success for the business.  I wish there was one in Laveen. God bless the owner."}
{"text":"Really expensive for the quality and portion you get. Ohno's has bigger portion and better taste for about the same price."}
{"text":"A very disappointing meal and experience.No \"island\" ambiance and sound system was blasting depressing Adele. 
Every meat choice was either too sweet or too dry. The cabbage was not chopped , mac salad tasteless.
I was going to share my concerns, but nobody was behind the counter. They were laughing in the kitchen . I do not think they were  the owners 
I will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Only things missing were the salt air from local trade winds and sand. Hubz and I lived on Oahu, the food here tasted the same. Thanks for keeping it real. Next time we are in Phoenix, we will visit again. Yummmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. We were headed somewhere else when my wife spotted the sign. So we decided to check it out......

Inside is virtually spotless. But that's just a minor bonus.

Service is awesome. Friendly, fast, and efficient.

Now lets get to the best parts......

  The pot stickers are the best i have had in the 7 years i have been in the valley.
   The fried shrimp was awesome. Very clean flavor, not overwhelmed by the fried oil.
   The pork and chick and a must try.

   But the Manipur is very addictive and something you DON'T want to miss out on.

THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE STOP. DON'T PASS IT UP."}
{"text":"This place is definitely on par with Ono. The staff (owner) is very friendly and ready to answer any questions.

We had the Kahlua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken. The pork was amazing! Not too salty, too fatty or watery, just right. The chicken was very good as well with just enough \"char\" on the edges and as sweet as any teriyaki sauce should be. The mac salad was delicious; not better or worse than Ono, just slightly different, but still creamy and tasty. The rice was perfect, soft and sticky as it should be.

The only negative (when comparing to Ono), the serving sizes were a little less (although, to Love's credit, their scoop of mac salad was far larger than Ono's), but we didn't at all feel like we were ripped off. And, did not leave feeling like we didn't get enough to eat, that's for sure!

FYI...they serve Pepsi products. We're more Coke fans, but it's certainly not a deal-breaker.

You can't go wrong here...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, comparable to Hawaiin BBQ but not as fresh as I experienced there. Customer service was meh, but the cook was very friendly. Would only recommend for a quick lunch while working."}
{"text":"Still on the quest to find other ono Hawaiian BBQ places in Arizona and taste of home. :-( 
We came here on Saturday after doing some Kalikimaka shopping in the area and read the amazing reviews. Ohhh gotta go try this place out since Its on our way home.. Why not? 
Walking in- it wasnt crowded and had a few ppl inside with the touristy Waik?k? decor and the honus - nice! 
Looking at the menu can be a bit confusing because all I wanted was the BBQ chicken plate and I guess Its served as a bowl and I dont care for the cabbage - usually they add that as a filler and living up here, I have a habit of saying \"No cabbage\" not one time, but a few times... Lol! 
And my husband ordered the regular plate lunch of Chicken Katsu and Teri Beef...This is the part I got confused because where this kind of food places has been invented \"Hawaiian BBQ\" plate lunch style - we always get (2) scoops rice, your entrees, and (1) scoop mac/potato salad or cabbage... but, they only serve (1) scoop rice- no can laddat! Lol... I can understand for the continent peeps but, for us born and raise in the islands gotta have a section for us to simplify the menu and cannot say cost cuz back home more expensive .. Hahaha! Just saying!
The food however is AMAZINGLY delicious, the BBQ chicken was sweet and salty but, also tender... and the mac salad was ono - on point with da meaai - no complaints. Ive been too a few places already in AZ and the mac salad was horrahz... 
ohhh and need to train your Cashier what is Soy Sauce or Shoyu? Because when I went to go Look for ketchup/Shoyu (Soy sauce) - she looked or seemed confused in what I was asking for or I could be wrong but, you have to add these items to the condiment area and now, aloha Shoyu company is right in Las Vegas - might be cheaper now for shipping! Lol!
One of the cook understood what I was looking for and I told him \"Gotta have the Shoyu on my rice!\" Lol... he immediately gave me some and some katsu sauce and we was good to go! 
Im Happy there are places up here that serve our local 808 grindz - I do miss our flavored food but, these places will do when im craving to eat plate lunch and too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"The staff is great. The food is great. The price is great. The store is neat. Really nothing to complain at this place. Strongly recommend the chicken katsu and kalua pork. I have been to a few other Hawaiian food places but this restaurant beats them all. My go-to place for Hawaiian food. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The katsu chicken and the kalbi is my favorite. The workers and the owner are very nice and friendly, makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"The food is alright, it's basic and I honestly thing ono Hawaii food is so much better! My katsu chicken was really crispy and crunchy. It's alright food. I was just hungry and stopping by."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Best Hawaiian food in town.  The owner was supper nice.  They actually cook the food right in front of you."}
