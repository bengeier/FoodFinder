{"text":"I never leave any reviews anywhere but this place really made me dig up my yelp account and and post one.  Came here at 7 pm hoping to grab some dinner/food.  The place was absolutely packed and there was no observable line up anywhere.  Staff were in a chaotic mess and had no idea who ordered what.  We tried to order the suckling pig and chicken but they were sold out.  We asked what they had that wasn't sold out and they only said the things in the window.  This place closes at 10 pm but seems to run out of food way before 7 pm.  They only had some pork skewers (2.99 a pop), rotisserie chicken (6.99 per half), and fried chicken (3 pieces for $5).  Ended up getting 4 skewers and 3 pieces of fried chicken to go.  We left and after looking into the bag, we were only given one small piece of a chicken thigh that was over 50% bone.  The whole meal ended up costing almost $20 (for 4 skewers and 1 piece of chicken???) and that is absolutely absurd for what food we got.    The pork skewers were DRY and the chicken was small.  The sauce for the skewers were decent and the spice used on the chicken was good.  Even finding parking in the tiny little lot is a pain.  So you better go park on some side street and walk!  If you come here without knowing what to order, you will be lost.  The menu is unfriendly to those who don't know what lechon is or what pork and chicken is in Filipino.  In addition, they don't have any sign of what is sold out or not.  They also don't take credit card apparently, so bring cash or debit.  Overall, come early if you want to avoid the line and actually get some non sold out food."}
{"text":"VERY BAD SERVICE FROM STAFF AND WILL WASTE YOUR TIME.  Brought my wife and 2.5-year-old daughter to this restaurant this evening for dinner around 7:10 PM.  Queued up for more than 20 minutes, the cashier took the order around 7:39 PM (Paid for it), waited after an hour and half of the order was still not available! Escalated to the new cashier on duty and they mentioned they gave the other half of my order to another customer!  Waited for another 30 minutes then finally got the second half of my order.  The manager/owner was apologetic and refunded the part of the order.  Looks like a really mismanaged restaurant.  Apart from the questionable cleanliness, the staff looks like they are all over the place. Avoid eating here if you value your time!"}
{"text":"I will give this place three stars because they need to develop a good system when serving customers. We arrived here around 2pm, and they did not have a lot of things cooked. Also, they also were very disorganized when trying to serve us.   Their lechon saved them though because it was very delicious. I believe this was as close to as \"Cebu-Style\" lechon you can get. Yes its pretty salty, but that's how it is in Cebu. It was so tasty.  I'd give this place more time and I am sure they will be better when it comes to service."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for their lechon. When we got there, we were warmly greeted by the staff. As we survey the food station (All of the food is warmed in a steam table) the roasted pig was almost non-existent. We asked when will they have another one available, they said not until 6pm. We got there around 4pm. So, instead of having scraps of lechon and not wanting to wait for a fresh one, we decided to order combo 4 which is: 1/2 roasted chicken, with lumpia, steamed rice and pop. We also ordered sisig. We were eating for 2, so we ordered an extra bowl of steam rice. I asked if they had garlic fried rice, but they didn't. Would've been nice if they had that option. The pork belly caught our attention, as that would've been a great alternative, but they admitted that it was made yesterday and for $2 cheaper (From $12 to $10). I respect them for their honesty, but no way am I eating pork belly that was made yesterday. As we're seated, waiting for our food, there's Christian music playing from the TV. It was a little loud for our liking, especially since their dining area is right by the TV. As we dig into our food, we're disappointed because everything was barely warm. The sisig was rubbery, because it was laying in a steam table for who knows how long. Sisig should be fresh, made to order, or else it won't be the same. The chicken was barely tolerable. I drenched everything in Man Tomas sauce and spicy vinegar to make it better. Overall, a disappointment. I'd only come back if we're lucky enough to make it there when they have fresh lechon and pork belly that wasn't made the day before. Sampaguita Village literally across the street is better for Filipino food."}
{"text":"The lechon is moist flavourfull and skin crispy. Will be back to try the other food. You can see the chef's roasting the pigs right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"There were a lot of people there. Ordered the Lechon Liempo takeout. Cashier said 10 minutes of wait but didn't come for 30 minutes. I then said something and then got my food right after. Food was great and they cooked the meat outside of the store. They also forgot the sauce. So I am not entirely sure if I will make another visit."}
{"text":"I love it! Lechon  is just a word in which basically means the way food is cooked over an open fire pit.  Technically anything can be lechon. (chicken for example) This place has a small sit down area and is generally more of a pick up and go kind of place. However, I was in it for a dine in.   So my boyfriend and I ordered a pound of the lechon baboy, and the grilled tilapia. We were served a soup and some steamed rice to go with our meal. We were also given 2 sauces to go with the lechon. One was a little more sweet, and the other was a soy sauce based mixture. Everything was so tasty and there is so much on the menu that I want to try like the crispy pata or the liempo (ribs). The best part of our meal though? It has got to be the skin. Oh man oh man, that crispy skin is something else. I also loved how friendly everyone was. You walk in and you just feel welcomed right away.  I highly recommend anyone who is a huge carnivore to come here and try how they make the lechon.  Also from BlogTO and thestar.com , the writers mentioned that Wilson's Haus specializes in suckling pig too. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had a very laid back dining experience here. It's hard not to when the place is so casual, but arriving late meant that I didn't partake in ordering, and having the baby with me also meant that I wasn't completely focused on eating and had to leave early. Fortunately, I was meeting up with a Filipino friend who I trusted in ordering the food and I'd say he made some good choices. We had a simple chicken stir fry (very homey and tasty), a rice noodle dish (I think it's called pancit? I loved it), half a rotisserie chicken (juicy, tender, though the skin wasn't crispy), and of course, the pork lechon, which is grilled right outside the restaurant - I just love that charcoal grill smell! My friend said that they do lechon the right way here by using the correct spices/seasonings. I wouldn't know but it was tasty.   You can also get take-out, which seemed to be very popular. I was seriously considering taking home a slab of lechon pork belly ($12)... The restaurant is set up so that there is the take-out/ordering counter with some ready-made food on one side, and another room off of it (that was obviously part of an expansion from the counter side) that fits maybe 25-30 people at casual tables and chairs (seat yourself). They are kid/family-friendly and have high chairs. I will note that it is not baby-friendly in that there is only one bathroom without a change table. The restaurant is in a small strip mall with parking right along the storefront but because there are other businesses (including another lechon place I think), it's hard to find parking. There is street parking on the side though. Oh, one other drawback - I don't think they are licensed to sell alcohol. And I'm fairly certain they don't take reservations since it's such a small place. I'd love to come back to try some other fares but it's a bit far from home for me so I probably won't have the chance to."}
{"text":"Never picks up the phone and never have enough menu items in stock. They also close whenever they want and do not give any indication as to why they are closed when they are supposed to be open as stated online. Total waste of my time."}
{"text":"Im from Cebu and I know what real Cebu lechon baboy taste like. Flavour is there but  it needs more salt and more Cebu flavour. The lechon skin is not crispy anymore. Nevertheless, its better than any lechon I have tasted in Toronto. Lechon manok is a different story. Like the other reviews, it is delish and taste like back home. We ordered 1 pound lechon ($15.99), 1 kawali ($9.99), 1 lechon manok ($12.99), 1 bbq pork skewer ($2.99) and 3 rice ($4.50) and 3 clear soup (free). I paid $56 including tax and tip. Not much vegetable option.  Would love if they sell fresh lumpia to compliment their food (hint hint). Will I come back? Maybe once a year of cholesterol overload is good enough. Staff were  friendly and accommodating.  If management is reading this, plesse Seasoned the lechon baboy with more salt."}
{"text":"Instagram got me curious about this place so a group of us had to check it out. Its this small place on the south west side of Bathurst and Wilson. At first look it seems very unassuming, like your average Filipino eatery and then the smell of lechon hits you. Oh man. I was transported back to the restaurants from back home that just specialized in lechon baboy. The smell is what I hope heaven will smell like.  Now we already had high exectations because there was so much hype about this place already but the food did not let us down. The lechon was juicy and delicious. And the skin... Omg the skin. Salty and crunchy. I just had to close my eyes and appreciate how amazing it all tasted. Not to be outdone are their lechon manok and lumpia. Both outstanding dishes. The servers were all so friendly. It was an overall enjoyable experience. I am already planning on coming back."}
