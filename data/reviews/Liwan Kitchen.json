{"text":"New rice roll and congee place in town!  Honestly it doesn't look too new. I thought it has been around for years since they didn't renovate it after they took over Congee Wong.  We came at around 11:30am on a Sunday and it was almost empty. We ordered 2 congees, 2 rice rolls, and 1 casserole rice. It took a long time for the food to come. I understand that the casserole rice would take longer but the congee and rice rolls took over half an hour to come.   The congee was good. We ordered one Liwan style and one fresh fish and pork blood congee. There's lots of toppings in the Liwan style one. The fish and pork blood congee was kind of different than other places. The pork blood was sliced instead of cubed which made it more flavourful. The spoon is not the best for congee as it is very deep and long. Not very suitable for eating congee.  The rice rolls were very silky and thick. I've never had such thick rice rolls. The plates were too small as there's not enough space to dip the rolls in the soy sauce.  The rice casserole came with a bowl of soup (both not pictured). It looks like there's a lot of meat but in reality the pieces are very tiny. There's also crispy rice on the bottom that is completely edible. At other places, the rice tends to stick to the bottom and it is almost impossible to remove.  The service was okay. The waitresses are very friendly. But when we asked for the bill, it took them three tries to give us the right one. First, they gave it to the table beside us. Then they gave us one that was $60 (clearly not ours). Finally, they gave us the right one."}
{"text":"Tried Liwan Kitchen when it first opened a few months back. They took over the previous restaurant which was also a congee place.   Food 2.5/5 We ordered the Liwan style congee, fried dough sticks and pork and chives rice rolls. I originally wanted to try a fish congee but they hadn't received their delivery yet at noon. Congee was fairly loaded with ingredients however my only complaint is the overload of ginger slices and cheaper ingredients like pork balls. The rice roll was okay, the pork used wasn't fatty so the meat wasn't as tender. The actual rice roll itself wasn't silky smooth like Sam's Delight (my fave) but it was still soft and a little chewy. My least favourite thing to eat however was the dough fritters. Although it was crunchy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, it had a weird oil taste. Hard to describe but almost as if it was fried in old oil.   Service n/a Can't say much as I work fairly close to the area and ordered takeout instead. While waiting I did notice that there were a fair number of staff waiting on the tables. They missed an order for a casserole rice and although the patrons complained they seemed very apologetic.  This place has been open for a few months and I haven't had any urge to go back or try new items. Food was average, nothing to write home about. Perhaps I'll make another visit if I'm sick and craving congee."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp as I was looking for a place to dine. Ordered a rice pot with minced pork and eel and a rice noodle with shrimps and beef.  The rice Noodle with Shrimps and Beef (score 4/5) The rice noodle is really thin and smooth. The presentation of it looks very good. The beef is well marinated and tasted good. But there are only two shrimps in the rice noodles. Next time, I will order plain rice noodle instead or just rice noodle with shrimps.  A Rice Pot with Minced Pork and Eel (score 4/5) The rice is chewy. It seems to me the greens on top of the rice has some Lychee flavour. The minced pork is tender (don't know how to describe it, it seems like a lot of flour is added to the minced pork to make it taste tender) and the eel is tasty but there are only two tiny pieces of eel on top of the minced pork.   I think I will come back for rice noodles!"}
{"text":"A new addition to the growing \"congee and rice noodle\" scene in Toronto, liwan kitchen has all the typical Cantonese favourites.   I cannot say anything about their congee or rice roll because my mission here was for their Clapypot rice. Clapypot rice is a Cantonese classic enjoyed all year round especially during the colder season. It is rice cooked in a Clapypot with a variety of toppings added on top  but what is beautiful about this dish is the crispy rice bottom that is produce from cooking it at a high temperature.  I chose the mince pork Patty with salted fish (a favourite of mine) and the flavor was spot on. My only dislike is that the bottom was not charred enough to give it a crispy rice bottom as well as the portion being abit smaller than others (compared to green bamboo up the road). I can't say it's the best place for claypot rice in Scarborough but it's a good place if you want to order other Cantonese favourites on the side such as rice rolls or congee. Portion sizes could be bigger for the price they're charging but other than that, give it a try!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I'll round it up cause it's a newer place.  We got the eel and pork rice casserole, a vegetarian rice roll and a beef brisket ho fun. All of these items came down to roughly $25 including tax.   The casserole took longer to create, but the other dishes did take a little longer than most restaurants to come out. The rice roll tasted really good when it was nice and hot. I would prefer it a little more if it had a more flavourful tofu and more greens included in the wrap though.   The beef brisket ho fun was standard, the bowl was a little small, but it actually had enough ho fun in it if you keep eating your way through. The beef brisket was moderate in terms of tenderness. I do however appreciate that it had a nice broth which lasted a decent amount of time. The ho fun were also fresh, so I know they didn't use dried ones that were stored for a long period of time.   The casserole took the longest. There were only three small pieces of eel on this, but what I really liked was how hot the rice was even when we were close to finishing the meal. The casserole came with soup which allowed you to eat the leftovers that were stuck on the pot after your finish the majority of the rice. The pork meat was quite delicious and added a bit of flavour to the rice."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pork and Chives and my husband ordered the Coriander& BBQ Pork rice noodles.    It  was quite good, however the wait staff could have been a bit more friendlier."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place with my parents a couple weeks ago. If you're familiar with the restaurant before them, Liwan Kitchen has changed their entrance so its directly next to Beef Noodle Restaurant next door.   We ordered the Preserved Meat and Chicken on Rice casserole, Fried Dough Stick w/ Plain Rice Noodle Roll & the Pig Kidney and Liver congee (not pictured).   Rice: really enjoyed the crunchy pieces of rice stuck to the casserole dish, some places the rice is just dry and hard but this had a nice crisp to it   Rice Noodle Roll: dough was nice and crunchy and the rice noodle roll was thin, only issue was the hoisin/sesame paste sauce they gave us had a thick layer of oil on top so it made the whole piece oily when dipped   Congee: good flavour and perfect consistency IMO"}
{"text":"Liwan has given my old favorite congee and rice roll place a run for it's money. They make great Cantonese style congee with good portions, the rice rolls are made fresh and the service is great. They beat out my old favorite because the environment is more upscale, cleaner, and you can sit more comfortably.  I usually get the congee and rice roll but they also do traditional dinner dishes also. We recommended this place to a discerning uncle and it's become his favorite congee place because the pig-liver congee is of a much better quality."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 $6.99 combo (congee + rice noddle), 1 eel and pork rice casserole, 1 chow mein, 1 rice noodle with fried dough stick & 1 fried dough stick (sweet and salty one each) came to $60.   The chow mein portion was crazy big especially for the price. Rice noodle was perfectly made!   Everything tasted great. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered take outs. The rice roll is very good.I love the texture .  And the preserved egg congee had a lot of meat. Great place. I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"2.5 star (rounded up to 3 due to this place is relatively new)  Liwan Kitchen is another Rice Roll, Congee and Casserole Rice Point joint that opens in the area.  Interior is quite spacious as it used to be Congee King and Liwan just took over with minimum remodeling.  Casserole Rice comes with a side soup and it takes 20 minutes prep time. Calling ahead is an option to minimize wait time.  Mushroom and Chicken Rice ($8.59) served in this cute one person portion hoyt pot. I hope you like rice as meat vs rice ratio is low. The pot did heat up quite well as there was a layer of crispy rice at the bottom. The soy sauce served on the side was room temperature. Chicken tasted bland and the rice lacked the infused flavours from the meat/mushrooms. The soup that came complimentary though was not the double boiled soup that usually comes with competitors.   Rice Rolls at around $4 and up was so so. The wrapping itself was decent but the stuffed meat quality was poor. I might opt for the plain ones.  Breakfast Specials till 11 am for $6.99 with a choice of rice roll/noodle + Congee sounds like a decent deal.  Service is homey and welcoming. Might not be my first choice in the neighborhood but if you have the rice roll cravings, Liwan is not too bad.  ** MSG level Alert: HIGH ** I did get extremely thirsty and dry mouth a hour or so after my dinner. Please be aware if you are allergic to MSG."}
{"text":"Variable choices of food, original traditional Canton gourment. Good prices, good service. Can see the owner is dilligently introducing quality with competitive price to tje public. Worth to try."}
