{"text":"Best vegan food I have ever had. My whole family loved the chicken pot pie and sweet potato pie. They were amazing. Very flavorful. The pie crusts were flaky and tasty-a big accomplishment without butter or egg."}
{"text":"I failed as a yelper for not taking photos. The food was amaaaaazing.   I had the vegan fried fish & gumbo with rice. It was just perfect. The \"fish\" was crispy seasoned so well and even had great mouth feel. She somehow had seaweed attached that really gave you the fish essence. The gumbo was incredibly textured like a meat gumbo would be. I can't tell you exactly what was used but there was a veggie in there with the texture of chicken, sausage, shrimp, and crab. The roux was thick and great.  What they are doing with vegan food is straight up soulful. I will be ordering meals online. FYI they don't have a physical location."}
{"text":"First tried Mo Bites at the Cleveland State Veg Fest...the nachos are the bomb! As a birthday gift to the vegan fiance, decided to order some of his catering. The vegan mac & cheese was my favorite. One person can finish off an entire pound (that sounds so gross but its true! a pound doesn't seem that much when it comes to mac & cheese!). The gyros were good too, and the general tso's was tasty, but didn't really resemble what I think of as general tsos. Almost seemed like a cross between general tso's and thanksgiving stuffing. My coworkers thought the leftovers smelled amazing though!"}
