{"text":"I rarely have the opportunity to visit the NW or the NE to explore the Chinese restuarants up there, but my family and I have experienced our share of Chinese restaurants in the south end. My father is happy to eat anything, my mother judges a restaurant by how salty and oily their food is (the more bland and less oily, the better), and I was raised to not ask questions, but to eat whatever was in front of me.  This little restaurant looked like a typical Chinese restaurant you will find in Calgary. Outdated interiors, fake plants, and a few random caucasian folks.  My Cantonese is quite poor, but I was able to understand a little bit of what my parents ordered. We ordered ling cod, stiry-fry pork belly, salt and pepper seafood, sweet and sour pork, some kind of vegetables with pickled eggs and as per usual, \"little salt, little oil.\"  They started us off with a broth-type soup. I could taste the MSG in it. Not my favourite. The pork belly was good. The ling cod was a little chewy. The rest of the dishes were quite tasty. The tastiness of the salt and pepper squid always has a huge factor in my satisfaction rating. Theirs was delicious. They cut up the squid to one-bite pieces so I didn't have to shove a huge piece in my mouth and it was cooked perfectly. I was pleased.  We received decent service, some of the food was good, some was not so good, the restrooms were cleaner than I expected. The reason why I'm only giving this place a 3 stars is because nothing wowed me. If I was able to give it a 3.5, I would."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! We've been to the Chinese Village several times before and quite enjoyed it. The food was hot & fresh; the Almond Chicken was delicious. This time the food was absolutely awful! We ordered the exact same thing as before, it tasted old, like it was recycled from the lunch buffet! It was luke warm & I think the Almond Chicken was re deep-fried! They gave us a 15% discount so I felt obligated to tip. Not a very enjoyable or appetizing exp this time."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet. Small but has all the essentials. I go every 2 weeks for their lunch take out. Can't beat 11$ for a huge container of food that you pick yourself."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and was content with the experience overall. Did the dine in buffet for 13.95 a plate and liked the fact that they sat us with people that were strangers to us and were already enjoying their meals. The restaurant was quite busy, so it was better than being turned away, or having to wait for an entire table to open up. It kind of made me feel like I was actually in China for a minute. Next time I'd probably get the takeout box because all I could eat was one full plate but there likely won't be a next time, because I'm moving to Montreal."}
{"text":"It's called ??? (Lu Fu Lou) now. Was there for lunch with a group of coworkers on Friday Feb 5, 2016.  The female boss appeared to be very impatient and rude.  I don't think she's suitable to be either a manager or a customer service professional.  I look down at her.  Besides the terrible customer service, my Canadian coworkers said the food was not good either."}
{"text":"It's not that great... but you know what? That's ok! They have a buffet and a great location. I've eaten here once having ordered a beef hot pot stew. The second time was when I passed by at 2 PM and stopped in for the lunchbox. The entire buffet had been pillaged but I somehow filled my take away box, for half price! Want amazing Chinese food? Go to Chinatown. Want mediocre Chinese food? Go to Chinese Village. At least you won't have to nudge past hundreds of other smelly c-train riders during the heat of summer while trying to snag Calgary's claim to fame, ginger beef, and a mountain of spring rolls."}
{"text":"Food was great and in very large portions, its tradition northern style chinese food, and lots of dishes what hongkong/southern style chinese restaurants dont offer. It is hard to find a good northern chinese restaurant.  Things to improve: Service was good but not memorable. The interior seems old.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"It's a classic hole in the you know what, but it's still traditional, brings back the 80's in a way lol.  For sure it's catered towards the western market but having said that, when I do get a craving for lemon chicken, this would be something to drop by.  And also helps that the parking meter machine is right in front of it.  I'm tired of chasing down these creatures several times a day today lol.  But the owner's nice, working out on some catering deals for clients.  A bonus, in fact, a huge bonus, that they have a fax machine, in this day and age!  It's a medium-sized restaurant with about 10 tables.  A perfect occasion would be for my hockey team to come here to celebrate with a hearty meal, but probably not date worthy.  At least it's casual here.  They deliver."}
{"text":"We got take out from this place while we were visiting the city & they gave us a ton of food! We ordered about 5 dishes but the containers were bursting they were so full. The food quality was good. Nothing really special but just simple Chinese food. We actually couldn't finish all the food & didn't want to waste it as we were going on a tour the next day. Anyway, after dinner hubby went out & gave the food to homeless people. The only thing I can complain about was the fortune cookies were stale. I went to eat one & had to spit it out."}
{"text":"Rob & I live fairly close to here, so every now & again we walk up the street and go there on a nice day. The service staff are very friendly & accomodating, with lots of smiles along the way (of course it could be gas. Just kidding). The last I remember visiting there, they offered both a buffet and singular menu items. The decor is simplistic but classy. White paper tablecloths and lilac-colored walls. I noticed the bathrooms are a fair distance in the back, through one set of doors and then another, They are slightly creepy only because they seem so isolated from the rest of the place.  The prices are standard for Chinese food. Totally haven't been in a long time now, though we understand they have been new management for awhile now and more 'Chinese' than before. We may go check it out again someday."}
{"text":"It's your typical Western Chinese Buffet.  I went there for my first time on Friday.  The restaurant is fairly small yet fills quickly.  Some people eat in the restaurant; others do takeout with the lunch boxes.  The food had the usual fried rice, 3 types of noodles, salt and pepper squid, salt and pepper shrimp, brocolli and beef, deep fried chicken, bbq pork (really good!), ginger beef, and lots more.  If you're trying to lose weight, don't go here!    The other thing I didn't like about the restaurant is you come out of the restaurant smelling like it!  Eww!"}
