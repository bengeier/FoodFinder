{"text":"I love these tacos. The meats aren't very consistent - sometimes they're very salty, sometimes they're perfectly seasoned. But I love the corn tortilla and being able to add my own toppings. I love that it's so quick and affordable too! ($2.50 per taco)."}
{"text":"Tacos are so good here, great prices, and I love how they serve right on the street. It makes the experience more fun and charming. I haven't been back since I became vegetarian and I have really missed it, but now I see that you can get tacos with potatoes. I will have to try that (or will stop being a vegetarian for some meals just so I can eat the tacos again)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and for cheap too!! We ordered four tacos ($10): two chicken and two lamb. The meat was a little dry, but you were able to add various sauces that added to the flavor."}
{"text":"mmmm street tacos!!!!  We came here to buy some groceries to make chicken tortilla soup and some quesadillas.  They have a good selection and all the produce looks pretty fresh.  Considering how small the space is, they sure did pack in a lot of inventory!!  They take credit card, there's a reasonable amount of street parking, they carry all the standard supplies, the prices are reasonable, and did I mention the STREET TACOS :D!  Seriously, the street tacos are yummmmy!!  They're definitely bigger portions than the typical street tacos, but I' won't complain :)  They didn't have my go-to Al Pastor meat, but their carnitas were really good!  Definitely going to be making more trips to Las Palmas!"}
{"text":"BOMB DIGGITY  These tacos are the best I've found in Pittsburgh so far and easily the most authentic. I always order whatever meat they're currently grilling and have yet to be dissapointed. The bar of accoutrements is impressive and there's an aesthetic to stuffing a taco into your face in the middle of a dirty sidewalk while chugging a half liter of mango jarritos."}
{"text":"Really dirty place. It's right on the street, and I'd be concerned about food safety. Not really worth the money you save."}
{"text":"Great! Corrections: they are open til 9pm on Sunday. have fish tacos on Fridays during the Lenten season."}
{"text":"If you love authentic tacos, Las Palmas is the best-kept secret in all of Pittsburgh. It's actually a taco stand in front of a tiny, genuine Mexican grocery on Atwood Street. The tacos are $2.50 each and probably the best you'll find in a city that is not known for its Mexican cuisine. You can pile on as many toppings as you want. For a sweet treat, pick up some flan or tres leches cake in the store. Delicious! My only complaint is there's nowhere to sit, so you've got to either take the food home, walk over to Schenley Park, or eat it awkwardly while walking down the street. These tacos are so mouth-watering as to make the last option seem reasonable, so be careful -- especially with the hot sauce."}
{"text":"I've been attending Pitt for 4 years now and nothing makes me feel more love for South Oakland than Las Palmas.  The guys that work the taco stand are really nice guys. I get acknowledged any time I walk by. For $2 a taco, you can't beat it. I'll never look at taco Tuesday at Quedoba the same. Rib eye is def the best quality option for your money, but if u order chicken of chorizo your gonna get a taco very full of meat. I never have to order more than 3 and I'm always full.  The avocado sauce(not sure of its real name) and pico goes on each of my tacos. Sometimes I use a small amount of the yellowish ghost pepper salsa but not always.  Plus glass bottle Mexican Coke, pretty sure it's real sugar Coke and not high fructose corn syrup."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my experience after reading all the positive reviews. There was a piece of a hot dog in my taco which really freaked me out....is this normal? I'm not sure but I'm hesitant to return to Las Palmas."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh. Get one of carnitas and one of lomo+chorizo. Put some avocado-based green salsa, lime, onion and cilantro. If brave, try the habanero salsa. Pair with a Jarritos, Sangria or Apple soda. Then prepare for taco heaven."}
{"text":"Fam stay away from this place. First bite is awesome gonna grant you that. But shit got me going to the bathroom like crazy son. Both my sisters are married to Mexicans so I am used to Mexican food, I myself am latin american. But nigga there was something wrong with them cecina tacos. For real, eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh, hands down. And I love the ambiance (nothing like eating amazing, authentic tacos while sitting on a curb)."}
{"text":"Really nice cheap food within walk of Carnegie Mellon and Pitt campus!!    These street tacos are served at the front of the Mexican grocery store. All of the tacos are $2 (not dirt cheap but they give you a nice-sized taco and lots of fixings).   The guy is continually cooking the meat on the grill in front of you while he pumps out tacos and the meat is really fresh. Tacos are served in two corn tortillas, which he also grills right in front of you. I highly endorse the ribeye steak taco--- a slab of beef instead of more traditional chopped-up meat, with really great flavor. The chorizo taco is pretty good also.  Even better, you put on your own toppings-- fresh pico, avocado-tomatillo salsa, red hot salsa, cilantro, onions, etc...  I loved this place and would go here really often if I lived in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"The BEST authentic Mexican food that I have found so far in Pittsburgh. They bumped the price of the tacos up from $2 to $2.50,  but it's well worth the extra .50. The staff has never been anything but friendly both inside and outside the store and they are willing to help with any questions you might have. For $5 you can get two filling tacos with a variety of meat choices including steak, shredded pork, chorizo, chicken, and ground beef. Be sure to ask for the freshly grilled corn tortillas to avoid any of the older tougher ones (which has only happened to me once). There is a toppings bar off to the side where you can pick from several standard toppings, which include: 3 types of salsa (I advise avoiding the deep red unless you chew on habanero peppers on a daily basis), guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, etc. There can be a short wait which can be avoided by not going between 12-2PM on the weekdays. Inside they sell great Mexican sodas and snacks. I would recommend eating the tacos immediately so that the yummy sauces don't make the tortilla soggy, but if you can't I've had them put the meat on the side of the tortillas so that I can eat it when I get home without worrying. No matter what time I go it's always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious and effortless. As a university student, getting my lunch dinner in $4 is a sweet deal."}
{"text":"Two dollar authentic tacos seven days a week with excellent toppings.  It's simple, cheap, and delicious."}
{"text":"Can we talk about how good these Tacos were?  I mean, seriously, just for a second?  Ok. Here's the skinny - You go into the Las Palmas Mexican Market, where you pay $2.50 per taco and hope they understand enough of you English to complete the transaction. You then come out to the street and get said taco(s). You then top them at the toppings bar (that was amazing), afterwards you ascend to a higher plane of taco existence.  On a crowded street in Pittsburgh. A sunny Sunday afternoon. Standing around a tree. This was the environment in which I had the best taco I have pretty much ever had. It was perfect though and through. i had one chicken and peppers, the other steak peppers and onions. They were perfect. I will be going back many more times.  I totally took the YELPers' collective advice on this one and was not disappointed. If you like eating amazing tacos on a sidewalk, its 5/5 - would taco again."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find better tacos in Pittsburgh than in Manhattan. Although they still weren't as good as some of the ones I've had out west, these were amazing. I love their condiments bar. I tried all the different meats they offered and my favorite was the carnitas."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Pittsburgh.  This is also the only non tex-mex Mexican food I have been able to find while I've been in Pittsburgh.  There are various kinds of meat: steak with onion, lengua (beef tongue), chorizo (Mexican spicy sausage), chicken, ribeye, etc. Occasionally there are vegetarian tacos, but I haven't tried them yet! I heard they are good though.  Seeing the storefront of Las Palmas was like being transported briefly back to my dearly missed home state of California. I've been there three times in the past week to get a taste of home.  The people are friendly and the tacos are large. You can't beat a $2 delicious taco."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the tacos here because of all the great reviews. At the same time, I was worried I'd set my expectations too high and would be disappointed. I am happy to say that I suffered no disappointment.  I paid my $2.50 for a taco inside the grocery store, then returned outside. I did not experience any language barriers. After I chose my meat, the man placed a tortilla in the box and added a generous amount of carnitas. (Other choices included chorizo and chicken.) I saw him warming tortillas as I entered the store; the meat was already cooked. I then took my taco to the condiment station and added tomatoes, pico de gallo, cilantro, and guacamole. My spice tolerance is really low so I didn't try any of the salsas. I then walked for about five minutes before I ate, so the food wasn't hot.  The tortilla alone is just a little crispy, thick, and delicious. The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful. There was a lot, especially considering the price. Usually, that wouldn't be a pro for me, but at the condiments bar, I was able to add a lot of vegetables, which really helped balance out the meatiness. Everything was fresh, and the guacamole was good as well. The pico de gallo was a little spicy (just bearable for me if I ate it along with everything else), and I actually enjoyed the kick it lent the taco (I usually avoid spice). Next time, I'll probably try some of the salsas. I also want to try the taco as soon as I add the toppings, when it's really warm. The tacos are a pretty great deal--I'd say two or three would do for a meal.   I also took a quick look around the grocery store. It's small and really cramped. They have a lot of pantry items, some produce, and some bread."}
{"text":"best place in Pittsburgh.  The outside taco stand is the best, can't even describe how sick it is.  Unreal.  The food in the grocery store is so cheap and the produce is really fresh and about a quarter of the price of Giant Eagle.  There is no reason not to eat at this place or shop there all the time.  I probably go about 4 times a week just for tacos (granted its only a 10 minute drive).   Tacos are 2 dollars each toppings are free (4-5 salsas, 3-4 hot sauces, guac, pickled radish, other stuff).  They are usually open from 1-9 daily from what I have seen."}
{"text":"Ummmmmm, the best. There aren't a lot of options for tacos in Pittsburgh, and both Las Palmas locations are incredible. Very generous portions of meat, and awesome sauce and toppings options."}
{"text":"This place has legit street tacos. It's very similar to the stand in front of Reyna's. It is a small stand in front of a Mexican grocery. They have 6 different meats to choose from. We had the pulled pork, the chorizo, and the Carne Asada. All were excellent. They have a toppings bar with the usual street taco fare- fresh onions, cilantro, and 6 different salsas and pico. One of the salsa's had pomplano and was very tasty. If in Oakland on weekends, do yourself a favor and hit this stand.  Only open on weekends. FYI- They don't have any seating. Most of the clientele are locals like me who walk home to eat. But there are always a few apartments on Atwood for rent with steps out front that you can sit real quick and eat on the steps. No one bothers you. It's a laid- back, college vibe in this area. Cash only. Prices: $2.50/ taco but when you see the size of them you will understand.  Parking tip: if Atwood has no parking, try one street over (Meyran) or York St."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Although I'm biased towards these little \"hole in the wall\" type eateries, you really can't beat the taste or the price of Las Palmas. Up until a few weeks ago, I thought Reyna's in the Strip District was the best. But I gotta say, there's something about the corn tortillas that makes the taco taste so good. Like others have mentioned, it's just a little food stand run by nice people in front of a mexican grocery store. You can get pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, and chorizo followed by some toppings of your choice. I like onion, cilantro, guac, and one of their hot sauces. Ain't nothing fancy, but go for a taco and a jarritos soda, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"First time I came here, ordering was a bit confusing, but I couldn't care less because everyone said this place was amazing. I bought a few steak tacos and they were quite authentic. The price was very good too. Las Palmas is probably a spot I'll be hitting up numerous times in the future. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Pittsburgh. My wife and I have been on a multiyear quest to locate the best tacos, and this is it. Search no further. You have to eat them on the street but that does not diminish their perfection. Las Palmas has another location in Brookline that is equally as good."}
{"text":"my bf and I moved here from southern CA years ago and he stumbled upon this hidden gem in Oakland! love the market it has EVERYTHING! not to mention this food stand is AMAZING at $2/taco you can't beat it! there's a stand filled with plenty of condiments to choose from so PILE HIGH!"}
{"text":"Took at walk here for lunch with a few of my co-workers.  I would have never found this place on my own.  Its off the beaten path.  I ordered 2 tacos, one beef and one chicken.  I liked the beef one, very flavorful.  Although I did get some gristle in it.  The chicken one was just meh.  I would not order that one again.  These tacos are more authentic that what you think of from most of the Tex-mex joints around here.  Served with 2 tortillas and a large portion of meat.  There is no cheese in traditional tacos so you won't find any shredded jack cheese here.  The things you can add are mainly just chunky salsas and sauces that you can cram your taco full.  This is a 'hunch' kind of meal.  No seats since its street food.  Just gotta find a spot to hunch over your food and try not to let the mess from your overly filled taco hit your shirt.  I will re-review again later and only get the beef next time.  I must have just had an unlucky taco since none of my co-workers seemed to get gristle in theirs.  I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"I love coming here after a long day of classes and getting tacos. They are cheap and delicious!   I just wish people would respect the sanitation of the taco condiment stand more. I was there yesterday and there were two women reaching into the cilantro and limes with their bare hands.   The store smells a little \"eh\", so I don't really get any produce when I'm in there but I do get a lot of nonperishables from their store.   I've never gotten food poisoning from their food, despite what others have experienced."}
{"text":"OK!  Here's the skinny. These are my favorite tacos in town. They provide you with two corn tortillas and your choice of meat and from there you have the ability to select toppings from the topping bar including: habenero sauce, red sauce, green sauce, an avacado sauce, pico de gayo, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lime.  The meat changes daily and typical consists of ribeye, chicken, beef, chili pork or chorizo.   There really isn't anywhere to eat, but you can always pop a squat on one of the many door stoops right there on Atwood Street. I've done it many times without any complaints so far. Just watch out for broken glass on the street!"}
{"text":"Fucking authentic to the 9's.  After being dragged to a variety of \"Mexican\" food places by various people here and being horrified by the so called \"Mexican Food\" and the disgustingly low quality salsa--I came across this place and now I can say that I. AM.  HAPPY.    I remember a few weeks I went into Mad Mex and asked for their spiciest salsa.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 3.  :(  Yinzers aren't much into spicy food.  Everything here is either bland or toned down to meet the boring tastes of the locals.    But Las Palmas--they are authentic.  You can tell by the Mexican music and the real Mexican people that work there.  Not a single gringo working there.  I got a drink and paid for a couple of tacos inside before walking back out to get my street food.    2.50 per taco, unlimited toppings at the salsa bar.    I asked the guy what the spiciest salsas were and he pointed me towards the orange (haberno) and red(some kind of hot pepper).  I slathered my tacos in the salsas, liberally applied pico, grabbed a few limes and a grilled pepper.  Then I walked down the road to enjoy my lunch.  What happened next was mouth blowing.   I placed the taco in my mouth and took a bite.  Sheer pleasure.  After all the crappy Mexican food I've had here, this was a revelation.  The zing of the onions, the softness of the corn tortillas, the kick of the salsas.  I took another bite.  I was in heaven for a few seconds.   Until my mouth exploded in FIRE and went to straight to hell.  Holy Jesus!  If Satan made a salsa, the habenero would be it.  It was so sinful.  My face started to burn up and snot began to drip uncontrollably out my nostrils.  I must have looked like a disaster.  I polished off my first taco but had to pick at my second because I was hyperventilating like no ones business.  I downed my Jumex juice in a matter of seconds and then sprinted to the nearest store to buy a much needed bottle of water.  OMG OMG OMG.  So much pain and pleasure at the same time.    On a scale of 1 to 10, habenero salsa here is a 9.3.  Hopefully I do not diarreah later tonight."}
{"text":"I have eaten street tacos all over the U.S. and these were the BEST I've ever had. The authenticity of getting them on the street just added that much more to the experience. I won't mark them down but I wish they had cold Diet Coke. If I ever come back to Pittsburg, this will be number one on my list of places to eat!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh. That I've found anyways. Coming from Los Angeles, from time to time, I get a major craving for a good taco.   Las Palmas has everything from chicken to beef to barbacoa and I'm probably missing some options. It's $2.50 for a taco. $2.50?!?!?! Do you realize how ridiculous that is??? You walk up to the grill on the sidewalk and tell them what kind of meat you want. They then take raw meat, slap it on the grill, cook it in front of you, and then hand it to you in a corn tortilla. You then have the option of slathering as many different toppings on the tacos as you please.   I would say a meal is 2 tacos and they have really cool drinks inside to choose from. From coconut juice to various kinds of Mexican sodas.    As a student, I walked. And I can see it being a bit hard to find parking around there.   Las Palmas is my little piece of Los Angeles.   (Plus there's a great Mexican grocery store that has tons of stuff. I like to indulge in the sugar coated mangoes and papayas...)"}
{"text":"AMAZING Tacos. Go there and get ready for some real time tacos. Sauces are spicey as H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS.  The guys there get a kick out of watching you squirm, but in a funny way. IT's a good thing I speak some basic spanish or I would have dieeeed."}
{"text":"Visits: Once, for lunch.  Food: So, everyone says that this place is amazingly authentic and incredibly spicy and flavorful. Now, I've never been to Mexico, so I can't comment on the authenticity. But in terms of spicy and flavorful? Not to me. In terms of flavor other than spicy heat, the whole business tasted pretty bland, from the shredded beef to the salsa to the thin and runny avocado paste. The corn tortillas were presumably relatively freshly made, but had the texture and flavor of stale cornbread crossed with dry cardboard. The only flavor that really reached my taste buds was a mild sweetness, and that's not my cup of tea. One point off.  Also, I've got to mention this simply because so many people hyped up this place's red hot habanero sauce to me before I went, including a lot of reviews here. I've never, ever thought of myself as having a high tolerance for spiciness (I usually eat pretty bland, IMO!), but I slathered over a full ladle on each taco. I could taste the heat, sure. But it was pretty mild - I didn't even feel like I needed to drink water. Now, I will say that the people I went with thought I had an insane poker face. They put half as much on theirs and ended up sweaty, red-faced, and teary-eyed, so maybe I'm the weird one. Still, if a place is known primarily for spiciness, I'm going to expect that I'll personally be blowing smoke out my nose and ears. One point off.  Atmosphere: It's a dinky little stand outside, the only one of its kind on the block. If half the block were stands, that wouldn't be a problem, but it's not like that, so it feels a little strange. Trash cans were piled high, and maybe it's because it's Oakland and college students are inane, but trash was piled high on the sidewalk near it, too! Gross. Also, there's no such thing as seating, so people were just standing around with their food, trying not to make eye contact. Not the most fun way to spend a lunch. Given that it's a street stand, any single thing could've been excused. However, all of them combined = point off.  Service: It's self-service. No complaints.  Price: It's really cheap, to the point where even though the food is mediocre, it was worth the price. I mean, it'd probably cost more to cook it from scratch, even if you did own all the spices and bought in bulk prices. So that's unusual.  Overall, the price is great but the food is low on flavor, regardless of authenticity."}
{"text":"Not only do the tacos cost $2, but they are amazing. Four different kinds of meat. Huge fixin's bar. Two fresh corn tortillas. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Authentic hole-in-the-wall tacos that almost remind me of the taquerias back home in Cali. I wish they were closer to downtown but otherwise can't complain. Don't miss out on the flan for dessert inside the store as well!"}
{"text":"Good value for on-the-go option. I just tried the beef one and I don't think it's their specialty. Other stuff would be better."}
{"text":"Very cute local taco stand! The workers were super friendly and made us feel welcomed. My only warning is: be careful which toppings you put in! There are several sauce choices and some are SUPER, and I repeat SUPER spicy. It'd be great if they were labeled for customers who aren't familiar with the sauces. Other than that, very good & affordable! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Affordable. Filling. Authentic. And delicious.  Las Palmas is honestly so perfect for college students because it only costs $2.50/taco and the food comes out fairly quickly (though made by-order).  You pay in store (cash, credit/debit) and hand the numbered slip to the cook outside. You can choose among different types of meat. I personally like the chicken and beef.  The cook is honestly so nice and very friendly, though he doesn't speak/understand fluent English. If you ever want to practice your conversational Spanish, check this place out!  The food is so authentic and addictive. If it weren't far from home, I'd come every day.  I love how you can put in the veggies, quac, salsas yourself.  My only complaint is I'd wish they had labels for the different food items because some of the salsas are actually very very spicy. So be careful of what you get. Not everything is as it appears!"}
{"text":"Yeah! Authentic Mexican tacos in Pittsburgh. This is a small taco cart outside a Hispanic supermarket. You pay inside at the register and hand the grill master your \"ticket\" then you order your meats. There is also a condiment bar outside, but it is uncovered and exposed to the elements, which I thought was a little odd. Not the most sanitary of places but that is part of the experience. The al pastor and carnitas were fantastic. Their hot sauce ranges from mild to pretty spicy. There is also free guac. Would recommend Las Palmas to anyone looking for that authentic Mexican taco experience. There are no tables or seats so be prepared to eat in or on your car. 2.50 each taco, good deal!"}
{"text":"Amazingly tasty tacos! Everything from the corn tortillas to the toppings (so delicious) is incredible! I wish there was something like this in Rochester, NY. Thankfully, my daughter now goes to college here so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would ever pass up a taco from Las Palmas for Chipotle. This taco stand is quite the gem. I think everyone else has covered the tacos so I will talk about the grocery store itself. Inside, they offer pastries, snacks, drinks (I thought it was interesting that they included aloe vera from Asia), a small aisle for produce, spices, the biggest cans of beans you will ever see, all sorts of hot sauces, coffee, cheese, and meats. They even have body soap.   A few noteworthy things:  - their green mangos (don't be put off by the color - they are delicious) - the slices flan and tres leches cake sitting in the fridge - the ROASTED coconut juice (it's that much better than regular coconut juice, which I hate) - they sell plantains!   My biggest regret was neglecting the bucket of $1.50 tamales sitting unassumingly across from the checkout station. I was full from my two tacos so I didn't buy one, figuring they always sold them. I have been back twice and they have not been there. I am guessing that they make them on the weekends only and that they go fast. Learn from my mistakes."}
{"text":"This is a lunchtime staple for the people I work with (over at Carnegie Mellon University).  Every year when the weather starts getting nice we head over a few times a month (typically on Fridays for long lunches).  When you first arrive you'll go inside.  I recommend getting a drink (Jumex is my preferred variety), but depending on your salsa choice is not necessary.  You then check out with the cashier in the front and tell them how many tacos you want.  Two is enough for most people, and three is a good sized portion if you're really hungry.  At $2.50/taco, two tacos and a drink comes to $6 even.  You'll then head back outside and wait by the grill for your turn in line.  Depending on when you show up and what's currently cooking you might be there upwards of ten minutes waiting.  It gets rough, but it's worth it.  My favorite tacos are the steak and the chicken ones, but you can't go wrong.  After that you pile on the salsas and other toppings.  I will warn you many of the salsas are hotter than they look.  I stick with the guacamole cream and it's perfect.  The one thing to be aware of is that they lack vegetarian options on a consistent basis.  I've been there once when they had veggie options (a potato taco), but I haven't seen it or other choices since.  If you're veggie, this may not be your place.  Seating is non-existent.  That's okay.  Take your to go container and make the trek over to the picnic tables over at Schenley Plaza."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos that I've had anywhere, regardless of price. Buy some chorizo tacos, load it with tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo, grab some jarritos from inside, and enjoy on your favorite Pittsburgh stoop."}
{"text":"As I get back into the review swing of things, the first place that comes to mind in the Burgh is this joint. Having eaten here numerous times now, I can give it my legit stamp of approval, and this review hah.  I am enamored, by the whole experience of eating here. See, I lived in Mexico many moons ago and eating street tacos was an ADL - activity of daily living (common medical abbreviation). So yea I get a dose of nostalgia here, but their food is the reason I keep coming back and what I think about after I leave. As in previous reviews, the options are standard- chicken, bistec, barbacoa, pork. What they do that's special, that I haven't had elsewhere, is that they season their meat quite substantially using more than just salt and pepper. Their chicken meat is made with caramelized onions. Their barbacoa is ready to eat with a plate of rice if you choose- it's that flavorful on its own. You see the pics of their condiments, which are all you can add. There's the salsas of various kinds, including avocado and habañero (which is not dumbed down at all!). There's the fresh chopped veg toppings and grilled chiles if you're lucky. The final product of your ultimate choice is incredibly delicious, not to mention filling. I've had 2 tacos and been full, 3 and really full.  You pay for however many tacos you want inside the grocery store, $2.50 each, the cashier will give you a ticket of your quantity. You take it outside and hand it to the kind sir who will prepare your bounty. You can eat right there on plastic disposable plates covered in wax paper- they use plastic bags in MX. Or take it home, which I've done as well, and enjoy a less warm but still delish meal. The tacos are large, 2 of them fill a plate. It's an incredible meal at the cheapest of prices. The grocery store has authentic goods from their homeland, mainly food items but they also carry fresh meat and piñatas, just in case.  So back to being en enamorado- to eat these incredible tacos on the street, with paisanos, listening to tejano or mariachi tunes, for me can't be beat."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of Mexican places, so I figured I'd give Palmas a try. Great decision. I walked right by it at first because I didn't realize that it's not a restaurant but actually a Mexican grocery store. I paid only $7.50, got 3 filling tacos, and the cook was pleasant. He heats up the tortillas, tops them with protein, and leaves you to add whatever else you want on em. Definitely give this place a try. It's down and dirty, but then again so is everything in So. O."}
{"text":"I went there a year or two ago.  I called ahead of time to ask if they had something. The lady didn't speak much English but said yes.  I get there and the item is nowhere to be found. No one spoke any English and they had to call a cousin to translate, who came by 20 minutes later. He had no idea what was going on and confirmed they didn't have the item, wasting my time.  This place is constantly cited by the health department and i have no idea why anyone would wanna risk it, but I don't understand most of Pittsburgh anymore."}
{"text":"Honestly these are some of the best tacos I've ever had. They are just so simple and classic. I always go for the chicken tacos, with a bunch of squeezed lime, diced onions, cilantro, and tomatillo sauce."}
{"text":"Literally spent $11.50 for 4 tacos and a Mexicoke and was happier with them than my Tako tacos.  I had 2 chicken, 1 pork and 1 chorizo. The chicken is really bomb and flavorful. They have a guac/salsa/veggie bar for free toppings. Literally the best tacos I've had since being in San Francisco. Will return quickly."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've ever had. DIY toppings with awesome hot sauces. The meat is tender and cooked with onions. Only 2.50ea too."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST. Listen, I know they've had a tumultuous relationship with food code inspections but I promise neither I nor anyone I've ever brought here has gotten sick from foods. Even though the sauce cart sits outside, I've seen them change out the sauces regularly. The cooks are always super friendly be the TACOS ARE DELICIOUS. They have a good variety of homemade salsas, hot sauces, and other condiments to add on for free. Sometimes, if your lucky, they will have al pastor or beef tongue which are DA BOMB. This is literally some of the cheapest and tastiest food you can get in all of Pittsburgh and if you've never been here you are missing out."}
{"text":"The tacos lived up to the hype! Well worth the money spent and then some! The meat, no matter what you get, is just the perfect amount of juicy.  Even with that, I must say it was a little dissapointing that there was no place to sit nearby.  By the time I got home, my tortillas were a bit soggy."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh! The lengua was the best I've ever had. Carnitas is also crazy good. Excellent salsas and hot sauces, friendly service and great prices. We always stop here on our way through town. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Las Palmas used to be THE place for tacos. I'd go every week, sometimes twice. Over the last 5 years, they've been a consistently good place to eat, but the quality and taste have varied a lot. Most tacos here are good, but if you get unlucky, sometimes the meat will be not as fresh and won't taste as good.   Tacos cost $2.50. Go inside and pay first then go outside and hand your ticket to the cook.  If you want freshly cooked meat, ask for the rib-eye and they'll cook it for you if they have it in stock or if it's not too busy.   Almost all the salsas are much spicier than they appear so beware. Also, their light green sauce is like an avocado sauce and it's very good."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos they do something to the corn tortillas that is magical!!  I recommend the steak and chicken, and that you load it up with salsas! Avoid the super orange ones unless you have a serious heat tolerance."}
{"text":"CHEAP AND DELICIOUS TACOS.  I'm pretty sure one week I came here 3 days in a row.    If you're reading this and haven't been here before, there is a certain way you order: 1.  Smell the aroma of delicious tacos as you walk down the street-- I mean walk inside to the register and tell them how many tacos you would like (2 is a good number for me).  They take credit, debit, and cash.  Note: They do not do cash back here.  The cashier will give you a receipt that has the number of tacos you paid for. edit: I forgot to say that the tacos are $2.50 each! 2.  Go outside, give the man your little sheet of paper or he will ask how many tacos. 3.  Decide on what meat you would like, if you're unsure what they have, just ask what they have that day because sometimes they'll run out. The standard meats you can get are: chicken, steak, carnitas, barbecue, and chorizo.  He'll give you a generous amount on those 2 nice and crispy corn tortillas.. 4.  Walk on over to their toppings bar to the left and customize your taco to your heart's content.  There is guac, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and various salsas.  Beware! There are some super spicy ones that'll send you packing to the nearest water fountain. Also notice that there are sauce cups and utensils up top. 5.  Walk around in anticipation to good dining spot to enjoy your delicious tacos. 6.  Repeat!  For my tacos, I like to get the steak and onion and ribeye.  I top it with the green sauce and tons of veggies like the cilantro and jalapeno, tomato, and onion salsa.  I would also get a spoon, because a lot of your toppings tend to fall out while I'm eating.  Do your tastebuds a favor and try Las Palmas' tacos.  I want tacos now..."}
{"text":"Your token hole in the wall street food Mexican taco stand.  This place has cheap ($2 per taco!), authentic, soft corn tortillas with your choice of different meats which vary from steak, ground beef, chorizo, chicken, veggie, lengua.  Once you have your taco, there's an array of different sauces, cilantro, onion, and salsa that you can add to your taco.  The orange sauce was wayyyy beyond my spice tolerance, but I love drenching my tacos in the other sauces."}
{"text":"I love tacos. I love cheap food. I love small family businesses. Las Palmas consists of all three of these loves...therefore I love Las Palmas.   It's $2.50 for one taco, so $5 for two tacos filled with your choice of meat and unlimited toppings. And trust me, they are super generous with the meat and you can go crazy with the toppings, so just two tacos can make a pretty satisfying lunch.   My favorite is the steak and onions taco. The meat is fully seasoned and the double tortilla is nice and warm. Be careful with the different salsa though because some can be extremely spicy. Double check the spice level before you slather on the salsa.    Overall, I highly recommend Las Palmas as a Mexican option for a mid afternoon snack or a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The tacos here are cheap, fast, and delicious. Definitely way better than Qdoba or Chipotle. $5 for two tacos with your choice of many meats served in 2 corn tortillas. I chose chicken and my boyfriend got beef one one and chorizo on the other. They have a toppings bar with guacamole and tons of salsas. It was awesome to get to try different combinations.  We did sit on a small cement block in front of someone's house, which was a little weird. It's a shame that Las Palmas doesn't have a couple lawn chair sitting around or a bench in front of the store but the toppings bar takes up so much room that I don't think it would fit. And having more toppings is worth it.   We just went last Saturday and are already talking about going back tomorrow. That's how good it was."}
{"text":"Good tasting tacos, this are the real mexican taco deal.  They are very substancial so probably one or two will be enough.  There are a bunch of salsas you cam try be sure to at least ad some line and cilantro to give it a special mexican touch."}
{"text":"Do you hear that? That's the sound of every broke college student squealing in ecstasy over TACOS FOR $2.50. Come hungry, because these are filling. You can order as many tacos as you want (though three makes for a heavy meal), with as many toppings at you want. Let me repeat, FOR $2.50. I want to emphasize that the appeal does not lie only in the price. I'm unashamed to say Las Palmas has made up a considerable part of my diet for the past year, and I've consistently been impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients.   I suggest mixing it up - try a different meat for each taco base (there's usually a selection of 5-6), and challenge your taste buds with their range of salsas and fresh toppings. Brace yourself, they mean business with the spicy salsas.   Warning - It's a stand, not a restaurant, and offers no seating, so you'll have to take your tacos on the go. But despite being covered by only a small awning, Las Palmas is opened year round. (Yes, even when Pittsburgh becomes an arctic wasteland.)   Overall: believe the hype. This place is the stuff of dreams."}
{"text":"$2.50 Street tacos with a topping bar. No dairy but I don't miss it. Grab a Jarittos in the market and walk over to Schenley plaza for a great Pgh lunch."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS AROUND!  Every time I've been here there's an amazing selection of meats, toppings, and salsas. Everything from salsa verde to extremely fresh pico. The chorizo is my absolute favorite, but I always try something new when I go and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, baby. Las Palmas serves up the best cheap tacos Pittsburgh has ever seen. I should know, I eat here 5/7 days a week. :( (frowny face for my health, not my soul.)   You should know a couple of things before heading here. 1) The money exchange takes place in the little grocery store behind the taco stand. Roll up to checkout, and let the cashier know you would like dos or maybe even tres tacos. 2) They take card or cash, so no need to go to the ATM. 3) Some of the meat chefs don't speak English, just know your numbers in Spanish and how to say chicken. Also your por favor and gracías.   My personal favorite meats are the chicken, steak and onion, and chorizo. However, I've had almost all of them, and they are literally all the best thing I ever ate. So, ball's in your court there. If they have ribeye, that is also insanely good. As far as the topping situation goes, the have a small bar stocked with tomatoes, pico, grilled peppers, and a delicious avocado cream sauce that you're going to drench those babies in. Alas, no cheese on the topping bar for you, gringo.  Also, every single one of the salsas is too hot for my palate, which can usually withstand a fair dose of Mexican heat. Proceed with caution, and utilize those little sauce cups up top. Happy taco-ing!"}
{"text":"There have not been super good tacos on Atwood Street since La Fiesta closed.  (Sorry, Mad Mex.)  Thankfully, Las Palmas is here to save the day and provide the East End with excellent and inexpensive tacos.  This taco stand is just as amazing as the one in Brookline.  I recently went by a 50-degree late Sunday afternoon and there was quite the line.  The only downside is that there aren't any nearby benches, but if you can manage to wait for a few minutes, it's a quick walk to Schenley Park.  The store has a great selection of Mexican condiments, beverages, pastries, and fresh produce.  It's smaller than the store in Brookline, but would be a great place for students to shop--it's on par with what Groceria Merante is for Italian food.   PRO TIP: You pay for your tacos inside the store and then they give you a receipt to take outside."}
{"text":"It always has an yellow sticker from the health dept and it was closed by them.I will never eat there."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Don't bother taking them to go, they'll  just be soggy by the time you get there. Just stand up, grab three tacos, go inside and get a coke or something,  watch hungover college students stagger around, and enjoy your transcendent tacos."}
{"text":"First time there, for lunch. One chicken, one steak taco  I'll be back, seriously very good Actually excellent,  a must try!"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food, you must eat here. For $2, you get doubled up corn tortillas filled with any meat you want (they usually have 5 or 6 choices). The you can go to the topping bar and pick from an assortment of salsas.   I really can't say enough about how amazing this place is. If you live in Oakland, you have no excuse not to walk over for some tacos! (or glass bottle sodas inside!)"}
{"text":"Grocery Store with no seating. Food is about as authentic as it gets. Reminds me of home town taco trucks. If you don't mind standing it's great."}
{"text":"Best culinary experience in Pittsburgh for me...not that I have been to many Mexican restaurants. I ordered chorizo and chicken tacos..both delicious, although I wish I would've gotten another chorizo taco. On my next visit to Pitt, I must try the other options. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After eating here I felt like I had hit the jackpot.  I had wanted so badly to try Las Palmas tacos but with the public bus service being what it is today Las Palmas in Brookline was out of my reach. The hour bus ride there and back I could not commit to. Then I found out there is  a location in Oakland and after class today I walked from Fifth Ave to Atwood to finally have my tacos!!!   Las Palmas tacos are filled with 3 times as much meat then what I've been served at Taco Bell, Qdobe and Chipotle.  I am sending a warning to those cooperate chains you've got some competition in Las Palmas. I knew going into this the tacos would be big so I played it safe and got two. One chorizo and one steak and onions. The Chorizo may have been a tad dry but all is forgiven for the price of $2.00 dollars."}
{"text":"Fairly similar to the other location in Brookline. Basically, what you have is a small Mexican grocery store with reasonably priced produce and other goods. Outside on the sidewalk, during select hours, they run a small taco cart with pork and beef options. Each taco consists of two corn tortillas with a generous helping of meat, and then you get to add your own toppings and salsas. No vegetarian options here, and nowhere to sit outside. Most people seem to just stand around on the sidewalk and eat.  The tacos are cheap and authentic. It's definitely a hole in the wall experience, but quite tasty."}
{"text":"To be clear, the food is 5 stars. Completely authentic, well seasoned, delicious tacos, served in two (count 'em, two!) corn tortillas. As a vegetarian (occasional pescetarian), I was skeptical of the vegetable/potato taco, but wow, was I wrong. No Tex-Med lettuce, cheddar cheese to screw up the perfect flavors.   Only down-side, having to eat on someone else's front porch was less than ideal. It was cool finally finding the other latinos in the city, since 50% of the customers were clearly immigrant laborers having their weekend lunch out. I hadn't been able to use my Spanish since moving to Pittsburgh - problem solved! Don't worry, though, the two guys out front definitely speak English, too, it was just more fun for Carla and I to finally be able to speak Spanish somewhere.   My only complaint - no fish tacos? I guess I'll have to go to Reyna's for that. But it's good to know I can grab a real (good) taco this close to work."}
{"text":"I finally tried Las Palmas this weekend, and it lived up to its excellent reputation! It was unseasonably cold, so there wasn't any sort of a line out front. My boyfriend and I walked right in and paid for three tacos each at the counter before being served outside.  As stated in other reviews, the tacos cost $2.50 each and are very generous. You get unlimited toppings (salsas, hot sauces, onions, cilantro, etc) from the topping bar. We sampled the lamb and the shredded BBQ beef. The beef was my favorite, since the flavor was richer and it was easier to eat. The lamb was a bit fattier and more chunky, but still very good. I was hungry but not overly so, and two tacos with a beer back at home were quite filling enough for me. I could see myself eating three after a long run or a hard workout. I can't wait to come back...most likely next weekend!"}
{"text":"Five or six choices, from beef to chicken to vegetables.And they are all juicy and delicious!  Add toppings like tomatoes and onions as MANY as you want! And there are also several sauces you can choose from, or just mix them into your unique favor. The quality/ price ratio is extremely high and definitely worth visiting! The only shortage might be that there are no seats that you can only take away or sit on the stairs."}
{"text":"Freaking EXCELLENT, authentic food for an unbeatable cost. Plus, it's served so quickly that I might even consider it fast food, except that it's way too fresh to even receive that label.  The people that work there are all really nice, and since it's a grocery store it's nice because I can pick out a drink from their large selection to compliment the meal.  Also, the selection of toppings/sauces really takes the tacos to an entirely new level.  Basically lived off of this place over the summer."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since living in Brookline years ago (there's an outdoor stand there too).  I think these are the best and most authentic tacos you can find around town. They are probably a bit larger than what most people expect with generous portions of meat. They use 2 corn tortillas with each taco which is nice because you don't rip through them.   The chorizo is top notch (but naturally greasy) and if you're feeling bold try the red hot sauce or If you're insane the more orange habanero salsa (good luck!)"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had thus far! The meat is fresh from the butcher next door, and, for $2.50 per taco, it's easy on your pocketbook. There's no place to sit, so it's fun loitering about the outdoor grill and people-watching on Atwood St while eating standing up. Also, it's attached to a lovely little Mexican grocery. Try out some of the candies in the back of the store: I'd recommend the chilli-covered mangos, prunes, or tamarinds. ^_^"}
{"text":"Cheap, authentic, delicious tacos. What more could you want? I love eating here when I have the opportunity and am in Oakland. I'm never disappointed. They are not completely cash only, but do have a minimum on credit cards. You pay inside the small grocery store (which also has many delicious items including unique candies and drinks). Beware though- the red sauce is VERY spicy. Even if you can handle a lot of spice, I would be mindful of that. A must try for all taco lovers!"}
{"text":"Really good beef tacos! The fajita mix tacos were pretty good, and the chicken tacos were ok. The hot sauces are VERY goddamn hot so watch yourself, gringo. This little block in Oakland reminds me of a neighborhood in Queens... kinda dirty, filled with little international shops, people aren't super nice, and parking is hard to find. The tortillas they use are really good and they do themselves a favor by heating them up on the grill. This place is packed at lunch time."}
{"text":"Solid, cheap, and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great option for street tacos in Oakland. Part of the small grocery store, the Las Palmas tacos are a great dinner! I had 2 carnitas and the fix-it-yourself bar allowed for the salsa and toppings of your choice. If you like spice go for the roja salsa - it has a great kick! For both tacos it was $5, which is a filling and inexpensive dinner.  The people there were very friendly as well -- definitely a place to try for something different in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Las Palmas is a religious taco experience. These are no gringo tacos. They are made fresh in front of you and you have plenty of salsa options (from mild to super-spicy), cilantro, and lime to heap on to craft the perfect little slice of taco heaven. I could probably eat these every day, particularly the ribeye taco. I probably shouldn't have written this review hungry as I can feel my mouth begin to water for them now."}
{"text":"Overview_ It's the cheapest taco place you can find in Pittsburgh, and their tacos are actually very delicious. What can you ask for more? =)   Directions_ Go to the store and say the number of the tacos you want. Cashier will give you a number slip, and just bring it outside to the cook. Choose the meat you want, and it will be served. You add the toppings.   Note_ Their spicy sauces are EXTREMELY spicy, so be aware. Especially the red sauce can give you stomachache for a while."}
{"text":"My go-to taco place in Pittsburgh. Honestly, I've tried a lot of Mexican food all over the country, but Las Palmas is probably one of the best. The tacos seem pretty authentic because they make them in a little cart outside of the convenience store and the workers are much more comfortable speaking in Spanish than English! That being said, it's really easy to communicate with them as they are extremely friendly and helpful.   If it's your first time going to Las Palmas, make sure you go into the convenience store, go straight to the cashier, and tell them how many tacos you want. They'll make you pay there and write on a small piece of paper the quantity of tacos that you've ordered. Then, you bring that out to the small cart where they'll make the fresh tacos for you. There's another cart on the side outside where you can add toppings such as pico de gallo, guacamole, cilantro, various salsas, etc. Just a heads up - a lot of the salsas are pretty freaking spicy!   Delicious double-wrapped corn tacos with good large variety of proteins. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to spot for lunch! Amazing chorizo, chicken, pork & steak tacos. Can't get much better from a price ($2.50 for a taco) or taste stand-point. The stand is outside a small Mexican convenience store so customers can get drinks etc. from inside. People have to pay inside the store first and then come outside and order the tacos. They have an great variety of condiments including fresh cilantro, guacamole and varied level of hot sauces! Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh yum. I thought I was going to leave hungry after getting \"only\" two chicken tacos - could not have been more wrong. The guys who run the stand heaped on the meat, and I heaped on veggies and salsa toppings. I was stuffed, and could not have been happier. This is easily the best authentic Mexican joint I've been to in Pittsburgh, bar none. Do yourself a favor and go - the price couldn't be better, and the food is SO good.  FYI - if you do not like a lot of heat, DO NOT use the hot sauce in their topping bar! The orange sauce is SUPER FIERY!"}
{"text":"For the first timers- walk past the taco stand outside and into the market, pay for the food, make your way back outside, hand over your receipt, pick your meat, then prepare yourself to devour into your taco(s)!  You get a massive taco for $2.50! I was like \"shoot, I refuse to ever pay less than $5 bucks at a taco spot\" so I got 3 tacos. I think I would have done just fine with just one.   The tortillas that they use here are bigger than the usual palm-sized ones you find in other taco spots. And boy do they make sure to fill the sucker up! I had a hard time choosing which meat I wanted. Unfortunately for me, I didn't get our meat cooked upon request so I chose based on which looked the freshest. I got the carne asada, al pastor, and the fajita mix. Carne asada tasted a bit bland for me. Thankfully I got a little too happy at the toppings bar (as I always do) so the sauce covered it up. The al pastor was delicious! When you have grease running down your fingers, you know that's a tasty al pastor! The fajita mix was better than I thought it would taste. The onion & peppers definitely brought out a special charm in that taco.   I'm a slow eater; so with the size of the taco and massive toppings/sauce on it, it gets soggy fast. Have a fork handy in case your tortilla rips like mine. Also there is no place to eat your taco there. You gotta either find yourself a spot on the curb or prepare to use your car trunk. Las Palmas is smart. They get free promotion/advertisement with people standing around eating their tacos throughout the street. I had 3 random people come up to me and ask what I was eating."}
{"text":"Disregard any bad review. This place has the greatest tacos ever...never EVER had a bad taco from here and I go here a lot. The little toppings bar they have is super super delicious too. If you don't like super spicy food watch which sauce you get..I personally love them all! They even have little lime wedges for squeezing and cilantro to sprinkle on top. Support this small business, the people who work there are always friendly and the guy cooking the tacos is out there making your tacos no matter the weather."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST tacos in Pittsburgh. Great fresh toppings, cheap and fast. If you love tacos and have never been here....go now !"}
{"text":"Great street tacos.   There's a somewhat rotating list of fillers, with at least chicken always there. Try the lamb if you get a chance. You order your tacos, go in and pay then come back for your order. Wait time varies, but it's never seemed unreasonable. Beware the fixings: some of them are very, very hot. Get to know them in cautious quantities before you start heaping stuff on: appearances are deceiving. The (fried) tortillas are kept in a steamer: this may work against you during slow periods. (They're fine, except that they get very soft; I'm personally ok with that).  I've stopped there for a quick one while biking by, and we've driven there to pick up dinner for a group of people. Always great, once you learn how the place works. (And do leave something in the tip jar.)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple: FINALLY a good, authentic taco in this city. The carniceria and grocery is great too if you are accustomed to Latin American foodstuffs. The people are nice, prices are good, and the location has character."}
{"text":"Guys, I finally got to Las Palmas.  After wandering down Atwood Street, past my regular stop of Sorrento's pizza, my friend and I came to Las Palmas.  We wandered through the Mexican grocery store to be wowed by the many kinds of hot sauce, and then we ordered two tacos at $2.50/taco.  I ordered a chorizo and a pork taco, but the chorizo was the major winner.  The pork was really fatty and greasy so I actually didn't enjoy that taco and would not recommend it.  However, the toppings bar is the best thing ever.  There were plenty of different salsas, tomatoes, cilantro, limes, pico, and guac.  I love toppings so this was the highlight of Las Palmas for me.  The people who worked here were very friendly, and they accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Look, I don't care what people say: this place is awesome. Am I biased for being Latino? Definitely. But this is good cheap food. Comparing this place to Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. is not fair. Because comparing the street food from any country versus an Americanized joint is unfair because it is not the same -nor it tries to be-. Not saying the competition is not good, just saying the style is different. The food is cheap (about two dollars per taco) made in front of you in the street. No sitting, just street food -may be that is why it is so cheap?-  My favorites are tongue and rajas (potatoes, cream, and chiles which is a vegetarian option).   They also make tamales, which are not necessarily the best tamales in the world but they are the standard tamales you find in any Latino grocery store.  The meat section at the back certainly caters the Latino community -or those interested- as the cuts you find are the ones we constantly use, especially in Mexican cuisine.  Other than that it is a small grocery store that has products from Latin america.   COMMENT: they have fresh baked goods (pan dulce)."}
{"text":"WRITTEN BASED OFF EXPERIENCES BEFORE LAS PALMAS' SANITATION ISSUES: THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND IT HAS REOPENED.  EDIT 2/27/16: A friend of mine ate here yesterday (this is after they reopened). He's currently experiencing symptoms of food poisoning.   While my opinion may be unpopular, I am confident in claiming that I don't think Las Palmas offers that great of a taco. My multiple experiences here haven't been all that spectacular: it just doesn't live up to the hype. To start, I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas. They place their tortilla on the griddle to warm before your consumption, but this dries the tortilla. Corn tortillas do not a good job of reabsorbing the oils and sauces from the contents of the taco, unlike flour tortillas, which typically do this quite well.  Furthermore, each time I've eaten there, the condiment/salsa cart has been out of salsas, certain veggies and guacamoles, and the meats have been too dry. I think this attests to the lack of care for quality and sanitation that closed the store for a period of time at the end of Summer '16. When entering the convenience store, i could see how poorly maintained the produce sections were. True, I have not been to the location since its reopening, so this observation may be dated. I'll have to stop in again to reassess this.  Bottom line, Las Palmas is, by popular belief, a great place to grab a taco. It's quick, cheap and favored by many. There are changes I think could be made to the presentation/quality of their tacos that would make this market/stand far more appealing. I need to go back and try their tacos to see if their quality has improved since they've opened. When I do, I'll be sure to reconsider my rating of this Oakland staple"}
{"text":"Street-side stand right outside a grocery store. You pay for a certain number of tacos at the register inside then tell the guy outside what kind of tacos you want. There's no menu or label of the meats so you'll just have to wait for the guy to tell you. The problem is that they don't know english that well so I know some customers didn't know \"lengua\" is beef tongue and \"bisteca\" is beef but that probably makes people try stuff they normally wouldn't get. We got 7 tacos for about $17.50. I'd recommend 3 tacos for a hungry person, that 4th taco was a little painful.  In terms of flavor, all the meats were good and tasted authentic. The carnita and beef (tongue and steak with onions) were all savory and slightly salty like they should be. The texture could be a little better but part of the problem is that the guy makes them in batches and they sit out in catering pans for who knows how long, so they dry out a little and aren't warm when they're served to you. The salsa bar to the left of the stand has great variety and some of them pack good heat. The green salsa was a little bland the day I went but the avocado and hot red sauce were good at adding moisture and heat.  Overall I like Las Palmas, it's cheap and tasty but definitely on the shady end of the spectrum."}
{"text":"Just the best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh. A must try for anybody nearby!!  You have different choices of meat and get to dress your taco with any toppings you like. $2.50 a taco, hell yea!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic mexican tacos that take me back to SoCal. Not the cheapest tacos, but it is my goto spot for mexican food. Free unlimited condiments transform your basic taco into a supreme deluxe taco."}
{"text":"Great tacos for a great price! It takes a bit of walking to get here, as it isn't located near many other shops and is located in a residential area. Reaching a market with a taco stand outside is the right place! After paying the cashier inside the market, then the tacos are made outside at a taco stand. There's an area for getting toppings including various options of salsa, onions, guacamole, and more. The tacos are served in boxes, so toppings can be added directly onto the tacos. Otherwise, there are also small containers for the toppings. The tacos are absolutely delicious and I'm sure I'll be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"As everyone below me has said, it's amazing in the way that it's all authentic Mexican that fills you up for a low price. That being said, I wish there was more toppings so I could truly make these amazing tacos my own, but even without them, it was amazing! Will come back"}
{"text":"Been eating here for 4 years now. $2.50 for each taco is an amazing deal considering how filling and delicious it is. My favorites are the chorizo, carnitas, and steak. This place is so good that I've been willing to continue eating here all the time despite them being shut down every year for a sketchy reason. They are open until 9 on weekdays (I asked recently) and I sometimes shop at the grocery store behind the taco stand. It's the corn tortilla that makes it so delicious so I always buy a package of tortillas to make my own tacos/quesadillas at home."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food in Oakland, look no further than Las Palmas.  Despite their inexpensiveness, the ingredients are fresh and plentiful.  For a mere $5, you get two tacos made of corn tortilla filled with the meat of your choice (or potatoes, if you're vegetarian), and access to a toppings bar brimming with pico de gallo, cilantro, and salsas of all spice levels that you can slather on your creation.  I came here a couple months ago on a Friday with a friend when it was raining cats and dogs.  In spite of the rain, it became clear within half a block of here that the guys who work here were grilling up goodness.  I ordered the chicken and the pork (carnitas?), and put pico, green salsa, and guac on mine.  The guys who work the grill kindly gave me a bag to help us carry our tacos and shield them from the rain.  The chicken was delicious--tender and moist--and the guac was thick and creamy, and the tortilla shell added a nice crisp crunch.  The pork was a little salty, but was still good.  I washed it down with a bottle of pineapple Jarritos, whose sweetness served as a foil for the savory goodness of the tacos.  They were so good, there were no words exchanged between my friend and I as we greedily gobbled them up.  You know you're onto something delicious when conversation takes a backseat to savoring.  If you're hungry for authentic Mexican goodness, it awaits you past Chipotle and Qdoba a couple of blocks down Atwood.  Go ahead, walk those extra couple of blocks--it'll help you burn off some calories, and your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Inexpensive, delicious, and authentic. doesn't Get much better!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, 'nuff said. $2 gets you a small taco with choice of meat and unlimited toppings. Buy 1 or 2 for a quick snack or even 3-4 for a full-on meal if you want. The guys hanging around are usually very talkative with each other but also very friendly. If you get thirsty, wash your tacos down with some Jarritos or Mexican coke!"}
{"text":"NEWS UPDATE: LAS PALMAS OAKLAND REOPENED AS OF 12/12/16.   I consider myself a renaissance man with numerous interests, but particularly I'm a devotee to a life enamored with tacos. It has been my quest to find the titular taco king in the burgh, and I think Las Palmas is the recipient of this prestigious honor.   Food: While Edgar's and Las Palmas can be heralded as Pittsburgh's most \"authentic\" Mexican taquerias, Las Palmas takes #1 on the taco rankings for a number of reasons (and why I visit this establishment 2-3 times a week). The corn tortilla is doubly layered, fried just before your taco is prepared. Meat choices range include chicken, steak, barbacoa, pork and chilis (my favorite), chorizo, and occasionally lengua. The meats are all well seasoned and succulent, so there is no wrong choice. Where Las Palmas wins over Edgar's is the salsa and toppings selection. The spread includes pico de gallo, tomatoes, onions, chopped cilantro, seared chilis, and an airy avocado sauce. The best part are the salsas, which administer concentrations of capsaicin second to none. Note: I did not include the grocery component of the establishment as part of my review. However I've always found decent produce and a wide variety of imported hot sauces at LP  Service: Don't expect speedy or inviting service. You must purchase tacos at the register inside ($2.50 per taco, no tax, also separate from any purchase you make from the market side). The cashier will hand you a note with the number of tacos you ordered on it, after which you may join the lucky souls in line who about to embark on a journey to taco nirvana. Hand the grillmaster your note and let him know what type of meat you want on your tacos. The cooks often love chatting with the customers, especially if you speak Spanish well  Overall: Las Palmas provides an authentic taco experience with no frills. This restaurant is perfect for a cheap and quick lunch, unusual and fresh idea for a food date, or even a late night snack. After their most recent run-in with the health inspectors, they even cleaned up the place if you're worried about sanitation. Look no further than Las Palmas for the best taco in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"So yummy! My favorite is the beef with onion. It is always fast and delicious. It is the best taco I have had ever!"}
{"text":"AWESOME TACOS. Seriously. Best tacos in Oakland, for sure. And I love Chipotle. The tortillas fell apart, but they were still AWESOME."}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos! I'd recommend the steak and onion. Plus the spicy salsa is the best around."}
{"text":"Best tacos EVER (in Pittsburgh). $2 gives you a decent sized tacos made with two corn tortillas, your choice of meat (chorizo, pork, steak, beef tongue, etc.), and unlimited toppings. They have all different kinds of salsa ranging from super hot  habanero to not so hot tomato salsa. They also have guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and more. Did I mention they are unlimited?  The stand is right outside the Mexican convenience store. So if the habanero sauce is too hot for you, you can go in to get some Mexican coke. They also have these guava and other flavored drinks that are quite nice."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I feel incredibly stupid for not coming here more often.   Reasons why I am stupid: - This place is literally just a walk down the hill from me, and it should be super close to most Pitt students. - The tacos are delicious and freshly made. - The toppings are unlimited (literally, you can pile it on until you're forced to use a spoon/fork). Like, as someone conditioned to paying extra for guac at Chipotle, I'm pretty happy with unlimited amounts of slightly more goopy guac here.  - Each taco is only $2.50. But let's be real, the base price is more like $5 for two tacos because who comes here and just gets one taco?   Pay inside first, hand the receipt to the guy doing the grilling, and then enjoy your tacos, you lucky person you."}
{"text":"I am a southern California native and take tacos very seriously. I take anyone who craves good tacos here and everyone loves it. These are my favorite authentic tacos in Pittsburgh. $2.5 per HUGE taco. Two are plenty, but I get three when I am really hungry. Cash or credit.   This Mexican market makes fresh tacos right outside the store. You can take them to go, or eat standing up outside the market. I prefer to eat them right away because the tortillas can get soggy if left in the to-go box. You could also walk a short distance to Schenley Plaza.   There are rotating choices of meats so ask for their selection when you go. It often includes steak, chicken, chorizo, ground beef, and al pastor and/or carnitas. There is a phenomenal salsa bar to the left so that you can dress your tacos in salsa, onions and cilantro. They also have pickled onions and peppers. The avocado salsa (a thin guacamole) is to die for.   I will keep coming back here for as long as I remain in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, traditional Mexican food if you're willing to risk contracting salmonella.  3/5 clams."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos are not that easy to find in Pittsburgh. The tacos at Las Palmas are that. They also pack more meat in their tacos than usual. I've found the place to satisfy my taco cravings."}
{"text":"This is a grocery store with street tacos outside. They fill up the tortillas with enough meat to make you wanna eat with a fork. Their salsas are always fresh; beware of the spicy ones, as they tend to be too spicy for some people."}
{"text":"I don't have much more to add to the plethora of glowing reviews, however I do want to emphasize that this is a stand-- no seats. You go in to the store, pay the cashier, and then someone comes out and grills your tortillas and adds your choice of meat.  The pork was good, but I thought the chicken was more flavorful. Both delicious though."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican-American visitor from San Diego in sunny Cali (where there's a Mexican place every other half mile) and a constant visitor to Tijuana, there seem to be few places here in Pittsburgh that don't try to be \"Americanized\" Mexican places. But with this place, I can definitely say Pittsburgh can be proud to have a place that provides to them the deliciousness that is authentic street tacos. Street tacos normally come in small tortillas (common for Tijuana street cart tacos, with a few here and there that try to be different). For 2.50 here though, you get a more filling and larger taco with different choices of carne o pollo, cilantro, cebolla, sal, limon y rica salsa en dos tortillas de maiz!  Sorry, the enthusiasm got the better of me. Seriously though, this place really provides a great choice for authentic Mexican tacos for those southwestern transplants and Latin people who miss a little bit of home. And the locals here in Pittsburgh can enjoy what we've had for a good part of our lives. It may not be the perfect taco, but it might be as good as you can get here (and it's very good!)."}
{"text":"i use to live in little tijuana in east san jose, calif. generally the mexican food in pennsylvania is un-authentic and medicore. this place comes pretty close to original mexican food. been to mexico many times, had the real deal. i give this place a b+ . they sell hard to find antioxidant nopales/prickly cactus pink fruit called tuna in spanish. in season sept-nov.  back in calif. i use to pick it fresh. taste sorta like pomengranate/apricot."}
{"text":"This taco stand is terrible!!   (OK, not really, but since it's right down the street from me I dont want my secret to get out!)  This is as authentic as you'll find in Pittsburgh, along with Renya's in the Strip. The tacos are absolutely delicious. chorizo, lengua, chicken, ground beef, steak, and a new fajita mix are all offered, and the topping bar is fantastic. Be warned that there is no cheese or sour cream on the topping bar, but with the guacamole, salsa, and cilantro it isnt needed. Lines can be a little long during lunchtime, of course, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Step 1: Go inside the little grocery store and pay the cashier for however many $2.50 tacos you want.  Step 2: Take receipt the cashier gives you outside to the nice man grilling meat. Inquire about what meats they have that day (if you're lucky, maybe even a veggie option).   Step 3: Watch nice man stuff two fried corn tortillas full of your choice of meat. Drool in anticipation of the deliciousness headed your way.  Step 4: Take your already-overstuffed tacos over to the toppings bar and proceed to stuff even further with your choice of toppings (salsas, pico, onions, guac, cilantro, lime, etc.). Top until your heart's content, little taco-maker.  Step 5: Eat your creation standing up on the sidewalk, blissfully unaware of the juices running down your chin and the pico falling from your taco to the ground.  Step 6: Burn your eyebrows off due to dousing your tacos with salsa without realizing how intensely spicy their salsas are. Proceed not to care, because eyebrows grow back...and the tacos are freaking delicious.  Step 7: Repeat frequently upon realizing that this is one of the cheapest and tastiness meal options around!"}
{"text":"Gosh this place is good. Pay $2 per taco inside and get your tacos at the stand in front  of the grocery store. I'm full for $4.   All the meats are good and there is so much variety. Chorizo, barbacoa, ribeye, beef tongue, chicken, vegi, ... etc. The salsa bar is also very fresh and delicious. There are 4 or 5 different types of hot salsas,  fresh salsa, salsa verde, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, and guacamole.   Since this is actually a grocery store there is no where to sit. But they encourage you to stand around a eat, and quite a lot of people do. If you want the tacos to go, you can package up all of the salsas too.  In the back of the store at the butcher, they even sell fresh chicharones. (They also have a variety of packaged ones). The one I got at the butcher was a piece bigger than my face!  Not sure why the info says this place does not take credit cards, but I've used a credit card to pay for a total less than $2 before.."}
{"text":"This place is so cheap!! Honestly blows my mind why more students don't eat here. Cheap and delicious.  Yeah, it's a little sketchy the first time you order here, but once you get to pile on all the homemade salsas on top of your tacos, you'll forget all about it. Two make a hearty meal for me, and I can't see anyone not being full off of three. The tacos are probably more authentic than anything else you'll get in Oakland, are cheap, and fill you up. What more can you want?"}
{"text":"Although a market, their taco cart is a hidden gem in Oakland. My husband and I crave los Angeles tacos all the time and this is where we get our fix. Their tacos are amazing: ribeye and lengua are our favorites. Have some manzanita (Mexican Apple soda) with it and you're game."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to go downtown on lunch and get your Mexican grub on. Recommend the fish tacos."}
{"text":"I've been going to both locations for street tacos for quite some time. They have perfected the explosion of flavor. They provide an unlimited salsa bar or you can put any toppings on your taco that you'd like. Grab yourself an ice cold glass bottle of Coca-Cola and three or four tacos and that's a $10 meal that you can be proud to say you enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty bangin tacos.  This is the place to go if you are a Pitt student in search of some quality street food.  Definitely find this place somewhat interesting as it is on a stand but the chicken is delicious"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh. I've had almost all the meats but the chorizo was especially memorable! Would say authenticity is comparable to the tacos I've had in Southern CA. Would come here everyday if I could. :)"}
{"text":"These tacos are authentic as they come. My favorite is the carne esada. Beware it is just a stand outside of the store and there aren't places to sit or anything. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This grocery store with adjunct taco stand is a hidden gym in the Oakland/college town environment. Tacos are incredible for the price range, and they have a great range of sauces.  Pros: -cheap tacos $2.50/ tasty taco = muy bueno -they grill the taco shells so they come out flavorful with a crispy/chewy texture -Incredibly friendly staff -grocery store renovated in 2017ish so everything looks much cleaner -great selection from steak, ground beef, chicken, potatoes, fajitas, grilled vegetables, pork.  Con: -Parking: generally not very good, i usually end up walking 1-2 blocks -bc their \"toppings bar\" is left exposed to the open air, sometimes I have concerns about sanitation during hot summer weather"}
{"text":"OVERALL: one of my favorite places to go for cheap, tasty, authentic tacos. Toppings are nothing too special, but hey, it's only $2.5 per taco. One of my friends loved it so much that he took 8 tacos from Las Palmas back to his family - in Virginia! I heard this place got closed down a couple times due to health concerns...so maybe eat at your own risk?  Las Palmas is, and continues to be, one of my staples for good Mexican food. As a taco fanatic, I'm blessed to have discovered this place. I love it so much that I've walked here from CMU campus in the freezing 20 degree weather just to get my tacos.  After you buy your tacos from the cashier inside the grocery store, you go outside and show your receipt to the cook. He then heats up the double-layered corn tortilla right in front of you along with your chosen meats, and the aroma is delicious. Although the meat may not look like that much, it's definitely enough to fill you up. The best meat, in my humble opinion, is steak. However, chicken is also good - chorizo is kind of a hit or miss. I usually get 2 tacos every time I eat here, and load them up with toppings at the toppings \"bar\" right next to the taco stand. The toppings include a runny guac, pico de gallo, tomatoes, and a variety of sauces. One of them is extremely spicy, so be careful and ask the cook if you're not great with spice. Trust me - I got it once on accident, and even my spice-loving self had to chug water for a good bit to avoid an untimely death.   Anyway, I love this place. I'd do (almost) anything to get my biweekly fix of Las Palmas steak tacos!"}
{"text":"Great mexican!! Authentic!! 2 tacos for $5.   Beware: The red sauce will kill you from spice! I had to drink about a gallon of water after this; however, very good....I might have to try it again because so good"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!  I love this place.  I work in Oakland and have visited this place on several occasions for lunch.  Just wish they had a seating area, because in Winter if I walk down there my tacos would be cold by the time I get back to my office and parking down there can be difficult.  But it is just a cart on the street in front of a Mexican mini market so I can't complain.  The workers don't always speak much English but you can just point to what meat you want and all the meats are so delicious.  They have varieties of ground beef, ribeye, two kinds of pork, and chicken, and a fajita mix.  One of the best features is their salsa bar which has many delicious salsas and fresh lime and cilantro that you can try all of if you would like.  It's extremely cheap but I think it is cash only.  Definitely a great deal.  I haven't seen any veggie or fish options, so this seems to be a place for meat lovers, and the meat portions are generous."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic street tacos. I will highly recommend Charrizo and Carne Asada tacos. If you can handle some fire then you must try the red salsa it is no joke."}
{"text":"The tacos are scrumptious indeed.  I was also quite keen on their selection of sauces- everything from the pico de gallo to the salsa verde was smashing.  But don't pass up the grocery itself! Their produce selection is cheap as chips (particularly in comparison to IGA); I purchased a mango, 4 limes, a grapefruit, a sack of onions, 3 avocados, and a tomato for approximately 10 dollars. Next time I pop in, I fully intend to sample some of their pastries- I do have a soft spot for conchas."}
{"text":"Without question, these are the best tacos you can buy in Pittsburgh. There is no substitute. I wish we had a real taqueria in town, but we don't. If we did, this is what the food would taste like... I'll stand in the snow or the pouring rain to eat it. It's that good."}
{"text":"Some of the most addictive chips and salsa I've had. Friendly service. The tostadas were crisp and fresh. Great place for lunch. Assuming you don't go through three baskets of the free chips and salsa, you'll go home satisfied but not bogged down."}
{"text":"Delicious, good fast food at a great value! Fresh street tacos with a variety of meats (or potato), corn tortillas and DIY toppings bar with fresh salsas, guacamole, tomato, onions and cilantro all for one low price. A generous portion of meat and toppings made me full from two tacos. No seating is available but tacos can be put in a to go box and enjoyed in Schenley Plaza which is only an 8 minute walk away. Lots of Mexican beverages are available in the grocery store that the taco stand belongs to."}
{"text":"This hands down my favorite taco place..ever! Not just in Pittsburgh but I like it more than any other taco place I've been to - and that's saying something because I grew up in Texas. The tacos taste pretty authentic based on what I have eaten before and even though the chicken and other meats are very simply cooked - it somehow holds so much flavor. My theory is that the chicken tastes so flavorful because it's cooked on the same surface as the beef and other meats so it essentially gets infused with the flavors of the onions, beef, pork etc as well.   Maybe my attachment to it has to do with eating it so often in college (once a week at least) but I think objectively, it's really flavorful too! It's also pretty cheap - $2.50 a taco and two comfortably fills me up and people significantly bigger than me usually buy 3-4 max so it's a pretty affordable lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"A great grocery store with even better tacos cooking outside of it. $2.50 for chicken, chorizo, steak, and another I forget. Huge portions of meat served on two grilled corn tortillas with a salsa/veggie bar to add on whatever else. The chicken was awesome, the chorizo I liked less. Veggies were super fresh and I loved that you could pile on as much as you wanted.   Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"What more can be said about Las Palmas that isn't already listed here? Not much. Everyone is on point with their reviews of Las Palmas as offering cheap (2.50), authentic, Mexican tacos (gringo-style lovers beware). Three of these bad boys makes for a large meal for one person.   Pay inside the store and they will give you a receipt to hand to the people operating the taco stand outside. Pick your meat, which will then be placed on an incredibly fresh corn tortilla, load up your tacos with some condiments and salsa, and enjoy.  When you finish stuffing that last meat filled corn tortilla into your face, you'll realize that you will be back again and again to repeat your newfound feeding ritual.  Grab a Mexican soda from the fridge inside to wash down the meaty goodness."}
{"text":"This review is for the taco cart--muy delicioso!  As others have said, $2/taco is a steal--I ate 2 for lunch and was full until 7!  Yesterday they had chorizo, carne asada (beef), and lomo (tenderloin).  On Mondays and Thursdays they have beef tongue as well.  The toppings bar is totally what makes it--pico de gallo, salsa verde, a variety of hot salsas, guacamole sauce, and basically ever other topping you can imagine (except cotija--didn't see any cheeses but that was fine by me!).  The corn tacos themselves are great but the hefty portion of meat is a lot for them to hold--my second one tore after the chorizo juice soaked through.  Just be sure to bring a fork and grab some napkins!  There's not a designated sitting area but there's usually a crowd around there.  We took ours to go and then ate over by the Porch.  The cooks were very friendly and will put up with you trying to practice your Spanish if you're so inclined.  Voy a volver!"}
{"text":"As mexican as it gets around here! had an awesome experience eating off a sidewalk taco cart and squatting on someone's front steps in the middle of the night. options: pork, chicken, and beef. And a full condiment bar. real corn tortillas. Delicious. and at $2 a taco, as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Let's just say, I ate four tacos (each type with exception of chorizo) for lunch and then craved them again later in the afternoon. Going back tomorrow!!! Soooo good. Coming from LA, I can honestly attest this place hits the mark and settled my street taco craving. $2.50 each and they take credit cards :)"}
{"text":"If you want authentic tacos, you should look no further!   Ambiance: Doesn't really exists, because it's just a little stand outside a grocery store but the staff was super friendly. It was extremely hard do understand what the right process was to get tacos though. FYI, they want you to go inside and pay at the grocery check out and take your slip outside to get the tacos. Probably took us five minutes to figure the whole system out.   Food: Ridiculously delicious. On top of having great meats, they had a little bar set up with all your toppings. Probably 6 different salsas, an avocado that was to die for, and peppers and limes for toppings. That was probably my favorite part. Loved the variety and versatility.   Will totally go again, especially now that know the process. Best $2.50 tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"An awesome mexican grocery and taco stand. The tacos are $2 a piece, and there are about eight different fillings (including chicken, steak, and beef) as well as plenty of toppings such as pico de gallo and spicy salsas.  Note, there is no private seating available, but hey, these are street tacos!"}
{"text":"I live in phila and travel to Pittsburg every month. This place has the best tacos I have ever eaten. I travel a lot and eat out a lot. By far hands down the best tacos I have ever had."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious tacos. These tacos are legit. Salsa: legit. Slightly cooked tortillas: legit. Grilled jalapeños: legit. Cilantro: legit.   And they have chorizo!  If you enjoy tacos and taco-related activities, this is the place to be. Fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Flavorless meat and inattentive service. If this is authentic, bring on the Chipotle. Extremely disappointed given the hype."}
{"text":"I don't know the name of the tacos that I got, but they were really good and cheap. I want to try the others. I just pointed at two, which I think were pork and the other chicken. I really like the help-yourself toppings bar and their salsa. It was prime taco time so much of the choices were getting low/still being cooked, so I'd want to come back when there's a smaller line and less traffic."}
{"text":"Now these are tacos!! Nothing satisfies my cravings for AUTHENTIC tacos like the ones outside of this store. Plus Carlos is a total sweetheart and always stops to ask how your day is going. Did I mention these fabulous fabulous tacos are only $2!! And they come with a wide array of topping selections. And if you're thirsty you can get Sprite and coke made with real sugar (hecho en Mexico!!) these are much better and cheaper than the crunchy over priced nonsense from chipotle."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to try some tacos today, after passing the cart several times over the past year. There is always a line with others standing around eating tortillas topped with chicken, pork, steak, pico, fresh cilantro and lime, and at least 6 different salsas ranging in spiciness. And these tacos are down right delicious!  Very authentic and totally worth the wait. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$2 tacos cannot be beat!!!! they fill me up, and the condiments/toppings that they have on the side are awesome. plus the people who work there are so friendly! i love supporting this small local business."}
{"text":"Possibly the BEST tacos I've ever had!! They double stacked their corn tortillas so the tacos will be less likely to break! Best filling ever! Choice of Steak/ground beef/Chicken/Chicken Fajitas with mix veg/Carnitas/shredded Beef! Tried all except ground beef..they were all to die for! The best part was they had a whole condiment stations where they had fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, mild salsa, habanero, spicy and hot salsa!  It's hidden in the hood! Right outside of a Mexican convenient store! So a landmark in finding the place!  The make it fresh right in front of u! And at $2 each, u can't go wrong!! I don't I will ever find anything better!!"}
{"text":"So good! It's a little stand outside of the grocery store. Different meats each day. I got chicken and BBQ beef. The tortillas are warmed on the grill in front of you and after your taco is put together, there's another stand where you can add different salsas and toppings.   Tacos are $2.50 each and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The pork and pineapple taco with avocado sauce and Pico de Gallo is quite possibly the most amazing, orgasmic food to ever have graced the sad, littered streets of South Oakland. There is a certain charm to the sketchy looking exterior of Las Palmas, and the inside also doesn't disappoint. The unbelievable selection of Mexican sodas and the authentic vegetables and pastries brings new meaning to the phrase \"dive.\"   Go. Yep, I said it, walk on into that shady Mexican grocery store and say \"2 tacos please.\" Then walk your butt right out and live the the taco-induced fantasy that is Las Palmas."}
{"text":"This place is great! Coming from southern Orange County, CA I have been dying to find some decent street tacos! This place definitely fits the bill. For only $2 dollars a taco, it is well worth it. All the tacos are amazing, especially the potato taco. The ribeye taco is juicy and tender as well. With the large selection of salsas you can't go wrong. So so happy I finally found this place!"}
{"text":"Las Palmas #2 is in front of the Oakland Las Palmas mexican market.  Not sure how long Las Palmas has been making tacos in front of this market (was told on Friday thru Sunday only).  Similar to the Brookline location, tacos made on the street in front of the market.  So YUM!  The Pitt students are loving it.  $2 taco with corn tortillas.  Appears to be the same selection of meats and salsa's and toppings as the original.  Ordered two tacos, a carne asada and  a pollo.  The carne asada was just coming off the grill and was delicious.  The pollo was in a warmer and was a little tough and probably in the warmer to long.  The salsa's are great!  Las Palmas does have a facebook page."}
{"text":"These $2.5 tacos are honestly some of the best I've ever had. Lots of meat on freshly warmed corn tortillas. Pico de gallo and hot sauces to too them off. Watch out the light orange hot sauce is extremely spicy!!  I got the carne asada with onions and the carnitas. The carnitas did have a few bits of grissle, but it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"One of the few places with legitimate Mexican food in Pittsburgh!  And it comes from a taco truck!  If you're craving authentic Mexican food, this should hit the spot."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while now. For the price, these tacos are pretty darn good. I love corn tortillas and having two per taco helps make sure the taco doesn't fall apart. The toppings are truly the best part. The different salsas, cilantro, and lime added so much flavor! If you need to satisfy a taco craving, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I got 2 tacos for my lunch : fajitas and beef. They were pretty good. Take-away. Good price . I put 4 stars because I didn't know what kind of dressing are real hot or medium hot . I got the spicy one. They should put label on them."}
{"text":"oh em gee..... finally a taco worth Yelping about!  Thankfully I read some reviews before heading over as I probably would have waited in line first, not realizing you have to go in and pay first.   I think my total time in line was 12 minutes, I went around 12:30 on a Tuesday... but now that I think about it... classes are done for the majority of students in the area so I'm not sure how the line is normally.   My favorite part about Las Palmas is the condiment bar... I LOVE cilantro!!!!! And guac!!!! I also love not having to pay extra for these things. Although it wouldn't have been terrible considering the tacos are only 2.50 each.   Only complaint is that I am short and was not able to really view the meats before selecting. But sadly I'm used to my height challenged-limitations. Perhaps a dry erase/chalk board with the days features?  Also, would like there to be more vegetarian options!   But all in all, seriously, this place is amazing, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Best $2.50 tacos I've had in a long time =D Recommended the chicken tacos. I will be back before i know it.  Extra tip....hard to find parking depending on the time of day."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  These are some of the best tacos I've ever had.  There's really not much else to say that hasn't been said in all the other reviews.  It's a small stand on the street in oakland, you go in and purchase your ridiculously cheap tacos, then go back out and order them.  They have a plethora of toppings you can add.  I should really eat here more often.  Now I want tacos...."}
{"text":"Living in Central Texas for the last few years, I've had my share of good tacos. Honestly, these Pittsburgh PA tacos are better than 99.9% of the ones in Texas. Nobody can tell me that the other \"hipster\" taco joints in Lawrenceville are better than these. Best and cheapest meal in Pittsburgh by far."}
{"text":"Texas has a chain of gas stations that sells Mexican food - kind of like a crappy version of Sheetz. It's called Stripes. You can get corn tortillas overflowing with a variety of dry, tasteless meats, all either grilled or stewed. And there is always a condiment bar, full of salsas, cilantro, tomatoes and onion. Imagine my surprise to stumble upon such shitty Mexican food on Atwood Street! Dry, chewy, tasteless meats have those Pittsburgh college students all a-flutter. Next time you kids Spring Break in South Padre make sure to gas up at Stripes. You might be the only one dining there (the Mexicans are at Chipotle eating inauthentic College Station burritos) but you're be sure to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Annoy so secret gem for the best tacos in Pittsburgh! You order inside the grocery store and then give your ticket to the taco stand outside. These are pretty filling tacos and I'd recommend the beef and chorizo. Next to the stand there's an array of toppings and salsas that you can load up on. This is a must stop taco place!"}
{"text":"These are by far the best tacos in Pittsburgh. I recommend bringing some to Schenley Plaza on a warm summer evening."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good authentic taco, look no further! This place was delicious. The steak tacos and shredded beef are great! They have a little topping bar set up with many choices of salsas and toppings. We had never been here before and it was a little confusing So for all you first timers, you go inside the store and pay, then you give the grill guy your ticket. The only sucky thing is there really is nowhere to sit. But when the food is this good, they can get away with it. Only 2.50 a taco. We each got 3 tacos and we were full, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding tacos. Right on the street, very casual street food. Nothing fancy, pay inside and pick up outside. Delicious choices and you can fill up for 7 bucks. Try the avocado sauce, and selection of freshly diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and top it off with some fresh homemade salsa pico. Definitely stands as the some of the best carnitas I've ever had, and I'm from Southern California! I know my Mexican."}
{"text":"Love Las Palmas! Probably one of the most authentic places to get tacos in Pittsburgh. The tacos are cheap and you can add as many delicious toppings as you want. I know they've had issues with health code violations in the past, but I have never had an issue after eating here. You pay inside and get a slip with the amount of tacos you want, and hand that to the cook outside. He tosses on fresh corn tortillas and grills them while you decide what meats you want. I usually go with a chicken and chorizo taco since they have those at all times, but their al pastor and carnitas are amazing if they happen to have them when you go. Be careful with the salsas and always get them in the little to-go containers if you haven't had them before, some are insanely hot. Make sure to grab a mexican soda to go with your yummy tacos as well."}
{"text":"Probably the best taco I've ever had. Super authentic, cheap, and tasty. I tried steak and chicken so far and I was so sad to finish them. They're just too delicious, I wish I got like ten of them.. Next time.. Next time"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh by far.   Best selection of fixins too, some of the salsas are painfully deliciously hot, just so perfect.  A note to you dumbass college students though: 1) if you're wearing a Supreme hat you can afford to tip, that terracotta jar hanging from the cart is for tips, not for you to ignore whilst 'gramming; 2) form a single line, and 3) get out of the way when you're done."}
{"text":"Want cheap? Want convenient? Want authentic? Want delicious? How about fresh? Guess what? You've found it! This team knows how to bring it. Do yourself a favor and eat at this taco joint."}
{"text":"I have eaten at taco buses throughout California, Texas, the Midwest and south. I couldn't believe how amazing las palmas was. The barbacoa was amazing and the salsa bar couldn't have been more fresh. I have eaten at täko and other high end fusion restaurants in Pittsburgh and nothing beats Las Palmas."}
{"text":"Good street tacos--I had the tongue and chorizo. Both had generous portions of meat, and toppings are left to the buyer. I am tempted to complain about the price--2.50 per taco I'd high for street tacos, but they really don't skimp on the filling. I'd come here many times more."}
{"text":"In the area for the natural history museum and had a desire for Mexican. Yelp sent us to this location, is a site that sells tacos on the front sidewalk.  One main tip is that you pay inside each taco is $2.50. Then you proceed outside to pick the meat. Went with the steak and onions, ground beef, carnitas and chicken. I don't love the double soft shell tacos, they seem to get soggy and wet by the time we walked to the car. We loved the toppings bar nice and easy!! fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great street tacos. They had 4-5 meats to choose from and a nice toppings bar. I had the fajita mix which had chicken, chorizo, and steak. No place to sit but the tacos were very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Overall, they were simple, authentic, and fresh; it is comparable to Southern California Mexican tacos. The corn tortillas were a bit dry (I may have gotten some old ones), and there were two per taco (which I think is excessive). As for the meats, the steak could be more rare (mine were well done), but was seasoned nicely. The chicken was tender, but could use a little more salt. The chorizo was quite spicy and overpowers all the other meats. I would recommend eating it last to fully taste the quality of the other tacos.  There is a nice large bar to the side, but unfortunately didn't have guacomole. For $2.50 per taco, I would say they are a bit pricy. Best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh so far."}
{"text":"Las Palmas isn't just tacos, it's a way of life.   That being said, this place is AMAZING. $2.50 per taco?! Endless toppings?! Mexican coke in glass bottles?! Get outta town! This place has it all! By far one of my favorite places to eat...ever. The chicken tacos and the BBQ beef are my go-tos along with their salsa, pico de gallo, and endless lemons! I can't say enough good things about this place. You just need to experience it to truly believe it!  Just as a sidenote, the salsa at the toppings bar aren't labeled...do yourself a favor (if you're not into spicy salsas) and avoid the deep red salsa. Unless you're SUPER into spicy (trust me, I'm a lover of spice, but I couldn't handle this salsa!), I would steer clear. I tried it once and it literally made my mouth hurt. Other than that, everything is solid and delicious!   I'm constantly craving them. It's gotten so bad that I think of the amount of money I have in terms of how many tacos I can purchase at Las Palmas. So give it a go! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"After passing by this place all of the freaking time and seeing so many delicious photos on Yelp, I finally decided to stop by and try this place. Honestly it's not the nicest or cleanest looking, but looks can be deceiving!! I got three tacos: steak, chicken, and chorizo. For only $2.50 a taco (pay inside the store), I had to get more than one and the amount of meat that they give you is huge and is served on two warmed up corn tortillas! The steak meat was waaaaaay too salty and I did not like it at all. The chicken was not dry and was well cooked and tasted fine. The chorizo was SO DELICIOUS (I would definitely recommend the chorizo).  There's a fixings bar to the left of the grill station with tons of sauces and some of them are kinda spicy so just don't put too much on if you aren't certain. And they even have little plastic tins if you want your sauce on the side. I got the veggie salsa (kinda spicy) and the thin guacamole (delicious - not spicy).  All in all, I would definitely love to come here again to try the other meats. The food was done super fast and the cashier and the guy grilling were really nice and courteous. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tbh not a big fan, but this is more about personal preference than about anything else. I love a good hole-in-the-wall establishment. What I don't love is soft corn tortillas. If Las Palmas had flour or crispy corn, I would be sold. Other than that, I love the character that Las Palmas has. This a place that people have pretty strong opinions on, and they don't let those opinions affect them. They have faced their fair share of adversity, and every time they bounce back."}
{"text":"This is an incredible taco stand, where you can fix it up however you like.  The homemade hot sauce/salsas can get quite hot, so watch out!  They are very flavorfull though.  I think you get bigger tacos, so more bang for your buck than the stand in the strip.  Flavor wise, they are awesome, but a bit different than the ones in the strip. The Oakland location can be a bit of a pain to get to if you are driving due to a lack of parking, but if you are in Oakland, absolutely check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a duplicate review to the Brookline one since the only difference with this one is easier parking.P ossibly thing the miss most from living on the west coast is the abundance of taco trucks. This storefront taco stand is among the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Is it better than Reyna's Tacos (Strip)? Does it matter? Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.  You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies. Simple right? Yes Simple!"}
{"text":"In town from California and decided to try this place out because of the great yelp reviews, boy did I make a huge mistake. First off as soon as I got here some of the sauces didn't have lids on them and had flies ALL over them, I thought this was pretty gross but decided to still get some tacos and just use a sauce that had a lid on it. I thought the sauces looked pretty gross but thought at least the guy is watching over the meat, then I see him get a phone call and touch his phone with the gloves he was wearing and then go back to touching the food. For some reason I decided to look the other way when it came to this, maybe because I was incredibly hungry and needed to eat something asap. To top it off I go inside and look at the pan dulce, thinking oh at least this is in the store and enclosed, then I see a fly... Followed by about 10 other flies landing on pretty much every piece of bread they had in there. This is absolutely disgusting on many levels, and I don't know if Pittsburgh just doesn't have many Mexican options but this is totally unacceptable and I don't know how this place has a good rating let alone decent reviews. I would give this place 0 stars if I could and am now hoping I don't get any type of food poisoning.."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Best tacos I've ever had in Pittsburgh BY FAR. Plus, they are cheap and really large for an authentic taco experience (meaning normally traditional tacos are tiny little things, but these are huge and yet still done in the traditional manner for all other intents and purposes). I haven't had tacos anywhere near this good since moving back from NYC, and now I'm obsessed. Yesterday after a long bike ride that landed us at REI in South Side Works, we decided we needed these tacos, and went the extra few miles (up hill) to get them. Mind you, he was out of all the usually choices (carnitas, barbecoa, stewed chicken, carne asada, etc...) and only had some sort of 'whatever was left over' mixture of chicken chunks, pork remnants, and select veggies - I was skeptical... but it still was amazing! I've always found the true sign of a good cook is being able to make the crappiest ingredients still into something delicious, and this dude does. Seriously, good stuff. It's worth braving the throngs of coeds ;)"}
{"text":"This is the best authentic taco in pittsburgh, (palmas not necessarily only this location) the toppings bar is incredible, and the price is great. You know it's legit when a taco has two tortillas.  Big containers of chopped cilantro, white onion, lime wedges, and gallons of salsa."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos I've ever had. The price is cheap, the ingredients are fresh, and the tortilla tastes amazing.   If you like beef, make sure you ask for a ribeye steak whenever it's available. My go-to meat choices are barbecue, pork, and the ribeye!"}
