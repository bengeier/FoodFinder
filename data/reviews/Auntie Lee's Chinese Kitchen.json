{"text":"Ordered twice here and everything was not authentic and tooooooo salty. Avoid the place even you have nothing to eat at midnight."}
{"text":"Update to update:  The food tastes good again after going back a few times. I guess it's hit or miss. Or maybe they were just having problems earlier this year. Anyway the food is good and the owners are nice."}
{"text":"I don't review and give out one star lightly. If I can give it 0 stars I would.  Whatever you do... DONT ORDER FROM HERE. I asked for extra sauce and the person swore at me in Chinese and told me to never order again. During that same order, they failed to bring me one of the dishes. So I called back to ask for a refund. When I asked for the refund, I can hear the chinese owner swearing at me in Chinese. i ask the store clerk why was he swearing and yelling, they just brushed it off as him having a bad day. As a Chinese person, I've never seen someone so rude in my entire life. You guys should be ashamed to call yourselves Chinese.   ru guo ni bu zhi dao zen me fu wu jiu bie chu lai hun le. zi ji bu xing hai ma wo, mei jian guo zhe yang de ren"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this restaurant.  Food: The food was better than expected. I expected to have chopstix grade food but it was surprisingly edible. The portions were of decent size, and it wasn't excessively greasy. I did feel that the food was on the salty side though. I'd recommend one of the combinations platters, they provide the best value for your money. I'd rate it 3/5 stars, its not gourmet chinese, but it's not garbage either.  Delivery: I have never had to deal with such an incompetent delivery driver. The delivery driver got to my apartment over an hour after grubhub's expected delivery time. The driver was so bad at his job that I had to give him turn by turn directions for getting to my apartment, and my apartment is located by the intersection of some well known campustown streets. The delivery service was absolutely terrible, I'd rate it as a 0/5."}
{"text":"Before I write this review I just want to say that I've only ever gotten delivery from this place and never actually eaten at the restaurant. But having said that, I've never had a bad meal from this place. I'm surprised by all the negative reviews but in my opinion I've never had a better General Tso's chicken in my life and I've tried looking. The portion sizes are not the best but I'd prefer a decent amount of something good than a lot of something shitty and most Chinese places try to give you a large portion and not well made food."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.   Amazing food, I got the General Tso's chicken with rice and a egg roll and an appetizer of Fried Dumplings (and yes they have the good dumpling sauce.)  1) amazing general Tso's 2) amazing rice  3) best dumplings in champaign.  4) SUPER speedy delivery 5) they're on grubhub!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery here last night and I never got my order. I didn't receive any calls about it nor will anyone pick up at the store."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Got the yang chow fried rice and it was bland, so I added salt. Little did I know that it would only bring out the cardboard flavor.  My friend ordered the general tso's chicken. It was too fried, too sweet, too salty, and too HORRIBLE.  DO NOT EAT HERE (unless you have no taste buds and love drinking grease)."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here last night. It took nearly 90 minutes and they forgot one of the items I ordered. They did deliver the vegetable dumplings, which were soggy and coming apart. They delivered the hot and sour soup that was so over salted as to be inedible, I had to dump it out after a couple bites. They did deliver the Szechuan chicken with white rice, but the rice was significantly over cooked and the chicken was at best mediocre. Needless to say, my first experience with Auntie Lee will be my last."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in CU! Love their dumplings, egg rolls, and mongolian beef. Auntie Lee is pretty hard to find because they share a building complex with an Indian grocery store. Seating is pretty scarce, and there are no restrooms for public use, although I am sure the kind staff would let you use it in emergencies. I also had to wait a while for my order to be ready, ordering by phone is the way to go. Because of this, I would recommend you to order to go in advance by phone and pick it up.   I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up my delicious order. The food was not too salty or sweet, just right for me. I enjoyed the food, and the portions were excellent, leaving me plenty for leftovers. The next day, the food was just as good after a 1 minute microwaving. Because of this, I know the food is natural and not the \"fake food\" served my McDonalds and some cheap Chinese restaurants. I would definitely give the excellent food a five star.   The service is excellent, with friendly staff that are prompt and accurate at taking your order. When I ordered online, the chef had followed my special request placed through GrubHub exactly, packing my food in microwave reheatable boxes and holding off on the sauce with my orange chicken. Just like the excellent food, Auntie Lee's also nailed it with its excellent service.   Another plus is that they are open until 1am, sometimes even later, making Auntie Lee's the perfect go-to for late night ordering. Although I am am not a late night person, I will definitely order Auntie Lee's if I ever find myself wanting a late night snack.   Overall, I would recommend Auntie Lee's to anyone, even someone that doesn't really care for Chinese food. With food this good, they might just change their mind!"}
{"text":"Delivery time was about 30 mins (ordered @ 12:15am) Pork fried rice-greasiest rice I've ever had.  Smallest portion for the price I have ever received. No frills...pork fried rice was rice, pork, and green onions.  They could have at least threw an egg in there.   Egg rolls were small but had a nice flavor also very greasy  Crab rangoons were very greasy. Very oddly shaped.  I'm just going to call it lazy rolled.  Flavored like pretty much any other crab Rangoon I've had in life. Just so damn greasy.  I guess it is good for late night.  I probably wouldn't order in normal dinner hours when I had more options."}
{"text":"Auntie Lee's is my favorite restaurant in Champaign.  The food is consistently delicious, the delivery is always prompt, and the employees are really nice. I am no longer a vegetarian, but I still order the general tso's tofu because it's the best tofu in town. Also idk why they have samosas, but they're REALLY good samosas. Quality Chinese food at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"So I ordered from Shanghai and arrived to find Shanghai was Auntie Lee's. Expensive and not quite tasty. I made it home and realized there was no gravy for my Egg foo young. I called to share this and they were unapologetic and unwilling to credit me for their error. After some fussing, they agreed to deliver the gravy. By that time, the food is cold af..never again..no thanks #shittyshanghai"}
{"text":"the general Tso's chicken was an abomination and worse than even panda express's orange chicken. each chunk was nothing more than a skittle sized piece of meat surrounded by breading and coated with an imperviously thick layer of sauce. the spring roll it came with had the consistency of an old paper towel roll. the crab rangoon was decent if youre into that kind of flavor but pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I've tried every fish dish on the menu at least once, some several times, always good. The Won Ton soup is delicious. Family owned eatery with nice owners."}
{"text":"Love this food. Although I tried to call and place an order for pick up 3 times. Once I arrived at the location to order in person I clarified if I had the right number and they said yes. Meaning they just weren't answering my phone calls which came 5 minutes before I showed up. Super frustrating that they wouldn't answer their phone, but in the end the food is great. I would ONLY recommend ordering online through grub hub or another system, because ordering over the phone has proved impossible, and ordering in person took over 20 minutes. Also, it was 10:30pm and two elementary aged children were working the counter... which is extremely concerning to me."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes, late at night, you just want some Chinese food? This place is open till 3 am, and they're pretty much the only spot in town open so late. They use that as a reason to serve bland, terrible food at sky high prices. $5 for a sixteen ounce cup of wonton soup with two wontons? $10 for fifteen pieces of fried tofu drowning in sauce and a carton of white rice? Fried noodles in a watery soy sauce instead of thick gravy? Two stars because some nights, you just need some damn crab rangoon. But during the day, go literally anywhere else for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I had an all-night study/work session and got hungry around 10:30ish. Auntie Lee's was one of the few places open that deliver at that hour on a Thursday that I haven't tried before.  They also let you conveniently order online. I didn't have to call or even use a third party service like grubhub which was nice. The beyondmenu website was pretty straightforward, but nearly all of the menu items didn't have a description of them. I typically like to try something new, but when I can't be certain it's something I might like, it's a little off-putting and I end up going with a \"safe\" option, in this case, it was a sesame chicken combo with a side order of pork dumplings.  Delivery was really fast, less than ~25 minutes. The place is right down the street from my place though so I would hope it doesn't take too long.  I unpacked all the containers and dug in. The sesame chicken was just alright. I thought the first couple bites were good, but the sauce the chicken was in got kind of boring and sweet & sour-y tasting, which I feel like happens to a lot of Chinese food. There was a decent portion of chicken, but there were hardly any vegetables, I'd say maybe 4 pieces of broccoli, tops, and nothing else. The fried rice that came with it was also a fairly good sized portion, definitely better tasting than any white rice, in my opinion. The eggroll didn't impress me, I feel like it was something out of the freezer. The dumplings seemed just alright, too. The outside was tasty but the inside pork didn't impress me.   Overall, it was just alright. After everything was said and done, this cost me $20 with delivery and tip. It was a good amount of food, but I personally didn't think it was anything special, or worth anywhere close to $20.   There's something about most carry out/delivery Chinese food that just doesn't impress me. I feel like the meat and fillings are almost always low quality, and the price doesn't even reflect that. My chicken entree and 1 egg roll was $8.55  I digress. It's fairly standard Chinese. Good late-night option, quick delivery, online ordering."}
{"text":"dislike it. This place closes late so basically is our last choice. Yet, the foods were terrible. I would rank it as The worst Chinese food near campus."}
{"text":"Yummy food!  I called the restaurant for a delivery and ordered a fiery chicken and an order of crab rangoons. The person was a young, friendly voice. The pricing wasn't too bad too. As soon as I ordered I only waited about 45 minutes and my food came. The fiery chicken had a great taste and crunchiness! The Rangoons were yummy with the creamy cheese and nicely fried! Best Chinese restaurant on Campus!  I will definitely order here again!"}
{"text":"For late night delivery, I'm a fan. You can order on their site or on third party apps as well, which makes it that much easier. I've had their egg rolls, veggie dumplings, crab rangoon, and lo mein. Everything has been pretty good. Again, for late night Asian food, this is usually my go to."}
