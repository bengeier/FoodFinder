{"text":"The bathroom was nasty toys all over the place they bring there baby to work husband boiling something in big pot i ordered orange chicken couldnt even eat it never ever again"}
{"text":"This will be my second time ordering from Top China. The food is very tasty, the portion sizes are decent. I would most definitely recommend this place to others. The only con is cash only."}
{"text":"It's a no for me dog.   I got Singapore chow mei fun. The vegetables were undercooked but the mushrooms were soggier than the noodles. The noodles were so crunchy I had to look down to make sure I wasn't eating the undercooked onions or cabbage. The shrimp were overseasoned and overcooked. The saving grace: the Food Lion beside them."}
{"text":"I used to work over that way at this school  and on break I would go to Top China the food don't taste like they used to taste at all only thing good is the Chicken Wings and Shrimp fried Rice."}
{"text":"Pros: Good price for the amount you get Food taste good Cons: Is cash only They use alot of MSG"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   During a long day on the road one of my drivers wanted lunch and asked where to go. Since we were around the corner, i mentioned this place.   %93 Sanitation Grade  It was pretty empty when we went and i almost told him to keep driving because even though i have never been here I've been in the area and noticed its usually busy. Ahh anyway. We both ordered fail proof safe option Shrimp Fried Rice with extra scallions.   In short, i probably won't order that again. It was cooked pretty promptly which was great. Once we got back in the truck I cracked mine opened and BLAM, POW, BANG, POP a mouth full of nice shrimp, rice and the lack of any flavor. My driver said the same thing. Going further saying they could have added some MSG or something. I thought that was pretty funny.   Anyway, would I go back? Sure. Now i just know to place my order and ask for them to add some type of seasoning to it or soy sauce. I won't let this experience deter me from trying them out ONE more time.   TTFN"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Favs: general chicken, shrimp fried rice. Only complaint is cash only."}
{"text":"This is your typical Americanized Chinese food. Low prices but good taste. I always frequent that place when I come to Charlotte. Simple and quick. One downfall is cash only!"}
