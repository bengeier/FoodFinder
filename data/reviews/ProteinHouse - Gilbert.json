{"text":"GF ProteinHouse Pancakes taste just like homemade only fluffier, great texture too, delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Protein! Especially if you're interested in tracking your macros! Delicious, yummy & healthy! The people that work there are really helpful too!"}
{"text":"It's great fresh made to order food but they really should work on getting more staff or a larger cooking area for busy times. It shouldn't take 30 mins to make 1 wrap and 1 bowl where both meats are cooked medium rare (5mins). Otherwise good food even if it's slightly pricey."}
{"text":"Always get their protein shakes and every time it's a win! Doesn't matter what flavor!!! Go!! Best shakes in town!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!  I've gone several times and have tried a few different things on the menu (although I keep going back to the pancakes because, well....PANCAKES!  The Chocolate Monster are my favorites)  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the place is always clean. Plus, the portions allow me TWO meals for the price of one.  I am also in the process of using them for meal preps as I'm able to customize meals for my macros and the cost is super affordable.  I would highly recommend Protein House. It's clean eating that's delicious too!"}
{"text":"First of many meals I'm sure at this much anticipated gem. Although I felt a tad silly ordering \"The muscle boy\" it was delicious! Steak was cooked perfectly and tender. Love the no frills, fuel food concept. I'm gonna need to make some changes to my budget to eat here more often. Friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sexy bowl. Super yummy great service with a smile :) nice clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Walked in because my boyfriend and I saw how busy Protein House was so we thought we'd check it out!

I am vegan, and my honey is not so it is difficult finding places in Gilbert we both enjoy. I was lucky to see they offer lots of plant based meals I will eat. 

I got the vegan protein pancakes, while my boyfriend got a turkey burger. PH didn't disappoint, my pancakes had four different fruits and sooo delicious!! 

The restaurant is clean and modern. Despite how busy they were, the owners ensured our meal was delivered in a timely matter and check with us upon leaving. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. There is also outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Tried PH for the first time today with the hubby. Great service as soon as we walked in. Greeted at the door and everyone was so friendly. I got the ceaser chicken salad and hubby got the ceaser chicken wrap. Both were very good. You can really taste the grill flavor of the chicken. Felt full and satisfied after the salad. Clean, bright and likes the music playing. Will definitely need to check it out on the weekend with the kids."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. I got the general bowl. It was so tasteless. The bison was way over cooked and I asked for medium rare. It tasted like a frozen hamburger patty that they burnt to a crisp. I had to put a gallon of salt it in just so I could at least brave it through. The water was good though."}
{"text":"I ordered the mayra vegan pancakes and they came out looking beautiful but tasted awful! They tasted like plain baking soda or some combination of raw ingredients despite being cooked through. I tried to eat them at first but even piling on banana and syrup couldn't mask the taste. I ended up taking them back to the counter and the staff was really sweet and without hesitation told me to order something else on the menu. I got the southwest burger and it was much better. The beyond burger patty is super heavy and not a huge fan of it but after the pancakes I was not complaining. The staff also said they would check the batter and said that they thought the pancakes tasted bad because they were vegan and there wasn't much to work with ingredient wise. But I've had phenomenal vegan pancakes in the valley, pomegranate cafe and 24 carrots pancakes are sooo good. Also had vegan protein pancakes at Nourish down a mile or two down the street from Proteinhouse and both my brother (nonvegan) and I love them. I'm thinking maybe the pancakes weren't good because proteinhouse doesn't use certain ingredients (wheat maybe) not sure but was looking forward to trying these pancakes for a couple months and was disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is really tasty but the smoothies are subpar for how much you're paying. I've tried almost all of them and there's not much flavor, kind of tastes watered down and I think they put too much protein powder bc I only taste vanilla in all of them. If they made them with more of the additional ingredients like almond butter spinach strawberries etc they would taste a lot better!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Well run, employees are attentive and the food and drinks are the best. Either pregaming with a protein shake or stopping in for food I have never been disappointed! Protein house delivers quality every time. I love smoothies, but most of the time I'd rather make them at home then have some \"juice bar\" sugar me down.....I don't feel like that at the protein house. Quality products and quality service every time! Can't say enough great things about this place.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Hmm. It's a healthy food place. I get it. Kind of bland. Kind of expensive. The service was sub par. My brother's salad was not brought out with the rest of the meals. In fact, we had to ask where it was. It took about 45 minutes for him to get his food. Almost all of the other meals were missing parts of the food. Not great. Also, full of gym rats."}
{"text":"Over the past few months the smoothies have not been consistent. There seems adequate staffing, but the wait was still long and the employees were confused. When I finally got the smoothie, it was almost the consistency of a slushy with too much ice. Hopefully this place sorts out their training soon."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Way over priced and food was below average. Cup of fruit was like 5 pieces. Seating was uncomfortable. Aluminum chairs."}
{"text":"Tons of high quality food with clearly listed macros! Everything is super tasty and the staff is great. Yes it is a little more expensive, but you are paying for high quality AND just about everything on the menu is large enough to share or split into two meals! The pancakes are huge--my kids can share and we typically have leftovers. This is the perfect place for anyone truly--its a huge bonus that you know the exact macros if you are tracking your nutrition. Oh and a wonderful local couple own it so you can feel good about supporting a small business owner!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my chicken salad was borderline edible. The avocado was as hard as a rock, the lettuce was wilted and tasted old (possibly because they add hot chicken on top of cold greens) . The entire salad was not at all appetizing and let's just say you'd be better off with Chic fil a salad with lots of fresh veggies and chicken seasoned properly then with 2 salads and juice that ended up being over $30.00.  Small portions and bland, we won't be coming back. Bummer."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying PH as I have seen it in Scottsdale but never actually stopped in. I ordered the PH burger and my husband ordered the chicken ceasar wrap. I was suprised at how much my husband liked the wrap. He is usually really picky (getting him to eat healthier options out is a hassle). We will definitley be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying ProteinHouse, as I've been wanting to try it for some time. I was fairly disappointed to say the least. I love the environment, the concept. I only have two discrepancies being the pricing for the portion of food and the wait. It took approximately 30min for a Ph Burger($13.00) and a small portion of sweet potatoes bites. It wasn't busy at all either. I feel this place will get better with time"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super friendly staff. The coffee/espressos are amazing and was made to my exact specifications. I walked in starving, told them how many macros I had allotted for my lunch, they helped me choose something that fit PERFECTLY and served it to me hot and fresh. I've been  there a few times now and my meals are always SOOOO GOOD!  I walk out full and happy. Especially because I know everything I ate was fresh and healthy. I even pick up our dinners to go on days when I'm super busy and don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"Everything is laid out for you on the menu. The food tastes great. You won't be upset."}
{"text":"Finally a place to get healthy food & it is just AMAZING!! They have it all from protein shakes to protein pancakes! Serve breakfast ALL DAY, I mean can't get any better!! 
Right next to EOS which is perfect, after a great workout is time for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this location. I had an opportunity to meet the owner and she is very nice. My score is based on the poor management here.  The manager (Josh I think) seems distracted and I can never figure out why they have so many people there just standing around.  When you finally connect with someone who gets what you need, that person is either let go or moving on.  Hopefully, real leadership will be positioned before they sink this place. You can only give your money to such immaturity for so long no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"I was unable to receive a refund for my bad order.  I would not make a special trip down to get a coupon for a free meal. Too bad the manager wouldn't refund my money like any other restaurant would have done. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! I visited over the holidays and was so impressed that I had them cater my seminar. It was a slam dunk and all the attendees loved the food. I live in San Diego and wish there was one here. If so, I'd have them make all of my meals, and I'd undoubtedly be leaner and healthier. Over the weekend I got the LR Steak Burrito, Barbecue Bison Wrap, PB Crush Shake (liked it so much I had 3), and peanut butter balls. I absolutely loved all of it. The facility is clean and fabulously designed and the staff is friendly and expedient. I highly recommend this place if you want a healthy meal that tastes great."}
{"text":"OK so I had to come check this place out and I'm going to tell you something it's high-quality restaurant food at an extremely cheap price I had the pH burger organic breast-fed Bison with three egg whites low-fat cheddar cheese lettuce tomatoes 649 cal 58 g of protein 54 g of carbs 23 g of fat with a side of sweet potato chunks I can't understand why people are making excuses the walk in the unhealthy fast food restaurants and we have places like this in the valley you have to give this a chance I highly recommend it the service was great the atmosphere was awesome check it out everything from breakfast all day to desert all lean the quality protein Looking forward to my next return trip to try out the pH protein pancake combo"}
{"text":"I love this place and am sad that I don't live closer! The food delicious and healthy (of course), not to mention the interior design is downright badass. I'd come here everyday if I could. 

I highly recommend their Greek Bowl and also their BBQ Bison Cheesesteak Wrap. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out multiple times to grab a protein shake after my workout. This place offers a lot of clean eating options but can get a little pricey as most clean eating places can. You can add ingredients and take things off to cater to your liking. Staff is friendly and place is clean. Overall, good place for a clean meal or shake if your not put off by the price."}
{"text":"Heatlhy, good, inexpensive, and options galore!  ProteinHouse has nailed it! 

Really happy to have tried this place out, and fortunate to have done so the week they opened.  I have a feeling that the line won't be short for long! 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"What a great place! We are avid fans from the Original ProteinHouse in Vegas and this place was just as wonderful. 

They have only been open a couple months in this location but it is definitely up and coming! The recipes are consistent and the flavor and quality is definitely reliable. No matter what time of the day you know you are getting a nutritious and delicious meal that your body will feel good about.

This brand promotes a healthy lifestyle without having to compromise on flavor. The price is quite affordable and proves value in the great portions you receive. This is a definite must try, again and again and again. =]"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars if not for two distinct factors.

1) Price: Although this is billed as a high quality clean eating place it should not be $14.99 for salads and entrees. There is precedence for this typeof food being offered at lower than \"Cheesecake Factory\" prices even though the 2 as far as nutritionally are way different. 

2) Ambiance: Its super clean inside however the presence of the cheap IKEA type tables that wobble and ultralight chairs gives it a \"cheap\" feel and ads to the issue of overall value with the high prices. 

Other than those two things - all of the food is very tasty and the service is very good. Owner / GM was super friendly and was excited to help patrons."}
{"text":"I ordered the muscle builder burger and PH Protein Pancake Combo. That came out to be $29! This place is definitely a little pricey but hopefully worth it! I ordered my food to go I couldn't wait to get to that Bison Burger! Let me tell you! It was worth the money and the wait! Ketchup or Ranch would have made this masterpiece better but would surely defeat the \"healthy\" purpose! This will definitely be a place I come back to. The Shakes looked amazing!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the service was very attentive and helpful. Not having been here before, I had to peruse the menu for awhile but they were patient with my questions. Being a \"protein\" house, with a lot of lifters and athletes who were in there when I visited, the high calorie count on most foods made sense...but were higher than I usually have for one meal. I ended up choosing the green monster cold press. It was tasty and hit the spot. You could use a spoon to eat the leftovers in the cup!  It's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. I had the breakfast steak and eggs at 4:30 PM. It was healthy, delicious, and quick.
Excellent service , great and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time in, good food selection. I had the collard green wrap with salmon. Really good flavor and freshly made. My wife had the Cajun bowl, she thought it was okay, it did not seem like they gave you a lot of food to go vs. dinning in. This is a spot I would definitely try again. I could easily go a 4, I need to order more items on the menu to get a good feel for PH. Stay tuned for the next visit."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the owners and how involved they are. The PH Burger is AMAZING and the staff are all so sweet. Very clean environment and a super popular place to grab healthy food quickly!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had a hard time deciding what to get, everything sounds good! As a vegan, it was nice to see options. Food came out in a good time and we all left full. I can't wait to try the vegan protein pancakes!"}
{"text":"You never know what to expect as new comer until you finally get here. Food was great, large portions, and reasonably priced. Staff was also very welcoming  and attentive."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place, the selection and the staff. Also, for what you get, I feel the prices are reasonable. I have visited PH twice now and both times the food was extremely bland and my meal came out cold. I did try adding sauces (tried both the BBQ and the Cilantro). Meh...underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The food is good, even very good... But the $16 price tag and 45 minute wait for a simple protein bowl was enough to make me search elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible first time experience.
I never leave a yelp review but wanted to share how bad our experience was.
Nice girl at counter (that's all)
Dirty, water cups not dried, out of all utensils, out of condiments, took forever to get food, came with the wrong items. Yuck. Won't be going back.:("}
{"text":"Great selection of food.  The two times that I have ordered food they forgot something.  The food is tasty and a good portion.  I do find it a little pricey."}
{"text":"After a good workout, i stopped but and found exactly what I was looking for! The food looked healthy and actually really good. I specifically came in for a green drink and walked out so pleased! The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity ! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was blown away.  Quick, clean and friendly.  Love how the menu is designed.  You know EXACTLY what you're getting.  This WILL be a regular spot for me, no question."}
{"text":"Love Protein House!  It is great if you are dieting or just trying to eat healthy.  Their menu has a wide variety to meet everyone's needs and if you do not see anything on the menu they can custom make you food.  I recommend the Thai Monster Bowl, BBQ Bison Cheesesteak, and the Chocolate Monster Pancakes.  The pancakes are where it is at!  The only knock would be that they do take a bit to make your food which is OK because they are making it from scratch.  The food is pricey for what it is though, all healthy food is.  When I diet I eat here on the regular so you can trust when I say check them out!

{"text":"We came for the first time and had the plant power bowl, build your own, Mayra's pancakes and south beach pancakes all excellent. The staff was friendly. We had a couple of forgotten ingredients and sides but they quickly fixed it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and the people are nice.. just very slow to get things done, took 20 minutes to get two smoothies, and no one else was in there."}
{"text":"The food was okay (kinda bland), the service was fine but nothing special. The place was clean. The one noticeable trait of this place is that it seemed a little cliquey amongst the workers and somewhat either unprofessional or inexperienced in their demeanor towards guests. I'd definitely come back, try something different and hopefully amend my review with something more positive!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is what I've been waiting for FOREVER! Healthy choices, availability to customize based on diet, sit down dining... I am so happy to have this down the street from me! Service was great, food was AMAZING!!!!! I've had the PH burger and the steak burrito and both blew my mind! I will be going to this restaurant at least 1 time each week! Thanks for brining this to Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Love it. The meat is sometimes a little dry but they do a great job overall. Love the healthy meals and you can have them split it into two portions so you have an extra meal for later. Great for meal prep or healthy lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Put in an order for meal prep pick up online. The website would not accept payment. When I called to ask to place my order over the phone I was told \"no we don't do that\" I asked for an exception because of the technical error for the website. I was then told \"ok I will for this one time but know we don't do that\" Placed my order to be ready at 12:30pm the following day. I ordered 12 meals. When I went to pick up....only 8 were ready. When I notified of the mistake they then handed my order back to me with only 10. When I notified them again the girl behind the counter and juice bar rolled her eyes. It is not over and hour and half passed my appointment time and they are still trying to prepare my food. I thought this would be a great place for me to have my meals made for me but it's clear they are under staffed, unprepared, unorganized and customer service is lacking tremendously. There was no offer for a refund not even an an apology from anyone on staff. When I asked for a manager she said there wasn't one. I'll be taking my weekly $130 order elsewhere."}
{"text":"The lean green protein team is friendly and helpful for delicious decision making! Tried the Mediterranean spinach wrap with grilled turkey burger, hummus, cucumber, tomato, and feta cheese with a side of sweet potato. Yum! 

Lots of good options from protein bowls, açaí bowls, shakes, smoothies, salads, burger, wraps, you name it.

Restaurant is clean but only gets 4 stars because the water station needs a good cleaning (hard water stains etc) and the patio hasn't been cleaned, swept, or dusted in a few days. Come on guys! It's beautiful out we want to be outside!  But the food is good stuff."}
{"text":"Sadly we had a bad experience the last time we visited. Pancakes are not a go to food at the Protein House in Gilbert. Had a lovely wrap the time before we went. This did put us off going there"}
{"text":"Fresh healthy food good tasting , attentive staff, good choices for vegan, low carb, athletes. You walk thru order and they bring it out. We were some what out of place. In our 60's not so athletic. Music is a little loud but fits their average age group. We were looking for a place to take our vegan daughter when she comes to vist, we thinks she would really like the selections."}
{"text":"8:30 Sunday morning, pretty empty place and the music was just a bit too loud. I'm sure the music is meant to energize you. Ordered a Titan shot and the PH Loaded Pancakes with all the fruit. Service was very quick and the food was fresh. The Titan shot was spicy and interesting - I wouldn't order again because of the price. But I think if you're on the edge of a cold, the Titan shot would scare it away. :) The pancakes were perfect. I am not usually a restaurant pancake person - most are too heavy, doughy, or worse. These were perfect. And actually, they looked fake - better than the pictures and they tasted better than they looked. Definitely going back to try more on the menu. Or maybe I'll just stick with those pancakes..."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is not fast food.If you are in a hurry order online first. I ordered a BBQ Bison wrap, it was $11.99, it comes with a fruit bowl as well. It was absolutely amazing! I'm truly in love with this place! The BBQ wrap was so tasty. The tortilla had a toasted crunch to it. The fruit salad was fresh and tasted great. I have read a few reviews saying they think it's over priced. The value is truly in the healthy ingredients. If you want a $5 meal that's not this place. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is okay! I enjoy the fact the food is healthy and has many vegan options, but I dinged it 2 stars because:

1. How fast the service is. It's either hit or miss in terms of how fast you get your food.
2. How expensive it is for the portion you're given 

I work next door to this place and once ordered to-go while i was working as my co-workers didn't mind me grabbing food while it wasn't busy. I was one of the first customers there as I got there right when it opened and after about 25 minutes and no food out yet, I asked one of my friends cashiering if she could just bring it to me cause it had been 25 minutes already on the clock out of work for me and I had to leave. She said she would and after about another 20 minutes still nothing came. It turns out they accidentally gave my food to another customer, and finally after an hour since originally ordering, I got my food. They gave me a card for a free meal as an apology and I really appreciated it. While I did receive this, I'm still disappointed to this day that the mix-up happened with only 3 customers in the entire store.

My co-workers will often want to get stuff on their break, as we're literally just a couple steps from it, but all of us agree that they're very slow  and we won't get the food and time to eat it within the break time. So all of them just order to-go and wait for it to be ready before going on break. If you're short on time, I would not suggest eating here or instead, order ahead. You never know if it'll take 5-10 minutes to get your food or 15-25 minutes. There's never any consistency for busy or dead times.

As for portion sizes, let me first state I respect their commitment to high quality ingredients and healthy food, but I think the price could definitely be lowered or in a more competitive range in comparison to other food businesses or they could make their portion sizes bigger.

Overall though, a very clean place, healthy food, good location, and kind staff. The only issues I think most people agree with amongst these reviews and amongst my co-workers is speed of service and prices."}
{"text":"The food here was really delicious, but the main issue I had was with the employees. Me and my friend walked in and no one greeted us. The guy at the front was very rude and short. Employees need to be given a few tips on customer service."}
{"text":"Arrived for the first time at this location at 8:20pm after an evening workout..let's just say I'm all about businesses creating a customer friendly experience, and upon walking in we receive nothing but cold stares and a very awkward ambiance. We were told drink concessions were already put away for the night and only water was available (I thought they closed at 9pm as that is what it says on their website). We order two hamburgers which came out to a total of $32 and that is with no drinks! Sitting waiting for our food one of the employees proceeded to put all the chairs up on the tables and  roll up all the carpets at this time it was only 8:25pm. 10 people came in after us having to look in between already put away tables and chairs for a seat. Short story is if you say you are open until 9pm and charge an arm and leg for a burger don't make your customers feel rushed to get out at 8:20pm. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We have tried protein house at this particular location numerous times. Every time we say to ourselves maybe next time will be a better experience. Well, today wasn't any better. I ordered a bowl with ahi tuna and they were given to me frozen. I had to take it back up to be cooked. In my experience you aren't suppose to frozen filets, they should be prepped and thawed out before hand. If your location doesn't have them prepped just say so and I'll order something else. We were told we would get 10% off the next time we come in. However, there won't be a next time. The Vegas location has it right and that's the location we love. I've contacted the owner of Gilbert location with no response. I'm not expecting anything but good service but unfortunately we haven't received it at this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoy places like this to eat, service was great and I loved the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu selection of healthy food after a workout, I especially crave the Muscle Boy breakfast."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Walked over after my workout and ordered a protein shake and açaí bowl. The atmosphere is nice but the attitude of each employee was so uninviting and I didn't see a smile the whole 30 minutes I was there. As I waited, and waited, and waited, the cashier seemed miserable and the others all acted like they were having the worst day! My shake was yummy but the bowl took 20 minutes. I watched the food come out and the burger looked amazing. I will try it one more time but my advice would be to smile and enjoy yourselves while you are working! I couldn't wait to get out of there!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try place for awhile. Well, we had the bison burger and it was pretty damn good. The sweet potato sticks are pretty yum as well.

I had a mixed greens, I was disappointed they didn't ask if I wanted dressing or not. Because the dressing is ok, but it was a bit much.

I will be going back to try other menu items.

It's between 12 to 16 dollars for a burger"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food, amazing service. Huge variety of choices. Excellent kids menu too.."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw they had been building it since I workout right next door. I had an apple jax protein shake and it was so good! The place is very nice inside and the staff seems great and I will definitely be back soon! Can't wait to try more items on the menu 

Update 2/1 : just ordered some food to go and the girl Jasmine that took my order was so nice and helpful, I'm not sure if it was the same girl at the register but she was such a sweetheart as well. Great staff"}
{"text":"I've been going to Protein House since it's opened and I've literally tried everything. Everything is sooo amazing!!!! The staff is so awesome and friendly. 
I'm a trainer at E?S next door and love how delicious quick and healthy the food is. I could sit here and write a long review on how much I love it but YOU need to come try it so you can fall in love!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEES KNEES! Healthy food and it tastes good?! This place has it all: protein shakes, nitro cold brew (MY FAVE!), meal preps, lean proteins and amazing service! I can't wait to go back. Located directly next to EOS, this place is going to kill it!"}
{"text":"My husband, 2 year old, and I LOVE this place! The menu is easy to read with macros listed. The pancakes are to die for. The breakfast sandwich is super filling. The pb shake we had was just the right amount of sweet. My 2 year old had chicken and sweet potato. The cashier girl was super helpful in finding a side option so we didn't have to pay for a full meal for our kid who clearly can't eat that much! They also offer meal prep options where you can pick up anytime you want. The customer service was amazing and the restrooms were clean- which to me is some of the most important things businesses need!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and I will say I like it..so far. The only issue I have is that the cooks need to know and understand proper meat temperatures especially when you're paying $17 a meal. I ordered \"The General\", med-rare and my meat was definitely WELL DONE and almost over cooked. 
I really like that the staff was friendly and I will definitely be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"this place is absolutely chilllll! i ordered the Greek yogurt bowl and it was quick service and the fruits were fresh, ripe, and ready to go. the location is on point just in case you want to go workout next door at the nearby gym. They also offered free wi fi so i was able to work as i enjoyed my tasty meal! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off, customer service was AMAZING. Every employee greeted me immediately when I walked in and the owner Tom, came up and personally introduced himself and helped me decide what to get. I'm vegan and they offer a lot of Vegan options and alternatives. Tom was very helpful with his suggestions.

Now the food, I got the Southwest Veggie burger with sweet potatoes and it was AMAZING. The veggie burger actually tasted like meat. I loved it!! 

Definitely will be spending a lot of my money on this place!"}
{"text":"Want great food without the guilt then you've gotta try this place. The wrap was great and the place was really clean. Glad to see a healthy option in the east valley."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, bright and has such a positive energy. I love the food. Lots of options. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes the person at the register is knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients and substitute options, but sometimes they are clueless about the menu.
It's pretty pricey, but the portions are big and the food is clean, whole ingredients, and everything I've had thus far has been delicious.  Even the kids menu is so good. Choices like Teriyaki Bowl, pancakes, and always comes with fresh fruit.
I've only had one meal that was sub-par. I ordered a salmon collard green wrap with dressing on the side which I had earlier in the week (see Pic). When I got home, opened my to-go box and it was salmon with collard greens just kinda plopped on the bottom and top of the salmon and no dressing at all. It still tasted good, but definitely not representative of the expectations for presentation from Protein House.
It's a franchise, but this is a locally owned business - you'll usually catch one of the owners, Tom, floating around greeting customers."}
{"text":"I say go here.  Yummy shakes :)

They offer a really great selection of protein drinks that have not been contaminated by kale or spinach vomits. Huge plus plus !!! Plus they will accommodate substitutions sans extra charges.  And... great place to get your protein right after gyming at EOS fitness next door!!"}
{"text":"So good!!!  The steak chopped salad is delicious. The food is fresh and super healthy."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few different times now. The PB&J Shake is my favorite. The omelet with cottage cheese is also really good. The South Beach pancakes are super tasty and a very large portion. Prices are a little high but I feel like the quality makes it worth it. They make things as you order so be patient. Two out of three times we have gone in people were complaining about the wait. We have never waited more than 10 minutes for food."}
{"text":"I love ProteinHouse! Everything I have had there was super fresh, delicious and I could eat it with zero guilt. The staff is very friendly. They take the time to explain the menu and offer suggestions. I have had the ninja burger, bison burger, cheesesteak wrap, and quite few different pancake dishes. Seriously everything has been sooooo yummy. I love it here."}
{"text":"Great name.
Whoever designed the menu location must be a chiropractor. You will need one after reading  it.
I only get the protein shakes and that takes forever.
Staff are all very nice but I don't think there is any training. No urgency, take their time. Just don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Love the food just recently found this place they definitely will have a new regular place is clean service is friendly and the steak wrap is delicious can't wait to try out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Love love love that I can finally go to a restaurant and maintain my low carb/keto lifestyle. It's a fresh and healthy environment that makes you want to keep going back. The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable with endless options even for someone like me that doesn't do the carb thing."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to eat right after your workout at Eos fitness! 

Finally coming to protein house has definitely changed my opinion to my go-to post workout meal! 

It's clean eating that will provide you with an array of options that makes you glad you didn't cheat on your diet! Their menu offers a lot of stuff like protein pancakes, burritos/wraps, protein bowls protein shakes, burgers, etc

My friend and I got the bbq bison wrap and the steak wrap and they were fantastic!  Pretty good portion, it's not gonna be HUGE but if you're on a diet, that's what you want. You just want to eat to get that satisfaction, not to feel bloated and overstuffed!

We also got some protein shakes, I got a PB&J smoothie while my friend got some kind of island pineapple one. His was definitely better than mine. 

Overall, I can't wait to try more food options at this place, definitely gonna come here for the other drink options as well as food options. I love how clean the place looks, as well as the efficiency of getting my protein and carbs in with the smartest food options. 

I would highly recommend coming here for your diet fix!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"delicious\"! I love that they have macros on all items listed. It's a bit pricy but that's to be expected for high protein, quality food. I wish they had a chandler location but definitely worth the drive for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Clean food that tastes good, and you can customize for dietary issues or specialized diets (keto friendly!). They were even able to do a vegan entree for my kid!  The menu is really enormous, you could legitimately eat there every day and not get sick of the food!"}
{"text":"It's a great concept, and I really appreciated that the food options came with calorie and macro counts, and that the product is probably very clean. No KAFO Meat I assume. But I won't eat there again, because they forgot one thing - flavor. Every person in my party had consult their food to try and make it taste better including the quesadilla."}
{"text":"A better (or equally accurate) name for this place would be \"FatHouse\". Virtually every entree comes with 45-70 grams of fat, often more fat than protein in fact. This feature is hidden from the customer, because they don't have any nutrition information available in the restaurant. You can go online and download a PDF to your phone if you'd like to know what they are actually serving.... Unless you want details on the sweet potato mash that comes with all of the burgers... They don't list that at all. It tastes like it has about a half-stick of butter, so that's probably why.

I finally ordered the aloha chicken sandwich. It was small and unsatisfying. It did taste okay though.

This place is the \"Jamba Juice\" of burger joints. It caters to people who just started their pilates class this week and want to pay a lot of extra money to eat somewhere that seems like it ought to be healthy. A McDonald's grilled chicken is cheaper, tastier, and healthier than almost anything on the menu.

Now I'm poorer, still hungry, and grumpy about the fact that my dinner is going to be small and restrictive if I'm going to get my targets for the day.

One star because they have fancy salt and pepper shakers.

edit: I'll respond to the owners response here: I visited yesterday (2/27/2018) and could not find any nutrition/macro information anywhere. I asked the young lady running the register if there was any available and she responded \"We don't have any of that here.\" I was eventually able to find (some) macro information on the website, obviously not for things like the sides, so I had to guesstimate for those."}
{"text":"We stopped in post workout and were ravenous, left still hungry. The portions are small, and half our food was missing or inedible. Let's start with two kids meals - teriyaki chicken bowl with fruit (missing fruit), and one kids bison burger with fruit. We noticed a white slimey substance on the fruit, super close to moldy. So we took it back up and asked for another side, they told us it was the fruit \"sluffing\" off on one another? No thanks. They returned with another side of fruit that looked an awful lot like it was just run under water, way too wet and thin to be fruit juice. Needless to say we didn't eat it. The adult Aloha burger was fine, but came with \"sweet potato mash\" which was more like steamed bland cubes? 
This is one of those places where they deliver your food to the table but never come back again - you get your condiments,napkins, water and such yourself, then put your dishes and trash away yourself. That's cool, but they have a 18 or 20% tip button while checking out (before you even get your food). Maybe it's just me, but I tip generously for someone to do that running. I just spent $8 for the 12 people behind the counter (not exaggerating) watched me clean up. Two stars because the juices were good and seemed fresh, but the mold incident is enough for me to pass."}
{"text":"Really good food! I had specific Macro goals the day I went and she was able to walk me through the whole menu quickly, making it easy for me to narrow down what I wanted. Very clean restaurant, friendly staff all the way around, owner was in clearing plates and delivering food...making conversation with each table. Will definitely be back soon! Great job all!"}
{"text":"The food is very inconsistent. I came here pretty often since it is convenient, but 9/10 the food doesn't taste the same as other locations.
Also,some of the staff here are very snotty.
As a positive person who smiles often, I am surprised to get the reaction here.
There is a lot of gossip i here the staff talking about. 
Not a very good environment, I recommend the Scottsdale location- surprisingly."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, many options, online ordering, close to my house.  It is all good!  I ordered a smoothie and a bowl.  Excellent quality!  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ate here it's good I guess I wasn't blown away by it. It seems over rated some what and is never lacking overly muscled dudes."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after the gym today. It seemed very clean and not busy at all--we did go in during the last hour. There are a TON of different food choices. We both got the Green Monster \"juice\". It was pretty good! We got the Muscle Boy and a build your own. Our total was over $40. Way too expensive for what is was worth. The portions were not that big and we both thought it was \"bland\". I would like to try out different food from there, but it will be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"If you leave there hungry, it's your own fault!

I had breakfast here last week with a friend and we didn't even know where to begin!  There's so many great choices, and everything is made to order.

The staff is incredibly friendly, and helpful, and one of the owners came by to check on us and see if we needed anything.

The cost is a little more than I'd usually choose to pay, but once I tried the food, it was definitely worth it.

If you're looking for a healthy alternative, give them a try.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! I had a veggie omelet and it was perfect and very filling. The matcha latte on the other hand was very bitter and was not what i was expecting"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been here twice to eat.Food was delicious. Hubby only eats organic and he was impressed with quality of the food. Decided to take the plunge and do food prep. Was a little confused about process but Beth( from St. Louis) was so helpful and patient even going to the back several times to verify specific requests with the cook. Most of the employees do greet you with a smile and seem genuinely happy to work there."}
{"text":"Yum! Great place to eat when you're trying to be healthy. Very clean and friendly service. Love that it is right next-door to my gym EOS too!"}
