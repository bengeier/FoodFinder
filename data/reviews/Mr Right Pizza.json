{"text":"My go to place for a Hawaiian pizza on a Saturday night. Wings are really great as well! They have a \"butter chicken pizza\" that is definitely worth a try! Way better than the grocery store frozen version!

Very friendly service - always a pleasant conversation when I pick up my order. 

They moved locations - formally at Dundas and Bathurst, now at Bloor and Crawford. Just a few minutes north west!"}
{"text":"I go for slices here and its always consistent....consistently good that is!
Large pizza with 3 toppings for $10 and its done right.   I suppose thats why they are known as Mr. Right."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Store! Can't get better than the deals and friendly service you get from anywhere but Mr. Right...better than just RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Price is great, best value in the city for decent pizza. The pizza is a nice thin crust and it is cooked well. 

It's better and cheaper than Dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Ordered from Mr. Right Pizza from just-eat.ca because the 2 for 1 pizza deal looked like a good deal.

My order was two large pizzas. Both thin crust: 
1. Pepperoni, mushroom, sausage
2. Ham, pineapple, anchovies

Cons:
- Delivery guy was ~30 mins late; perhaps I should have tipped more, and next time I will probably wait to tip at the time I get the order.

Pros:
- Pizza was very good, and really, for the price, I would say excellent
- Generous amount of toppings. The sausage is notable -- it was quite flavourful and not simply salty, as is too often the case.
- Nice chewy crust (I mean that in a good way) with just the right texture. 

I will be ordering from Mr. Right Pizza again! They have earned my business."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. I ordered their signature pizza and was called by the owner to ensure that I knew that their signature pizza did not come with cheese. He then recommended that I try half and half. The pizza was fantastic! After the pizza the owner then called back to see how I enjoyed the half and half! What great service. I would definitely recommend the pizza without the cheese - more authentic but I really enjoyed the half and half experience."}
{"text":"This pizza and doner joint seems to be focussing on pizza as I don't see much meat action on the spit. It used to be called Diyar Pizza I believe, but Mr. Right is a catchy name and should help get them noticed. I am always on the lookout for local pizza joints that take care making the best pizza and not just follow a formula. The toppings are nicely chopped, the sauce is tangy and the crust is not chewy and is in the goldielocks zone for thickness. The staff look to be owner/operators and have always greeted me with warm smiles. They explained to me that my pizza was cooked in the better oven of the two, the one that gives the optimum slow cooked results. There are some Turkish items on the menu that I haven't tried but look interesting. I recommend this pizza for anyone near Dundas and Bathurst and they deliver too."}
{"text":"Worst pizza hands down. I received lousy service on the phone, they didn't seem to know what I wanted to order even though I was reading from their flyer, when the pizza finally got to my house it was 50 mInutes later and cold. There was very little flavor to it, and extremely greasy. The free Pepsi with the order were tasty. Highly do not recommend"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! The crust is soft, the cheese is thick, the toppings are fresh and plenty. 
Since the first night my partner and I moved in to the neighbourhood we've made this pizza a weekly treat. We usually get two XLs, which I like more than the party pizza. 
Sure, the delivery time is a bit longer than some places but the wait is well worth this pizza."}
{"text":"Mr. Right Pizza?  More like Mr. Right Now.  

I have only eaten here in those desperate days before payday, when I need a quick bite to eat but the cold prohibits a trek to better slices. The pizza is just strangely dry, gummy, and otherwise unpalatable. Props for having vegan options, but there is not a lot of other good things I could say. Sigh."}
