{"text":"The food and service was excellent. Get the Chicken Alfredo! My only complaint would be that the wonderful, very talented band was too loud. My friends and I could not hold a conversation due to the noise level. It was a Saturday night, so I loved the entertainment, but if that could change, this place would definitely be the \"go to\" place for my husband and I and our friends."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere. It is quaint and upscale cuisine. The owner is very hands on and attentive."}
{"text":"We had a party of 20 so service was, well we only had one server it wasn't the fastest, I've had slower plus we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was presented well but absolutely no flavor, honestly none of us were happy about our meals. I've been here before when it was Jezebels and had a much better experience. Also, there were a shit ton of flies flying around, which was gross as hell! Yeah they tried  their best but Zanzibar and Take 5 are must better options. They need a better cook!"}
{"text":"This place is a mess! The owner did not tell the workers about the event my niece and nephew had scheduled. They did not take orders for food for more than an hour and a half. They even told people to come to the hostess stand to put in orders for our table. By the time they got to take my order (2 hours later) I no longer was interested in spending my hard earned money in such a poorly run establishment. Zero stars! Do not go!"}
{"text":"The service is awful. I went on a Friday, there were several entr√©es they didn't have. Myself and several others never received our orders. The people that received they're orders stated the food was cold. They didn't have juice to make the signature cocktails on the menu. I saw some one come in with Daves supermarket bags. I really wanted to like this place. No corn, Brussel sprouts, ran out of mashed potatoes and tomatoes . My husband and I order the stuffed salmon, the waitress came back 10 minutes later to inform me that there was only one piece is salmon left. I ordered the pasta Alfredo instead, we never received our order. The manager Remy was very irritated because patrons were complaining.  On a positive note the live entertainment was awesome."}
{"text":"Ambience was excellent, the manager was exceedinglying professional and pleasant.I had the gourmet cheese burger which was absolutely great, one of best burgers I have had in a long time; she had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich of which she declared was excellent. Looking forward to coming again."}
