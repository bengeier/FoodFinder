{"text":"Found this place purely by chance and I'm glad I did!

This is a take-out place ONLY.

Food is excellent, flavours are great.  I usually order the Chicken Chow Mein with Blackbean Sauce and some Sesame Chicken which is more than enough for two people.  
It's reasonably priced and all good.  I've tried a couple of other dishes too and they have all been excellent except the sweet and sour which was too sweet for my taste.

Overall, a great place to order in from."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the prices at this place have gone through the roof lately, and the food just isn't worth the cost anymore. I won't be back. A 12% increase is not justifiable."}
{"text":"Really tasty food for a great price! Very fast delivery. Many food choices. 

The delivery is 3$, or free for orders 20$+. 

For now it is my favourite Chinese delivery place."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried rice with chicken. The batter was standard in terms of  taste but it did not have the deep fried crispy batter. I ordered for takeout on a cold day so I'm not sure if that was a factor in the chicken wings being not too soggy but definitely not crispy. I would give it another try, the cashier was nice and worked with great pride in terms of greeting customers that are walk in and also on phone take out orders."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place. It's honestly hit or miss every time I go. First time it was amazing, 2nd and 3rd time it was rather greasy, burnt, and not all that good. Staff is really nice though so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here and got Cantonese chow mein, chili chicken and fried rice. The chow mein was good but the other two dishes were pretty bad. Chili chicken was breaded and fried but the sauce made it soggy and gross. There was also no spice to it. Fried rice tasted burnt and not very fresh. Tried for the first time, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. Very fast delivery and the food was really good - we went for the dinner for 3 special. The food is great and it doesn't seem to have the saltiness that other Chinese takeouts seem to have. The chicken balls were also excellent and weren't batter-heavy like with other restaurants. The only compliant was that their egg rolls weren't very good."}
{"text":"This place is great! I find most items we order fairly fresh and not too greasy. They pack them well and are not shy on portions. When you place an order over $20 delivery is free and over $40 you get a free fried rice or chicken wings. Service is good. 4/5 stars because I think some menu prices are high and they could be a little more competitive there."}
