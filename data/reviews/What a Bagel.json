{"text":"Best. Brunch. Ever.

I highly recommend: making your own omelet, the nutella pancakes, any sandwich, and the eggs benedicts."}
{"text":"I highly reccomend coming here for breakfast. Good deals. Food is as good as your typical diner: sandwhiches, eggs benedict, pancakes, etc..."}
{"text":"Thought this place was just so so. But for sure a lot of stuff are overpriced. The people are friendly but I honestly feel like the place is a scam. Won't return."}
{"text":"I agree with Mariko M., Melinda M. and other comments about the rudeness of the staff.  I have been to this place a few times but recent event made me realize that the store do not deserve my business.

Agree - their bagels are really good but the staff are so rude - I am starting to wonder what kind of management this business has.  The staff members absolutely have zero customer service skills.  They all look miserable and never smile at all.  The place is also filthy.  Tables left uncleaned. Floors unmopped.  I think they only clean the place once a day - in the evening during closing time.  

I also agree with one of the comments here about the price.  The place is not cheap.  

During busy hours, paying is a chaos.  There is only one line for soup, salad, bagel, coffee - all the way to the cashier so, yes, you can be held up.  The staff would not care if you have been standing there for 10 minutes or 30 minutes.  The line is so inefficient yet no one bother to fix it or even streamline to make the flow goes smoothly.   They should learn from Tim Hortons in downtown financial district on how to handle 'real, busy time'. 

Yes, their bagel may be delicious but I am a strong believer of good service.  There are other places at Yonge and Eglinton that can match the price (if not better) with more cheerful and service-oriented staff plus a clean, wholesome place to eat.

And gosh!  They should send their staff to a customer service seminar of some sort!"}
{"text":"What A Bagel is a somewhat grungy joint that resembles something like a cafeteria. They make their own bagels and baked goods -pastries, danishes, holiday treats, challah bread, cookies etc. They have a small grocery section that includes juices, dips, wraps, soups etc. In addition, they have a brunch bar where you can be served things such as sandwiches, cheese blintzes, pancakes, omelettes, coffee and much more. They have a variety of things to choose from, the portions are good and the prices are reasonable. However, the food is not fresh and the quality is rather poor.

The bagels and pastries are placed out in the open on trays or in bins and it's really unsanitary. I've seen many people cough or sneeze into the goods or even use their hands to pick out the bagels from the bins instead of using the tongs. Also, the bagels are not always fresh, and sometimes sweet in a weird way as if something was mixed into the flour by accident. Pastries have been stale plenty of times and the challah bread almost always tastes grassy because it was going mouldy- gross! Only around Jewish holidays does the challah bread taste decent. 

It just gets worse. The dining area is almost always messy and surrounded with loud people. Crumbs, stickiness and wetness is found all over the tables and floors. The staff behind the counter are friendly and efficient most of the time. However, I've noticed that whenever the manager or supervisor is not present, the cleaning staff decides to slack off. The guy who makes the bagels during the week in the afternoon is the one who cleans the place and doesn't really care about taking care of the place. When asked to clean the dining area, he had attitude and reluctantly went to the dining area and used a dry dirty cloth to wipe down the tables.

Overall, What A Bagel provides a variety of baked goods and food with nice portions and reasonable prices, but their lack of quality and freshness in their ingredients and unsanitary surroundings does not leave me satisfied as a customer."}
{"text":"Rancheros Benedict on pumpernickel, a breakfast of Mexican champinos! 

This Location is always consistent, comfortable and attentive. I always order eggs benedict and it's always delicious. Sometimes they come up a bit short on the hollandias portions, but the cream cheese makes up for it. They have a great house salad, upgrade to the WAB, and a salad menu that is customizable. 

I would recomend this breakfast/ lunchfast spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty bagels. Pretty cheap. You can make your own sandwich. Very, Very crowded on weekends mornings. We usually just take out and eat at home."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town and fabulous desserts. I love the cream cheese and speed of service is fantastic"}
{"text":"Probing the best place to have a healthy breakfast. The bagels are always fresh and hot, the salads are very good and the eggs Benedict with salmon are are to die for."}
{"text":"They have amazing bagels and because they are always busy the food is always fresh. 

The sit down brunch is really great and tasty. The takeout bagel counter is my favorite you can choose what you'd like in your sandwich in the moment, they always stuff it so it's a filling sandwich and it's really tasty and fresh!

The prices are great too! Service isn't wonderful but could be because they are always busy there. I'm at the bagel counter at this location or the bathurst and steeles location at least once a week and the quality of food never dissapoints."}
{"text":"I've been here every weekends as I live close by. Food was okay, but service wasn't pleasant each time I was here. Long line up at the front to order and to pay, but no cashier... The cashier came out from the kitchen after a while, so I ended up waiting for over 10 minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get my food. Sometimes they forgot my food in the kitchen so I had to ask them to check, and when I got my food, it's already cooled down. I tried to order by phone, but they couldn't hear me on the phone for some reason (I'm sure my phone was working properly as there's no problem calling anyone else). So I gave 2 stars for the food, no star for their service. Hope it gets the owner's attention."}
{"text":"OMG, best...tuna...sandwiches...ever! I ordered mine on a small challah roll and made record timing devouring it. They have a great selection of bagels, rolls, etc and a simple yet satisfying menu. The staff are really friendly and it's conveniently located on Eglinton W. 

The only thing is that because of its size, this place feels more like a bakery, where you order something and take it home. It does offer a small section with tables but probably can't seat more than 6 people at one time. There is a picnic bench conveniently located right outside, which is seasonal as you can imagine.

I haven't been to their other locations but I'm sure their bagel/sandwich selection is just as good. If you're ever in the neighbourhood and fiending for some good eats then make sure to pop on by to this little bagel hotspot."}
{"text":"Pure stupidity and poor service. We go to what a bagel quite frequently. I ordered a caeser salad to go asked for the bagel toasted. I had already paid when I wanted just a little butter. They never asked ahead of time. So they were going to charge me for a little pack of to go butter. How stupid!!! If we were at the restaurant, they would have just given it to us. I wasn't about to use my credit for tiny sliver of butter!!!"}
{"text":"We walked from our hotel but unfortunately they were closed for business:(. Looks like they packed up and are gone!"}
{"text":"This is not the most beautiful place in the world. 
Everything looks very old and deteriorated
However, the bread is DELICIOUS! All bagels, challas, biscottis and pastries are excellent.
Good food, but eat it somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of the bagels here, but I stopped in for a cookie, and I was very happy! Not giant-sized, but rather a proper cookie size, and delicious at that.

The store is spacious, with a good variety of baked goods (and lots of bagels, of course). Seating area is available, and the store wasn't very busy when I was in there.

The cookie was also decently priced at 83 cents, tax in."}
{"text":"The food is great but I have a big concern is that there are many flies in that place and bagels and pastries are exposed so this is a health concern and hope that this will be taken into consideration.  Did anyone experience the same?"}
{"text":"Picked up a lunch for 10 people from this location, for an important business meeting.

Clients loved it, much better than pre-made sandwiches.

Everyone got something delicious that worked for them."}
{"text":"There are several locations of this chain, but there's something special about the Yonge and Eglinton joint. I never miss an opportunity to stock-up on their freshly made bagels and cookies (soft morsels of perfection), but the tuna salad is what I really love. They have mastered the art of an otherwise uninteresting sandwich staple- their tuna salad is fluffy, zesty, and truly delicious. 

I highly recommend getting the tuna salad on challa bread next time you're in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to receive exceptional customer service in a pleasant dining setting this is NOT the place. In fact, you'll be lucky to receive minimal service or close to decent service (with servers yelling at you from a far) at What A Bagel. 

The wait to be seated was absurd (roughly 30 mins) and it was no secret that people were cutting the line (regardless of the waiting list). 

If you're looking for delicious food served in such rush this may be the place for you - assuming you too are in as much of a rush. 

It's very clear that their prime concern is not your experience at What A Bagel. This company appears to be worried about how fast they can flip tables and increase profit. 

Overall input: They operate as a fast food business... That being said, they would be best off without the ignorant servers. 

Though, the food was good (being an understatement) - one star for that!"}
{"text":"Come here for the freshest & cheapest bagels you'll ever find in Toronto! 

For 99 cents, you'll get your bagel toasted and buttered, with the option of combo-ing it up with a cup of coffee. If you wanted to try out their various types of cream cheese, it's a lot more expensive. Your breakfast will tally up to around $3.50, but the cream cheese here is so good, you can also purchase them in a carton. 

I agree that the service is somewhat grumpy but they sure move fast - perfect for me (always rushing into work late..). 

The best thing is: 
You get a dozen FREE bagels on your birthday! Just remember to bring ID."}
{"text":"I came here because St Urbain is closed on Mondays and I didn't realize that and I really wanted a bagel. 

What a Bagel's bagels are okay, but not the best bagel I've ever had. They're a bit on the salty side and they're missing that great bagel chew that you'd get with a classic Montreal-style bagel like a St. Urbain's bagel. 

Better than Tim Horton's bagels, absolutely, but not something I'd go out of my way to get. They do have a good selection of bagel flavours."}
{"text":"I am with Melinda M. I have been there twice.  The prices are really high,. and the service people are truly rude.  I got a soup and sandwich and paid over $15 and they acted like I was bothering them.   Second time i was there 10 minutes before closing. Everything was put away and there was no coffee and they made it clear they were not going to make any.  They have nice bagels and baked goods, but I can get just as good across the street at Metro without the attitude."}
{"text":"We added this to our tour of greasy spoons in the city, only because it has a typical breakfast special (2 eggs, home fries, toasted bagel and side salad - no meat) for under 7 bucks, but this type of breakfast is definitely NOT it's specialty.

If you want greasy spoon, go up the street to Mars, The Sunset Grill or Good Bite, but if you want tasty pastry, bagels, cream cheese, lox and the like, this is your place.

Other What A Bagels would earn 4 stars for their quality of food and baked goods...this one loses a star for it's outdated and unattractive decor. It really needs a makeover."}
{"text":"eh. nothing special. wont be back"}
{"text":"Generally, I like the components of the \"What A Bagel\" chain.  Decent, fresh bagels, good traditional (Jewish) pastries and great stuff for the bagels.  A variety of cream cheese, and above average tuna and egg salad.  Some have an excellent salad \"bar\".  (Not self-serve, but made to your preferences.)

This one, however, seems like a stock room for one of the nicer ones.  It's small, cluttered and a bit frayed around the edges.  The basic ingredients (bagels, toppings) are of the same quality, but just in much smaller quantities and selection.

The moral?  Don't come here expecting the WAB at Leslie and York Mills or Yonge and Eglinton.  If you want some bagels to go or a quick tuna sandwich, this place will do."}
{"text":"Sometimes on my way home to North York, I will venture off the subway at Eglinton just to get a bagel (or other delicious baked good).

Again, my tastes are bland, but their plain bagels with cream cheese are hmm-hmm-good. I also love their cookies and chala bread. All the baked goods are equally impressive. 

A friend was once disappointed with the pre-packaged fruit salad...

Around lunch there are a LOT of high school kids that hang out and take up most of the seating, but if you're on the run, it doesn't matter much. The service can be a teensy bit slow, but a delicious bagel quickly makes up for that."}
{"text":"Breakfast for kings !!! Omelette with cheese is on point, there bagels are the best in the city."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of these locations, and while the food at this one was equal to the others, everything else was not so much. It just felt kind of run down in there, which is weird for the area since there's so much money around. And there's a faded, old Harry Rosen ad on the wall behind the counter. When asked about it, the woman working there told me 'oh, it's the owner's son - he's a model.' Well, good for him. If you're proud enough to put the ad on the wall of your business that's completely unrelated to it though, maybe you could at least put it in a frame so it's a little nicer looking?"}
{"text":"What a bagel is my absolute favs! The bagels are freshly made everyday - the tuna salad is amazing! I always get the pumpernickel bagel with tuna but they have other kinds. Great selection and great service!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! 

Pros
Good tasting food 
Well priced 
Good service 

Cons 
VERY busy on weekends. 
House salad is pretty mediocre"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourites for breakfast or lunch. Food is delicious, service is excellent and the atmosphere fun. Never need to wait for a coffee refill which has spoiled me for the service in other restaurants. Staff especially are extremely competent and friendly. Love the house salad with dressing and the tuna on a bagel. Favourite bagel is multigrain, but they all taste good. Love What a Bagel."}
{"text":"What a bad is great! Not sure why I haven't co e here before. 

You get to pick your own bagel off the rack and the. Bring it to the cashier. Bagels are so warm and fresh right off the rack. You have the option of getting it toasted as well. 

Once the bagel had been brought, someone will cut it for you, and add the toppings of your choice."}
{"text":"I shouldn't be rating this place because I have such mixed feelings about it. On one hand it has excellent bagels and fresh toppings. I used to love getting the multigrain with egg salad and veggies in the morning. On other hand, their sanitary (or unsanitary) conditions during last summer made me avoid it altogether. I used to get onion bun for my husband, his favourite, and those little delicious pastry rolls thingies with different fillings. One sad hot day we went in, and 10 fruit flies flew out of the onion bun, then a few more from another. The place was full of them actually. My husband pointed the issue to the counter staff, but they were sort of dismissive, saying it was hot outside hence the fruit flies. I can't make myself go there again. I miss my multigrain with egg salad and those little delicious pastry rolls thingies. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Friday during spring break so restaurant was relatively empty but business was picking up as we were wrapping up. We had bagels (served with tons of cream cheese on the side so you can put as much or as little as you want), waffles (very delish and lots of fruit/whipped cream), pastries, coffee, and hot cocoa. All food was good and service was lovely. Cool decor and whatever problems they may have been having with pricing being displayed is history (see pictures of menu boards)."}
{"text":"I'll keep the review brief.

Speedy service, clean, friendly staff, great triple decker grilled cheese sandwich with home fries. Only issue is that the waitstaff never came back to refill the water. That takes away a star."}
{"text":"What-a-bagel has the most delicious breakfast/lunch/brunch food (open till 3pm), which is not an option at all the locations. I don't even go anywhere else. Lots of options, and everything is healthy and delicious. Everything on the menu is great. The coffee is also my favourite. The service is always good. The place gets really busy on the weekends, and sometimes there is a wait, but its worth it! Bagels are the best I've ever had, and the pastries are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is starting to nickel and dime you 
I went in and grabbed 2 twist bagel ask for cream cheese and butter on both. The lady behind the counter starts telling me besides the bagel and cream cheese I have to spend .85 more for the butter. I said to her just a little bit of butter. I could of bought a whole brick for that. Been their lots of times and never had this item charged, she said new rules and not trying to reason with me. I told her I feel you are Nickel and Diming  me, she ran to the back after 1 bagel with hardly any cream cheese and scraped the cream cheese that was left out of a take out tub then left the first bagel on the counter to run back to
get someone in the back to come up front. I got frustrated and fed up as she is now wasting my time I walked out. If there is a next time and you eat in there they probably will charge you for the jam in the sit sound area. This is my second incident at this place.  Lost my business for good. Real problem with the way staff talks to there customers."}
{"text":"Solidly meh.

The so so: the bagels are often fresh. They are decent bagels. Not the best, but definitely better than the supermarket variety. 

The bad: The bagels, pasteries, spreads and sandwiches are overpriced. 

I have no qualms with the staff. They aren't friendly, but they are efficient. The owners, however are offensive. I recently came in pushing my kids in a stroller. Their friends (I assume) were sitting at the one available table outside the store. Their dog was sitting blocking the entryway. When I attempted to enter the store, the owner, who was busy talking to these people, snapped at me to be careful of the dog. I was attempting to navigate between the dog and the table, but she was not interested in helping me, as a customer pushing a stroller. She preferred to be rude to me. I was disgusted. Left. And tried bagel brigade a few days later. A much much much better option."}
{"text":"All the hot sandwiches are amazing. Chicken schnitzel is a family fav.  Great prices and the owners are so nice.  Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I always come here to lunch with my friends. They have fresh bagels and many things you can have with them. The little bakery section is good for cookies and such. Just make sure you get there before rush hour time otherwise your gonna end up waiting for a while!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in on my birthday, the following brief conversation occurred between me and the lady at the counter:

Me: \"Hi, I heard a rumour that--\"

Lady: \"Birthday bagels? Go get twelve and bring them here with your ID.\"

Me: \"K.\"

I loaded up a giant brown paper bag with twelve bagels, which were sadly cold, but I did arrive around 5 or 6. Marble bagels? Bring 'em. Cinnamon and raisin? Hell yeah. Chocolate chip bagels! Five of those. With the enormous selection (at least, to a bagel newbie like myself...) I tried to snag one of every variety I had never heard of. 

On the other side of the bagel \"aisle\" were a bunch of sweets that I could barely resist...Some kind of tiny, filled pastry oozing with chocolate, fruit, or some other kind of sugary goodness. It was all I could do to keep my hands off. Too bad I had just indulged at the nearby La Bamboche.

Anyway, true to the counter lady's word, I flashed my ID at her and was on my way with my bagels. If you saw a weird lady that day carrying bagels in a giant bag and munching the chocolate chip bagel in her hand on the subway, yup, that was me.

(They were reaallllly good.)"}
{"text":"My go-to spot on the weekend.. but get there EARLY as the line can get (and will most likely be) very long... Sometimes a 30-40 minute wait (but for good reason).

What a Bagel has several locations, this one being my favourite.  I find one of their other locations, particularly at Bathurst St. and Rutherford Rd. to be quite small, and with poorer overall service. 

What a Bagel has never disapointed me, and I've ordered many items off of their menu including their famous WAB Salad, Fruity WAB Salad, Vegetarian Omelette, Chicken Breast Wrap, Tuna Avocado Wrap, Greek Salad, Sweet Potato Fries, and of course their unique make-your-own salads!  They also have flat bagels (\"Flagels\") that are unique to What a Bagel, and are delicious! I find their regular bagels to be more \"doughy\" than some of their other competitors like St. Urbain.  I guess it's all particular preference though...

Nothing ever disappoints, and you can be guaranteed a great meal here... Great spot for breakfast or brunch with some friends or the family."}
{"text":"Bagels here are pretty good. Soft yet crunchy but 4 stars bc a small everything with vegetable creamcheese turned out to $4! A little over priced but the person that made my bagel was very generous with the creamcheese. I would def come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning with my mum! What a treat:) the bakery side looked amazing, lots of fresh sweets and bagels. The restaurant part was small but enough seating for the amount of customers in there. Pretty busy for a weekday morning. Me and my mum shared the salmon platter which would've been more than enough for the both of us, possibly even 3 people if you added an additional 2 bagels. We also got the french toast with bananas and strawberries. The toast was good but not worth getting again personally. The salmon platter was extremely generous and filling, we left stuffed for just under $20 a person including two cappuccinos. Thanks WAB for a yummy and super fresh breakfast! I also noticed a few of the customers who had sandwiches that looked amazing, definitely a must to try next time were in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast or lunch. A Jewish take on a deli breakfast. (No bacon or ham here but with so many other good choices you don't miss it.) Super fresh salads with a long list of ingredient choices. Their sandwiches are delicious. If you're looking to indulge the Avocado Grilled Cheese is heaven. It comes with fried eggs, tomato, avo and cheese on challah bread. It literally melts in your mouth. Shakshuka is one of my staples here. Eggs poached in a tomato stew/sauce topped with goat cheese and served with pita. Their waffles are delicious, served with mounds of fresh fruit and maple syrup. Noise is a factor here it can be difficult to hear your table mates. Staff are friendly and helpful and always willing to make your visit pleasant."}
{"text":"I really really love this place!
the variety of bagels they sell is satisfying: bagels with onion, sesame seeds, chocolate chips, poppy seeds, plain, marble bagels and many many more!!!

they also sell lots and lots of different sweet pastries (Yum!) and baguettes.

there is also a corner with salads and other snacks and foods but I rarely stop there.

and it's also a cafe where you can enjoy one of self picked bagels with whatever stuffing you want (fresh veggies, cream cheese, different types of meat and all of it can be grilled or not) 

but the best part....wait for it... they give you a bag of dozen bagels (you pick them yourself) on your birthday!=))"}
{"text":"They have fairly good bagels, and decently priced if you take them to go. 
However, if you get condiments and cream cheese the prices go up like crazy. 
I'll stick to Tims until I can afford this place."}
{"text":"Wow what a rip off this place is.  On their menu they showed $.080 cents for a single bagel.  I wanted to have cream cheese on it but didn't see a price for it.  But I asked for it anyway and then they charged me $4.08 after taxes!  I can't believe for a single swab of cream cheese they charged me this much!  I asked them to confirm if the price is right for a single bagel with cream cheese and they said yes.  What a rip off.  Even Tim Hortons charges a fraction of this price and their bagels are just as fresh."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not.

I was jonesing a pastry the other day so I went in around four o'clock. By this time there wasn't much left. A good sign, I thought. They sold most of their products.

Initially I was thinking of getting a bagel, but there were flies around them. The chocolate croissants luckily had no flies in sight so I picked one up. The line was held up because some annoying patron kept asking questions... couldn't wait any longer ! I started eating the croissant in line. To my disappointment, it was stale and gross. 

The gross pastry cost me $4. It was not edible that I ended up throwing out my purchase because I just could not continue eating it.

You'll be okay skipping this place."}
{"text":"They have amazing bagels  And there cream cheese is phenomenal  you should definitely try it oh I recommend the rainbow bagels if they have it"}
{"text":"This is my local What a Bagel, and I have to say it is positively different from most other locations I've tried, especially for dining in.

Most of the servers are \"lifers\", and for me it is always the first sign of a good place, and good management, treating their employees with respect.

The food is just amazing (which is why going there for breakfast on a weekend is a nightmare - waiting times are up to an hour, sometimes). Is it worth waiting for an hour? Yes, yes, and yes again!

Been there many, many times, and will visit many times again."}
{"text":"The first time my mother brought home 'what a bagel', I asked her \"why don't you buy a whole bag from the grocery store for like 3x less $?\" then I took a bite and my life was changed. The bagels... they are magic!!! How did they make it so amazing? Did they sell their soul to the devil for this delicious, crispy but doughy, warm delicious bread with a hole?! Goodness sakes.

This is my first visit into the actual store instead of begging my mom to constantly bring home bagels so I can wake up happy. This location is pretty big with a restaurant part & a take out part. Of course, me rushing to school, went to the take out part and got my favourite bagel - the pumpernickel (which I didn't know was pumpernickel and had to refer to it as 'the brown one', which got a chuckle from the lady.) The transaction went smoothly and the ladies working were nice, even though I know they are quite tired, working in the breakfast industry with hungry and grumpy customers in the morning. There are many different flavours of cream cheese and I settled on the dill one, which was delicious. I know my family is obsessed with the regular western cream cheese and even bring it home all the time. The quality of the food they offer is just spectacular. 

Ps. shoutout to all the lost sesame seeds that fell on the floor in the transaction of the bagel going into customer's brown bags.. those poor guys never had a chance."}
{"text":"YIKES! I would be perfectly fine with this place if it wasn't for the rudeness of the checkout witch. She yelled at me, interrupted me and ignored me. She would ask a question about what I ordered (well, yell a question) and then interrupt me to ask the same question to the counterperson. Really, don't ask me if you don't want my answer. She treated me like a criminal, like she thought I would lie about what I ordered to shave cents off what I pay. Damn.

I could not wait to get the hell out of there. The bagels were pretty good but nothing warrants this kind of treatment."}
{"text":"Great bagels, great service, great prices buy 6 get 6 free for take out
Nice dine in space available also!"}
{"text":"This new addition to the What A Bagel locations is wonderful!

I love all of their locations and melt in your mouth bagels that are soft and warm. 

However, this new location has an eatery so you can have a nice brunch, lunch or snack in a seated atmosphere.  As well, they have a more plentiful menu to please any lunch crowd.

And just think.... once you are done your meal, you can pick up some food to take home to enjoy.

As for personal favourites, I highly recommend their tuna or egg salad on a nice bagel or one of their bourekas stuffed with potato filling."}
{"text":"What A Bagel has been the go-to brunch spot for my boyfriend and I for about a year.  We usually go to the location at Richmond/Spadina, however, we were in Vaughan the morning after a wedding and were really craving What A Bagel.  We decided to try this location and it did not disappoint!  It is much bigger than the location we typically frequent, however, just as busy!  We arrived around noon to a crowded waiting area.  The hostess told us we could expect a 20 minute wait (which was less than I thought!).  We ended up waiting just over 20 minutes.  This location looks fairly new and is really clean.  Despite how busy it was we were served very quickly.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing - the \"Optimal Omelette\" (egg whites, spinach, diced tomato and goat cheese), a house salad and flax bagel.  The omelette was delicious (and a nice change, as the Spadina location does not have this on the menu).  Despite being made with egg whites it was still fluffy and really flavourful.  The dressing (although being a little too thick to pour over the lettuce) was really flavourful!
To top it all off, I don't typically enjoy the coffee at What A Bagel, but this location serves good coffee!  I'm not sure if it's because they serve Illy (maybe the Spadina location serves something else?) but I was pleasantly surprised.
I would definitely return to this location if I am ever in the area and am craving brunch!"}
{"text":"What started off as a hunt to find that fresh baked bagel, to that coveted rainbow bagel (for those needing their social media fix) did not disappoint. The owners wife talked me thru most of their pastries and deserts they offer. Offered tastings and have suggestions. Offers a good selection for all! They offer an array of cream cheeses, dessert pastries as well as savory and so much more. Was most definitely worth the drop in."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/lunch/brunch place ever. I have been coming to this What A Bagel location since it opened and I have never had any complaints about anything other then the occasional waiting to get a table, but it's always worth it. I have tried just about everything on the menu and everything is made fresh and tastes incredible. 

I highly recommend this place, and if you're not lucky enough to get a table right away there is always fresh baked goods inside the bakery which is attached to the What A Bagel Eatery. 

(P.S. Open till 3pm. Lots of parking.)"}
{"text":"What a bagel is to bagels and cream cheese as to what Leonardo Di Vinci is to art. 

It's seems like they've perfected the combination of food, service and quality to create a perfect formula for success. 

From my understanding to visits all across town, they are not all built equal - meaning that some of them are franchises (and quite frankly - those franchisees cut a few corners). The main locations that I go to held by the owners of the company are absolutely exceptional. 

This particular location is busy - like crazy busy - all the time. Fresh tasty bagels, delicious creamy cream cheese, warm breakfasts, cream cheese/egg salad plates all for a very reasonable price for what you get. 

Their coffee is bottomless and it is delicious. I've been coming here for years and will continue to do so."}

Long table seating for 8, then another 6 tables for 2."}

The outside has a satisfying crunch and a bit sticky and the inside is soo moist and flakey. Its like I died and went to coconut hevean! Mmm I always go and pick up 12 at a time and bring them home :)

I also tried the roastbeef sandwich on a bagel. The bagel is nice, sanwich tasted fresh which is great. Better than a Subway sandwich that's for sure :)"}

I have the bagel+minestrone soup combo (~$6) and my gf had the salmon+egg+onion+tomato bagel with sweet potatofries (~$10). 

The entire meal was very well done and I felt that this was a perfect way to start a morning. The server forgot to serve butter to go with my bagel but I reminded her and it was brought to me promptly. I took a bite from my girlfriend's bagel and it did taste very good and they certainly didnt skimp out on any ingredients. I liked the touch with adding capers w/ the salmon. 

Overall I think this was a great restaurant especially compared to the one on Thornhill. I didnt really like the one over there as much. 

I do wish they provided better prices because at the end of the day it is just a bagel and soup. ... tim hortons could offer similar for less than 5 bucks with a coffee. But it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"The standard order...

\"I'll have the Veggie Omelette.  Yes,  The one with onions, green peppers and mushrooms.  But instead of mushrooms can I please have salmon slices... and instead of the green peppers, can I please have apples... and instead of the onions, can you please substitute Goji Berries?   Great.   Do you do egg whites?  Well, I don't want those... I'd prefer egg beiges... mostly white with some yellow.  You know what, don't use eggs at all.  Just heat up some soy milk and use a teaspoon of olive oil to make it settle right.   Oh, and instead of a salad can I please have some tofu cubes and spanish eggplant marmalade?   And can you serve it all in a waffle cone?\"

This is substitution city.  A land where nothing is what it seems.  

They really should consider just creating a fill-in-the-blanks menu.  It would be so much easier.    I think that it's somewhat of a joke... almost as if the whole community is trying to catch someone off guard so that they can beg for a free meal or a 20% discount.

I feel really bad for the poor waiters and waitresses who work here.  These people deserve medals."}
{"text":"I was here for brunch with my 11mos old and friend today. Ordered my daughter a side of blueberries and they were clearly unwashed. I asked the waitress to wash them and she responds to me- \"we don't wash our produce. We never do. We don't have have a sink upfront. Our sink is all the way in the back.\" As if this is some acceptable policy! This woman expected me to feed my baby pesticide covered fruit. I insisted and she says \"I'll check, but we're very busy\". Someone came by my table and dropped off the fruit. I'm appalled by this attitude. I can't believe I had to insist my kid's fruit be clean? 
She also got my order wrong, which I didn't even bother to send back. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast, everything look and smell fresh, Saturday and Sunday little waiting time but still not to bad.
Our server was nice and efficient to get our food together for big table."}
{"text":"What A Bagel is solid and consistent.  They bake a good variety of fresh bagels on the premises throughout the day, including pumpernickle, multigrain, whole wheat, cinnamon raisin, sesame, etc.  They also bake a variety of pastries, have a salad bar where you can customize your own salads, and make bagel sandwiches (I like the chicken curry salad), making it a busy lunch time spot.  At lunch times they also have a selection of hot foods but I have not tried them.  I can say though that the food is always fresh, the prices are reasonable (just over $5 for my bagel sandwich), and the staff, while not amazingly friendly, keep the long lunch lines moving fast."}
{"text":"This location is now CLOSED, fu future condo development :/
Really liked the bagels here and other aweasome sweet baked goods like rugaloons or something. Their tuna sandwiches were bomb too and the bread was always super fresh, so sad its gone."}
{"text":"I stopped in here between a haircut and work. I've been walking past it for years and haven't gone in until now, and I wish I had. I'll miss it when I leave the city.

Yes, the place is a bit of a dive, high-ceilinged and with the look of an industrial bakery that happens to have tables. The bagels and other goodies are on big wire racks past the cash register. Pick your bagel and take it to the deli counter staff to have it made into a sandwich. Try the cream cheese with the lox already mixed in -- it's half the price of having sliced lox on your bagel, and is still a good dose of salmon. 

These are New York style bagels -- if you're used to the chewy, dense, lembas-like Montreal bagels from Bagel House or St. Urbain, these will look positively plump and fluffy. Don't be alarmed, they're just as tasty. Follow it up with some sweet pastries (the cream horn filled with something resembling vanilla pudding is actually really lovely) and a better-than-I-expected coffee."}
{"text":"Great place for a local eatery. Service is hit or miss but the food is always good. 
Breakfast and salads tend to be very popular. 
I personally enjoy the different types of Jerusalem toasts."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday morning at 7:15am, there's no other customer in the store and It just feels awesome to not have to line up! 

The smell of freshly baked bagel is just so addicting! For my dozen of bagels, I picked almost one of each except the rainbow bagel (the most colourful bagel I've ever seen!)

All my bagels were warm and stayed warm even after coming back home. The cashier lady was the nicest lady ever, she has the warmest smile and we shared the friendliest conversation! I would definitely come back again but next time for treats rather than bagels! Thank you for the awesome experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for being open and baking fresh goods on Christmas day. I went here to get lunch, then across the street to catch a movie. This is about the only thing you can do on Christmas in Toronto. 

I had a ham and egg omelet.. Everything tasted really good. You select your food and pay for it cafeteria style, but they bring it to you at your table. Everyone was friendly, despite working on Christmas. 

The staff were coming out with trays of freshly baked cookies and desserts while I was there, I ended up picking up a bunch of treats to take to my mom's dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent and very satisfying sandwiches! Try the grilled cheese bagel with a fried egg, avocado, tomato on a bagel of your choice. It's so yummy! I just had to make it for my guests at home this morning.......they loved it! If you purchase 6 bagels you get 6 free! Freezer bags are provided. Another plus is the espresso coffee that they serve. Illy is my favourite! 
Not to mention the staff being very friendly."}
{"text":"I saw the grossest thing today --- a teenager (guy) with a cold (coughing) and then reaching in to the bagels with his HANDS and not using the TONGS provided.

I may be rethinking about shopping at these self-serve options .... you never know who touched the bagels last.  They have tons of tongs there for people to use, and yet there is always someone who needs to put their hands in the stuff ... based on today's experience, I am downgrading them to a three star."}
{"text":"OK, what's not to like about What A Bagel, but they need to work on their customer service - they are friendly and polite, but not flowing and organized.  Bagels were fresh, their bourekas is not the correct shape, its more like a turnover.  But if you're looking for bagels, the bagels here are good.  I hope they do well, they are in a good location - but they need to work on a more cohesive line AND find out how to make round bourekas with the hole in the middle ..."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the same fly that was buzzing around and sitting on their displayed baked goods or if there were more flies. I pointed this out to the proprietor who couldn't care less.

If a store is not bothered with acting on issues that customers can see and report on, I shudder to think what's going on behind the scenes.

Needless to say I didn't buy anything."}
{"text":"This 4 star rating is exclusively for their deliciously fresh and soft bagels that I pick up early mornings almost every weekend. I buy my bagels literally straight from the oven when they are warm and melt in your mouth. Add a little smear of butter and it's a great way to start the weekend.

I've become so accustomed to the consistency of their great bagels that I refuse to buy anything else from this place, lest I be disappointed. Perhaps their challah bread is not the best? Who knows? 

The proprietors are great people too: very friendly and hospitable.

Thank you What A Bagel for helping me start my weekends right."}
{"text":"I had been eagerly waiting for What a Bagel to open since I work just around the corner. It finally did! I made my way over for lunch today and at first I was excited by all the different baked goods displayed. My excitement tanked when I realized how confusing and disorganized the process of making a purchase is. 

For starters, there are no prices anywhere around the baked goods. When I asked about this, I was told to look at the TV screens. Apparently the images on the screen will change, and each image will have a price next to it. Are you serious? You want me to stand there, starting at a screen, hoping that the price for the item I am holding/interested in will appear? Ridiculous!

I noticed bags of day old baked goods, and asked for the price of the bag. They told me that it is 50% off. 50% off what? Each item in the bag? And again, there are no prices! 

Then I went to the counter to get a bagel with cream cheese. I was told that I had to choose my own bagel and then come back and they could make it into a sandwich for me. At least they did have prices for the food behind the counter. But naturally I asked if the prices already included the price of the bread, or if I had to buy the bread separately.  They said that it includes the price of the bread. So all bagels are the same price? So bloody confusing!

So I grabbed a few items (I know, I am surprised I did too after all the hassle. But I guess having invested all that time asking questions, I had to get something!) and when I tried to get them rung in, I had to tell them what each item was, and the size (they have 2 sizes for many of their items: mini and regular). I get that it is a new store, and the staff is still familiarizing themselves with the products and system. However, they were so nonchalant about the whole thing, that it seemed like it did not matter to them that the customers were ready to blow in sheer frustration. 

So how was the food?

The bagel and cream cheese is way too expensive for what you get. $3.59 for a plain bagel with plain cream cheese! Also, the bagel tasted like plain ol' bread. Not like a bagel at all. 
Anyway, I may return if I am feeling like a pastry. 

This place has a lot of kinks to work out, and one of those is the service, efficiency and recipes! 

Get the bagel recipe right!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Breakfast and after so many places we can confidently say this is the BEST place to eat breakfast in the Greater Toronto! 
The Food is absolutely delicious, top notch professional service and once again the food is SOOO GOOOD!"}
{"text":"This is what my family gets for our bagel brunch tradition after we fly in to visit relatives.

This Los Angeles native and Jewish kid LOVES what a bagel!"}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is mostly for their dine-in restaurant.

Delicious breakfast/lunch items. Everything tasted very fresh and the service is friendly and quick. I've (so far) tried the benedict, challah french toast, and omelettes here and they've all been delicious and filling. Can't go wrong with this place for a brunch. The baked goods are delicious as well and not too sweet like some others'. Gotta try their rugelach and chocolate goodies. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff and great food. 

Right when you walk in, the place feels happy. Lots of Windows, happy people and friendly staff  

During busier breakfast times, there's usually a wait but that's what you should expect for s good restaurant. 

We usually get bagelinis (flat bagels) sandwiches.  They're always fresh and hot. They do however take a long time to make for some reason. It's rare that we don't have to wait a while for them. It's ok. They're worth the wait. 

Be prepared. This is a family place. If you don't like to eat in loud environment with (potentially) screaming kids, don't come during busy times!  

Love the owners. They seem like nice people. Bakery is also good. 

The only downside. When we get bagels (sandwiches) for take out, they tend to be pretty expensive for what it is. 

Bagel power!"}
{"text":"Best bagels you can get anywhere near here and the best challah bread as well. Best to go early if you want challah bread as it always runs out. The cream cheese is also amazing."}
{"text":"I keep getting disillusioned with What A Bagel because of the prices.  A medium container of cream cheese is $13. A challah bread is $5. Yikes."}
{"text":"Crazy busy place, but worth the wait. There's not a single item on the brunch menu that I don't like. My favourites are the eggs Benedict (medium) and Pancakes (fluffy and tasty), quick coffee refills, and generous amount of fruit as side.
Plenty of parking spots in the plaza and the aroma of the fresh baked bagels is heavenly.
In summary, it's my favourite brunch spot on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Great fresh breakfast place. They are very busy even on weekday mornings but food is so fresh and reasonably priced for what you get. Service can be hit or miss. They can sometimes be rude and they look unhappy most of the time, but their food makes up for the attitude."}
{"text":"got a cold Bagel Toast... gave it back, it came back cold again... the server could care less... she was too busy to make sure that my order came out right the second time... will never go back there again. also, for a none kosher place the prices are extremely high... would recommend Yummy Market for you bread and Challa..."}
{"text":"It is not the Bagel that What A Bagel has that impressed me. Surprising it is the Salad....

Salad?? What's up? Have I been hanging around my Hot Yoga Date too much and turning into a Vegetarian??

Great selections at the salad bar with a salad going for $10.49. Sounded a little pricey...but when I saw my salad busting out from the container... I know I can just not finish that on my own. Great for Sharing!!

The sweet and pastries selection is quite good too... love those mini danish for 3 for $1. Of course the toasted bagel with cream cheese... heavenly!

No wonder there is always a long line up during lunch hours!"}
{"text":"A little bit on the expensive side of things but world's away from Tim hortons or whatever else I can think of that sells bagels. I had the seasane bagel toasted with original cream cheese and smoked salmon. The service can be a little slow at times that I have been there."}
{"text":"Why doesn't Chicago have What A Bagels?!?!?

I would love to have one of these near me downtown Chicago. 

Pa-pa-pa-PLEASE come to the Windy City. We need you!"}
{"text":"What A bagel, is a good spot to pick up something to go. Their pastries and baked goods are actually pretty good. However, they close the kitchen at 2.30pm so you really cant order a meal after 2.30. I had the Caesar Salad before which was ok, I would say the  items on the menu are overpriced. Tried their breakfast special, my scrambled eggs were overcooked, which was pretty pathetic, I mean its pretty hard to screw up scrambled eggs. I also tried the pancakes which was literally one of the works pancakes Ive ever  tasted. It was really tough and not fluffy at all. 
Overall:
Pastries and Baked Goods, really good,(cream cheese is overpriced) 
Menu items(salad etc.), not bad, but overpriced
Breakfast, more like What a Joke"}
{"text":"Love their bagels! Love their sandwiches! Love their cream cheese! Love their pastries! YUM!"}
{"text":"I just love a good bagel in the morning so when I noticed this place with that huge banner stating \"Buy 6 Bagels Get 6 Free\" I knew I had to check it out.

I came here just after 7am on a Saturday morning and the smell of fresh bread was wafting through the air. I could literally see the hot fresh bagels rolling out of the oven as I entered.

As soon as I walked through the door I was kindly greeted by the cashier who was sweet as pie and asked if I've been here before and kindly explained the whole process and what they offer. Not only do they have bagels but they also have a variety of baked goods such as croissants, bread loaves, buns, cookies, and pastries. As well they offer hot breakfast, tubs of cream cheeses, made to order bagels, custom salads, sandwiches, fries, and beverages. There was quite a bit of seating too if you wanted to dine in. However the cook doesn't start until 8am so made to order food wasn't available yet. 

I took my time deciding on my dozen bagels as they offer a variety of flavours. I settled on getting a mixture of whole wheat, multigrain, sesame seed, everything, and pumpernickel. 
 
I cashed out and the sweet cashier lady put my two hefty paper bags of bagels in a clear bagel which was nice as it kept them warm too. I was astonished to find that my dozen bagels came to a mere 4 bucks including tax. What a steal!

Just a note that these are New York style bagels so they are big and fluffy and plain tasting which is good for smearing on a bevy of toppings but if your looking for a denser more sweeter bagel such as Montreal style these are not for you.

When I got home I immediately toasted up a whole wheat bagel and the outsides got nice and crisp with a light crunchy crust but the insides stayed soft and fluffy. There is no sweetness to these bagels so it was perfect for my favourite combo of a heavy smearing of PBJ.

The service here was outstanding, the shop is spacious and very clean, and a dozen bagels for 4 bucks seems like a steal of a deal, I will definitely be back!"}
