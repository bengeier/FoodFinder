{"text":"I stopped in for a carry out order and noticed some specials on the board. I wasn't familiar with Basil Chicken. So I asked the young lady at the counter what was in it. She informed me that it was carrots, onions, chicken and sauce. (I asked because I do not like green peppers or mushrooms.) When I get home and sit down to eat I realize that Basil Chicken actually consists of mostly mushrooms and green peppers, with chicken basil and chili peppers. It didn't even contain carrots or onions. Needles to say I was unhappy that I was not served what I was told I was getting. I was quite hungry and didn't want to go back out into the cold so I tried to eat some of the chicken. 

Since it was their mistake I figured they would make it right. I called to complain. The young lady told me, that I should just pick the mushrooms and peppers out. I explained that the dish was mostly mushrooms and peppers and I asked for a refund. She informed me that since I had already eaten some of it, that they wouldn't be able to serve it to someone else! Yikes I sure hope that they don't re-sell food that customers have taken home with them!
After this exchange I offered her the option of refunding my money or permanently loosing me as a customer. She replied, \"I don't care!\" and hung up on me.
At no point during this call did she apologize for her errors in describing what I was ordering. 
We all make mistakes sometimes, but when it happens you should try to make it right.
I wont be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet with friends before seeing a movie at the Art.    Great service and good food.   For a special treat, ask for the traditional menu, which features additional dishes (for the more adventurous)."}
{"text":"The food is consistent in quality, prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly. We order at least once every two weeks, sometimes once a week"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always get dinner for 2a1 for delivery. Their spare ribs are yummy and their food always tastes good. For $20 we get fries, chow mein, 2 egg rolls and wings. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Peking Garden after reading numerous positive reviews from here and other sites.  I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options.

Since I've reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so, I decided it would be best to get the same dish (General's Chicken).  I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites.

The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering.  They do not have a website and it is not easily found online.  Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood.com.  Next, I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive (my dish was $10.90 with tax).  This isn't too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other, cheaper options in the area.

After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone, I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready.  When we arrived around 10 minutes later, our food was waiting for us at the front counter.  One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container.  This isn't a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate.   

My meal had pretty good flavor, though it wasn't as spicy as other places.  Despite the flavor, both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy.  This is probably the biggest reason for my 3-star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender.

Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon."}
{"text":"Normally order in from this place but have been a couple times as well.  Service could use some work but the food is amazing. Nobody does a better chilli chicken in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"The Good: 
-The delivery was super quick, it was only thirty minutes, and the delivery guy was very nice.
-The Bao Bao platter was super yummy, especially the pot stickers, SO GOOD. 
-Their egg rolls are very good too.
-The Little Donuts were super yummy, though standard.

The Meh:
-The price, the $25 delivery minimum was pretty high, especially for the price of the meals.
-The Sweet and Sour Chicken. The chicken itself was cooked well, though the batter had very little flavor (understandable due to the dish being sauce based). The sauce was not something I enjoy at all, but SO thought it was decent."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we absolutely loved the food! However, the service was subpar. When we walked in there was no one in the restaurant. I had to go knock on the kitchen door to get the staff's attention to finally be seated. However, the food was some of the best Asian food I've tried in Champaign. We ordered the Szechuan Shredded Pork and the Chicken lo Mein and it was delicious and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Buyers beware. I just ordered our dinner. Jumbo shrimp, chicken balls, spareribs and fried rice. Took forever to get to my place and I'm 1 mile away. All the food was so overcooked I couldn't eat it. I could hardly cut my shrimp it was so hard. The rice was so salty. 
The entire meal went in the garbage because that's where it belongs.
If you want good Chinese food, order somewhere else !!!"}
{"text":"So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.

We would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \"intestine shaped like squirrel\", anyone?

Excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment."}

Food came quick
Food good
Listened to special requests

{"text":"Love this place! 

Good portions, nice flavor, interesting menu options. I've never dined in, only carryout. 

It's the place to call when you are hungry, want good food and a short wait. No matter what I order they always say it will be ready in 10 minutes- and it is! Just walk on over and I have a bag full of delicious warm food."}
{"text":"Very tasty food from vegetarian perspective.  Loved their home style tofu and egg plant.  Atmosphere was nice. The owner was very friendly.  I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ok yes, it is a little shady. But hot damn is it my guilty pleasure. 

If you want that traditional American-Chinese food that we have all had since we were kids go here. Drinks are totally from 1950's. Love it."}
{"text":"Love this place for delivery.  We're halfway across Champaign, but delivery is always fast and the food is always hot and fresh when it gets to us.  The drivers are always courteous too.

We normally order online and request custom additions/subtractions.  It's always been on point."}
{"text":"We've been there couple of times. Food is really good, but sometimes they are ' way to hot and spicy'.

I'd definitely recommend my friends to go there!"}
{"text":"Forgot to write a review last week.  A friend treated me to dinner here.  I'd been here before in the past but seemed to have forgotten about the place.  It was clean and quiet and the service was prompt and courteous.  The egg rolls were good.  My entree was delicious and plentiful.  Again, the house tea was good.  In all, it was a pleasant experience and will be in my rotation of Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"What a let down! I had my hopes high... I like Chinese food but I had been afraid to get it anywhere in Champaign for fear of being disappointed. But after reading the menu I thought I'd give it a try as it looked authentic enough (to me...). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (Hunan chicken), but it was really disappointing: bland Chinese American, nothing tasty, nothing original. I took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash (... I can't believe I'm confessing to this!...). Kudos, though, for: the very extensive menu, the friendly waitress, and staying till 11pm (which is rare for Champaign). Maybe I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food then the spicy chicken is a must try. The cubed pieces are deep fried then saut√©ed again with garlic, green onions and red chillies. I always choose the spicy one so it comes with lots of fried chilies. It is served with a small rice bowl. I always order one which can be easily shared by two people."}
{"text":"Best chinese food around the CU. Don't even hesitate - give it a try! A friend and I got chicken lo mein and spicy garlic schezuan pork (both amazing btw!) - the bill was only $22 and it was more than enough food for 3 people."}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food for a very cheap price which is really nice as a poor college student. 

I got the mongolian beef lunch special and it was not the best but definitely good and worth the price. The fact that it comes with soup and a small appetizer is really nice and I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I've grown tired of these cookie cutter Chinese takeout places. Peking Garden is a throwback to how I remember real Chinese food. Big table with a huge lazy susan in the middle. Heaping platters of really tasty Chinese and Sichuan food that was shared around the table. The dumplings were huge and homemade. We had moo shoo pork with plum sauce, pork with garlic sauce, sesame beef, shrimp with snow peas, orange chicken and of course, General Tso's. Dinner for 6 with drinks and appetizers came to almost exactly $100. I thought it was a great value. It wasn't the newest. It wasn't the flashiest. But it was one of the best Chinese meals I've had in years."}
{"text":"Debbie, the manager of Peking Garden, is always so incredibly courteous and kind to the customers. She remembers all of their names, and greets and hugs their kids too. I go there all the time, and it's such a nice refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad and distant service. 

Not only does Peking Garden have great service, but their food is so unbelievably tasty. Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers, they are always such a hot treat. You can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations (like \"make it non-sweet\") and they never give you trouble for specific requests (unlike other restaurants in town.)

Overall, it's a really nice atmosphere with private booths, relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles."}
{"text":"I've only ordered for delivery here, but so far, my experience with this place has been excellent.  The woman who normally takes my order over the phone is usually the same person who delivers the food to me.  She is a sweetheart, and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do, she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing.  What a great memory and way to connect with your customers!

Now, for the food.  I've only ordered a couple dishes from here, but I feel no need to change my order any time soon-Mongolian beef and the General Tso's is the usual.  First of all, I love that they ask no questions about making things spicy/extra spicy.  The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy, but when I asked if they could add some spice, they enthusiastically said yes- I haven't ordered it unspicy since.  The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for.  I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel.  The General Tso's is pretty good, although not outstanding.  It's a little too sweet and saucy for my taste, but I like to have something to contrast the beef, so this is usually what I go for.

The only other dish I've ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper.  It's pretty much a party in your mouth.  Super spicy, just how I like it- the chicken is cut up small, covered in batter, and deep fried, almost like popcorn chicken, and salty, which is awesome with a plain white rice.  The only reason I don't order this all the time is because it's a little too spicy and I don't want to regret eating it the next day.

So, I can't speak for a ton of dishes, but the ones I've had thus far have been very palatable.  And the delivery service is great.  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I would like to apologize to the owners of this restaurant.  I woke up this morning to seeing an extra charge placed on my credit card from here.  After angrily calling my bank and having them reverse the charge, it was pointed out to me by a friend who I had eaten with at the time of this transaction that she (whoever rang my card) made a mistake and had said she would reverse the charge.  I did not hear this and thus the reason for my review that was brought on may my frustration.  The food here is great and contrary to what my original review stated, there are no issues with the payment process.  I hope the owners can forgive me and I look forward to going there again for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Service was great. We ordered and were given a very reasonable pick up time! Upon walking in we were handed our orders and were out of there in under a minute. It was awesome.

Ordered the Orange Chicken (basic white person here) and it is good...not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means. If you order the combination platter version of some dishes it is also cheaper! Will eat again!"}

{"text":"We love this place.  It's hard to find good, dine in Chinese restaurants so when we are in town we try to make here.   The service is good and the food is outstanding.   The menu is fairly extensive and will cover both vegetarian and the carnivore palate."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this restaurant. Foods are supper yummy specially spicy chicken and fish with bowl. We frequently go to this one. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in the Champaign Urbana area. They have both traditional and Americanized offerings. The staff is helpful and polite. The food is very high quality and has a good flavor. I had the szechuan fish and it was quite good. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago, like me and you are accustomed to \"brown\" fried rice and not \"yellow colored\" fried rice then this is the place for you.  The shrimp fried rice is delish! Reminds me of Chinatown in Chicago IL Happy times!"}
{"text":"Really good take out and delivery. Food is very well prepared, well seasoned and high quality ingredients. I've had delivery a few times and it was very fast and the food was hot and fresh. The lady who I think is the manager is quite pleasant and knows it is me when I call. I tried a couple of other places in Champaign and this place is by far the best!

Saw other reviews. The chicken fried rice is absolutely amazing - perhaps best ever."}
{"text":"I have been getting food from this place since I was a child, and when I get a chance to come to C-U I try to come as often as I can.  I love love love their fried rice, it's the best fried rice I've ever had even though most places don't seem to put a lot of time into it like Peking Garden does.  I also recommend the Mongolian beef, the dry chili chicken, and the potstickers, which are the best my husband has ever tasted which is saying something.  In short, yummy!"}
{"text":"Peking Garden is a delightful locale, and definitely one to visit as an ironic hipster in graduate school.  The decorations are garish, the food is 'authentic' in that way that Chinese food is translated for Middle America.  

I found myself @ Peking Garden celebrating a friends' completion of his prelims.  Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai, and it came in a disturbing Fu-Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features.  I was horrified and delighted simultaneously.

But not as delighted as when my friend Emily and I orderd the \"Hawaii + Love Bowl,\" a gigantic bowl of alcohol filled with cherries and anchored in the center by a small well of rum--SET ON FIRE.

Hells yes.  Because nothing says, \"I've just moved to a small Midwest college town\" like \"Let's consume the flaming jungle juice of the gods, ladies and gentlemen!\"

The food was good, although I found my shrimp fried rice as boring as it sounds.  That was my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it.  I sampled everyone else's dishes however, and they were quite tasty.  And when my uppity friend Myra bellowed that she didn't like our fortunes, they gave us brand new fortune cookies.  Except the second time--my fortune was blank.  Please Jesus, tell me that doesn't mean I'm going to die from drinking the \"Hawaii + Love Bowl.\""}
{"text":"When I used to live in the dorms, it was always really hard to get good Chinese food. Sure, there were plenty of places on Green that served Chinese but since I'm a bit spoiled by the quality of Chinese food on the West Coast, it never really satisfied me. So, the next best option was to get delivery. Nothing beats settling in with a good bowl of hot and sour soup right before finals. I really like their pepper salted shrimp, buns, braised string beans/kong xin cai, soup, and stir fried noodles. Go for their authentic dishes, some of the more Americanized ones can be sort of lacklustre (for example, General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken...) If you want to go to the physical restaurant it might be kind of hard to find since it's a little bit of a hole in the wall but it's definitely worth it. 

Pros:
-Fast delivery
-Secure delivery. I haven't had a single dish spill en-route before, unlike a lot of places!
-Super nice service
-Reasonably priced (a LOT of places on campus are really expensive considering what they're feeding you but this place is awesome.)
-Good food
-Good portions
-Good variety
-Good for groups
-Interior of the store is cozy, clean, and well done

Cons:
-Food can be oily, but to be honest those particular dishes are oily anywhere
-The Americanized dishes aren't that good in my opinion
-It might be a bit hard to communicate with the restaurant if you don't speak any Chinese but the online ordering is done via services like Eat24 and in person you can just point to what you want. Not that big of an issue.
-Sometimes food might be too salty, but if you tell them that you want less salt, they'll follow your request.
-Delivery only on $20+ so I recommend just buying with other people or buying a portion for dinner. They give you plenty of rice so you'll have more than enough for a couple meals."}
{"text":"Delicious in general. Peking duck is a meh, not as good as the one you can get from Rainbow Garden. Servings are small compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Our go-to, favorite place to have Chinese food!!  The Spicy Chicken [#43] is a must-try!!  The owners are vert nice too."}
{"text":"I've eaten there once in the past when I moved to the eastern side of the city and lets face it this place is in walking distance and looks like it's been there since 1977 so it must be good. 

the prices are pretty good
6.70 - 8$ combos before taxes (as of january 2015) 
dinners aren't too bad either. 

the area is by this dive of a bar and it's tedious to get there unless you are driving. Taco Bell, pizza pizza or anything within a small walk of there makes sense. But this place you've got to go the extra mile where it's a chore (like subway is when writing this review). When you walk in the floor needs to be steam cleaned and the place is just awkward looking. There is some space in the back but I haven't a clue what it's supposed to be for. More seating perhaps? I would renovate the place asap. The atmosphere is as dingy and dilapidated as the hotels near by. My personal favorite there was a door leaning on the wall over in the background. Hopefully it's just there temporarily but it didn't look it.'s just leaning in the hallway the employees run out of to greet the customers. 

the staff was friendly, my food came fast.. in fact too fast. I was worried. I got a #3 which was around 9$, chicken fried rice, chicken chow mein, bbq pork slices and some ribs. I was ok with the price Oriental express near regular lawrence station is fantastic and that is what I pay there but you get half as much food here at peking garden.  I was really looking forward to a new chinese food place to go to instead of the regular stuff as we need contrast. Before I start my review I've been eating chinese food for close to 25 years and I probably eat it once a week. I know good chinese food when I see it. 

The chicken fried rice - either it was greasier than mcdonalds if that is possible or soaked in soy sauce to compensate for spices. My mother never saw such brown chicken fried rice in her life. I can imagine if I got sweet and sour it would have made a difference though. But it was slimy and too moist.  There was viable amounts of chicken so it wasn't too awful. This has potential but seriously the chefs, look around see how people are doing it. More restaurants and competition out there means we don't have to settle for crappy rice. Maybe there is some people out there but ask for options. 

I don't care for chow mein I gave it to my mother which she enjoyed. To cut corners they filled half this tray with it which I wasn't too thrilled about as I despise chow mein. I could have ordered other stuff but I was in the mood for pork and bit the bullet. 

the ribs - they were dry and flavorless with maybe 2-3 bites of meat on them. Swiss challet makes better ribs and I don't care for them either.. in fact how dry they were either they were sitting there all day (went at 6pm) or they nuked them on high in a microwave which is upsetting. I don't mind waiting but that was disgraceful. I can microwave ribs from costco, food basics or nofrills and get more flavor and sauce myself.. in fact the sauce may have been good on the rice.

the BBQ pork slices - dry , flavorless. It was like I was eating with the flu. I forced myself to eat them. Again nuked in the microwave. 

all in all I probably paid 9$ for a tv dinner to be made by strangers for me and some really half \"arsed\" rice and a sickly amount of chow mein. I'm sticking with lucky or golden chopsticks which are other local places."}
{"text":"Definitely at least 4.5 stars, but I will be generous and give five today. I tried the Mandarin beef, Mongolian Beef and potstickers. The food and portions were great: I had a bunch of leftovers almost enough for another meal. I enjoyed the fried noodles that came with the Mandarin beef although the Mongolian beef was a little too chewy. It was not bad by any means, but I have tried better Mongolian beef dishes. 

I think the service is a five stars although I only had a limited experience with it on my pick-up order. The staff took my phone order accurately and quickly, understanding all of the items I requested, which was a pleasant surprise. I was given an ETA of my food being ready for pickup within 10 minutes after ordering. I found my order already done when I went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call. The cashier was also friendly and remembered what I ordered right away. There were a couple other orders ready when I went. 

Two small complaints I have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies. I ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy ingredients in the soy sauce packets. (see my picture below) Also, the fortune cookies were a bit stale, you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture. Anyways, this didn't bother me too much because I don't usually eat fortune cookies anyways and I had my own soy sauce at home. 

Overall a 4.5 if not 5 stars for the great food and service, and almost one off for the two small complaints above."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, got the spicy garlic scallops since I was feeling ambitious and this place had good reviews. Unfortunately, the sauce wasn't spicy and the scallops were overcooked and thus rubbery. Reasonable delivery time"}
{"text":"got the general tsos chicken which is just a glorified orange chicken....they give huge portions but only little rice, it was ok, nothing to brag about...won't be back"}
{"text":"Peking Garden is a wonderful place, excellent for its variety of interesting dishes and pleasant atmosphere. I throughly enjoyed my chile chicken, fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery hot sauce, which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant. The meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges. The service was great and the prices weren't bad either. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food in a town where there is a LOT of competition.

The Orange beef and Chili Chicken are both excellent dishes.

Definitely need to be cleaned though, the restaurant is dirty."}
{"text":"The man running the restaurant hit a 7 or 8 year old child working the restaurant multiple times behind the wall where I was sitting. The child screamed. The man yelled back and then hit him again. No one should go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The fried rice is on point, the best in town. I have tried other menu items, some are a let down. Such as the Beef on a Stick. It lacks flavor and is too chewy. The generals chicken can be soggy and not crisp like it should. The fried rice, always delicious. The owners are friendly. I usually get take out. They are full to the brim. You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the personal service and attention to detail. Food was delicious - I had ribs with ginger and scallions. They also had bbq ribs, but this appealed to me more.

It was a wonderful dining experience for my family."}
{"text":"Our favourite place for chinese food!  It's a little expensive but the food is high quality so it's a nice treat when we order from Peking Garden (and they've been in business since the 70s!)"}
{"text":"My first experience with Peking Garden was two years ago when I first arrived in Chambana for freshman orientation @UIUC. I had found a delivery menu in the hotel. I was sorely disappointed with the quality and taste of the food, as well as the price.

As it turns out, the delivery menu is the Americanized menu, which probably isn't what you're looking for, unless your favorite Chinese food consists of some chicken dish possibly invented by some sort of military guy.

At the restaurant, make sure you get the Chinese menu (blue cover). The menu has English, Chinese, as well as Korean text.

My family ordered the shredded pork with hot garlic sauce, stir fry beef with ziran, and the all inclusive hot pot. The all inclusive hot pot had fried tofu, bamboo, rice noodles, snap peas, Chinese sausage, mushrooms, and steamed meatballs. Bowls of rice are free and all you can eat! These are large portions, meant to be shared with at least one other person, unless you are very hungry!

My favorite dish was the hot pot. The mushrooms were meaty and the soup was sublime.  The pork and beef were both very tasty, great over some rice. No food was left behind. :)

The owners are quite kind, although their children can be found running around the restaurant playing. This was a bit noisy, but I'm quite used to noise. Some customers are noisier, however.

Overall, the food was great and the price was reasonable. Would definitely return here for another meal!"}
{"text":"This place offers solid authentic Chinese food. The register was packed when I arrived and the manager quickly noticed us hiding behind the swarm of people and we were quickly seated with apologies for the wait and noise. It is a slightly nicer place to have Chinese food in Chambana as the decor extends away from the fast food theme of their take-out menu.  My family and I received the 'authentic' blue menu upon arriving (I'm assuming because we are Chinese) but if you don't receive it automatically I highly suggest you directly ask for it.  

The all inclusive hot pot was one of the best things I had there and can easily be a full meal for a single person as it includes clear rice noodles for some filling carbs.  The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand.  This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places.  For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef.  

The ambiance is great for large groups as most tables are large and plates are obviously meant for sharing. She does have small kids running around the area but I feel it adds to the homey feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a very nice family-run Chinese restaurant in downtown Champaign, especially convenient for lunch specials that are well-priced. You will usually be waited on by the proprietress, who is one of the nicest and sweetest people in Champaign-Urbana :) The food is pretty good, although perhaps adjusted for American tastes. It reminds me of the many neighborhood Chinese places all up and down Manhattan. I've had a lot of good lunches there - I can recommend the chicken dishes and the shrimp kung pao. Also good won ton soup."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there for lunch.  They're friendly and serve good food.  The lunch menu is also very affordable.  

My only criticism would be a way to order lunch online without the extra soup and egg roll.  It's just a lot of extra food I don't need. 

I've eaten there at night as well, but it's been a while.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I love that the owner always remembers us and give us the Chinese menu. I love the Korean options. I love the mixed alcoholic beverages, which we have only tried once but left a big impression (ha ha).

If you are normally inclined to stick with the \"American\" menu, please do reconsider at least once! Many of the alternative/more authentic items are explained well in the menu and if you have any questions, servers are more than happy to help.

It isn't the most peaceful environment, and sometimes children are playing in the back room. However, if you can get past this, your experience should be five-star for sure!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food and friendly wait staff. The owner is so nice and always remembers me and my boyfriend when we come in and greets us personally. We don't even go there that often! The Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce is AMAZING and the Scorpion Bowl drink is delicious and hilarious. Comes in a Hawaiian themed bowl with a shot in the center that is on fire! Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"The Spring roll was definitely the best part of my order. The sweet and sour chicken was dry, and shriveled up within two hours - most chinese food is great as leftovers but nothing I ordered was able to be saved as leftovers. The sweet and sour sauce was decent. Definitely biggest problem was the dry meat. Not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"i order this place all the time, GREAT
           -----But----
One day i went in to the actually location and it was gross looking and the staff was horrible. Just Bad Bad Bad... wouldnt order again."}
{"text":"When my brother- and sister-in-law (who is Taiwanese) visited recently, we made the very great decision to let her order for all of us off of the secret menu.  If you visit Peking Garden's website, they call it the \"Exotic Menu.\"  Nothing that I'd gotten off the menu for whitey had been bad, mind you, but the real deal stuff was awesome.  In addition to Sizzling Rice Soup, Deep-Fried Shrimp (whole), and Twice-Cooked Pork, we were treated to Stir-Fried Lamb with Ziran and Bean Leaves in Garlic Sauce.  The Ziran sauce was sweet, maybe reminiscent of cinnamon, and unlike anything I'd tasted in Chinese cuisine before.  The Bean Leaves were vibrantly green, tender--not soggy, and studded with garlic cloves.  AMAZING.

I still have not had their giant alcoholic drinks, but I want to.  I just want to have a cocktail big enough for two people while munching on bean leaves and garlic cloves.  Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"I order from this place and my family does as well. The price is super cheap. Dinner for 2 for $23, pretty decent. However, I cant figure this out. When I order from this place my sweet and sour Pork is overcooked. When my family orders from this place their sweet and sour pork is soooo good, not overcooked. I cant understand. Its a mystery to me. I love the flavour of the food and I will order again."}
{"text":"I realize that the standards for Chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low.  However, the fact this joint has such a high yelp rating leaves me distressed over the taste buds of my fellow yelpers.

Fried rice- fairly standard, right?  I've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice.  There was nothing in it.  No bits of egg, no meat, no shreds of carrot, no scallion, no onion, no peas.  Nothing.  A scoop full of sticky brown-ish rice.  It smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor.  Just rice doused with soy sauce.  Effing gross.

The chicken did not taste like General Tso.  It was like they added a tad of soy sauce to the sweet n' sour.  It was not spicy.  It was not flavorful.  And the meat itself?  Dry, tough, stringy, chewy.

The rangoon were filled with cream cheese, but they didn't seem to have any crab.

This place blows."}
{"text":"I ordered BBQ pork slices and it came very dry and had a dark gray color, as if it was sitting out for the entire day. I called to tell the restaurant and the guy said he doesn't make his pork juicy, that's at other Chinese restaurants. Also, that his policy says there are refunds or switching the item. Please do not order from here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I work downtown so this is my goto Asian lunch spot. The prices are very inexpensive, food comes out quickly and most importantly it is delicious. Also, the owners and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The service and food were great. They offer an extensive menu of Americanized and traditional Chinese dishes. I liked the beef tripe and vegetable dishes. I'd recommend coming with a group - there's definitely enough seating for everyone."}
{"text":"I have had delivery from Peking Garden a few times.  The delivery times have been good, but for the price I find the food to just be OK.  The General Tso's chicken has been pretty bland, even when ordered at the \"Hot\" setting, and just tastes like deep-fried chicken in some sauce.  It is life sustaining, but not much beyond that.

The portions are HUGE...be advised!"}
{"text":"This is some pretty bomb Chinese food. The combination plate is a must as it comes with egg rolls and portions are very generous. I usually get this for delivery or take out and I've never had a long wait. Their service is always friendly too. I love that you can customize the spiciness of your dish. Because \"spicy\" in the Midwest is not spicy!  I've had dishes ordered \"extra spicy\" at other Chinese restaurants that come out anything but spicy. That's never the case at Peking Garden!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant and owners. I live out of town most of the year and look forward to coming back here every time. Potstickers-get them. Open let-made of awesome."}
{"text":"I have had Chinese food in many places - Peking Garden is certainly one of the very best of them.

I love spicy food. That's why the spicy chicken from their special menu is my all time favorite. If you are into spicy food, you'll love it!

To balance the heat of the spicy chicken, you can have the gan-shao shrimp. It's a sweet and sour dish and will certainly complement the fiery-hot spicy chicken.

Other recommendations include mongolian beef, eggplant in garlic sauce, and fish-in-a-plate with spicy sauce.

In ethnic restaurants I try to avoid dishes commonly found in fast food restaurants (orange chicken, general tso's chicken in a chinese restaurant for example). So, if you want to try something different Peking Garden is a great place - the owner, although not very fluent in English, tries her best to accommodate your needs."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. I got the food within 40 min. Orange chicken was very greasy and it had a kinda weird sweet orange flavor. Pot stickers were large and fried rice were a little bit dry."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My boyfriend and I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, the general tso chicken, shrimp lo mein, and egg rolls. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the shrimp lo mein. Wayyyyyy to fishy and the noodles weren't the best. Other than that, the rest of the order was really good."}
{"text":"I loved our meal here. We had spicy fish with Szechuan sauce and garlic eggplants. The meal was perfect and tasted great."}
{"text":"For years I lived a block from this little unsuspecting restaurant, and I always passed it by because I thought it was just another greasy counter serving your average Chinese fare.  If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes (General Tso's chicken, lo mien, fried rice, etc.), tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional, true-blue Chinese dishes (squid, sea cucumber, etc.).  Unfortunately, I can't vouch for the Americanized food items as I've never tasted them.  

However, there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book: Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (to my knowledge) where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot (sometimes called shabu-shabu in Japanese restaurants).  If you've never eaten hot pot before, let me explain the general idea: a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table.  You will also be given plates of raw vegetables, meat, and noodles.  You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot, wait a few minutes, and then start serving the soup from your table.  Definitely a treat during winter months, and worth a try for adventurous diners!    

I haven't tried too many other dishes here, but I did order dumplings once, and have been requesting them on visits ever since.  Usually most Asian restaurants (even the Chinese ones) sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings.  The outside dough is paper-thin, indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in-store.  At Peking Garden, the dumpling dough is thick and chewy, the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be!  The meat filling is still a little plain (just ground pork and a few carrots, nothing special), but the dough wrappers are FO' REAL!

The interior decor is that faded '80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area.  You can't really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn't bother to fix some broken bulbs.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous, but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups.

Everybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger, Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty, the hot pot.  If you're not sure what to do when you get there, stare at the tables of Chinese diners, follow their lead, and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have a high standard for Chinese food, so most places don't get the coveted 5 star rating.  Peking Garden was a weird case for me though.

This place is EXTREMELY hit or miss, more so then I ever seen a restaurant be... The first time I went here with coworkers, the food was hot, came quick, and tasted terrific. At the time, I would have ALMOST gave it a 5 star rating. I was glad I didn't though. I went back a second time and the food came out cold, there was a long wait, and it didn't taste nearly as good. I went back a third time, and this time the food was just average tasting.  My entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird.. The service was also bad this trip. 

The 4th time I went back though was what ultimately makes the place deserve the 2 star rating, as not only was the service terrible, but our food took almost 45 minutes to come out and there were only three tables filled in the restaurant.
 
The worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it... It was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day.  We are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup.  It had large chunks of either oil or raw egg in it, and we were sick for nearly two weeks with stomach cramps.  

Somewhat trivial but the day was only made worse as the waitress made pricing errors on my bill, of which I had to argue with her that egg rolls came with the lunch special and were not supposed to be an extra charge... 

At this point, other then the first time I went there, the food has been pretty sub-par, and food comes out cold way too often... Service can also go from great to absolutely terrible depending on who is working that day. I wanted to really like this place since it is close to my work, and the food is priced right ($6-7 for a big plate), but unfortunately, bad service, long wait times, and food that frequently goes from tasting good to absolutely terribly has me moving on. Eater's beware, maybe you'll get a good meal, but you may get a terrible one too...."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate 0 stars. I called and placed an order for delivery that was a struggle to get through because she didn't speak or understand English. Then after an hour of waiting, I called back to see where my order was and another person answers and says that she thought I canceled my order. I said why would she think that, I gave my card info and everything and she said 30 mins. So then I ask when my order will now be delivered and she says that she thinks they don't deliver here. I say ok, but you just delivered here 2 weeks ago so she says well, that was 2 weeks ago-BEYOND astonished at how rude that was!! I told her they really need to get their act together and that that was terrible customer service and hung up. RUDE!"}
{"text":"Got take out on a Monday night.

I used the online ordering which was convenient and easy.

We got a Chicken Lo Mein combo and an Empress chicken.

The Chicken lo mein was good. Flavorful noodles and a nice mix of what appeared to be good quality chicken and fresh veggies. Portion size including the rice was huge. Definitely enough for two big meals. The egg rolls that game with it were average.

My Empress chicken was alright. It was lightly breaded chicken chunks with a mix of fresh broccoli, bamboo shoots, mushrooms and bok choy. It was good but the sauce that it was in didn't really impress me. It tasted like every other sweet and sour sauce. The chicken also seemed to be a little soft and mushy. I'm not sure why this would be, but I feel like it should have had at least a little firm texture?

Our meal cost $21. Between two people, we were able to make two meals each out of our food, so I suppose the portion size/price is justified. I unfortunately was just not very impressed with my Empress chicken.

3/5"}
{"text":"Average fast food Chinese served by friendly people. I have always taken out here, and never ordered anything off the non-Americanized menu. It wouldn't surprise me if they have better items that I have yet to try, but what I have had so far has been very reasonably priced, well-portioned, and exactly what one would expect. Nothing wrong with three stars.

If you are getting it for lunch at work like I often do, be sure to order off the lunch specials menu or you will overpay. Also make sure to set an alarm clock for 4:55pm to rouse you out of your food coma in time to go home."}
{"text":"I've ordered fro here a few times in the past. They have done-in and take-out options. The food always seems to be done rather quickly. It is also very affordable price wise. Usually has a lot of take-out customers. The washrooms and the hall towards the back of the restaurant seem rather sketchy. It has a lot of drug addicts in the plaza where it is located and a pub too. You can get a lot to eat for under 10$( combo deal). For two dinners I could definitely pay under 20."}
{"text":"Love the food here! I love trying new things and I live nearby. So far every choice has been a great success! 

Try their eggplant (yes, eggplant) dish. You will be surprised by how flavorful a vegetable dish can be. In fact, all of their vegetarian choices were beyond my expectation, even though I usually identify myself as a carnivore.  

The spicy fish and double-cooked port, and lamb with cumin (they call it differently, but it tasted like cumin) are my go-to."}
{"text":"I have been a regular of this place since 2007. My favorite dishes are \"Stir fried pig's intestine in spicy sauce\", \"Spicy mapo tofu with pork\", and \"tang-soo-yook\".  I almost always get the same menu all the time, so I can't say much about the other items. But man, these people can cook!"}
{"text":"Peking Gaaden is sooo good.  I always get the chicken fried rice with chicken balls and sweet and sour sauce.  Yummy!! Now, I like chicken balls, and this is the best place I believe to get them from.  Lots of meat and the sweet and sour sauce to compliment! My husband likes the golden fingers but I think they are a bit oily. But oh well, what chinese food isn't! Thats why we all love it!  Combos are great and well set up. And it was really fast.  The restaurant is meh.  Nothing special at all.  Wouldn't recommend it as a date, or to sit in but def a pick up and movie night at home :)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but as far as I know, it's good stuff! I ordered chicken and broccoli and the portions were HUGE. Not to mention the dishes were served separately in three really cute bowls/plates complete with crispy won tons and soup. The service was also really awesome, fast, and it was cute because it was a mother and her two (really adorable) kids. The only thing was that it was a bit empty in there, perhaps because of the odd location. I definitely will be back to hopefully give this place it's fifth star!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for good Chinese food that delivers in Chambana, and this place wins! Great soups and love the steamed dumplings. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Alright food. Pretty average in taste, quality, and prices. A bit inconsistent with their cooking."}
