{"text":"I have gone the twice and each the food was great for the price. I would recommend this to anyone e who wants quick and easy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Late afternoon, on Father's day
Riva's is not busy, one other patron infront of us, and one arrived after us. 

We've been here before, the food is tasty, but not spectacular.
The salsa bar is a plus, but you have to search or ask for it, as it is closed to prevent spoilage, or flies.  There is no A/C, so don't plan on eating here, either drive through, or carry out in the summer.... 

And BEWARE, although tasty, foods are not freshly made.  There is a microwave they use to heat food.  One of  my four Styrofoam containers was microwaved to the point of melting inside."}
{"text":"Tortillas are AWESOME. Bean and cheese burrito is one of the best I've had from these types of places. Nachos were freakin delicious. Open late. Drive thru. 

I'll take it."}
{"text":"Nasty food , the meat was old and cold and the veggies were even colder the employee was lazy and instead of making it fresh he decided to serve food that was sitting there for a while"}
{"text":"Ordered nachos, carne asada cold! when I returned it he said its because the cheese and guacamole are cold that's why the meat was cold- no apology!! He then asked if I wanted my money back or something else, I ordered the fish tacos and all he gave me was two fish tacos no rice and beans which costs less then what I originally ordered-- so that means I left Unsatisfied and ripped off!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here last night. Noticed they just raised their prices. I woke up at 5 am throwing up like crazy for hours. Will never eat here again. Also staff is not very friendly and were arguing with another customer while I was waiting for my food. Food poisoning sucks, and so does this place."}
{"text":"super divey, even lower than filbertos.... good for college kids that need late night munchies but my husband got sick off the fish tacos... i guess when you are desperate and its the closest thing to you besides burger king it ok..."}
{"text":"I dont like to give bad ratings to businesses but this place is deserves a terrible rating! I have been here a 3 times, and everytime they have messed up on my order. Just Recently I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and I was throughly dissapointed in the service I recieved. The lady I dealt with was extremely rude. I would not recommend this place to anyone. This place delivers terrible customer service and below average mexican food. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food, average to overpriced depending on what you get. Their customer service is subpar... but then again you don't go to a taco joint for their customer service."}
{"text":"Oh man, best place to get late night food ever!!  So many choices, and unlike most other cheapo mexican food places, this one does not make me sick after i eat there!  I absolutely LOVE the chimichangas and the california burrito with potatoes in it.  The enchiladas are awesome too, and you can see them prepare your food!  THe staff has always been friendly and the place is super clean, it does take a while to go through the drive through though. Also you get a ridiculous amount of food for your buck.  THe most i spend there is maybe $8 and i have at least two meals from it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there the first week they opened. I got a green burrito, thinking it would be filled with meat and green sauce. No, it was FILLED with rice and 3 small pieces of meat.  Not happy at all, I guess cutting corners is what they do.  My wife got a bean and cheese burrito, which she said the beans were very good.  We'll try it one more time, if the meat burritos are all filled with rice, I'll be going back to Filibertos where you get what you pay for!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back if it were the only Mexican food restaurant within 20 miles."}
{"text":"Let me say first, I've been going here for years, they have great food and I've always tipped. I'm never going there again because they've started trying to rip me off the last 2 times I've gone there. I got 3 bean & cheese burritos, I wanted rice so he runs my card and I was like, wait what was the total? He said he charged me $3 for extra rice, to put a spoonful in each burrito. The menu says $2 for a 1/2 pint! He said don't order it with rice next time! I just went there again and he charged me $2 extra for the cheese that has always come with the bean & cheese burrito! He said he'd take $1 off, I told him to give me all of my money back, I drove down the street and realized he'd shorted me, for principle I went back and demanded it all, man I haven't been that livid in a long time. Watch these guys, they're trying to rip people off!"}
{"text":"For AZ this place is ok.  I'm used to San Diego Mexican food where the meat is so tender and juicy... ( yum)

This place doesn't come close, but for what Surprise has to offer it is not bad.

I fed the family for under $50 so prices are reasonable.  

Carne asada is not as tender and flavorful as expected.  The meat was lacking flavor and the rice was bland.  

They do make rolled tacos w/ cheese and guacamole very well.  We got the 12 rolled tacos for about $8... Not bad

If you want affordable Mexican food at a good price this place is good.  Beats spending an arm and a leg at a place like Macayos where I think food sucks.  Only thing you will miss is the alcohol ;). Not a bad spot.  Customer service was great so that's always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened in Surprise! I am a fan! My favorite is the shredded beef taco and California burrito. The guacamole is pretty good too. You get tons of food and it won't burn a hole in your pocket."}
{"text":"I may have eaten here 50 times and can say that i have ever gotten a bad burrito. The grilled chicken or ham breakfast burrito are fantastic and worth getting at any time of the day - which they are open for you. Not a pretty place - but pretty enough to get you some fantastic burritos - 5 stars no question.

Update: Oh no - they changed their grilled chicken burro - NOOOOO.  4 starts until they bring the old direction back!

Update: The have remodeled - and brought the old grilled chicken back!"}
{"text":"We went to Rivas at 9:00pm the day before Thanksgiving. The place was clean and well organized. Some of the cool things are 2 TV's that had the Suns game on and the place was empty besides one couple. We had grilled chicken tacos, cheese quesadillas (delicious), machaca and egg burrito, chicken rolled tacos, and regular chicken taco. Honestly, the food was just average. The quesadilla was the best part and I would give that one item 4 stars. We didn't eat in the restaurant and they had our food ready in about 10 minutes which in my book was pretty quick. They had a large variety of menu items and serve the breakfast items until midnight! 

If you are hankering for a quick decent Mexican meal this is your place. Still doesn't come close to Carolina's but I give it 2.5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Would have given a 5 but I've tried to come by in the morning @ 6 and no one is ever here."}
{"text":"Just left Rivas for the second straight day....both times I ordered the steak ranchero breakfast burrito...AMAZING!!  a can't miss place!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and my dad said I should go here. We are pretty Mexican and know what good traditional Mexican food should taste like and this was excellent. I had the Fish taco plate, which was crispy fish, excellent sauce and fresh lettuce and pico (so good, I inhaled!). The BF had Rolled Taco Supreme, which had high quality carne asada, rolled beef tacos, guac & cheese. We also had Tamarindo and chips. The salsa bar was soo good and very authentic. I felt like I was back at my Nana's kitchen. This place is like a block away from where we live and we will definitely be going back. PS we were sober and it was like 6ish at night. I'm never eating at the Taco Bell down the street again!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday afternoon and got a Surf and Turf burro and a side Chile Rellano. Service was fine, decent burro. I dinged a star as the chile seemed old (not fresh at all) and the breading was lacking, won't order it again. I'll go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"Don't ask for an item with no cheese, because they won't listen. The cooks always add it, even though I've always asked them not too. When I ask, the man who takes the order says \" we never put cheese on this burrito\" and then I check and BAM, its there. Foods good when order is right, but just beware when you have special orders."}
{"text":"this place is such a rip off. $7 dollars for a half supreme nacho when the full is $8. The prices when I get a bean and rice burrito are ALWAYS different. The women working the drive thru are rude and unfriendly most of the time. I like to shop at smaller businesses but this place just isnt worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Just had the rolled taco supreme... OMG... This is THA BUSINESS! They could be fried a little softer, but other than that... This is perfect \"I work the night shift, and I'm starving and it's my turn to do the food run\" food."}
{"text":"I usually like Rivas and have ate there frequently but today KILLED it for me!!! I buy 4 entertainment books a year because my family and I LOVE to eat out, so being extremely hungry my sister and I went there today to order some food and went to use our Internet coupon from Rivas that we had JUST PRINTED!!! Some rude ignorant lady tells me that it's a fake coupon and she won't take it. I tell her we have used them before and there is a validation code on it and if she thought it was a fake call the number and validate it. She basically called me a liar and refused to do it.... THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS FOR GOOD!!! Juanita you need a better attitude and you could use a lesson in English as well!... My husband is hispanic and I am no where near a racist but if your going to conduct business you need to be able to properly understand and listen to your customers!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service is horrible. We called ahead and asked if they do phone orders, I was told they do. Placed my order over the phone and was told it will be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. Waited 20 minutes and headed to pick it up. When I got there I said I was there to pick up my order, she repeated some of my order (as if she were making sure it was correct). I waited another 15 minutes because my order wasn't ready. When she was packing my food to go she said \"you wanted ground beef for the chimi, right?\" I said yes. She takes out one box and hands it back to the guys and says to remake it. I wait another 5 minutes. When she came around with my food, I asked why my food wasn't ready since I called it in, her response was they wait on phone orders until the customer gets there because they have received a lot of prank calls!! REALLY!? Why wasn't that told to me on the phone? Completely irritating and horrible service! We will never go back. When the food quality is decent, not great, there is no room for error in service."}
{"text":"This used to be an all time family favorite. Unfortunately, the past three time that we have ordered from there, the food has been very unsatisfactory! As a matter of fact, just last night I ordered from there and ended up throwing the food away after one bite; it was absolutely disgusting! I had my daughter and husband try the food as well just to make sure that it wasn't me. Nope, all three of us agreed that it was disgusting and that was officially our last try."}
{"text":"Their food is really good. We usually always get the same, the supreme nachos, the supreme rolled tacos and carne asada burrito and it never disappoints always delicious food"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito ever... Don't let the outside fool you... I had the Machaca and egg burrito..big, hot and delicious. It even has a drive through! I will be a regular!

The green hot sauce compliments the Machaca well."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rivas numerous times, my favs are the carne asada tacos, bean and cheese burrrito, breakfast burrito, steak omelette, and the taco salad with carne asada. Love their green sauce, as well.                                                                                                                                        Today was disappointing, I don't know if it was a new cook, but the meat on both of our taco salads was missing. I used the drive thru, so I didn't know until I got home, and who wants to drive back when it's 105 outside. Ugh!! I did give them a call to let them know, and she asked if I was coming back, and I told her no, I just wanted them to know. Hopefully, whom ever ordered a taco salad today, got their meat! lol"}
{"text":"The girl who works the front had less personality than gum on my site and she was as helpful as wet toilet paper. I was going to order the veggie burrito. It had beans on it. The beans are the bulk and base of burrito. They are not vegetarian. My wife's tacos were nasty too. Tacoi bell would be better"}
{"text":"Rivas is a staple for 24 hour mexican in Tempe. I would consider them a step above Filibertos but one step below Los Favoritos. I usually opt for a carne asade burrito, and the only reason I didn't give them five stars is that their burritos are not always consistent. The restaurant itself is clean and they have a nice salsa bar. Not much else to say except try them out!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today. I had huevos rancheros and my husband ate rolled tacos. He enjoyed the generous amount of guacamole in the tacos. My huevos was on pico de gallo and corn tortillas. The beans and rice were also very tasty. The red and green sauces were good and had a bite. Lat but not least, the bathroom was very clean."}
{"text":"Good food but the drive thru service needs working on , the girl who has been there before when I've eaten here still has the same crappy  attitude, that's why most of my business goes to filibertos or Humberto's . They should be appreciative of any business they get in the hole in the wall spot they are in and the arrogant crappy attitude  definitely doesn't help"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it was one of the few places to grab a bite at midnight. Large menu, tried the carne asada tacos and nachos supreme. The beans were salty, rice was bland as was the carne asada. Red and green sauces were both very mild."}
{"text":"Best mexican fast food in the Surprise area hands down!

Blows everyone out of the water, everything is good.

Thank you"}
{"text":"We really like their food. Their breakfast burritos are amazing and I love their bean burritos. Yummy! Thank you Rivas."}
{"text":"Had dinner here one weekend and had the Combo with a couple of rolled tacos, taco and toastada... crazy awesome Tacos, but the rolled tacos weren't the greatest. I loved the salsa with tons of cilantro! I need to try the menudo sometime soon!! 

Nice, COOL, clean taquieria with a nice seating area. No cheap o booths! lovez it. and it's open 24 hours!! So if you're in the hood and its late... waaaay late... forget the bell and head to Rivas!!"}
{"text":"When your looking for that step up from Filibertos or Federicos this is where you go. Prices are competitive,  but the food is far better at Rivas. Looking to try something new. Go for the Surf and Turf Burrito.  Awesome."}
{"text":"The chorizo burrito at Rivas is one of the best I've had. The tortilla is grilled, which adds great texture and compliments the wonderfully flavored chorizo."}
{"text":"We go here all the time! There chips and gauc, breakfast chili rellenos burrito it's pretty good food and if you like meat I've been told there steak burrito is bomb"}
{"text":"used grubhub to order food from Rivas, ordered about $75 worth of food and when I picked it up and took it back, realized half of my food was missing... tried to call the Rivas location multiple times and didnt get any answer went back to the shop and told them about their mistake and the lady working the register literally tried to blame it on me and wasn't even apolgetic the least bit.... what kind of business is this? really disappointed and will not be returning"}
{"text":"If you're ever craving food poisoning this is the spot to go! Good luck! Customer service 0* they acted pissed off that I was there. Don't worry, myself and other family members won't return!"}
{"text":"They are the rudest workers. Always pissy with customers.Food isn't as good nor can they get an order straight.  Oh and if you go at night, beware they try to add money to your order hoping your too drunk to notice.  Ordered a $5 burrito tried to charge me $15, thinking i would be too drunk to catch. Sorry, not drunk."}
{"text":"I love Riva's and I have yet to be disappointed! I always order the rolled tacos supreme *DROOOLS* and I would devour that stuff in like 0.67 seconds. Hahah jk, I actually can never finish all 4.. or is it 5 rolled tacos? Ehhh  anywho you get the idea. It is mmmmm delicious. Rivas over Filibertos-- allllll day babyyyyyy :D"}
{"text":"FOR Emily B. WHEN you don't like your burrito you go talk to the person who made it for you not whine and hurt peoples business. that pic u posted looks like something you cooked up at home in your frying pan. Dont blame others for your malfeasance. Wendy K was just pointing out the truth and trying to save awesome local businesses from weasels and whiners like you who hide behind the computer screen to disparage a hard working restaurant."}
{"text":"So we finally tried Rivas a couple of weeks ago after driving past it so many times. It is just not that good. The cashier girl was more interested in chatting with the person in the kitchen and her coworker than doing her actual job-- but no big deal, you come to expect it from most of the younger generation. The food was below average. I ordered one of the combo plates-- which looked nothing like the menu-- and it was virtually tasteless. I mean tasteless to the point that even hot sauce couldn't save it. Probably will not return to see if the food/cashier get any better."}
{"text":"The carne asade here is cooked right, carne asada should not be the consistency of beef jerky and they know that here.  They also have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, Filiberto's style.  The breakfast menu is very good.  It's a shame they caused the closing of Zef's, a nearby competitor, the two contrasted each other nicely.  I've not been impressed with their chicken but the carne asada is very good.  Try the land and sea quesadilla, my favorite.

Would be nice if they'd spend $50 and develop a website with their menu etc on it."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times.   The only reason I am taking off a star is because they have messed up the order a few times, but we had gone thru the drive thru... And that thing can be hard to hear thru on the customer side so I'm not positive that they didn't repeat the orders wrong and I agreed to the wrong order.   Anyways, surf and turf burrito is my go to.  As well as carne asada fries for my daughter.   Their rolled tacos supreme are very good as well.   Husband always gets carne asada burrito combo and loves it."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food.  The girl behind the counter is kinda unfriendly.  She got annoyed with me because I didn't understand her menu.  There are a lot of options!  The burritos are good and so are the enchiladas.  They have excellent red sauce. It's clean inside and seems well managed.  They don't go out of their way for the customers, but the food is good and cheap.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like \"health code violations\" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit."}
{"text":"I've been on a mexican food kick lately. And after eating at Rivas my mexican craving has been satisfied. I had the california burrito (deep fried), the rolled tacos, and the supreme nachos. [I'm fat] They were ALL fantastic! And they have a drive-thru for when I don't want to change out of my pajamas! :)"}
{"text":"First time here through the drive thru. Flattened boxes strewn everywhere. I thought I was transported to a Mexican back alley with the hot wet garbage smell spewing out of the trash bins after a rain storm. The cashier was not very friendly taking my order. It was like I was intruding and pulled her away from something else more important that she was doing. I got the food I ordered and gave it to the wife when I got home. Lost my appetite from the smell. The wife said the food was phenomenal..."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Unfortunately, I'm rating this place with only 3 stars because of the terrible customer service provided by just one of their drive thru employees. This person's sour attitude and lack of customer service is a large blemish on this otherwise fantastic establishment."}
{"text":"Most of the reviewers must have been high or drunk when they gave this place such high praise.  Went here with a friend for lunch today.  First off, there was no ac.  No ac in the middle of the summer?  Hopefully it was just broken.  The food was very subpar compared to any bertos out there.  My friend got a regular beef enchilada and it was stuffed with onions and green peppers.  Wtf?  I ordered the California burrito and it was very bland and not very tasty.  I had to dump salsa on every bite to liven it up a bit.  Finally when we left, my friend had filled up her drink and accidentally left it near the soda dispenser.  She walked me to my car and remembered, so she went back in.  They had already thrown it away and refused to give her another cup.  I will never come back to this dump again.  If you're looking for an amazing taco shop at 3:30 in the morning, head to Taco Migo near the intersection of I-10 and baseline.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service there."}
{"text":"Between the bland chicken, horrible tasting condiments, and the FAKE machaca. This has been by far the WORST \"Mexican\" restaurant. I don't understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business!?! Machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled. Good thing I don't live around here, I had found this on Yelp from a Dr. visit."}
{"text":"Rolled Taco special was a bit disappointing. The tacos were not crunchy and were soft in the middle, leading to the ultimate rolled taco  soggy mess. It was 4 bucks for rolled tacos without carne asada, but 7 bucks with the meat and thats the only thing that is special about the special order. The Carne asada was average at best, too chewy and not all the fat trimmed away. Guacamole overwhelmed the five skinny tacos and cheese was not melted great. Horchata needed more taste, as the classic flavors of vanilla and cinnamom were tough to detect. PLace might be good for drunken students, but the experienced Mexican drive through tongue knows the truth."}
{"text":"I was hella skeptical that a Phoenix fast food Mexican joint could top a Mission taqueria.  Rivas pleasantly surprised me.  I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7."}
{"text":"I've never had issues with the service here, I normally go through the drive thru and the girls there are very friendly. My food is always correct and tastes delicious, not to mention they're reasonably priced. Definitely my go to place when I'm coming home late from work"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, placed and order online. Went to pick it up and it wasn't prepared. Then when I got it home to eat it I found a hair in my food. Took a picture and contacted the location who wanted the food back to issue a refund. I laughed because the remaining food was in the trash. The picture I took should have been enough proof. They will no longer have my business or that of my family and friends."}
{"text":"I give Riva's 4 stars because of the secret top burrito in town which is the California burrito and have them put a chilli relleno in the burrito which is the best of all worlds.  So basically this burrito consists of carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo, cheese and a chilli relleno all wrapped up in a delicious tortilla.  Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Great little drive thru, almost a Sunday morning tradition.... love the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"New addition to Surprise and a welcome addition.  I've been a couple of times in the past week and have happy with the food.  

This is the same Rivas that is located in Phoenix and Tempe.  The menu is extensive, prices reasonable, portions large and the food tastes pretty darn good.  

The place won't win any awards for decorations, but the food makes up for it.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner with an assortment of options for each meal.  

This place also has a drive through, which according to the take-home menu is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Cold food - all of our food was cold.  We had a 2 minute drive from the drive thru home and all food was cold...meaning it was never hot to begin with.  This has happened both times I've tried here. Will skip in the future."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I loved everything about it! The decor was nice and the food was great!

I had the beef taco for a buck and boy was that a deal! 

I recommend this place to anyone who is wanting a great meal and is starving for flavor! 

I'll surely be coming here often!"}
{"text":"New Year! New House! New breakfast burritos! To say I was worried about Mexican food in my area after our move is an understatement. I need some sort of burrito factory within a reasonable distance or else why even exist? Our old Ramiro's was pretty good at slinging sour cream and guacamole infused delights so my hunt for its replacement was actually done before the move even commenced. I mean, what great General goes into battle without a well thought out strategy?

Rivas is actually closer than the aforementioned Ramiro's was to our previous residence. Things are starting well. I drove up this morning with one thing in mind; breakfast burritos. Steak, egg, cheese, and potato burritos to be specific. The drive through was pretty standard if not a little cramped but I drive a compact car so this wasn't an obstacle. From order to pick up window was pretty standard, possibly a little faster than average. Price is also average for an establishment like this. So far so good.

The drive home with this type of payload is always horrible. I drive a manual transmission so even trying to single fist a burrito would be a bad idea. These things smelled delish. Upon arriving home, unwrapping, and taking that first bite, my suspicions were confirmed. We have a new burrito place! It was a hot, flavorful party in my mouth and everyone was invited. The steak was a little different flavor than what I was used to due to the spices I assume. But it was a good flavor so I didn't mind a bit. I finished about 3/4 of this sizable meal in a tortilla until I had to tap out. I wanted to go on, but my body said no. Rewrapped and back into the fridge with you, ole' boy! You have just become lunch!

Wrapped food delivery systems are efficient. Arguably a better food system than the almighty sandwich. Remind you I said arguable. Much like sandwiches, though, burritos can be thrown together by just about anyone but that doesn't make it good. Rivas has shown they have what it takes in this field. I see a beautiful relationship developing here."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had here has been great. We especially visit (at least once a week) for the breakfast burritos. You can order them just how you like, which is nice, but let me personally recommend Bacon Potato Egg and Cheese. Whether it's rolled tacos, regular tacos, enchiladas or just chips and guacamole you can't go wrong. All their ingredients seem very fresh and everything is made to order and piping hot when you get it. Good job Rivas and a personal thanks from my husband for being one of the few places who has Mt. Dew!"}
{"text":"So they changed the name and in my opinion the food as well. Had chicken and steak tacos. The shell is different and the filling was decent but nothing compared to what I had here a year ago. 

Its decent but I was sorely disappointed. It makes me sad."}
{"text":"Not sure why they don't have better reviews! We are visiting from Cali and Rivas has great burritos and for a great price! You can tell the ingredients they use are very fresh (carnitas, avocados, chicken...) their salsa is also very good!!! Loved all the options they have on their menu as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been twice for breakfast burritos. Great food, I have tried the Riva' s breakfast burittos with bacon and the chorizo and egg. Both were made quickly and tasted delicious.   Will return to try more items."}
{"text":"Not impressed.. They messed up my order and tried to convince me to keep the burrito because they had already made it. They said it was very good so I agreed.. Turned out that the burrito was disgusting. I was so over it and will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this place, it has gone down hill in a big way.  I've been a customer here for 4 years.  We used to love going here for breakfast burritos.  They were big and delicious & the staff was friendly and courteous.  Now, the burritos are skimpy and flavorless.  The staff is rude and could care less about service or heck, even putting a smile on their faces.  Twice in a row now, my order has been messed up and no apology is given or even a courteous, \"We'll correct that and get it right out to you.\"  Today, I went through the drive thru and again, my order was incorrect.  When I corrected the girl, she actually rolled her eyes at me.  If you are a first time customer, you'll probably think the food's pretty good, but compared to what it was a few years ago, it's not even close to the quality it used to be.  Tack on the quality of service to that and it's just not a place I would recommend at all."}
{"text":"Been here many times mostly due to the hours they keep. Its better than any 'bartos , but prices are still  a little too high. 1 out of the 4 people I've dealt with is rude, but we don't see her much. The shredded beef is way salty, but the chicken and ground beef are good. Drive thru around back! They are open really late, but they need to get some hours posted on here."}
{"text":"Love this place have the best tacos and green chile. Service is usually fast customer service could use a lil more work."}
{"text":"The carne asada steak burritos are amazing and their shredded beef tacos are pretty good with the green sauce. The teenage boy who works here with jersey shore like hair seems very confused.I went to Rivas most recently on 09/23/13 and ordered the usual. After waiting 10-15 (drive-Thru) min to get my food the man who barely spoke English handed me 1 bag  with only half my order. I then asked for the rest and he came back with it but the churro fell out onto the road. He looked at it and said \"oh sorry\" and closed the window quickly. I waited there for another 2-3min waiting to see if he'd come back with a new one and he didn't. When I got home there were no sauces in the bags either. The girls who work there are nice and know how to do their job but the teenage boy not so much! My experiences here are always 50/50. The girls are great, teenage boy not so much. I'd give the food 4 stars and professionalism 2. I've worked years in customer service so maybe I have high standards but the staff can at least smile for once and act like they enjoy their job."}
{"text":"If I had the option to give them zero stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. Their food is great. The last time I was there, the girls were very nice. I just left there not even ten minutes ago. The girl there had a horrible, bitch of an attitude. She made me not want to go back. I'm not sorry for my French, nor am I sorry for interrupting her session on her phone. And when she took our order, she was very very unpleasant. If you don't want to be there, LEAVE! People like her ruin my experience at any restaurant.  So I won't be giving them another dime. I'll be sure to let people not go there either."}
{"text":"Okay 5 stars because they are the alternative to Filibertos style food, without the Filibertos taste.

Its pretty clean and they have a nice salsa bar.  Menu is a little cluttered but they have many combos and different types of items.  If you are lost, order a carne asada burrito.  if u dun like guacamole, order a green chili burrito (pork with green sauce)  real good.

what else do i like about this place, price wise, its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places.  U order at the front, pay and get your own food and drinks and bus the trays after.  

its also 24 hours, so whats not to like ?"}
{"text":"Such yummy place. Our food is always hot! And done correctly!! And they have such yummy salsa!! You for sure have to request plenty Bc they don't give you much. But that's no biggie! I don't give the full 5 stars only Bc they can def work on their customer service skills!! Be a little more polite and have better sense of humor. But it's ok it's usually through the drive through and well...the food is good so can't complain much ?"}
{"text":"This place has saved my life so many times.

I love delicious, gigantic burritos, especially when I can get them 24 hours a day.

Simple and sweet, that's all I need to say about Rivas."}
{"text":"It's good food but service sucks because they never listen to my pick up orders. This is the second time I've done a pick up order for the hash brown burrito with bacon second time without bacon and basically all egg barely even any hash browns."}
{"text":"Rock the Rivas!

It's _bertos clone type shop.

Everything is good and fresh... 

It's cheap and quick.

Their Carne Asada is better than amado's and filli b's.

Hit it up after you're nice and drunk from rocking out at the Yucca Tap Room!"}
{"text":"Ate here in the early afternoon. Boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, I got a shredded beef burrito. His was dripping some weird watery greasy crap..mine made me sick instantly after. Unless I'm eating bean and cheese burritos from here late at night..I'll pass. Why not just go to Amado's or Filly B's?"}
{"text":"To clarify I'm not the Justin V below, whom sucks.  I'm the one who posted the picture which rocks.  That being said what I'm here to talk about is Rivas and the amazing quality and flavor I've grown accustom to upon each and every visit.  Regardless of me being high or drunk when eating within the superb culinary landscape that is Rivas,  the food is spectacular.  I would say even sometimes better when I'm intoxicated (due to high endorphin rushes) or partaking in recreational drugs of which the after effects could increase pleasure.  Either way Rivas is A-OK #1, don't listen to these haters whom believe they can build credibility by changing their names to legit people like myself, mazel tov"}
{"text":"Rivas is your typical authentic style mexican food eatery, although in comparison to the other local restaurants in its same category (Filiberto's, Nico's, Texano's) I believe it is head of its class. Rivas has a super burrito, which is more like the american idea of a burrito(Chipotle style) of putting everything, including rice and beans, inside the burrito. The one area it lacks in is the Pico De Gallo, it seems to repeatedly have too much onion and cilantro in it.  Aside from that I'm a fan of Rivas and the fact that its open 24 hours makes it always a great option!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. The food is good IF you get what you ordered and they made it right, however you can't depend on it. I have had several breakfast burros where I bite into an eggshell piece. Yuck! Also they tend to not get my order quite right about half of the time or leaving off ingredients when I've asked them to or finding something in my food that I wasn't expecting. Usually the nachos are pretty safe. I would go here more if it was consistently good."}
{"text":"Very good, non franchise/chain type of mexican. Large flat top they grilled everything on delivered hot and fresh items. Great pricing and friendly responsive counter help. Recommended for a more street food experience."}
{"text":"The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!"}
{"text":"This place's food is pretty dang awesome.

I ordered the \"Rolled Taco Supreme\" which is four (I think) rolled tacos piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and liberally topped with chopped, tasty carne asada chunks.  With a little pile of lettuce and a \"superior grade\" pico de gallo on the side.

The first time I had this, I literally INHALED IT.  It was that good.

My kids usually have the \"rolled tacos with guacamole\" plate and they dig on it.

Rivas' food is a step above the \"'Ertos\" places if you ask me.  And I've lived here 15 years and eaten at a lot of 'Ertos.

It's not fine dining by any stretch, but it's above average for the classification, and WAY good for a 24-hour joint.

Try it.  Go ahead.  Really.  :)"}
{"text":"I've never been, and I just bought the \"Diego Burrito\"; verdict is...DELICIOUS! The chicken and bacon was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is amazing! My wife got the Torta, and we've hadn't had decent one since leaving California, she really enjoyed it. Can't wait to try more food!"}
{"text":"Always great service, good food and I like the red sauce! Keep up the good work. I usually get the carne asada burrito, rolled tacos or breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Love their taco salads, breakfast burritos and carne asada fries! Staff is friendly and the food is always hot and fresh! Their red salsa is the bomb!"}
{"text":"For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant, this place is as good as it gets. There's nothing like a 3 am burrito or huevos rancheros after a long bike ride down mill. The night time crowd will probably consist of late night weirdos (I myself could be included) and the obnoxious children let out of yucca tap room. It also helps that it's basically across the street from where I often reside.I usually get a burrito with random veggie ingredients or a breakfast burrito and a horchata. There's HUGE portions, cheap prices, and their salsa is tasty too. I believe it's usually cooked to order and they are happy to deal with my picky, custom order. This definitely is gluttonous though so don't expect to feel sexy after eating."}
{"text":"That burrito though! So amazing in my tummy give me more! I will definitely be back for another well prepared bacon, egg, cheese, and potato burrito. Better than the rest....you won't be disappointed and you may even have some left over. I saw on the drive thru window that they now offer a \"King size\" burrito or something to that affect which is crazy considering the size of the regular one. 
Anyway, it's delicious, very well seasoned, tasty tortilla, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best bacon egg cheese and potato burrito I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Oh. Em. Gee. We have a winner! I will definitely be here again and again and again and again. The flavor is unrivaled. Give them a try"}
{"text":"worst service ever! the first time I went there I ordered a breakfast burrito, I went to the drive thru and the service was average; nothing amazing or bad. When I got home to eat the burrito it was super salty. I ate about half of it and couldn't eat another bite. A few weeks later I thought I would give it another shot. I went to pick up a big order for my husband and his friends who were working. I went through the drive thru again but this time the girl at the drive through was not very good. She didn't let me finish placing my order so when I pulled up to the window I told her I wasn't done and that I needed to order something else. She acted annoyed. when they finally brought me my food I asked if everything was in there and they assured me it was. when I finally got home not only had every burrito been labeled incorrectly but they had not included my whole order. I had to drive back and went inside, when I told them what had happened she didn't say anything to me except hold on. The girl then went to the back ( I could see her and the cook) she told them what happened and they started laughing. Needless to say I won't ever be going back there again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. In fact, most of my friends eat here on a regular basis. As for myself, I pretty much live on their steak n egg breakfast burrito. For $4.32, how could you go wrong?! 

The portions are as generous as Mother Theresa. I get a good coma nearly every time I eat here. Perfect for anyone on a budget.. Who needs daily deals when the entire menu is already unbeatable? Almost seems like they're paying is to eat their food. 

As for the grub.. I've never once been let down. Granted, I'm a sucker for anything wrapped in a tortilla (..anything), but I gotta give it to em.. they do great work on Mexican food. Not overly classy, just the right atmosphere to s sit down and enjoy some spicy delectableness. 

I doubt I'll ever love a Mexican food joint more than Riva's. I can die happy with their steak and egg burrito in my hands"}
{"text":"I love Rivas. I would have given 5 stars except that lately their food isn't consistent. I normally order a bean and cheese burrito for my kids, the rolled taco supreme, Carne asada burrito and sopes. Honestly, their food is always good. Lately though I don't know if they changed their meat provider or what the deal is because the carne asada has been really fatty and with a lot of grizzle. Then I decided to get the carnitas instead because of this. The meat was good but I could tell it had been reheated too long and had started to become really dry. Normally their carnitas is moist and good with the perfect amount of crisp on the edges. I really have nothing bad to say about the place. 9.5 times out of 10 that we go its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, have always seen it and wanted to give it a try. Already addicted. Had the Tostada. Shredded beef, beans, lettuce, cheese. Delicious! It was the bomb. This place over Daniels in Surprise. My teenagers enjoyed the Tostadas and enchiladas as well. Quick service too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love the steak burrito. It's filled with steak and guacamole (just those two ingredients) and is great for anyone who has a dairy intolerance.

Prices are very convenient, you can easily stop here and get a great meal for under $10.

It's also open 24 hours."}
{"text":"They have good Mexican food. Although, now you receive smaller portion then before and still pay the same price. Customer service isn't good. One of the main reasons I'm rating it so low and don't recommend anyone to go is because if you decide to go through the drive -thru they take soooooo long, defiantly longer the average and it's usually not even busy. My standards aren't met."}
{"text":"The food is so good here but the service just demolishes their overall appeal. I always get breakfast burritos. I tried to go to the other Mexican food restaurant out here to get better service but they weren't open. They'd really do good by firing some of the front girls. They act annoyed and just couldn't care any less about the service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for the carne asada fries. Not once have I had any problem until yesterday.  I mean it wasn't such a severe problem that I won't go back because it lasts a lot longer than your crispy delicious carne asada fries.  Now saying this makes the carne asada fries from this location sound disgusting by the fries not being crispy enough. They reminded me of steak fries with how thick they were.  I never have had carne asada fries that I happened to like more after sitting out for over an hour than fresh carne asada fries.  

So if I go to work in the morning I would probably enjoy some carne asada fries from rivas BY lunch time. =]"}
{"text":"A personal favorite in Surprise!

Try the Supreme Rolled Tacos w/ Carne Asada."}
{"text":"It has been good in the past, but fairly slow service.  Can be heavy on salt. Today ordered beef chimichanga, slow service as usual. Total was $7.91.  Gave the girl $10.01, she dropped the penny outside the window and gave me $2.19 back instead of $2.10. I guess she didn't count the penny dropped but couldn't count anyway since I got an extra dime. The chimichanga was old and so soggy I couldn't cut through the tortilla that was supposed to be crispy and fried. The whole meal had been microwaved so long that the styrofoam plate  had holes melted all over it and was leaking everywhere. It was gross, and I eat anything!"}
{"text":"Was a loyal customer for a year.  Under new ownership, it's now called Torres Mexican Food and it is awful.  The last 7 orders have been raw (taco shells, tostada shells, etc.). Food isn't cooked after a 10- to 15-minute wait : /  The last order I informed them of this problem and asked them to cook the food (which is a new low in my dining experience).  It came back completely raw.  When I showed it to the PM cashier, she became argumentative and said \"they didn't fully cook it because the items on the menu are no longer offered.\" Seriously???  After I've paid for the order??? This was not a language-barrier issue.  Bad food, worse service.  They just lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Think twice before going here. Received a \"D\" from County Health in April. No thank you! This place just can't get it together."}
{"text":"This is how it went.

Me: Hi, may I have a steak and egg burrito, easy on the cheese, please? Carrots and green sauce, too, please.

Her: Ok

Drive up...and wait, wait, wait. No one was in front of me.

Her: Opens window, tells me amount.

Me: Hand over my card. 

Her: Hands it back.

Me: Wait, wait, wait. 

When I finally get my food, which I've learned to check due to passed experiences, there's SO MUCH cheese that meat and eggs seemed like an afterthought. It also does not look fresh and isn't hot. There is also only red sauce instead of green. I walk back in, still being very polite, plea my case.

Her: Ok. 

Not after 2 minutes, she gives me another burrito. This time the eggs barely cooked, hardly any steak and 2 shreds of cheese. The egg is so undercooked that the tortilla, wrapping and paperbag is soggy. At this point, I'm upset and annoyed. I ask for my money back.

Her: With an attitude, opens the register, puts money on counter and walks away.

{"text":"In pursuit of the Mexican guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/raw onion burrito, I just was not satisfied with what I received.

Sunday afternoon, around 2 PM.  I had taken a stroll to Fry's to get the current beer of preference (Anyone know where I can find Cave Creek Chili Beer?) and on the walk home, I went past Riva's.  The location strikes me as being a drive-through banking location at some time, tho since closed and relocated.  Windows, floors, walls are clean; even the parking lot is clean.  

As the TVs played novelas, I looked at the great variety of offerings, each with a picture in pretty vivid color, along with the name and price.  On approaching the counter, I asked if I could order a custom burrito.  The lady behind the counter asked what kind of burrito I wanted.  I explained the guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/onion burrito.  She asked if I wanted egg on it, and I replied I did not.  She walked the slip to the cook and described the burrito.    

When the lady behind the counter received my wrapped burrito, she put it in a bag with napkins.  I asked about salsa, and she gestured toward the salsa bar.  Since the aluminum roof was down and there was no sign, I had no idea there was a salsa bar.  I packed one container of each salsa, 1 green and 2 red, along with some carrots and jalapenos.  I must express my kudos to the green sauce, a truly fabulous presentation with enough heat to be 'bout right.  No such luck with the red sauce, which seems to derive most of it's heat from black pepper.

Arriving at home, I put the beer in the refrigerator and unwrapped the burrito.  The heft of the burrito gave me pause.  It weighed just over 1/2 lb out of the wrapper.  I was surprised to see nothing had dripped out of the burrito onto the wrapping.  As this was a Hit and Run first try, I did not go into the Preparing for the 'new restaurant first try' experience.  

First bite, I got the slack end of the burrito, so lots of extra tortilla.  Second bite, I was rewarded with meat and onion.  Third bite, I detected cheese and sour cream along with meat and onion, and at the fourth bite, I got evidence of American guacamole.  While I am not sure what size tortilla was used to create this burrito, there was certainly a lot of tortilla folded up.  

I must take the time to inquire next opportunity I get to find out where they get their \"bacon\".  It is certainly the most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.  

For the price, $6.80 plus tax, the burrito was below what I would anticipate.  Guess I need to search out BajaMex or TexMex to find what I am looking for..."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are very good! But the stupid B at the register didn't want to put beans in my friends burrito because they \"don't usually do that\". And on top of that she doesn't speak Spanish and has one of the back people take her orders."}
{"text":"worst Mexican food ever! we had the chile relleno plate and the taco and tostada combination. Food was cold, beans tasted weird they were cold, Spanish rice totally tasteless felt as if you were eaten just steam rice, the only thing we enjoyed was the water! we went there some time ago and did not like it. At that time we ordered burritos that ended up in the trash after the first bite. Since that place is not far from where we live, we wanted to give it a second chance but now we just totally scratched it of our list."}
{"text":"Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!"}
{"text":"so awesome coming here after bar like timeout or monkey pants closes.  I come from a place where there are NO 24 hour burrito places and to me this is stuff of legend.  

$4 for a gigantic burrito.

Get the Cali/Arizona burrito.  SO GOOD.  I cannot confirm or deny the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"The food was alright nothing to brag about. I ordered the supreme nachos and I have ordered the chimichanga now that is crap but the nachos are good.
The service is horrible the girl that worked the drive thru had me repeat my order three times it could of been the speaker that wasn't working. I had her repeat the order when I pulled up to the window. I pay get the food and of course the order is wrong, on top of that the food was cold SMH not the best service I will be finding a new Mexican joint to eat at"}
{"text":"Food is good,  I go through drive through you are waiting for at least 8min.....  
Previous order I asked for taquitos and they we're still cold/ frozen.  , cheese quesadilla some  cheese was not even melted right...."}
{"text":"Yummy!  The Arizona and California Burritos are excellent.  Rivas tastes a bit different than Federico's and is equally as delicious.  If you're in the area, you might as well take a stab at Rivas."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to for decent tex/mex fare. Breakfast burritos are still on point, however their tacos have taken a hit, big time. Almost everywhere in the valley serves 2 tortillas per taco. Rivas's doesn't anymore. Single, tortilla, less fillings and the same price. It's a shame because, as I mention - the Burritos are normally great. I think I'll be passing on this joint from now on."}
{"text":"What can I say? This type of food is pretty common in AZ. I would give it more stars; however, I believe that it tastes the same as anything ending in -berto. But they charge an extra premium for sounding more cultured."}
{"text":"I love this place every time I want to shredded chicken burrito this is where I'll go, at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"Riva's is the flip side of Mexican fast food. Meaning Philiberto's can go suck it!

They seem exactly like any other Mexican fast food joint. To the untrained eye there is no difference...then you get your food and taste the salsa. 

WOW! Someone knows what they are doing. This place consistently kicks out quality food that satisfies. I have always been very happy at the end of the meal, and later on as well!

Drive through as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   We go every single week for Taco Tuesday!   They have the best tacos in town and the nicest staff!"}
{"text":"Just came in with my family and we received amazing service from Alex!  She was very personable and helpful! My family and I have been coming to this Rivas for a while and enjoy their food. One of my favorite places to go when I come into town. You must try the Jamaica-Hibiscus Flower drink!"}
{"text":"I just had the best buritto ever!! It's the Rivas special carne asada buritto!! Delish!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the friendly staff. Way better than the place across the street. Prices are great. Food is hot. Buffalo chicken quesadilla is a gem of a menu item! Lol nailed it!"}
{"text":"This is the best drive thru Mexican food in Surprise! We love the rolled tacos, carne asada burritos and the tacos on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"It's the best I like it better than any 'Bertos chain -'love the carne asada and shredded beef tacos - green sauce is addicting I buy it to take home and keep in fridge for eggs etc"}
{"text":"Let's start off with what they call \"salsa\" it is a watered down salsa. Their menudo is not fresh. No flavor and it's old stomach lining. The color is grey. I shouldn't be this color at all.  Honestly worst place to come for a menudo."}
{"text":"Excellent fast food restaurant. Way better than any of the Bertos. Carne asada has good flavor and seasoning. Green and red hot sauces taste good not super watered down stuff most of these type of restaurants serve. Staff will warm up to you after a few visits. If you need your carne or rolled taco fix this place is great."}
{"text":"I like this place.. after eating terrible \"texmex\" to the point that we don't usually eat Mexican food, this is way more legit. I really have enjoyed everything I have ordered. There were 2xs my husband found the food too salty which is a shock as he is a salt lover. But since then things have been great. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Delicious chorizo and egg burrito. Salsas are okay. Two burritos for about $9, although the burritos are very good size."}
{"text":"I asked if the have Flautas because I didn't see it on the menu and she said yes we order that plus some supreme asada fries extra crispy, mnd you we are in the drive thru and wasn't watching the put it together. When I got home they gave us taqitos and the fries were not well done at all and no forks or napkins. The food was OK bur not what I wanted. The lady was real nice tho. Sorry I normally don't do poor reviews but I'm a little frustrated. Might just be me having a bad day :-/"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have gone there and they have got my order wrong. Once again I paid for something I didn't order and I spent like 20 mins in the drive thru. I get home, we ordered 6 different food items and they give 3 sauces. The food was cold too. Cheese not even melted. Go to Humberto's on Thunderbird just past Dysart they never get it wrong."}
{"text":"So they nearly charged me 5.00 for 3 rolled tacos with Guac ... Their soda machine was down... And then they gave me the wrong change & when I told them they said it's because she didn't tell me the right price. I like the food but can you guys get it together"}
{"text":"I have fond memories of coming here after school to indulge in the rare daytime meal that didn't taste vaguely of styrofoam. A few years and a few dozen burrito joints later, I've discovered this place kinda blows. 

I don't want to make any accusations, but if you told me the sour cream was cut with that \"sour topping\" bullshit, I wouldn't be surprised. 

Their guacamole is watery. 

Their salsas are not spicy or flavorful. They don't add much to the meal. 

At least they didn't screw up the carne asada. I love when it's got that grilled or skillet fried flavor, because it's kinda lame when it comes straight from just a pot. It's a small family-owned place that's got an expansive menu. There are only like 8 chairs inside. I'll try them again for old-times sake, but there's certainly not a rush."}
{"text":"Another spectacular breakfast burrito. If the lunch meals I've had were as good as the aforesaid burritos I would give them more stars."}
{"text":"30 minute wait in a drive thru lane is completely redicolus. There were only 2 cars ahead of us! Way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance"}
{"text":"So there is an argument about this particular establishment at my job. 

One Camp states if you need to be um more....regular....go here.
The other camp loves this place.

I watched this argument for about a year before I decided to try Riva's.
I was glad I did. The portions are very large and tasty. 

I had the chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese and potatoes. I was extremely pleased to see that the burrito didn't eat its way out of the paper bag via grease. 

I have joined the love it camp here at work and for a quick bite I think you will too!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  

This isn't Rivas Mexican Food--it's Torres Mexican Food now, and we seriously wish we never went.

My burro was mediocre at best--absolutely no depth of flavor.  It was like one a large version of one of those frozen, microwaveable burritos from 7-11.  My wife's and daughter's chile relleno plates were actually awful--they left the seeds inside the chiles, making them much too hot.  My daughter is Mexican in heritage and grew up on good homemade Mexican food from her Nana.  For her to complain that the food made her mouth feel like it was on fire really says something.  Even the jamaica was no good--really too sweet.

The final straw came with my bathroom visit.  It smelled like there was a natural gas leak in the men's room.  There was no soap, no paper towels, and the toilet paper roll had bloody fingerprints on it.

Yup, you read that right.  Grossed my ass out.  We are all seriously hoping we don't get sick now.  Never again."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this place.  I went through the drive-thru after a long day of moving.  I think it was about 1am when I ordered.  I ordered two crunchy ground beef tacos and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  The beef in the tacos were burnt and it was the worst taco I have ever eaten.  A complete waste of money.  The quesadilla wasn't much better.

I would not recommend this place to anyone.  The ingredients weren't fresh and the food wasn't cooked properly."}
{"text":"From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the giant breakfast burrito is delicious and huge!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because the kids couldn't decide on what was for dinner so we thought let's try Riva's friendly service and by far some of the best burritos I have ever eaten I don't think we will ever have a hard time deciding what's for dinner again"}
{"text":"Shrimp burrito and Chile relleno burritos were delicious! Fresh rice and beans... first time trying this place and will come again !"}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  The only cooking device I saw used was a microwave.  The foam plate was slightly melted by it.  The burrito had a tough tortilla indicating it was old or microwaved into submission.   I asked for and got a refund.   The food may have tasted good before it was nuked but afterwards was horrible.  Go down the street to and spend .50 more for a meal that is cooked (read not microwaved) and still has flavor."}
{"text":"...is that what I think it is? Yup. Egg shells! You're kidding me right? It adds to the disappointment of NO sour cream that I asked for. They usually aren't bad. Whoever made this burrito should be fired."}
{"text":"I have only had the chicken tacos and they are pretty good. Very Wet meat however, and after one to-go order I have learned to eat-in to avoid soggy shells. They have pollo asada tacos too which I have not tried. 

Meat is tender and tasty and in a light tomato broth which I like despite the fact I am a chicken taco purest and like the chicken to be plain old shredded chicken usually.

I ask for no lettuce, and a side of cut cilantro and onions.There is always alot of cheese which looks to be freshly shredded on site-that is good.  Bonus is that you get a squeeze bottle of green sauce when you eat-in versus to-go you have to beg for extra salsa and I am a green salsa freak and put alot on when I find it at restaurants. I can pile it on here. 

Because the tacos are so wet, almost ahogado style, I use my fork and crunch all the tacos into a big pile and eat with a fork. 

My new 'top 3' chicken taco stop."}
{"text":"Good food and decent prices. The breakfast burritos are my favorite item, specifically the bacon breakfast burrito. I always add beans. Service needs to improve. Cashiers could use more pleasantries (thank you, you're welcome). Nice employees makes the experience better."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp/Siri for helping me find this place. Being a California transplant in Hawaii, I get Mexican food withdraw. Rivas fit the bill. Affordable and freshly made mexican food...with drive thru!

Like others say, the place looks closed but its just uber tinted. The inside is very clean and they have two big screens with sports on. I was just stoked that I got 12 Rolled Tacos/Taquitos smothered with fresh guacamole and cheese for $7.15. WHAT??? Do ya'll know how much this would cost me in Hawaii and it wouldn't even be that good???? Sigh...

Again, just happy to have found my easy-breezy, Mexican food option when I visit my in-laws in surprise. Until next year Rivas...I hope you don't close down."}
{"text":"Ive given this place plenty of trys.. I keep going back because I enjoy the food at the peoria location. The staff here is rude. We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and they had charged and gave us a all beef burrito. We had to drive back up after getting home.. Which we all know is the worst! And when we had gone back the lady acted irritated with us like it was our fault? And then didnt offer to give money back to the difference of price in beans from the beef burrito. We had to ask for the difference $. Then she says they cant really hear through the drive thru speaker, well hmm.. If you knew that then why don't you repeat peoples orders when they get to the window.. Even MCDONALDS does that. Its amazing how bad customer service can make you quit going to a place! No matter how much you like the food."}
{"text":"I read the reviews about the service and let me say my service experience was fantastic. Front was very friendly. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Extremely well priced. Honestly when you can eat this quality of food at near taco bell prices how can you go wrong"}
{"text":"Really good carne asada burritos in the area. Their breakfast chorizo burrito is also really good. For the most part their food is pretty good. Customer service is not the best. I have been coming to this place for years and I would say it is 25% good service to 75% not good. The problem is the cashiers/drive thru service folk dont listen to the customer. But the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably a dozen times since they opened a few years ago. I've probably been pleased 3 or 4 times, but mostly it's very slow service and mediocre food. I really want to like this place since it's close, but doesn't measure up to the other Mexican food places I go to."}
{"text":"On the same level as Taco Bell.  Everything is covered in some-excuse-for-grated-cheddar cheese.

Greasy, too salty, and downright mediocre at best.

Go elsewhere if you want a good meal."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST bean and cheese burrito I've ever had at a casual dining/fast food restaurant. As soon as I tried this one I haven't gone back to any of the other bertos type restaurants. Deeelicious. Their breakfast burritos are very yummy too, the eggs and potatoes are seasoned really well. I'm vegetarian so I haven't had any of the meat, but my husband gets the Surf 'n' Turf burrito or the carne asada nachos all the time and loves it! Only thing is, sometimes they don't listen to everything you want in your burrito, so I would definitely recommend checking inside it before you drive off. 
Also if you're military ask for the discount! 10% :)
Hours are 6am - midnight every day."}
{"text":"Not the worst I've tasted but nothing we'd ever ordered here has left an impression on me. The food is pretty bland and usually has some other problem. The salsa selection is terrible. The young women at the register are never very friendly or just seem to be in a bad mood... This is regardless of the time of day."}
{"text":"This place is great.  First time I came in it was hotter than a mutha inside!  We left because it was packed and we spent the day moving in sweltering heat so we left.  AC issues im sure.  We returned on my next trip out to AZ and it was great.  Ill do it again and again."}
{"text":"I ordered my food and I waited in the drive thru for over 10 minutes (they didn't come to the window to take my money or give me my drink). I had to honk 3 times to get their attention. After I informed the worker that what they did was wrong she closed the window on me. The restaurant had two people in it. Customer service is terrible!"}
{"text":"More like 4.5 stars...but Pretty dang good!! I got the 5 mini tacos carne asada with an horchata. And my husband got a California burrito. Both were excellent! He absolutely loved his California burrito. After hearing so many raving reviews about it, we were not disappointed.
Only 2, slight negatives. It wasn't AS cheap as I had expected and hoped for. We were looking for a quick and cheap meal. But still, it was a TON of food!
And the other is that there were some kinda gross chunky, plasticy feeling bits of fat (just a few) in my steak in the tacos. But I am also picky when it comes to that.
Over all, definitely will be coming back. 
The service was also kind and quick :)"}
